With Life Orb- and Sheer Force-boosted attacks, it is capable of easily OHKOing bulky foes, such as Primal <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/groudon\" hreflang=\"en\">Groudon<\/a>, offensive <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/necrozma-dusk-mane\" hreflang=\"en\">Necrozma-DM<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ho-oh\" hreflang=\"en\">Ho-Oh<\/a>, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/toxapex\" hreflang=\"en\">Toxapex<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Access to a wide array of coverage moves makes Landorus harder to defensively handle. Landorus's ability to harshly punish common Ground-immune Pokemon with Hidden Power Ice and Sheer Force-boosted Rock Slide makes it considerably difficult for many teams to switch into.<\/li>\n<li>A unique Speed tier lets Landorus outpace common foes, such as Primal Groudon, Primal <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/kyogre\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyogre<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/xerneas\" hreflang=\"en\">Xerneas<\/a>, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/yveltal\" hreflang=\"en\">Yveltal<\/a>. This lets Landorus viably run a Rash nature to make its attacks even more powerful.<\/li>\n<li>Landorus's ability to force many switches, pressure Defog <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus<\/a> formes, and threaten common Stealth Rock setters like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM gives it a solid role compression as a wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter.<\/li>\n<li>However, Landorus is relatively frail, and it doesn't have any notable resistances and immunities apart from being immune to Ground. Even this cannot be properly taken advantage of due to Ground-types like Primal Groudon and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus-ground\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus-Ground<\/a> being able to OHKO Landorus on the switch.<\/li>\n<li>Landorus's frailty and lack of useful resistances leave it vulnerable to essentially every faster foe, such as support Arceus formes, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/salamence-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Salamence<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/lucario-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Lucario<\/a>, and every Choice Scarf user. This makes it very hard for Landorus to function against any offensive teams.<\/li>\n<li>These detrimental factors leave Landorus hard to justify and overshadowed by other strong attackers like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/rayquaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Rayquaza<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/lunala\" hreflang=\"en\">Lunala<\/a>, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mewtwo\" hreflang=\"en\">Mewtwo<\/a>; the former two have much more spammable STAB moves and perform much better against offensive teams, while the latter has a significantly better Speed tier and even wider options for coverage moves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","comments":"<h1>Other Options<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus Blast allows Landorus to 2HKO <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela<\/a>, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory<\/a> while doing the same to <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey<\/a> once Eviolite has been removed.<\/li>\n<li>Sludge Wave gives Rash Landorus a chance to take out Geomancy <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/xerneas\" hreflang=\"en\">Xerneas<\/a> after Stealth Rock damage but has almost no relevant use outsides of this.<\/li>\n<li>Gravity allows Landorus to temporarily hit Flying-types with Earth Power, but this relies on a forced switch to be set up and also leaves Landorus and its teammates vulnerable to Ground-type moves, which can be detrimental against threats like Primal <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/groudon\" hreflang=\"en\">Groudon<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus-ground\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus-Ground<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Landorus has access to setup moves such as Calm Mind and Rock Polish. The former might be an appealing option that boosts Landorus's sheer power to even further levels, but it isn't efficient due to Landorus having to run a mixed moveset to effectively wallbreak. The latter boosts Landorus's Speed and potentially allows it to clean up late-game, but this is simply outclassed by other setup sweepers like Primal Groudon and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/necrozma-dusk-mane\" hreflang=\"en\">Necrozma-DM<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Checks and Counters<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Faster Foes<\/strong>: Landorus's poor bulk leaves it vulnerable to most faster threats in the tier. Most support <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus<\/a> formes, although they are 2HKOed by Earth Power, naturally outspeed Landorus, have access to Recover to keep themselves healthy, and commonly employ Ice Beam, which can easily dispose of Landorus. <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/salamence-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Salamence<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/marshadow\" hreflang=\"en\">Marshadow<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/deoxys-attack\" hreflang=\"en\">Deoxys-A<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mewtwo\" hreflang=\"en\">Mewtwo<\/a>, and Ultra <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/necrozma\" hreflang=\"en\">Necrozma<\/a> can outspeed and OHKO Landorus. Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/yveltal\" hreflang=\"en\">Yveltal<\/a> can easily KO Landorus after some prior damage.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/lugia\" hreflang=\"en\">Lugia<\/a><\/strong>: Thanks to its massive bulk that is further complemented by Multiscale and an immunity to Earth Power, Lugia can switch into Landorus with impunity and threaten to KO back with Ice Beam or set Landorus on timer using Toxic. It is quite hindered by a well-timed Knock Off, however.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/giratina-origin\" hreflang=\"en\">Giratina-O<\/a><\/strong>: Giratina-O's great defensive stats and Levitate allow it to switch into most of Landorus's moves, and even Knock Off fails to do much damage due to Griseous Orb. However, it is susceptible to residual damage and is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice, so it cannot consistently switch into Landorus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ground-immune Steel-types<\/strong>: Celesteela, Skarmory, and the rare <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/bronzong\" hreflang=\"en\">Bronzong<\/a> are immune to Earth Power and take at most neutral damage from Rock Slide.

It can thus be used early to pressure foes and set Stealth Rock on forced switch.<\/li>\n<li>It's difficult to switch Landorus into any sort of attacks due to its frailty, so it is strongly advised to switch it in through pivoting or an aggressive double switch.<\/li>\n<li>If Landorus opted for Stealth Rock, pay attention to the opposing team and figure out which Pokemon have a chance to carry Defog. While Landorus can pressure Defog users like Arceus formes and practically most Flying-types, it tends to struggle doing much against the likes of Giratina-O, Lugia, and Skarmory. Therefore, it is better to weaken or eliminate them so Landorus can effectively set Stealth Rock and keep it on the opposing field.<\/li>\n<li>On the other hand, if Landorus opted for Knock Off, it can be a more potent wallbreaker that hinders its checks like Lugia and Chansey by removing their items. Since opponents have tendencies to switch Flying-types like Lugia and Celesteela and special walls like Chansey and Blissey into Landorus, it is better to use Knock Off early instead of recklessly spamming Earth Power so Landorus or its teammates can deal with them easier.<\/li>\n<li>Landorus takes Life Orb recoil from every use of Knock Off and Hidden Power Ice and thus should use them with care, or it will unnecessarily wear itself down over the match.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>Team Options<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Landorus serves as a powerful wallbreaker that can disrupt defensive teams relatively well; therefore, it fits well on teams that can benefit from weakened or hindered walls.<\/li>\n<li>Primal Groudon can opt to run more offensive sets if Landorus has Stealth Rock. In exchange, Primal Groudon can switch into Primal <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/kyogre\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyogre<\/a> and threaten Ground-immune Steel-types. Variants with Toxic can lure in Lugia, support Arceus formes, and Giratina-O and put them on a timer. Should Landorus forgo Stealth Rock, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus-fairy\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus-Fairy<\/a> is an effective option that checks <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/marshadow\" hreflang=\"en\">Marshadow<\/a> and Yveltal, and it can also threaten Giratina-O.<\/li>\n<li>Necrozma-DM can take advantage of Landorus's defensive checks such as numerous Arceus formes and Chansey. Offensive variants can set up on foes like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus-water\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus-Water<\/a> and Celesteela, while defensive variants can run Stealth Rock to let Landorus run Knock Off and maximize its wallbreaking potency. Defensive Necrozma-DM also serves as a consistent switch-in to Arceus formes, which are Landorus's common switch-ins.<\/li>\n<li>Various Arceus formes provide Landorus with a shelter from attacks. Most of them are capable of checking faster foes like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/lucario-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Lucario<\/a> thanks to their Speed and Mega Salamence if carrying Ice Beam. Arceus-Water in particular proves to be a solid partner thanks to its ability to handle problematic foes like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/arceus-ground\" hreflang=\"en\">Arceus-Ground<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Yveltal pressures Lugia and Giratina-O and draws in Magearna and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tyranitar\" hreflang=\"en\">Tyranitar<\/a>, which Landorus can take advantage of. Variants with U-turn can bring Landorus in safely. <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/scizor-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Scizor<\/a> and Magearna can also serve as pivots that can bring Landorus in safely while additionally checking Fairy-types and switching into Toxic.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gengar-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Gengar<\/a> appreciates the presence of a strong wallbreaker that threatens bulky foes such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Magearna, and Tyranitar, all of which it would otherwise struggle against. Landorus also rids Blissey and Skarmory of Shed Shell and allows Mega Gengar to trap and remove them. In return, Mega Gengar can trap Lugia and certain Arceus formes, depending on their typing, or force a trade with an offensive threat that Landorus struggles to deal with by using Destiny Bond.<\/li>\n<li>Setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Swords Dance Arceus, and Mega Lucario appreciate Landorus setting Stealth Rock and putting massive holes in the opposing team. Xerneas appreciates Landorus threatening Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Magearna while removing Chansey's Eviolite with Knock Off, leaving it unable to check Xerneas later in the match. Swords Dance Arceus can pick on weakened teams with ease with boosted Extreme Speed and can take advantage of Celesteela, Chansey, and other passive defensive Pokemon if using Substitute. Mega Lucario switches into Toxic from the likes of Lugia, Celesteela, and Chansey and uses the latter two as a setup fodder while threatening <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Marshadow greatly appreciates Landorus threatening Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Toxapex. It can also potentially use different sets, since Landorus has a tool that Marshadow will otherwise need, such as Hidden Power Ice and a Rock-type move. Marshadium Z variants especially do an excellent job taking out support Arceus formes, Giratina-O, and Lugia for Landorus. Marshadow in general appreciates Landorus's high damage against defensive cores and Stealth Rock support.<\/li>\n<li>Especially if Landorus opted for a Rash nature, Sticky Web is a strategy that can be employed. If said entry hazard is set up, Landorus becomes an even greater threat that can threaten support Arceus formes with Defog by potentially 2HKOing them with Earth Power. Due to Landorus's inability to threaten Defog users such as Giratina-Oand Lugia, Taunt users such as Yveltal and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mewtwo\" hreflang=\"en\">Mewtwo<\/a> can fit alongside it in this strategy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","abilities":["Sheer Force"],"items":["Life Orb"],"teratypes":[],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Earth Power","type":null}],[{"move":"Rock Slide","type":null}],[{"move":"Stealth Rock","type":null},{"move":"Knock Off","type":null}],[{"move":"Hidden Power","type":"Ice"}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":4,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":0,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Rash","Naive"]}],"credits":{"teams":[{"name":"Quality checked by","members":[{"user_id":212134,"username":"Nayrz"},{"user_id":426631,"username":"Serial"}]},{"name":"Grammar checked by","members":[{"user_id":231476,"username":"Fireflame"},{"user_id":232216,"username":"Lumari"}]}],"writtenBy":[{"user_id":434601,"username":"Lotus"}]}},{"format":"Monotype","overview":"<h1>Flying<\/h1>\n<p>Landorus is a fantastic special wallbreaker for Flying teams, as the combination of Sheer Force, a Life Orb, and a wide movepool is extremely powerful and difficult to defensively counteract. Being a Ground-type is already desirable for Flying teams, as the Electric-type immunity is greatly appreciated against Pokemon such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos<\/a>, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zeraora\" hreflang=\"en\">Zeraora<\/a>. Its Speed tier also narrowly edges out potent threats such as Mega <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/charizard\" hreflang=\"en\">Charizard<\/a> X, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/kyurem-black\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem-B<\/a>, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/volcarona\" hreflang=\"en\">Volcarona<\/a>. Landorus has a decent amount of bulk for its offensive prowess, so it can take at least one hit, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela<\/a>'s Heavy Slam or <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mew\" hreflang=\"en\">Mew<\/a>'s Psychic. However, Landorus is susceptible to Water- and Ice-type moves from foes such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ninetales-alola\" hreflang=\"en\">Alolan Ninetales<\/a>. Landorus faces competition from <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T<\/a>, as that forme better checks potent threats to Flying teams such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/diancie-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Diancie<\/a> and Tapu Koko when running a Choice Scarf.<\/p>\n<h1>Ground<\/h1>\n<p>Landorus is the best special attacker Ground teams have to offer and one of the best special wallbreakers in the metagame. What makes it such an amazing wallbreaker is the combination of its good base 115 Special Attack, its Sheer Force ability, and the added power of Life Orb in addition to being able to freely change moves between each turns, in contrast to most other wallbreakers, which tend to use Choice items. Additionally, its Speed tier is just high enough to outspeed a multitude of Pokemon sitting at base 100 Speed and below, enabling it to outspeed dangerous threats like Mega Charizard Y and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/hydreigon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hydreigon<\/a>. Landorus's Earth Power is extremely powerful and, along with nice coverage in Sludge Wave and Focus Blast, Landorus can KO a great number of threats like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/victini\" hreflang=\"en\">Victini<\/a>, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu<\/a>, and Kyurem-B. In particular, the combination of Sludge Wave and Focus Blast nicely helps Landorus deal with Grass teams, which Ground teams usually struggle against. Landorus also has access to useful support moves in Gravity to pressure Flying teams and support its teammates, Knock Off to remove the items from foes, which helps to break past the Normal-type defensive core, and Rock Polish to become a late-game cleaner. As a wallbreaker, Landorus sports decent bulk that lets it survive powerful hits like Choice Specs <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/blacephalon\" hreflang=\"en\">Blacephalon<\/a>'s Shadow Ball and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/scizor-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Scizor<\/a>'s Swords Dance-boosted Bullet Punch. Unfortunately, even with its nice Speed tier, Landorus gets outsped and OHKOed by threats like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/greninja\" hreflang=\"en\">Greninja<\/a>, Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Also, Landorus's Ground / Flying typing exacerbates the Water- and Ice-type weaknesses commonly found on Ground teams, meaning fast users of such moves as well as Aqua Jet and Ice Shard users severely threaten Landorus and many of its teammates. Finally, even though Landorus is considered more viable than its Therian counterpart, using Landorus means you won't be able to add the reliable setup sweeper that is Landorus-T as a teammate.<\/p>\n","comments":"<h1>Other Options<\/h1>\n<section><h1>Flying<\/h1>\n<p>Knock Off can be used in Landorus's last moveslot as a better countermeasure to one of its best checks in <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey<\/a>, as it can remove its Eviolite and let Landorus damage it more effectively through its special attacks. However, teammates such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gliscor\" hreflang=\"en\">Gliscor<\/a> can run Knock Off with better consistency. Calm Mind also can be used in place of Rock Slide, as it boosts Landorus's powerful Special Attack to greater heights. However, Landorus is already strong enough to break down nearly everything and in Monotype, so Calm Mind is a bit redundant. Rock Polish can also be used in the last slot with a Modest nature as a means of checking faster attackers in <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/greninja\" hreflang=\"en\">Greninja<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/lopunny-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Lopunny<\/a>, but then Landorus can no longer outspeed foes such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/kyurem-black\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem-B<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/porygon-z\" hreflang=\"en\">Porygon-Z<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>Ground<\/h1>\n<p>Calm Mind lets Landorus become a balance breaker, pressuring multiple defensive cores like the dual Eviolite core on Normal teams and the <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/sableye-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Sableye<\/a> + <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mandibuzz\" hreflang=\"en\">Mandibuzz<\/a> core commonly found on Dark teams. However, Ground teams have their fair share of wallbreakers and strong sweepers to manage those kinds of cores and would rather have Landorus sport a support move like Gravity to help the entire team instead. Rock Slide, which is preferred over Stone Edge because of its comparable damage output due to Sheer Force and better accuracy, can be used to OHKO Mega <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/charizard\" hreflang=\"en\">Charizard<\/a> Y and deal major damage to other Flying-types like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mantine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mantine<\/a>, but it has little use in other matchups like Grass and Normal and much less overall utility than Gravity and even Knock Off. Focus Blast allows Landorus to threaten even more walls, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/porygon2\" hreflang=\"en\">Porygon2<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ferrothorn\" hreflang=\"en\">Ferrothorn<\/a>, in addition to some airborne threats like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory<\/a> and Air Balloon <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/heatran\" hreflang=\"en\">Heatran<\/a> outside of Gravity. Knock Off can be used instead of Rock Polish to remove items like Chansey's Eviolite, which enables Landorus to break the Normal-type defensive core for its teammates.<\/p>\n<\/section><h1>Checks and Counters<\/h1>\n<section><h1>Flying<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Ice-types<\/strong>: Ice-types like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ninetales-alola\" hreflang=\"en\">Alolan Ninetales<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine<\/a> can easily OHKO Landorus with their STAB and priority moves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Water-types<\/strong>: Water-types such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo<\/a>, Greninja, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/suicune\" hreflang=\"en\">Suicune<\/a> can pressure Landorus with their STAB moves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenge Killers<\/strong>: Faster foes like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/latios\" hreflang=\"en\">Latios<\/a>, Mega Lopunny, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko<\/a> can threaten to revenge kill Landorus.

Landorus can run Stealth Rock to allow teammates such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gliscor\" hreflang=\"en\">Gliscor<\/a> to run other options. Alternatively, Rock Slide helps against opposing Flying-types, which are immune to its Ground-type STAB move, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mantine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mantine<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos<\/a>. However, using Rock Slide over Stealth Rock isn't as ideal, since it's harder to fit on teammates such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/aerodactyl-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Aerodactyl<\/a> and Skarmory, as they need that extra moveslot to fulfill their roles.<\/p>\n<h1>Set Details<\/h1>\n<p>Maximum Speed investment allows Landorus to be as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/kyurem-black\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem-B<\/a> and Mega <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/charizard\" hreflang=\"en\">Charizard<\/a> Y. A Timid nature is utilized to boost its Speed to its peak without lowering one of its defensive stats. Alternatively, Landorus can use a Naive nature if it's using Rock Slide to boost its power. Landorus could use a Hasty nature to minimize damage taken from special attacks and, most notably, survive a Hidden Power Ice from <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko<\/a>, though it no longer takes Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/victini\" hreflang=\"en\">Victini<\/a>'s V-create from full HP. Sheer Force and a Life Orb are powerful when used together, as Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil to amplify Landorus's damage output.<\/p>\n<h1>Usage Tips<\/h1>\n<p>Landorus can be used as an early-game wallbreaker or sometimes as a lead, since its power and coverage options are very difficult to counteract defensively. Use teammates with pivoting options such as Volt Switch Zapdos and U-turn <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tornadus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Tornadus-T<\/a> to bring in Landorus safely, as this will keep up offensive pressure against the opponent. Take advantage of switches Landorus forces by setting up Stealth Rock against slower, weaker foes. Landorus can also act as a potent revenge killer against weakened foes and slower threats like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/nidoking\" hreflang=\"en\">Nidoking<\/a> and non-Choice Scarf Victini. While Landorus has decent bulk, it should avoid taking unnecessary damage in order to wallbreak as much as possible. Setting Stealth Rock isn't always necessary, especially against foes such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/swampert\" hreflang=\"en\">Swampert<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mew\" hreflang=\"en\">Mew<\/a> that look to set up Stealth Rock of their own. Watch out for Ice-type coverage from foes such as Tapu Koko and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/greninja\" hreflang=\"en\">Greninja<\/a>, as they can OHKO Landorus. It's also ideal to avoid Knock Off users like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/deoxys-speed\" hreflang=\"en\">Deoxys-S<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/sableye-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Sableye<\/a>, as removing Landorus's Life Orb lessens its damage output. Landorus also provides an Electric immunity by virtue of its Ground typing, but it must be careful of coverage such as Hidden Power Ice.<\/p>\n<h1>Team Options<\/h1>\n<p>Zapdos is a solid switch-in to Water-types that threaten Landorus, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/suicune\" hreflang=\"en\">Suicune<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gyarados\" hreflang=\"en\">Gyarados<\/a>. Its ability to utilize Defog, provide momentum through Volt Switch, and stall out bulkier foes such as Swampert through Substitute and Toxic can create better opportunities for Landorus to sweep teams. Mantine is a defensive pivot into Ice- and Water-type attacks for Landorus, as the former is a neutrality for Mantine while it completely walls the latter due to Water Absorb. It also has incredible special bulk that it can use to check special attackers such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/blacephalon\" hreflang=\"en\">Blacephalon<\/a> and Greninja and can also use Defog to remove entry hazards for Flying teams. Mega Charizard Y can threaten Ice-types such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/cloyster\" hreflang=\"en\">Cloyster<\/a>, as well as bulkier Water-types like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro<\/a> through the combination of Drought and Solar Beam, for Landorus. In return, Landorus can switch into incoming Electric-type attacks for Mega Charizard Y. Mega Aerodactyl can check Ice-types such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/weavile\" hreflang=\"en\">Weavile<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/ninetales-alola\" hreflang=\"en\">Alolan Ninetales<\/a> for Landorus, and it's also able to Pursuit trap weakened foes such as Choice Scarf Victini and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/latios\" hreflang=\"en\">Latios<\/a> that can threaten Landorus. Additionally, having Landorus take care of Stealth Rock allows Mega Aerodactyl to be an incredible asset against Dragon teams, as it would be able to use both Stone Edge and Pursuit to threaten the biggest threats to Flying teams such as Kyurem-B and Latios. Tornadus-T acts as utility for Landorus, as it removes Stealth Rock that can chip away at Landorus's health while also having access to Knock Off, which allows it to remove <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey<\/a>'s Eviolite for Landorus. It's also a fast pivot that can consistently grasp momentum for Flying teams through U-turn and Regenerator. <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela<\/a> is a general wall for Landorus, providing security against powerful priority users such as Mamoswine and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/dragonite\" hreflang=\"en\">Dragonite<\/a> while also being able to use Leech Seed to help Landorus regain some of its HP if need be. Gliscor is another defensive pivot for Landorus, and it can also relieve some pressure off of Landorus from switching into Electric-type attacks thanks to its Ground typing and better recovery. Dragonite can break special walls, such as Chansey and Mantine, while Landorus can break down physical walls for Dragonite such as Toxapex and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/avalugg\" hreflang=\"en\">Avalugg<\/a>. Skarmory assists Landorus by stacking entry hazards against foes without Ground-type immunities through Spikes and its own Stealth Rock, and it can also Defog away Stealth Rock that would chip away at Landorus and its teammates.<\/p>\n","abilities":["Sheer Force"],"items":["Life Orb"],"teratypes":[],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Earth Power","type":null}],[{"move":"Sludge Wave","type":null}],[{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}],[{"move":"Stealth Rock","type":null},{"move":"Rock Slide","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":0,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":4,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Timid"]},{"name":"Special Wallbreaker (Ground)","pokemon":"Landorus","shiny":false,"gender":"DC","levels":[],"description":"<h1>Moves<\/h1>\n<p>Earth Power, coupled with Sheer Force and Life Orb, is Landorus's strongest STAB move, enabling it to deal considerable damage to physical walls like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/slowbro\" hreflang=\"en\">Slowbro<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/venusaur-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Venusaur<\/a>. Sludge Wave is used as a way to hurt problematic Grass-types, OHKOing dangerous threats like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-bulu\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Bulu<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/breloom\" hreflang=\"en\">Breloom<\/a>. Outside of Gravity, Sludge Wave also hits most Flying-types for neutral damage. Gravity greatly helps Landorus and its teammates against Flying and Steel teams, as it enables Landorus and the rest of the team to deal with troublesome threats found on these teams like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos<\/a>, Mega <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/charizard\" hreflang=\"en\">Charizard<\/a> Y, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/celesteela\" hreflang=\"en\">Celesteela<\/a> that would be very problematic to deal with otherwise. Rock Polish, on the other hand, lets Landorus clean opposing teams late-game by almost outspeeding the entire metagame, including some threats like Modest <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/raichu-alola\" hreflang=\"en\">Alolan Raichu<\/a> in Electric Terrain, <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko<\/a>, and Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/keldeo\" hreflang=\"en\">Keldeo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>Set Details<\/h1>\n<p>Sheer Force boosts all of Landorus's STAB and coverage moves except Knock Off by a factor of 1.3, thus making it a terrific wallbreaker. Life Orb should be the only item used on Landorus, as it improves its damage output even further without having to suffer the recoil damage thanks to Sheer Force. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs coupled with a Timid nature are used so that Landorus can be as fast and strong as possible. If Landorus uses Knock Off in its fourth moveslot, the 4 Special Defense EVs should be moved to Attack and a Naive nature should be used instead to avoid lowering its Attack stat, enabling it to achieve certain KOs like an OHKO on <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/latios\" hreflang=\"en\">Latios<\/a> after Stealth Rock damage. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty so that Landorus can better tank priority moves coming from the likes of <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/azumarill\" hreflang=\"en\">Azumarill<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/scizor-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Scizor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>Usage Tips<\/h1>\n<p>As a wallbreaker, Landorus is best used to punch holes early-game so it can pave the way for its teammates to eventually sweep or clean the opposing team. Even with its decent bulk, it's preferable to bring Landorus onto the field against weak attackers, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/skarmory\" hreflang=\"en\">Skarmory<\/a> and opposing <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/hippowdon\" hreflang=\"en\">Hippowdon<\/a>, or after a teammate has fainted, as it's still easily 2HKOed by a vast number of Pokemon like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/lopunny-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Lopunny<\/a> and opposing <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/excadrill\" hreflang=\"en\">Excadrill<\/a>. Because Landorus has such a fantastic damage output, it often forces opponents to switch in their specially defensive Pokemon, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/chansey\" hreflang=\"en\">Chansey<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mantine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mantine<\/a>. If Landorus cannot seriously harm them, it's often best to switch out to a physical wallbreaker like Excadrill or <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/mamoswine\" hreflang=\"en\">Mamoswine<\/a>. If Landorus is running Knock Off, however, removing the special wall's item might be more profitable than switching out. Gravity is best used in matchups like Flying, Steel, and Electric where there are numerous airborne threats. More specifically, Landorus can set up Gravity when forcing a passive Pokemon like Skarmory to switch out or when it's being sacrificed against slower Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard Y and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/rotom-wash\" hreflang=\"en\">Rotom-W<\/a>. In the instance that Landorus carries Rock Polish, the best course of action would be to not set up until late-game, when its checks, such as Keldeo and Latios, are weakened, and to safely do so against Pokemon that are more likely to switch out. Having many viable options for its last move as its disposal, Landorus can use that unpredictability to its advantage by concealing its last move, if possible, until an opportunity opens up. In the long run, the opponent will have to carefully play around it, whether it's to not lose any Ground-immune Pokemon, to preserve its special wall's item, or to avoid being swept clean late-game. However, for whatever move Landorus has in its final moveslot, it's important to try and keep Landorus away from status, as status will chip down its health rather quickly, especially if entry hazards are to be taken into account. Furthermore, opposing Knock Off users can remove Landorus's Life Orb and make it considerably less powerful, preventing it from achieving certain OHKOs, such as against Celesteela with Gravity support, and 2HKOs, such as against <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/sableye-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Sableye<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>Team Options<\/h1>\n<p>All of Landorus's teammates really enjoy Gravity support, as it lets them freely spam their Ground-type STAB moves against Flying-types and other airborne threats. <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/seismitoad\" hreflang=\"en\">Seismitoad<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gastrodon\" hreflang=\"en\">Gastrodon<\/a> are both great additions to any Ground team due to their Water immunities and Ice neutralities. Seismitoad can stop Belly Drum Azumarill's sweep with Sludge Wave and get rid of Chansey's Eviolite with Knock Off, while Gastrodon can repeatedly switch into <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/greninja\" hreflang=\"en\">Greninja<\/a>'s and Keldeo's moves due to its superior longevity. <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/dugtrio\" hreflang=\"en\">Dugtrio<\/a> is a superb offensive teammate for Landorus, as after the latter has set up Gravity, Dugtrio can trap airborne threats like Mega Charizard Y and Celesteela that couldn't be trapped otherwise. Additionally, Dugtrio can trap and dispose of Chansey and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Bulu and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/kyurem-black\" hreflang=\"en\">Kyurem-B<\/a> for Landorus. In return, Landorus can deal with physical walls like Skarmory and Slowbro. Sand Rush Excadrill can form a potent wallbreaking core with Landorus because they can blast through each other's checks. Furthermore, Excadrill can clean opposing teams after Landorus has punched holes in them, outspeeding and KOing most opposing threats, especially against Fairy and Ice teams. Hippowdon is a great switch-in to fast and strong physical attackers that would severely weaken or outright KO Landorus, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/gallade-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Gallade<\/a> and Choice Scarf <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/victini\" hreflang=\"en\">Victini<\/a>. Hippowdon can also set Stealth Rock so that Landorus can OHKO threats like Focus Sash Breloom and offensive Mega Scizor. Swords Dance <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/garchomp\" hreflang=\"en\">Garchomp<\/a> is one of the few setup sweepers found on Ground teams and can take advantage of Landorus's early wallbreaking to inflict severe damage upon the opposing team. It can also dispose of numerous threats that Landorus has a hard time against, such as Chansey and Mantine, while Landorus takes out physical walls like Skarmory and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/clefable\" hreflang=\"en\">Clefable<\/a> for Garchomp. Mamoswine and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/garchomp-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Garchomp<\/a> can also wallbreak alongside Landorus and overwhelm troublesome Flying, Grass, and Normal teams. As a bonus, Mamoswine can switch into Ice-type moves aimed at Landorus, while Mega Garchomp, in addition to being neutral to Water-type moves that Landorus is weak to, is bulky enough to survive Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer or Azumarill's +6 Aqua Jet before KOing them in return with Fire Blast and Earthquake, respectively.<\/p>\n","abilities":["Sheer Force"],"items":["Life Orb"],"teratypes":[],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Earth Power","type":null}],[{"move":"Sludge Wave","type":null}],[{"move":"Gravity","type":null}],[{"move":"Rock Polish","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":0,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":4,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Timid"]}],"credits":{"teams":[{"name":"Flying analysis by","members":[{"user_id":391540,"username":"Havens"}]},{"name":"Ground analysis by","members":[{"user_id":256316,"username":"GnralLao"}]},{"name":"Earlier versions by","members":[{"user_id":271507,"username":"TheAce22"},{"user_id":239907,"username":"Vid"}]},{"name":"Quality checked by","members":[{"user_id":100418,"username":"Eien"},{"user_id":279058,"username":"terrors"},{"user_id":239907,"username":"Vid"},{"user_id":221862,"username":"Zarif"},{"user_id":215618,"username":"Moosical"},{"user_id":314540,"username":"Kev"},{"user_id":243751,"username":"Tyke"},{"user_id":305839,"username":"maroon"}]},{"name":"Grammar checked by","members":[{"user_id":232216,"username":"Lumari"},{"user_id":388157,"username":"A Cake Wearing A Hat"},{"user_id":100418,"username":"Eien"},{"user_id":168392,"username":"P Squared"},{"user_id":384270,"username":"martha"}]}],"writtenBy":[{"user_id":391540,"username":"Havens"},{"user_id":256316,"username":"GnralLao"}]}},{"format":"Doubles","overview":"<p>Though often overshadowed by its Therian counterpart, Incarnate Landorus is a considerable force in its own right, easily dealing with common Steel- and Fire-types courtesy of its iconically powerful Sheer Force-backed Earth Power, which is notably unaffected by both Grassy Terrain and Wide Guard, two huge problems to most Earthquake users. However, it still faces competition from special <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/landorus-therian\" hreflang=\"en\">Landorus-T<\/a> for a team slot; though Landorus hits much harder, it lacks the Therian forme's key selling point of Intimidate. Perhaps precisely because it lacks Intimidate, Landorus is also heavily threatened by opposing speed control and even faster foes, which can take advantage of its relative lack of bulk to quickly KO it. Landorus is also hurt by the ubiquity of Ice-type coverage attacks, a consequence of the high usage of <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zygarde\" hreflang=\"en\">Zygarde<\/a> and Landorus-T.<\/p>\n","comments":"<h1>Other Options<\/h1>\n<p>A Yache Berry allows Landorus to win the matchup one-on-one against <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/metagross-mega\" hreflang=\"en\">Mega Metagross<\/a> and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-koko\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Koko<\/a>, taking their respective Ice-type attacks and OHKOing in return with Earth Power. A Choice Scarf set can also win these one-on-one matchups, but with a Yache Berry, Landorus retains the ability to switch moves. Rock Slide offers a more accurate alternative to Stone Edge, but the reduced power is a significant dropoff. If Landorus doesn't need additional coverage, it can set Stealth Rock for its teammates. Alternatively, setting up a Substitute provides Landorus some protection from moves that would otherwise KO it.<\/p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters<\/h1>\n<p><strong>Ice-types<\/strong>: Ice-types hit Landorus for quadruple damage and can easily OHKO it, as it tends to hold neither a Yache Berry nor a Focus Sash.

Finally, U-turn offers fast pivoting to a Choiced attacker, while Protect keeps Life Orb Landorus safe for the turn and helps it stall out opposing Tailwind and Trick Room, which would otherwise pose a large threat.<\/p>\n<h1>Set Details<\/h1>\n<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Landorus can take out fast Ground-weak threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Metagross or pivot out of bad matchups before having to tank a hit. This set can also use a Life Orb to further boost the power of Landorus's attacks with secondary effects; as a bonus, Sheer Force prevents recoil damage from the Life Orb. The given EV spread and nature maximize Landorus's Special Attack and Speed stats, allowing it to get the most damage and guaranteeing that it can outrun a boosted Volcarona and various popular Choice Scarf users like <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/genesect\" hreflang=\"en\">Genesect<\/a>, Tapu Lele, and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/victini\" hreflang=\"en\">Victini<\/a>. Life Orb sets will also outpace the denizens of the well-populated base 100 Speed tier.<\/p>\n<h1>Usage Tips<\/h1>\n<p>Although Landorus's high-powered attacks are very threatening, its Speed tier and lack of general bulk put it at risk when against faster foes. Landorus is best used either early-game, to put severe dents in bulky foes to clear the way for the rest of the team, or late-game, to clean up a match once major threats to it have been removed and many bulkier foes have been put into range to be KOed by Earth Power. Choice Scarf sets make for decent leads, since a fast U-turn enables them to pivot out of potentially poor matchups. Despite its typing lending it immunities to both Ground- and Electric-type attacks, Landorus should not be switched in during a turn, as its mediocre bulk puts it at risk of taking heavy hits from opposing attacks; instead, Landorus is best brought in after a partner has been KOed or off the back of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Landorus's quadruple weakness to Ice means that it must be wary even around the Electric-types it should beat, as such foes, including Tapu Koko and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/zapdos\" hreflang=\"en\">Zapdos<\/a>, are often either immune to Earth Power, can outspeed it and OHKO it with Hidden Power Ice, or both. Zapdos can further worsen Landorus's standing on the field speed-wise by setting up a Tailwind. Indeed, opposing speed control greatly threatens Landorus, as it prefers to move first in order to deal with threats before they can damage it; therefore, one's own speed control is key in order to allow it to continuously exert pressure on the opponent.<\/p>\n<h1>Team Options<\/h1>\n<p>Steel-types such as Genesect and Mega Metagross pair well with Landorus, appreciating its ability to beat Fire- and Steel-types with Earth Power while threatening Ice-types such as Kyurem-B for it. Other attackers like Tapu Lele and <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/nihilego\" hreflang=\"en\">Nihilego<\/a> also benefit from the removal of Fire- and Steel-types and can threaten Kyurem-B. Due to Landorus's glaring weakness to Water- and Ice-type attacks, it should be paired with one or more partners capable of switching into those, such as <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/tapu-fini\" hreflang=\"en\">Tapu Fini<\/a> or <a href=\"/dex/sm/pokemon/suicune\" hreflang=\"en\">Suicune<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another important aspect of Landorus's potential teammates is their access to speed control, which Landorus appreciates greatly in order to keep it moving before its threats, allowing it to get the most use out of its devastating Earth Powers. This speed control can come in several forms, such as Icy Wind and Tailwind; notable users of each include Icy Wind Kyurem-B and Tailwind Zapdos and Suicune.<\/p>\n","abilities":["Sheer Force"],"items":["Choice Scarf","Life Orb"],"teratypes":[],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Earth Power","type":null}],[{"move":"Sludge Bomb","type":null},{"move":"Stone Edge","type":null}],[{"move":"Hidden Power","type":"Ice"}],[{"move":"U-turn","type":null},{"move":"Protect","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":0,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":4,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Timid"]}],"credits":{"teams":[{"name":"Quality checked by","members":[{"user_id":232101,"username":"talkingtree"},{"user_id":221349,"username":"shaian"}]},{"name":"Grammar checked by","members":[{"user_id":232216,"username":"Lumari"},{"user_id":331519,"username":"CryoGyro"}]}],"writtenBy":[{"user_id":118474,"username":"Level 51"}]}},{"format":"1v1","overview":"","comments":"","movesets":[{"name":"Life Orb","pokemon":"Landorus","shiny":false,"gender":"DC","levels":[],"description":"","abilities":["Sheer Force"],"items":["Life Orb"],"teratypes":[],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Earth Power","type":null}],[{"move":"Rock Slide","type":null}],[{"move":"Substitute","type":null},{"move":"Hidden Power","type":"Ice"},{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}],[{"move":"Sludge Wave","type":null},{"move":"Hidden Power","type":"Ice"},{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":0,"atk":4,"def":0,"spa":252,"spd":0,"spe":252}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Naive"]},{"name":"Choice Scarf","pokemon":"Landorus","shiny":false,"gender":"DC","levels":[],"description":"<p>For full USUM 1v1 analyses, you can check out <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/1v1/\">the USUM format page<\/a>.<\/p>\n","abilities":["Sheer Force"],"items":["Choice Scarf"],"teratypes":[],"moveslots":[[{"move":"Rock Slide","type":null}],[{"move":"Earth Power","type":null}],[{"move":"Sludge Wave","type":null},{"move":"Hidden Power","type":"Ice"}],[{"move":"Focus Blast","type":null},{"move":"Hidden Power","type":"Ice"}]],"evconfigs":[{"hp":4,"atk":36,"def":24,"spa":196,"spd":0,"spe":248}],"ivconfigs":[],"natures":["Naive"]}],"credits":{"teams":[],"writtenBy":[]}}]}]],"showEditorUI":null,"showAds":true}
