  "Venusaur": {"sets": {"Sun Sweeper": {}}},
  "Ninetales": {
    "overview": "<p>Ninetales serves as RU's premier sun setter due to its superb offensive utility in support of the weather-based attackers ran alongside it, usually consisting of Chlorophyll users like Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant, as well as strong Fire-types like Entei and Armarouge. Additionally, its decent bulk and Speed allow it to consistently use its ability to set up sun multiple times throughout a match. Ninetales's weakness to Stealth Rock, caused by its inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots, is made up for through utility options in Encore, which discourages setup and recovery; Will-O-Wisp, which cripples physical attackers; and Healing Wish, which restores damaged sweepers and wallbreakers to a healthy state. While Ninetales provides assistance to its allies through sun, the opposite can also be true, as it gives a boost moves used by already threatening foes like Entei's Sacred Fire and Armarouge's Armor Cannon. The tier is no stranger to weather either, with all forms of it having some semblance of viability, which creates strife in Ninetales's job to keep up sun for the majority of a game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Overheat and Scorching Sands shore up Ninetales's less-than-threatening offensive presence, though they come at the cost of consistent damage output and utility. Memento can be used over Healing Wish to give easier setup opportunities for teammates like Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant, though this comes at the cost of the team's overall longevity. Tera Ghost can be ran over Grass to provide additional utility, giving it the properties of a spinblocker, as well as a Fighting-type immunity.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hippowdon &amp; Other Opposing Weather Setters</strong>: With Ninetales's main role being to set sun for its team, foes that have the ability to change the weather threaten it. Hippowdon is the most common of the weather setters in the tier with its Sand Stream ability, and it also threatens a super effective Earthquake as well as having the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Politoed's Drizzle and Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning also change the sun Ninetales sets up into a different weather.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: The likes of Volcanion, Armarouge, and Entei all have free entry on Ninetales, as they all take negligible damage from Flamethrower and Energy Ball; they are also immune to Will-O-Wisp and gain a boost to their STAB moves thanks to the sun.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Cyclizar and Noivern are unthreatened by sun-boosted Flamethrower and can switch in to get free chip damage and momentum, only being pestered by Will-o-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock &amp; Knock Off</strong>: Stealth Rock's sizable chip damage can make Ninetales more vulnerable over the course of a game and hinder its role in setting up sun multiple times, decreasing sun's presence in the game. Similarly, having Ninetales be hit by a Knock Off will remove its Heat Rock, cutting down the turns that sun is active.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Flamethrower is preferred over the more powerful Weather Ball to let Nintales consistently beat Hippowdon; however, Weather Ball sets can run Energy Ball to circumvent its Sandstorm. Healing Wish allows Ninetales to be useful even when it's low on health, providing another opportunity for teammates such as Venusaur, Hisuian Lilligant, and Scovillain to sweep. Alternatively, Energy Ball threatens switch-ins such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon better. Encore is an excellent utility move that gives Ninetales an opportunity to bring in sweeper teammates such as Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant for free against foes such as Recover Reuniclus and Roost Noivern by locking them into these status moves. Additionally, it prevents Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mew from using Ninetales as setup fodder. Will-O-Wisp cripples switch-ins such as Hippowdon and Hisuian Goodra, as well as ruining physical attackers such as Krookodile and Mimikyu. Nasty Plot can be used over Will-O-Wisp to give Ninetales a more offensive presence. Heat Rock extends the period of Drought, making sun sweepers like Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant more threatening. Ninetales should generally never use Terastallization, as its offensively minded teammates will almost always be better users of it. However, Ninetales can use Tera Grass to turn the tables on Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, Hippowdon, and Krookodile.</p> <p>Ninetales exclusively fits on dedicated sun teams. It can be used over Torkoal on such teams, trading entry hazard control for utility such as Encore and Healing Wish. Chlorophyll sweepers such as Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant best make use of Ninetales's sun as both setup sweepers and wallbreakers. Espeon fits well on sun teams providing them the ability to completely block hazards from being set up. Espeon's Morning Sun recovery is also improved, and it further benefits from sun with Weather Ball, melting Steel-type Pokemon such as Jirachi and Bisharp. Similarly, Necrozma and Cresselia enjoy the boosted healing that sun gives to Moonlight, which allows them to set up safely. Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei and Armarouge are also good partners, as sun greatly strengthens Sacred Fire and Armor Cannon, respectively. Pivots such as Eject Button users like Amoonguss, Slowbro, and Klefki can take a hit and freely pivot into Venusaur, Hisuian Lilligant, or Scovillain to effectively utilize sun turns. Klefki in particular can set up sun with Prankster Sunny Day, and it has Spikes to further aid sweepers. Forretress and Jirachi are good partners, as they set up hazards.</p>"

  "Ninetales-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Ninetales carves out a niche for itself thanks to the combination of its high Speed and being the only relevant Pokemon with access to both Aurora Veil and Snow Warning. In conjunction with Encore to cripple slower Pokemon that often use status moves like Bisharp and Cresselia, this lets it support its teammates fairly well. Its high Speed lets it outrun foes like Krookodile and Terrakion, and the Defense boost provided by snow lets it take priority moves from slower wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Crawdaunt. Additionally, Alolan Ninetales can act as a rare specially offensive Ice-type with Nasty Plot to punch holes in teams. However, its typing leaves it with a myriad of common weaknesses, including to Stealth Rock; this often forces Alolan Ninetales to choose between extending the duration of its snow or not getting nailed by entry hazards. Without Terastallization, offensive Alolan Ninetales sets lack the coverage to muscle through the Steel-types that resist both of its STAB moves, like Jirachi and Registeel, which limits the flexibility of its team. Alolan Ninetales's Special Attack is also relatively low, meaning without sufficient boosts it's walled by Pokemon like Volcanion and Hisuian Goodra. Additionally, while Alolan Ninetales's Speed is solid, it's still outsped by common Pokemon like Gengar and Barraskewda.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the Nasty Plot set, Aurora Veil can be run over Encore in order to bolster Alolan Ninetales's defenses as it sweeps. Ice Beam is an alternative Ice-type STAB move that has higher Base Power than Freeze-Dry as well as more PP than Blizzard while being consistently accurate, making it more reliable against bulky teams. A Calm Mind + Draining Kiss set can be used to wear down bulkier structures while keeping Alolan Ninetales healthy; however, its low Special Attack means that it requires multiple boosts in order to properly muscle through defensive Pokemon like Umbreon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: When Alolan Ninetales lacks Tera Blast Ground, defensive Steel-types like Registeel, Jirachi, and Empoleon can comfortably take hits from it before threatening it with a 4x super effective STAB move. More offensive Steel-types like Bisharp and Magnezone also threaten it; however, neither likes taking Nasty Plot-boosted attacks from Alolan Ninetales, and Bisharp risks being locked into Swords Dance or Sucker Punch by Encore.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Armarouge, Volcanion, and Entei resist both of Alolan Ninetales's STAB moves and can retaliate with super-effective STAB moves of their own. However, all three must be wary of Tera Blast Ground.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Gengar and Maushold are able to comfortably outspeed Alolan Ninetales before either nailing it with their powerful attacks or crippling it with Trick or Encore. Choice Scarf Pokemon like Terrakion and Krookodile are also able to outspeed and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: In addition to being able to take Alolan Ninetales's attacks fairly comfortably, Politoed can prevent Aurora Veil from being set at all simply by switching in and replacing snow with rain. Hippowdon and Ninetales can also set sand or sun, respectively, in order to deny Aurora Veil; however, the former has difficulty switching in due to its Ice weakness, and the latter is a rather niche option.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Alolan Ninetales leverages its high Speed and rare offensive typing to act as an effective Nasty Plot sweeper that can dismantle common threats such as Cyclizar, Slowbro, and Krookodile. Freeze-Dry is a reliable STAB option that hits Water-types that could wall Alolan Ninetales otherwise for super effective damage like Gastrodon and Suicune. Blizzard is Alolan Ninetales's most powerful STAB move, notably guaranteeing an OHKO on Rhyperior after a Nasty Plot boost; however, it is much less accurate outside of snow. Encore can be used to cripple setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia as well as utility Pokemon like Vaporeon, while Moonblast is a consistent STAB option that targets the likes of Umbreon and can KO Pokemon that would tank a Freeze-Dry like Krookodile or Galarian Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Blast Ground patches up Alolan Ninetales's biggest offensive weaknesses, targeting Steel-types like Magnezone and Jirachi as well as Fire-types like Armarouge and Volcanion. Defensively, Tera Ground removes many of Alolan Ninetales's weaknesses, notably giving it a resistance to Rock-type attacks from the likes of Rhyperior and Terrakion as well as an immunity to Thunder Wave from Jirachi. However, Terastallizing removes the Defense boost snow provides, putting Alolan Ninetales at risk of being OHKOed by Mienshao's Close Combat.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales fits best on bulky offense structures that can whittle down its checks. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Cyclizar and Talonflame ensure that Alolan Ninetales can come in safely even if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed. Knock Off from the aforementioned Cyclizar as well as Krookodile can remove Leftovers from defensive Pokemon that lack reliable recovery, such as Hisuian Goodra and Registeel, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Volcanion and Entei, making them easier to wear down so that Alolan Ninetales can sweep late-game. Fighting- and Ground-types like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Krookodile also make for great partners by virtue of being able to threaten the Steel-types that otherwise check Alolan Ninetales while appreciating their ability to dispatch the most common weather setter in the tier: Hippowdon. Water-types like Crawdaunt and Basculegion-F appreciate Alolan Ninetales's ability to break past Grass-types such as Wo-Chien and Chesnaught; in exchange, they can threaten the Fire-types that resist its STAB combination like Armarouge. Barraskewda is another great Water-type partner for Alolan Ninetales, as it can threaten to KO faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Krookodile thanks to its blistering Speed and access to Aqua Jet. Choice Scarf revenge killers, such as Jirachi and Krookodile, can similarly handle faster threats like Gengar in order to enable a sweep. Setup sweepers, like Bisharp and Gyarados, appreciate Alolan Ninetales's ability to create setup opportunities with Encore.</p>"
      },
      "Aurora Veil": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Alolan Ninetales provides both snow and support for its teammates, either granting protection with Aurora Veil or disrupting foes with Encore, enabling them to overwhelm the opposing team. Aurora Veil allows allies to set up with greater ease and protects them from retaliation. Encore can lock foes like Slowbro and Armarouge into setup moves like Calm Mind, healing moves like Slack Off, or other unfavorable moves, allowing Alolan Ninetales's teammates to enter the field unopposed. Snowscape can allow Alolan Ninetales to ensure the desired weather stays up in the face of other weather setters like Hippowdon and Politoed. Moonblast deals strong damage to Umbreon and Terrakion, while Freeze-Dry can hit Water-types like Slowbro and Gastrodon. Icy Rock extends the window that allied Pokemon can take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning. While Alolan Ninetales does not want to Terastallize often, preferring for its allies to make use of it, Tera Water flips its weaknesses to Fire and Steel, allowing it to survive attacks from Entei and Jirachi. In addition, it is a great defensive type and removes Alolan Ninetales's weakness to Stealth Rock, though losing its Ice typing will result in it no longer benefitting from snow's Defense boost.</p> <p>Aurora Veil Alolan Ninetales fits almost exclusively on a single archetype: snow. As such, it should be paired with the most potent user of it, Belly Drum Cetitan, which often needs the protection provided by Aurora Veil in order to set up. Other Slush Rush sweepers like Alolan Sandslash and Beartic can also take advantage of the weather. Other Pokemon that benefit from snow are potential Weather Ball users like Volcanion, Raikou, and Kilowattrel, providing a means to damage Pokemon like Cyclizar and Chesnaught more effectively. Due to the low duration of Aurora Veil, Alolan Ninetales needs to be paired with pivots that can reliably get its allies in, a role that Eject Button Slowbro and Amoonguss can excel at. Entry hazard control is important for snow teams, which can come in the form of Defog Talonflame and Noivern or Rapid Spin Cyclizar, each of which can cover Alolan Ninetales's weakness to Fire and pivot with U-turn. Alternatively, Magic Bounce Espeon or Hattrem can prevent entry hazards from being set up at all, though their frailty can make them unreliable. Aurora Veil is also a benefit for any setup sweeper, even on non-snow teams, such as Gyarados and Armarouge.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its typing, high HP and Defense, and access to Regenerator, Slowbro does a fantastic job at slowing down or outright stopping some of the most dangerous wallbreakers and setup sweepers of the tier in their tracks, including the likes of Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, Terrakion, and Barraskewda. In addition to being one of the best damage sponges in the tier, Slowbro also has a vast arsenal of offensive and disruption tools, including Scald, Psychic Noise, Thunder Wave, and Future Sight. These attributes allow Slowbro to trade hits remarkably well against many defensive pieces of the tier, like Jirachi, Cyclizar, Hippowdon, and Registeel. This resilience allows Slowbro to use Calm Mind in order to turn into one of the deadliest late-game sweepers the tier has to offer, ending games after it wins the war of attrition against opposing tanks. Despite all these attributes, Slowbro is not unstoppable in what it's set out to accomplish. Its typing and lower Special Defense leaves Slowbro vulnerable to the many Ghost- and Electric-type attackers roaming the tier, such as Gengar, Basculegion-F, and Magnezone. The strongest wallbreakers in the tier, such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos and Crawdaunt, can overpower Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Slowbro also struggles against wallbreakers with super effective STAB attacks, such as Crawdaunt, Bisharp, and Mimikyu, without expending Tera. Because the Pokemon that Slowbro checks often carry Knock Off, it often finds itself losing its item quite early, leaving it vulnerable to passive damage from hazards and status, particularly Toxic, without Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers to mitigate it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Covert Cloak protects Slowbro from Psychic Noise's heal-blocking effect from Reuniclus and opposing Slowbro and status from Scald from Suicune. Colbur Berry reduces damage taken from Knock Off, making it safer to switch into threats such as Krookodile and Mamoswine. Body Press can be used to immediately threaten Bisharp and Cyclizar. Iron Defense makes Slowbro much safer against the likes of Bisharp and Mimikyu and is extremely effective against teams with little pressure on the special side when paired with Body Press. Trick + Choice Scarf cripples defensive Pokemon such as Wo-Chien, Empoleon, and Chansey that would otherwise answer Slowbro's other sets while allowing it to steal the foe's Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers after Slowbro absorbs Knock Off for its team. Choosing Psyshock over Psychic Noise allows Slowbro to beat opposing Calm Mind users not running Psyshock themselves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Ghost- and Electric-type attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark, Basculegion-F, and Magnezone threaten huge damage on Slowbro, even after a Calm Mind boost. Other strong special attackers, such as Gardevoir and Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra, can also overpower Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Slowbro is unable to switch into the tier's strongest Choice Band wallbreakers, such as Galarian Zapdos, Crawdaunt, and Golurk, without risking getting KOed after minimal chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Toxic poison is a death sentence for Slowbro, as it is then unable to stay on the field to threaten the attackers it tries to repeatedly stop over the course of a game such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and completely invalidates late-game Calm Mind tactics. This often forces Slowbro to expend Tera to accomplish its goal against teams running Toxic Spikes or the likes of Toxic Amoonguss, Gligar, and Umbreon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water- and Grass-types</strong>: Wo-Chien completely stops Slowbro from making progress and almost always wins in one-on-one situations thanks to its typing, bulk, Leech Seed, and Ruination. Other defensive picks such as Grass Knot Empoleon and Shadow Ball Suicune can slow down Slowbro, but they have to be careful against Calm Mind Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Because Slowbro will often lose its Heavy-Duty Boots early in the game, Spikes stacking teams can force Slowbro to use Slack Off often, making it much more passive and vulnerable against the Pokemon it wants to check. This can drain Slack Off's 8 PP quickly.</p> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: Usual stallbreaking tools such as Taunt, Encore, and Trick + Choice Scarf slow Slowbro down considerably. Encore from the likes of Jirachi and Politoed and Trick + Choice Scarf from Gardevoir and Jirachi, entirely prevent late-game Calm Mind tactics from working.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Slowbro makes for one of the best physical walls and late-game cleaners in the metagame. It acts as an excellent check to a wide variety of Pokemon such as Terrakion, Barraskewda, and Jirachi. Calm Mind allows Slowbro to turn into a threatening late-game cleaner capable of ending games easily. Scald can punish switch-ins to special sponges like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra and Dark-type physical attackers like Bisharp and Crawdaunt. Psychic Noise is preferred over Psychic and Psyshock to stop bulky and setup Pokemon from recovering, making matchups against Noivern, Reuniclus, and Suicune more favorable. Slack Off and Regenerator give Slowbro incredible longevity and the ability to consistently set up with Calm Mind during the course of the game. Heavy-Duty Boots is an excellent item that allows Slowbro to make full use of its ability in Regenerator to stay healthy throughout the game. Rocky Helmet is also useful, as Slowbro switches into the many Close Combats, Iron Heads, Liquidations while also checking Maushold and dealing damage passively. Tera Poison makes Slowbro immune to Toxic from the likes of Umbreon, Amoonguss, and Quagsire; keeps its invaluable Fighting resistance while granting it a Fairy resistance and removes its Dark- and Bug-type weaknesses to consistently check Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and others. Tera Fairy rids Slowbro of its Ghost-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses.</p> <p>Calm Mind Slowbro fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, as they enjoy its ability to check the many physical attackers running around the tier. Cyclizar makes for a great partner because it resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks and is immune to Ghost-type attacks, while Slowbro resists Fighting-type attacks and other strong physical attacks for Cyclizar and its teammates. Cyclizar also acts as a sponge for the many special attacks aimed at Slowbro and as entry hazard control. Amoonguss pairs well with Slowbro because it forms a Regenerator core alongside Slowbro while preventing it from getting poisoned from the likes of Quagsire and Umbreon. Amoonguss also eases the pressure off of Slowbro by helping in answering the plentiful physical attackers in the tier. Hippowdon acts similarly in checking physical attackers while also aiding Slowbro against Electric-types like Rotom-Heat, whereas Slowbro switches into Water-type attacks for Hippowdon. Krookodile is a good partner for Slowbro, as it enjoys Slowbro's ability to check Fighting- and Water-types like Terrakion and Barraskewda, while Slowbro appreciates Krookodile's ability to set Stealth Rocks, remove items with Knock Off and take care of the Steel- and Ghost-types like Hisuian Goodra and Gengar that threaten Slowbro. Talonflame and Jirachi are excellent teammates because they form great synergy with Slowbro and are good Pokemon in general due to their ability to spread status and act as pivots while throttling setup attempts with Taunt and Encore, respectively.</p>"

      "Future Sight": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro is among the best physically defensive walls in the tier with great bulk, multiple forms of recovery, and the ability to use Terastallization very efficiently against a good portion of the metagame. Scald allows Slowbro to punish switch-ins to Dark-types that come in to stop Future Sight, such as Bisharp and Overqwil while also threatening to burn specially defensive walls like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon. Future Sight has great damage output and enables Slowbro's teammates to force uncomfortable matchups during a game. Thunder Wave, similarly to Future Sight, can enable teammates to apply offensive pressure through forcing switches. Slack Off, combined with Regenerator, makes Slowbro very difficult to take down. A maximum HP and Defense Slowbro with Bold nature has seemingly unbreakable bulk on the physical side, comfortably switching into some of the premier physical threats like Barraskewda, Terrakion, and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Fairy is used to flip the weaknesses to Bug- and Dark-type, maintain the important Fighting-type resistance, and is generally a good Tera type defensively. Tera Poison keeps the Fighting-type resistance and can prevent Slowbro from becoming poisoned, usually the best means of taking it down, although it does make the matchup into Psychic-types like Reuniclus and opposing Slowbro more difficult.</p> <p>Future Sight Slowbro provides incredible offensive and defensive synergy within many team structures and is especially good on balance or bulky offense teams. Slowbro is often paired with other Regenerator users such as Amoonguss, Cyclizar, and Mienshao to form cores that are very difficult to break and can wear teams down offensively through hazard damage and gradual chip from U-turn and Future Sight. Slowbro can support teams through paralysis spam with other teammates like Bellibolt and Jirachi, enabling offensive options like Basculegion-F and Gengar to take advantage of the boosted Hex damage or slow wallbreakers like Golurk and Crawdaunt to outspeed most of the metagame. Slowbro generally likes to be paired with teammates that can absorb special attacks and are immune to Poison, such as Registeel and Jirachi. To maximize the use of Future Sight, you often want to run physical attacking Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Terrakion, since Future Sight will lure in specially defensive walls such as Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon as well as Dark-types like Bisharp and Alolan Muk.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Slowbro is difficult to take down thanks to its great physical bulk, multiple forms of recovery in Regenerator and Slack Off, and solid defensive typing. Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro can snowball quickly, being able to stack up multiple boosts in the face of premier physically offensive threats like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion while threatening to sweep entire teams. With access to perfectly accurate Toxic, Galarian Slowbro finds plenty of opportunities to disrupt after coming in on physical wallbreakers. However, some physical attackers have the necessary tools to break through it, including staples in the tier like Krookodile and Mamoswine which can threaten massive damage with strong Ground-type attacks. Fitting the coverage to hit the plethora of Poison- and Steel-types can also be difficult, so Pokemon like Amoonguss, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi can limit Galarian Slowbro's effectiveness as a bulky offensive setup option. Likewise, strong special wallbreakers like Gardevoir and Gengar can threaten to take down Galarian Slowbro before it can establish multiple boosts, forcing it out and deterring setup attempts. Despite access to similar movepools, Slowbro has a tangible upside with moves like Psychic Noise and Scald, and it often fulfills the role of a physical wall and bulky setup sweeper better than Galarian Slowbro can.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Galarian Slowbro has access to Thunder Wave, which can be quite disruptive and can enable slower wallbreakers like Volcanion and Crawdaunt. Nasty Plot can be used over Calm Mind to expedite the offensive boosting at the cost of being susceptible to special wallbreakers more easily. Belly Drum sets, with Quick Claw and Quick Draw, can be unreliable but incredibly dangerous with access to strong attacks like Drain Punch, Earthquake, and Shell Side Arm. Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, and Surf are other special attacks that can be used for coverage to hit the likes of Slowbro and Krookodile for more damage immediately.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: In a metagame with strong Psychic-types like Armarouge, Jirachi, Mew, and Necrozma, Galarian Slowbro can find itself struggling to capitalize on its physical bulk to set up with Calm Mind reliably. Similarly, Slowbro is among the best Pokemon in the tier and can both compete directly with Galarian Slowbro for a spot on a team while also threatening to win Calm Mind setup battles reliably, especially given its better natural bulk and access to great disruptive attacks like Psychic Noise and Scald.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Without establishing multiple Calm Mind boosts, Galarian Slowbro is especially vulnerable to the plethora of special wallbreakers in the tier, such as Gengar, Basculegion-F, and Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Encore, Taunt, and Trick</strong>: Disruptive moves like Encore and Taunt can cause major issues for Galarian Slowbro, as it is incredibly slow and will struggle to set up against the bevy of users like Noivern, Gengar, and Mew. Trick can be used by Choice item users, like Gardevoir, Jirachi, and Cresselia, to significantly hinder Galarian Slowbro, as locking into any of its moves can be easy to capitalize on for the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Pivot Spam</strong>: While Galarian Slowbro can absorb many of the attacks from the premier physical wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao, it is susceptible to being used as U-turn fodder for safe entry points for other strong pivot users, like Kilowattrel and Magnezone. Being caught in the blender of pivot spam can quickly wear down Galarian Slowbro and make standing up to the onslaught of physical attacks much more difficult. As it often finds itself switching into Knock Off, Galarian Slowbro is especially vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Galarian Slowbro is a competent physical wall that can fulfill multiple roles, such as spreading poison, forming Regenerator cores, and being a bulky setup sweeper. In conjunction with its exceptional physical bulk, Calm Mind can make it a herculean task to bring down Galarian Slowbro after a few boosts, and opportunities to set up can be easy to find in a metagame filled with physical wallbreakers that struggle to beat it. Flamethrower is a strong option to hit Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra, Jirachi, and Revavroom. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Galarian Slowbro to function more capably as a defensive pivot throughout a game, while Covert Cloak can prevent secondary effects like Body Slam paralysis and Psychic Noise recovery-blocking from Jirachi and Slowbro. Regenerator ensures Galarian Slowbro can continue to function as a switch-in to physical attackers multiple times as needed. Tera Water eliminates the weakness to Ground-type attacks, creating opportunities to set up against Krookodile and Mamoswine more comfortably. Tera Water also neutralizes the output of strong Ghost- and Psychic-type special attacks, rendering Gengar, Jirachi, and Basculegion-F less capable of beating it after a Calm Mind boost.</p> <p>A stalwart option for balance and bulky offense teams, Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro is an excellent fit for teams looking to shore up their physical bulk while also hoping to create setup opportunities to clean late-game. Working well in tandem with specially defensive pivots like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon that can absorb special attacks from threats like Gardevoir and Gengar, Galarian Slowbro can function as a stout physical wall to form resilient defensive cores that wear the opposition down gradually for stronger teammates like Basculegion-F and Gengar to clean up late-game. Cyclizar and Mienshao are notable teammates that can form Regenerator cores with Galarian Slowbro to maintain health throughout a game, with both providing Knock Off and U-turn support. Capitalizing on this type of support, Galarian Slowbro teams can keep the pressure on with entry hazard support from the likes of Hippowdon, Krookodile, and Registeel. Covert Cloak sets are weak to hazards, which can offset most of the recovery from Regenerator, so hazard control support from Cyclizar and Noivern is especially beneficial. Offensive options that can capitalize on Galarian Slowbro are fast wallbreakers, such as Entei, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos, that can beat the Steel- and Psychic-types that come in on it, like Empoleon, Jirachi, and Magnezone.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Defensive Galarian Slowbro fulfills the role of physical wall and disruptor well, capable of absorbing attacks from the wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion while disrupting everything else with Toxic. Psyshock is stronger against specially defensive foes like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra, offering a means to wear them down faster for its teammates. Psyshock also hits Calm Mind setup sweepers like Suicune and opposing Galarian Slowbro harder than Psychic would. Flamethrower melts Steel-types like Jirachi and Magnezone sufficiently. Toxic is Galarian Slowbro's main form of making progress, as it can help wear down many of its switch-ins like Flygon, Hippowdon, and Vaporeon. Heavy-Duty Boots helps ensure Galarian Slowbro remains healthy throughout a game to effectively pivot in against physical attackers, while Colbur Berry provides a valuable one-time resistance to Knock Off from strong threats like Crawdaunt and Krookodile. Tera Water removes the weakness to Ground and Ghost, allowing Galarian Slowbro to more effectively check Krookodile and Swords Dance Mimikyu. Tera Ghost can be used to provide a Normal immunity, functioning as a spinblocker against Cyclizar as well as a valuable switch-in to Population Bomb Maushold. Tera Ghost also provides a valuable resistance to Bug, which helps absorb strong U-turn from Choice Band users like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao.</p> <p>Defensive Galarian Slowbro is a stout choice for balance and bulky offense teams looking for a reliable physical wall and Toxic user. Regenerator cores consisting of Cyclizar, Mienshao, and Galarian Slowbro are incredibly effective at switching into all sorts of attacks for each other and using the combination of Knock Off, U-turn, and Toxic to wear the opponent's team down quickly. Entry hazard support from the likes of Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Krookodile can help these teams by forcing chip damage on wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion, both of which struggle to break through Galarian Slowbro reliably. Specially defensive teammates that can tank the Ghost-type attacks from threats like Gengar and Basculegion-F, such as Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, Umbreon, and Registeel, form excellent defensive cores with Galarian Slowbro that can bulk a majority of attacks seamlessly. Offensive teammates that can capitalize on this gradual chip damage include fast wallbreakers like Choice Scarf users Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Krookodile as well as setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Mimikyu. Hazard removal support is vital for Colbur Berry sets, so teammates like Cyclizar and Noivern are valuable to keep Galarian Slowbro healthy enough to reliably check physical wallbreakers multiple times as needed.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Utilizing its large special bulk and the incredible progress-making combination of Poison Touch and Knock Off, Alolan Muk stands out as a potent special wall in the tier. Common special attackers such as Gengar and Volcanion struggle to get past it and are forced out by Knock Off. Alolan Muk can be incredibly difficult to switch into for defensive teams, as common walls like Slowbro and Hippowdon hate losing their items and potentially getting poisoned. However, Alolan Muk can struggle a lot against powerful physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Mamoswine, as they deal massive damage to it. Alolan Muk also relies entirely on Rest to keep itself healthy throughout a battle, leading it to be potentially overwhelmed or exploited if it cannot find safe opportunities to burn sleep turns.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse can be utilized on Alolan Muk to try and turn it into a sweeper, but it generally doesn't have the power or bulk to effectively sweep after setting up. Shadow Sneak can be used in order to pick off weakened foes, but with no STAB boost, it is pretty weak and only does good damage to Pokemon weak to it such as Gengar and Mimikyu. Protect can be used on stall teams so that Alolan Muk can safely absorb Future Sight from Pokemon like Reuniclus and Slowbro, and it can allow Alolan Muk to gain even more Leftovers recovery. Assault Vest can be used to increase Alolan Muk's special bulk but prohibits the use of Rest, thus heavily cutting into its longevity; due to this, Assault Vest Alolan Muk is relegated to more offensive teams. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used in order to solve Alolan Muk's entry hazard weakness, but this cuts into its longevity and forces Alolan Muk to use Rest more often against repeated attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Bisharp can easily switch into Knock Off and threaten Alolan Muk back. However, Steel-types that rely on their items for recovery such as Registeel and Hisuian Goodra still do not like taking Knock Off, and they have to be wary of Drain Punch, which can allow Alolan Muk to potentially win one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Krookodile can target Alolan Muk's Ground weakness while also easily taking Poison Jab. However, they do not like getting poisoned by Poison Touch, as that lessens their longevity.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao can easily take Alolan Muk's Knock Off and threaten it out with Close Combat. However, some item-reliant Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos still do not appreciate the item removal, and all of the Fighting-types still are threatened by the poison chance.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Due to Alolan Muk's reliance on Leftovers, hazards can heavily cut into its longevity, forcing Alolan Muk to use Rest more often. Spikes setters such as Chesnaught and Quagsire can not only force Alolan Muk out but also make it more difficult for Alolan Muk to switch in over the course of a game due to the Spikes they set up.</p>",

Haze allows Alolan Muk to stop setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Slowbro, Calm Mind Armarouge, and Calm Mind Reuniclus by negating the boosts they have attained. Rest is Alolan Muk's main form of recovery and, in longer-paced games, lets it continue to threaten opposing Pokemon. Sleep Talk makes Alolan Muk not too passive even while it's asleep, so it can continue threatening defensive cores. Leftovers allows Alolan Muk to keep itself healthy without relying on Rest as much, enabling it to be more proactive. Tera Water helps Alolan Muk against powerful Water-type special wallbreakers such as Volcanion and Basculegion-F. Tera Fairy can be used to give Alolan Muk a Fighting resistance to help against Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao while also being a solid defensive typing overall. Alolan Muk typically doesn't enjoy Terastallizing, however, as it loses the valuable neutralities and resistances its original typing comes with, so Terastallizing should be a last resort.</p> <p>Alolan Muk fits best on balance and stall teams, as it's able to utilize its immense special bulk to wall powerful Pokemon like Gengar and Armarouge while threatening solid damage and status. Blissey in particular pairs amazingly with Alolan Muk on stall, with Blissey walling the special wallbreakers that Alolan Muk cannot handle such as Choice Specs Volcanion and Tera Blast Ground Porygon-Z, while Alolan Muk in return can take on the Ghost-types that Blissey can struggle to hit such as Gengar and Basculegion-F. Physically defensive walls such as Hippowdon and Slowbro pair well with Alolan Muk, as they can cover the physical attackers that threaten it such as Galarian Zapdos and Gyarados. In return, Alolan Muk can take on the special attackers that threaten them such as Gengar and Volcanion. Flying-type Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Talonflame pair well with Alolan Muk, as they can easily switch into Ground-types such as Krookodile and Hippowdon, and Fighting-types that threaten Alolan Muk, such as Mienshao and Hisuian Lilligant, and in return, Alolan Muk can switch into the various Electric-types that threaten them such as Magnezone and Raikou, as well as powerful special attackers they cannot immediately threaten such as Volcanion. Entry hazard control options such as Cyclizar and Talonflame pair well with Alolan Muk, allowing it to leverage Leftovers recovery more often, while Alolan Muk can threaten Ghost-type spiblockers, such as Gengar and Basculegion-F, and Empoleon, which might try to punish Defog. Alolan Muk heavily appreciates Pokemon like Gastrodon, Noivern, and Slowbro that can help chip away at enemies health, as they can increase the damage that Alolan Muk does with moves such as Spikes or can help deny recovery with Taunt or Psychic Noise.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>A solid choice for both speed control and wallbreaking, Gengar is a dynamic option for teams, as it can provide immense upside due to its versatility and offensive prowess. Gengar is most often seen sporting a Choice Scarf, comfortably outpacing other Choice Scarf users in the metagame like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Galarian Zapdos. Nasty Plot Gengar is a fast, potent setup sweeper that can decimate teams after just one boost. Gengar, using status-spreading moves such as Thunder Wave, Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp and disruption moves in Encore and Taunt, can disrupt its primary checks like Cyclizar, Umbreon, and Registeel. Despite this tremendous upside, Gengar is incredibly frail and susceptible to getting OHKOed by much of the metagame, including notable checks like Bisharp, Cyclizar, and Alolan Muk, so getting it on the field can be difficult. Gengar also directly competes with other great Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier, such as Basculegion-F, Mimikyu, especially on more bulky team structures.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Toxic Spikes can provide great value for Hex Gengar. Destiny Bond is always a nice option to trade against something slower than Gengar, such as Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon, which can be otherwise tricky to take down. Knock Off gives Gengar its own item removal option, which can help on entry hazard-stacking teams at the cost of not being offensively threatening due to its low Attack. Pain Split is Gengar's only form of recovery, which it can use against foes like Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra well. Taunt similarly shuts down slower setup sweepers like Bisharp and can pair well with Destiny Bond to ensure it trades effectively. Choice Specs can be used to threaten OHKOs on Pokemon like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Jirachi.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Although Gengar can use Focus Blast to hit Dark-types like Bisharp and Krookodile for massive damage, it struggles to effectively take down either of them, as Sucker Punch from Bisharp threatens an immediate OHKO while Krookodile often uses Choice Scarf, outpacing and taking Gengar down with ease. Umbreon is susceptible to Encore and Trick as well as being used as setup fodder, but it can reliably tank attacks and threaten to take Gengar out with Foul Play. Alolan Muk, while more niche, can comfortably take hits from Gengar before KOing it with Knock Off, though it must be wary of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Non-Choice Scarf Gengar is outpaced and immediately threatened by a majority of the Choice Scarf users in the metagame, including Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, Galarian Zapdos, and even opposing Gengar. Similarly, Gengar is in a pretty comfortable Speed tier naturally, but it is still outsped by plenty of Pokemon that threaten to OHKO it with slight chip damage, such as Barraskewda, Maushold, and Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Cyclizar</strong>: Assault Vest Cyclizar is a common Gengar check and can disrupt it significantly, switching in and threatening big damage with Knock Off while also being able to pivot out into Ghost-type teammates on an expected Focus Blast.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Gengar is a potentially devastating setup sweeper thanks to its great Speed tier, outpacing base 100 Speed Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Jirachi, and Entei, and strong STAB combination. Focus Blast gives Gengar the coverage to hit bulky Steel-types like Bisharp, Hisuian Goodra, and Registeel and Gengar's primary check in Cyclizar for massive damage, though it comes at the cost of accuracy issues. Encore can be really disruptive to lock slower walls into unfavorable positions, such as forcing Suicune to use Calm Mind and Umbreon to use Wish, giving Gengar free setup opportunities. Air Balloon is quite powerful on Gengar, affording it safe entry and setup chances against Hippowdon and Quagsire as well as Choice-locked Krookodile if it locks into Earthquake. Colbur Berry similarly gives Gengar great defensive value, allowing it to comfortably survive Knock Off from Pokemon like Cyclizar, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos to threaten them back safely. Tera Ghost allows Shadow Ball to OHKO Jirachi after Spikes damage and Reuniclus, while Tera Fighting can be used to flip the weakness to Dark and boost the power of Focus Blast to annihilate Hisuian Goodra after taking Spikes damage and Assault Vest Cyclizar.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Gengar fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that can provide it entry points where it can set up and clean late-game. Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir pair well with Gengar, fulfilling the speed control role over Gengar to help against Cyclizar and Krookodile, and they grant it safe entry opportunities against their checks like Slowbro and Jirachi with U-turn and Healing Wish respectively. Defensive pivot support options like Cyclizar and Jirachi are key teammates; Cyclizar provides entry hazard and item removal to wear down Gengar's checks like Hisuian Goodra and Registeel, Jirachi can help enable Gengar by spreading paralysis and providing Wish passing, and they serve as Ghost- and Psychic-type switch-ins against Pokemon like Basculegion-F and Gardevoir, respectively. Hazard setters like Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Jirachi are valuable to accrue chip damage on the opposition, which improves Gengar's ability to clean; the first two also help to absorb Knock Off attempts from Cyclizar and Krookodile. Other offensive setup options like Bisharp, Flygon, and Terrakion can help enable Gengar to sweep late-game, as they can wallbreak effectively against its checks like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon early- to mid-game or can swap roles with Gengar and clean late-game themselves.</p>"
      },
      "Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hex takes advantage of status spread by Gengar and its teammates, notably Thunder Wave from users like Reuniclus and Slowbro, to bolster its damage to seemingly unwallable range. Sludge Bomb is used over Sludge Wave because of the increased odds to poison, which can similarly help to enable Hex damage. Dazzling Gleam gives Gengar a reliable attack for its most common check, Cyclizar, along with Krookodile and Umbreon. Will-O-Wisp is used to disrupt Cyclizar and offensive Pokemon like Bisharp and Maushold that may try to switch into Gengar and force it out. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Gengar hit the field more often to spread status and use its strong attacks. Leftovers can be run to similarly maintain health on Gengar, though it requires entry hazard removal support to maximize its effectiveness. Colbur Berry is a nice item for Gengar to have against the aforementioned Cyclizar and other Knock Off users like Galarian Zapdos, allowing it to comfortably survive an attack and ensure an attempt at burning and hindering the opposition. Tera Fairy can provide a boost to Dazzling Gleam and flips the weakness to Dark, which can allow Gengar to take down Dark-types, like Choice Scarf Krookodile, while also helping absorb strong Dragon-type attacks from threats like Hisuian Goodra and Noivern. Tera Dark similarly flips the weakness to Dark while providing a key immunity to Psychic, which is useful to help against the bulky Psychic-types that can stomach a hit like Jirachi and Reuniclus.</p> <p>Hex Gengar fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that aim to spread status to enable a late-game sweep for Gengar. Teammates that can help spread status, like Body Slam Jirachi, Thunder Wave Slowbro and Reuniclus, and Toxic Umbreon can help wear down Gengar checks like Hisuian Goodra and Registeel while also helping bolster the damage from Hex. Offensive partners that can also take advantage of this type of status spam are slower wallbreakers like Volcanion and Crawdaunt, which can outspeed a lot of threats after they are paralyzed to consistently dish out strong attacks. Defensive partners that can help absorb Knock Off and other Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from threats like Bisharp, Krookodile, and Basculegion-F—like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, and Umbreon—are important for Gengar, as they allow Gengar to fall back on them to wear down foes before threatening to sweep late-game. Leftovers Gengar also appreciates Cyclizar for its entry hazard removal abilities, with other teammates like Noivern and Talonflame offering similar hazard removal and pivot support. Gengar does struggle to break through some of the special walls in the tier, especially Hisuian Goodra, Registeel, and Umbreon, so hazard support from teammates like Chesnaught and Jirachi can go a long way. Physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mienshao also help Gengar break through Dark- and Steel-types like Bisharp and Umbreon.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Gengar is one of the fastest Pokemon in RU, leaving speed demons like Cyclizar and Barraskewda as well as Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Gardevoir in the dust. Ghost / Poison is an excellent offensive typing that can hit most of the metagame for at least neutral damage, only resisted by Krookodile, Bisharp, Overqwil, and Alolan Muk. Choice Scarf Gengar functions as a revenge killer against Pokemon without priority like Basculegion-F, Armarouge, and slower Choice Scarf users such as Jirachi and Krookodile. Trick gives Gengar a way to incapacitate setup sweepers like Gyarados and Suicune that it doesn't have the power to reliably OHKO and walls like Hisuian Goodra and Gastrodon that can easily switch into one of Gengar's attacks. Gengar can lean into its utility options, setting Toxic Spikes for more entry hazard-focused teams. Focus Blast allows Gengar to threaten Steel-types like Bisharp, Empoleon, and non-Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra. It can use Thunder Wave as speed control to allow a slower sweeper like Armarouge or Weakness Policy Basculegion-F to outspeed foes. Destiny Bond can be used as a last resort to stop sweepers or when Gengar is weakened and simply needs to trade one-for-one. Tera Ghost boosts Gengar's Shadow Ball and lets it function as a cleaner against teams that are chipped down, notably OHKOing physically defensive Slowbro and having a chance to OHKO maximum HP Jirachi after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, it removes Gengar's weaknesses to Ground and Psychic, allowing it to survive Psychic-type attacks from Reuniclus or Earthquake from Hippowdon. Tera Dark allows Gengar to live a Sucker Punch from even a +2 Bisharp and OHKO it with Focus Blast and turns Gengar's weaknesses to Psychic, Dark, and Ghost into resistances. This lets it switch into Choice-locked Psychic-type attacks from Gardevoir and Armarouge and the strong Psychic-type STAB attacks of Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Necrozma without worry. Tera Dark also allows Gengar to win the mirror match by resisting Shadow Ball and OHKOing back with its own Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Gengar can fit on a wide variety of team structures, from offense to balance, due to its ability to revenge kill, shut down walls like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon with Trick, use Toxic Spikes to spread hazards, and leverage Thunder Wave to slow down opposing revenge killers like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos. Gengar is a great addition to hazard stack teams with its ability to leverage hazard chip damage to meet damage thresholds like OHKOing Hisuian Goodra with Focus Blast after three layers of Spikes and shutting down Defog users like Talonflame with Trick. Teammates like Suicune and Armarouge love Gengar's ability to use Trick on special walls and give them its Choice Scarf, letting them set up for late-game sweeps. Cyclizar makes an excellent teammate for Gengar, as it is able to keep the field clear of hazards for it while pivoting into Gengar to absorb pesky Fighting- and Fairy-type moves that threaten the little bike lizard. Entei can threaten Pokemon like Bisharp and Mamoswine, switching into their priority attacks while threatening them back with Sacred Fire. It can also threaten the Steel-types that switch in when Gengar locks into Sludge Wave. Defensively, Gengar loves having a Dark-type that can resist the Dark-, Ghost-, and Psychic-type moves that threaten it, making Pokemon like Krookodile and Umbreon enticing choices. Krookodile can set up Stealth Rock for Gengar to take advantage of, while Umbreon can keep it healthy with Wish and cripple walls with Toxic. Knock Off absorbers like Rocky Helmet Chesnaught and Hippowdon can switch in to prevent Gengar from being heavily damaged and losing its item. Noivern can lure in Pokemon looking to hit it with a strong Moonblast, then U-turn into Gengar, which resists the move. It can also threaten their common checks, Steel-types, with Flamethrower.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey is a premier special wall in the tier. Its massive HP stat, coupled with good Special Defense and Eviolite, allows Chansey to reliably shrug off almost any special attack from foes such as Basculegion-F, Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra, and non-Iron Defense Magnezone. It also has good utility, with access to an entry hazard option in Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to cripple foes such as Empoleon, Gengar, and Noivern. Chansey is a staple in stall teams and decent in balance teams, as it fulfills the role of the special wall perfectly. Having access to Heal Bell and Healing Wish allows Chansey to further support its teammates by being a cleric and allowing a teammate to fully heal themselves, respectively. However, Chansey is extremely passive, as Seismic Toss is usually its only method of damaging the opponent, which can be countered by Ghost-types like Basculegion-F, Gengar, and Mimikyu, as well as give an easier time for setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Slowbro to set up. Moreover, due to its reliance on Eviolite, Chansey is prone to entry hazard stacking, making it susceptible to being worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Healing Wish is a good option on Chansey, as it can fully heal a weakened teammate and works best late-game. Protect is useful to scout for Choice-locked attacks from Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Gardevoir. Chansey can opt to run Calm Mind, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt to be a bulky setup sweeper; however, its damage output prior to Calm Mind boosts is low. Chansey can also choose to run Serene Grace to fish for Ice Beam freezes, but this is not a very reliable strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Gallade can switch into Chansey and threaten to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Crawdaunt, Maushold, Krookodile, and Golurk deal huge damage to Chansey, while Chansey cannot do much in return.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Chansey is severely crippled by Knock Off, as losing Eviolite severely hinders its bulk. As such, common Knock Off users such as Cyclizar, Krookodile, and Hisuian Goodra are threats to Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: Due to being very passive, Taunt completely shuts down Chansey, as it can only use Seismic Toss in return. Pokemon such as Noivern, Wo-Chien, Gyarados, and Volcanion commonly run Taunt, and Chansey has to be aware of them. Choice Scarf + Trick and Encore are also good against Chansey, as the former severely cripples Chansey while the latter gives the opposing team free turns.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers with access to recovery moves like Slowbro and Reuniclus can set up on Chansey. Moreover, threats that do not necessarily mind lowering their Speed via Thunder Wave such as Bisharp are also threatening against Chansey.</p>",

Soft-Boiled gives Chansey reliable recovery and makes it easier for Chansey to tank special attacks. Stealth Rock is a great move on Chansey, as it has a rather easy time setting up Stealth Rock against physically weak Pokemon like Empoleon, Vaporeon, and Hisuian Goodra. This helps specifically for stall teams, as one could opt to run Spikes instead of Stealth Rock on common stall staples like Quagsire. Heal Bell allows Chansey to cure any status ailments for the team, which is especially useful on balance and stall teams, as one of the key strategies in dealing with those archetypes is to whittle them down with Toxic and Paralysis. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to cripple opposing Pokemon like Gengar, Armarouge, and Noivern. Natural Cure allows Chansey to absorb status conditions and remove them upon switching out, adding to its high longevity. 56 HP EVs allow Chansey to be 3HKOed by a +1 Special Attack Psyshock from Armarouge. Tera Dark allows Chansey to wall Stored Power sweepers such as Cresselia and Armarouge, deal with Psyshock reliably from Gardevoir and the aforementioned Armarouge, and block Psychic Noise. Tera Ghost can flip Chansey's weakness to Fighting to an immunity, allowing Chansey to cripple Fighting-type threats like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao with Thunder Wave or damage them with Seismic Toss.</p> <p>Chansey is a staple on stall teams and so enjoys teaming up with other stall staples such as Quagsire, Chesnaught, and Slowbro. These Pokemon have good synergy with Chansey, as Quagsire and Slowbro are good switch-ins to Fighting-type threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao, since they are good absorbers of Knock Off and are good at neutralizing setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Suicune. Chesnaught and Quagsire also provide Spikes support, weakening the opposing team over time, while Slowbro is a bulky wincon for stall teams. Chansey acts as a good special wall that can help the team beat usual balance breakers such as Choice Specs Basculegion-F, Hisuian Goodra, and Volcanion. Talonflame is a good partner due to it also being a good Fighting-type switch-in and Defogger. Umbreon can pass Wish and deal with Ghost-types like Gengar and Basculegion-F that are immune to Chansey's Seismic Toss. Chansey also enjoys entry hazard control due to being limited to using Eviolite, so Cyclizar, Noivern, and the aforementioned Talonflame are good partners. Moreover, due to Chansey being prone to U-turn cores such as Galarian Zapdos and Flygon, it appreciates Pokemon that punish such cores, such as Flame Body Talonflame and Static Bellibolt.</p>"

The high power of Gyarados is excellent for breaking through opposing walls and the many opportunities it has to set up allow it to clean the remnants of opposing teams. Thanks to Terastallization, Gyarados finally has access to a reliable physical Flying-type move, and it uses it to great effect, threatening to sweep any team after a Dragon Dance. However, Tera Blast Gyarados is heavily reliant on Terrastalization, severely limiting its team's flexibility during both teambuilding and battle. The reliance of Terastallizing into the Flying-type also results in Gyarados remaining vulnerable to Electric-type foes. Even without Tera Blast, Gyarados suffers from a low Speed among its offensive peers, being outsped by Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos, and its lower physical bulk can leave it vulnerable to these Pokemon. Additionally, Gyarados without Taunt are susceptible to many forms of disruption and status.</p>",

Earthquake is used to deal super effective damage to bulky Steel-types like Empoleon and Hisuian Goodra, as well as being unresisted by Water-resistant foes in Amoonguss and Slowbro. Tera Blast Flying gives Gyarados access to a Flying-type STAB move that blows away Grass-types like Chesnaught and Amoonguss while managing to 2HKO Gastrodon and Reuniclus at +1 Attack. Tera Blast also does not make contact, preventing the effects of opposing Rocky Helmet users and Flame Body Talonflame. Ice Fang is a weaker option for Gyarados to hit Grass- and Dragon-types like Wo-Chien and Noivern that has the advantage of not requiring it to Terastallize. Taunt prevents opposing Slowbro and Reuniclus from paralyzing Gyarados with Thunder Wave, Terrastilized Talonflame from burning it with Will-O-Wisp, and Hippowdon phazing it out with Whirlwind, as well as preventing recovery from Slowbro and Chesnaught. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gyarados to ignore Stealth Rock, granting it more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance and greater longevity over the course of the game. Covert Cloak allows Gyarados to safely switch into and set up against Scald Slowbro and Suicune and provides protection against Jirachi's Body Slam. The combination of Covert Cloak and Taunt effectively provide Gyarados immunity to status effects, with the exception of status spreaders that outspeed it, like Gengar and Ribombee. Moxie allows Gyarados to continue to snowball after each KO, overwhelming the defensive Pokemon that would normally withstand its attacks. Intimidate allows it to set up against physical attackers like Krookodile and Mienshao more easily and provide some support for the rest of the team, though it activates Defiant and Competitive on opposing Bisharp, Galarian Zapdos, and Empoleon. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Basculegion-F at +1 Speed. Tera Ground is an alternative for sets that forgo Tera Blast, boosting the damage of Earthquake, flipping Gyarados's crippling Electric weakness into an immunity, and preventing Thunder Wave from Reuniclus and Slowbro.</p> <p>Gyarados can fit on any offense team, ranging from hyper offense to bulky offense, that can take advantage of its snowballing ability with Moxie or its defensive utility with Intimidate and its Ground immunity. Gyarados pairs well with other physical attackers like Bisharp, Krookodile, and Maushold because it is able to beat many of the physical walls in the tier to enable its partners; alternatively, they can cause enough damage to allow Gyarados to break through its own checks. On more balanced teams, U-turn users like Mienshao and Jirachi can pivot into Gyarados against such targets, granting easy opportunities to set up, particularly if running Taunt. If Gyarados chooses to forgo Heavy-Duty Boots, it enjoys the aid of entry hazard removal from the likes of Maushold and Cyclizar to preserve its HP. Due to its reliance on Terastallization, Tera Blast Gyarados prefers allies that are able to excel without Tera, like Gardevoir and Armarouge, that will allow Gyarados to use the mechanic itself and threaten physical walls like Slowbro and Registeel. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Krookodile and Chesnaught can further facilitate Gyarados's ability to clean a game, particularly with Moxie.</p>"

Ditto runs 248 HP to minimize Stealth Rock damage and allow it to use Struggle up to five times from full HP. A Quiet nature and 252 Special Attack EVs allow Ditto to maximize Future Sight Damage when transformed into Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus, as Future Sight damage is based on Ditto's Special Attack before transforming. A Choice Scarf lets Ditto outrun the Pokemon that it is transforming into without having to rely on a Speed tie. Tera Steel reduces Stealth Rock damage and is a good defensive Tera type, helping out specifically when transformed into Gardevoir and Hisuian Goodra. Ditto pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Hisuian Goodra, which can take hits directed at Ditto after it revenge kills or forces out the opposing Pokemon. Ditto also pairs well with passive Pokemon such as Empoleon, Chansey, and Chesnaught that may get set up on, which can allow Ditto to come in and revenge kill those setup sweepers. Ditto also benefits from strong entry hazard control from Pokemon like Cyclizar and Talonflame, which allows it to come in multiple times over the course of the game. Ditto has trouble when transforming into opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos, Gengar, and Gardevoir, due to having to rely on winning a Speed tie.

  "Zapdos-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Zapdos is a defining offensive threat in SV RU thanks to its excellent Attack stat and good Speed tier paired with a near-unresisted STAB combination and solid coverage in U-turn and Knock Off. As one of the few viable offensive Flying-types, Galarian Zapdos takes advantage of the tier's lack of reliable Pokemon that resist the combination of Flying- and Fighting-type attacks to shred through unprepared teams, with even those that prepare for the big bird needing to play carefully against it. Galarian Zapdos's power and pivoting capabilities let it enable several potent offensive threats, such as Bisharp, Nasty Plot Mew, and Magnezone, while also providing more balanced teams with reliable speed control by holding a Choice Scarf. However, Galarian Zapdos often relies on Choice items to either break through teams or outrun threats like non-Choice Scarf Gengar, making it relatively prediction-heavy. This forces Galarian Zapdos to pivot out more than it wants to or else be exploited by setup sweepers like Calm Mind Slowbro and Bisharp after locking itself into a move. Additionally, Galarian Zapdos relies heavily on Brave Bird and Close Combat to hit hard, reducing its health and bulk, respectively; this leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by priority users like Entei or, if not running a Choice Scarf, faster threats like Noivern. Galarian Zapdos struggles to break through physically bulky Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon without a Choice Band, while it gets outsped by threats like Raikou and Gengar if it forgoes a Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Galarian Zapdos can run Protective Pads to ease prediction while protecting it from Rocky Helmet or contact-based abilities like Talonflame's Flame Body. If Protective Pads are used, Taunt can provide additional utility by disrupting bulkier Pokemon like Gastrodon and Hippowdon. However, Galarian Zapdos will be forced to forgo U-turn or Knock Off, both of which provide valuable coverage and utility. A Bulk Up set can be used to let Galarian Zapdos sweep through teams; however, due to how long it takes for Galarian Zapdos to get going, it can be disrupted or revenge killed easily. Agility can be used to ease the latter issue, making Galarian Zapdos nigh-impossible to outspeed in the process, but this forces it to give up the valuable coverage of Knock Off or the utility of U-turn. If a non-Choice item set is used, Thunderous Kick can be run over Close Combat in order to let Galarian Zapdos stay in more often while letting it weaken defensive checks like Hippowdon and Cresselia, leaving them vulnerable to Brave Bird. A more defensive Tera type like Steel or Fire can be used at the cost of power; the former lets it resist Extreme Speed from Entei while the latter protects it from Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp and Flame Body. Acrobatics is a reliable, recoil-free alternative Flying-type STAB move to Brave Bird, but it relies on Galarian Zapdos running either a consumable item like Eject Pack or forgoing an item completely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types, such as Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Cresselia, can take most of Galarian Zapdos's attacks, heal off the damage, and retaliate with a super-effective move or cripple it with Thunder Wave. All of them do have to be wary of Knock Off, especially if Galarian Zapdos is running a Choice Band; however, they can all run Colbur Berry as a one-time shield against it. Armarouge is able to survive a non-Choice Band-boosted attack, boost its Speed with Weak Armor, and revenge kill Galarian Zapdos with its powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Quagsire, Gastrodon, and especially Hippowdon are major thorns in Galarian Zapdos's side, as all of them can take hits from it before retaliating with Toxic, Ice Beam, or Stone Edge, respectively. Additionally, all three tend to carry Rocky Helmet to punish pivoting attempts with U-turn. However, Choice Band variants are able to 2HKO Quagsire and Gastrodon. Gligar can take even Choice Band-boosted attacks but can't do much back directly and is vulnerable to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects</strong>: Galarian Zapdos's reliance on contact moves means that it can be quickly worn down by Rocky Helmet from the likes of Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Gastrodon, especially when combined with Brave Bird recoil. Additionally, Galarian Zapdos can find itself crippled by abilities that trigger on contact, namely Flame Body from Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers &amp; Priority</strong>: Because Galarian Zapdos tends to wear itself down with Brave Bird recoil, it is prone to being picked off by priority moves it does not resist, such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Extreme Speed from Entei or the more niche Lucario. Additionally, Pokemon that are naturally faster than Galarian Zapdos, such as Gengar and Terrakion, can revenge kill it, especially if they're running Choice Scarf themselves.</p>",

      "Choice Item Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Galarian Zapdos is a unique Fighting-type in the metagame because of its excellent offensive utility and good Speed tier. Knock Off is a staple for offensive Fighting-types to punish switches to Ghost- and Psychic-types like Armarouge, Gengar, Jirachi, Slowbro, and Reuniclus while doubling as item removal to rack up residual damage with entry hazard support. U-turn is an excellent pivot move, as it hits Psychic-types for super effective damage while giving teammates the opportunity to position onto the field safely into favorable matchups. Choice Scarf provides excellent Speed control, notably allowing Galarian Zapdos to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Krookodile. Choice Band gives Galarian Zapdos the breaking power to 2HKO would-be defensive checks like Gastrodon and Slowbro, which isn't possible using Choice Scarf without supplementing the damage output with Terastallization. Defiant is excellent for taking advantage of Defog attempts from Talonflame and Noivern and Intimidate from Krookodile. Tera Flying turns STAB Brave Bird into a practically unwallable attack and has the added benefit of removing weaknesses to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Reuniclus, Gardevoir, and Slowbro. Tera Dark provides similar defensive utility to Tera Flying, turning Flying-type attacks from super effective to neutral, which is helpful against Noivern and opposing Galarian Zapdos, while giving an immunity to Psychic and providing a STAB boost to Knock Off, allowing for an OHKO on Armarouge and a 2HKO on Reuniclus. Tera Steel flips the weaknesses to Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks into resistances, giving defensive utility into Choice Scarf Gardevoir and opposing Galarian Zapdos, and gives an immunity to Poison that helps against Gengar. Using Tera Steel allows Choice Band Galarian Zapdos to pick up valuable damage or KOs into Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Gengar.</p> <p>Choice Item Galarian Zapdos can function on balance and offense teams as either a fast attacker and pivot with Choice Scarf or a strong breaker with Choice Band. Defensive teammates that can pivot and give Galarian Zapdos safe entry points like Cyclizar, Empoleon, and Jirachi are crucial to maximizing the immediate damage output and offensive pressure that it puts on opponents. Pairing Choice Band Galarian Zapdos's potent breaking power with Pokemon that excel at late-game cleaning, like Bisharp, Maushold, and Mimikyu, can be advantageous. Empoleon and Jirachi are notable teammates for their ability to absorb Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Reuniclus, Gardevoir, and Slowbro and establish entry hazards. Offensive teammates like Basculegion-F and Gengar can threaten physical walls like Hippowdon, Jirachi, Slowbro, and Reuniclus and can form an offensive core that keeps momentum against otherwise strong defensive cores. Other teammates that can form a VoltTurn core with Galarian Zapdos like Barraskewda, Raikou, and Magnezone can put immense pressure on teams by forcing considerable chip damage with their strong pivot attacks. Capitalizing on this VoltTurn structure, Galarian Zapdos fits well on hazard stack archetypes, partnering with Chesnaught, Empoleon, Gligar, and Jirachi comfortably, as they provide defensive support and use its offensive pressure to wear down opponents. Galarian Zapdos lacks recovery and often takes a lot of recoil damage using Brave Bird, so Healing Wish and Wish support from teammates like Gardevoir, Jirachi, and Umbreon can improve its longevity and give it the staying power to consistently break through teams.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew distinguishes itself from other common Psychic-types like Slowbro and Cresselia by virtue of its incredibly deep movepool, which, when combined with its rounded statline, lets it run a variety of viable sets. Mew can take advantage of common utility and defensive Pokemon like Cyclizar, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, making progress against them with its many utility moves or using them as setup fodder while preparing for a sweep. Mew's access to Draining Kiss also makes Nasty Plot sets deceptively hard to take down, letting it consistently punch holes through teams. However, Mew's \"Master of None\" statline and lackluster typing, the latter of which gives it weaknesses to common attacks like Knock Off and U-turn, mean that it can find itself outdone by more specialized Pokemon. Due to its lack of recovery outside of Draining Kiss, Gastrodon and Chesnaught give it stiff competition as a Spikes setter, while other special sweepers like Gengar and Raikou have better offensive typings and stats. RU also has no shortage of Psychic-types that compete with Mew for a teamslot. Slowbro and Reuniclus have better bulk and reliable recovery, Armarouge is better at punching holes through teams with its powerful Fire-type STAB moves, and Jirachi has an identical statline to Mew while also having a better defensive typing and ability. While Mew's Speed tier is fairly solid, it's prone to being revenge killed by dangerous Pokemon like Gengar, Galarian Zapdos, and Noivern.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn can be run on support sets over Volt Switch to let Mew pivot out against Ground-types like Krookodile and Rhyperior, though its nature as a contact move can be exploited by Rocky Helmet users like Hippowdon as well as Talonflame thanks to Flame Body. Mew can act as a Stealth Rock setter on teams that can't afford to use any other hazard setters; however, it often finds itself outclassed by other dedicated Stealth Rock users, like Registeel, Hippowdon, Krookodile, and especially Jirachi. A dedicated lead set with Mental Herb and Taunt can be used to stop the opposing team from setting entry hazards while Mew sets up its own, though Terrakion and Lycanroc-D are usually better options for a dedicated lead due to their superior Speed stats. Mew can serve as a unique physical sweeper with Swords Dance or Dragon Dance combined with incredible coverage options like Flare Blitz, Close Combat, and Knock Off. However, Mew will often find itself worn down due to its lack of sustainability options, and other physical sweepers like Bisharp and Gyarados are much better at breaking through teams thanks to their STAB moves and types being stronger overall as well as their higher Attack stats. On Nasty Plot sets, Aura Sphere can be used to reliably OHKO Bisharp after minor chip damage, though its lacking power makes it inferior to Earth Power in most other situations, especially since it makes Mew unable to super effectively hit Jirachi or Armarouge. Mew can run a double dance set with Calm Mind, Iron Defense, Draining Kiss, and Stored Power, acting as a bulky setup sweeper that can prove difficult to take down, but it takes a while for Mew to get going, leaving it vulnerable to being disrupted or phazed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While they need to watch out for coverage moves like Draining Kiss or Body Press, Dark-types like Bisharp and Krookodile can offensively threaten Mew, forcing it out in the process. Wo-Chien can take even a boosted Draining Kiss while wearing down Mew with Knock Off, Ruination, and Leech Seed. Umbreon also takes just about anything Mew throws at it but must be careful of using Toxic due to Mew's Synchronize threatening to poison it as well.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar naturally outspeeds Mew and can threaten it with its powerful STAB moves, while Mimikyu can take a hit thanks to Disguise, threaten Mew with Shadow Claw, and pick it off with Shadow Sneak. Basculegion-F struggles to switch in to Nasty Plot sets, but can similarly threaten Mew with an Adaptability-boosted Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Mew often finds itself outpaced and picked off by faster threats, like Terrakion and Noivern, while Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile can threaten to revenge kill it. Similarly, strong priority, such as Entei's Extreme Speed and Lycanroc-D's Accelrock or Sucker Punch, can pick it off mid-sweep.</p> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: Mew's lack of initial power means that it can be stopped by Taunt from faster Pokemon like Noivern and Talonflame, as well as Encore from the likes of Jirachi and Maushold. Additionally, Nasty Plot sets can be phazed by Dragon Tail from Hisuian Goodra or Cyclizar if Mew does not Tera Fairy, while Whirlwind Hippowdon can reliably phaze it regardless of Tera. Trick users like Gardevoir and Gengar can also stop Mew in its tracks by giving it a Choice Scarf, preventing it from performing its role.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mew sets itself apart from other Spikes users, namely Gastrodon and Chesnaught, thanks to its good Speed stat and incredible utility movepool. Body Press is a solid coverage move that lets Mew invest in bulk while also targeting Cyclizar, one of the tier's most common hazard removers. It also hits the Dark- and Steel-types that attempt to switch into Mew, such as Krookodile, Hisuian Goodra, and Bisharp. Mew's remaining moveslots are incredibly flexible and can be tweaked to suit the needs of its team. Psychic Noise can prevent bulky Pokemon, like Hippowdon and Empoleon, from taking advantage of Mew's passivity. Knock Off forces progress by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Entei and Volcanion, letting Mew's Spikes accrue more chip damage. Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Pokemon like Slowbro and Gastrodon as well as to put attackers like Armarouge and Gardevoir on a timer. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical threats like Galarian Zapdos and Bisharp, preventing them from taking advantage of Mew. For the last slot, Volt Switch allows Mew to provide momentum and pivot out of unfavorable matchups, while Taunt can neuter defensive Pokemon like Umbreon and Cresselia. Rocky Helmet lets Mew wear down physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos and Jirachi, leaving them open to be picked off by Mew's teammates. 16 Speed EVs allow Mew to outrun maximum Speed Adamant Bisharp as well as Modest Volcanion. Tera Fighting bolsters the power of Body Press, letting Mew guarantee an OHKO on Cyclizar and Bisharp with it. It also gives Mew a resistance to Dark-type attacks, preventing the aforementioned Bisharp from KOing it with Sucker Punch as well as letting it take on Krookodile. Tera Ghost provides an immunity to Cyclizar's Rapid Spin, preventing it from removing entry hazards against Mew. Both Tera types also provide a valuable resistance to U-turn.</p> <p>Mew gives offense and bulky offense an excellent Spikes setter and utility Pokemon, wearing down the opposing team with Spikes while providing pivoting and/or status spreading capabilities. Mew is vulnerable to opposing entry hazards, especially since opposing hazard setters can take advantage of its passivity to get their own hazards up against non-Taunt variants; faster hazard setters like Jirachi can especially pose a problem due to Mew being unable to Taunt them first. As such, Cyclizar makes for a great partner due to its ability to remove them with Rapid Spin while maintaining Spikes on the opposing side. Cyclizar is also able to check Gengar and Basculegion-F in addition to removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the opposing team with Knock Off, giving more opportunities for Mew to wear down the opposing team. Offensive Pokemon, including setup sweepers like Suicune and Bisharp as well as wallbreakers like Volcanion and Mamoswine, appreciate the chip damage provided by Mew's Spikes wearing down their defensive checks. They also appreciate Mew being able to cripple the opposing team with Psychic Noise, Taunt, and/or status, and its ability to create safe switch-in opportunities with Volt Switch, in addition to Knock Off variants being able to remove Leftovers from the likes of Registeel and Hisuian Goodra. Specially bulky Pokemon, like Hisuian Goodra, Umbreon, and Empoleon, make for great partners with Mew, helping check powerful special attackers like Basculegion and Armarouge. Umbreon in particular makes for a potent defensive combination with Mew thanks to Toxic; when combined with Mew's spikes, this lets the duo wear down the opposing team efficiently. Mew's vulnerability to Dark-types like Krookodile as well as its weakness to U-turn makes Fighting-types, like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Hisuian Lilligant, excellent partners for it. In return, Mew aids in their ability to break through the opposing team through the entry hazards it sets as well as its ability to disrupt common defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Slowbro, in addition to forming potent VoltTurn cores with the former two.</p>"

Feraligatr also has solid coverage, letting it heavily damage Water-resistant targets like Volcanion and Slowbro with Crunch or Noivern with Ice Punch. However, Feraligatr's average bulk and awkward Speed tier makes it easy to wear down, and even after a boost from Dragon Dance, it's easily outpaced by other boosted threats like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir; it does not help that it often has to pick between hitting hard with Liquidation or picking off faster threats with Aqua Jet. These traits mean that Feraligatr fits exclusively on more offensive structures, with bulkier teams typically preferring Gyarados due to its better bulk and access to Intimidate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trailblaze lets Feraligatr OHKO Quagsire and specially defensive Gastrodon, two Water-immune Pokemon that otherwise check it; however, Feraligatr does not get the Speed boost due to Sheer Force, and it's somewhat weak otherwise. Lum Berry gives Feraligatr a one-time shield against burn and paralysis from the likes of Talonflame and Jirachi, respectively; however, it significantly reduces its damage output, preventing it from scoring key OHKOs and 2HKOs against the likes of Slowbro and Cresselia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon like Suicune, Slowbro, and Umbreon can take at least one boosted hit before threatening Feraligatr with status or, in the case of the latter, Foul Play. All three must be wary of Tera Dark, however; the former two take heavy damage from a boosted Crunch, while Feraligatr is guaranteed to survive a Foul Play from the latter.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Fast Electric-types like Raikou can take a boosted Aqua Jet before retaliating with a super effective STAB move. If Feraligatr lacks Liquidation, slower Electric-types, such as Magnezone, can take at least one hit before threatening an OHKO back.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir can outspeed Feraligatr even after a Speed boost from Dragon Dance to revenge kill it; however, both must be wary of Aqua Jet variants. Additionally, faster priority users like Entei and Mimikyu can revenge kill Aqua Jet variants with Extreme Speed and Shadow Sneak, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Talonflame can outspeed Feraligatr to burn it with Will-O-Wisp or punish it with Flame Body.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Feraligatr can be a terrifying setup sweeper, either muscling through teams with Swords Dance or shoring up its lacking Speed with Dragon Dance. The STAB move of choice depends on what boosting move it opts to run. If Swords Dance is used, then Aqua Jet is preferred due to its status as a priority move, letting it pick off faster threats like Galarian Zapdos and Gengar. On Dragon Dance sets, Liquidation is preferred due to its higher, Sheer Force-augmented power. Ice Punch targets Grass- and Dragon-types that otherwise resist Feraligatr's STAB attacks, such as Chesnaught and Cyclizar, respectively, while Crunch dispatches the likes of Slowbro and Reuniclus. A Jolly nature lets it outrun unboosted Armarouge as well as Cyclizar at +1, while an Adamant nature lets it OHKO Gastrodon after Stealth Rock chip with Liquidation after one Swords Dance. Tera Dark gives Feraligatr the ability to break through Hisuian Goodra and Suicune; at +2 Attack, it guarantees an OHKO on the former and has a significant chance to do so after Stealth Rock damage for the latter. Tera Water further bolsters the power of its STAB attacks, notably letting it 2HKO Chesnaught with a +2 Liquidation. Tera Water also gives it a significant chance to OHKO Gengar with Aqua Jet after hazard damage.</p> <p>Feraligatr makes its home on offensive teams. Other physical attackers such as Maushold and Mamoswine pair nicely with Feraligatr, as they can wear down and eventually break shared checks like Gastrodon and Slowbro. Mamoswine in particular is able to remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Chesnaught with Knock Off, giving Feraligatr some more longevity. Hazard support from the likes of Klefki and Terrakion further pressures checks like Suicune, with chip damage from Spikes and Stealth Rock letting it be OHKOed by a boosted Crunch. On bulky offense teams, Gardevoir makes for a great partner with Feraligatr by breaking through physical walls such as Chesnaught for it, tricking Choice Scarf onto checks like Registeel, and giving it a second chance to break with Healing Wish. In exchange, Feraligatr can pick off faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar with Aqua Jet and threaten Pokemon like Jirachi with Crunch. Jirachi itself makes for a great partner, as it can set Stealth Rock and spread paralysis with Body Slam, making Feraligatr's awkward Speed tier less of an issue. If not running Aqua Jet, powerful priority users like Bisharp and Entei can pick off faster threats so that Feraligatr can have an easier time sweeping. Ribombee is another excellent speed-controlling partner thanks to its access to Sticky Web and Stun Spore, making it easier for Feraligatr to sweep through more offensive structures.</p>"

Quagsire uses Pokemon such as Bisharp and Mimikyu as opportunities to heal off chip damage or establish Spikes, while Toxic allows Quagsire to help hinder pesky foes immune to Earthquake like Noivern and Talonflame. Quagsire's main issue is that it fears most special attackers, as due to its poor special bulk, it is obliterated by Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, Ribombee, and Armarouge. Quagsire also immensely struggles with Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant and Amoonguss, as they can not only take its Earthquake but also hit it for 4x super effective damage. Grass-type coverage such as Wood Hammer from Mimikyu or Grass Knot from Jirachi can also OHKO Quagsire unexpectedly. Quagsire is also unable to effectively take on Pokemon such as Suicune with Unaware sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes can be used over Spikes in order to further spread poison by threatening Pokemon such as Suicune and Raikou that Quagsire does not want to directly switch into. Encore can be used to lock opposing Pokemon into status moves such as Roost and Recover, which can help Quagsire to spread Toxic, although it is prediction reliant because of Quagsire's low Speed. Whirlpool can be used to trap opposing Pokemon while dealing chip damage, allowing Quagsire to beat foes such as Tera Steel Flygon and Rotom-H it might otherwise not be able to touch. Stealth Rock can be used if there aren't any other Stealth Rock setters on the team. Body Press is an option on Quagsire to hit Bisharp a lot harder while also hitting Tera Steel Levitate Pokemon such as Flygon and Rotom-H it would otherwise struggle with. Counter can be used to surprise foes such as Galarian Zapdos and Mamoswine that think they can chip down Quagsire with their strong moves, dealing massive damage back to them. Rocky Helmet is an option on Quagsire in order to deal chip damage to Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Maushold that it might otherwise be overwhelmed by. Water Absorb can be used over Unaware to help with matchups against Water-types such as Barraskewda and Suicune.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Quagsire's low special bulk, wallbreakers like Gardevoir, Hisuian Goodra, and Volcanion threaten it immensely.

Umbreon is most often utilized in Wish passing to some of the tier's best Choice item wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos, Hisuian Goodra, and Basculegion-F. Similarly, Umbreon can prop up balance and bulky offense structures by comfortably tanking attacks from special wallbreakers like Basculegion-F and Gengar and spreading status while maintaining its own health with Moonlight and Wish. Umbreon is efficient in neutralizing setup sweepers because of its natural bulk and ability to use their strength against them with Foul Play. Umbreon is, however, severely allergic to Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, which are commonplace in a metagame with strong threats that can force it out like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Terrakion. Using Terastallization on Umbreon grants it several key benefits, notably Tera Poison to flip the weaknesses to Bug and Fighting and become immune to poison. This, however, is not enough to help it break through important checks to Umbreon like Krookodile, Hisuian Goodra, and Registeel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Umbreon can use Thunder Wave over Toxic on teams that use slower wallbreakers like Golurk and Crawdaunt, allowing them to outspeed the opposition. Roar provides an option to phaze opposing setup sweepers like Tera Poison Slowbro and Calm Mind Suicune, while Taunt is another option that can prevent setup attempts.

Toxic helps Umbreon be less passive, threatening to secure a big poison on difficult-to-take-down Pokemon such as Slowbro and Wo-Chien. Protect is a valuable move on Umbreon to scout for Choice-locked attacks from wallbreakers like Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos while also allowing for a Wish to land safely and gaining a turn of Leftovers recovery; alternatively, Moonlight can provide more immediate healing in a similar vein. Inner Focus prevents Umbreon from getting flinched down by faster Pokemon like Bisharp and Jirachi, while Synchronize can allow Umbreon to act as a status absorber while returning the favor to Pokemon like Body Slam Jirachi and Thunder Wave Reuniclus. Leftovers is the preferred item for Umbreon to maximize its longevity, though Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to prevent entry hazard chip from accruing too quickly as well. Tera Poison flips weaknesses to Bug, Fairy, and Fighting, which is important to survive the onslaught of attacks from wallbreakers like Mienshao, Gardevoir, and Galarian Zapdos, while also providing a key immunity to poison. Similarly, Tera Ghost can provide an immunity to Fighting and Normal, notably letting Umbreon punish Maushold with Foul Play; it can also help Umbreon function as a spinblocker against Cyclizar.</p> <p>Umbreon is an excellent fit on balance and bulky offense structures, fulfilling many key roles such as Wish passing and status spreading. Using its defensive prowess to provide reliable recovery to Choice item wallbreakers like Basculegion-F, Hisuian Goodra, and Galarian Zapdos is a defining trait of Umbreon's, as it can be difficult for teams to survive the onslaught of strong attacks while also trying to break through Umbreon. Another notable partner for Umbreon is Armarouge, which can switch in against the physical Bug- and Fighting-type attacks thrown at Umbreon from the likes of Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos to activate Weak Armor to become an immediate threat. Slowbro pairs well with Umbreon defensively, as they can be quite difficult to break through using their immense bulk and type combination of Dark and Psychic. Given that Toxic is Umbreon's most notable way of dealing out damage, poison absorbers like Gligar and Registeel can reliably switch into Umbreon, so teammates like Barraskewda and Basculegion-F are important to threaten these checks. Entry hazard removal is important for Umbreon, as it often opts for Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots, making Noivern and Talonflame two great partners that can provide hazard removal. These two also resist Bug and Fighting, which helps to form dynamic defensive cores that can use Umbreon's access to Toxic to wear down the opposition. Other defensive partners like Gligar and Hisuian Goodra, which lack reliable recovery of their own, can use Wish pass support from Umbreon to improve their longevity.</p>"

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress is generally outclassed by the majority of Pokemon in the tier, though it can leverage its great physical bulk and diverse movepool to carve out a niche on certain team structures. It is incredibly flexible as an entry hazard setter, capable of running Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes as needed for its team, sometimes using several of these on the same set. With access to Volt Switch, Forretress functions nicely as a slow pivot for teams relying on wallbreakers that can struggle to hit the field consistently, providing safe entry points for teammates like Gengar and Volcanion. While Forretress is a capable spinner for teams that want reliable hazard removal, it competes with a staple Pokemon, Cyclizar, which is one of the few Pokemon that can offer more utility than it. However, Forretress can compress both the removal and setter roles into one teamslot, freeing up its teammates at the cost of being a generally inferior Pokemon. This role compression has allowed Forretress to find usage on weather teams and offensive structures that want to stack as many hazards as possible to enable their offensive pieces, notably Basculegion-F, to clean games consistently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Forretress has access to Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes, and it can use any combination of them depending on the needs of the team it is on. Rapid Spin allows it to remove entry hazards from its side. Thunder Wave can be used to enable paralysis-spam structures and slow down foes to free up teammates like Crawdaunt and Gallade. Counter and Earthquake are both niche picks capable of picking up surprise KOs on threats like Bisharp and Lucario. Eject Button lets Forretress use its bulk to tank an attack and get a teammate on the field safely, which can be vital on weather teams that want to maximize their turns. Red Card can phaze setup sweepers like Bisharp, Mew, and Mimikyu. Iron Defense can be used to form strong IronPress sets, though such sets struggle to beat common checks like Noivern and Slowbro and lack recovery outside of Rest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: While Forretress is capable of sponging physical attacks, it struggles to take any special attack thrown its way, even struggling to wall Gardevoir despite resisting its STAB moves.

Talonflame does not often run Fire-type attacks, but Rapid Spin can activate its Flame Body, and Talonflame can use Defog against Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: While Forretress can use its slowness to its advantage at times, it can also be a big hindrance. Encore users like Jirachi and Maushold can lock it into an unviable position, using it as setup fodder.

Rain is a notable archetype for Forretress, as it can allow teams to use multiple Swift Swim users consistently, such as Barraskewda, Basculegion-F, and Overqwil, without needing to worry as much about how to switch between them in-game. Sun teams use Forretress in a similar capacity, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant, Scovillain, and Venusaur to more efficiently pair up. Hyper offense teams can pair Forretress with a Ghost-type partner, such as Gengar and Basculegion-F, to spinblock and prompt a Knock Off from Cyclizar; Armarouge can then take Cyclizar's weaker Knock Off to activate both Weak Armor and Weakness Policy, hitting the field relatively safely while securing multiple boosts and immediately threatening to clean games.

    "overview": "<p>Gligar brings a unique set of defensive and support utility that gives it a valuable niche in offensive teams. It has a great defensive profile thanks to its solid Eviolite-boosted bulk, its immunity to Earthquake and Volt Switch, and the absence of viable Ice-type Pokemon in the tier. These properties make Gligar a great switch-in to many common wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion. Gligar's defensive profile coupled with its access to Toxic and its own immunity to poison thanks to its Immunity ability lets it safely switch into and threaten many of RU's walls such as Hippowdon, Umbreon, and Jirachi. From there, Gligar can proceed to lay down any entry hazard and grab momentum back through U-turn to give safe entry points to its team's wallbreakers. However, Gligar suffers from low special bulk even with Eviolite, meaning that special attackers such as Gardevoir, Gengar, and Empoleon can easily overwhelm it. Gligar's overreliance on Eviolite to handle strong attackers can be taken advantage of by threats Gligar would want to check, such as Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao, that carry Knock Off. This is further exacerbated by Gligar not having access to a recovery move, meaning that it can only take a limited amount of hits before getting KOed. Gligar's low Attack stat and absence of anti-setup tools like phazing means it cannot prevent many of the setup sweepers strong against the offense archetypes Gligar wants to support, such as Gyarados and Mimikyu, from getting out of hand by itself.</p>",

However, if no Stealth Rock setter can find its place in Gligar's team, then Gligar can also set Stealth Rock itself. Toxic partially fixes Gligar's passivity by crippling a wide variety of walls and attackers alike, such as Slowbro, Umbreon, Talonflame, and Galarian Zapdos. U-turn lets Gligar act as a slow pivot to give safe entry points to its teammates. Knock Off can be used to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive Pokemon from the likes of Noivern, Slowbro, and Jirachi and Choice Scarf from offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Gardevoir for Gligar's offensive teammates to have an easier time pressuring the enemy team.

Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra in particular is a great wallbreaker to pair Gligar with, being able to take on the special attacks targeted at Gligar thanks to its massive special bulk. Offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Terrakion, Azelf, and Krookodile appreciate the safe entry points Gligar provides and allow it to run Spikes. Volt Switch attackers such as Kilowattrel, Magnezone, and Raikou can form a VoltTurn core with Gligar and threaten Water-type Pokemon targeting Gligar such as Slowbro, Volcanion, and Suicune, while Gligar provides a Ground immunity for the latter two. Assault Vest Cyclizar can switch into the special attacks targeted at Gligar, clear hazards, and forms a pivoting core with Gligar. Jirachi can similarly switch into resisted special attacks, set Stealth Rock, and pivot with U-turn. Because Gligar struggles against setup sweepers, teammates able to combat them such as Roar Empoleon, Bisharp, and Mimikyu are important to have. Since Gligar hates losing its Eviolite, Knock Off absorbers such as Terrakion, Galarian Zapdos, and Slowbro are appreciated. It is possible to run Gligar in more balanced builds if paired with a Wish passer such as Jirachi, Umbreon, or Vaporeon to make up for its lack of recovery.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Calm Mind, in conjunction with Pressure, allows Raikou to become an excellent setup sweeper that can hit hard immediately while also handling opposing Calm Mind threats like Reuniclus and Suicune. Scald lets Raikou take on Ground-types like Krookodile, Mamoswine, and Rhyperior, as well as punish walls like Cyclizar and Umbreon with the chance to burn. Aura Sphere can be used to hit Normal- and Steel-types like Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra; Substitute is an alternative that grants Raikou safety from status while setting up, protection from moves like Knock Off and Dragon Tail, and allows it to PP stall foes like Suicune with Pressure and Calm Mind. Leftovers allows Raikou to maintain health while attempting to setup and sweep, while Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead to mitigate entry hazard chip damage. Tera Water removes the weakness to Ground and boosts the damage of Scald, which helps Raikou OHKO foes like Krookodile and Mamoswine, as well as OHKO Hippowdon at +1. Tera Dark can be used on Substitute sets to prevent Psychic Noise Reuniclus and Slowbro from disrupting Raikou while it sets up.</p> <p>Calm Mind Raikou fits well on balance and bulky offense teams, using its great Speed and coverage moves to rack up boosts and threaten to sweep late-game. Status spreaders like Talonflame and Umbreon are excellent teammates for Raikou; Talonflmae can use Will-O-Wisp to burn physical attackers like Bisharp, as well as check foes like Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos, while Umbreon can use Toxic to wear down foes like Cresselia and opposing Umbreon. Stealth Rock setters like Krookodile and Rhyperior can help break through Raikou's checks, like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, as can wallbreaker teammates like Basculegion-F and Mienshao, which also offer pivot support. Gastrodon is a notable Raikou counter, being immune to Thunderbolt and using Storm Drain to absorb Raikou's Scald, so teammates like Amoonguss and Breloom that can threaten it are much appreciated. Cresselia and Gardevoir are great teammates as well, offering to restore its HP with Lunar Dance and Healing Wish, respectively, to give Raikou a second chance at a setup sweep.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Entei acts as one of RU's deadliest wallbreakers, boasting a high Attack stat and an incredible STAB move in Sacred Fire. Sacred Fire's 50% burn chance lets Entei wear down even physically bulky checks, like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, as well as deter physically offensive Pokemon like Gyarados and Krookodile from switching in. Entei also has access to the coveted Extreme Speed, letting it revenge kill dangerous attackers like Galarian Zapdos and Armarouge. Additionally, its surprisingly solid bulk allows Entei to momentarily check the likes of Jirachi and Bisharp, allowing it to take a hit before eliminating them with Sacred Fire. However, Entei has middling and unreliable coverage, making it struggle against bulky Water-types like Suicune and Slowbro as well as Ground-types like Hippowdon and Rhyperior if they do not mind getting burned. Entei is also highly vulnerable to entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock; this forces it to choose between being able to switch in reliably with Heavy-Duty Boots or punching holes through teams with Choice Band. Entei's otherwise-solid Speed tier is rather crowded, causing it to Speed tie with threats like Galarian Zapdos, Mew, and Flygon. Additionally, Entei is outsped by dangerous threats like Noivern and Gengar; the former can take even an Extreme Speed boosted by both Tera Normal and Choice Band and resists Sacred Fire, while the latter is flat-out immune to Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swagger set with Mirror Herb is an option to let Entei act as a setup sweeper, giving it immense power without locking it into a move like Choice Band. However, Swagger's lackluster accuracy and Entei's vulnerability to being phazed by Pokemon like Hippowdon make it unreliable. Entei can utilize its surprisingly high Special Attack to run a set with Calm Mind, Protect, Substitute, and Lava Plume with Leftovers and Pressure, letting it PP stall foes while accruing boosts, though Entei's Stealth Rock weakness makes it rather inconsistent. Trailblaze can be used to get solid damage on Water- and Ground-types, like Gastrodon and Quagsire, in addition to letting it outrun threats like Gengar and Choice Scarf Gardevoir after one use. However, its low power makes it a poor coverage option outside of these situations. Tera Blast Grass is much stronger than Trailblaze, letting it take on the aforementioned Water- and Ground-types in addition to the likes of Hippowdon and Slowbro, though its reliance on Terastallization heavily reduces the flexibility of its team. Stomping Tantrum can be used over Stone Edge as a reliable coverage option against opposing Fire-types, like Volcanion and opposing Entei, as well as to dent Empoleon and Terrakion, though its lacking power compared to Stone Edge makes it less than ideal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Because of Entei's lack of coverage against them, bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Suicune can stop Entei in its tracks and heavily dent it with their STAB moves. Offensive Water-types like Feraligatr, Gyarados, and Volcanion are capable of threatening Entei as well. All of them struggle to switch in to its moves, however: Feraligatr and Gyarados hate being burned by Sacred Fire, while the latter and Volcanion must be wary of Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Gligar are all capable of taking hits from Entei before threatening it out with Earthquake. However, none of them enjoy being burned by Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Bulky Fire-types like Talonflame, Armarouge, and Rotom-H can take Sacred Fire and wear it down with their secondary STAB moves, especially if Entei is Choice-locked into it. All of them must be wary of Stone Edge, however, and Armarouge's Weak Armor leaves it prone to being revenge killed by Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entei's pure Fire typing leaves it vulnerable to every entry hazard in the game, especially Stealth Rock. While Entei can run Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate them, it is vulnerable to having them removed by Knock Off from Cyclizar or Hisuian Goodra as well as Trick from Gardevoir or Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Naturally faster Pokemon that can take an Extreme Speed, like Noivern, Terrakion, and Gengar, can KO Entei before it has a chance to act, especially if it has already been worn down. Additionally, Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Basculegion-F can take an Extreme Speed while being able to get the jump on Entei.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Entei is a phenomenal wallbreaker that can eviscerate common Pokemon like Bisharp, Jirachi, and Registeel. Extreme Speed is used to help Entei pick off faster Pokemon, such as weakened Noivern, Cyclizar, and Choice Scarf Krookodile. It's especially useful against more offensive teams, being able to revenge kill foes likeArmarouge, Gyarados, and Barraskewda after some chip damage. Stone Edge hits targets such as Volcanion, Armarouge, and Salamence. Crunch is used to target Slowbro, which would otherwise come in comfortably. Double-Edge can be substituted for Crunch, granting Entei the opportunity to hit foes that resist its Fire-type STAB moves like Gastrodon, Suicune, and Cyclizar harder. Choice Band is usually preferred, as it gives Entei the opportunity to OHKO foes like Noivern with Stone Edge. Heavy-Duty Boots is good for teams that lack entry hazard removal, in exchange for being weaker than Choice Band. On Choice Band sets, Tera Normal boosts Extreme Speed to secure a 2HKO on faster foes like Noivern. Tera Normal also provides decent defensive utility, providing an immunity to Ghost-type STAB moves from the likes of Gengar and Mimikyu. Tera Normal grants Entei the opportunity to 2HKO targets such as Slowbro and Suicune, which would otherwise come in comfortably on Entei, with Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge. Tera Dark can also be used to further boost the power of Choice Band Entei's Crunch, being able to cleanly 2HKO maximum Defense Slowbro while also being able to OHKO Basculegion-F and Armarouge.</p> <p>Entei is an excellent fit on balance and bulky offense teams, as they appreciate its ability to dispatch common threats, spread burns, and provide strong priority. Pokemon such as Krookodile and Bisharp appreciate Entei's ability to directly threaten bulky Pokemon such as Chesnaught and Registeel, in addition to possibly crippling Hippowdon and Rhyperior with burn from Sacred Fire. This opens up teammates such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Bisharp to sweep. In return, Krookodile sets Stealth Rock and utilizes Knock Off to help wear down Pokemon that like to come in on Entei, such as Slowbro, while Bisharp directly threatens Slowbro and can blow holes in the opposing team to allow Entei a clean sweep late-game. Bisharp has the ability to threaten faster Pokemon that Entei is vulnerable to like Gengar with its Sucker Punch. Special attackers like Gardevoir and Basculeigon-F pair well with Entei, as it can deal significant damage to their checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Choice Band Entei can struggle to get in if Stealth Rock is up, so it appreciates hazard removal from Pokemon such as Cyclizar and Noivern. In addition to this, Cyclizar brings Entei in safely against Pokemon that like to come in on it, such as Mamoswine and Chesnaught, which Entei takes advantage of. Entei also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Jirachi and Chesnaught. This helps weaken checks such as Slowbro and Hippowdon and weakens other Pokemon to be picked off with Extreme Speed. Jirachi also provides U-turn, which allows Entei to come in safely against foes such as Registeel.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is one of the prominent wincons of the tier. With a great defensive typing in Water and a high base HP stat, Suicune can set up on most bulky Pokemon in the tier. After one Calm Mind, Suicune is tough to revenge kill, as it deters physical attackers from switching in due to a potential burn from Scald, and special attackers have to break past the Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind. Pressure is an excellent ability on Suicune, as it allows Suicune to PP stall opposing Pokemon. Suicune's reliance on Leftovers leaves it vulnerable to Knock Off users, especially Cyclizar, as it is crippled for the rest of the game upon losing its Leftovers. Despite having a solid base Speed stat of 85, it is still slower than some common threats such as Mimikyu, Jirachi, and Cyclizar. Faster Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Gengar can exploit Suicune's lower Speed and hinder its progress-making or sweeping opportunities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Suicune can opt to run RestTalk, giving it a mode of reliable recovery. However, due to the unreliable nature of Sleep Talk, Suicune can be beaten by offensive Pokemon if it fails to get the correct move. Roar is also an option for it to phaze setup sweepers such as Slowbro, opposing Suicune, and Cresselia as well as rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent's side. A more offensive Calm Mind set with Scald, Ice Beam, and Shadow Ball or Tera Blast Electric can be used to threaten the opponent offensively. Tera Blast Electric hits Volcanion, Vaporeon, and Slowbro super effectively, making this set a good lure against common Suicune checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Suicune is permanently crippled by Knock Off, as Leftovers is its only source of recovery. Therefore, common Knock Off users like Cyclizar, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos are threats.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Suicune's ability to be a wincon is diminished upon getting burned or poisoned. Suicune should not switch into Gengar and Talonflame because it dislikes getting hit by Will-O-Wisp, which would counteract Leftovers's recovery. Paralysis also cripples Suicune to a lesser extent, as it will be more prone to slower Pokemon such as Magnezone and Taunt Volcanion.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Magnezone, Nasty Plot Rotom-C, and Choice Specs Gengar do great damage to Suicune, making it unable to set up reliably.</p> <p><strong>Sound-based Moves</strong>: Psychic Noise can deny Leftovers recovery for Suicune from like Reuniclus and Slowbro, and they can outlive Suicune due to having reliable recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set focuses on Suicune being a wincon by making use of Pressure and its HP and Speed stats. Substitute + Calm Mind ensures Suicune can set up on bulky but offensively weak Pokemon such as Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien. Protect is excellent for scouting moves on Choice-locked Pokemon, such Galarian Zapdos, Gardevoir, and Magnezone, as well as burning foe's PP with Pressure. Protect also gives Suicune one more turn of Leftovers recovery, which improves its longevity. Ice Beam can be used over Protect to hit Pokemon that are immune to Scald, such as Storm Drain Gastrodon, Volcanion, and Vaporeon, as well as deal super effective damage to Cyclizar. Due to Pressure and Calm Mind, Suicune can beat Pokemon that are unable to boost their offenses, like the aforementioned Water-immune foes and Empoleon, by PP stalling them. Shadow Ball is also a good option to hit Psychic-types like Jirachi, Slowbro, and Gardevoir, making them less of a threat. A maximum Speed stat is required for Suicune to outspeed key threats such as Gallade and Feraligatr, dealing decent damage to and potentially burning them. Tera Dark is the premier choice for Suicune, as it is immune to Psychic Noise upon Terastallizing. Tera Fairy is also an option, as it is a solid defensive type that resists Close Combat and U-turn from Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos. 252 HP EVs ensure Suicune has 101 HP Substitutes, meaning Seismic Toss from Chansey will not be able to break the Substitute.</p> <p>Suicune appreciates entry hazard removal due to running Leftovers, which is its only form of recovery, to minimize chip damage as much as possible. Therefore, hazard control from Cyclizar, Talonflame, and Noivern is much appreciated. Knock Off absorbers such as Chesnaught and Amoonguss are good partners, since they can switch into common Knock Off users like Krookodile and Mienshao safely. Suicune is also threatened by strong Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Magnezone and Hisuian Lilligant, so it appreciates the support from bulky Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra, and Reuniclus. Toxic users such as Umbreon, Amoonguss, and Quagsire are useful, as they put the checks Suicune usually has, like Cresselia, on a timer. Finally, strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Gengar, Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra, and Magnezone can get rid of opposing Calm Mind sweepers like Psychic Noise Slowbro and Reuniclus.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Swampert distinguishes itself from other bulky Water-types thanks to the combination of its wide utility movepool and Ground typing that leaves it with only one weakness, letting it compress roles for offensive teams. Additionally, its solid bulk lets it function as a blanket check to physical threats like Bisharp and Mamoswine. However, Swampert's lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to getting worn down by the Pokemon it's supposed to check; it can also be whittled down by fellow utility Pokemon like Umbreon and Chesnaught. Additionally, Swampert struggles to handle strong Flying- and Grass-types like Noivern and Hisuian Lilligant, respectively. At most, Swampert can only remove their items with Knock Off before being threatened out by their powerful attacks that target its lower Special Defense and its 4x Grass weakness, respectively. Swampert also competes with the tier's many bulky Water-types for a teamslot; in particular, thanks to their access to reliable recovery, Slowbro and Empoleon give it competition as a physically bulky Water-type and Stealth Rock setter, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf, in conjunction with a Relaxed Nature, can be used to let Swampert reliably damage Ground-types like Mamoswine and Hippowdon as well as hit Hippowdon for decent damage. Rocky Helmet can be used to rack up chip damage on physical attackers like Bisharp and especially Maushold, though the lack of recovery from Leftovers greatly cuts into Swampert's longevity. Ice Punch is an option that lets Swampert target the likes of Noivern and Cyclizar, but is rather weak outside of Ice-weak targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types, such as Chesnaught and Wo-Chien, resist all of Swampert's attacks and can either whittle it down with Leech Seed or, less commonly, OHKO it with a 4x effective Grass-type move. Hisuian Lilligant, while more niche, can also reliably OHKO it with its Grass moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Because they are immune to Earthquake, the likes of Noivern and Gyarados can take punishment from Swampert before wearing it down with their powerful attacks. However, none of them like having their Heavy-Duty Boots removed, and Gyarados must watch out for Roar.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Slowbro can safely come in on any of Swampert's moves before threatening it with a burn. Additionally, Slowbro can use variants lacking Roar as setup fodder. Despite being weak to Water-type moves, Hippowdon can punish Flip Turn with Rocky Helmet while wearing Swampert down with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Gardevoir and Basculegion-F can threaten Swampert out with their powerful special attacks and, in the case of the former, cripple it with Trick. However, neither of them like switching into Earthquake or, unless Basculegion-F is running Weakness Policy, Knock Off. If carefully positioned, Weakness Policy Armarouge can survive Swampert's super-effective attacks before punishing it with Energy Ball and potentially sweeping its team.</p>",

      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swampert is able to leverage its good defensive typing and bulk in order to act as a solid Stealth Rock setter for a variety of teams. Knock Off lets Swampert punish Pokemon reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots that attempt to switch in, such as Noivern and Galarian Zapdos. Flip Turn allows Swampert to act as a slow pivot to safely bring in a teammate, while Roar can be used to phaze Pokemon that attempt to set up on it, such as Mew and Gyarados. Leftovers helps Swampert shore up its lack of recovery, giving it an easier time checking offensive threats like Bisharp. Tera Ghost lets Swampert block Rapid Spin from Cyclizar as well as Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos. However, Swampert loses its ability to check Dark-types like Bisharp and Krookodile if it Terastallizes. Tera Poison can instead be used to turn Swampert's Grass weakness into a resistance while also letting it avoid Toxic from Umbreon.</p> <p>Swampert shines on offense and bulky offense teams that require role compression. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Swampert greatly appreciates Wish support from the likes of Jirachi and Umbreon, as well as the former's ability to check special attackers like Gardevoir and the latter wearing down bulky Pokemon with Toxic. In exchange, Swampert checks physical attackers that can potentially threaten them, like Entei and Mienshao, respectively, and phazes setup sweepers that attempt to exploit them, like Bisharp. If running Flip Turn, Swampert pairs nicely with other pivots like Raikou and Galarian Zapdos, as they are able to gradually wear down the opposing team over the course of a game. Hisuian Goodra makes for an excellent partner for Swampert, as it can check Flying- and Grass-types like Noivern and Wo-Chien, respectively; in exchange, Swampert can bring it in safely with Flip Turn and check opposing Ground-types like Mamoswine and Krookodile. Strong attackers like Galarian Zapdos and Magnezone also appreciate Swampert's ability to wear down their checks with Stealth Rock while also bringing them in safely with Flip Turn.

  "Gardevoir": {

Very few Pokemon in the tier are able to come in on its STAB combination, and the few that do, like Registeel and Hisuian Goodra, often find themselves crippled by being given a Choice Scarf with Trick. Additionally, Gardevoir can give powerful teammates like Galarian Zapdos, Volcanion, and Mamoswine a second chance to break through teams with Healing Wish. However, Gardevoir's awkward natural Speed tier makes it heavily reliant on holding a Choice Scarf to outrun threats like Noivern and non-Choice Scarf Gengar, making it rather prediction-heavy. Its otherwise great offensive typing leaves it walled by Steel-types like Jirachi and Empoleon; while these Pokemon are often crippled by Trick, this forces Gardevoir to have to choose between continuing to act as speed control or crippling a Pokemon that otherwise walls it. Gardevoir's typing is also underwhelming defensively; when combined with its poor bulk, this leaves it vulnerable to faster revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, and priority from the likes of Bisharp and Entei.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic Noise is an alternative Psychic-type STAB option that, while weaker than Psychic, can let Gardevoir hinder bulkier Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon by preventing them from recovering. Psyshock is another alternative STAB move that lets Gardevoir target the likes of Chansey and Calm Mind Suicune, hitting their weaker Defense stats. Gardevoir can run Focus Blast or Mystical Fire to prevent it from being walled by Steel-types like Registeel, letting it retain its Choice Scarf for longer. Mystical Fire also lets it reliably hinder special attackers like Nasty Plot Mew and Hisuian Goodra on the switch. However, running coverage forces Gardevoir to forgo one of its valuable utility moves. Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp are usable utility alternatives; the former lets Gardevoir retain its item while forcing progress, while the latter can cripple physical sweepers like Bisharp and Gyarados as well as Steel-type switch-ins like Jirachi. Teleport lets Gardevoir keep up momentum for its team and bring in threatening wallbreakers, though its poor bulk makes it vulnerable to being KOed before it can pivot out. Choice Specs can be run over Choice Scarf to amplify Gardevoir's damage output, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra, though Gardevoir's awkward Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to faster attackers like Krookodile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Gardevoir's STAB combination is resisted by the tier's many bulky Steel-types, like Empoleon, Assault Vest Magnezone, Registeel, and Jirachi, with the last three being able to threaten it out with their Steel-type STAB moves. Hisuian Goodra, while lacking a resistance to Moonblast, can also come in safely thanks to its good special bulk and threaten Gardevoir out. However, all of these Pokemon must be wary of being given a Choice Scarf, though Jirachi can run a Choice Scarf of its own to get the jump on Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey can sponge Gardevoir's attacks comfortably, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and wear it down with Seismic Toss, while Alolan Muk is similarly able to take a Moonblast from Gardevoir before threatening it out with Poison Jab.

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Draped in its finest attire, Choice Scarf Gardevoir has established itself as one of the premier options for speed control in RU. Choice Scarf ensures that Gardevoir outpaces the entirety of the unboosted RU metagame as well as giving it the edge over slower Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F. Trick gives Gardevoir the option to bog down common switch-ins like Jirachi and Registeel with a Choice Scarf, limiting their survivability by removing potential Leftovers as well as forcing them to lock into a move should they decide to stay in. It also provides the added benefit of preventing slow Calm Mind users like Slowbro and Reunicles from setting up. Healing Wish allows Gardevoir to bring back a weakened teammate from the brink. Notably, Trace provides unique depth to this set. For example, being able to Trace Cyclizar's or Slowbro's Regenerator gives Gardevoir an avenue for self-sufficient recovery, Basculegion's Adaptability allows Gardevoir to supercharge its Psychic and Moonblast without needing to expend Tera, and Volcanion's Water Absorb allows Gardevoir to switch in without worry of eating a stray Steam Eruption. Tera Fairy is Gardevoir's Tera type of choice, bolstering its already formidable Moonblasts and allowing it to secure guaranteed 2HKO's on Pokemon such as Slowbro and Reuniclus as well as an important OHKO on Assault Vest Cyclizar, which is otherwise capable of tanking one Moonblast from full. Defensively, dropping the Psychic typing gives Gardevoir key resistances to a common priority move in Bisharp's Sucker Punch that would otherwise be liable to revenge kill Gardevoir.</p> <p>The host of tools that Gardevoir brings to the table means that it finds itself as a competent addition to several meta-relevant playstyles. Hyper offense finds itself greatly appreciating Gardevoir's defensive profile with its Dragon immunity and 4x Fighting resist, Healing Wish giving one of its teammates like Bisharp or Maushold a second chance to sweep, and its role as a revenge killer for a structure that often struggles against Swift Swim sweepers like Barraskewda and Kingdra. Outside of hyper offense, Gardevoir can find success on balance and bulky offense builds for much of the same reasons it thrives on hyper offense while also contributing a high-impact Trick. Being able to pawn off the Choice Scarf and cripple an opponent's wall or wallbreaker like Registeel or Armarouge is a huge boon to fat structures looking to wear down the opposing team. Fighting-types such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao are great running mates with their ability to take on common Steel-types like Jirachi, Registeel, and Empoleon that Gardevoir would otherwise struggle against. Special breakers like Volcanion and Magnezone serve a similar role with their ability to threaten Steel-types, and Magnezone specifically is able to trap and remove certain Steel-types entirely. As a Choice Scarf user, Gardevoir immensely benefits from entry hazard support to soften the opposing team up before attempting to clean, so setters such as Chesnaught, Klefki, and Krookodile make for great teammates.</p>"

Breloom also a great teammate for Armarouge, which dispatches bulky Psychic-type Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus while Breloom switches into the plenty of bulky Dark- and Water-type Pokemon like Umbreon and Empoleon that Armarouge might struggle with. Similarly, Slowbro pairs well with Breloom, as it resists Fire- and Psychic-type attacks like Sacred Fire and Psychic Noise from Entei and Reuniclus for it, while Breloom resists Electric- and Dark-type attacks like Thunderbolt from Raikou and Magnezone and Knock Off from Krookodile. Krookodile is also a great partner for Breloom, as it removes Heavy-Duty Boots and Rocky Helmet from foes like Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Hippowdon while also setting up Stealth Rock to chip it's usual checks like Chesnaught. Physical sweepers like Bisharp and Gyarados enjoy Breloom weakening physical walls like Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Hippowdon while absorbing Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Umbreon and the aforementioned Slowbro.</p>"

  "Torkoal": {
    "overview": "<p>Torkoal is a solid weather setter in the RU metagame, using its great physical bulk and utility to establish sun and provide entry hazard control for its typically frail teammates. While it competes directly with Ninetales for the role of sun setter, Torkoal carves out a niche because of its access to both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, providing great role compression and allowing sun teams to stack more offensive options like Hisuian Lilligant, Slither Wing, and Venusaur. It can also leverage its great Defense stat to use the powerful Fighting-type attack Body Press, which threatens the most common spinner in the metagame in Cyclizar. While Torkoal is quite bulky physically, it does struggle to tank many special attacks, with common Choice Specs wallbreakers like Basculegion-F, Magnezone, and Hisuian Goodra all threatening OHKOs, which can make it difficult to reliably establish and maintain hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Torkoal can use Solar Beam to nail Water-types like Basculegion-F and Slowbro. Earth Power lets Torkoal hit opposing Torkoal and Volcanion super effectively. Will-O-Wisp can catch physical setup sweepers like Gyarados and Mimikyu by surprise. Choice Specs Eruption sets can fit on Trick Room teams, blowing through would-be checks like Cyclizar and Slowbro with Tera Fire, though Trick Room teams are not a reliable playstyle in this tier. Torkoal can opt to use Shell Smash in conjunction with an Eject Pack, allowing Copycat users like Espeon to secure an enormous boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Hippowdon is inarguably the best weather setter in the tier and can effectively switch into and threaten Torkoal. Politoed rain can also outmuscle Torkoal with its strong team members like Basculegion-F and Kilowattrel.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite sponging physical attacks comfortably, Torkoal is threatened by nearly every special wallbreaker in the tier, such as Gengar, Hisuian Goodra, and Basculegion-F.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gyarados, Slowbro, and Volcanion can comfortably sponge non-Solar Beam attacks from Torkoal. Empoleon can threaten Knock Off to remove Heat Rock and Surf that is still threatening under sun. Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune can use Torkoal as setup fodder with ease, burning sun turns in the process.</p>",

      "Sun Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Torkoal can function as the primary Stealth Rock user on sun teams because of its immense physical bulk, allowing it to establish entry hazards while sponging attacks for its teammates. Lava Plume is used to potentially spread burns, which can help whittle specially defensive walls like Fezandipiti and Hisuian Goodra down and cripple physical attackers like Rhyperior and Hippowdon. Body Press uses Torkoal's enormous Defense stat to nail Cyclizar, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra. Heat Rock is used to extend the duration of sun, though it does make Torkoal susceptible to hazard chip damage. Tera Ghost is used to spinblock against Cyclizar in an emergency and provide an immunity to Fighting-type attacks from Choice-locked Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion.</p> <p>While Torkoal is often found on sun teams, it can also fit on bulky offense teams that want to maximize the output of another great sun team member, Slither Wing. Slither Wing is an especially valuable teammate, using sun to active Protosynthesis and improve the recovery granted by Morning Sun, making offensive pivot sets quite effective at wallbreaking and pivoting. Offensive Chlorophyll Pokemon, like Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur, can enter the field and provide immediate wallbreaking power while also having the potential to snowball as setup sweepers. Other defensive partners like Eject Button Amoonguss and Slowbro can be used to provide safe pivots into these offensive teammates, maximizing the amount of sun turns while using Regenerator to recover the damage taken. Bulky offense teammates that can use the sun to their advantage include Armarouge and Volcanion, which can threaten massive damage while sun is active, as both are comfortably able to 2HKO even Fire-resistant Pokemon like Noivern and Talonflame.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the metagame, being able to serve as a wallbreaker, revenge killer, setup sweeper, or entry hazard setter depending on the needs of its team. Its phenomenal STAB coverage and access to U-turn allow it to threaten a majority of the metagame with strong neutral attacks and pivot out of physically defensive switch-ins like Chesnaught. Flygon's immunities to Ground- and Electric-type moves as well as Spikes from Pokemon like Hippowdon, Magnezone, and Chesnaught supplement its defensive utility and longevity as a pivot. However, Flygon suffers from Attack and Speed stats that are middling for an offensive Pokemon along with a lack of access to utility options such as Defog and recovery, often putting it below alternatives like Choice Scarf Krookodile as a revenge killer, Dragon Dance Gyarados as a setup sweeper, and Noivern as pivot support. Furthermore, Flygon's mediocre bulk, which cements its place as a jack of all trades, master of none, renders it vulnerable to faster offensive threats including Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos as well as the most common Pokemon in the tier, Draco Meteor Cyclizar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic Noise is an option on pivot sets that allows Flygon to make progress against its switch-ins like Hippowdon and Chesnaught. Lum Berry can be used on Dragon Dance sets to either provide a free turn to set up on the likes of Will-O-Wisp Talonflame and Stun Spore Amoonguss or neutralize confusion from Outrage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Many common physical walls in the metagame, including Slowbro, Umbreon, and Chesnaught, take little damage from Flygon's attacks as well as threaten it back with their own attacks and, in the case of the former two, status conditions.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Faster Fairy-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Ribombee can threaten non-Choice Scarf Flygon with an OHKO. Mimikyu is also able to take a hit from Flygon and eliminate it thanks to Disguise, though Flygon is able to break Disguise and pivot out simultaneously with U-turn if it isn't locked into a move.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Common Dragon-types like Noivern and Cyclizar outspeed non-Choice Scarf Flygon and threaten it with Draco Meteor.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Stealth Rock Flygon is an excellent offensive Ground-type that is able to make progress even against its best switch-ins with Stealth Rock. Scale Shot improves Flygon's ability to act as an offensive threat and cleaner. U-turn enables it to deal decent damage to and pivot out of its defensive checks like Slowbro and Chesnaught. Stone Edge is an alternative that provides coverage against Flying-types such as Talonflame and Gyarados. Loaded Dice helps guarantee OHKOs on Dragon-types like Cyclizar and Noivern with Scale Shot. Levitate provides Flygon with great defensive utility in an immunity to Ground-type moves and most entry hazards, which pairs well with its natural resistance to Stealth Rock and cements it as a reliable pivot. Tera Steel flips all of Flygon's weaknesses to resistances, allowing it to strike back against threats such as Noivern and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. It also provides a valuable immunity to poison and synergizes with Levitate by making Flygon immune to one of the Steel-type's most glaring weaknesses in Ground-type attacks. Tera Ghost is an option that gives Flygon valuable immunities to strong attacks such as Galarian Zapdos's Close Combat, Maushold's Population Bomb, and Entei's Extreme Speed. Tera Fairy is viable due to its immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragon-types like Hisuian Goodra and Cyclizar that Flygon can proceed to promptly take out, along with its resistance to common physical attacks such as Krookodile's Knock Off and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Stealth Rock Flygon is a great fit on both balanced and offensive structures looking for an offensive Ground-type entry hazard setter. Flygon's decent natural bulk makes it an easy-to-fit pivot and Volt Switch absorber in almost any team. It sets itself apart from other options like Krookodile with its defensive utility in its Ground immunity and resistance to Fire-type moves, which pairs well with common Steel-types like Empoleon, Jirachi, and Bisharp by providing a switch-in to threats such as Krookodile and Armarouge. These Steel-types in turn can comfortably tank Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Draco Meteor Cyclizar looking to take Flygon out. Special wallbreakers such as Gengar, Basculegion-F, and Armarouge work well with U-turn Flygon, as they can pivot into its defensive checks like Slowbro and Chesnaught and immediately threaten to blow holes in the opposing team. Thanks to Scale Shot, Flygon can serve as a decent late-game cleaner and therefore, it fits nicely in bulkier structures with Spikes setters such as Gastrodon and Chesnaught that aim to wear down the opposing team by stacking hazards.</p>"

Outrage hits Ground-resistant foes such as Chesnaught and Talonflame hard. Dragon Claw can be used for a safer option that doesn't lock Flygon in. Stone Edge is another option that decimates the likes of Talonflame and Noivern without locking itself into Outrage. First Impression provides valuable priority, allowing it to keep setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Tidy Up Maushold in check; this provides immense utility against hyper offense teams. U-turn allows it to pivot out of bad matchups such as Chesnaught and Slowbro and bring in dangerous wallbreakers like Armarouge and Volcanion. Choice Band lets Flygon threaten physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon. Levitate provides Flygon with a Spikes immunity, allowing it to function as a resilient pivot. Tera Steel flips the Fairy- and Dragon-type weakness into a resistance, turning the tables on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Noivern, and opposing Flygon. Tera Bug strengthens Flygon's U-turn and makes First Impression even more potent at revenge killing threats such as Armarouge and Maushold.</p> <p>Choice Band Flygon fits best on bulky offense teams, which enjoy its role compression with its Ground and Electric immunities as well as its wallbreaking prowess, pivoting ability, and priority. Flygon likes pairing up with partners such as Life Orb Reuniclus, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Nasty Plot Mew, which rip apart Flygon answers such as Chesnaught and Slowbro, while Flygon takes care of Steel-type Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra and Jirachi that trouble them. Gardevoir is also capable of bringing Flygon back from the brink with Healing Wish, letting it continue to break walls. Frail special attackers such as Noivern and Gengar also enjoy Flygon's ability to bring them in safely in front of specially frail Pokemon like Chesnaught and Slowbro. Slow special wallbreakers like Volcanion, Empoleon, and Magnezone appreciate the easy entry Flygon provides with U-turn on Pokemon such as Slowbro and Hippowdon, while Flygon busts through special tanks such as Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra for them; all of them resist Fairy-type moves from Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Mimikyu for Flygon, and the latter two resist Dragon-type moves from the likes of Noivern. Rotom-C is another great partner, as it threatens Hippowdon and Slowbro while forming a VoltTurn core with Flygon. Calm Mind Suicune is also a great teammate that enjoys free setup opportunities on the likes of Talonflame and Hippowdon while still providing Flygon a switch-in against the likes of Basculegion-F and Noivern; in return, Flygon is immune to Electric and deals with Hisuian Goodra. Bulky Steel-type pokemon such as Jirachi and Registeel make great partners, as they check the aforementioned Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon.</p>"

Stone Edge allows it to take out Flying-types like Talonflame. Scale Shot hits Grass-types like Chesnaught hard and helps Flygon to sweep by further boosting its Speed. Fire Punch, usually paired with Tera Fire, is an alternative that can similarly threaten Grass-types and hits certain targets like Chesnaught and Forretress for super effective damage. Loaded Dice helps guarantee OHKOs on Cyclizar at +0 as well as Galarian Zapdos after Stealth Rock at +2. Leftovers instead boosts Flygon's longevity, which can allow it to set up multiple times. Levitate provides immunities to Earthquake from Krookodile and Hippowdon as well as Spikes, creating more opportunities for Flygon to switch in safely. Tera Steel is fantastic defensively, as it flips all of Flygon's weaknesses into resistances, enabling it to turn would-be threats like Noivern and Choice Scarf Gardevoir into setup opportunities. Tera Fire instead boosts the power of Fire Punch and gives Flygon an immunity to burn from Will-O-Wisp Talonflame, which also provides it with a free turn to set up.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Flygon fits best on offense structures, varying from hyper offense to bulky offense, looking for a powerful setup sweeper and late-game cleaner with good defensive utility. Its decent bulk combined with Levitate frequently allows it to set up without fear of getting eliminated easily by Ground-types like Krookodile and priority attacks such as Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Extreme Speed from Entei. It appreciates teammates that can wear the opposing team down to being in range of Flygon's attacks and enable a late-game sweep. Entry hazard setters like Kleavor, Jirachi, and Chesnaught therefore pair well with Flygon. Other wallbreakers and sweepers, notably Bisharp, Basculegion-F and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, can similarly help Flygon fulfill its role by wearing down its defensive checks like Chesnaught and Slowbro. Status spreaders such as Thunder Wave Slowbro, Will-O-Wisp Talonflame, and Thunder Wave Reuniclus can also support Flygon by crippling targets such as Noivern, Mimikyu, and Cyclizar, respectively.</p>"

A Choice Scarf lets Flygon outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and a few other Choice Scarf users, including key targets like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Levitate enables Flygon to handle Krookodile and Hippowdon more effectively and improves its reliability as a pivot with an immunity to Spikes. Tera Steel flips all of Flygon's weaknesses to Dragon-, Fairy- and Ice-type moves into resistances, enabling it to survive a hit from and take out would-be checks such as Noivern, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Basculegion-F.

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>The big bad crawdad of competitive Pokemon, Crawdaunt remains a relevant wallbreaker and stall dismantler several generations after its debut. Choice Band and Adaptability make switching into Crawdaunt nigh impossible, as it fires off massive Knock Offs and Crabhammers. With little regard to physical walls' existence, Crawdaunt excels in taking advantage of safe entry points provided by teammates to force concessions every time it hits the field, as switching into the combination of Dark- and Water-type attacks is difficult for even the bulkiest of walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. With access to Aqua Jet, Crawdaunt can overcome its relative slowness against offensive foes, picking up KOs and dealing big damage before it can be taken out in return. Unfortunately, Crawdaunt is still a bit slow and frail and competes for a spot against notable faster and bulkier wallbreakers like Volcanion, Basculegion-F, and Terrakion. Along with the lack of Speed, Crawdaunt also suffers from a frailness that makes it susceptible to being taken out by the faster Pokemon in the metagame like Gardevoir, Kleavor, and Galarian Zapdos.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With a Jolly nature, Dragon Dance improves Crawdaunt's Speed enough to outpace notable threats like Kleavor and Mienshao after just one boost. Liquidation can be used over Crabhammer for a more accurate attack. Covert Cloak allows Crawdaunt to set up against Scald users, like Slowbro and Suicune, without fear of getting burned.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Crawdaunt struggles to keep pace against offensive teams, often relying on Aqua Jet, as it can't outspeed the opposition. Faster wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Gardevoir threaten to KO Crawdaunt before it can leverage its absurd offensive output for balance teams reliant on it.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Gastrodon and Volcanion, because of their abilities Storm Drain and Water Absorb, respectively, prevent Crawdaunt from freely using Crabhammer to power its way through teams. Suicune does not have an immunity to Water but does prevent Crawdaunt from staying in comfortably by threatening Scald burns, while Barraskewda can use the threat of Close Combat to pivot into more favorable matchups.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Rocky Helmet</strong>: Coming in multiple times throughout a game to fire off massive attacks is Crawdaunt's specialty, which makes it susceptible to getting worn down by entry hazards. Similarly, Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Amoonguss and especially Chesnaught cause problems for Crawdaunt, racking up chip damage while making Crawdaunt far less imposing by recovering their health back.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Amoonguss and Chesnaught are two defensive Grass-types that can often switch into Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and recover off most of the damage, with both threatening to KO it back with Giga Drain and Body Press, respectively. Wo-Chien similarly can take many of Crawdaunt's strongest attacks and recover HP back with Leech Seed. Hisuian Lilligant is a niche offensive pick but matches up well into Crawdaunt, using it to set up Victory Dance and threaten a sweep late-game.</p>",

Aqua Jet ensures an already set up Crawdaunt can fire off strong attacks before being revenge killed, preventing faster Pokemon like Flygon, Gardevoir, and Gengar from stopping a potential sweep. Adaptability-boosted Knock Off is Crawdaunt's most spammable attack, providing utility in item removal with the benefit of being incredibly difficult to switch into generally. Life Orb maximizes the breaking potential of Crawdaunt, enabling it to comfortably 2HKO nearly the entire unboosted metagame, including notable walls like Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Slowbro. Crawdaunt does not get much value from using Terastallization, as the interaction between Terastallization and Adaptability provides minimal gain generally, but Tera Water is still the default choice to boost damage output for Aqua Jet while also removing the weakness to Bug and Fighting.</p> <p>Balance and bulky offense teams looking for a powerful wallbreaker, setup sweeper, and priority revenge killer can use Swords Dance Crawdaunt to fill all of these roles comfortably. As one of the strongest physical attackers in the metagame, Crawdaunt often is paired with strong Volt Switch users, namely Magnezone and Raikou, to form a dynamic duo that keeps the opponent from getting comfortable, as specially defensive walls like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon get worn down quickly trying to keep pace with the pivoting. Similarly, other strong physical setup sweepers, like Dragon Dance Flygon and Gyarados, can take advantage of Crawdaunt racking up massive damage on physically defensive walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro to secure their own late-game sweep. However, Crawdaunt is often on a time crunch with regards to health, as it takes all forms of entry hazard chip damage in addition to its own Life Orb recoil and potential Rocky Helmet chip, making hazard removal teammates that can pivot Crawdaunt in safely like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame crucial to minimize the damage it takes and provide safe entry points against common switch-ins like Hippowdon, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro. Teams that utilize Crawdaunt often want to support it with their own hazards to capitalize on its strong Knock Off, making partners like Chesnaught, Jirachi, and Klefki valuable as both hazard setters and defensive pivots into Electric- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Raikou and Mienshao. Defensive teammates like Bellibolt, Empoleon, and Jirachi can provide immense value as switch-ins to revenge killers like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir while being able to provide safe pivots into Crawdaunt. Chesnaught and Wo-Chien are two of the few reliable Crawdaunt counters in the metagame, making teammates that can handle them like Ribombee and Galarian Zapdos appreciated.</p>"

Aqua Jet functions as a STAB priority attack that allows Crawdaunt to overcome its relative slowness, picking up valuable revenge kills and chip damage on faster threats like Armarouge, Maushold, and Galarian Zapdos. Close Combat gives Crawdaunt additional breaking power against Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon like Bisharp and Hisuian Goodra. Adaptability, in conjunction with Crabhammer and Knock Off, renders physical walls neutral to its STAB attacks like Amoonguss and Quagsire unable to weather the storm as Crawdaunt 2HKOes them with ease. Tera Water does not get much value offensively, as Adaptability offsets a majority of the boost provided by Terastallization, so Crawdaunt does not often Terastallize outside of the rare instances where it can improve a damage roll against a foe. Tera Water does remove Crawdaunt's weaknesses to common priority attacks like First Impression and Mach Punch, though it also eliminates the Adaptability boost for Knock Off, which is a tough concession to make.</p> <p>Balance and bulky offense teams needing a reliable Knock Off user and wallbreaker appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to do both well. Teammates like Cyclizar, Jirachi, and Galarian Zapdos can pivot to Crawdaunt against incoming physical walls, such as Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Slowbro, to provide safe opportunities to use its raw power to break holes into the opposition. Cyclizar and Noivern are exceptional teammates, as they can both pivot and remove entry hazards from the field, which Crawdaunt appreciates to retain health throughout a game. Similarly, defensive partners like Bellibolt and Magnezone can slowly pivot to Crawdaunt, providing valuable entry points against bulkier walls like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon. Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Krookodile appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to break through defensive Pokemon like Quagsire, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon, enabling them to clean late-game. Slowbro and Jirachi provide speed control in the form of Thunder Wave, giving valuable opportunities for Crawdaunt to break through faster Pokemon like Jirachi, Terrakion, and Volcanion. Defensive teammates that can absorb Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks from revenge killers like Gardevoir and Mienshao are a necessity for Crawdaunt, making Jirachi and Talonflame key teammates that can take attacks and provide safe entry points with U-turn. Hazard stacking cores, with setters like Chesnaught, Jirachi, and Klefki, can use Crawdaunt's Knock Off as a way to remove Heavy-Duty Boots while forcing switches, accruing damage quickly.</p>"

It can serve as a blanket check to a variety of threats, such as Krookodile, Entei, and Jirachi, and it can punish the latter two's status spreading with Marvel Scale. However, Milotic faces intense competition from the tier's many bulky Water-types, particularly Slowbro and Vaporeon; the former has Regenerator and a wider movepool, and the latter can support its teammates with Wish. Additionally, Milotic is rather passive, meaning that it can be exploited by Pokemon that don't mind taking Scald, like Volcanion, Gastrodon, and Reuniclus. Even with its mixed bulk, Milotic can find itself overwhelmed by particularly strong attackers, such as Maushold, Galarian Zapdos, and Gengar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used to target Dragon- and Flying-types such as Cyclizar. Covert Cloak protects Milotic from Psychic Noise and lets it check Jirachi without worrying about Iron Head. Leftovers grants Milotic passive recovery, which is especially useful if it happens to get burned. However, the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots worsens Milotic's matchup into entry hazard stacking teams. Milotic can utilize a physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 208 Def / 48 Spe with a Bold nature to outspeed Golurk, though this leaves it more vulnerable to special attackers like Basculegion-F. On hazard stacking teams, a more offensive set can be used with Competitive to deter Defog from Pokemon like Noivern and Talonflame; however, it is largely outclassed by Empoleon as a Water-type Competitive user. Mirror Coat lets Milotic lure in and take out special attackers like Raikou.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Volcanion is public enemy number one for Milotic due to its ability to stop Recover with Taunt while being completely immune to Scald. It can then proceed to wear down Milotic with its coverage moves, particularly Sludge Bomb. Cyclizar can also Taunt Milotic before pivoting out into a teammate that can offensively pressure it, but Cyclizar dislikes being burned by Scald if not running Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnezone and Raikou don't particularly mind Scald and can threaten Milotic out with their Electric-type moves, potentially getting a free pivot with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Specially offensive Dragon-types like Hisuian Goodra and Noivern don't mind being burned by Scald and can wear Milotic down over the course of a battle, though the latter doesn't like taking Dragon Tail. Wo-Chien takes practically nothing from Milotic's attacks while draining it with Leech Seed and Ruination; however, it dislikes being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Milotic struggles to stop sweepers that have already set up, such as Maushold and Nasty Plot Gengar. Additionally, Choice Band users, such as Crawdaunt and Galarian Zapdos, can heavily damage it with their STAB attacks.</p>",

Marvel Scale lets Milotic absorb burns and paralysis for its teammates while boosting its Defense. Milotic uses Heavy-Duty Boots to continue to pivot reliably, even against Spikes-stacking teams. A Calm nature prevents Milotic from being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Basculegion-F's Shadow Ball, while max Defense allows it to take on physical attackers like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile. Tera Poison grants Milotic a resistance to Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks, letting it better check Pokemon like Mienshao and Mimikyu while also granting it an immunity to Toxic from the likes of Umbreon and Amoonguss. By removing its Electric weakness, Tera Poison also allows Milotic to take on Raikou and non-Choice Specs Magnezone.</p> <p>Milotic's access to reliable recovery and ability to punish status with Marvel Scale makes it a good fit for bulky offense and balance teams. Because Milotic tends to pivot out against Water-resistant Pokemon like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro, Pokemon that can pressure them, such as Mienshao, Mamoswine, and Magnezone, appreciate being brought in safely against them. The former two also appreciate Milotic's ability to punish burns with Marvel Scale. Volcanion is a big issue for Milotic due to its immunity to Water-type moves and ability to wear Milotic down with its powerful attacks and Taunt; as such, checks to these Pokemon, like Noivern and Raikou, make for essential teammates. Specially defensive pivots like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Jirachi can help Milotic wear down the opposing team by removing items with Knock Off and causing foes to flinch with Iron Head, respectively, while also appreciating its ability to spread burns with Scald. In return, they can more reliably check powerful special wallbreakers like Basculegion-F and Gardevoir, respectively. Jirachi can also keep Milotic healthy with Wish and absorb poison from the likes of Amoonguss. Hisuian Goodra enjoys the burns spread by Milotic's Scald as well as how it brings in and pivots on Electric-types, such as Magnezone and Raikou. Physically defensive Pokemon like Gligar and Gastrodon help Milotic fortify its team against strong physical wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Maushold, especially if Milotic burns them with Scald.</p>"

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel is an excellent mixed wall and Stealth Rock setter, capable of standing firm in the face of many attackers throughout the game and keeping up entry hazards. IronPress allows Registeel to turn into an offensive threat while walling any physical attacker, letting it set up against a myriad of foes like Mimikyu and Kleavor, while Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon like Gyarados and Basculegion-F. Registeel's typing allows it to check the Fairy-, Poison-, and Dragon-types in the tier like Gardevoir, Gengar, and Cyclizar with ease, while its incredible bulk allows it to take neutral attacks from Empoleon and Gengar. However, Registeel lacks reliable recovery, relying on the meager healing of Leftovers, which means that it can be chipped down across the game by hazards and is vulnerable to item removal like Knock Off. Pokemon that defeat Registeel, like Galarian Zapdos, Mamoswine, and Volcanion, are all very common in the metagame. Registeel also poses very little threat to the Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that shrug off Body Press, like Basculegion-F and Slowbro, granting them easy entry points. In addition, Registeel's ability to keep Stealth Rock up is hindered by its matchup against common hazard removers, as it does not want to switch into Cyclizar's Knock Off or Talonflame's Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Registeel can use a combination of Fling and Toxic Orb to poison a Pokemon such as Hippowdon or Slowbro, providing a single-use offensive option that is not expected in its arsenal. Curse is an alternative setup option that slows the Defense boosts in exchange for boosting the damage of Heavy Slam, but it is recommended to use a different Tera type alongside it. Tera Poison grants Registeel a resistance to Fighting while maintaining its Fairy resististance and poison immunity. Tera Fairy also grants a Fighting resistance in addition to a Dark resistance. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Slowbro and Flying-types like Talonflame and Gyarados. Protect can be used to improve the effectiveness of Leftovers and to scout for moves from Choice-locked Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile. ChestoRest can provide emergency healing and remove negative status effects.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Lucario threaten significant damage on Registeel if it has no Defense boosts. Gallade in particular is incredibly threatening to Registeel as not only does it resist Body Press, but Sacred Sword can ignore any Defense boosts Registeel has attained.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Armarouge, Volcanion, and Entei can deal super effective damage to Registeel and burn it, neutering its Leftovers and damage.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Basculegion-F and Gengar are immune to Body Press, forcing Registeel to hit with its unboosted attack. Tera Ghost is also a common Tera type for physical walls like Chesnaught, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and opposing Registeel.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users like Krookodile, Cyclizar, and Hisuian Goodra are capable of removing Registeel's Leftovers, harming its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: If Registeel has its moves disrupted through the use of moves like Encore, Taunt, and Trick, it is severely hindered and forced to switch out.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Body Press takes advantage of Registeel's high Defense and can hit Pokemon like Bisharp and Cyclizar. Iron Defense improves Registeel's survivability and turns it into an offensive threat thanks to Body Press. Thunder Wave can paralyze Cyclizar and Talonflame for Registeel's allies to deal with them better. Leftovers is necessary due to Registeel's natural lack of recovery. Clear Body prevents stat drops from attacks like Liquidation, Crunch, and Shadow Ball. 180 Defense EVs allow Registeel to survive two Earthquakes from Krookodile most of the time while guaranteeing Registeel can OHKO Umbreon with a +2 Body Press after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Ghost provides Registeel with an immunity to Fighting to beat Pokemon like Gallade and Galarian Zapdos and to block Cyclizar's Rapid Spin. This also allows Registeel to set up against Pokemon with Ground-type attacks like Gastrodon and Earthquake Gyarados.</p> <p>Registeel is a great fit on both bulky offense and balance teams. Because Registeel wants to enter the field often, it is particularly susceptible to Spikes, so entry hazard removers like Noivern, Cyclizar—which Volcanion struggles against—and Defog Talonflame—which counters Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao—make valuable teammates. Due to Registeel's reliance on its Leftovers, a Knock Off absorber is a necessity, a role that Pokemon like Chesnaught, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien are able to perform. Registeel's lack of natural recovery makes Wish a useful option, which can be used by Umbreon and Vaporeon. As Ghost- and Psychic-types like Basculegion-F and Slowbro are able to stand against Registeel's Body Press, it is useful to have allies that can hit them like Gengar, Krookodile, and Mimikyu. Setup sweepers like Slowbro, Calm Mind Armarouge, and Mew can take advantage of Registeel's struggle to touch them, so allies that can disrupt them like Trick Gardevoir and Gengar and Encore Maushold are useful.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi is one of the most dynamic Pokemon in SV RU with a plethora of sets at its disposal. Its diverse movepool gives it access to fantastic utility options such as Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Encore; potent offensive tools such as Iron Head and Calm Mind; and incredible special coverage including moves like Thunder and Aura Sphere, meaning that Jirachi is able to fit almost any role that its team requires; this has the added benefit of making its set difficult to discern on Team Preview. However, in true \"Jack-of-all-Trades, Master of None\" fashion, Jirachi can sometimes find itself outclassed in the plethora of roles it can fill. Its lack of immediate recovery and unspecialized defenses render it inferior to physical walls like Hippowdon and Chesnaught and specially defensive ones like Empoleon. Jirachi's weakness to Dark, in particular Knock Off, holds it back quite a bit from being a reliable entry hazard setter and defensive sponge. On many teams, Jirachi competes for the Psychic-type position with other potent Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus that may fill roles such as spreading status and sweeping with Calm Mind more effectively; hence, opting for Jirachi incurs a noticeable opportunity cost. As a setup sweeper, Jirachi's inability to boost its Speed can leave it fearful of revenge killers like Gengar, Mienshao, and Terrakion. Lastly, Jirachi's relatively weak offensive power means that it can often struggle to make progress, even with a Choice item.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meteor Beam allows Jirachi to compress a setup move and coverage for Pokemon like Volcanion and Talonflame into one moveslot, but it has the drawback of being mostly useless for the rest of the game after Power Herb is used up. Cosmic Power + Weakness Policy is sometimes able to catch opponents off-guard and pull off a devastating sweep; however, it is heavily reliant on the matchup and only works if the opponent doesn't have or has exhausted their anti-setup options such as phazing, Encore, and Trick. Future Sight and Doom Desire can be used alongside wallbreakers such as Mienshao and Terrakion that appreciate assistance against Poison- and Fairy-type switch-ins. Jirachi can also run a Choice Band set with Meteor Mash, capitalizing on Serene Grace giving it a 40% chance to boost its Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Contact Effects</strong>: Being able to fish for flinches, chip damage, and status by freely clicking Iron Head and Body Slam is one of Jirachi's many advantages. Therefore, the presence of Rocky Helmet users such as Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss on practically every bulky team is detrimental to Jirachi, as they prevent it from spamming its physical moves. Static Bellibolt in particular can punish Jirachi greatly by possibly paralyzing it, with Bellibolt itself being immune to Body Slam paralysis and taking practically no damage from Iron Head. Talonflame is similarly able to deter and punish Jirachi's weak attacks with Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Fast wallbreakers</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon like Gengar and Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile can easily threaten Jirachi with their powerful attacks, which gives them an opportunity to take it out or blow holes through its team.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Crawdaunt, and Intimidate Krookodile take little damage from Jirachi's Iron Head and threaten it back with a strong Dark-type attack. Umbreon is particularly effective at checking Jirachi thanks to its amazing bulk, Inner Focus, and Foul Play dealing decent damage to even special Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Armarouge, Rotom-H, and Volcanion can capitalize on Jirachi's inability to deal with them by firing off a devastating attack or setting up to boost their firepower at little risk to themselves. However, they have to be careful not to let Calm Mind Jirachi accrue enough Special Defense boosts such that Jirachi becomes able to survive an attack and take them out.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Utility Jirachi is truly a jack of all trades in RU with its evenly distributed stats, useful part-Steel typing, and access to a litany of support options. Body Slam capitalizes on Serene Grace to spread paralysis at a high rate without being blocked by Taunt. With paralysis and Iron Head flinch chance factored in, Jirachi has a staggering 70% chance to immobilize a foe. Jirachi's final moveslot is flexible and can be fitted to accommodate the specific needs of the team. Encore provides Jirachi with a reliable option to discourage slower setup sweepers such as Slowbro and Bisharp from freely boosting while also giving Jirachi a manner of punishing passive play, being able to lock Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Empoleon into a recovery or entry hazard setting move. U-turn provides Jirachi with a pivoting move, letting it bring in frailer teammates as well as giving it an out from being trapped by Magnet Pull Magnezone. Wish can be used as a support option to heal up teammates on low health, as well as giving Jirachi a somewhat reliable recovery option itself. Leftovers gives Jirachi a source of passive recovery, improving its longevity. 224 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature ensure that Jirachi can outspeed threats such as Mimikyu and Krookodile. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense to better take on special attackers such as Gardevoir. Jirachi's Tera options are also quite flexible and can be changed to suit the needs of the team. Tera Water is useful, as it can help Jirachi emergency check strong Water-types in the tier such as Volcanion and Barraskewda. Tera Steel provides Jirachi a stronger Iron Head and also removes its weakness to Dark, making it less susceptible to moves such as Cyclizar's Knock Off and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Tera Fairy can be used to flip Jirachi's weakness to Dark into a key resistance, as well as giving it useful resistances to several forms of priority in the tier like Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Tera Fairy also removes its weakness to Ground, making matchups into Krookodile and Flygon much more favorable.</p> <p>Utility Jirachi can fit on a slew of both Pokemon and team structures. For example, Jirachi is an excellent fit on an offensive playstyle like rain where it doubles as a Stealth Rock setter as well as a general special sponge, covering for problematic revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Bulky offense and balance teams also appreciate Jirachi, as it brings a host of useful traits such as being a Stealth Rock setter, a pivot, and a great blanket check to common threats such as Gardevoir, Noivern, and opposing Jirachi. With how Cyclizar covers Jirachi's weaknesses to Ghost and Fire, it is a great partner; in return Jirachi can switch into Fairy-type attacks for it. On top of that, these two in tandem also create a formidable pivot core for. Other teammates that can spread paralysis such as Slowbro and Amoonguss also work as great partners with Jirachi, as they can slow down the opposing team giving Jirachi more chances to paraflinch through foes. Slower, frailer wallbreakers like Crawdaunt and Golurk greatly benefit from Jirachi's ability to slow down the opponent's team through paralysis, generate safe entry points with U-turn, and provide support through Wish or Encore. Pivoting cores with Galarian Zapdos and Cyclizar can help keep up momentum and pressure, helping rack up entry hazard chip damage on the opponent's team.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Jirachi is difficult to take down thanks to its typing and natural bulk, which let it stack Calm Mind boosts easily against a large portion of the tier. Psychic Noise prevents slower defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Reuniclus, and Empoleon from healing so Jirachi can eventually beat them. Grass Knot smacks many of the defensive Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that would normally handle other variants of Jirachi well, such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, Slowbro, and Gastrodon. Aura Sphere provides a coverage move that hits Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Hisuian Goodra, and Magnezone super effectively. Thunder nails Water-type Pokemon neutral to Grass Knot such as Gyarados, Volcanion, and Empoleon while boasting a nice chance to paralyze the foe and being a great option versus rain teams. Jirachi can usually afford missing a Thunder thanks to its bulk. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types such as Armarouge, Reuniclus, and opposing Jirachi, which are otherwise safe from Jirachi's other options. Leftovers allows Jirachi to recover health throughout a game thanks to the many switch-in opportunities its bulk and typing offers it. Calm Mind Jirachi will often stay on the field for many turns as it sets up and chips at the opponent's team, so Leftovers recovery will easily pile up. Expert Belt can be used on more aggressive teams to offset the middling immediate power of this set, but be wary that Jirachi will be worn down more quickly. 224 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed Mimikyu and Krookodile. Tera Water allows Jirachi to remove its Ground, Ghost, and Dark weaknesses, as well as letting it resist Armarouge's Armor Cannon and Volcanion's Flamethrower. Tera Fairy transforms Jirachi's Dark weakness into a resistance to handily tank the likes of Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Krookodile's Knock Off while being an overall fantastic defensive typing. Tera Fighting can be used in conjunction with Expert Belt and Aura Sphere to directly threaten high damage on Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon while being Jirachi's best Tera type against Bisharp.</p> <p>Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi works on a wide variety of teams, from offense to balance teams, looking for a bulky Pokemon that can weaken common balance cores while providing defensive value through its natural bulk coupled with resistances to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks and an immunity to poison and Poison-type attacks. Physical walls, like Hippowdon, Amoonguss, and Gligar, can handle physical breakers such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile that Jirachi struggles taking hits from. Krookodile is a great partner, acting as a switch-in to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, fulfilling the entry hazard setter role, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon, and denying recovery attempts from foes with Taunt, which Jirachi can capitalize on. Other more sturdy switch-ins to Ghost-type Pokemon like Basculegion-F and Gengar include Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra and Assault Vest Cyclizar. Fighting-type breakers such as Galarian Zapdos, Terrakion, and Mienshao pair well with Jirachi due to their ability to threaten Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that do well against Jirachi, especially if choosing not to run Aura Sphere, while Jirachi can switch into the Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks targeted at them in return. Because this set has difficulty pulling its weight against hyper offense teams, Pokemon strong against the archetype like Bisharp, Entei, and Umbreon are recommended.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Jirachi provides speed control and offensive pivoting for many team structures. Defensively, Jirachi is a great team presence because of its great defensive typing and natural bulk, with base 100 stats across the board providing it with the longevity needed to switch into several attacks for its teammates. Iron Head is the most reliable STAB option for Jirachi to use, since it has adequate Base Power, is neutral into a majority of the metagame, and boasts a high flinch rate. U-turn is a safe pivot move, allowing powerful partners to come in freely. Choice Scarf Jirachi uses Trick to hinder would-be checks like Amoonguss and Hippowdon, which can also greatly help teammates that struggle against these defensive walls like Krookodile and Terrakion. Healing Wish can give a second opportunity to a teammate that may otherwise not have enough health to get back into a game reliably. Choice Scarf enables Jirachi to outspeed a majority of the tier, including Noivern, Cyclizar, and Maushold. Tera Steel is run to maximize its damage output with Iron Head, which can allow Jirachi to potentially make its way through the opponent's physical wall via flinches, along with hitting several notable benchmarks like OHKOing Terrakion and 2HKOing Noivern and Galarian Zapdos.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is primarily seen in offense and balance structures, where it can pack speed control, support, disruption, and a solid defensive profile into one slot. Jirachi is one of the best switch-ins to Fairy- and Poison-types in the tier, as well as having key resistances to Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks, making it a reliable option to take hits from Gardevoir and Noivern. Teammates weak to Fairy-type moves, such as strong Dragon- or Fighting-types like Cyclizar and Terrakion, are grateful for Jirachi's presence on the team to fall back on. Taking advantage of Choice Scarf Jirachi's ability to hinder and chip at physically defensive walls like Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Palossand, teammates such as Mimikyu and Terrakion can position themselves to set up reliably. Teammates that lack recovery such as Armarouge and Galarian Zapdos can function as both mid-game breakers and late-game cleaners when paired with Healing Wish support from Jirachi.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Defense": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-D's access to the highly coveted Teleport is complemented by its excellent supportive movepool and high defenses. This gives it a niche in being a slow pivot that can take a strong hit and safely bring in another teammate to threaten the opposing team, often creating setup opportunities. Additionally, it's a great physically defensive blanket check for offensive teams that lack a defensive backbone to fall back on. Deoxys-D has a wide utility movepool that can benefit more defensive teams as well, since it has access to moves such as Knock Off, Taunt, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Thunder Wave, all of which help it make progress against slower teams. Deoxys-D also removes items quite easily, inviting in Pokemon such as Bisharp, Registeel, and Golurk, none of which appreciate Knock Off. However, Deoxys-D has many flaws that prevent it from being common. It has a bad defensive typing that leaves it vulnerable to common Pokemon like Krookodile, Bisharp and Gengar as well as the ubiquitous U-turn from the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Jirachi, which can lead to it being overwhelmed by the very Pokemon it's supposed to check. Furthermore, it's very weak and passive, making it easy setup fodder for the likes of Reuniclus and Armarouge. Deoxys-D suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, forcing it to choose between being able to disrupt its foes or making long-term progress with Spikes. Finally, Deoxys-D faces strong competition from Pokemon such as Jirachi, Slowbro, Gligar, and Klefki, all of which can either pivot, set entry hazards, or wall Pokemon more effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers is an alternative if running Spikes in conjunction with Cyclizar, simultaneously lessening pressure to constantly use Recover and making it easier to set multiple layers of Spikes. Rocky Helmet punishes Maushold and prevents Jirachi from trying to flinch Deoxys-D until it gets KOed. Tera Steel gives it a Flying and Bug resistance and much more valuable defensive typing, though it makes it weaker to wallbreakers like Mamoswine. Future Sight could be used to force switches with Teleport to maneuver into an advantageous situation, but it is often too weak. Night Shade gives Deoxys-D consistent, if middling, damage. Mental Herb can negate Taunt from the likes of Krookodile and Noivern once, but other items are more consistent. Deoxys-D can sweep with a moveset of Cosmic Power / Stored Power / Recover / Night Shade, but it often gets overwhelmed and hates the prevalence of Dark-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Bisharp, Krookodile, and Crawdaunt can switch into anything Deoxys-D can throw at them and set up or threaten it out with super effective STAB attacks. However, they usually don't appreciate Knock Off, and some cannot break through Deoxys-D if it's running Colbur Berry.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Slow setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Registeel can use Deoxys-D as setup fodder unless it's running Taunt. Similarly, non-Thunder Wave variants will let faster sweepers like Armarouge and Gyarados set up with impunity.</p> <p><em>Ghost-types</em>*: Gengar can potentially set up against or irreparably damage Deoxys-D. Basculegion-F and Golurk can switch into Deoxys-D and threaten it out easily; Golurk can even block its Thunder Wave. None of these Pokemon like to take a Knock Off, though, and Gengar and Basculegion-F must be wary of paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Entry hazards can wear down Deoxys-D easily throughout the match, forcing it to waste turns using Recover. Deoxys-D has a tendency to lose its item because it's often a switch-in to Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Mamoswine, and this can make entry hazards problematic. Similarly, although Deoxys-D checks Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Jirachi, and Barraskewda, if they click U-turn or Flip Turn, it will cause a lot of chip damage, which can compromise Deoxys-D's ability to pivot effectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Deoxys-D has many viable options for moves, and it's possible to mix and match any combination if it might fit its team better. Teleport supports its teammates with slow pivoting. Knock Off is an excellent support move and synergizes well with the entry hazards that Deoxys-D sets, helping wear down Pokemon like Cyclizar, Bisharp, and Talonflame while hitting Gengar and Basculegion-F. Thunder Wave helps prevent it from being setup fodder against Pokemon like Armarouge, Gengar, and Gyarados. Psychic Noise can hit Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Terrakion. Taunt can be very useful in preventing Deoxys-D from getting statused, hazards being laid, and slow setup sweepers like Slowbro and Suicune from setting up on its face. For both Taunt and Psychic Noise, preventing walls like Empoleon and Hippowdon from healing can put pressure on the opposing team in tandem with Teleport safely letting in wallbreakers. Spikes is preferred because Deoxys-D can set up multiple layers to pressure the opposing team, though Stealth Rock should be used instead if it cannot be fit somewhere else on the team. Heavy-Duty Boots helps with pivoting by minimizing chip damage. Colbur Berry improves its matchup against Knock Off users such as Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mamoswine and is particularly useful on offense teams where switching into these threats can be very hard otherwise. 16 Speed EVs let Deoxys-D outspeed offensive Hisuian Goodra and Magnezone and use Knock Off before they can attack. The rest is dumped into Defense to switch into Galarian Zapdos and Mamoswine better. Since Deoxys-D often forgoes special attacks, an Impish nature maximizes Knock Off damage, but a Bold nature should be run if using Psychic Noise instead. If Deoxys-D eschews attacking moves altogether, then Bold is superior because it is better into Foul Play. A specially defensive spread is a viable alternative if running Deoxys-D with other physical walls like Hippowdon, Klefki, and Wo-Chien, letting it switch into Pokemon like Armarouge and Volcanion and cripple them or pivot out; 96 Speed EVs let it outspeed Volcanion. Pressure lessens the chance of Jirachi flinching Deoxys-D down and drains low PP moves such as Entei's Sacred Fire and Volcanion's Steam Eruption. Tera Ghost lets Deoxys-D spinblock Cyclizar, ensuring its hazards stay up; counter Maushold; and gain a useful Bug resistance, aiding it against U-turn. If the team already has a spinblocker or keeping Spikes on the field isn't central to the team's gameplan, other Tera types can be useful as well; Tera Fairy gives Deoxys-D a better defensive typing that allows it switch into Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mienshao more consistently, while Tera Water completely walls Volcanion and helps against Pokemon like Barraskewda and Bisharp. Both Tera types also get rid of Deoxys-D's Bug and Ghost weaknesses.</p> <p>Deoxys-D is an excellent support Pokemon on offensive structures because it provides a defensive blanket check and can easily pivot into more threatening teammates with Teleport; most of the tier's offensive Pokemon appreciate getting in safely. Deoxys-D is also a decent option on balance teams, where it can make consistent progress with its various utility moves. Slow or frail wallbreakers such as Mamoswine, Volcanion, and Gallade can use slow pivot support to safely break holes into the opposing team early in the game. The holes opened up by them can then be exploited later on by sweepers and cleaners such as Maushold and Galarian Zapdos. In return, Deoxys-D can help pave the way for a sweep with its utility moves and pivoting support. If Deoxys-D is running a set without Thunder Wave, setup sweepers like Armarouge and Gyarados can easily take advantage of it. Therefore, priority users like Mimikyu, Entei, Bisharp, and Mamowsine can help alleviate this concern. Cyclizar complements Spikes Deoxys-D quite well, since Rapid Spin doesn't remove entry hazards on the opposing side unlike Defog Talonflame and Noivern. On top of that, it checks problematic Ghost-types like Basculegion-F and Gengar for Deoxys-D; Krookodile can do the same and also set Stealth Rock. Since Deoxys-D can struggle against VoltTurn, Pokemon like Talonflame and Hippowdon can discourage the use of U-turn and Volt Switch on more defensive builds. Checks to Dark-types, like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Chensaught are necessary to deal with Bisharp and Krookodile. Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao can form a pivoting core with Deoxys-D while both offering Knock Off. Stealth Rock setters like Terrakion, Krookodile, and Hippowdon let Deoxys-D run Spikes and can form a hazard stacking core with it. On Spikes stacking teams, additional Knock Off support from the likes of Krookodile and Wo-Chien is useful to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, and pivoting cores that threaten each other's checks, such as Galarian Zapdos and Basculegion-F or Mienshao and Choice Specs Magnezone, can maximize chip damage quickly by repeatedly threatening out foes.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Infernape is a flexible Pokemon capable of performing a variety of different roles, taking advantage of its high Speed and equal ability to hit with physical or special attacks. This unpredictability can create opportunities, as its different sets have different checks: For example, Hippowdon is a perfect answer to Close Combat, but it gets toasted by Fire Blast. Infernape has a deep movepool with strong coverage options like Grass Knot, Earthquake, and Gunk Shot as well as great utility moves like U-turn, Knock Off, and Encore. With both Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, it can boost its damage no matter which attacks it uses, and it has STAB priority moves on both sides with Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch. However, despite the many roles Infernape can fill, there are often other Pokemon that can perform better in them. Crucial Pokemon like Amoonguss and Empoleon can survive Infernape's attacks, and support from entry hazards or resources like Terastallization is often necessary to facilitate its task. As a special attacker, its power is overshadowed by fellow Fire-types Armarouge and Volcanion, while Terrakion, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao often outperform as Fighting-type wallbreakers. In addition, Infernape's incredible frailty makes it difficult for it to survive against the powerful attacks in the tier, from Gengar's Shadow Ball to Jirachi's Psychic Noise, resulting in very few opportunities to switch in or set up. Infernape also suffers heavily from four-moveslot syndrome: despite its plethora of options it is impossible to fit all of them, and all of its sets will have holes that the opponent can take advantage of.</p>",

Add in the power boost from Blaze, and it also KOes Pokemon like Noivern. Infernape's special sets can use Aura Sphere or Focus Blast as an alternative Fighting-type STAB option, with the drawback of underwhelming power or low accuracy respectively. Swords Dance allows Infernape to force its way through its checks. Knock Off can be used on physical sets to hit Psychic-types like Slowbro and Reuniclus, and it can provide utility to the team with its item removing properties. Mach Punch is a priority option for physical sets that can be improved by Infernape's Iron Fist ability. Encore can grant Infernape more opportunities to set up by locking foes into ineffective moves. Infernape can be used as a lead on hyper offense teams with its ability to set Stealth Rock and threaten hazard removers like Cyclizar. Infernape can also run a mixed attacker set, which will typically be specially biased with Close Combat to hit special walls like Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: None of Infernape's sets have reliable options to answer Fire-types like Armarouge, Entei, and Talonflame. While Infernape can use niche moves like Stone Edge to hit them, using the moveslot for this will likely leave it lacking elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Noivern and Talonflame are able to easily tank Infernape's attacks and recover, then OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon are some of the bulkiest walls in the tier, and they can easily wall physical Infernape and either heal, KO it, or afflict it with status effects. Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon, despite their weakness to Fighting, can cleanly wall Infernape's special sets.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attackers like Extreme Speed Entei, Accelerock Lycanroc-D, and Aqua Jet Crawdaunt and Barraskewda threaten huge damage on Infernape.</p>",

        "description": "<p>While its power is lower than its Fire-type competition in Armarouge and Volcanion, Nasty Plot Infernape offers immediate speed, faster setup, and access to priority while still posing a threat to much of the metagame. Grass Knot is used to hit Water-types such as Basculegion-F, Slowbro, and Suicune. Vacuum Wave hits Cyclizar, Lycanroc-D, and Crawdaunt, which outspeed or OHKO Infernape with Aqua Jet. Air Balloon allows Infernape to safely set up against Ground-types like Hippowdon and Krookodile. Expert Belt can push some damage thresholds, allowing an unboosted Fire Blast to OHKO Jirachi and a +2 Grass Knot to OHKO Suicune. Tera Fighting lets Vacuum Wave OHKO potential revenge killers Barraskewda, Krookodile, and Terrakion after a Nasty Plot. In combination with Expert Belt and entry hazards, Tera Fighting Vacuum Wave is also able to OHKO Assault Vest Cyclizar. Tera Grass gives Infernape resistances to Water and Ground, allowing it to set up against Pokemon such as Empoleon and Gastrodon, and lets Grass Knot OHKO Hippowdon without a boost and OHKO Gyarados at +2. Tera Fairy lets Infernape set up against Fighting-type attackers like Mienshao and Terrakion.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Infernape fits best on offense or bulky offense teams looking for a fast Fire-type attacker and setup sweeper. It notably struggles with some of the special walls in the tier like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon, so it appreciates stronger Fighting- and Fairy-types like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir to help chip them into range of Infernape's attacks. Pivot support is important to get the frail Infernape onto the field safely, with teammates like Noivern, Galarian Zapdos, and Cyclizar being able to do so and inviting in Pokemon that Infernape can beat like Jirachi, Slowbro, and Hippowdon. Entry hazards set by Krookodile, Chesnaught, and Kleavor are able to weaken the Pokemon that Infernape is unable to OHKO at +2, like Empoleon and Slowbro. Knock Off support from Mamoswine, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos can remove items such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Assault Vest, which can enable Infernape to clean late-game once the opposing team is worn down. Teammates like Stone Edge Lycanroc-D and Meteor Beam Necrozma are valuable in hitting the Fire-types, like Armarouge and Entei, that Nasty Plot Infernape struggles to hit.</p>"

Switcheroo allows Infernape to cripple physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. U-turn allows it to pivot out of poorer matchups into teammates that can take a hit or threaten whatever switches in on Infernape. While the recoil of a Blaze-boosted Flare Blitz will likely KO Infernape, it also empowers the move to OHKO Amoonguss, Wo-Chien, and Jirachi. Tera Fighting lets Close Combat OHKO Krookodile after Intimidate and Umbreon.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Infernape is an ideal pick for balance teams that need a fast Fire-type that can pivot, revenge kill, and serve as a late-game cleaner that most other Choice Scarf users cannot outspeed. Entry hazard removal from allies like Cyclizar and Noivern is crucial for Infernape as it wants to enter the field often, and it needs as much help as it can get in order to both survive attacks and Rocky Helmet. Infernape's unique ability to invite physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro in and cripple them with Switcheroo makes it a great partner for other physical attackers like Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Terrakion. Infernape can be a potent part of a VoltTurn core with partners like Raikou, Basculegion-F, and Magnezone that can threaten physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Infernape needs bulky allies like Chesnaught, Umbreon, and Jirachi to take attacks for it, often in the form of priority Aqua Jet from Barraskewda and Crawdaunt or Extreme Speed from Entei.</p>"

  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Empoleon is a fantastic Water-type that can fill either a defensive role with the help of its myriad utility options or an offensive role by utilizing its phenomenal coverage depending on the needs of its team. Empoleon's incredible defensive typing gives it natural resistances to the STAB moves of many of the tier's top Pokemon, including Jirachi, Slowbro, and Cyclizar, which can give it many opportunities to make progress over the course of a game. Empoleon can also utilize its offensive power to blow holes through teams, as there are few Pokemon that can safely switch into all of its attacks, especially after a Competitive boost. Empoleon is mainly held back by its low Speed that allows strong Fighting- and Electric-type wallbreakers to easily force it out and threaten the rest of its team. Furthermore, Empoleon's inability to manually boost its offenses means that special walls like Umbreon can usually tank its attacks with very little consequence. Defensive Empoleon sets particularly can suffer from four-moveslot syndrome, as it often wants to fit more utility moves than it can afford, thereby leaning it into a passive role that can be exploited by setup sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Cannon is a STAB option that can enable Empoleon to deal with Fairy-types like Alolan Ninetales and Gardevoir more easily. Agility can be used on offensive sets to solve Empoleon's Speed problem and enable it to act as a cleaner at the cost of Roost or a coverage move. Shuca Berry allows Empoleon to take out common Ground-type Pokemon like Krookodile and Hippowdon after safely absorbing an Earthquake. Chople Berry similarly enables Empoleon to survive a hit from wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos and strike back. Tera Water is another option on offensive Empoleon that can boost Surf enough to secure certain rolls, including an OHKO on Hippowdon and a 2HKO on Bisharp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Gallade threaten Empoleon and force it out, which give them the opportunity to fire off an attack or pivot safely out of the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Many of the common Calm Mind users in the tier such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, and Slowbro can outheal Empoleon's damage and use it as setup fodder if it isn't running Roar or the right coverage move. Because of its relative passivity, defensive Empoleon can be similarly exploited by other threatening setup sweepers such as Shift Gear Revavroom, Swords Dance Bisharp, and Dragon Dance Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: The most specially defensive Pokemon in the tier like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon can easily shrug off Empoleon's attacks and force progress against it or create an opportunity for a physical wallbreaker to switch in and threaten Empoleon out.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Empoleon is uniquely equipped to provide teams with a strong defensive and offensive presence given its natural bulk and exceptional coverage. Its Water / Steel typing and Special Defense is valuable in a metagame with strong Choice Scarf users such as Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar threatening to use their strong STAB attacks to clean games. Surf is a reliable STAB option for Empoleon, as it hits a lot of the metagame for neutral damage. Ice Beam gives Empoleon coverage to hit Dragon- and Grass-types such as Cyclizar, Noivern, and Amoonguss. Grass Knot hits Water-types like Basculegion-F and Slowbro while also giving it a means to damage Volcanion. Roost assures Empoleon can reliably recover throughout a game. Leftovers gives Empoleon even more longevity and offsets most entry hazard damage. Competitive is useful for getting a boost from Defog attempts, Intimidate Attack drops, and notably from Moonblast Special Attack drops, as Empoleon often switches into Gardevoir and Cresselia. Modest is used given Empoleon has great natural bulk without much investment, giving it more wallbreaking power without offsetting the defensive utility it has. The EV spread provided covers a few relevant defensive and offensive benchmarks. The defensive investments allow Empoleon to survive Hippowdon's Earthquake after taking Stealth Rock damage. Offensively, Empoleon threatens to 2HKO Assault Vest Cyclizar with Ice Beam after it takes Stealth Rock damage, 2HKO Slowbro with Grass Knot, and has a favorable roll to OHKO both Hippowdon and Palossand with Surf after 1 layer of Spikes. The Speed investment allows Empoleon to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt and Golurk. Tera Fairy flips its Fighting weakness into a resistance while also making Electric- and Ground-type attacks neutral, allowing Empoleon to stay in against Krookodile and Flygon if needed.</p> <p>Offensive Empoleon fits on balance and bulky offense teams, as it pivots into many of the special attackers in the tier and provides an immediate offensive response. Strong Fighting- and Ground-types like Rhyperior, Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mienshao appreciate Empoleon switching into Fairy- and Water-type attacks, namely from Basculegion-F and Gardevoir. Offensive Empoleon fits well on teams that can use alternative entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Jirachi so that it can maximize its offensive presence. Defensive teammates like Talonflame and Noivern can switch into to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while removing entry hazards and pivoting. Physical setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Mienshao, Revavroom, and Terrakion benefit from Empoleon being able to take on Slowbro and other bulky Water-types. Magnet Pull Magnezone can partner with Empoleon to trap and eliminate Steel-type Pokemon like opposing Empoleon and Jirachi, two of the better defensive checks to offensive Empoleon. Sticky Web setters like Araquanid and Galvantula can partner with and enable offensive Empoleon, as it outspeeds Adamant Overqwil, Adamant Revavroom, and Jolly Bisharp after they get slowed down.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Empoleon is among the best utility Pokemon in the metagame for its capacity to counter most special attackers, establish entry hazards, remove items, and phaze setup attempts. Roost allows Empoleon to remain healthy enough to switch in against the strong special attackers like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar multiple times throughout a game. Flip Turn can be used to gain switch momentum after switching into an attack, allowing teammates to position into whatever enters the field against Empoleon. Knock Off provides excellent utility in the form of item removal, namely Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing entry hazard damage to rack up as Empoleon forces multiple switches by absorbing attacks. Roar provides similar utility in accruing entry hazard damage while stopping setup attempts from the likes of Calm Mind Cresselia, Slowbro, and Reuniclus. Ice Beam gives Empoleon coverage to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types in the tier like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, and Noivern. Leftovers ensures Empoleon can recover off damage taken from entry hazards and switching into special attackers. Competitive gives Empoleon a needed Special Attack boost when activated by Moonblast drops from Cresselia and Gardevoir, Intimidate from Krookodile, and Defog from Talonflame and Noivern, making even bulky utility sets capable of outputting good damage. Being a Defog deterrent gives Empoleon an advantage in maintaining hazards, as the notable Defog users often struggle to deal with its coverage, especially after a boost from Competitive. A Calm nature with full investment in HP and Special Defense makes Empoleon seemingly impervious to damage from special attacks. Tera Fairy flips the critical weakness to Fighting into a resistance, allowing it to not be as threatened by the likes of Chesnaught, Mienshao, Galarian Zapdos, and Terrakion, while also flipping the Ground weakness into neutrality, making Krookodile and Flygon much less imposing. Tera Ghost similarly helps with the litany of Fighting-types prevalent in the metagame and gives Empoleon a valuable immunity to Rapid Spin attempts from the primary form of removal in Cyclizar.</p> <p>Empoleon is a staple on balance and bulky offense teams needing to shore up their matchups into the strong special attackers in the tier, a stalwart Steel-type that can establish entry hazards, and another form of item removal or phazing. With access to Roost, Empoleon has instant and reliable recovery, unlike other Steel-types like Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra. Choice Scarf Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar pose many problems for Fighting-type breakers like Galarian Zapdos, Terrakion, and Mienshao, making Empoleon an excellent choice to support them through defensive switch-ins and subsequent pivots with Flip Turn. Physically defensive teammates that can absorb Fighting- and Ground-type attacks from Krookodile, Mienshao, and Terrakion like Amoonguss, Cresselia and Chesnaught are excellent in creating cores that can cause issues for opposing teams, accumulating entry hazard damage and whittling teams down. Chesnaught benefits from Empoleon handling the main forms of removal in the metagame, such as Cyclizar with Ice Beam and Noivern and Talonflame due to Competitive, forming a strong defensive pairing that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and rack up hazard chip. Slower teammates such as Rhyperior and Crawdaunt that appreciate Empoleon's ability to sponge special attacks and safely pivot into them can assist in removing items and breaking teams through forcing multiple switches and hitting very hard into Empoleon checks like Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi. The combination of Water and Steel gives Empoleon favorable matchups into rain abusers like Basculegion-F and Kingdra, making physically defensive teammates like Amoonguss, Bellibolt, and Chesnaught, which also functions as a Knock Off absorber for Empoleon, valuable for their ability to switch into Barraskewda. Empoleon can gradually get worn down by hazard chip itself, making teammates that can pivot and maintain hazard control like Cyclizar and Noivern excellent partners.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon holds a place as one of the premier defensive Spikes setters in the tier. Its good natural bulk, coupled with a fantastic defensive typing that renders it weak only to a rare offensive type in the metagame, ensures that it can be very difficult to take down. Sticky Hold provides Gastrodon with further utility as one of the best Knock Off absorbers available, improving its matchup against Rapid Spin Cyclizar, which is the most common Pokemon in the tier. However, Gastrodon's mediocre attacking stats and lack of status spreading and disruption moves mean that it often struggles to punish setup sweepers like Calm Mind Slowbro and Suicune as well as Dragon Dance Gyarados for staying in. Despite Gastrodon's high HP stat, its low Defense stat leads to strong physical wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos, Golurk, and Crawdaunt often being able to take it down. Lastly, its Water / Ground typing's sole weakness comes into play as a vulnerability to Grass-type coverage attacks, including Energy Ball from Armarouge and Grass Knot from Empoleon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastrodon has the ability to set Stealth Rock on teams that lack other entry hazard setters; however, this is not optimal, as Gastrodon becomes passive after just one turn of setting up Stealth Rock, which can allow bulky wallbreakers and sweepers such as Basculegion-F and Calm Mind Slowbro to exploit it without fear of it setting up more hazards. Sludge Bomb is a decent coverage option over Ice Beam that similarly hits Grass-types like Chesnaught while possessing a useful chance to spread poison. Clear Smog is an option that can mitigate Gastrodon's general weakness to setup sweepers, though it can be neutralized by Covert Cloak or Substitute. Leftovers is an alternative defensive item that can improve Gastrodon's longevity. Covert Cloak can also be used to prevent Gastrodon from being affected by moves like Slowbro's Scald and Reuniclus's Psychic Noise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Calm Mind Sweepers</strong>: Bulky Calm Mind sweepers like Slowbro, Suicune, and Reuniclus take little damage from Gastrodon's attacks and can exploit it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: While there is a lack of offensive Grass-type Pokemon in RU, Amoonguss and certain special attackers with Grass-type coverage, such as Energy Ball Armarouge and Reuniclus as well as Grass Knot Empoleon, can threaten Gastrodon with significant damage. Niche picks like Hisuian Lilligant, Wood Hammer Mimikyu, and Tera Blast Grass Magnezone can also prove a challenge for Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: The strongest Choice Band wallbreakers in the tier, like Krookodile, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt, can threaten Gastrodon with massive damage, while they themselves don't fear staying in due to Gastrodon's weak offenses and lack of status moves.</p>",

Earthquake is used over Earth Power to deal more damage to common specially defensive Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Assault Vest Cyclizar. Ice Beam is very useful coverage that targets Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-type Pokemon that can switch in on Earthquake like Noivern, Flygon, and Chesnaught. Rocky Helmet punishes weak attacks from Pokemon like Cyclizar, Jirachi, and Chesnaught while pairing well with Sticky Hold. Heavy-Duty Boots can help keep Gastrodon healthy on teams lacking reliable entry hazard control. Sticky Hold is the preferred ability, as it enables Gastrodon to act as a Knock Off absorber at little cost to itself, with the additional utility of blocking Trick from Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Jirachi. Storm Drain alternatively lets Gastrodon answer threatening Water-types, like Volcanion and Barraskewda, as well as stop pivoting attempts by Flip Turn users like Basculegion-F and Empoleon. Tera Ghost provides Gastrodon with invaluable immunities to strong Fighting- and Normal-type attacks, including Galarian Zapdos's Close Combat and Maushold's Population Bomb, and allows it to spinblock Cyclizar. However, Tera Ghost Gastrodon's weakness to Knock Off from attackers like Krookodile and Mienshao can be very detrimental to it, especially if Sticky Hold is used, as Knock Off's power will always be boosted. Tera Poison is an alternative that provides Gastrodon with an immunity to Toxic from Umbreon and Poison Touch Alolan Muk, flips its weakness to Grass-type attacks like Giga Drain from Amoonguss, and offers resistances to Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-type attacks from offensive threats such as Mienshao and Mimikyu.</p> <p>Gastrodon fits best on balance teams that rely on stacking entry hazards to overwhelm the opposing team. Stealth Rock setters such as Jirachi, Registeel, and Krookodile are therefore important partners for Gastrodon. While Gastrodon itself is a reliable Cyclizar answer in these teams, it fails to prevent and punish common Defog users like Talonflame; hence, strong special attackers that can break through these defensive Pokemon, like Volcanion, Armarouge, and Reuniclus, as well as Defiant users that deter Defog, like Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos, can make for great assets to Gastrodon's team. Knock Off users such as Cyclizar, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos can further the hazard stacking gameplan by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Quagsire. Late-game cleaners, including the likes of Calm Mind Armarouge, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Choice Scarf Krookodile, can operate well in these teams, as they can eliminate many of the common Pokemon in the metagame after marginal chip damage from hazards. Gastrodon's vulnerability to special setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Slowbro, Suicune, and Reuniclus necessitates the presence of Pokemon with access to disruption moves like Encore Jirachi, Taunt Volcanion, and Trick + Choice Scarf Gardevoir that can prevent these sweepers from winning the game outright.</p>"

Its ample coverage also makes it difficult for defensive staples like Jirachi and Slowbro to handle it reliably. However, Lucario's poor bulk and mediocre initial power make it difficult to find setup opportunities, especially if it forgoes Air Balloon for Life Orb's extra power. It also struggles with an awkward Speed tier, causing it to rely heavily on Extreme Speed; as such, faster Ghost-types like Gengar and Mimikyu are able to revenge kill it with ease. Lucario also faces competition from other physical setup sweepers, especially those that have priority; Mimikyu has a better typing and defensive utility with Disguise, while Bisharp has superior bulk and power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lucario's solid Special Attack and wide special movepool makes a Nasty Plot set with Vacuum Wave a usable option. However, it faces stiff competition from other special setup sweepers, like Mew and Armarouge, while the lacking power of Vacuum Wave makes it less effective at revenge killing. A Choice Band set can be used for more immediate power while letting Lucario fit an extra attacking move. Justified can be used over Inner Focus in order to punish Knock Off from the likes of Cyclizar and Krookodile. Bullet Punch is significantly weaker than Extreme Speed but lets Lucario revenge kill Ghost-types like Mimikyu and Gengar, though both need to have been worn down to be KOed by the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Gligar have the bulk to take even a boosted hit from Lucario before retaliating with a super-effective STAB Move or, in the case of Hippowdon, force it out with Whirlwind. Quagsire is also able to completely ignore Lucario's Swords Dance boosts and KO it with Earthquake, though it is completely walled if Lucario's Air Balloon is intact.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Mimikyu are immune to Extreme Speed and naturally outspeed Lucario, letting them revenge kill it with their powerful attacks. Basculegion-F walls non-Crunch variants and can run Choice Scarf to outspeed and revenge kill Lucario. Additionally, Tera Ghost from defensive Pokemon like Registeel can prevent Lucario from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: If running Meteor Mash, Lucario is completely walled by Slowbro, which can cripple it with Thunder Wave or Scald burns. Hippowdon and Chesnaught are able to take even a boosted Close Combat from Lucario before KOing it with Earthquake and Body Press respectfully.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Talonflame can survive a non-Tera Normal Extreme Speed and punish Lucario with either Will-O-Wisp or Flame Body. Paralysis from Jirachi's Body Slam as well as Thunder Wave from the likes of Cresselia and Slowbro can also annoy Lucario, forcing it to rely more on Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Lucario is prone to being worn down by a combination of Life Orb recoil, Spikes, and Rocky Helmet held by defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon, Slowbro, and Hippowdon. When combined with its poor bulk, the residual damage leaves Lucario vulnerable to being picked off by even defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Cresselia.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lucario's access to the elusive combination of Swords Dance and Extreme Speed makes it a terrifying sweeper and revenge killer in the right circumstances. Meteor Mash serves as a powerful, if somewhat inaccurate, STAB move with the occasional Attack boost being a nice bonus that can further bolster Lucario's power. Crunch is a reliable coverage option that can be used to hit Psychic-types like Slowbro and Cresselia as well as Basculegion-F, which otherwise walls it. Life Orb further bolsters Lucario's power at the cost of gradually wearing it down throughout the game; after a Swords Dance, it enables Lucario to guarantee a OHKO on Volcanion and Jirachi with Close Combat as well as Nasty Plot Mew with Crunch after chip damage. Air Balloon can instead be used as a means to set up against Gastrodon, Hippowdon lacking Whirlwind, and Krookodile lacking Close Combat as well as momentarily taking on Mamoswine. It also provides Lucario temporary protection from Spikes and Sticky Web. Inner Focus is used to block Intimidate from Krookodile while also blocking flinches from Jirachi's Iron Head. Tera Normal bolsters Extreme Speed's power; with a Life Orb, this lets Lucario OHKO Galarian Zapdos and Noivern with the move after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Lucario provides offensive structures, particularly hyper offense teams, with a potent revenge killer and setup sweeper. Other physically offensive threats, like Gyarados, Mimikyu, and Maushold, can help Lucario wear down shared checks like Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Maushold in particular can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up, which is especially appreciated by Life Orb variants due to their tendency to get worn down. Life Orb Lucario also appreciates entry hazard setters with Taunt, such as Mew and Terrakion, as they can help wear down the opposing team with the entry hazards they set while preventing the opponent from getting hazards up. Lucario makes for a great partner with Armarouge due to its ability to take on the likes of Assault Vest Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon while also taking care of opposing priority users like Feraligatr with Extreme Speed. In return, Armarouge is able to exploit and eliminate physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Registeel. Other specially offensive threats like Gardevoir and Gengar can dent and possibly cripple the physical walls that Lucario struggles with while also appreciating Lucario's ability to take care of opposing revenge killers.</p>"

Hippowdon has the best raw physical bulk compared to other physical walls such as Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss. This bulk allows it to take neutral hits exceptionally well, making it a safe switch-in to unresisted moves like Terrakion’s Close Combat and Galarian Zapdos’s Brave Bird. As it is taking these hits, it is wearing foes  down through passive damage from the sand it summons. It also has many chances to switch in, giving it plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Hippowdon is the anchor for most balance teams in the tier, putting in work and making progress in basically every game. However, Hippowdon can struggle with particularly strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Mienshao or Galarian Zapdos because it does not resist their STAB attacks and struggles to take them effectively, and it is also vulnerable to passive damage such as entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Certain teams such as ones with Pokemon running Synthesis or that have teammates that dislike passive sandstorm chip such as Alolan Muk and Suicune would prefer Sand Force, effectively giving it no ability. Sand Force also makes it easier to Terastallize Hippowdon, since it doesn’t have to worry about its own sandstorm and has a better matchup into other Hippowdon due to its stronger Earthquake. Hippowdon can also run varying amounts of Special Defense in order to better match up against special attackers — for example, 140 Special Defense EVs to survive two Photon Geysers from Necrozma  — but Hippowdon often relies on maximum physical bulk to take neutral physical attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Mono-Earthquake Hippowdon is unable to hit Ground-immune foes at all, making Gyarados, Flygon, and Noivern incredibly safe switch-ins to it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Hippowdon with Stone Edge can hit Ground-immune foes but can't do any real damage to Grass-types such as Chesnaught.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Hippowdon's low Special Defense and reliance on Defense investment means it is vulnerable to special attacks even from uninvested attackers. Pokemon like Gengar and Gardevoir are attackers that Hippowdon does not want to switch in on, and bulky Pokemon with decent special damage such as Slowbro and Reuniclus are able to take Hippowdon's Earthquakes and threaten it in return.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers with Entry Hazard Support</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Band Krookodile, Terrakion, and Mienshao can overcome Hippowdon's raw physical bulk with the help of chip damage such as hazard support.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The tier is full of threatening physical attackers, and Hippowdon handles most of them with ease, switching into attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion, Kleavor, Krookodile, Maushold, and Bisharp. Hippowdon's sand provides passive damage and helps disarm other weather teams by removing their weather. Stealth Rock is the most common option, as Hippowdon makes a good setter due to its many chances to switch in and good matchup against Cyclizar, the tier's best spinner. Whirlwind gives Hippowdon the option to force out setup sweepers or rack up chip damage against foes trying to switch into Earthquake. Whirlwind is preferred over Roar due to Throat Chop Bisharp blocking the latter move. Stone Edge is a coverage option to hit Flying-types trying to switch into the normally passive Hippowdon, allowing it to turn the tables on matchups like Gyarados and Noivern. Stone Edge also helps to break Air Balloon on Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Gengar that try to turn Hippowdon into a setup opportunity. Rocky Helmet is the most common item due to its importance in dealing with Maushold, a Pokemon that can otherwise threaten to sweep teams on its own, while also providing chip damage against physical attackers. However, teams with other answers to Maushold or that don’t need the passive damage can instead run Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Tera Ghost is an all-around strong defensive type that blocks Rapid Spin from Cyclizar and allows Hippowdon to take on Terrakion even after a Swords Dance boost and Gallade. Tera Dragon removes Hippowdon's weaknesses to Grass and Water, being especially helpful against rain teams. Tera Poison gives Hippowdon a resistance to Grass, Fairy, and Fighting and makes Hippowdon immune to Toxic and able to absorb Toxic Spikes, being useful on teams that are otherwise weak to them.</p> <p>Hippowdon is common on bulky offense and balance teams. However, Hippowdon’s weaknesses must be accounted for in teambuilding, especially when considering the set it runs. Whirlwind Hippowdon needs to be paired with something that can handle Ground-immune Pokemon like Noivern, Gyarados, and Talonflame well. Assault Vest Cyclizar and Umbreon are two Pokemon that can switch into them. While Hippowdon is able to switch into strong Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion and Mienshao when fully healthy, it loses this resilience with even just a little bit of chip damage. Therefore, Hippowdon should be paired with a more sturdy Fighting resistant Pokemon such as Slowbro or Reuniclus. Hippowdon without Whirlwind may require extra support for setup sweepers. Revenge killers such as Galarian Zapdos, Entei, and Gengar can all fill this role. Non-Stealth Rock Hippowdon should be paired with another Stealth Rock setter such as Empoleon or Jirachi.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone is a dynamic Volt Switch user thanks to its Steel typing, which allows it to check foes like Gardevoir and Jirachi as well as threaten big damage on incoming Ground-types like Hippowdon and Krookodile with ease. Choice Specs + Analytic Magnezone is incredibly difficult for walls to check reliably, as it can threaten to 2HKO foes like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Registeel if they try to switch into an attack. With its natural bulk, Magnezone can opt to run defensive items like Assault Vest and Leftovers, allowing it to take more attacks in an attempt to pivot and wear the opposition down. As a great user of multiple Tera types, such as Fairy and Grass, Magnezone can pick and choose what walls it wants to break past, such as Umbreon and Gastrodon. Magnezone does struggle, however, to break through these common walls without Terastallization because of its lack of coverage moves. Magnezone also struggles to utilize Volt Switch at times, being prediction reliant against foes like Krookodile and Hippowdon that can come in and threaten it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnezone can use Iron Defense + Body Press sets to be an effective setup sweeper, especially in conjunction with Magnet Pull to trap foes like Klefki and Hisuian Goodra. Steel Beam is an alternative STAB attack that trades its health to blow through would-be checks like Cyclizar. Choice Scarf is a niche but effective item on Magnezone, allowing it to dish out massive damage to unsuspecting foes like Gengar. Air Balloon, and the more niche Magnet Rise, can enable IronPress sets to great effect, letting them take on foes like Krookodile and Mamoswine comfortably.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wo-Chien</strong>: Wo-Chien can comfortably take on Magnezone with its standard Leech Seed sets.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Gastrodon is a notable Magnezone counter, comfortably sponging its attacks and threatening to KO it back with Earthquake. Quagsire and Swampert are similar counters, though they're more niche and don't take it on quite as well. Offensive Ground-types force Magnezone to guess which attack to use, with threats like Krookodile punishing Volt Switch attempts.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Walls</strong>: Hisuian Goodra and Registeel are notable checks to most Magnezone sets, as Hisuian Goodra resists both of its STAB moves, and both of them comfortably sponge its attacks before threatening to hit it back with Flamethrower and Body Press, respectively. Bronzong is a niche pick that can similarly check Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou can use Magnezone as setup fodder or tank an attack from it before threatening it back with Aura Sphere or Scald. Opposing Magnezone can be problematic, as sets without Body Press or Tera Blast Ground struggle to make progress against the other. Rotom-H is a niche but effective VoltTurn member that can threaten an OHKO on Magnezone with its Overheat.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Magnezone is a high-voltage wallbreaker that takes advantage of the lack of special tanks in RU to blast holes in teams. Volt Switch lets it keep momentum flowing against switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra, Wo-Chien, and Umbreon. Tera Blast Grass targets Hippowdon, Tera Blast Ground hits opposing Magnezone, and Tera Blast Water helps against Entei. Analytic lets Flash Cannon OHKO Krookodile and gives it a chance to OHKO Hippowdon after Stealth Rock damage while also amping up Volt Switch to chip down switch-ins. Magnet Pull is used to trap Empoleon, Jirachi lacking U-turn, and Choice-locked Hisuian Goodra, enabling Magnezone to remove those checks for its teammates. Tera Grass lets Magnezone OHKO many Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon while resisting Ground-type moves like Earthquake, making it able to revenge kill Pokemon like Krookodile and Flygon. Tera Ground is useful on Magnet Pull sets to let it OHKO Hisuian Goodra, Bisharp, and opposing Magnezone. Tera Water is the more defensive Tera type, letting Magnezone resist Volcanion's STAB moves and Armarouge's Fire-type STAB moves and OHKO them back with Thunderbolt while still giving it a way to OHKO Ground-type switch-ins like Hippowdon.</p> <p>Magnezone fits well on balance and bulky offense teams and can be a strong member of a VoltTurn core alongside pivots like Cyclizar, Galarian Zapdos, and Noivern. Magnet Pull sets enable Dragon-type attackers like Hisuian Goodra and Fairy-type attackers like Gardevoir to fire off powerful attacks after the opponent's Steel-type check has been trapped and eliminated. Ground-immune Pokemon are natural pairings with Magnezone, as they are able to switch into Earthquake from Hippowdon and Krookodile. Galarian Zapdos, Noivern, and Talonflame fit that role and are also able to take resisted Fighting-type attacks from Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos for Magnezone. Defensive Grass-types, like Chesnaught and Wo-Chien, take little damage from Earthquake and can force out Ground-types. Cyclizar and Slowbro are able to switch into Fire-type attacks from Armarouge and Volcanion, which look to revenge kill Magnezone. Will-O-Wisp Talonflame, Scald Vaporeon, and Scald Slowbro can all threaten to burn physical attackers like Krookodile and Mienshao that threaten to OHKO Magnezone. Pivot partners like Noivern, Cyclizar, and Galarian Zapdos can use U-turn to let Magnezone safely enter the field and threaten checks like Hippowdon and Gardevoir. Ground-types like Krookodile and Hippowdon can set Stealth Rock to chip down checks to Magnezone like Umbreon and Wo-Chien, while Magnezone threatens Flying- and Water-types like Talonflame and Suicune. They also can switch into the Steel-types that wall Magnezone like Hisuian Goodra, threatening them out with Earthquake. Analytic Magnezone punches holes in defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Umbreon, and Chesnaught, allowing sweepers like Armarouge, Galarian Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Basculegion to clean up weakened teams.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Magnezone uses its typing that is filled with key resistances to keep in check many of RU's special attackers and walls, such as Gardevoir, Jirachi, and Slowbro, and turn them into opportunities to fire off its Analytic-boosted STAB moves. Discharge is chosen over Thunderbolt for the increased paralysis chance, as Magnezone will find many opportunities to enter the field and get a shot at paralyzing the foe. Body Press targets the would-be answers Hisuian Goodra, Chansey, and Assault Vest Cyclizar for a super effective hit on their weaker Defense stat; it is also coverage for opposing Magnezone. Tera Blast allows Magnezone to bait out and KO specific Pokemon that might otherwise cause trouble for its teammates. Tera Blast Flying hits Amoonguss and Wo-Chien, Tera Blast Water targets Armarouge, and Tera Blast Fairy nails the many Fighting- and Dragon-type Pokemon in the tier like Galarian Zapdos and Cyclizar. Mirror Coat can surprise Pokemon such as Armarouge and Focus Blast Gengar attacking into Magnezone to KO them back, though it is prediction-reliant. Analytic is used over Magnet Pull, since the Steel-types of the tier either ignore it thanks to their access to pivoting moves or by trading damage well against Magnezone, so the added damage given by Analytic is preferred. 84 Speed EVs are needed to outspeed Wo-Chien. 116 HP EVs coupled with 56 Special Defense EVs guarantees that Magnezone can take an Armor Cannon from Timid Armarouge and retaliate. Tera Flying turns Magnezone's Ground weakness into an immunity, so Magnezone can stay in against common foes with Ground-type coverage, such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, and Volcanion. It also turns its Fighting weakness into a resistance to retaliate against the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion and removes its Fire weakness to help out against Armarouge and Volcanion. Tera Water turns Magnezone into a sturdy switch-in to the Water- and Fire-type attackers of the tier such as Volcanion and Basculegion-F. Tera Fairy is a fantastic defensive typing that grants a resistance to Fighting-type attacks and, unlike Tera Flying, does not give a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Blast Fairy helps against key matchups such as Bisharp and Mienshao that carry moves that otherwise threaten Tera Flying Magnezone.</p> <p>Magnezone fits well on offense and balance teams looking for a Steel-type Pokemon with great offensive pressure and a pivoting option. It can also bait in key targets and, depending on the fourth move it picks, heavily weaken them and allow a teammate to wreak havoc after their check was taken care of by Magnezone. Examples of this include picking Body Press to hit Hisuian Goodra and help Armarouge getting past it or picking Tera Blast Fairy to KO Cyclizar, allowing Gengar to fire off strong Shadow Balls freely. A VoltTurn core can be formed with the likes of Noivern and Gligar, which can take the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks targeted at Magnezone; in return, Magnezone can handle their counters, such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Slowbro, respectively. Magnezone will often force Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon in to tank Volt Switch, so Fighting-type wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao appreciate having a free entry point and threaten those switch-ins. As a slow offensive Pokemon, Magnezone loves paralysis support from the likes of Thunder Wave Slowbro and Thunder Wave Gengar. Slowbro and Hippowdon are some of the sturdiest physical walls in the tier and help in providing a safe switch-in to physical wallbreakers, such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao, that can easily take out Magnezone. Armarouge and Volcanion are extremely dangerous Pokemon that also threaten Magnezone greatly, so Pokemon such as Umbreon, Hisuian Goodra, and Krookodile are great teammates that help play around those threats. Talonflame and Noivern both absorb Fighting- and Ground-type attacks for Magnezone and can use Defog to remove the Spikes that prevent Magnezone from entering the field to accomplish its pivoting role many times.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior is an excellent Pokemon, being able to set Stealth Rock, take hits, and deal damage in return. Rhyperior's typing and bulk allow it to stand up against many threats in the tier, including Entei, Mimikyu, and Maushold, while its powerful STAB EdgeQuake can overwhelm Pokemon like Bisharp, Jirachi, and Noivern. Rhyperior is a great Stealth Rock user due to how it threatens common entry hazard removal options like Cyclizar and Talonflame. Additionally, Swords Dance allows it to break through bulkier Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon. Rhyperior is a good user of Terastallization, as it can shed weaknesses it easily falters to, such as Water, Grass, Fighting, and Ground, and better handle threats that capitalize on its new Fairy and Dark weaknesses such as Mimikyu and Bisharp. However, Rhyperior has a 4x weakness to Water and Grass, meaning that—even though it carries Solid Rock—many attacks of these types like Scald, Steam Eruption, and Energy Ball are capable of OHKOing it. Rhyperior's poor Speed exacerbates this issue, as any Pokemon with the right moves can deal severe damage to it, ensuring it can easily be finished off later. Despite Rhyperior's strength, it struggles against common Pokemon like Slowbro and Chesnaught, both of which can easily heal its damage off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar and Dragon Tail can be used to prevent Pokemon like Hisuian Lilligant and Air Balloon Terrakion from setting up in front of Rhyperior. With 244 Speed EVs, Rhyperior can use Rock Polish to outspeed Gengar and Maushold, and if it opts for a Jolly nature, it can outpace Noivern and Talonflame as well, enabling it to sweep. Weakness Policy pairs well with Solid Rock and, combined with Rock Polish, can get Rhyperior to +2 Attack and Speed in a single turn. Choice Band's immediate power grants Rhyperior the ability to perform feats like 2HKOing Slowbro, although Rhyperior often prefers the flexibility of being able to switch up its moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Moves</strong>: With Rhyperior's 4x weakness, it cannot take any Grass-type attacks such as from Amoonguss's Giga Drain, Maushold's Bullet Seed, and Armarouge's Energy Ball. Chesnaught and Wo-Chien are also very capable of switching into Rhyperior's STAB attacks and threatening it with their own.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Volcanion, Empoleon, Crawdaunt, and Barraskewda all outspeed and threaten to OHKO Rhyperior with their powerful Water-type attacks. Bulky Pokemon like Slowbro and Gastrodon are able to comfortably survive Rhyperior's attacks and deal huge damage to it in return or heal themselves.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers like Gardevoir and Nasty Plot Mew deal enough damage to force their way through Rhyperior's weaker Special Defense. While Rhyperior can beat Pokemon like Armarouge and Magnezone, they still pose a significant threat, especially if Rhyperior takes chip damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rhyperior keeps Stealth Rock up over the course of a game with its powerful attacks that threaten entry hazard removers like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame. Swords Dance lets Rhyperior set up and threaten bulkier Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, while Megahorn can hit Psychic- and Grass-types like Slowbro and Wo-Chien. Leftovers provides passive recovery for Rhyperior, but Covert Cloak gives it an immunity to being flinched by Bisharp's and Jirachi's Iron Head as well as burned by Entei's Sacred Fire and, if Rhyperior has Terastallized out of its Water weakness, Slowbro's and Suicune's Scald too. Solid Rock weakens the damage from Rhyperior's many weaknesses, notably improving its matchup into Fighting-, Ground-, and Ice-types like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mamoswine. 60 Speed EVs allow Rhyperior to outspeed Hippowdon. Tera Dragon turns Rhyperior's 4x Water and Grass weaknesses into resistances in order to survive attacks from Crawdaunt, Gyarados, and Hisuian Lilligant. On the other hand, Tera Ghost gives Rhyperior an immunity to Fighting so that it can beat Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao while also preventing Cyclizar's Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Rhyperior fits most comfortably on balance and bulky offense teams. Due to its weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks from Volcanion and Armarouge, Rhyperior needs allies that can comfortably take these hits, such as Noivern, Cyclizar, and Empoleon. Spikes from Chesnaught and Klefki can help chip foes, like Slowbro and Hippowdon, into range of Rhyperior's attacks. Rhyperior's lower Special Defense means that it requires allies that can survive powerful special attacks from Gardevoir and Basculegion-F, such as Hisuian Goodra, Cyclizar, and Umbreon, the last of which can also provide healing support via Wish. Rhyperor is vulnerable to Spikes, so hazard removal from Rapid Spin Cyclizar and Defog Talonflame can allow it to enter the field safely. Special attackers like U-turn Noivern and Volt Switch Magnezone can threaten the physical walls that check Rhyperior like Hippowdon and Chesnaught while letting Rhyperior into battle against foes like Registeel and Hisuian Goodra.

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a distinguished threat in RU thanks to its fantastic offensive STAB combination pressuring defensive staples like Hippowdon, Rhyperior, Registeel, and Chesnaught. Its access to Ice Shard lets it easily pick off the many fast Ice-weak threats of the tier, including Cyclizar, Noivern, and Galarian Zapdos. The utility from Knock Off and Stealth Rock means Mamoswine is able to make efficient progress against checks to it like Slowbro and Suicune. However, Mamoswine's typing can be a liability defensively, as its many weaknesses leave it vulnerable to foes like Jirachi, Galarian Zapdos, and Basculegion-F. In addition, Mamoswine's solid HP is let down by its middling defensive stats, meaning it struggles to even stomach repeated neutral hits from attackers like Gardevoir, Krookodile, and Gengar. Although Ice Shard can compensate for Mamoswine's Speed, it's still outsped and threatened by foes like Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Mienshao. Mamoswine might be a great wallbreaker, but it still struggles to break one of the best walls in the tier, Slowbro, and it's also vulnerable to other Water-types like Feraligatr and Gyarados.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mamoswine can use Life Orb to wallbreak more effectively, but doing so risks exhausting it between entry hazard damage and recoil damage. An Adamant nature grants Mamoswine more power to break through walls like Hippowdon and Rhyperior more easily, but underspeeding Armarouge and opposing Mamoswine can put it in jeopardy. Loaded Dice + Icicle Spear allows Mamoswine to deal damage more reliably to Ground-resistant Pokemon like Talonflame. Trailblaze may seem tempting by letting Mamoswine function as a setup sweeper and hitting Water-types decently hard, but Ice Shard is already especially effective as an anti-offensive tool, and Mamoswine struggles to fit Trailblaze over any of its moves. A set with Focus Sash, Stealth Rock, and Endeavor can be used as a lead on hyper offense teams, though Mamoswine tends to be outclassed in this role by Terrakion and Kleavor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro soundly walls Mamoswine thanks to Slack Off and Regenerator, threatens it with Scald, and can even use it as setup fodder with Calm Mind. Vaporeon can heal off damage from Mamoswine with Wish. Suicune prefers not to take repeated hits from Earthquake, but it outspeeds and threatens to 2HKO Mamoswine. More offensive Water-types like Gyarados, Basculegion-F, and Barraskewda outspeed and threaten Mamoswine, though they don't switch into its attacks comfortably. Even Ground-weak Water-types like Volcanion and Empoleon deter Mamoswine from switching in with their STAB Water-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Quagsire, Cresselia, and Gastrodon are a pain for Mamoswine to break through on its own, especially if Mamoswine cannot Terastallize. Walls that would otherwise be easier for Mamoswine to break past such as Wo-Chien, Hippowdon, and Amoonguss can become major obstacles if they Terastallize and shed their weaknesses to its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Entei, Jirachi, and Terrakion all outspeed and threaten Mamoswine with their super effective STAB moves. Extreme Speed from the former and Sucker Punch from Bisharp also challenge Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: If Mamoswine opts to not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it's prone to being worn down by entry hazards into the ranges of being taken out by revenge killers like Gengar and Entei.

It's similarly useful for picking off frail threats like Maushold and Gengar and weakened out-of-control setup sweepers like Gyarados and Terrakion. Knock Off punishes switch-ins like Slowbro, Vaporeon, and Umbreon, softening them up and making them vulnerable to entry hazards and chip damage. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows Mamoswine to make progress even against physical walls like Slowbro and Cresselia. Heavy-Duty Boots is standard to give Mamoswine more opportunities to switch in repeatedly. Never-Melt Ice lets Mamoswine 2HKO Hippowdon with Icicle Crash and guarantees the OHKO on bulky Noivern with Ice Shard. Tera Fire grants a key burn immunity to Mamoswine so it can break down Talonflame without fear, and it lets Mamoswine tank Iron Head from Jirachi in a pinch. Tera Ice powers up Mamoswine's Ice-type moves to let it pull off feats like OHKOing Cyclizar with Ice Shard after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOing Gastrodon with Icicle Crash after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Mamoswine fits on balance and offensive teams as a threat that flexibly acts as a wallbreaker and revenge killer.

Offensive pivots like Jirachi and Galarian Zapdos can bring Mamoswine in safely with their pivoting moves, and those two in particular can draw in foes such as Hippowdon for Mamoswine to pressure. Slowbro and Cresselia may intercept Fighting-type attacks from threats like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion to relieve Mamoswine of its vulnerability to them. Water-types like Volcanion and Empoleon can check opposing Water-types that would pressure Mamoswine like Basculegion-F while physically defensive Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Chesnaught can handle more physically offensive Water-types like Feraligatr and Barraskewda for Mamoswine. Fast cleaners such as Gengar, Maushold, and Basculegion-F have an easier time becoming late-game threats thanks to the holes that Mamoswine creates as a wallbreaker, and they can compensate for its lower Speed. Entry hazard removal from teammates like Cyclizar and Talonflame lets Mamoswine more comfortably run Never-Melt Ice instead of Heavy-Duty Boots.

It threatens a plethora of common Pokemon such as Empoleon, Hippowdon, and Volcanion with its strong STAB combination that makes it very hard to respond to defensively. Ice Shard can pick off faster weakened threats such as Galarian Zapdos. Knock Off discourages switch-ins such as Talonflame and Slowbro from switching into Mamoswine for fear of losing their item. Tera Fire makes Mamoswine immune to Will-O-Wisp from foes like Talonflame. Tera Fire also removes Mamoswine's weaknesses to Fighting- and Steel-type moves from foes like Galarian Zapdos and Jirachi. Tera Ice enables Mamoswine to get a guarenteed OHKO on Talonflame with Icicle Crash and a guaranteed OHKO with Ice shard on targets like Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Choice Band Mamoswine commonly fits on bulky offense builds where these teams appreciate Mamoswine's ability to punish a wide range of defensive Pokemon. Galarian Zapdos is an effective partner for Mamoswine, as they form a core to overwhelm their shared checks such as Slowbro and Talonflame. Galarian Zapdos can also bring in Mamoswine safely via U-turn to pivot in on foes such as Hippowdon. Mamoswine does not like taking many hits, so it values pivot teammates like Noivern, Jirachi, and Empoleon to bring it in safely against Pokemon like Registeel and Empoleon. Mamoswine can get worn down easily by entry hazards, which hinders its ability to wallbreak, so it appreciates hazard removal from partners like Cyclizar and Talonflame. Mamoswine appreciates Stealth Rock from teammates such as Jirachi and Empoleon to enhance its wallbreaking potential, reaching feats like a 2HKO on Umbreon after Stealth Rock damage with Icicle Crash. Mamoswine values Healing Wish and Wish users like Gardevoir and Jirachi to come in more easily after taking some damage. Since Mamoswine is on the slower side, it also appreciates paralysis support through Body Slam from Jirachi, Thunder Wave from Reuniclus, and Thunder Wave from Slowbro to cripple faster Pokemon like Talonflame and opposing Jirachi. Mamoswine can have trouble breaking through checks such as Slowbro, so it appreciates strong special attackers such as Gengar and Raikou to break through it. In return, Mamoswine breaks through their checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Registeel. Mamoswine is vulnerable to faster Fighting- and Water-type threats like Galarian Zapdos and Choice Scarf Basculegion-F, so it appreciates switch-ins like Slowbro for the former and Hisuian Goodra for the latter.

    "overview": "<p>Glitching its way into SV RU, Porygon-Z acts as a niche, yet deadly, setup sweeper and wallbreaker. Its monstrous Special Attack stat combined with Download and Agility lets Porygon-Z clean up weakened teams, while its Normal typing lets it maintain a reliable STAB move with Tera Blast, even if it needs to Terastallize. Additionally, Porygon-Z's movepool includes several solid coverage options, such as Shadow Ball to nail Ghost-types and Jirachi as well as Thunderbolt to muscle through bulky Water-types like Empoleon and Volcanion. Porygon-Z is let down by its poor bulk and defensive typing, which make finding setup opportunities difficult due to the fact that it risks being dented by even defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon. Additionally, Porygon-Z's middling Speed tier leaves it outsped by common Pokemon, like Galarian Zapdos, Gengar, Jirachi, and Entei, without any Agility boosts; these factors mean that Porygon-Z's team must dedicate resources in order to facilitate a sweep. Porygon-Z also faces competition from more reliable setup sweepers; in particular, Armarouge has a stronger STAB combination and can boost its Speed without having to use a moveslot thanks to Weak Armor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon-Z can run a bulkier Agility set with 128 HP EVs alongside Recover, letting it stay on the field longer while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos at +2 Speed. However, its iffy natural bulk and poor defensive typing make other options like Calm Mind Reuniclus, Suicune, and Slowbro better choices for bulky setup sweepers. Nasty Plot can be used to further bolster Porygon-Z's already high Special Attack, letting it muscle through traditional checks like Umbreon, though its lacking Speed, leaving it outrun by threats like Krookodile and Mimikyu, makes it risky to use. A Double Dance set with both Nasty Plot and Agility is a usable option, though Porygon-Z struggles with the inability to fit coverage, especially if it does not Terastallize. Porygon-Z can opt to run a Choice item alongside Trick to cripple defensive Pokemon like Registeel and Blissey; Choice Specs lets it immediately punch holes through teams, while Choice Scarf patches up Porygon-Z's poor Speed stat without the need for Agility, notably letting it outspeed Choice Scarf Gardevoir and +1 Gyarados. Adaptability paired with Tri-Attack offers more consistent power than Download and Tera Blast, though the fact that Porygon-Z loses the power boost to Tri-Attack after Terastallization makes it unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they must be wary of Shadow Ball, Gengar, Basculegion-F, and Mimikyu are immune to Porygon-Z's Tera Blast and, thanks to its poor bulk, can heavily damage it with their secondary STAB attacks. Mimikyu in particular can take a hit with Disguise, using the opportunity to damage Porygon-Z with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Common Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra, Registeel, and Jirachi are able to switch in on Porygon-Z's attacks before taking the opportunity to KO it or, in the case of the latter two, cripple it with Thunder Wave. However, all three must be mindful of Tera Blast Ground or Fighting, with Jirachi needing to be wary of Shadow Ball as well. If Porygon-Z is not Tera Fighting, Bisharp can revenge kill it with Sucker Punch and take most of Porygon-Z's attacks, though it struggles to switch in reliably, especially if Porygon-Z is running Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Blissey is unable to be 2HKOed by Tera Blast Fighting Porygon-Z, even with a Download boost, letting Blissey wear it down with Seismic Toss or cripple it with Thunder Wave. Depending on Porygon-Z's Tera type, other special walls like Umbreon and Alolan Muk can also take it on.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Porygon-Z's poor bulk means that it only needs to sustain a little chip damage to be picked off by the tier's prominent priority moves, such as Extreme Speed from Entei, Accelerock or Sucker Punch from Lycanroc-D, and Aqua Jet from Feraligatr or Barraskewda.</p>",

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>An impressive Special Attack and good coverage land Porygon-Z a niche in RU as a ferocious wallbreaker and cleaner. Agility lets Porygon-Z outpace everything in the unboosted metagame, including Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Mienshao. Ice Beam nails Ground-types like Hippowdon, Flying-types like Galarian Zapdos, Grass-types like Wo-Chien, and Dragon-types like Cyclizar. Thunderbolt crushes Water-types like Suicune and Empoleon, while Shadow Ball slams Ghost-types like Gengar and Psychic-types like Jirachi. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Porygon-Z stay healthy in the face of entry hazards and also gives it an advantage against Sticky Web teams. Download potentially nets Porygon-Z a Special Attack boost against physically defensive foes such as Slowbro, which it can OHKO with Thunderbolt at +1, and Chesnaught that it scares out, making it more difficult for opposing walls to deal with Porygon-Z. Tera Ground lets Porygon-Z eviscerate Steel-types like Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra with Tera Blast. Tera Fighting still lets Tera Blast hit Steel-types while also letting Porygon-Z blow Umbreon up. Tera Fighting also grants a crucial resistance to Sucker Punch from Bisharp.</p> <p>Porygon-Z is best used as a wallbreaker and cleaner on offensive teams. Other special wallbreakers like Calm Mind Armarouge, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra can help Porygon-Z sweep by softening up special walls such as Umbreon, Empoleon, and opposing Jirachi. As Porygon-Z struggles to hit the field on its own due to its frailty, it appreciates pivots like Galarian Zapdos and Flygon baiting in physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon for it to take advantage of. Entry hazards set by teammates like Terrakion, Chesnaught, and Krookodile help in wearing down Porygon-Z's checks like the aforementioned special walls. Knock Off users like Galarian Zapdos and Crawdaunt remove items like Assault Vest and Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, making it easier for Porygon-Z to clean up lategame. Porygon-Z is easily taken down by priority attacks such as Extreme Speed from Entei and Sucker Punch from Bisharp; thus, teammates that can take these threats on like Galarian Zapdos and Talonflame are useful partners for it. Porygon-Z is most effective when it uses Terastallization; hence, teammates that don't rely on the mechanic to be threatening, like Gardevoir and Basculegion-F, are helpful partners, which can also help pressure defensive foes like Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra. Status support like Thunder Wave from Slowbro, Will-O-Wisp from Talonflame, and Thunder Wave Reuniclus can give Porygon-Z more opportunities to set up and sweep by weakening foes.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gallade is a very threatening wallbreaker that uses its Sharpness-boosted offensive coverage options to threaten big damage on most of the metagame. It can notably 2HKO walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Chesnaught, making it an excellent tool at dealing with defensive teams in particular, as nothing can reliably take its hits. It is, however, held back by its average bulk. While its special bulk can let it tank some pretty big hits like Gengar's Shadow Ball, Volcanion's Steam Eruption, and Magnezone's Discharge, its physical bulk is terrible, and it will have trouble taking hits it doesn't resist from any mildly threatening foes such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Mamoswine's Earthquake. Its biggest weakness is its mediocre Speed leaving it vulnerable to revenge killing attempts from faster threats like Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Noivern; Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir; and priority users like Mimikyu and Bisharp. It therefore struggles against more offensive teams containing more of these fast threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off or Night Slash can be used over Leaf Blade to hit bulky Psychic-types, notably Armarouge, harder. Night Slash has consistently high damage and good synergy with Scope Lens thanks to its higher critical chance. Knock Off hits for slightly less and only gets its boosted Base Power once, resulting in it being less effective against the likes of Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Cresselia, but it has the upside of removing items like Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Armarouge</strong>: Armarouge's good bulk, unique typing that resists both of Gallade's STAB moves and Leaf Blade, high damage, and Weak Armor ability make it an effective check that can use Gallade as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Faster wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Maushold can threaten Gallade prior to it using Agility, while Choice Scarf users like Gengar are still faster than +2 Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: As a setup sweeper with mediocre Defense, Gallade is especially weak to priority moves; it's weak to Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and neutral to Sucker Punch and Aqua Jet from the likes of Crawdaunt and Bisharp, which can easily revenge kill it. While Extreme Speed and Ice Shard from Entei and Mamoswine hit it hard, it can, in a pinch, use Tera Steel to take less damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gallade has a unique niche in being a wallbreaker that threatens a 2HKO on the main physical walls of the tier such as Chesnaught and Slowbro. Psycho Cut not making contact comes in handy against Rocky Helmet users and Flame Body Pokemon, like Hippowdon and Talonflame. Leaf Blade is useful coverage for hitting bulky Water- and Ground-types that could wall Gallade otherwise such as Slowbro and Hippowdon. With Swords Dance, Gallade gets the opportunity to OHKO most physical walls in the tier like Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Slowbro, while Agility allows it to outspeed foes that would normally revenge kill it like Galarian Zapdos, Gengar, and Gardevoir. Lum Berry allows it to shrug off status effects that can be inflicted by Slowbro, Talonflame, and Quagsire; it works best on Swords Dance sets, as they don't need more damage. Life Orb is an alternative that fits the most on Agility variants, as it adds damage that can be lacking, letting them OHKO some notable threats like Gardevoir after Stealth Rock. Scope Lens is another option to get additional damage on Agility sets; it is less reliable than Life Orb but crucially doesn't cause recoil, which can help Gallade to tank important hits such as Earthquake from Krookodile and Steam Eruption from Volcanion. It can also let Gallade break through Terastilized Iron Defense setup sweepers such as Tera Ghost Registeel. Tera Steel is at its best on Swords Dance sets, letting Gallade sponge hits from Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Alolan Ninetales extremely well while also letting it beat Choice-locked Galarian Zapdos. Since Agility sets have less issue with these threats and much prefer an offensive item over Lum Berry, Tera Fire is preferred to absorb burns from Talonflame.</p> <p>Gallade is a huge threat on Sticky Web and bulky offense teams, as it's able to dig holes in the opponent's defensive structure and can take advantage of paralysis and Sticky Web to fix its speed issue. Because of its average bulk, it also loves pivots, thus working well with allies such as Jirachi, Raikou, and Galarian Zapdos; Jirachi can also spread paralysis to allow it to outpace foes like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Gardevoir. Raikou likes Gallade being able to threaten the common Ground-types that can KO it, and Galarian Zapdos benefits from Gallade's wallbreaking potential, helping it find an opening to clean a weakened team. However, they're all weak to Armarouge, so priority moves from the likes of Entei and Bisharp or bulky allies that resist Armor Cannon such as Volcanion, Noivern, and Cyclizar may be needed. On teams utilizing Ribombee's Sticky Web, Gallade will need to be heavily supported, as it is quite weak to some already difficult foes to deal with for Sticky Web teams like Galarian Zapdos, Bisharp, and Armarouge. One particularly great ally is Low Kick Bisharp, which can consistently beat opposing Bisharp and revenge kill Armarouge. Calm Mind + Heavy-Duty Boots Armarouge is a great Galarian Zapdos revenge killer, as it can survive a hit and enable Weak Armor while also being a threatening sweeper on its own; it may also force a special wall in, which is perfect to give Gallade an opportunity to set up. Teams stacking multiple physical setup sweepers such as Bisharp, Mimikyu, and Maushold appreciate Swords Dance Gallade's ability to help wear down shared checks like Quagsire and Hippowdon. Agility Gallade benefits most from other wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Crawdaunt, and Galarian Zapdos thanks to their ability to weaken physical walls, letting it clean a weakened team. After using Agility, it can outspeed most Choice Scarf users aside from Gengar, helping it clean teams relying on the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir for speed control. Entry hazard support such as Stealth Rock or Spikes can help greatly with putting foes such as Gardevoir or Volcanion in KO range of Gallade's attacks.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band Gallade can act as an extremely powerful wallbreaker with its Sharpness-boosted STAB moves. Leaf Blade targets Water- and Ground-types like Slowbro and Hippowdon. Knock Off provides utility by removing items from possible switch-ins like Hippowdon and Slowbro, and it hits Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Cresselia. Shadow Sneak lets it revenge kill weakened Armarouge, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Trick can cripple walls like Reuniclus, and removing Gallade's Choice item can help ease prediction against teams with multiple Pokemon resistant to its STAB moves. Tera Steel lets it flip the matchup against Flying- and Fairy-types like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir, while Tera Dark boosts Knock Off, guaranteeing a 2HKO on Slowbro; helps answer Ghost-types like Gengar as well as Psychic-types; and provides a resistance to Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Choice Band Gallade often finds itself on balance and bulky offense teams that can patch up its physical frailty and mediocre Speed while appreciating its ability to punch holes through defensive cores. Cleaners like Galarian Zapdos, Maushold, and Armarouge can sweep teams after Gallade has weakened shared checks like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Due to Gallade having the coverage to 2HKO any Pokemon in the tier, no slower Pokemon want to stay in on it, letting it effectively force switches; this synergizes well with entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Klefki, and Krookodile, since their hazards can help chip down the opposing team and make Gallade less reliant on prediction. If Gallade is running Shadow Sneak over Knock Off, answers to bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Reuniclus are necessary. Bisharp and Encore Jirachi can help alleviate this weakness. Pivots like Cyclizar and Raikou can help bring Gallade onto the field safely after inviting in Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra. Paralysis support from the likes of Jirachi, Slowbro, and Klefki can make Gallade a terrifying foe by crippling its faster checks, like Talonflame and Suicune, making them unable to outspeed it. Gallade should be paired with defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Empoleon, and Umbreon that can switch into revenge kill attempts from the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Talonflame.</p>"

Trick can cripple walls such as Suicune, Cresselia, and Calm Mind Reuniclus. Tera Steel changes Gallade's Fairy and Flying weaknesses into resistances, which helps it tank hits from Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Dark boosts Knock Off damage, guaranteeing a 2HKO on Reuniclus as well as providing a very high chance to OHKO Armarouge, and it gives Galladea resistance to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Gengar and Bisharp.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Gallade performs best on balance and bulky offense structures, as they can help weaken its checks. Stealth Rock users like Hippowdon can help weaken Gallade's checks throughout the match to allow it to eventually clean late-game,and it can switch into Pokemon that threaten Gallade out like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Mimikyu; Spikes setters like Chesnaught and Gastrodon can fulfill a similar role. These Pokemon appreciate Gallade's Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the opposing team. Wallbreakers such as Krookodile and Mamoswine can help weaken physical walls that Gallade struggles with such as Reuniclus and Hippowdon. Armarouge answers like Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra are necessary, as Armarouge can use Gallade as setup fodder if it locks into an attack that Armarouge resists. Gallade appreciates pivot support and hazard removal from the likes of Jirachi and Cyclizar, allowing it to enter the field easily and leverage its useful special bulk more consistently.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Froslass is one of the many viable leads of RU due to its good Speed stat and access to Spikes and Taunt. Froslass can be powerful against slower teams, as they may have trouble stopping it from setting Spikes. Spikes allows offensive teammates, such as Bisharp and Armarouge, to more easily break through slower Pokemon like Hippowdon, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra. 100 Attack EVs let Froslass OHKO Cyclizar with Triple Axel or Avalanche. Avalanche works best with Destiny Bond, allowing Froslass to attack with negative priority the turn after using Destiny Bond to force a slower threat to hit it while Destiny Bond is still active; however, Avalanche's negative priority means it is easier to deal direct damage when using Triple Axel. Will-O-Wisp is useful to cripple opponents who may want to lead against it such as Barraskewda, Mamoswine, and Bisharp. Destiny Bond allows Froslass to trade with threats that would otherwise ignore Will-O-Wisp and Triple-Axel such as Volcanion, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra and works best alongside Avalanche. Taunt is a powerful tool to stop slower foes such as Empoleon and Krookodile from setting entry hazards and deny setup moves from threats such as Bisharp and Armarouge. Tera Steel is chosen to help against foes such as Kleavor and Terrakion; however, Terastallizing Froslass instead of other teammates should not be necessary outside of emergencies because it doesn't mind getting KOed early.</p> <p>As a dedicated lead, Froslass fits exclusively on hyper offense teams, which benefit the most from dedicating a slot to reliably setting entry hazards while stopping the opponent from placing their own. As Spikes can be easily removed, a spinblocker such as Mimikyu or Colbur Berry Golurk can prove useful, with the latter also helping stack even more hazards for further chip damage. Specially offensive teammates such as Armarouge and Gengar can come in for free on Talonflames's Defog and take advantage of Spikes to better deal with special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Bisharp works well to punish Defog, but its weakness to Will-O-Wisp can make switching in on Talonflame dangerous. Pokemon such as Gyarados and Armarouge that would normally run Heavy-Duty Boots also benefit greatly from Froslass denying the opponent from setting up Stealth Rock, as it allows them to run items such as Lum Berry, Throat Spray, and Weakness Policy, respectively.</p>"

However, Rotom-H lacks recovery outside of Pain Split, making it prone to getting worn down throughout a game or brute-forced through by strong attackers like Armarouge. Additionally, Rotom-H's Stealth Rock weakness leaves it vulnerable to Knock Off, preventing it from effectively checking Krookodile and Mamoswine.

Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster Pokemon like Cyclizar and Galarian Zapdos, letting faster teammates outspeed them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Cyclizar can switch into Rotom-H's attacks before removing its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and/or forcing a boosted Rotom-H out with Dragon Tail.

    "overview": "<p>In a tier with few offensive Grass-types, Rotom-C carves out a niche for itself as a pivot that can threaten defensive staples such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Empoleon. Thanks to its Grass typing, Rotom-C's Volt Switch is very difficult to block, as Ground-types like Rhyperior and Krookodile are OHKOed by Leaf Storm. Rotom-C also sets itself apart from other Electric-types thanks to Levitate as well as its resistance to Water-type attacks, letting it take on Gastrodon and switch into Suicune. This is complemented by its access to Nasty Plot, letting it act as a potent wallbreaker that can bust through typical checks like Registeel and Umbreon. Rotom-C is capable of providing solid utility for its team thanks to options like Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave. However, its Grass typing is a double-edged sword; not only is it weak to common attackers like Armarouge and Gengar, but offensively, its typing also leaves it unable to deal damage to Dragon- and Grass-types like Hisuian Goodra, Cyclizar, and Wo-Chien respectively. Additionally, Rotom-C's awkward Speed tier leaves Choice Scarf sets outsped by other common Choice Scarf users like Gengar and Galarian Zapdos. Rotom-C also directly competes with the tier's other Electric-types, especially given its lack of resistance to Flying-type attacks from the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Noivern; Magnezone provides more raw power and a better defensive typing, while Raikou can act as a more powerful and bulkier pivot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used to trade Speed for power, letting Rotom-C punish foes like Registeel harder while pivoting. However, Nasty Plot is largely more consistent at wallbreaking, and Raikou and Magnezone generally outclass it as an Electric-type Choice Specs pivot. Tera Water can be used to turn Rotom-C's Fire weakness into a resistance, letting it check Volcanion in a pinch. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt in order to fish for paralysis against switch-ins like Cyclizar, though it becomes less likely to 2HKO Noivern and, after a Nasty Plot Boost, Cresselia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra can comfortably take Rotom-C's attacks due to its lacking coverage, letting them freely remove entry hazards or KO it with Draco Meteor, respectively. However, both must be wary of being statused or given a Choice Scarf via Trick. While they don't like taking a Volt Switch or Thunderbolt, Noivern has a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm and can wear Rotom-C down with its powerful attacks. However, Rotom-C can simply use Volt Switch to pivot out against them and its other defensive checks as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Wo-Chien completely walls Rotom-C and is able to wear it down with Ruination and Knock Off. Pain Split Rotom-C can eventually beat it one-on-one, but it becomes significantly weakened afterwards. Similarly, Chesnaught can safely switch into Rotom-C's attacks, heal off any damage with Synthesis, and freely set up Spikes. However, neither like being burned nor being given a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon, like Umbreon and Blissey, can shrug off Rotom-C's attacks and heal off the damage, all while wearing it down with Toxic for the former and Seismic Toss for the latter. They both must be wary of Trick, however, while Umbreon can be muscled through by Nasty Plot variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Rotom-C's middling Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users, such as Galarian Zapdos, Terrakion, and Gengar. Boosted Bisharp can take it out with Sucker Punch; however, it must be mindful of Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

Rotom-C's Volt Switches are rather difficult to block, as Electric-immune Pokemon like Rhyperior and Hippowdon are decimated by Leaf Storm. It should be noted that Choice-locked Rotom-C is rather reliant on predictions and coinflips, as many teams have both a Volt Switch blocker and a bulky Grass-resistant Pokemon. Trick helps ease Choice Scarf Rotom-C's prediction-heavy nature, in addition to letting it cripple specially defensive Pokemon that would otherwise check it, like Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra, making them easier for teammates to deal with. Rotom-C's last moveslot is fairly flexible depending on what its team needs. Thunderbolt lets it reliably target Electric-weak targets like Volcanion and Gyarados without switching out while also making it easier to revenge kill neutral targets like Jirachi and non-Choice Scarf Gengar.

Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's most powerful STAB option, threatening Electric-resistant or -immune Pokemon like Raikou and Rhyperior while also KOing Gardevoir after Stealth Rock damage and a Nasty Plot boost. Thunderbolt acts as a spammable STAB move that doesn't remove Rotom-C's accumulated boosts unlike Leaf Storm or Volt Switch. However, it leaves Rotom-C walled by the likes of Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Wo-Chien. As such, Volt Switch can be used instead to pivot out of unfavorable matchups while also accumulating valuable chip damage. Pain Split lets Rotom-C stay healthy, especially against bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Wo-Chien, potentially allowing it to beat them one-on-one. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster threats such as Noivern, Maushold, and Jirachi while also crippling one of Rotom-C's biggest checks, Cyclizar; however, Cyclizar gains a slow U-turn that can be used against it while still allowing Cyclizar to comfortably switch into Rotom-C, so the move can't be used to beat it one-on-one. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Bisharp and Gallade on the switch, leaving them open to being walled by Rotom-C's teammates. Tera Steel allows it to avoid Toxic from the likes of Umbreon, Amoonguss, and Quagsire while also being a generally good defensive typing paired with Rotom-C's Levitate; this lets it check offensive threats such as Gardevoir and Mamoswine in a pinch.</p> <p>Rotom-C is great on balance and bulky offense teams, using its unique defensive profile to repeatedly switch in and pressure the opponent. If it opts to use Volt Switch, it can even act as a pivot to bring in big threats such as Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mamoswine. Galarian Zapdos is a particularly good partner, as it can chain its U-turn with Rotom-C's Volt Switch, putting immense pressure on the opponent, especially with entry hazards in the picture. Other good partners include Mienshao and Barraskewda, which can use U-turn and Flip Turn, respectively, to bring in Rotom-C against Hippowdon and Slowbro. Spikes users such as Gastrodon and Klefki are excellent complements to Rotom-C, which greatly appreciates checks like Hisuian Goodra and Chansey being worn down by Spikes, especially if it's running Volt Switch. If Rotom-C opts to run Thunder Wave, it can pair up with other special attackers such as Volcanion, Gengar, and Basculegion-F that enjoy facing a crippled Cyclizar. All of them also invite in Hisuian Goodra, making for fierce pairings that pressure and wear it down. Slowbro makes for a nice partner due to its ability to check the various threats that Rotom-C invites in, particularly Entei and Jirachi. In return, Rotom-C can pivot to Slowbro with Volt Switch while also checking Raikou and bulky Water-types like Empoleon and Suicune.</p>"

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>Azelf's good Speed, good coverage, bevy of utility moves, and access to Nasty Plot carve it several modest niches as an offensive threat and lead. Azelf is one of the only relevant leads that can compress all of Stealth Rock, Taunt, and pivoting with Explosion onto one set, while opposing leads, such as Terrakion and Kleavor, are slower than Azelf and let it set up its entry hazards or deter their hazards freely. Even fast offensive Pokemon like Jirachi, Gengar, and Maushold are all prone to being outsped by Azelf, and Choice Scarf or boosted variants of them are still vulnerable to Azelf's Choice Scarf set. However, Azelf is unfortunately outsped by metagame staples like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Barraskewda, and its poor bulk is a major liability against Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile if Azelf isn't holding a Choice Scarf itself. Bulky Steel-types like Jirachi, Bisharp, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon are all common and turn Azelf into a momentum sink, while Krookodile and Entei are common revenge killers that inhibit Azelf from cleaning effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Azelf has Nasty Plot, its poor bulk leaves it both struggling to set up safely and easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile, priority users like Entei and Bisharp, and faster metagame staples like Cyclizar and Noivern. Psychic Noise can be considered instead of Psychic and Psyshock on offensive sets to inhibit walls like Jirachi, Empoleon, and Vaporeon. Psyshock hits specially bulky foes like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Blissey harder. Encore disrupts slower setup users like Bisharp, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Reuniclus, and it similarly puts defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon, Empoleon, and Slowbro into bad positions. However, Azelf both struggles to find room for Encore and leverage its poor bulk well enough to use it safely. Thunder Wave hinders Cyclizar and faster Pokemon like Talonflame and Noivern, which can let Azelf outspeed them and effectively use Taunt to stop them from using Defog. A mixed offensive set, choosing from moves like Drain Punch, Knock Off, and U-turn, can allow Azelf to deal with Pokemon that would normally check it such as Assault Vest Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon while retaining the ability to deal decent damage to physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro with special attacks. A Choice Scarf set occupies a niche in being able to outspeed and revenge kill common opposing Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir as well as sweepers like +1 Speed Gyarados, though Azelf's lack of power means it usually requires some chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: All Steel-types must be wary of Azelf's Fire-type coverage moves, but ones like Bisharp and Assault Vest Magnezone can generally tank a hit and KO Azelf in return. Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Registeel shrug off hits from Azelf, and the first even has reliable recovery. Jirachi's defensive sets have Protect + Wish and Serene Grace + Body Slam to ease their matchups against Azelf.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Umbreon easily tanks Azelf's attacks, heals off any damage with Wish, has Protect to block Explosion, and OHKOes Azelf with Foul Play, but it is vulnerable to Taunt. Krookodile can't stomach Azelf's coverage moves, but Choice Scarf sets can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Azelf reliably. Wo-Chien has the bulk to survive any of Azelf's coverage moves and hit it back hard with Knock Off and Foul Play, though it takes a ton of damage from U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Strong Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F, Gengar, Krookodile, and Kleavor can reliably outspeed Azelf and OHKO it with their super effective attacks. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can tank two attacks from most Azelf sets and 2HKO it with Moonblast. Bisharp and Mimiyku hit Azelf hard with their super effective priority, and other priority users like Entei and Crawdaunt can pick off Azelf when it's weakened. Noivern requires little chip damage to reliably OHKO it with Draco Meteor, and Cyclizar can tank its hits repeatedly while threatening to 2HKO it with Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Azelf is the fastest relevant Stealth Rock and Taunt user in the metagame, giving it the edge against some opposing entry hazard leads like Terrakion. Additionally, Taunt prevents Defog users like Talonflame from removing Azelf's hazards. Explosion gets Azelf off the field quickly, letting a teammate take over and put the free switch to good use; breaks Focus Sash on opposing leads like Terrakion; and prevents moves like Rapid Spin, Defog, and Kleavor's Stone Axe and Trailblaze from succeeding. Flamethrower chunks down Bisharp, Magnezone, and Klefki, and it chips other Steel-types like Jirachi and Registeel looking to tank Explosion. Endeavor weaponizes Azelf's poor bulk and brings foes to extremely low HP once it has been brought down to its Focus Sash. Drain Punch 2HKOes Cyclizar and Bisharp to deter them from switching in, and it also 2HKOes Terrakion. Although Levitate is Azelf's only ability, the Ground immunity it provides is a perk against Hippowdon and its Focus Sash-breaking Sand Stream, especially if it isn't running Stone Edge. Azelf should run a Naive nature if it carries Flamethrower. Tera Ghost is used to spinblock Cyclizar, though Azelf should rarely Terastallize due to the value Terastallization brings to its teammates.</p> <p>Lead Azelf is used on hyper offense teams to start off games at a quick tempo and control the entry hazard situation of a battle. Setup sweepers like Armarouge, Bisharp, and Gyarados appreciate the free switch they receive from Azelf's Explosion. Moxie sweepers like Krookodile and Gyarados can especially take advantage of the chip damage done by Explosion. Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin to preserve Azelf's Stealth Rock, and it notably checks Cyclizar and Maushold. Similarly, Bisharp can punish Defog users like Noivern. Rock-weak Pokemon, including Armarouge and Gyarados, benefit from Azelf's ability to deny Stealth Rock, as they then have the flexibility to run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Azelf's good Special Attack and Speed make it a niche fast special attacker. Mystical Power can let Azelf snowball and punish Pokemon sacrifices, but Psychic offers more immediate power for wallbreaking and securing KOes so Azelf doesn't take retaliatory hits. For example, Psychic notably OHKOes uninvested Galarian Zapdos. Draining Kiss keeps Azelf healthy while offsetting the recoil damage from Life Orb. However, Dazzling Gleam is more immediately powerful against Cyclizar and threatening Dark-types like Krookodile, and it doesn't make Azelf as reliant on Terastallization. Flamethrower dispatches Steel-types like Bisharp, Registeel, and Magnezone that could otherwise wall Azelf. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Flamethrower that nails Armarouge and other Psychic-types like Slowbro and Reuniclus. Azelf can capitalize on switches it forces against Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos locked into not very effective moves, setting up Nasty Plot and tearing through defensive cores. At +2, Life Orb Azelf can OHKO Registeel with Flamethrower, Slowbro with Shadow Ball, and Hippowdon with Psychic. Since Azelf's poor bulk limits its actual opportunities to set up, Thunderbolt is a decent alternative that nails Empoleon and other Water-types like Slowbro, Volcanion, and Suicune. Expert Belt emphasizes Azelf's excellent offensive coverage against defensive staples like Slowbro, Jirachi, and Cyclizar. Life Orb improves Azelf's damage output against neutral targets like Mamoswine, secures 2HKOes against Hippowdon and Rhyperior, and powers up coverage moves to better threaten Hisuian Goodra. Tera Fairy and Tera Fire both provides Azelf a boost to one of its coverage moves. Tera Fairy helps against Sucker Punch users like Bisharp, Knock Off users like Cyclizar, and U-turn users like Mienshao, and, with the boost from Tera Fairy, Life Orb Dazzling Gleam 2HKOes Umbreon. Tera Fire gives Azelf a neat resistance to Mamoswine's Ice Shard while carrying over Tera Fairy's Bug resistance to deal with U-turn, and it powers up Flamethrower to melt Hisuian Goodra and Registeel.</p> <p>Azelf primarily fits on fast-paced offensive teams that keep up a fast tempo with pivots like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Magnezone. Azelf's poor bulk means it appreciates these pivots bringing it in safely. Physical wallbreakers like Krookodile, Mamoswine, and Bisharp threaten special walls like Cyclizar and Empoleon, while Azelf can overwhelm physical walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Chesnaught. Similarly, Mimikyu can deal with revenge killers like Cyclizar and Noivern, while Azelf pressures problematic Poison-types like Amoonguss. Galarian Zapdos checks Dark-types like Krookodile and Bisharp and pressures Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon for Azelf, and Azelf's frailty is mitigated by the free switches Galarian Zapdos provides with U-turn. Moxie sweepers like Gyarados and Choice Scarf Krookodile can more easily get the ball rolling against teams Azelf has weakened. Special attacking cleaners like Gardevoir, Raikou, and Basculegion-F can more easily sweep thanks to the holes Azelf makes in special walls like Cyclizar and Jirachi during the mid-game. Entry hazard removal from Maushold, Cyclizar, and Talonflame helps Azelf remain healthy enough to stay out of range of revenge killers like Noivern and opposing Cyclizar. Azelf enjoys hazards wearing its foes down, opening it up to OHKO Magnezone with Flamethrower after one layer of Spikes, so hazard setters like Gligar, Chesnaught, and Klefki can enable Azelf. Azelf's frailty leaves it easily revenge killed, so bulky Pokemon that can switch into revenge killers are a big help. (AP) Slowbro and Gastrodon handle Galarian Zapdos; Hippowdon and Chesnaught deal with Bisharp; and Empoleon and Hisuian Goodra manage specially offensive revenge killers like Gardevoir and Choice Scarf Basculegion-F.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia's obscene bulk and colorful movepool make it a versatile wall in the metagame. It can act as either a hard-to-kill setup sweeper with Calm Mind and Moonlight or a supporting teammate that can paralyze Pokemon that try to set up on it, like Gyarados. Cresselia's exclusive access to Lunar Dance lets it fully heal and even cure teammates such as Galarian Zapdos, Basculegion-F, and Bisharp of status so that they can continue to break walls. Additionally, Cresselia has solid coverage in Ice Beam and Moonblast, threatening slower Pokemon like Hippowdon and Crawdaunt. However, Cresselia's mono-Psychic typing is underwhelming defensively, leaving it weak to common attackers like Gengar and Krookodile while offering few notable resistances in return. This means that Cresselia is often forced to Terastallize in order to wall threats effectively. Additionally, its Special Attack is rather pitiful, forcing Calm Mind sets to accumulate several boosts in order to break through defensive Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Slowbro; as such, it is often crippled by disruption such as Trick or Encore from Jirachi as well as Taunt from the likes of Krookodile. Cresselia also faces stiff competition from the tier's many Psychic-types, namely Slowbro and Jirachi, as a Calm Mind wall and utility Pokemon, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball has lower Base Power than Ice Beam or Moonblast but can be used to nail opposing Psychic-types, most notably Jirachi, while being solid neutral coverage overall. Thunderbolt is another coverage option, and it can nail bulky Water-types such as Empoleon. However, both coverage options leave Cresselia vulnerable to Dark-types. On the Calm Mind set, Stored Power can be used over Psyshock due to its higher potential power with enough boosts. Colbur Berry can be used as a one-time shield against Bisharp's Sucker Punch or Knock Off from the likes of Krookodile, letting Cresselia either nail them with a boosted Moonblast or use Lunar Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: Cresselia's passivity makes it vulnerable to being afflicted with Taunt by the likes of Cyclizar and Krookodile as well as Encore by Maushold or Jirachi. Calm Mind sets are also vulnerable to being given a Choice item by Trick users like Gardevoir or Gengar</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Basculegion-F, Gengar, and Mimikyu can take most of Cresselia's attacks before retaliating with a Ghost-type move. However, all three hate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Defensive Dark-types, such as Umbreon and Wo-Chien, can comfortably take even Moonblast from Cresselia before whittling it down with Toxic and Leech Seed, respectively. Krookodile and Crawdaunt also threaten it offensively; however, neither like switching in to a potential Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: As Cresselia lacks coverage against Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Bisharp, these Pokemon can wall Cresselia handily. On top of that, the former two can easily whittle it down, while the latter threatens it with Throat Chop. However, all three must be careful not to get crippled by Trick. Jirachi can also handle Cresselia easily thanks to its defensive typing and access to a variety of disruption methods, namely Body Slam paralysis and its own Trick, though it must be wary of being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lunar Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lunar Dance lets Cresselia bring back weakened teammates like Rhyperior and Galarian Zapdos from the brink, letting them continue to break walls and, in the latter's case, sweep teams. Ice Beam targets Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gligar, while Moonblast can dent Dark-types, like Crawdaunt and Krookodile, that attempt to switch in well as Fighting-types like Mienshao. Both options target Dragon-types that may try to take advantage of Cresselia like Cyclizar and Flygon. Trick should only be used alongside a Choice Scarf, as it can then allow Cresselia to cripple Pokemon that wall it, such as Registeel, as well as sweepers that try to set up on it, like Bisharp. Thunder Wave lets Cresselia act as speed control for its team, crippling fast threats like Galarian Zapdos and Barraskewda; it can also be used against Pokemon that Cresselia has given a Choice Scarf via Trick so that it can cripple them further and prevent them from reaping the benefits of the item. Moonlight acts as semi-reliable recovery, and it should always be used over Trick if Rocky Helmet is being held. However, it can be used on Trick sets over Thunder Wave. In addition to Choice Scarf being able to cripple setup sweepers and fellow walls, it lets Cresselia act as emergency speed control and reliably use Lunar Dance against even strong wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Basculegion-F. Rocky Helmet can be used instead to punish physical attackers like Maushold as well as a weak U-Turn from the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Talonflame. Additionally, Rocky Helmet can let Cresselia move some Speed EVs into its Defense, letting it take on physical attackers like Terrakion better. Tera Fairy grants Cresselia a resistance to Dark-type attacks and removes many of its weaknesses, letting it check the likes of Crawdaunt, Krookodile, and Golurk. Additionally, it also grants a power boost to Moonblast, guaranteeing a 2HKO on the aforementioned Krookodile.</p> <p>Cresselia makes its home on bulky offense and balance structures that appreciate its ability to cripple a variety of Pokemon and revitalize an important teammate with Lunar Dance. Wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos and Basculegion-F benefit greatly from Cresselia's ability to bring them back from low health with Lunar Dance, giving them another chance to punch holes through teams. Slower attackers, like Bisharp and Mamoswine, appreciate Cresselia being able to heal them with Lunar Dance as well as crippling faster threats and physical walls with Thunder Wave and Trick, respectively. In return, they are able to dispatch Ghost- and Steel-types, respectively, with their STAB attacks. Fighting-types, such as Chesnaught and Galarian Zapdos, can deal with the Dark-types that threaten Cresselia, most notably Krookodile; in exchange, they appreciate Cresselia's ability to check opposing Galarian Zapdos as well as the speed control provided by its Thunder Wave. Cyclizar makes for a great partner with Cresselia, as it's able to check Ghost-types like Basculegion-F while keeping Stealth Rock off the field. In turn, Cyclizar appreciates Cresselia's ability to check opposing Dragon-types such as Noivern as well as cripple defensive Steel-types like Empoleon with Trick. On the defensive side, Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Umbreon can safely switch into Dark-type attacks while appreciating Cresselia's ability to cripple setup sweepers that could otherwise exploit them.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thanks to Cresselia's excellent bulk and access to recovery in Moonlight, it makes for a potent late-game Calm Mind sweeper that can be difficult for many teams to break through. Psyshock gives Cresselia the ability to beat opposing Calm Mind users like Slowbro and Suicune even after they've accumulated several boosts. Moonblast targets the Dark-types that attempt to switch in on Cresselia, such as Krookodile, as well as Dragon-types like Noivern. Leftovers helps keep Cresselia healthy during a sweep, making it less reliant on Moonlight for recovery, so that it can make progress quicker. This is especially important against bulkier teams that use Hippowdon, as Moonlight's recovery is reduced in sand. Covert Cloak protects Cresselia from Slowbro and Suicune's Scald as well as flinches and paralysis from Jirachi's Iron Head and Body Slam, respectively. Covert Cloak also blocks Psychic Noise's heal-blocking effect, letting Cresselia recover even against foes like Reuniclus and Slowbro. 136 Speed EVs are used to allow Cresselia to outspeed Bisharp and Modest Volcanion with the remaining EVs going into Defense so that Cresselia may check physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos and Entei. Tera Poison removes Cresselia's weaknesses; maintains its Fighting resist, letting it check Galarian Zapdos more easily; and grants it an immunity to Toxic from users like Umbreon and Quagsire, letting it completely wall them. While Tera Electric has less resistances than Tera Poison, it lets Cresselia have zero weaknesses thanks to Levitate; it also makes Cresselia immune to paralysis and gives it a resistance to Flying-type attacks from the likes of Galarian Zapdos.</p> <p>Cresselia offers bulky offense and balanced teams a durable wincon. Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion are able to switch into Dark-type attacks and put pressure on Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and Bisharp, while Cresselia is able to handle opposing Psychic-types that give them trouble, like Slowbro and Reuniclus. Magnezone makes for a great partner thanks to its ability to handle Jirachi and Empoleon, two of Cresselia's best checks, as well as providing a slow Volt Switch to bring Cresselia in safely. In return, Cresselia provides a Ground immunity with Levitate and can handle the likes of Raikou for it. Other pivots that can pressure Jirachi, like Basculegion-F and Talonflame, also work well with Cresselia. Assault Vest Cyclizar is an annoyance for Cresselia, as it can take a boosted Moonblast before phazing it with Dragon Tail. Therefore, physical revenge killers like Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile make for great teammates, especially since they can also revenge kill problematic Pokemon like Gengar. Assault Vest Cyclizar and Umbreon make for good defensive pairings with Cresselia, as they appreciate its ability to handle problematic Pokemon such as Mienshao and Mamoswine; in return, they check the Ghost-types that give it a headache, such as Gengar and Basculegion-F.</p>"

  "Lilligant-Hisui": {
    "overview": "<p>Hisuian Lilligant's exclusive access to Victory Dance and powerful abilities make it a niche option for offensive teams. Victory Dance bolsters its solid Attack and Speed stats while also giving it some resilience against physical attacks, particularly priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt and Barraskewda as well as Sucker Punch from Bisharp. Both of its abilities aid in Hisuian Lilligant's ability to sweep depending on what type of team it is on; Hustle gives it extra attacking power in exchange for less reliability, while Chlorophyll makes it nigh-impossible to outspeed under sun, especially after a boost from Victory Dance. However, Hisuian Lilligant's typing is a double-edged sword; despite offering useful resistances, it struggles with several common weaknesses, including a nasty 4x weakness to Flying-type moves. Additionally, its STAB moves are resisted by a whopping three types, forcing it to rely on Ice Spinner or Triple Axel for coverage; the former has mediocre power without Tera Ice, while the latter has unreliable accuracy. Hisuian Lilligant is also rather fragile and is prone to being picked off by faster boosted threats like Choice Scarf Gengar and Galarian Zapdos or forms of priority that it does not resist, such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard. The latter issue becomes especially pressing if it's forced to Terastallize, making it vulnerable to priority users it otherwise checks like Crawdaunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tera Blast in conjunction with Tera Psychic or Ghost can be used to muscle through Pokemon that otherwise check Hisuian Lilligant, like Amoonguss or Reuniclus, respectively. However, it becomes heavily reliant on Terastallization to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, and it becomes more vulnerable to priority, particularly Sucker Punch. Petal Blizzard is an option on Hustle sets in order to avoid contact-based effects such as Rocky Helmet and Talonflame's Flame Body, though Leaf Blade's critical hit chance makes it the overall stronger option. On Chlorophyll variants, Swords Dance provides more immediate breaking power over Victory Dance; however, it leaves Hisuian Lilligant more vulnerable to physical priority moves like Extreme Speed from Entei and prevents it from outspeeding key threats outside of sun such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Physically bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Armarouge can take at least one boosted attack from Hisuian Lilligant before retaliating with a super effective move. Armarouge in particular can take a hit from it and double its Speed with Weak Armor, letting it move first for a revenge kill and reverse sweep.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mimikyu can take a hit from Hisuian Lilligant thanks to Disguise, hit it with a super effective Play Rough, and pick it off with Shadow Sneak. Entei can reliably revenge kill Hiusian Lilligant with Extreme Speed, but does not appreciate taking Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Gengar, Azelf, and Infernape, can outspeed Hisuian Lilligant outside of sun even after a Victory Dance before OHKOing it with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Hisuian Lilligant has not Terastallized into the Fire-type, getting burned can stop it from sweeping. Talonflame can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, with Talonflame also being able to punish it with Flame Body. Additionally, paralysis from the likes of Jirachi and Cresselia can heavily cripple it, especially if it is using Hustle.</p>",

      "Victory Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>After one use of Victory Dance, Hisuian Lilligant gains the ability to outrun offensive threats like non-Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion outside of sun while breaking through physically bulky Pokemon like Volcanion and Registeel. If Hustle and Wide Lens are used, then Leaf Blade is the preferred Grass-type STAB move of choice due to its reliable power and high critical hit ratio. On Chlorophyll and Loaded Dice variants, Bullet Seed is the preferred choice due to its higher power, ability to break through lead Terrakion's Focus Sash, and the fact that it does not make contact. Ice Spinner is Hisuian Lilligant's most reliable coverage move, hitting Pokemon that resist Hisuian Lilligant's STAB moves, such as Noivern and Amoonguss, for solid damage. Triple Axel has more damage potential, notably OHKOing Amoonguss at +1; however, it's less reliable due to Hustle cutting into its already-imperfect accuracy, and it can cause Hisuian Lilligant to be burned by Talonflame's Flame Body or heavily chipped by Rocky Helmet from the likes of Chesnaught. If using Loaded Dice, however, Triple Axel is preferred. On non sun teams, Hisuian Lilligant appreciates the power boost Hustle provides; however, it will have to use Wide Lens to partially offset the ability's accuracy penalty. If used on a sun team, Hisuian Lilligant should run Chlorophyll in order to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under sun. Tera Fire is typically preferred because it prevents Hisuian Lilligant from being burned, letting it set up on the likes of Talonflame. Tera Ice boosts the power of Hisuian Lilligant's Ice-type coverage moves, letting it OHKO Amoonguss with Ice Spinner and pick off weakened Chesnaught. Hisuian Lilligant should only be Terastallized if priority users like Crawdaunt and Lycanroc-D are taken care of, as it will become more vulnerable to being picked off. It is worth noting that both options let it take Ice Shard from Mamoswine, preventing it from revenge killing Hisuian Lilligant.</p> <p>Hisuian Lilligant best fits on offensive structures, including bulky and hyper offense. On bulky offense, it appreciates specially offensive pivots such as Magnezone and Raikou that can bring it in safely against Pokemon like Jirachi. The former is able to check Poison- and Flying-types like Amoonguss and Noivern, while the latter can bait in bulky Steel-types like Registeel, letting Hisuian Lilligant use them as setup bait. Physical wallbreakers like Crawdaunt and Krookodile can put pressure on physical walls like Cresselia to give it an easier time sweeping. Entry hazard support from the likes of Jirachi and Klefki further wear down Pokemon that would otherwise check Hisuian Lilligant like Chesnaught; after one layer of Spikes, Chesnaught is OHKOed by a Triple Axel boosted by Hustle or Tera Ice. Additionally, Hisuian Lilligant appreciates hazard control from Pokemon like Cyclizar and Maushold, helping to prevent it from being picked off by Entei's Tera Normal Extreme Speed. The former is able to remove Rocky Helmet from defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss with Knock Off, while the latter puts additional pressure on physical walls and can cripple them with Encore. Maushold also appreciates Hisuian Lilligant wearing down its shared checks, such as Rocky Helmet Amoonguss, on hyper offense teams. Torkoal is another excellent hazard-controlling teammate due to its ability to set sun as well as Stealth Rock. On sun teams, Volcanion makes for an excellent teammate due to its ability to check opposing Fire-types like Armarouge and absorb Scald from the likes of Slowbro and Suicune. In exchange, Hisuian Lilligant can smash through the likes of Hisuian Goodra for it and can take Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Hippowdon and Krookodile.</p>"

  "Krookodile": {
    "overview": "<p>Krookodile is a fantastic progress maker in RU due to having access to Knock Off and important utility moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt while being incredibly threatening offensively thanks to its high Attack and the perfect coverage provided by its STAB moves and Gunk Shot. Although Krookodile is most often seen taking advantage of Intimidate and its decent defensive typing to act as an entry hazard setter and physical sponge, its Choice item sets can easily run away with games if not handled carefully thanks to its spammable STAB attacks, especially when assisted by Moxie. However, Krookodile suffers from a lack of recovery options, which hinders its longevity and ability to keep hazards up throughout the game. Its overreliance on immunities and resistances to switch in on wallbreakers like Magnezone and Mimikyu further holds it back defensively. Lastly, Krookodile's mediocre Speed tier renders it vulnerable to faster threats such as Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos, which is intensified by its weakness to U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scale Shot + Bulk Up or Moxie can be used alongside Loaded Dice to transform Krookodile into a deceptively strong setup sweeper, but it is often difficult to pull off due to it being very situational. Roar and Dragon Tail are decent options for phazing out setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Flygon that could otherwise take advantage of Krookodile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Tanks</strong>: The common physically defensive Pokemon in RU, particularly Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Chesnaught, can often wall Krookodile and keep it from making progress. While Krookodile can hit the last two with Knock Off and Gunk Shot, it is still fearful of their retaliation through Scald and Body Press, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Terrakion, Mienshao, and Galarian Zapdos either take little damage from or outspeed Krookodile, which allows them to blow holes through Krookodile's team or safely use U-turn into another Pokemon after forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite Intimidate, Krookodile's subpar bulk often prevents it from switching into strong physical attacks such as Maushold's Population Bomb and Entei's Sacred Fire. It is also quite vulnerable to coverage from special wallbreakers such as Moonblast Gardevoir, Energy Ball Armarouge, and Focus Blast Gengar, which serve as deterrent for its entry; otherwise, Krookodile would want to switch in on one or both of their STAB moves because of its immunity or resistance to them. Therefore, Krookodile's defensive utility is often heavily prediction-reliant and can be exploited by offensive structures.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Krookodile is a ferocious wallbreaker with its nearly unresisted STAB combination of Earthquake and Knock Off. It is difficult to consistently weather Krookodile's attacks due to its resistance to Stealth Rock and serviceable natural bulk combined with Intimidate giving it many opportunities to hit the field against Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Necrozma, and Reuniclus. Gunk Shot gives Krookodile great coverage, hitting common checks to it like Chesnaught for decent damage, while also having the ability to spread poison. Close Combat gives Krookodile the ability to annihilate Dark-types like Umbreon and opposing Krookodile. Crunch can be used to consistently hit Pokemon such as Slowbro and Noivern once their item has been removed. Tera Dark allows for freakishly powerful Dark-type STAB moves, allowing it to OHKO Slowbro with a boosted Knock Off or Crunch after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Amoonguss with Knock Off. It also gives Krookodile the ability to shed its Ground typing, removing its Water- and Grass-type weaknesses and improving matchups into Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Choice Scarf Basculegion-F. Alternatively, Tera Poison can be used to flip its Bug- and Fighting-type weaknesses, giving it better matchups into Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion. It also strengthens Gunk Shot, allowing Krookodile to completely crush its common checks like Chesnaught.</p> <p>Krookodile thrives on bulky offense and balance teams where it acts as a wallbreaker that provides defensive utility due to its Electric and Psychic immunities. Krookodile fits well with pivots that allow it to freely switch in without taking any sort of damage such as Magnezone, Noivern, and Jirachi, since it lacks recovery. Slowbro pairs well with Krookodile, as it resists the Fighting- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Mienshao and Barraskewda aimed at Krookodile, while Krookodile resists the Electric- and Ghost-type attacks from Magnezone and Gengar aimed at Slowbro. Slowbro also spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave, which Krookodile greatly appreciates, as it is slower that some potent offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Gengar. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Reuniclus can threaten the Poison- and Fighting-types such as Galarian Zapdos, Amoonguss, and Chesnaught that switch into Krookodile. Krookodile enjoys entry hazard control from the likes of Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame due to its vulnerability to Spikes. The former two are also pivots that invite in Steel-types for Krookodile, while Talonflame is a great defensive presence capable of switching into a plethora of strong attackers such as Mamoswine, opposing Krookodile, and Mienshao. Balance teams that slowly whittle down the opposition, especially with Spikes support from the likes of Chesnaught and Quagsire, enjoy Krookodile's unique defensive profile as well as strong STAB Knock Off to remove the ever-present Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Bulky offense teams with multiple switch moves like U-turn from Pokemon like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Jirachi provide Krookodile with many entry points, capitalizing on its offensive and defensive utility to maintain hazards and wear down teams.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Krookodile solidifies its place in the metagame as the premier offensive Ground-type, with access to Stealth Rock and Intimidate giving it great utility for an offensive Pokemon. Krookodile has advantages over other Ground-type entry hazard setters like Flygon and Hippowdon because of its combination of good Speed and access to Knock Off, which helps accumulate hazard chip by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as  and Slowbro. Taunt helps Krookodile disrupt slower Pokemon trying to setup on it like Cresselia and Gyarados while also being used to prevent other Pokemon like Hippowdon and Umbreon from setting up hazards and using status moves. Gunk Shot helps against switch-ins that would otherwise resist its STAB moves, hitting Chesnaught for super effective damage. Leftovers is preferred on Krookodile to passively recover on Pokemon it forces out, giving it more longevity and offsetting Stealth Rock damage. Tera Poison flips the weaknesses to Bug, Fairy, and Fighting into valuable resistances while giving Gunk Shot a STAB boost. Resisting Bug- and Fighting-type attacks is great for Krookodile, allowing it to resist U-turn from Cyclizar and take on Fighting-type Pokemon faster than it such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao. Tera Ghost similarly flips the weaknesses to Bug and Fighting, and allows Krookodile to block Rapid Spin from the tier’s most common hazard removal, Cyclizar.</p> <p>Stealth Rock Krookodile fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate having a more offensive entry hazard setter that is able to force progress with Knock Off, stack hazard chip damage on Heavy-Duty Boots users, and threaten common hazard removal options like Cyclizar, Talonflame, and Noivern. Krookodile appreciates teammates that can switch into super effective attacks from Pokemon trying to revenge kill it like Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao, and defensive switch-ins that threaten it like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Gastrodon. Steel-types  such as Empoleon and Jirachi make for good teammates, resisting Fairy-type attacks from Gardevoir that would otherwise threaten Krookodile. Empoleon also covers its Water-type weakness, and Jirachi appreciates having a teammate that can take Dark-type moves for it. Jirachi relies on Covert Cloak users like Slowbro and Gyarados getting their item removed to capitalize on its paralysis and flinch chances with Body Slam and Iron Head, respectively. Offensive teammates such as Volcanion and Armarouge benefit from Krookodile removing Assault Vest from their most common switch-in, Cyclizar, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Noivern.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Krookodile can fill many roles in a match; it can revenge kill weakened foes, force progress against bulky teams with Knock Off, switch into attacks that it resists to threaten slower foes with a KO, and clean up teams weakened by its teammates. Gunk Shot threatens Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Chesnaught and can poison Slowbro, which is otherwise able to check Krookodile once its item is removed. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Noivern and Talonflame hard. Close Combat can OHKO Cyclizar and provides strong coverage for opposing Krookodile, Wo-Chien, and Crawdaunt. Stealth Rock allows Krookodile to be an entry hazard setter, letting more offensive teams forgo a more defensive hazard setter like Hippowdon or Empoleon. Choice Scarf makes Krookodile outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and other common Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F and Gardevoir. Intimidate lets Krookodile take hits from physical attackers like Jirachi to force them out or revenge kill them. Moxie lets Krookodile be a late-game cleaner and sweeper that makes sacrificing Pokemon to bring others in much riskier for the opponent. Tera Poison lets Krookodile resist normally super effective attacks such as Moonblast from Gardevoir, Close Combat from Mienshao, and Giga Drain from Amoonguss allowing it to score KOs it may otherwise not have and begin its sweep with Moxie boosts. Tera Poison also empowers Gunk Shot, turning it into Krookodile's strongest STAB attack. Tera Dark is an alternative that boosts Knock Off, letting it OHKO Jirachi and Reuniclus after a bit of chip damage. It also removes Krookodile's weakness to Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt and Feraligatr.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Krookodile fits on more offensive teams that are looking for a sweeper that doesn't need to take time to set up or a revenge killer that can safely switch into or force out physical wallbreakers. Krookodile can switch into predicted Electric- and Psychic-type attacks from Magnezone, Armarouge and Reuniclus and force them out, but it needs to be careful when doing so, as these Pokemon usually carry coverage moves that threaten Krookodile. Spikes stacking teams can benefit immensely from Krookodile due to its ability to get rid of Heavy-Duty Boots with STAB Knock Off and sweep a weakened opposing team with Moxie boosts. Chesnaught can take the Grass- and Water-type attacks that threaten Krookodile while also taking Knock Off handily and setting Spikes. Poison-types like Gengar and Amoonguss can swap into the Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type attacks that Krookodile would rather avoid while also baiting out Psychic-type attacks for Krookodile to freely switch into. Steel-types additionally can easily take the Grass- and Fairy-type attacks that threaten Krookodile, making Jirachi and Magnezone excellent partners. Krookodile is a great partner for Cyclizar, as it is able to threaten Ghost-types that come in and spinblock Cyclizar. It also synergizes with other entry hazard removers like Talonflame, which has an immunity to Ground and a 4x resistance Bug-type attacks and 2x resistance to Fighting-type attacks that threaten Krookodile, and Noivern, which can take Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Krookodile while also removing hazards for it. Strong wallbreakers like Volcanion can threaten defensive checks to Krookodile like Slowbro and Chesnaught, making progress against Pokemon that it struggles with. Defensive checks to Krookodile like Hippowdon and Gastrodon can also be threatened by strong special attackers like Armarouge and Hisuian Goodra.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is a versatile Pokemon that can either serve as a potentially devastating late-game wincon with its offensive sets or as a defensive tank that can utilize its naturally good bulk and a multitude of utility options to support its teammates. Both of its abilities are fantastic; Magic Guard's immunity to passive damage is incredibly valuable for making Reuniclus very hard to take down as a setup sweeper, which makes it match up amazingly well against bulkier structures and Pokemon that struggle to deal large amounts of damage, while Regenerator allows it to enter the field and take hits for its teammates more often, helping Reuniclus fill more of a support role. Reuniclus's good natural bulk and access to Recover further solidify its longevity to impressive levels. However, Reuniclus's very low Speed stat makes it unable to outspeed anything relevant, including other base 30 Speed Pokemon, without resorting to Speed creep. This forces Reuniclus to tank hits very frequently, which hinders its longevity. Reuniclus's mono-Psychic typing further renders it weak to two of the most common attacks in the game in Knock Off and U-turn as well as Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from wallbreakers like Bisharp and Basculegion-F. Lastly, Reuniclus competes with other common defensive Pokemon, in particular Slowbro, Mew, and Jirachi, as they are all able to perform similar and potentially better roles as both Calm Mind sweepers and defensive sponges, which means that Reuniclus may not always be the best fit for a particular role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball can be used as coverage that allows Reuniclus to threaten Water-types like Slowbro and Suicune more effectively. Future Sight can be used to discourage defensive Poison-type Pokemon such as Amoonguss from switching in, which can serve as great support for Fighting-type wallbreakers like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos. Encore can be used on support sets to punish setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Flygon that could otherwise exploit defensive Reuniclus's passivity to set up safely. Life Orb is a powerful offensive item that improves Reuniclus's ability to break through special walls and sweep, especially since its recoil damage can be ignored with Magic Guard. Regenerator Reuniclus sets lacking Calm Mind can opt for Assault Vest to boost their ability to tank special attacks from threats such as Armarouge, although it has the significant drawback of preventing it from using Recover. Colbur Berry provides Reuniclus with valuable insurance against Knock Off. Covert Cloak improves Reuniclus's matchup against common Pokemon like Psychic Noise Slowbro and Iron Head Jirachi.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Offensive Dark-type Pokemon like Crawdaunt, Krookodile, and Bisharp can easily overwhelm Reuniclus with powerful super effective attacks. Although Reuniclus may be able to threaten the latter two back with Focus Blast by surviving a hit, it is highly risky due to its low accuracy. Umbreon can also serve as a perfect defensive counter to non-Focus Blast Reuniclus.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type wallbreakers such as Gengar, Basculegion-F, and Mimikyu are able to significantly threaten Reuniclus without putting themselves in too much risk due to its weak attacks.</p> <p><strong>Disruption</strong>: Common anti-setup and anti-stall tactics such as Encore, Taunt, and Trick from threats such as Jirachi, Noivern, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, respectively, can cripple Reuniclus by preventing it from setting up and using Recover.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Reuniclus is a potent late-game cleaner that is difficult to break past for weakened teams. Reuniclus is unable to be dealt with through forms of passive damage such as Spikes, Toxic, and Leech Seed, which many defensive teams rely on to wear down opposing threats. While slow, Reuniclus sports good bulk when invested, allowing it to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, and Slowbro that can't damage it for more than around half of its HP, as it will simply recover off the damage over time and KO them with a boosted STAB move or coverage. Tera complicates this further, as Reuniclus can flip its bad type matchups and set up on Pokemon like Krookodile and Barraskewda that are typically able to threaten it with significant damage. Powerful Pokemon holding boosting items such as Life Orb Mimikyu and Choice Specs Basculegion-F can threaten Reuniclus with strong super effective STAB moves while not being immediately KOed by Reuniclus's own relatively weak attacks before boosting. Reuniclus must also be wary of Encore and Roar from Pokemon such as Jirachi and Empoleon that can switch in and disrupt its boosting before it's strong enough to break the opposing team. Jirachi in particular can flinch Reuniclus down with Iron Head before it has a chance to use Recover. Psychic Noise is chosen as the primary STAB move to thwart both Slowbro and opposing Reuniclus's attempts to heal. It also stops faster defensive walls like Gastrodon and Empoleon from healing for a turn, either letting Reuniclus finish them off or switching to a teammate that forces them out. This keeps special walls from recovering back to full HP, letting Reuniclus outlast them and sweep. Focus Blast hits Dark-types immune to Psychic Noise like Krookodile and Bisharp while slamming Steel-types like Magnezone and Hisuian Goodra. Shadow Ball helps Reuniclus beat variations of Calm Mind Slowbro with Covert Cloak that block Psychic Noise and hits other Psychic-types like Jirachi and opposing Reuniclus. Leftovers helps reduce Reuniclus's reliance on Recover, allowing it to boost more often with Calm Mind or attack once already boosted. Rocky Helmet punishes Jirachi trying to flinch Reuniclus with Iron Head or paralyze it with Body Slam while also wearing down Pokemon with U-turn and Knock Off like Galarian Zapdos and Cyclizar that want to pivot to another teammate or remove Reuniclus's item. Due to Reuniclus having an effective immunity to status like poison, it does not need to use Tera Poison to beat Umbreon and Bellibolt and instead can opt for Tera Water or Fairy for their defensive value. Tera Water allows Reuniclus to resist Iron Head from Steel-type checks like Jirachi and Bisharp and rain-boosted Water-type attacks from Barraskewda and Kingdra. Tera Fairy flips Reuniclus's Dark weakness into a resistance, which is helpful for resisting strong Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Bisharp and Krookodile. Bug-types like Ribombee and Kleavor can be set up on once Reuniclus resists their most powerful STAB moves as well. Tera Fairy also has the additional benefit of an immunity to Dragon Tail users such as Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra looking to phaze it out.</p> <p>Calm Mind Reuniclus offers bulky offense and balanced teams good counterplay to the residual damage of entry hazards as well as an absorber of burn and Toxic poison. For example, Reuniclus can help relieve pressure on Cyclizar to spin away entry hazards because Reuniclus itself does not care about their residual damage. This allows Cyclizar to more freely use Knock Off to remove opposing items and use U-turn to pivot out of switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra looking to take advantage of Rapid Spin. Reuniclus is a great switch-in to status spreaders like Slowbro and Talonflame, and as such partners that bait in these Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Barraskewda that can use pivoting moves make good partners, allowing Reuniclus to enter the field and set up. Switching in on status moves like Scald is often advantageous for Reuniclus, as burn or Toxic poison prevents Reuniclus from being paralyzed by its most common check, Jirachi. Reuniclus does not appreciate losing its Leftovers to Cyclizar's Knock Off, so teammates like Amoonguss and Terrakion that can switch in on Knock Off and threaten damage on the opponent are good options. Rocky Helmet Chesnaught is another way to punish Knock Off that can set Spikes to chip down Reuniclus's checks while acting as a good check to strong physical attacking Dark-types like Crawdaunt and Bisharp that threaten Reuniclus. Specially defensive Jirachi is a thorn in Reuniclus's side regardless of its coverage option, as it can be flinched down with Iron Head and paralyzed. Basculegion-F and Magnezone are strong special breakers that don't fear Body Slam paralysis or Iron Head from defensive Jirachi and thus force out the opponent's Jirachi into a teammate that must now absorb a hit from some of the most threatening special attackers in the tier. These three teammates also have pivoting moves in Flip Turn and Volt Switch, letting them choose a teammate to bring in on a predicted Jirachi switch while chipping down the opponent's switch-in in the process.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Reuniclus finds a place in a metagame lacking phenomenal Dark-types outside of Krookodile and Bisharp and with a myriad of Fighting- and Psychic- types such as Terrakion, Mienshao, Slowbro and Jirachi. Its bulk and typing allow it to continuously switch into the aforementioned Fighting- and Psychic-types' moves and weaken the opposition while staying healthy with a combination of Recover and Regenerator. It can also act as a crucial member of teams relying on paralysis that enjoy its resistance to Fighting as well as its ability to invite in the likes of Bisharp and Jirachi and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Despite being in competition with Slowbro, Reuniclus's Electric neutrality as well as higher special bulk make it sometimes worth using over Slowbro. Thunder Wave makes it easier for wallbreakers like Volcanion, Golurk, and Crawdaunt to shine. Psychic Noise is used over the stronger Psychic and Psyshock due to the recovery blocking effect. Knock Off is another excellent support move that forces progress by removing the bevy of Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Focus Blast can be used over Knock Off to deal with Krookodile and Bisharp as well as smacking Empoleon. Tera Water gives Reuniclus an excellent defensive matchup against rain teams and strong Water-type attacks from offensive threats such as Barraskewda, Suicune, and Volcanion while also removing the weakness to Bug- and Dark-type attacks like U-turn and Knock Off. Tera Fairy turns the aforementioned weaknesses into resistances and is generally a good defensive Tera type for a bulkier Pokemon like Reuniclus, helping out against common Pokemon like Cyclizar and Krookodile.</p> <p>Reuniclus fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that enjoy its ability to switch into the myriad of Fighting-type moves in the tier and slow down and soften the opposition with Thunder Wave and Knock Off, respectively. Volcanion and Crawdaunt are great offensive partners for Reuniclus, as they enjoy Reuniclus's ability to slow down the opposition. Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos make great offensive and defensive partners for Reuniclus. On the offensive side, they enjoy Reuniclus's Thunder Wave support and its Psychic resistance, while on the defensive side they resist the omnipresent Knock Off and U-turn. Reuniclus also enjoy Palossand, Amoonguss, Chesnaught and other Fighting-type checks due to its crippling weakness to Knock Off and U-turn. Palossand and Chesnaught are also excellent entry hazard setters and enjoy Reuniclus's Knock Off support. However, since this Reuniclus set doesn't use Magic Guard, it enjoys hazard-removing partners like Cyclizar.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a decent wall in the tier with a solid defensive typing that allows it to check Pokemon such as Barraskewda, Mimikyu, and Rhyperior. Amoonguss is more flexible and less prone to being passive than similar walls such as Chesnaught due to its access to Regenerator. With a myriad of support moves such as Stun Spore and Toxic, Amoonguss can make progress against the opposing team by crippling them with status conditions, as well as being a good pivot to threats. However, Amoonguss matches up poorly against common threats in the tier such as Armarouge, Galarian Zapdos, and Mamoswine. It is also prone to being setup fodder against threats it's normally supposed to check, such as Taunt Gyarados and Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune. Finally, due to having poor offensive prowess, Amoonguss can easily be overwhelmed by VoltTurn cores despite having Regenerator.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Amoonguss can run Eject Button to act as a pivot, which is suitable on offensive teams because it allows Amoonguss to act as a blanket check to threats and give a safe switch in to a teammate. Alternatively, Amoonguss can also run Eject Pack + Leaf Storm to act as a pivot while dealing decent damage. Clear Smog can be used to stop setup sweepers such as Gyarados and Mimikyu. Amoonguss can run Synthesis to have reliable recovery, but this restricts its utility, since it has to choose between removing Sludge Bomb, Toxic, or Foul Play.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Galarian Zapdos and Noivern can threaten to beat Amoonguss with Flying-type STAB moves. Noivern is especially dangerous due to it commonly running Taunt, which denies Amoonguss from crippling Noivern with status conditions.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Volcanion, Entei, and Armarouge can OHKO Amoonguss, while it cannot deal much damage in return. Volcanion in particular does not mind the paralysis, so it is particularly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Mamoswine, Armarouge, and Bisharp can break through Amoonguss's bulk with strong STAB moves, and they have an easy time setting up on it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Jirachi, Slowbro, and Reuniclus can deal great damage to Amoonguss with their Psychic-type STAB moves, and Amoonguss cannot do much damage in return. Jirachi and Slowbro get crippled significantly by Stun Spore and Toxic, respectively, but Reuniclus shrugs off the status conditions, making it particularly threatening.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to hit Water-types such as Slowbro, Politoed, and Barraskewda while allowing it to recover its HP, which is especially useful, since it otherwise can only heal with Regenerator. Stun Spore is a great support move that allows Amoonguss to paralyze foes such as Gengar, Jirachi, and Krookodile, providing good utility for the team and punishing aggressive players by paralyzing Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Noivern. Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Flying-types such as Noivern and Talonflame on the switch in, potentially crippling them with poison. Sludge Bomb deals decent damage to Cyclizar and is decent against Umbreon, as they both do not want to get poisoned. Toxic is a great support move that can be used over Sludge Bomb to punish switches that would otherwise match up well against Amoonguss, such as Volcanion and Noivern, and it also cripples Chesnaught, which otherwise can set up Spikes on Amoonguss. Foul Play lets Amoonguss punish offensive Pokemon trying to set up on it, such as Gyarados, Feraligatr, and Mimikyu. Foul Play also prevents Pokemon like Jirachi and Gengar from switching into Amoonguss. Stomping Tantrum can be an option to punish Pokemon that are usually counters to Amoonguss such as Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Magnezone, and it is great when paired up with Toxic due to having double power against the aforementioned Pokemon after Toxic fails. Rocky Helmet allows Amoonguss to punish U-turn users such as Noivern and Jirachi and threatens to KO Maushold. Heavy-Duty Boots is excellent on Amoonguss thanks to increasing its longevity. The EV spread ensures Amoonguss avoids being 2HKOed by Draco Meteor from non-Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra and Sludge Wave from unboosted Gengar. The rest of the EVs maximize Amoonguss's physical bulk to ensure it can tank common attacks such as Knock Off from Krookodile and Shadow Claw from Mimikyu better. Tera Steel is a solid defensive typing that allows Amoonguss to flip its Psychic weakness, allowing it to check Gardevoir and Jirachi while retaining its Toxic immunity. Tera Water allows Amoonguss to not get flinched down by Iron Head Jirachi and match up better against Volcanion and Mamoswine, which are common threats to Amoonguss, as well as allowing Amoonguss to retain the Water resistance. Tera Ghost allows Amoonguss to act as a spinblocker against Cyclizar and match up well versus Fighting-types.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a good teammate in bulky offense and balance teams, especially teams based on spreading paralysis. It enjoys teammates like Slowbro that can deal with its threats such as Armarouge, Galarian Zapdos, and Mamoswine. Slowbro and Amoonguss make up a Regenerator core that can pivot into threats accordingly, and their types synergize well, since Amoonguss can deal with Pokemon that threaten Slowbro such as Hisuian Lilligant, Mimikyu, and Golurk. Pokemon that appreciate paralyzed foes are good teammates, such as Armarouge and Mamoswine, since they are strong but slower wallbreakers. Steel-types have an easier time dealing with Amoonguss, so Pokemon that can punish them are appreciated, such as Armarouge, Mamoswine, and Krookodile. Entry hazard removers like Noivern, Talonflame, and Cyclizar are useful, since Amoonguss is susceptible to being setup fodder for hazards. Offensive Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra, and Gengar enjoy Amoonguss's ability to blanket-check revenge killers like Basuclegion-F, Krookodile, and Mimikyu while still being able to keep the momentum thanks to Regenerator.</p>"

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienshao's access to Knock Off, U-turn, a great ability in Regenerator, and strong coverage solidifies its place as one of the tier's best offensive pivots. Knock Off and U-turn are a tried-and-true combo at making progress by allowing Mienshao to remove items and pivot out on potential switch-ins to keep up momentum. Mienshao's coverage options in Ice Spinner, Triple Axel, and Stone Edge complement its STAB Close Combat by allowing it to hit Noivern. Mienshao's top-tier ability in Regenerator allows it to shrug off many forms of chip damage like entry hazards, Life Orb, and Rocky Helmet, and it can power through weaker attacks from Pokemon like Cyclizar and Jirachi and threaten them with a strong attack at a low cost to itself. Despite all of that, Mienshao's frailty means that even physical walls with no Attack investment like Hippowdon and Amoonguss can threaten with significant damage, and running Life Orb makes Mienshao easier to revenge kill by faster Pokemon like Cyclizar due to the recoil damage. This makes pivot support from Pokemon like Talonflame and Magnezone very valuable to allow Mienshao to safely enter the field. Furthermore, defensive Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Talonflame and Slowbro can switch into Mienshao, punish it with Flame Body and Rocky Helmet, respectively, and threaten super effective attacks to knock it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double-Edge can be slotted for coverage as means to hit Slowbro and Gastrodon for good neutral damage, while Regenerator heals off any recoil taken, but it misses out on coverage to deal with either Grass-types like Chesnaught and Amoonguss or Pokemon like Talonflame. This can be combined with Tera Normal to achieve a 2HKO on Gastrdon with Life Orb. Triple Axel can be used on Choice Scarf sets, trading accuracy for power and hitting certain foes like Chesnaught and Amoonguss for more damage. Choice Band allows Mienshao to 2HKO Chesnaught and Hippowdon with entry hazard support, but the downside of being Choice-locked might not be worth the small boost over Life Orb, and it still leaves Mienshao vulnerable to faster revenge killers. Swords Dance can strengthen Mienshao's role as a wallbreaker by allowing it to get past annoying switch-ins such as Hippowdon and Slowbro when combined with Life Orb, but it completely takes away Mienshao's role as a pivot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro resist most of Mienshao's moves and are bulky enough to freely switch into it, recovering any damage and threatening it back with super effective attacks or crippling status.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Slowbro and Gardevoir can switch into Mienshao's main STAB attack or take advantage of the move its locked into if it's holding a Choice item. Slowbro and Reuniclus are both tanky enough to survive any attack from Mienshao and threaten back with super effective damage, while Choice Scarf Gardevoir can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Mienshao, copy Regenerator with Trace, and threaten an OHKO on Mienshao.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Both Hippowdon and Chesnaught sport incredible physical bulk and are able to freely switch into Mienshao, recover any damage taken, and threaten back significant damage due to Mienshao's frail bulk. Hippowdon and Chesnaught being common Rocky Helmet users means Mienshao can get punished for using Triple Axel, and it fails to 2HKO them without any damage-boosting items.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Burns from Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp from Talonflame and Gengar can truly cripple Mienshao's damage output and make it way less threatening to most Pokemon.</p>",

Knock Off punishes Close Combat switch-ins like Slowbro and Basculegion-F. Ice Spinner hits Flying- and Grass-types like Galarian Zapdos, Noivern, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Stone Edge also hits Flying-types for super effective damage and guarantees an OHKO on Talonflame while not risking getting burnt by Flame Body. U-turn keeps up momentum by pivoting on predicted switches such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught. Regenerator helps increase Mienshao's longevity, letting it pivot around while healing off entry hazard damage and even switching in on weaker attacks. Tera Fighting allows Close Combat to 2HKO Jirachi, Noivern, and Quagsire. Tera Dark defensively helps Mienshao against Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Psychic Noise Jirachi and boosts Knock Off's damage to guarantee an OHKO on Armarouge and Basculegion-F.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Mienshao fits best on offensive teams, acting as a great form of speed control, a late-game cleaner, and a premier revenge killer by outspeeding other common Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Krookodile. Mienshao can find itself easily taken advantage of by Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types like Gengar, Armarouge, and Gardevoir due to it being Choice-locked, so defensive partners that can switch into attacks from the aforementioned Pokemon like Krookodile, Empoleon, and Jirachi are appreciated. They, as well as bulkier options like Hippowdon and Umbreon, can further support Mienshao by setting up entry hazards or spreading Toxic poison to soften up the opposing team and make it easier for Mienshao to clean up, while Mienshao's Knock Off can remove potential Heavy-Duty Boots to rack up residual damage with hazards set up by its aforementioned teammates. Mienshao can form strong offensive VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Barraskewda, Baculegion-F, and Magnezone, keeping up momentum and racking up damage on switch-ins like Slowbro, Noivern, and Cyclizar, while Pokemon like Noivern and Jirachi lure in Steel-types such as opposing Jirachi and Empoleon before pivoting in Mienshao to threaten them. Slow wallbreakers like Choice Specs Basculegion-F and Hisuian Goodra appreciate pivoting in safely with Mienshao's U-turn and can force out and wear down Pokemon that would otherwise check Mienshao like Slowbro and Talonflame; they can also soften the walls on the opposing team to make it easier for Mienshao to sweep. Mienshao is able to form sturdy Regenerator cores with other Pokemon like Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Cyclizar to help increase the longevity of the team. Slowbro and Reuniclus are especially appreciated, as they can provide Future Sight support to punish any Poison-types switching in on Mienshao's STAB attack like Amoonguss.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Life Orb Mienshao is a menacing threat in the metagame, capitalizing on Regenerator to mitigate the Life Orb recoil while hammering foes with hard-hitting attacks. Knock Off allows Mienshao to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types that attempt to switch in on Close Combat like Gengar, Armarouge, and Slowbro. U-turn helps it keep up momentum by pivoting on switch-ins like Chesnaught and Hippowdon while also hitting Psychic-types such as Slowbro for super effective damage. Triple Axel hits Flying- and Grass-types like Noivern, Galarian Zapdos, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Ice Spinner trades power for accuracy, making Mienshao more reliable in exchange for missing out on important 2HKOs on Chesnaught and Hippowdon. Regenerator is an exceptional ability that synergizes well with Life Orb, boosting Mienshao's damage while offsetting any recoil and entry hazard damage on the switch. Tera Steel flips Mienshao's weaknesses to Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks into resistances, giving it great defensive utility against Fairy- and Flying-types like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Steel also gives it a useful Dragon resistance that helps Mienshao against Noivern and Cyclizar. Tera Dark provides similar defensive utility, making Flying-type attacks neutral and providing a STAB boost to Knock Off to OHKO Armarouge and Jirachi.</p> <p>Mienshao is an excellent pivot that can double as a wallbreaker thanks to its damage output being boosted by Life Orb and can function on bulky offense and offense teams. Mienshao appreciates entry hazard support that can help it pick up KOs on Pokemon it otherwise would not be able to like Amoonguss, so entry hazard setters such as Empoleon, Chesnaught, and Jirachi make for great teammates. This synergy goes both ways, as Mienshao's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Slowbro and Amoongus to rack up residual damage with hazards. Empoleon and Jirachi are notable teammates for their ability to take on Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Gardevoir, and Slowbro. Slowbro and Reuniclus can provide Future Sight support that punishes Poison-types and physical walls attempting to wall Mienshao like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Hippowdon; in return, Mienshao threatens Dark- and Steel-types like Krookodile, Empoleon, and Jirachi that try to absorb Future Sight, all while forming strong Regenerator cores with Slowbro and Reuniclus. Mienshao can also form strong VoltTurn cores with a plethora of Pokemon such as Magnezone, Raikou, and Basculegion-F, keeping up momentum and pressuring more passive teams by forcing constant chip damage with their strong pivoting attacks. Despite possessing a great Speed tier, Mienshao is still very easy to revenge kill with faster Pokemon like Gengar, Noivern, and various Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos, making defensive partners that can switch into these revenge killers very valuable. Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon resist all of Mienshao's weaknesses, while Poison-types like Amoonguss can take on Fairy-type attacks from Gardevoir. Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Gengar make for great teammates that support Mienshao by providing speed control.</p>"

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>An incredible Attack stat, offensive typing, and unique coverage options give Golurk a niche as a strong wallbreaker that can dismantle common defensive staples, such as Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Hisuian Goodra. Golurk bears the coveted combination of Dynamic Punch and No Guard, deterring Dark-types like Bisharp and Umbreon from switching in. This, combined with Golurk's Ghost typing, helps it deter Cyclizar from using Rapid Spin for fear of giving it a switch in opportunity, making it a solid option for entry hazard stacking teams as a spinblocker and Stealth Rock setter. Golurk's downfall comes in its terrible Speed and middling bulk, leaving it 2HKOed by a myriad of faster threats, such as Gardevoir, Entei, and Noivern. Golurk's strongest STAB attack, Poltergeist, cannot be used if the target's item is removed by Knock Off, making it somewhat difficult to build around. While its typing is excellent offensively, it also saddles Golurk with a number of common weaknesses, particularly to Water, Ghost, and Dark, with Knock Off being of particular concern. This leaves Golurk vulnerable to many of the tier's premier offensive threats, such as Volcanion, Basculegion-F, Gengar, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos. Golurk also struggles to 2HKO prominent walls like Hippowdon and Chesnaught without the use of Choice Band or Life Orb; the former risks offering the opposing team free switches in by locking Golurk into one move, while the latter's chip damage leaves it even more vulnerable to being KOed by the aforementioned attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers lets Golurk trade power or insurance against Dark-type attacks for sustainability, especially if it opts to run Substitute. A Choice Scarf set can be used to shore up Golurk's low Speed, letting it outspeed offensive checks like Volcanion and non-Choice Scarf Basculegion-F. Close Combat is a stronger alternative to Dynamic Punch that lets Golurk guarantee an OHKO against Moxie Krookodile and a 2HKO against Wo-Chien without the use of a damage-boosting item, though its lack of a positive secondary effect makes Dynamic Punch more preferable otherwise. Golurk can forgo No Guard for Iron Fist in conjunction with Shadow Punch and Ice Punch; the former is a more reliable, if weaker, STAB move that makes it easier for Golurk's teammates to use Knock Off, whereas the latter guarantees an OHKO on Noivern while also dealing extra damage to Chesnaught. If running Choice Band, Golurk can opt to run Trick in order to lure in and cripple defensive checks, like Hippowdon and Chesnaught. Trick can also be used with Klutz and a detrimental item, like Toxic Orb, Flame Orb, or Assault Vest, as an alternative method of crippling its defensive checks; however, Golurk becomes unable to run an item if it runs Klutz, making this option somewhat risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types like Feraligatr, Volcanion, and Gyarados are able to comfortably outspeed Golurk before KOing it with their STAB moves. However, they all struggle to switch in on Golurk's powerful attacks, though Gyarados can take advantage of Choice Band Golurk if it is locked into Earthquake. If Golurk is running Colbur Berry, bulky Water-types like Suicune and Vaporeon are able to avoid being 2HKOed by its attacks and threaten it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Basculegion-F and Gengar are able to outrun Golurk and OHKO it with Shadow Ball, though they must be careful of switching in, especially Gengar due to its weakness to Earthquake. Mimikyu is capable of taking a hit from Golurk thanks to Disguise, letting it set up with Swords Dance to guarantee an OHKO with Shadow Claw.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Without Choice Band, Golurk is unable to 2HKO physical walls like Hippowdon and Chesnaught, both of whom are able to heal off the damage while wearing it down. Chesnaught, in particular, is able to threaten non-Colbur Berry variants with Knock Off, letting it take Golurk's attacks easier. Gligar is unable to be 2HKOed by even Choice Band Golurk's attacks, though it struggles to repeatedly switch in due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Golurk's lacking Speed and bulk leave it vulnerable to being OHKOed or 2HKOed by many of the tier's prominent wallbreakers, such as Gardevoir, Mamoswine, and Galarian Zapdos, though its high power deters many of them from switching in freely.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Golurk is a niche but effective wallbreaker in the tier, using its powerful STAB moves and coverage options to blow holes through defensive cores with ease. Dynamic Punch, with the accuracy assurance granted by No Guard, allows Golurk to disrupt foes that otherwise wall it and hits Dark-types like Umbreon and Krookodile super effectively. Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types like Noivern and Talonflame for massive damage. Substitute allows Golurk to scout, such as for a switch-in or status attempt from Talonflame and Umbreon, safely while also disrupting Sucker Punch from slower Bisharp. Stealth Rock sets are quite effective at establishing entry hazards, as Golurk can threaten common hazard removal options like Cyclizar and Noivern. Choice Band allows Golurk to threaten 2HKOs on foes like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Chesnaught with Stealth Rock chip damage. Life Orb can be used to still hit the Gastrodon 2HKO benchmark without needing to lock into an attack. With a Colbur Berry and the allocated HP investment, Golurk can take a Sucker Punch from +2 Bisharp and a Knock Off from Choice Band Krookodile. No Guard allows Golurk to use its most powerful moves without the risk of missing. The Speed investment allows Golurk to outpace Wo-Chien and uninvested Bisharp. Tera Ground removes the weaknesses to Dark and Ghost while pushing the damage output of Earthquake to near unwallable levels, securing a 2HKO on Hippowdon with Life Orb and after Stealth Rock chip damage. Tera Fighting similarly flips the weakness to Dark, helping non-Colbur Berry sets more effectively take on Bisharp and Krookodile while also increasing the damage of Dynamic Punch enough for Life Orb sets to OHKO Umbreon.</p> <p>With a potent offensive STAB combination of Ghost / Ground, Golurk is an excellent wallbreaker on balance and offense teams. Choice Band sets work best when given safe entry points against walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro, making teammates like Cyclizar, Jirachi, and Galarian Zapdos important to lure them in and allow Golurk to fire off its powerful attacks. Hippowdon and Jirachi are notable teammates for Golurk for their ability to use Stealth Rock so Golurk can opt to run more offensive sets. Life Orb Golurk is susceptible to getting worn down by its own recoil and chip damage, making teammates like Healing Wish Gardevoir and Wish Umbreon especially valuable to maintain its health. Defensively, Golurk appreciates teammates like Cyclizar and Slowbro, as they can sponge the powerful Ghost- and Water-type attacks thrown at it from foes like Basculegion-F, Gengar, and Barraskewda. Offensive teams that rely on Sticky Web support from Ribombee can slow foes like Magnezone and Hisuian Goodra down enough to let Golurk wallbreak more efficiently, though it does activate Defiant on Bisharp, meaning Sticky Web teams should opt for a Colbur Berry to ensure Golurk can survive the Sucker Punch to remove a powerful threat. Substitute Golurk can afford to use Life Orb, especially on Sticky Web teams where it can bait the Sucker Punch from Bisharp and then throw out powerful attacks uncontested, as well as on teams that can give it safe entry points against slower foes like Registeel and Slowbro often.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Bisharp stands out as one of the premier setup sweepers in the metagame due its access to Swords Dance, strong priority in Sucker Punch, and impressive Eviolite-boosted bulk. Coupled with a fantastic defensive typing, Bisharp's bulk allows it to tank attacks from some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, including Cyclizar, Noivern, and Jirachi, and use the turn to set up or strike back with its nigh-unresisted STAB combination. Sucker Punch elevates Bisharp into an incredibly threatening late-game cleaner after just one or two turns to set up, which Bisharp can easily gain through Terastallization. However, Bisharp suffers from a mediocre Speed stat that makes it slower than most other offensive threats and sweepers even with maximum Speed investment. The common Fighting-types in RU, including the likes of Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos, are therefore able to comfortably outspeed and KO Bisharp while taking little damage from Sucker Punch. Physical walls such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught can similarly tank Bisharp's attacks and strike back with super effective attacks. Lastly, Bisharp often finds itself wanting in terms of special bulk even with Eviolite, and it can often be taken out by strong special wallbreakers after minimal chip damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick is a coverage option that can be used over Throat Chop to threaten opposing Bisharp, Registeel, and Crawdaunt more effectively. Tera Ghost gives Bisharp an immunity to Fighting, which can give it a free turn to set up against Fighting-type threats like Mienshao, Hisuian Lilligant, and Galarian Zapdos. The Ghost typing is particularly synergistic with Bisharp, as both of its weaknesses are naturally resisted by Bisharp, and it allows Bisharp to act as a spinblocker in a pinch for entry hazard stacking teams. However, Tera Ghost makes Bisharp weak to Knock Off, which can be very dangerous because it also neuters its bulk by removing Eviolite. Tera Grass combined with Tera Blast provides Bisharp with coverage for Quagsire and Hippowdon while also giving it a resistance to Earthquake. Tera Fairy is another option that provides valuable resistances to Fighting-, Dark-, and Bug-type attacks from the aforementioned Fighting-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: A myriad of Fighting-type wallbreakers, from common presences like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion to niche picks like Lucario and Infernape, can comfortably tank even a +2 Sucker Punch and threaten Bisharp in turn with a KO. Chesnaught is a defensive Fighting-type that can reliably check Bisharp with its high physical bulk. However, all of these Pokemon should be wary of Terastallization, which can give Bisharp free turns to set up against them and potentially turn it into a game-ending threat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Certain physical walls, including Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Body Press Registeel, are able to tank Bisharp's attacks and threaten it with super effective attacks. Unlike Chesnaught, they are usually unafraid of Terastallization due to their access to Whirlwind, Unaware, and Iron Defense, respectively, that can neutralize Bisharp's ability to set up.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong, bulky special attackers such as Volcanion, Magnezone, and Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra are able to threaten Bisharp by targeting its middling special bulk. Magnet Pull Magnezone in particular can trap and eliminate Bisharp if it switches in safely.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Due to Bisharp's low Speed, it is prone to getting outsped and crippled by fast Will-O-Wisp users including Talonflame and Gengar. While Entei does not appreciate taking a +2 Sucker Punch, Sacred Fire from it can cripple even a Terastallized Bisharp.</p>",

Sucker Punch provides strong priority that enables Bisharp to pick off weakened sweepers like Armarouge and improves its ability to clean. Eviolite drastically boosts Bisharp's ability to take hits, which can be invaluable for setting up. Defiant deters opposing Pokemon from using Defog and can potentially turn Bisharp into a deadly threat simply by getting Intimidated by Krookodile or Gyarados or switching into and receiving a stat drop from an attack like Gengar's Shadow Ball. 176 Speed EVs allow Bisharp to outspeed Modest Magnezone. Tera Flying flips Bisharp's matchup against Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, allowing it to stay in on Pokemon such as Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao and use the turn to set up or grab a KO. Tera Dark is an option that instead boosts two of Bisharp's STAB attacks, which can be helpful for guaranteeing certain KOs such as unboosted Sucker Punch against Armarouge and +2 Throat Chop against Empoleon.</p> <p>Swords Dance Bisharp is able to reliably fill the role of a bulky revenge killer and late-game sweeper on both balance and offense structures. Entry hazard stacking teams, with setters such as Krookodile, Jirachi, and Chesnaught, are able to gradually bring the opposing team into range of Bisharp's attacks by wearing them down, thus easing its job as a cleaner. At the same time, Bisharp fills the role of deterring Defog from users like Noivern and Talonflame. Offense, particularly hyper offense, teams can similarly take advantage of Defiant, as hazards like Stealth Rock and Sticky Web set by Pokemon such as Kleavor and Ribombee are likely to stick around. Other setup sweepers like Armarouge, Gyarados, and Mimikyu work well with Bisharp, as they can weaken or take out defensive Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra, Slowbro, and Hippowdon and improve Bisharp's odds of sweeping. Bisharp is simultaneously able to serve as a revenge killer due to its access to Sucker Punch, which can be instrumental in hyper offense mirror matchups for taking care of threats like Armarouge and Gardevoir after they are weakened. A Ghost-type like Mimikyu or Weakness Policy Basculegion-F is also appreciated in these teams to block Rapid Spin from Cyclizar. Lastly, any of the fast Fighting-types in RU, such as Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Terrakion, can easily tank a Sucker Punch and threaten Bisharp with an OHKO. Therefore, teammates that resist Fighting like Talonflame, Slowbro, and Amoonguss can be invaluable partners for Bisharp in bulkier structures to prevent these wallbreakers from making too much progress.</p>"

Terrakion does compete with other Fighting-types though, struggling to fulfill the role with stiff competition like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos, which both have U-turn and Knock Off.

Earthquake helps it deal with Jirachi and is a great option for picking up weakened targets without suffering from the defense drops or inaccuracy from its STAB moves. Quick Attack gives it a form of priority to deal with faster, weakened Pokemon like Cyclizar and Noivern. Justified allows Terrakion to switch into Dark-type attacks and punish moves like Knock Off from Cyclizar to boost its Attack. Tera Blast paired with Tera Ghost gives Terrakion a Ghost-type move that threatens a 2HKO on bulky Psychic-types like Slowbro and Reuniclus. Tera Rock boosts Terrakion's Stone Edge even further, making it very difficult to switch into and guaranteeing a 2HKO on Slowbro. Tera Rock helps Terrakion defensively by removing its weaknesses to Fairy and Psychic and giving it a resistance to Flying-type attacks, making it much better into revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Talonflame. Tera Ghost also removes its weaknesses to Fairy and Psychic, but it also removes its weaknesses to Fighting and Ground, which gives Terrakion an opportunity to take out common Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Galarian Zapdos, and Krookodile. Tera Ghost pairs well with Justified, deterring opposing Pokemon from hitting it with super effective Dark-type attacks in fear of boosting its Attack.</p> <p>Choice Band Terrakion can fit on a plethora of balance and bulky offense teams thanks to its great Speed tier and its excellent power as a wallbreaker. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Chesnaught, Empoleon, and Krookodile can help it pick up 2HKOs on bulky physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro and rack up residual damage on revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Krookodile switching in. Terrakion appreciates pivot support to get it in safely; therefore, Pokemon like Cyclizar and Jirachi can keep up momentum by pivoting on defensive switch-ins like Empoleon and Krookodile and create opportunities for Terrakion to attack. Terrakion appreciates Future Sight support from Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus, as it can use Close Combat more freely while Future Sight punishes Fairy-, Flying- and particularly Poison-types that switch in like Amoonguss, Noivern, and Gardevoir. Lots of common Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao can revenge kill Terrakion, making defensive partners that can switch into the aforementioned Pokemon very valuable. Physical tanks such as Hippowdon and Slowbro and special walls like Empoleon can switch into the revenge killers while offering utility like entry hazards and Rocky Helmet chip damage.

Earthquake acts as an excellent coverage move and allows it to deal with targets such as Jirachi and Golurk easily. Substitute is an alternative that lets Terrakion safely choose whether to set up a Swords Dance or fire off a STAB move after forcing out a Pokemon like Cyclizar or Bisharp. Taunt can be used to stop entry hazards from going up and take away recovery and other status moves from foes such as Hippowdon and Slowbro. Air Balloon earns Terrakion a free turn against Ground-types such as Krookodile and can be used alongside Taunt to completely shut down Hippowdon without Stone Edge. Leftovers is an alternative that allows Terrakion to take better advantage of its decent natural bulk and synergizes particularly well with Substitute. Tera Flying removes its weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, thus giving it opportunities to set up against as well as break checks like Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and Choice Scarf Krookodile.</p> <p>Swords Dance Terrakion fits best on offense structures, particularly hyper offense, due to its ability to threaten the majority of the metagame after a single Swords Dance. It shares many of its defensive checks, like Hippowdon, with other common setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Mimikyu. This means that Terrakion can often be sacrificed to deal good damage to these checks before fainting, which enables the aforementioned sweepers to capitalize on the weakened physical walls to potentially pull off a sweep. Its great Speed tier strengthens its ability to chunk holes in the opposing team by taking advantage of common Pokemon like Jirachi and Krookodile, which can often free up teammates like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Weak Armor Armarouge to clean up late-game. It pairs well with specially offensive wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Gengar and Calm Mind Armarouge, which can KO common Terrakion checks like Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Chesnaught with ease. Terrakion offers valuable support to teammates like Gengar and Maushold that fear Knock Off greatly, as its ability, Justified, acts as a strong deterrent against it. In addition, Terrakion can work well as a cleaner in entry hazard-stacking team structures, which try to wear down opposing teams, alongside setters such as Jirachi, Gligar, and Chesnaught, as many defensive Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Suicune, only need to be chipped marginally to be in Terrakion's KO range after a Swords Dance.</p>"

Rock Blast is generally used over Stone Edge to circumvent opposing Focus Sash leads, including Kleavor, though Terrakion is still unfortunately slower than Froslass and Ribombee. Swords Dance makes Terrakion a major wallbreaking threat, hindering physical walls like Hippowdown, Chesnaught, and Gastrodon that look to dampen Terrakion's impact as an offensive lead. Taunt inhibits opposing hazard leads like Jirachi, setup users such as Slowbro and Suicune, and Defog Noivern. Focus Sash best ensures Terrakion a turn to set up Stealth Rock or attack. Loaded Dice synergizes with Rock Blast, guaranteeing Terrakion can OHKO Kleavor and giving it a better chance to OHKO Mimikyu through its Disguise. Tera Ghost lets Terrakion spinblock, and the additional Fighting immunity can surprise Mienshao and opposing Terrakion.</p> <p>Stealth Rock set up by Terrakion enables other hyper offense staples, including Armarouge and Maushold. Defiant users, such as Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos, are especially noteworthy for punishing Defog users. Armarouge and Gardevoir can also take advantage of Talonflame for Terrakion. Moxie Gyarados particularly appreciates entry hazards chipping down foes so it can more easily start to snowball. Mimikyu is another common pick for hyper offense teams, and its Ghost typing helps preserve Terrakion's hazards against Cyclizar while deterring Maushold. Other Ghost-types, such as Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark, can similarly spinblock, and they pressure Psychic-types like Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Mew for Terrakion.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Terrakion's high Speed and access to perfect coverage mean that it is an ideal Choice Scarf user that outspeeds most other Choice Scarf users in the tier, making it an excellent revenge killer. Earthquake helps it deal with Jirachi and is a great option for picking up weakened targets without suffering from the defense drops or inaccuracy from its STAB moves. Rock Slide gives Terrakion a more reliable Rock-type move to use by trading power for accuracy. Stealth Rock allows Terrakion to act as an entry hazard setter that is able to get it up on Pokemon it forces out like Choice Scarf Krookodile locked into Knock Off. Justified allows Terrakion to switch into Dark-type attacks and punish moves like Knock Off from Cyclizar to boost its Attack. Tera Rock helps Terrakion by boosting its Rock-type moves, helping it clean up versus foes that don't resist Rock and threatening a 2HKO on Amoonguss after Stealth Rock. Tera Ground boosts Earthquake's damage and threatens an 2HKO on Golurk while granting it an immunity to common Thunder Wave support like Reuniclus and Cresselia.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Terrakion fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, as it is a great revenge killer that can outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Krookodile. Chesnaught and Hippowdon make for good partners that offer utility like entry hazards and Rocky Helmet chip damage that weaken the opposing Pokemon and make it easier for Terrakion to clean. Sand Stream Hippowdon can also set up sandstorm for Terrakion, giving it a Special Defense boost and allowing it to switch into special attacks it normally shouldn't. Terrakion struggles into strong physical walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Chesnaught, which can stop it from cleaning, so bulky partners like Noivern, Talonflame, and Wo-Chien are appreciated, as they can take hits for Terrakion and force these walls out. Wallbreakers like Crawdaunt and special attackers like Magnezone and Hisuian Zoroark can also weaken the aforementioned walls while making it much easier for Terrakion to clean up. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Reuniclus makes it harder for physical walls to switch in and particularly punishes Poison-types such as Amoonguss, allowing Terrakion to use its STAB moves more often instead of locking into Earthquake.</p>"

  "Chesnaught": {
    "overview": "<p>Chesnaught is a premier physical wall and Spikes setter in RU. With its great bulk and typing that naturally checks threats like Krookodile, Bisharp, and Rhyperior, it can consistently find opportunities to set up entry hazards and chip away at the opposing team itself. With utility moves like Knock Off and Leech Seed, Chesnaught can support its team throughout the game while serving as a wall for many physical attackers. Chesnaught has a great matchup against the best spinner in the tier, Cyclizar, with the ability to OHKO it should it attempt to remove Spikes. Despite Chesnaught's great matchups against many Pokemon in the tier, its typing leaves it with plenty of poor ones; Mamoswine, Mimikyu, and Entei all hit it for super effective damage, and its 4x weakness to Flying makes it easy prey for Galarian Zapdos, one of the most common physical attackers in the tier. Chesnaught's Special Defense is also low, and it will struggle to take any special attacks it does not resist, making it vulnerable to Pokemon like Gardevoir and Armarouge. Chesnaught also suffers from a poor matchup against the Defog users of the tier, such as Noivern and Talonflame, that can easily prevent Spikes from staying active.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chesnaught can use Seed Bomb or Wood Hammer to take advantage of its Grass typing to hit Ground- and Water-types like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Iron Defense can boost Chesnaught's survivability and the damage of Body Press, allowing it to serve as a potential sweeper. Drain Punch is an alternative Fighting-type move that does less damage but doubles as a source of recovery. Close Combat is another option that does more damage than Body Press, enabling OHKOs on Pokemon like Empoleon, Magnezone, and Hisuian Goodra with some Attack investment, although this hinders Chesnaught's role as a tank. Roar can be used to prevent foes like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Tera Flying Swords Dance Bisharp from setting up. Chesnaught also has access to the incredible setup move Belly Drum, which can make it a very potent setup sweeper should it manage to set up safely. While its Speed is too low to take full advantage of it, Chesnaught can use Trailblaze to boost its Speed or priority Grassy Glide when paired with Grassy Surge Thwackey. Tera Fire grants an immunity to burn, a resistance to Fire, and access to Tera Blast Fire that hits Amoonguss and opposing Chesnaught.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Alolan Ninetales can threaten large damage against Chesnaught, while being able to easily take its attacks. However, both of these can struggle with Knock Off removing their items, and they can be walled by Tera Steel.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Chesnaught's 4x weakness to Flying makes it particularly vulnerable to Brave Bird from Galarian Zapdos or Talonflame and Hurricane from Noivern. While it can Terastallize out of this weakness, the best option to resist those attacks is Steel, which is still hit super effectively by Galarian Zapdos's Close Combat and Noivern's Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Gardevoir, Azelf, Jirachi, and Slowbro all have attacks that Chesnaught is unable to take. While Knock Off helps, these foes will outspeed Chesnaught or have the bulk to tank it. Armarouge poses a particular threat, as Chesnaught's attacks will trigger Weak Armor, and Knock Off will activate Weakness Policy, creating danger for the entire team.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chesnaught is one of the most reliable Spikes setters and provides a solid defensive backbone for its team. Knock Off hits the Ghost- and Psychic-types like Basculegion-F and Slowbro that aren't afraid of Body Press while also making foes like Talonflame and Noivern more susceptible to entry hazards by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Synthesis provides a reliable means for Chesnaught to heal itself, although Hippowdon's Sand Stream will neuter the effectiveness. Leech Seed is a more offensive form of recovery that provides chip damage to Chesnaught's checks and can also heal its allies. Bulletproof provides an immunity to Gengar's Shadow Ball and Amoonguss's Sludge Bomb. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn attackers that want to pivot away from Chesnaught like Cyclizar and Jirachi. 52 Speed EVs allow Chesnaught to outspeed uninvested Bisharp, and 204 Defense EVs guarantee that Body Press OHKOes Terrakion after Spikes. Tera Ghost prevents Cyclizar from using Rapid Spin while also providing Chesnaught an immunity to Fighting, improving its matchup against Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion. Tera Water flips Chesnaught's Fire weakness, allowing it to stand up against Entei and Volcanion. Tera Steel turns the devastating Flying weakness into a resistance to aid against Noivern and Galarian Zapdos, in addition to new resistances to Dragon, Fairy, and Psychic which improve its matchup against Cyclizar, Mimikyu, and Jirachi.</p> <p>Chesnaught can fit comfortably on any team style that needs a defensive presence like balance, bulky offense, or stall. Due to the abundance of Galarian Zapdos, Chesnaught will need to be paired with a physically defensive ally that can comfortably survive or deter its Brave Bird, like Registeel, Slowbro, or Flame Body Talonflame. Special walls like Umbreon, Jirachi, and Empoleon are also important due to Chesnaught's poor ability to check the various special attackers of the tier like Gardevoir and Armarouge. Chesnaught's natural weakness to Flying-types like Noivern and Talonflame will often invite them in and allow it to use Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots, making them vulnerable to Stealth Rock set by Chansey, Registeel, and Rhyperior. Chesnaught is vulnerable to opposing Spikes, so it appreciates hazard removal from allies like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame. Common Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Rhyperior all share a weakness to Volcanion with Chesnaught, meaning that sturdy checks like Noivern and Cyclizar are needed.</p>"

Talonflame is also able to switch into and make progress on relatively passive defensive Pokemon like non-Stone Edge Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and Registeel, especially if it carries Taunt to prevent recovery. Unfortunately, Talonflame's lack of firepower and special bulk can give special attackers like Hisuian Goodra, Armarouge, and Slowbro a free turn to fire off an attack or set up after switching in safely, though the latter can be mitigated by Taunt. Furthermore, Talonflame's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock can pose a problem, as many attackers that it would like to switch in on, like Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos, carry Knock Off, which can remove Heavy-Duty Boots and cripple Talonflame's ability to pivot if Stealth Rock is set up.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp gives Talonflame a more reliable way of crippling physical attackers like Mimikyu, Krookodile, and Bisharp. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gastrodon and setup sweepers like Armarouge and Reuniclus from taking advantage of Talonflame's passivity by safely setting up entry hazards, healing up, or boosting their stats. U-turn allows Talonflame to pivot out to offensive threats like Armarouge, Gardevoir, and Mienshao that can exploit its switch-ins like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Hisuian Goodra. Defog pairs well with Talonflame's ability to force out physical attackers and access to recovery. Roost is important recovery, though Talonflame should be wary of Earthquake from Hippowdon and Krookodile when using it. Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary to allow Talonflame to switch in while Stealth Rock is up. Flame Body is useful for punishing Pokemon like Maushold, Maushold, and Cyclizar. Tera Ground gives Talonflame an immunity to Electric-type attacks from Magnezone and Raikou. Tera Water provides a valuable resistance to Water-type attacks from Barraskewda, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion. Tera Fairy retains Talonflame's important resistances to Bug- and Fighting-type attacks from pivots like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao while allowing it to absorb a Draco Meteor from Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, or Noivern and shrug off Knock Off from Krookodile. All of these options additionally assist Talonflame by removing its glaring Stealth Rock weakness for if Heavy-Duty Boots is removed.</p> <p>Talonflame fits best on offense and balance structures as a pivot and deterrent against physical attacks thanks to Flame Body. Its typing pairs well with specially defensive Pokemon like Umbreon, Wo-Chien, and Hisuian Goodra that fear attacks from Fighting-type wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Gallade. Talonflame's high Speed and access to recovery can provide great value particularly to bulky structures like stall teams, as it can neutralize strong attackers and setup sweepers like Maushold, Bisharp, and niche picks such as Gallade that may be difficult to deal with otherwise. On more offensive structures, U-turn can allow wallbreakers like Armarouge, Hisuian Goodra, and Crawdaunt to safely switch into and threaten Talonflame's defensive checks like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Talonflame's reliability as a fast Defogger is also appreciated by partners such as Galarian Zapdos, Choice Band Entei, and non-Heavy-Duty Boots Gyarados that are vulnerable to entry hazard chip damage.</p>"

Hisuian Goodra's Dragon / Steel typing gives it resistances to STAB attacks from the strongest special attackers in the tier, such as Armarouge and Volcanion, while its high Special Defense allows it to usually shrug off neutral hits as well. Moreover, there are very few Pokemon in the metagame that can slow Hisuian Goodra down from making progress with its Choice Specs set carrying immense power and its defensive set's access to several coverage and utility options such as Knock Off, Acid Spray, and Protect. However, Hisuian Goodra's low Speed stat holds it back quite a bit, rendering it weak to common offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mamoswine and even generally slow Pokemon such as Chesnaught and Golurk. Its lack of reliable recovery also significantly lowers its effectiveness as a defensive sponge, making it vulnerable to getting chipped down by entry hazards and VoltTurn cores over longer games.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An IronPress set with Acid Armor and Body Press can significantly improve Hisuian Goodra's ability to deal with physical attacks and possibly allow it to sweep, though its lack of recovery makes it suboptimal. Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower to trade accuracy for power, notably allowing bulky attacker Hisuian Goodra to 2HKO Jirachi and guaranteeing Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra an OHKO on Bisharp. Thunderbolt allows bulky attacker sets to hit Water-types like Slowbro, Volcanion, and Empoleon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many of the Fighting-type Pokemon in the metagame such as Galarian Zapdos, Gallade, and Mienshao threaten to OHKO Hisuian Goodra.

Calm Mind sweepers such as Slowbro and Reuniclus can also pose problems to Hisuian Goodra if it lacks Acid Spray. While Dragon Tail can phaze many of these sweepers, it fails against Substitute Suicune and Tera Fairy users.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Despite Hisuian Goodra's resistance to Stealth Rock, it is vulnerable to getting chipped down by entry hazards due to its lack of reliable recovery, eventually making it unable to answer special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Basculegion-F and Armarouge.</p>",

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bulky attacker Hisuian Goodra leverages its good natural bulk to consistently tank special attacks and strike back with strong attacks and progress-making moves. Heavy Slam is great for dealing with specially defensive foes such as Blissey and Wo-Chien, while Flash Cannon is better for threatening Mamoswine and Rhyperior. Acid Spray is an alternative that can more consistently take down defensive tanks in combination with Draco Meteor, especially ones that can't threaten Hisuian Goodra back like Umbreon and Slowbro. Knock Off is fantastic for making progress against common switch-ins such as Jirachi, Registeel, and the aforementioned Umbreon, as well as enabling Acid Spray by removing Covert Cloak from common users like Gyarados and Slowbro. Earthquake similarly hits Steel-types as well as key targets such as Empoleon and Volcanion. Flamethrower is an alternative that also helps Hisuian Goodra deal with Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Forretress more easily. Protect is incredibly useful on Leftovers Hisuian Goodra, allowing it to heal up safely while scouting for attacks, especially those from common Choice item users such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile. Dragon Tail is an option that can chip away at switch-ins, especially if entry hazards are set up on the opposing field, and phaze threatening setup sweepers like Gyarados. Although these options are slashed in specific slots, it should be noted that Hisuian Goodra is able to freely mix and match from them to suit the needs of its team. Leftovers is valuable on Hisuian Goodra to make up for its lack of reliable recovery, though Assault Vest can be used to make it a nigh-unbreakable special wall. Sap Sipper allows Hisuian Goodra to wall Grass-types such as Wo-Chien and Amoonguss. Gooey is an alternative that can slow down physical attackers like Jirachi and Maushold to then allow Hisuian Goodra or one of its teammates to outspeed them and strike back, but it should be used with caution due to Galarian Zapdos and Bisharp being very common in the metagame and able to exploit it with Defiant. The given EVs let Hisuian Goodra survive an Earthquake from Jolly Mamoswine; however, similar to its moveset, Hisuian Goodra's EV spread and nature can be altered to suit its desired defensive and offensive capabilities. Tera Fairy flips Hisuian Goodra's weakness to Fighting into a resistance, removes its weakness to Ground, and provides a valuable resistance to Knock Off, enabling it to survive hits from physical wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile and threaten them back with its powerful attacks. Tera Ghost instead provides an immunity to Fighting to help against Fighting-type wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, though Hisuian Goodra should be careful of the acquired weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from common Pokemon such as Krookodile, Bisharp, and Basculegion-F. Tera Water removes Hisuian Goodra's weaknesses while retaining its resistance to Iron Head from Jirachi and Bisharp. Additionally, Tera Water improves Hisuian Goodra's ability to deal with Volcanion and should be combined with Sap Sipper to nullify the Grass weakness it causes Hisuian Goodra to have. However, Tera Water has the caveat of making Hisuian Goodra unable to deal with Electric-types such as Magnezone and Raikou.</p> <p>Hisuian Goodra is a fantastic fit on balance and bulky offense teams as a blanket switch-in to most special attackers in the tier such as Armarouge and Basculegion-F. Physically defensive partners such as Chesnaught, Slowbro, and Hippowdon are practically necessities for Hisuian Goodra, as they can tank attacks from physical wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, Mamoswine, and Krookodile. On top of that, they also serve as Knock Off absorbers, which Hisuian Goodra appreciates due to often being item reliant, particularly if it's holding Leftovers. Hisuian Goodra greatly appreciates entry hazard removal from Noivern or Talonflame, due to its lack of reliable recovery; Cyclizar can also be used, though it can be a suboptimal partner due to overlapping roles and sharing the Fighting weakness with Hisuian Goodra. To similarly make up for Hisuian Goodra's lack of recovery, Wish passers like Umbreon and Jirachi can be valuable teammates. Acid Spray Hisuian Goodra pairs well with strong special attackers like Basculegion-F and Volcanion that can exploit the weakened foe or an unsuspecting switch-in to blow holes in the opposing team. Hisuian Goodra's Knock Off and Dragon Tail can help make progress on hazard-stacking structures, with setters like Krookodile, Jirachi, and Chesnaught, by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the opposing team and chipping away at them through hazards and phazing. Hisuian Goodra can often struggle to stop bulky setup sweepers such as Bisharp, Gyarados, and Suicune; therefore, teammates that can handle them defensively, such as Chesnaught, Umbreon, and Noivern, respectively, as well as those with disruption options, such as Choice Scarf Trick Gardevoir, Encore Jirachi, and Whirlwind Hippowdon, are important to have.</p>"

Flamethrower melts the Steel-types that resist both of Hisuian Goodra's STAB moves such as Jirachi, Magnezone, and Bisharp. Choice Specs boosts Hisuian Goodra's power to stupendous heights, allowing it to pick up OHKOs on the likes of Slowbro and Volcanion that could otherwise stomach a hit from it. Gooey allows Hisuian Goodra to slow down physical attackers, notably crippling Maushold, which can help in late-game situations against wallbreakers such as Gallade and Terrakion. 216 Speed EVs allow Hisuian Goodra to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt and Golurk. Tera Ghost removes Hisuian Goodra's Fighting weakness, allowing it to break through the likes of Terrakion, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao. Tera Dragon boosts the power of Draco Meteor to absurd levels, allowing it to surprise an enemy that could otherwise take the hit, like Revavroom. However, this makes Hisuian Goodra weak to Ice, Fairy and Dragon, meaning it cannot switch in as easily against Pokemon such as Ice Beam Empoleon, Gardevoir, and Noivern, so it's best used in a late-game scenario or once these foes have been KOed.</p> <p>Hisuian Goodra fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to check special threats such as Armarouge and Basculegion-F while giving them offensive firepower to help against bulkier teams. Fast sweepers such as Choice Scarf Gengar, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Barraskewda appreciate Hisuian Goodra's ability to wear down defensive pokemon such as Umbreon, Registeel, and Empoleon early-game in order for them to clean up late-game. Wish support from teammates such as Umbreon and Vaporeon are great for Hisuian Goodra, as they are able to heal off the chip damage that Hisuian Goodra has taken and allow it to continue its assault upon the opposing team. Fighting- and Ground-resistant Pokemon such as Cresselia and Talonflame are great partners, as they are able to take on the Fighting- and Ground-types, like Mienshao, Galarian Zapdos, and Krookodile, that threaten Hisuian Goodra and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, massively increasing Hisuian Goodra's survivability in order for it to chunk the opposition more often. Other physically defensive teammates such as Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Hippowdon are also great partners for Hisuian Goodra, similarly taking the strong physical hits that are aimed at it while being able to support it by spreading status and setting entry hazards. Gardevoir is a good offensive and defensive partner to Hisuian Goodra, as it is able to switch into the Fighting-type moves that threaten Hisuian Goodra. In return, Hisuian Goodra is easily able to switch into and take advantage of the Steel-types that check them like Jirachi and Empoleon. Pivots such as Cyclizar and Jirachi can bait in physical walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Chesnaught and pivot into Hisuian Goodra, which can then freely fire off a powerful attack.</p>"

Prankster Thunder Wave deters most setup sweepers and fast Pokemon from taking advantage of its passivity and can neutralize threats to its team such as Terrakion, Armarouge, and Galarian Zapdos. However, Klefki is quite passive, and Pokemon like Reuniclus and Bisharp can shrug off its attacks easily and use it as setup fodder. Outside of Spikes and Thunder Wave, it faces stiff competition from the tier's numerous Steel-types such as Jirachi, Registeel, and Hisuian Goodra; while Jirachi and Registeel are particularly effective at setting up Stealth Rock, all three are capable of offensively threatening opposing teams.

Air Balloon allows it to switch into these Ground-types directly, which is particularly useful for checking Choice-locked Ground-types like Mamoswine. Alternatively, Leftovers provides Klefki with its only source of recovery. A physically defensive spread lets it more effectively check the plethora of physical threats like Mimikyu and Jirachi. Tera Ghost lets it wall most Normal- and Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Maushold and spinblock Cyclizar.</p> <p>Klefki typically appears on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Spikes support. Partners that benefit from Spikes, such as Terrakion, Galarian Zapdos, and Gengar, appreciate their checks being whittled down throughout the match. Knock Off users and pivots, like Galarian Zapdos and Cyclizar, help Klefki's Spikes rack up more damage by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and forcing repeated switches. Due to its lack of recovery, Klefki can crumble under chip damage, notably from entry hazards, so Rapid Spin users like Cyclizar and Forretress can help by removing them while keeping Spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Rhyperior and Flygon can switch into common Fire- and Ground-types for Klefki. Pokemon that can threaten bulky setup sweepers, like Choice Specs Gengar, alleviate Klefki's propensity to become setup fodder. Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Krookodile can form hazard-stacking cores with Klefki to force switches and rack up passive damage.</p>"

  "Noivern": {
    "overview": "<p>Noivern swoops into RU as a premier speedy Pokemon that can fill both offensive and defensive roles. Due to Noivern's resistance to common offensive types like Fire, Water, and Fighting, it can be a great defensive sponge by switching into both special and physical attackers such as Volcanion and Gallade. It can then use this opportunity to remove entry hazards with Defog, chunk a switch-in with either Super Fang or Draco Meteor, or pivot on switch-ins with U-turn. It can outspeed and force out Pokemon such as Cyclizar, Gengar, and Raikou, threatening them with Draco Meteor. Noivern can keep itself healthy with Roost, allowing it to come in multiple times per game in order to do its job. However, Noivern struggles with common Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos, as they can outspeed and deal massive damage to it. Noivern can also struggle a lot with Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Gardevoir, which can switch into its main STAB option in Draco Meteor and hit it super effectively. Noivern also immensely struggles with bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon, Jirachi, and Registeel, as they can easily switch into it and either make progress against it or set up on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs with Boomburst and Tera Normal is an option on Noivern, allowing it to do massive damage to the opposing team once Steel- and Ghost-types have been removed. Switcheroo can be used alongside Choice Specs to cripple defensive Pokemon that Noivern can't break through, such as Chansey or Empoleon. Air Slash is a much more reliable STAB option than Hurricane, though it is much weaker and can fail to 2HKO even Pokemon with mediocre special bulk like Krookodile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Tera Fairy users like Armarouge and Cresselia are massive pains for Noivern, as they can switch into its main STAB option in Draco Meteor. Mimikyu in particular is extremely irritating for defensive Noivern, as it is immune to both Draco Meteor and Super Fang, meaning it can switch into any defensive Noivern set lacking Hurricane or Psychic Noise without taking any damage and threaten it out.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Noivern can struggle against Steel-types such as Jirachi, Magnezone, and Empoleon, since they can switch into Draco Meteor easily, only really fearing Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Priority</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir, Gengar, and Galarian Zapdos can outspeed Noivern and threaten it immensely. Priority users such as Bisharp, and especially Mamoswine, can do big damage to Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: Umbreon is a big pain for Noivern, as Umbreon can easily take its attacks, use Wish to heal off its damage, and threaten it with Toxic. Taunt can prevent Umbreon from using Toxic against Noivern, but Foul Play still forces Noivern to use Roost repeatedly.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Draco Meteor provides Noivern with tremendous breaking power, though it does allow Fairy-types such as Gardevoir safe entry points against it; alternatively, Hurricane can be used to hit these Fairy-types, though they are quite scarce and it comes at the cost of less immediate power and unreliable accuracy. Flamethrower melts the pesky Steel-types that resist Noivern's STAB attacks, like Jirachi, Magnezone, and Registeel. U-turn can be used to form VoltTurn cores and provide safe pivots into teammates like Galarian Zapdos; Taunt is an alternative move that can stop setup attempts from Pokemon like Reuniclus and Slowbro, recovery attempts, and entry hazard stacking from walls like Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Roost gives Noivern the longevity needed to stick around and dish out damage while checking big threats like Basculegion-F and Volcanion. Frisk can be used to scout for items, such as Choice items on Pokemon like Mamoswine and Gengar. Infiltrator allows Noivern to hit Pokemon that use Substitute, such as Raikou and Suicune, to prevent them from using Calm Mind freely. Tera Steel can be used to flip the weakness to Dragon, which helps against Hisuian Goodra and opposing Noivern, while providing valuable resistances to Fairy-type attacks from Gardevoir and Cresselia. Tera Fire also provides a Fairy resistance and can bolster the damage of Flamethrower, allowing Noivern to break through Jirachi and Magnezone more effectively. Tera Fairy provides a Dragon immunity, which helps against Cyclizar and opposing Noivern, while maintaining the Bug and Fighting resistances to still check Mienshao. Tera Fairy also provides a key resistance to Dark-type attacks like Knock Off and Sucker Punch, making matchups into Bisharp and Krookodile more comfortable. Tera Water is a fine pick for Noivern, as it maintains the Fire and Water resistances to check Volcanion while providing an Ice resistance to more effectively deal with Mamoswine.</p> <p>Offensive pivot Noivern is a great choice on balance and bulky offense teams that need to shore up their matchups into one of the biggest threats in the tier, Volcanion. Teammates like Talonflame are much appreciated, as they can provide entry hazard removal and check physical attackers like Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos, threatening to burn either with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp. In return, Noivern can check Volcanion for Talonflame. Physical wallbreakers that can use the safe entry points provided by U-turn Noivern, such as Crawdaunt and Mamoswine, are valuable to help break through walls such as Chansey and Hisuian Goodra, making Noivern more imposing with its own strong attacks. Noivern appreciates its own hazard support from teammates like Hippowdon and Jirachi, which can help rack up chip damage while Noivern uses either U-turn to pivot between teammates or Taunt to prevent recovery. Noivern is a great member of VoltTurn cores, partnering with powerful wallbreakers like Magnezone and Mienshao to keep the opposition from getting comfortable. Steel-type teammates like Empoleon, Jirachi, and Registeel are valuable to check Dragon- and Fairy-types that can threaten Noivern, like Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Ninetales, and Gardevoir.</p>"

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Draco Meteor allows Noivern to dent naturally bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Hippowdon even without Special Attack investment. Hurricane can be used over Draco Meteor; however, it is less reliable and doesn't threaten Cyclizar as much. Super Fang allows Noivern to make incredible progress against common switch-ins like Jirachi and Registeel. Taunt allows that damage to stick, preventing recovery attempts from Pokemon such as Empoleon and Umbreon while also preventing Thunder Wave from the likes of Slowbro. Defog provides excellent team support, preventing teammates from being chipped by entry hazards. Psychic Noise prevents any form of recovery and does decent damage to Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Volcanion, though it notably fails against Umbreon. Roost allows Noivern to stay healthy throughout a game to make more progress with a combination of Super Fang and Taunt or Psychic Noise. Tera Steel turns Noivern's Fairy-type weakness into a resistance, allowing it to check threats such as Gardevoir and Cresselia. Tera Fairy gives it a Dark-type resistance and a Dragon-type immunity, allowing it to emergency check threats such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Choice-locked Hisuian Goodra in a pinch. Tera Water allows Noivern to check Mamoswine and Alolan Ninetales as well, while retaining the ability to check Fire- and Water-types such as Volcanion and Barraskewda.</p> <p>Noivern fits well on balance and bulky offense teams, working as a crucial defensive piece and checking Pokemon like Volcanion. It loves partnering with entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, Chesnaught, and Quagsire to further suffocate foes with Taunt or Psychic Noise. Noivern also partners well with Reuniclus, as they form a tough Fighting-resistant core that wears the opponent down with entry hazards and Psychic Noise. It also loves partnering with Steel-type Pokemon such as Jirachi and Registeel, checking common Fire- and Fighting- types like Volcanion and Mienshao for them, while they cover its Ice and Fairy weaknesses. Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos enjoy Noivern's ability to chip the opposition so that they can clean up with ease. Fighting-types like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos enjoy Noivern's ability to batter away at Fighting-resistant foes like Gardevoir. Similarly, special attackers like Armarouge and Gengar really enjoy Taunt Noivern's ability to shut down Umbreon. Rotom-H and Slowbro are great teammates that check Mamoswine, one of the biggest threats to Noivern.</p>"

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcanion is one of the most potent wallbreakers available, making use of its strong STAB moves and diverse coverage options to rip through bulkier team structures. While it does struggle with longevity and Speed, the pure strength in wallbreaking power that it can provide a team makes up for these issues, with proper teambuilding further patching up these holes. Threatening defensive tier staples like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Amoonguss, as well as nuking more fragile options with ease, Volcanion's offensive capabilities cannot be understated. Additionally, while mainly used in an offensive manner, Volcanion can also provide an out against rain teams thanks to Water Absorb, which also allows it to be a decent switch-in to Scald users like Slowbro and Suicune. Volcanion most often runs Heavy-Duty Boots, which provides it much-needed tenure in the face of Stealth Rock and entry-hazard stacking playstyles. Although Volcanion is powerful, there is reliable counterplay against it, with options like Knock Off from Cyclizar being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. In addition to this, Dragon-types, most notably Noivern and Hisuian Goodra, and bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Empoleon leverage their utility and advantaged typing against it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Spin can be slotted over Flamethrower to trap specially defensive walls like Chansey and Milotic alongside running Taunt over an offensive option to deny their recovery. Roar can be used to prevent  foes such as Suicune and Rest Gyarados from using Volcanion as setup fodder. Both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf are options to turn Volcanion into a nuke or fix its below-average Speed, respectively. Its Tera types can fluctuate from the norm, slotting Tera Water for more power from Steam Eruption or Tera Ground to boost the power of Earth Power, provide an immunity to Electric, and create a more impactful synergy with Water Absorb. Tera Blast can give Volcanion an additional offensive option that can help it break through previous checks or counters, with examples like Tera Blast Fairy allowing Volcanion to break through Cyclizar and Noivern or Tera Blast Dark to deal with Slowbro and other Psychic-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Volcanion doesn't appreciate the loss of Heavy-Duty Boots, which puts it in jeopardy against Stealth Rock and entry hazard stacking playstyles. Cyclizar in particular can switch in on Volcanion that lack Body Press and freely remove its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Cyclizar and Noivern resist all of Volcanion's STAB options and can easily threaten it with their own attacks. While Volcanion often runs a coverage move to hit Hisuian Goodra super effectively, it can still serve as a stalwart check due to its powerful attacks and high special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Mirror Matchups and Water-types</strong>: Without Earth Power, Volcanion gets checked well by opposing Volcanion. In a broader view, Water-types as a whole check Volcanion's STAB options well, only fearing a potential burn from Steam Eruption or Flamethrower that might hinder their future longevity. Taunt can assist with this issue, beating walls like Milotic and Empoleon in the long term by denying their recovery options, and it can provide more opportunities for Volcanion to spread burns with Steam Eruption.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Through options like Body Press, Earth Power, and Sludge Bomb, Volcanion is able to more readily deal with foes that resist its primary STAB moves in Steam Eruption and Flamethrower. Body Press and Earth Power cover very common checks to Volcanion, with Body Press dealing with the omnipresent Cyclizar and Earth Power providing a way to hit opposing Volcanion for super effective damage. While Sludge Bomb is not as noticeably potent against its checks, the value of being able to fish for poison against near stonewall counters like Noivern cannot be understated. Taunt can be slotted in over one of Volcanion's offensive options to break through more defensive foes, denying the option of recovery, including, but not limited to, Slowbro's Slack Off and Empoleon's Roost; these foes are able to absorb Volcanion's attacks naturally with their bulk. Heavy-Duty Boots increases Volcanion's overall longevity in the face of a tier ruled by entry hazards. Water Absorb allows for legitimate utility that isn't usually seen with other wallbreakers, providing a valuable matchup against rain teams, denying pivoting or strong boosted Water-type STAB moves from the likes of Barraskewda, Kingdra, and Basculegion-F. Maximizing Special Attack investment and a Modest nature allows Volcanion to deal huge damage even to Pokemon that resist its attacks, and it runs enough Speed investment to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt. The rest of the available EVs are allotted towards HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk. Tera types are flexible on Volcanion, but generally, Ghost and Fairy are the most applicable, as they provide very sound matchups against tier staples like Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile while also providing a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost denies Rapid Spin from Cyclizar, one of Volcanion's primary checks, as well as gaining an immunity to the wide array of Fighting-type moves in the tier. Fairy is a great type defensively and can deny options like Draco Meteor from Cyclizar and Noivern, forcing them to rely on more inaccurate or weaker moves in order to deal meaningful damage to Volcanion. Tera Dark can allow it to stonewall one of the best progress makers in the tier, Slowbro, by not only blocking Scald due to Water Absorb but also any of Slowbro's Psychic-type STAB options like Psyshock and Psychic Noise. Being able to also blank many of the strong Psychic-types in the tier, like Gardevoir and Armarouge, with Tera Dark is always an invaluable trait to have.</p> <p>Most of the time, Volcanion fits on balanced team compositions where it can take advantage of more defensive play in order to keep itself healthy throughout a match. Volcanion struggles with not having any form of reliable recovery, so it benefits from teammates that can pivot it into foes it matches up well against. Additionally, Wish passing is incredibly powerful support for Volcanion, fixing its main weakness of longevity. Jirachi is able to provide pivoting and Wish passing for Volcanion, making it a great teammate for Volcanion; it can also spread paralysis through Body Slam or Thunder Wave, providing a remedy for Volcanion's lackluster Speed. For a more offensive pivot, Galarian Zapdos serves as an option to support Volcanion's offensive presence, creating powerful synergy that can take advantage of each other's weaknesses. Galarian Zapdos is able to pivot out on its checks, primarily those that have extreme physical bulk but are vulnerable to Volcanion's strong special offense, like Hippowdon and Quagsire. Inversely, Galarian Zapdos is immune to Ground-type moves from threats to Volcanion like Krookodile. Entry hazard stacking teams can also benefit from Volcanion, with the passive chip damage from both Stealth Rock and Spikes creating larger openings for Volcanion's wallbreaking capabilities; as such, pairing it up with Klefki, Chesnaught, or Palossand is beneficial.</p>"

Ribombee's ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Cyclizar, Noivern, and Maushold is invaluable, as it can threaten them with either Moonblast or Stun Spore, which cripples them immensely. It is able to leverage its high Speed in order to reliably get up Sticky Web, which can support slow wallbreakers such as Gallade, Armarouge, and Feraligatr in order to sweep effectively. Ribombee can also utilize a wide variety of support moves in order to cripple the opposing team such as Trick and Stun Spore, which is incredibly useful due to its ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Noivern, Maushold and Gengar. Ribombee is mainly held back by its inability to damage Steel-types like Registeel and Empoleon and its difficulty dealing with Talonflame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quiver Dance can make Ribombee much more threatening, as not only can it allow it to outspeed Talonflame to ensure it can get off a Sticky Web, it can also be kept around until late game once Steel-types such as Registeel and Empoleon have been dealt with to clean up a team. Tera Blast Ground can be used to deal big damage to the Steel-types that commonly wall it such as Hisuian Goodra and Magnezone. Choice Specs is an option alongside Trick in order to cripple foes such as Talonflame and Empoleon while dealing impressive damage against neutral targets. Choice Scarf can be used alongside a Modest nature to make Ribombee an effective revenge killing option against Galarian Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame is a great check to Ribombee, as it can outspeed it and Defog away its Sticky Web.

Psychic Noise deals with Poison-types such as Amoonguss very effectively while also making sure that Ribombee cannot be used as setup fodder by bulky Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Calm Mind Slowbro. Focus Sash ensures Ribombee can get off Sticky Web and lets it have a chance to use a second move in order to further cripple the foe. Shield Dust ensures that Ribombee isn't affected by the secondary effects of moves such as Iron Head from Choice Scarf Jirachi in order to reliably get up Sticky Web. Tera Ghost allows Ribombee to act as a temporary spinblocker if needed against Cyclizar and Forretress.</p> <p>Ribombee fits best on hyper offense teams, where it can lead off games in order to get off Sticky Webs. Ghost-type partners such as Basculegion-F and Mimikyu pair well with Ribombee, as they can spinblock for it and stop Sticky Web from being removed. Defiant Pokemon such as Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos also pair well with Ribombee, as they can punish Defog attempts from Noivern and Talonflame, though they do have to be careful of the Will-O-Wisp that Talonflame usually uses. Slow, strong wallbreakers such as Gallade, Armarouge, and Breloom love Ribombee's Sticky Web, as they can use it to outspeed faster foes they might otherwise struggle with such as Maushold and Krookodile.</p>"

Thanks to Tough Claws and a solid offensive typing, it can smash through defensive staples like Umbreon and Reuniclus as well as pick off weakened offensive threats like Gengar and Gardevoir with priority. Its wide variety of coverage moves also makes it somewhat difficult to answer defensively, as it can break through common walls like Amoonguss with Psychic Fangs or Slowbro with Crunch. However, Lycanroc-D is prone to being worn down by physically bulky Pokemon, most notably Rocky Helmet Hippowdon—especially if it takes chip damage from Life Orb and entry hazards as well. Its poor bulk also makes it vulnerable to getting picked off by faster threats that can take on its somewhat weak priority, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile. Lycanroc-D also struggles against opposing priority: Barraskewda can naturally outspeed Lycanroc-D and KO it with Aqua Jet, while Bisharp resists both Accelerock and Sucker Punch, letting it use its own Sucker Punch safely.

Accelerock provides crucial priority that helps in revenge killing deadly sweepers like Armarouge and Gyarados. Tough Claws Close Combat deals immense damage to physical walls like Hippowdon and crushes Krookodile. Crunch deals with the tier's many Psychic-type Pokemon, particularly Slowbro. Choice Band allows Lycanroc-D to threaten the likes of Chesnaught and Slowbro with the slightest bit of chip damage such as that from entry hazards. Life Orb scores an OHKO on important targets such as Umbreon after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fighting lets Close Combat 2HKO Hippowdon and Chesnaught, while Tera Dark Crunch OHKOes Slowbro with slight chip damage from hazards. It also gives Lycanroc-D a Psychic immunity, allowing it to switch into Psychic-type moves from the likes of Cresselia and Choice-locked Gardevoir.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on bulky offense teams that have a lot of pivots to bring it in safely against Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Umbreon. Thus, specially offensive Pokemon such as Noivern, Basculegion-F, and Magnezone make great teammates, and they also threaten checks to Lycanroc-D such as Chesnaught and Hippowdon. Physical sweepers such as Mimikyu and Maushold appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to weaken physical walls like the aforementioned Hippowdon as well as Chesnaught. Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Jirachi, Slowbro, and Rotom-H slow down Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Gengar, and Noivern to prevent Lycanroc-D from getting revenge killed. Cyclizar and the aforementioned Noivern provide entry hazard removal support, which is particularly valuable for Life Orb Lycanroc-D variants, preventing it from getting further chipped by hazards. Lycanroc-D also enjoys Knock Off support from the likes of Cyclizar, Chesnaught, and Galarian Zapdos for removing any potential Rocky Helmet. Due to its tendency to be easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos, defensive Pokemon like Jirachi and Hippowdon are appreciated, with the latter's Sand Stream also boosting Lycanroc-D's Special Defense, letting it survive a hit in a pinch.</p>"

Close Combat is Lycanroc-D's strongest move due to Tough Claws and hits Steel-types such as Bisharp and Registeel. Accelerock is good against fast Rock-weak foes, such as Talonflame and Noivern, and can hit foes without them using an attacking move, allowing it to catch foes switching in or using a status move such as Roost from Talonflame, Encore from Maushold, or Trick from Scarf Gengar and Gardevoir. Sucker Punch does more damage against neutral targets such as Barraskweda and the likes of Slowbro and Reuniclus while OHKOing Choice Scarf Gengar and Basculegion-F from full. Life Orb boosts Lycanroc-D's power level to be able to get crucial rolls such as getting an OHKO on Krookodile after an Intimidate. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat to obscene levels; after a Swords Dance, it will OHKO Chesnaught and has good odds to OHKO Hippowdon. Tera Dark boosts the power of Sucker Punch, meaning at +2, it can always OHKO Slowbro.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D can fit on offense teams ranging from bulky offense to hyper offense, as they appreciate its ability to heavily damage walls such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon after a boost, and its access to priority means it can revenge kill faster threats such as weakened Dragon Dance Gyarados and Noivern. Lycanroc-D pairs well with other physically offensive cleaners such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, as they can wear down their shared checks such as Slowbro and Hippowdon in order for one of them to sweep late-game. Lycanroc-D is so naturally powerful that it can be used as a fast revenge killer or late-game cleaner without a boost. Lycanroc-D appreciates special wallbreakers such as Armarouge and Basculegion-F that can threaten its defensive checks such as Slowbro and Chesnaught. Lycanroc-D likes to be paired with pivot move users, such as Basculegion-F, Talonflame, Noivern, Empoleon, and Gligar, as they can not only chip down its checks in Hippowdon and Chensaught but also bring it in safely against Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon, which would otherwise be a struggle due to Lycanroc-D's poor bulk and limited resistances. Lycanroc-D appreciates entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Klefki, as the extra chip damage from their hazards can push targets into range to be KOed by Lycanroc-D; for example, Hippowdon is OHKOed by +2 Tera Fighting Close Combat after Stealth Rock. Healing Wish users such as Jirachi and Gardevoir are great partners to Lycanroc-D, as they allow it to come back after being worn down from chip damage from sources like Life Orb and entry hazards.</p>"

  "Palossand": {
    "overview": "<p>With a rare defensive typing as well as access to reliable recovery in Shore Up, Palossand carves out a niche as a Stealth Rock setter that can block Rapid Spin attempts from Cyclizar. Palossand's solid natural bulk lets it tank anything Cyclizar throws at it and take on dangerous physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos, Entei, and Jirachi, threatening the latter two with Scorching Sands. However, Palossand often finds itself 2HKOed by dangerous wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Feraligatr; while it can threaten them with Scorching Sands, Palossand will find itself at their mercy if they find a safe entry point against it. Palossand's passivity means that many of the Pokemon it's supposed to check, like Cyclizar and Galarian Zapdos, can pivot out on it with U-turn, letting the aforementioned wallbreakers come in on it safely; this also means that setup sweepers like Suicune can use it as fodder to rack up boosts. As a defensive Ground-type capable of setting Stealth Rock, Palossand competes directly with Hippowdon and Rhyperior; the former has much better overall bulk while also being able to phaze setup sweepers with Whirlwind, while the latter lacks reliable recovery but has a much stronger offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rocky Helmet allows Palossand to better wear down physical attackers like Galarian Zapdos as well as punish U-turn attempts from pivots like Cyclizar or Jirachi. Hex can be used as an alternative to Shadow Ball on teams that rely on statusing the opponent's team, in addition to synergizing well with Scorching Sands, though Shadow Ball's reliable power makes it preferred in most other scenarios. Sludge Bomb targets Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Hisuian Lilligant, in addition to its poison chance making it easier to wear them down. However, it's quite situational outside of hitting Grass-types and requires Palossand to give up a STAB move in order to run it. Palossand can forgo Scorching Sands' burn chance for Earth Power's higher base power, guaranteeing a 2HKO on Bisharp and offensive Empoleon, though Palossand's passivity means that it usually prefers Scorching Sands' ability to spread burns. Palossand can lure in and cripple defensive Pokemon like Umbreon and Wo-Chien with a Choice Specs Trick set; however, Palossand's passivity makes it sub-optimal offensively, rendering it dead weight until Choice Specs is removed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Suicune and Gyarados can take just about anything Palossand throws at them, taking advantage of its passivity to rack up multiple boosts in preparation for a sweep. While Suicune dislikes being burned by Scorching Sands, Gyarados's immunity to the move makes it public enemy number one for Palossand. Volcanion and Basculegion-F are also able to threaten it offensively by targeting its lower Special Defense stat, though they must be mindful of Scorching Sands and Shadow Ball, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Wo-Chien resists both Scorching Sand and Shadow Ball and can wear Palossand down with Leech Seed, Knock Off, and Ruination. Umbreon similarly doesn't mind Palossand's attacks and can cripple it with Toxic, while Krookodile and Bisharp threaten it offensively. However, aside from Wo-Chien, none of these Pokemon appreciate being burned by Scorching Sands.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Palossand's poor special bulk means that strong special attackers, like Noivern, Gengar, Armarouge, and Gardevoir, threaten to OHKO or 2HKO it. However, all but Noivern struggle to switch in on Palossand's STAB moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Palossand's good bulk, access to reliable recovery, and Ghost typing let it act as a Stealth Rock setter that can stop Cyclizar from freely using Rapid Spin. Scorching Sands lets Palossand burn and cripple physical attackers, particularly those that could otherwise come in on it freely, like Krookodile and Maushold. Shore Up lets Palossand stay healthy throughout the game and has a bonus effect of letting it exploit Sand Stream Hippowdon thanks to its ability to heal more HP under sand. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Palossand less reliant on Shore Up, letting it utilize its other moves more easily. Colbur Berry can instead be used as a safeguard against Knock Off from the likes of Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos, letting Palossand check them more easily. Tera Water is a solid defensive typing that lets Palossand use Water Compaction more easily, turning it into a solid check against Water-type attackers like Gyarados and Feraligatr. It also turns Palossand's Ice weakness into a resistance, letting it check Mamoswine. Tera Fairy is an alternative that grants Palossand a resistance to Knock Off from Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos, while its Dragon immunity lets it take on non-Flash Cannon Hisuian Goodra in a pinch. Tera Poison grants it an immunity to Umbreon's Toxic and Alolan Muk's Poison Touch, preventing it from being crippled by chip damage. Tera Poison also lets Palossand check Mimikyu and Hisuian Lilligant by granting it a neutrality to Ghost and a resistance to Fairy for the former and a resistance to Grass while maintaining its Fighting resistance for the latter.</p> <p>Palossand's ability to block Rapid Spin and set Stealth Rock means that it finds itself right at home on entry hazard stack and balance teams. Spikes users such as Mew and Chesnaught appreciate Palossand keeping their hazards up against Cyclizar, with Chesnaught in particular making for a good partner due to its ability to check Dark-types like Krookodile and Bisharp. Cyclizar itself makes for a solid teammate thanks to its ability to check Ghost- and Water-types, like Basculegion-F and Volcanion, while appreciating Palossand's ability to deter Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos from freely using Close Combat. Colbur Berry variants also appreciate Cyclizar removing hazards on its team's side while also keeping up Palossand's Stealth Rock. Palossand's lacking special bulk means that specially defensive Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra, Wo-Chien, and Blissey pair well with it, appreciating Palossand's ability to shore up their own defensive shortcomings. The former two are able to check Water-types like Slowbro and Basculegion-F, while the latter keeps Gengar in check and appreciates not having to run Stealth Rock itself. Umbreon makes for a fantastic partner due to its ability to check Gyarados, one of Palossand's best counters, as well as its ability to stop opposing Ghost-types like Gengar and Basculegion-F while wearing down the opposition with Toxic. In return, Palossand checks dangerous Fighting-types like Terrakion for it. On hazard stack teams, offensive powerhouses like Gardevoir and Volcanion can use Taunt and Encore users, such as Noivern and Jirachi, respectively, to find switch-in opportunities. In exchange, Palossand is able to wear down the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Scorching Sand burns while also checking opposing offensive threats, like Galarian Zapdos and Maushold.</p>"

  "Mimikyu": {
    "overview": "<p>Mimikyu holds an interesting place in the tier, as its excellent ability and good STAB combination help gear it towards offensive structures as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Disguise gives Mimikyu a free turn that it can use to reliably set up Swords Dance. Disguise can also be used to revenge kill opposing Pokemon or force them out with Red Card, making Mimikyu a rather consistent answer to setup sweepers. Mimikyu is mainly held back by its mediocre stats; a low base Attack for its role leaves Mimikyu really struggling to break through some bulky Pokemon even at +2 like Hippowdon and Registeel. Most of its defensive utility comes from its ability, so setting up Swords Dance can be difficult with its low base HP after Disguise is broken. Its mediocre Speed and frailty make it prone to being revenge killed by faster threats that don't mind taking Shadow Sneak, such as Entei, Galarian Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Krookodile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wood Hammer helps Mimikyu break past physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Quagsire, but the recoil can greatly wear down Mimikyu, especially if it's holding Life Orb. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types that can take a hit from Mimikyu like Bisharp, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra while recovering any recoil from Life Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Common physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Quagsire can tank hits from Mimikyu and wear it down with Rocky Helmet chip damage or cripple it with attacks or status.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Getting burnt from Talonflame's Flame Body, Entei's Sacred Fire, or Slowbro's Scald can cripple Mimikyu's already mediocre damage output and make it pretty easy to take care of.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Mimikyu occupies a unique place in the metagame as a setup sweeper and late-game cleaner that is used primarily because of the utility provided by its ability, Disguise, rather than purely because of its firepower. Since there are no viable Mold Breaker Pokemon in the tier, Disguise almost always guarantees Mimikyu a free turn to set up Swords Dance, which is incredibly valuable. Life Orb provides Mimikyu with much-needed extra firepower that can come in handy when attempting to dispatch offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Kleavor or sweep after a Swords Dance. Red Card is an alternative that offers insurance by phazing out bulkier threats and setup sweepers that Mimikyu may not be able to easily take out such as Calm Mind Suicune, Swords Dance Bisharp, and Dragon Dance Gyarados; it also has the added possibility of bringing in a Pokemon like Cyclizar or Noivern that Mimikyu could use as setup fodder, in return for decreasing its damage. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed ensures that Mimikyu can outspeed a large chunk of the tier and, in particular, Kleavor and Krookodile. Tera Ghost strengthens Mimikyu's power as a sweeper and allows it to dish out heavy-hitting Shadow Sneak at +2, which can clean worn-down Pokemon like Noivern, Galarian Zapdos, and Gardevoir.</p> <p>Mimikyu fits best on hyper offense and offensive structures that rely on setup sweepers and strong attackers to overwhelm the opposing team and thus may not have the defensive resources necessary to easily take out a fast revenge killer or prevent a reverse sweep. Other notable setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Gyarados pair well with Mimikyu by chunking holes in the opposing team and possibly removing some of its key defensive checks such as Hippowdon and Talonflame, thus bolstering Mimikyu's ability to clean late-game. Mimikyu can act as a decent spinblocker against teams reliant on Cyclizar for entry hazard removal. It also appreciates its own hazards support, thus pairing well with Stealth Rock leads such as Kleavor and Terrakion, as they ease Mimikyu's job as a cleaner by wearing out the opposing team, which brings them closer to KO range after a Swords Dance. Mimikyu synergizes well with Future Sight users such as Slowbro and Reuniclus, as it prevents some Poison-type checks like Amoonguss from switching in. Status spreader partners such as Thunder Wave Slowbro and Will-O-Wisp Talonflame can cripple offensive threats such as Armarouge, Kleavor, and Galarian Zapdos, which gives Mimikyu more opportunities to pull off a sweep.</p>"

  "Necrozma": {
    "overview": "<p>Necrozma is a decent Psychic-type Pokemon that has unique set diversity, capable of running a plethora of coverage and utility moves. Stealth Rock Necrozma is a notable lead for offensive structures, as it can break through a lot of balance staples that other leads like Kleavor and Terrakion might struggle against, like Hippowdon, Hisuian Goodra, Jirachi, and Chesnaught. Necrozma has solid natural bulk that is amplified by Prism Armor, minimizing the damage taken from U-turn and Sucker Punch from threats like Galarian Zapdos and Bisharp. Dragon Dance and Calm Mind variants can pick what coverage attacks they need, like Earthquake, Knock Off, Earth Power, and Heat Wave, with Calm Mind sets generally running Moonlight to give Necrozma reliable recovery to stick around after setting up. Necrozma does often struggle to find a slot on teams given the bevy of Psychic-types in the tier it competes with, like Jirachi, Reuniclus, and Slowbro, though it has exceptional offensive capabilities on structures that the other Psychic-types lack like ways to hit Steel-types consistently. While Necrozma is not exactly lacking in Speed, it can be a bit slow at times, failing to outspeed foes that Armarouge and Jirachi do and limiting the number of foes it can KO. Necrozma also struggles to combat the priority in the tier, notably taking super effective damage from Bisharp Sucker Punch and Mimikyu Shadow Sneak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind Necrozma is a viable mid-game wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, capable of hitting most of the metagame for massive damage after just one setup turn. Offensive Trick Room Necrozma is a notable anti-offense tool that can claim multiple KOs in a game by taking advantage of faster threats being relatively frail and susceptible to being OHKOed by many of its attacks. Weakness Policy similarly takes advantage of Necrozma's natural bulk and typing to boost on Knock Off and U-turn attempts, usually from physically weak Pokemon like Cyclizar and Talonflame that otherwise don't threaten it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Encore and Taunt</strong>: Encore users faster than Necrozma, like Gengar, Jirachi, and Maushold, can put a stop to Calm Mind Necrozma's setup attempts, as well as lock Stealth Rock Necrozma into an uncomfortable move. Similarly, fast Taunt users like Krookodile and Mew can shut down attempts at setting up, recovering health, and establishing entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: While Necrozma has the coverage to threaten most of the other Psychic-types in the tier, like Ground-type attacks for Jirachi and Dark-type attacks for Reuniclus and Slowbro, it still struggles to break through them at times given how bulky they are. Dark Pulse is difficult for Calm Mind Necrozma to fit, as Earth Power is used to handle Jirachi and other Steel-types in one slot, which is usually more valuable. Reuniclus and Slowbro are therefore incredibly good defensive answers to most Necrozma sets, given they can usually take two hits while getting off a Thunder Wave to hinder Necrozma for their teammates or using Calm Mind themselves to set up in a matchup that is favorable for them.</p> <p><strong>Bug-type Pokemon</strong>: Necrozma struggles to keep pace with the offensive Bug-type Pokemon in the metagame, notably flopping as an offensive lead when matching up into Kleavor. Other niche hyper offense leads like Ribombee also pose problems for Necrozma, making the offensive Stealth Rock set difficult to use against opposing offensive teams.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Necrozma is a strong setup sweeper, making use of its excellent movepool to power through traditional answers like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon. Photon Geyser allows Necrozma to break through Unaware Pokemon like Quagsire trying to wall it and completely disregard Mimikyu's Disguise. Earthquake allows it to hit Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi for super effective damage. X-Scissor takes care of Dark- and Psychic-types that would otherwise prove difficult for Necrozma to power through such as Krookodile, Umbreon, and Slowbro. Knock Off hits Psychic-types for super effective damage while doubling as item removal on neutral targets like Hippowdon. With a Lum Berry, Necrozma can set up on Pokemon like Talonflame, Body Slam Jirachi, and Scald Slowbro without fear of getting crippled by status. Alternatively, Necrozma's high natural bulk and ability Prism Armor allows it to take weak super effective attacks like Knock Off and U-turn from physically weak pivots like Cyclizar and Talonflame to safely activate its Weakness Policy and get a huge boost to its Attack. Tera Fairy flips Necrozma's weaknesses to Bug- and Dark-type attacks into resistances, which is useful for breaking through common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Mienshao and Bisharp. Tera Electric gives Necrozma an immunity to Thunder Wave and other forms of paralysis and the ability to set up on Jirachi by resisting Iron Head. Tera Fire gives Necrozma a resistance to Bug-type attacks while also giving it an immunity to burn from attacks like Slowbro's Scald and Entei's Sacred Fire and allows it to freely set up on any Pokemon using Will-O-Wisp like Talonflame.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Necrozma best fits on offense teams as a late-game cleaner once its checks have been worn down. Physical walls such as Hippowdon and Slowbro can be problematic for Necrozma, so powerful wallbreakers like Basculegion-F and Armarouge can open the way for it to clean late-game. Fighting-type partners like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos Wing are great at checking Dark-types like Krookodile and Umbreon that can stop Necrozma from sweeping if not running X-Scissor. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Chesnaught and Jirachi can help +1 Attack Necrozma pick up KOs more easily on Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Krookodile and gives it a potential 2HKO on Slowbro. Even at +1 Speed, Necrozma is outsped by a plethora of Choice Scarf users like Gengar, Krookodile, and Mienshao and is weak to two of the most common priority moves in Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Bisharp's Sucker Punch, making speed control and defensive partners that can switch into Pokemon trying to revenge kill very valuable. On the one hand, speed control options like Thunder Wave Slowbro and Body Slam Jirachi can make up for Necrozma's middling Speed by crippling the aforementioned Choice Scarf users that can stop Necrozma from cleaning. On the other hand, physical tanks such as Hippowdon and Amoonguss and special walls like Empoleon switch into the revenge killers while offering utility like entry hazards and Rocky Helmet chip damage.</p>"

Meteor Beam increases Necrozma's power while also threatening to OHKO Pokemon like Talonflame and Noivern. Earth Power gives Necrozma the coverage to break through Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi. Power Herb doubles as a one-turn solution to Meteor Beam and a way to remove Necrozma's item, weakening Knock Off from Pokemon like Cyclizar, Krookodile, and Galarian Zapdos. This makes Necrozma notable, as it is a Psychic-type that is able to mitigate damage taken by Knock Off. Prism Armor is a great ability, making super effective hits much easier to take as Necrozma establishes entry hazards and racks up damage. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin Cyclizar from removing hazards and weakens Bug-type attacks like U-turn from Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos.</p> <p>Offensive teams use Necrozma as a Stealth Rock lead to capitalize on its unique offensive profile and get an early advantage over balance and bulky offense structures, hitting staples like Cyclizar, Hippowdon, and Jirachi for enough damage to ensure Stealth Rock goes up. Other Stealth Rock leads like Kleavor and Terrakion have limited options and are handled by many balance staples like Chesnaught, Jirachi, and Hippowdon, while Necrozma can run multiple sets and has great coverage, letting it threaten a majority of the metagame, including common defensive staples. Necrozma's ability to immediately output damage and get a boost to Special Attack with Meteor Beam makes would-be checks like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi susceptible to getting taken out by a boosted Earth Power, as well as threatening Assault Vest Cyclizar enough to ensure Stealth Rock set by Necrozma stay up. Teammates that appreciate these bulky Steel-types and specially defensive walls being worn down, like Armarouge and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, all thrive when they're able to set up and clean late-game, especially with Stealth Rock support. Similarly, physical sweepers like Maushold and Gyarados notably appreciate Jirachi being worn down, as they can struggle to beat Jirachi, since it threatens to use Encore to disrupt setup attempts or paralyze with Body Slam.</p>"

On rain teams, Barraskewda turns into an incredibly powerful threat that is practically impossible to outspeed thanks to Swift Swim. However, Barraskewda suffers from the presence of common Water-resistant Regenerator Pokemon like Slowbro and Amoonguss that can shut it down and render its attempts at wallbreaking useless. Barraskewda is also quite frail and can be easily forced out, which can end up giving strong wallbreakers such as Basculegion-F and Hisuian Lilligant more opportunities to blow holes in Barraskewda's team. Thus, Barraskewda often relies on offensive partners to break through its checks and counters and defensive ones to restrict opposing wallbreakers from taking advantage of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Barraskewda may opt for Psychic Fangs as a coverage move instead of Aqua Jet or Crunch to be able to threaten Amoonguss and Chesnaught. Life Orb is an option over Choice Band and Heavy-Duty Boots that takes away Barraskewda's reliance on predictions while still enabling it to deal quite a bit of damage; however, the recoil damage combined with entry hazard and Rocky Helmet chip will wear it down very quickly. Mystic Water is a safer alternative on rain teams that still improves Barraskewda's ability to spam its STAB moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Suicune can easily come in on Barraskewda's STAB moves and proceed to take advantage of it by setting up or firing off a Scald. Thus, their presence on the opposing team can drastically dampen Barraskewda's ability to break walls. In addition, strong Water-types like Basculegion-F and Volcanion can turn Barraskewda into a wallbreaking opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types like Chesnaught and Amoonguss take little damage from Barraskewda's attacks, easily heal up and at the same time deal decent chip damage to it by way of Rocky Helmet, thus decreasing Barraskewda's longevity at a cheap cost. Wo-Chien is able to shrug off most attacks from Barraskewda and its Water-type partners that utilize rain and strike back with Knock Off or Foul Play. Hisuian Lilligant can also take advantage of Barraskewda by using it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users</strong>: The common presence of Choice Scarf users that can outspeed and capitalize on Barraskewda such as Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos hinders its reliability as a fast pivot.

Close Combat is essential coverage to threaten common Water-resistant or -immune targets such as Cyclizar, Wo-Chien, Empoleon, and Volcanion. Aqua Jet enables Barraskewda to pick off fast sweepers such as Weak Armor Armarouge and Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Krookodile after they are weakened. Crunch can serve as optional coverage to threaten some of Barraskewda's checks like Slowbro and Basculegion-F. Choice Band provides Barraskewda with much-needed offensive firepower that allows it to act as a more threatening wallbreaker. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to keep Barraskewda from falling in range of strong priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch, although the loss in power is very noticeable. A Jolly nature allows Barraskewda to outspeed key targets such as Cyclizar and Noivern. An Adamant nature trades off some of its Speed for damage and is preferred on rain teams, as Swift Swim already boosts Barraskewda's Speed to incredible levels. Tera Water boosts the power of Barraskewda's STAB moves, which is often all it needs to clean up a chipped opposition. Tera Fighting is used to power up Close Combat, enabling Barraskewda to deal more damage to Water-immune or -resistant foes like Volcanion and Suicune while also giving it useful resistances to U-turn and Dark-type moves. Tera Dark boosts the power of Crunch, which can allow Barraskewda to pick off Psychic-type Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus after some chip damage and give it resistances to key priority moves like Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu and Sucker Punch from Bisharp.</p> <p>Barraskewda finds itself at home in offense structures that can utilize its Speed and power to create holes that can be taken advantage of by its partners. It pairs well with special wallbreakers like Gengar, Gardevoir, and Armarouge that can capitalize on Flip Turn giving them safe entry points against physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss. On rain teams, Barraskewda synergizes well with other rain exploiters like Basculegion-F and Kingdra to overwhelm Water-resistant foes like Slowbro, Empoleon, and Noivern with brute force. Other pivots can form VoltTurn cores with Barraskewda that aim to accrue chip damage on the opposing team by safely switching in on each other's defensive checks, with strong options like Magnezone, Galarian Zapdos, and Raikou synergizing particularly well thanks to their ability to threaten defensive Water-types like Slowbro and Empoleon. Barraskewda appreciates the presence of defensive partners such as Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Chesnaught that can keep wallbreakers like Basculegion-F, Volcanion, and Hisuian Lilligant from dealing too much damage after forcing Barraskewda out. Choice Band Barraskewda often relies on entry hazard removal options such as Cyclizar and Talonflame to prevent strong priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Choice Band Entei's Extreme Speed from picking it off after some entry hazard chip.</p>"

Overdrive nails Empoleon and hits other Pokemon resistant or immune to Normal, such as Registeel, Jirachi, and Gengar. Boomburst and Overdrive hit through Substitute, which comes in handy against foes like Suicune and Raikou. Sludge Bomb hits Gardevoir for decent damage, which helps if Gardevoir has copied Punk Rock with Trace, and it's also a big hit against Wo-Chien. Snarl is an alternative that hits Golurk and Palossand super effectively, and it still 2HKOes Jirachi and Choice Specs Magnezone after Stealth Rock damage. Volt Switch helps Toxtricity keep up momentum and chip away at switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra until they're weak enough to overwhelm. Tera Normal turns Boomburst's power up to eleven, 2HKOing even Rhyperior, bulky Jirachi, and Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra.

    "overview": "<p>Regidrago's access to Dragon Energy paired with its decent Speed and monstrous HP allows it to be a great sweeper late-game while still having utility as a revenge killer mid-game. Regidrago's ability, Dragon's Maw, is amazing, strengthening its already powerful STAB Dragon Energy even further so that it OHKOes threats like Terrakion, Armarouge, and Basculegion-F. While Regidrago has enormous HP and its typing has many useful resistances, aiding it against Pokemon like Volcanion, Raikou, and Armarouge, it can't put either of them to good use, as it needs to conserve its HP to ensure Dragon Energy stays as strong as possible. Additionally, Regidrago's lack of coverage moves forces it to rely on Terastallization to even hit most Fairy-types for good damage. Regidrago is quite slow for a Choice Scarf user, too, underspeeding the majority of Choice Scarf foes such as Jirachi, Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Gengar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Pulse provides Regidrago with a reliable STAB move that it can use repeatedly, though it is weaker than Draco Meteor and—depending on Regidrago's current HP—Dragon Energy. Regidrago can run Choice Specs instead of Choice Scarf to more easily break through bulkier teams; however, Dragon Energy is typically powerful enough without any further boosts, and Choice Specs leaves Regidrago open to being revenge killed or taking damage much more easily. Regidrago can become a setup sweeper with Loaded Dice and a set of Dragon Dance / Scale Shot / Earthquake / Tera Blast Steel, capitalizing on its gargantuan HP to find multiple turns to set up, but it's quite reliant on Terastallization to get past certain Fairy-types like Air Balloon Klefki.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Regidrago's most powerful moves, Dragon Energy and Draco Meteor, are both entirely useless against Fairy-type Pokemon like Gardevoir, Air Balloon Klefki, and Mimikyu. Additionally, Air Balloon Klefki is immune to Earth Power, forcing Regidrago to either use Tera Blast Steel to hit it or switch out. Not only that, but Mimikyu's Disguise gives it insurance against Regidrago, protecting Mimikyu even if Regidrago goes for a coverage move. However, the majority of them need to watch out for Tera Blast Steel.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Specially defensive Steel-types such as Jirachi, Empoleon, Registeel, and Magnezone cause the most issues for Regidrago, since they can switch in and set up entry hazards in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Priority and Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Due to Dragon Energy's power being heavily dependent on Regidrago's HP, Regidrago hates anything that could make it take damage before it attacks. For this reason, it's highly susceptible to Bisharp's Sucker Punch and especially Mamoswine's Ice Shard as well as common Choice Scarf foes such as Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, Gengar, and Mienshao.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Regidrago is a threatening late-game sweeper, with its powerful Dragon Energy cleanly OHKOing many offensive foes such as Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Feraligatr. However, Dragon Energy can be unreliable at times due to its insistence on Regidrago maintaining high HP. Draco Meteor provides a consistently strong attack regardless of Regidrago's current HP, though it's not as spammable as Dragon Energy due to its Special Attack-dropping effect. Earth Power complements Regidrago's Dragon-type STAB moves nicely, hitting Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, and Empoleon super effectively. Similarly, Tera Blast Steel targets Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Mimikyu, which Regidrago immensely struggles against. Additionally, Tera Steel allows Regidrago to take on Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks in a pinch from Pokemon like Gardevoir, Hisuian Goodra, and Mamoswine.</p> <p>Regidrago thrives on balance and bulky offense structures that can keep it healthy through providing entry hazard control as well as switch-ins to faster threats while being able to chip its checks to open it up for a sweep late-game. Fairy-types like Gardevoir, Klefki, and Mimikyu are Regidrago's biggest roadblock to sweeping teams. Because of this, Regidrago greatly appreciates support from Steel-type partners that can handle them with ease, such as Bisharp, Registeel, Jirachi, and Magnezone. However, when these same Steel-type Pokemon are on the opposing team, they can cause problems for Regidrago. This means Magnezone is an especially good teammate, since it can provide extra support through Magnet Pull, locking in and KOing pesky opposing Steel-types for Regidrago. Additionally, other Pokemon that beat Steel-types like Krookodile, Mienshao, and Volcanion work well alongside Regidrago. What's more, Krookodile can surprise Fairy-types with its Gunk Shot; Mienshao is great at chipping and crippling Fairy-types with its U-turn and Knock Off, respectively; and Volcanion acts as a decent defensive switch-in to Fairy-types for Regidrago. Since Regidrago's chance at a sweep is heavily reliant on its ability to repeatedly throw off a powerful Dragon Energy, hazard control is vital. Defoggers like Talonflame complement Regidrago quite well, being decent switch-ins to Fairy-types like Gardevoir and Mimikyu while not overlapping with its typing unlike other hazard clearers such as Cyclizar and Noivern. In a similar vein, Wish passers and Healing Wish users like Umbreon, Jirachi, and Gardevoir as well as Lunar Dance Cresselia are great at keeping Regidrago healthy. Pivots like Magnezone, Galarian Zapdos, and Talonflame synergize well alongside Regidrago, as they can provide it with safe entry through their pivot moves, simultaneously keeping it healthy and maintaining Dragon Energy's power. On top of that, these three partners can threaten bothersome foes like Gardevoir, Registeel, and Mimikyu, respectively. Another issue with Regidrago is that the majority of Choice Scarf users outspeed Regidrago and, by dealing damage to it, threaten its chance at sweeping with Dragon Energy. This means that answers such as Slowbro and Gastrodon to Choice Scarf foes like Jirachi, Galarian Zapdos, and Krookodile are recommended. Pokemon like Klefki, Empoleon, and Rhyperior make for especially strong partners, as their hazards can wear down the opposing team to the point where Regidrago can sweep it without issue.</p>"

  "Kleavor": {
    "overview": "<p>With a high Attack stat and access to Sharpness and Stone Axe, Kleavor is very consistent in dishing out great damage while setting up Stealth Rock. Moreover, with access to STAB U-turn, Kleavor can opt to run Choice Scarf sets, as it outspeeds common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Basculegion-F and Gardevoir. Kleavor is a great lead for offensive teams, as its main utility in Stone Axe gives it an advantage over other Stealth Rock leads such as Terrakion and Azelf, which Taunt cripples. Kleavor also has Swords Dance, which allows it to not be as passive and one-dimensional as the other leads. U-turn also allows Kleavor to pivot out of defensive switch-ins such as Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Registeel and gain momentum for the team. However, Kleavor is rather frail defensively, and being weak to Stealth Rock hinders its ability to work as a momentum generator. Ultimately, as a lead, Kleavor has a low Speed stat compared to other leads, which makes it being prone to Iron Head from Jirachi and Rock Blast from Terrakion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots + Swords Dance is a good option for pivot Kleavor, as it mitigates the Stealth Rock weakness and makes Kleavor more offensively threatening. Tailwind is an option on lead sets, as Kleavor can set it up before fainting to threaten foes offensively, allowing naturally slow Pokemon such as Armarouge and Feraligatr be more threatening. Covert Cloak is also an option to avoid getting flinched by Iron Head Jirachi, as it is a main form of counterplay versus lead Kleavor hyper offense teams. One could also opt to run Choice Band, which works similar to Choice Scarf, but losing the ability to outspeed Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Basculegion-F, and common faster Pokemon such as Krookodile and Jirachi is unappealing. Tera Bug X-Scissor has a good chance to OHKO Amoonguss and Slowbro and can 2HKO Chesnaught.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Anti-leads</strong>: Jirachi outspeeds Kleavor and threatens to KO or flinch it with Iron Head. Rock Blast Terrakion naturally outspeeds Kleavor and needs three hits to KO Kleavor, and it is a popular anti-Kleavor lead. If Kleavor cannot set up Stealth Rock, it gives the opposing team a huge advantage, as Stealth Rock allows hyper offense teams to break through opposing teams much more easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Jirachi outspeed and threaten to KO Choice Scarf Kleavor after some chip damage, and they pressure lead Kleavor into switching out.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss shrug off hits from non-Swords Dance Kleavor sets and threaten it back with STAB moves such as Earthquake from Hippowdon, Body Press from Chesnaught, and Foul Play from Amoonguss.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Kleavor is weak to Stealth Rock, rendering Choice Scarf sets crippled and unable to pivot as effectively once Stealth Rock is active.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Kleavor is checked by Steel-types such as Registeel and Hisuian Goodra if it is not using Close Combat or is locked into Stone Axe. Bisharp also can set up on non-Close Combat Kleavor and threaten to sweep the team. Bisharp in particular is very threatening against hyper offense teams, as it has a great matchup against the archetype.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swords Dance threatens defensive leads such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon, and STAB X-Scissor will threaten to 2HKO them. This usually ends up with Hippowdon or Gastrodon weakened, which makes it easier for Kleavor's teammates to KO them. Close Combat allows Kleavor to hit Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Registeel. Trailblaze boosts Kleavor's Speed and makes it a threatening sweeper, and it is especially good against offensive teams, as they do not have a solid defensive backbone and often rely on outspeeding and KOing Kleavor. Focus Sash prevents Kleavor from being KOed by faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Basculegion-F and Stone Edge Terrakion. Tera Ghost is used to block Rapid Spin from Cyclizar, though Kleavor should rarely Terastallize due to the value Terastallization brings to its teammates.</p> <p>This is the standard lead Kleavor set on a hyper offense team. Common hyper offense teammates such as Terrakion, Bisharp, and Mimikyu appreciate Kleavor's ability to set up Stealth Rock reliably. These Pokemon will have an easier time sweeping due to Kleavor setting up Stealth Rock and weakening physical walls such as Hippowdon. Other hyper offense staples that are weak to Stealth Rock such as Gyarados and Weakness Policy Armarouge can struggle on teams with lead Kleavor, since Kleavor cannot prevent other leads such as Terrakion and Azelf from setting up Stealth Rock, making Maushold a great teammate due to having entry hazard control in Tidy Up, as well as being a strong setup sweeper.</p>"

Choice Scarf allows Kleavor to outspeed common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Basculegion-F. Other Choice Scarf users able to set up hazards do exist in RU, mainly Krookodile, but it has to decide whether to set up Stealth Rock or attack; Kleavor bypasses that due to having access to Stone Axe. U-turn allows Kleavor to pivot out of bad matchups such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught and gives the team momentum. Close Combat hits Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Registeel. Tera Fighting flips Kleavor's Stealth Rock weakness and lets Close Combat OHKO Empoleon, Krookodile, and Hisuian Goodra.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor fits on bulky offense teams and acts as one of the main momentum generators of the team.

VoltTurn cores with Mienshao, Galarian Zapdos, and Magnezone can take advantage of the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Chesnaught and Talonflame that tend to switch into Kleavor. Having access to entry hazard control is almost mandatory for Kleavor, as its weakness to Stealth Rock cripples its effectiveness.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tera Blast Ghost provides Basculegion physical Ghost-type coverage, but Shadow Ball tends to hit targets like Slowbro hard enough without making Basculegion reliant on exhausting a resource as valuable as Terastallization. A Choice Scarf can remedy Basculegion's mediocre Speed, but Basculegion-F generally outclasses Basculegion as a Choice Scarf user. Psychic Fangs is boosted by Choice Band, nails Amoonguss and Chesnaught, and 3HKOes Volcanion, but Basculegion is most effective as a wallbreaker across matchups when it's using all of its moveslots for its spammable STAB moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Volcanion is a hard wall to Basculegion and prevents it from pivoting, and the threat of burns from Steam Eruption easily forces Basculegion out. Vaporeon and Storm Drain Gastrodon also outright wall Basculegion.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Chesnaught easily sponges Water-type attacks and absorbs Shadow Ball. Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can repeatedly tank Basculegion's powerful Wave Crash. Slowbro can use Regenerator to repeatedly pivot into Basculegion's Water-type attacks while threatening Basculegion with a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Scald users like Slowbro and Suicune can fish for burns against Basculegion. Talonflame is a relevant Flame Body user that might exhaust Terastallization or sacrifice itself to burn Basculegion for its teammates. A burn from Sacred Fire from Entei can also heavily reduce Basculegion's damage output, but does usually mean Entei is being KO'd in return if it does not Terastallize.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Basculegion's tendency to wear itself out with Wave Crash recoil and entry hazard damage opens it up to revenge killers like Galarian Zapdos, Noivern, and Gengar.

    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Basculegion differentiates itself from Basculegion-F with its greater Attack, offering plenty of damage with its powerful STAB Wave Crash and other physical Water-type moves to overpower physical walls like Hippowdon and specially defensive Water-resistant Pokemon like Empoleon and Hisuian Goodra. Flip Turn helps Basculegion keep up momentum, especially against defensive switch-ins like Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Empoleon. Aqua Jet compensates for Basculegion's poor Speed and enables it to pick off faster foes like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Weak Armor-boosted Armarouge. Although Shadow Ball isn't boosted by Choice Band, it's still Basculegion's strongest move against Slowbro and only effective move against Volcanion. Adaptability cranks up Basculegion's power even further, enabling it to potentially 2HKO bulky Hisuian Goodra with Wave Crash and guaranteeing a 2HKO on Slowbro with Shadow Ball. Alternatively, Swift Swim nets Basculegion a spot on rain teams; the boost from Swift Swim compensates for Basculegion's middling Speed, and the rain provides a comparable boost to Adaptability for Basculegion's Water-type moves. Tera Water lets Basculegion's Wave Crash OHKO Cyclizar, while increasing the damage output of Aqua Jet and Flip Turn. Basculegion also enjoys shedding its weaknesses to Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu. The extra damage Tera Ghost provides Shadow Ball helps Adaptability variants of Basculegion finish off Slowbro more quickly, though the trade-off of losing the Adaptability boost for Basculegion's Water-type moves can make it less potent as a revenge killer and offensive pivot.</p> <p>VoltTurn teams appreciate Basculegion as a powerful wallbreaker that functions as an offensive pivot, and it forms great pivot cores with Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Cyclizar, and Raikou. Knock Off users like Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Chesnaught threaten to cap Basculegion's damage output if they don't KO it directly, so Basculegion relies on Knock Off absorbers like Wo-Chien and Amoonguss. If Basculegion joins rain teams, it will be reliant on Politoed to get the rain up. Politoed and other Water-types on rain teams, such as Barraskewda and Kingdra, work with Basculegion to overload checks to Water-types like Slowbro and Suicune. On these rain teams, Kilowattrel can threaten bulky Water-types and Water-immune Pokemon, including Slowbro and Volcanion, for Basculegion. Healing Wish and Lunar Dance users like Jirachi, Gardevoir, and Cresselia give Basculegion a second chance wallbreaking or cleaning up, healing off any burns Basculegion's taken and making up for the massive amount of damage Basculegion tends to accrue from recoil and entry hazards. Basculegion itself appreciates hazards being up to wear down Wo-Chien and non-Heavy Duty Boots variants of Slowbro and Amoonguss, so Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Kleavor can support it. Spikes support from Chesnaught and Klefki goes even further than Stealth Rock for wearing down Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and other checks to Basculegion that forego Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Basculegion-F can also become extremely threatening under rain with Swift Swim or on Sticky Web teams with Weakness Policy. However, Basculegion-F's mediocre Speed means that even Choice Scarf sets can be outsped and threatened by other common Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos, Gengar, and Gardevoir. Furthermore, the ubiquity of specially defensive Pokemon like Umbreon, Empoleon, and Assault Vest Cyclizar often results in Basculegion-F relying on physical wallbreaker teammates like Galarian Zapdos to start making progress.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Basculegion-F is a strong option for speed control thanks to its powerful Adaptability-boosted attacks and good defensive typing. Its bulk and resistances offer it many opportunities to enter the field against common Pokemon like Slowbro, Jirachi, and Registeel. Choice Scarf enables Basculegion-F to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, including Jolly Barraskewda and Talonflame. Ice Beam is important to hit the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist Basculegion-F's STAB attacks like Cyclizar and Bulletproof Chesnaught. Flip Turn allows Basculegion-F to pivot out against special walls like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon while still dealing respectable damage thanks to Adaptability. It is not recommended to Terastallize Basculegion-F, as the damage boost is minimal, and Adaptability will no longer apply to its old typings. For this reason, it uses either Tera Ghost or Water, and it should be Terastallized primarily for the defensive benefits. Tera Ghost means that Basculegion is no longer weak to Electric- and Grass-type attacks from Hisuian Goodra, Armarouge, and Amoonguss, while Tera Water sheds the vulnerability to Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Basculegion-F is most comfortable on bulky offense teams that appreciate its speed control while also making use of its defensive qualities to serve as a pivot. Since it is expected to enter the field multiple times, entry hazard removal options such as Cyclizar and Talonflame are valuable allies, with Cyclizar being able to survive Electric- and Grass-type attacks from Choice-locked Hisuian Goodra and Amoonguss, while Talonflame can tank physical attacks from faster Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos. Basculegion-F can form a VoltTurn core with teammates like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos that want to attack the special walls like Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra that answer Basculegion-F. These Fighting-types can also take Knock Off from Pokemon like Krookodile while threatening the Dark- and Dragon-types that can switch into Basculegion-F such as Umbreon, Hisuian Goodra, and Cyclizar. As Basculegion-F often needs help breaking through bulky Water- and Grass-types like Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien, other special attackers like Armarouge and Hisuian Goodra have the power and coverage to create holes in the opposing team for Basculegion-F to exploit. Hazards set by Pokemon such as Krookodile, Chesnaught, and Jirachi can weaken checks into KO range of Basculegion-F's attacks and rack up extended damage as it forces switches and pivots out.</p>"

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>Agility Basculegion-F is a potent special wallbreaker with an excellent and near-unresisted STAB combination for the tier. Ice Beam allows it to break through Dragon-types like Cyclizar and Noivern and Grass-types like Amoonguss and Chesnaught. Weakness Policy sets are particularly strong against a weak Knock Off from utility Pokemon like Cyclizar, Empoleon, and Chesnaught. On the other hand, Life Orb is a more reliable but less powerful option for powering up Basculegion-F's attacks. Its natural bulk along with this EV spread allows it to survive several key benchmark hits. 52 Defense EVs ensure Basculegion can comfortably survive a Sucker Punch from max Attack Bisharp from full health. Choice Scarf Gengar outspeeds Basculegion-F even after one Agility boost, but with 24 Special Defense EVs, Basculegion-F is guaranteed to take one Shadow Ball from Gengar from full health and fire back with its own Shadow Ball or use Agility a second time. 196 Speed EVs allow unboosted Basculegion-F to outspeed Bisharp and Timid Magnezone. Adaptability makes Basculegion-F a subpar user of Terastallization, as the additional power boost from either Tera Ghost or Water is minimal and comes at the expense of losing its Adaptability boost on its other STAB type. However, Basculegion-F can utilize either Tera Ghost or Water in a pinch to squeeze out some extra damage or remove one of its weaknesses against foes such as Magnezone or Krookodile.</p> <p>Agility Basculegion fits well on offensive structures in search of a powerful special attacker and potential mid- to late-game sweeper. It appreciates rain support from Politoed to boost the power of its Water-type moves. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Terrakion, Krookodile, and Chesnaught enable Basculegion-F's ability to clean late-game as well. Chesnaught is an excellent partner for Basculegion-F on Spikes-stacking teams, as Chesnaught can tank the Dark- and Electric-type moves that threaten the fish while enjoying Basculegion-F's natural immunity to Rapid Spin from Cyclizar. Weakness Policy Basculegion-F sets can subsequently take advantage of Cyclizar by baiting a careless Knock Off and setting up with Agility or firing back with a boosted Ice Beam. Basculegion-F's ability to deny hazard removal from Cyclizar makes it an excellent addition to Sticky Web teams as well. Specially defensive Pokemon like Empoleon, Wo-Chien, and Hisuian Goodra are problematic for Basculegion-F, as they can comfortably stomach any of its unboosted attacks. Therefore, powerful Fighting-type wallbreakers like Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos pair well with Basculegion-F in helping to eliminate these threatening foes. Basculegion-F in turn aids these Fighting-type wallbreakers by threatening their defensive answers like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Basculegion-F is notably vulnerable to paralysis from status spreaders like Amoonguss and Jirachi, since the speed drop from paralysis neuters its ability to set up and sweep teams. Therefore, partners that can absorb paralysis like Magnezone can be helpful teammates. If Basculegion-F is unable to use Agility, then Choice Scarf Gardevoir can take advantage of it due to Trace copying Adaptability. As a result, Steel-type stalwarts like Jirachi and Registeel are helpful in keeping Gardevoir at bay. Basculegion-F is also appreciative of teammates like Galarian Zapdos, Hippowdon, and Talonflame that can deal with strong priority users like Sucker Punch Bisharp and Shadow Sneak Mimikyu. Basculegion-F should be paired with allies like Hisuian Goodra, Bisharp, and Krookodile that can manage revenge killers that outspeed and KO a weakened Basculegion-F after one Agility, such as Choice Scarf Gengar and opposing Bisharp.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs Basculegion-F is an incredibly powerful wallbreaker that can use the threat of forcing out common Pokemon like Slowbro, Jirachi, and Hippowdon to its advantage. Hydro Pump trades accuracy for power, notably allowing Basculegion-F to OHKO Magnezone. Ice Beam is important coverage for threatening Dragon- and Grass-types like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Wo-Chien. Flip Turn is useful for pivoting out of special walls like Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon into Pokemon that can exploit them like Galarian Zapdos. Adaptability boosts Basculegion-F's power to immense heights, while Swift Swim can be used under rain to turn Basculegion-F into a frightening sweeper with few switch-ins. While Adaptability means Basculegion-F rarely wants to use Terastallization, it can occasionally be used to secure KOs on crucial foes; for example, Tera Ghost guarantees a 2HKO on Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra. Tera Water can be particularly useful for Swift Swim Basculegion, as when paired with rain, it boosts its Water-type attacks enough to even guarantee a 2HKO on Assault Vest Cyclizar after Stealth Rock without needing to click Ice Beam.</p> <p>Choice Specs Basculegion-F fits well on balance and bulky offense structures, as well as niche but threatening rain teams, that are in search of a special wallbreaker that can almost always force progress with incredibly powerful attacks. Pivot partners such as Galarian Zapdos, Noivern, and Magnezone can form powerful VoltTurn cores with Basculegion-F that can make progress by luring in relatively passive Pokemon that it can exploit, such as Hippowdon and Jirachi, or wearing down shared checks, like Gastrodon and Hisuian Goodra. In particular, Fighting-type pivots like the aforementioned Galarian Zapdos are beneficial for Basculegion-F, as they can check Dark-types like Krookodile, Bisharp, and Umbreon that threaten it and absorb Knock Off from Pokemon like Cyclizar. On rain teams, wallbreaker teammates like Barraskewda and Kilowattrel can similarly pivot around with Basculegion-F while wearing down or eliminating its checks like Umbreon and Empoleon. Entry hazard support from partners like Krookodile and Chesnaught can help further in chipping away at the opposing team. In offensive structures, setup sweepers and cleaners such as Armarouge, Gyarados, and Choice Scarf Krookodile particularly appreciate Basculegion-F's ability to blow holes in the opposing team that they can use to pull off a sweep. Defensive partners such as Hippowdon, Umbreon, and Jirachi are essential partners for Basculegion-F in bulkier structures to mitigate its weakness to faster wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos, Gengar, and Gardevoir. Basculegion-F also appreciates partners like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame that can help it enter the field more safely via hazard removal and pivoting.</p>"

Rain teams appreciate Overqwil’s ability to break through common rain answers like Vaporeon, Volcanion, and Hisuian Goodra. They also appreciate Overqwil being able to wear down other weather setters such as Hippowdon. Overqwil also resists common priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, which would otherwise be threatening to rain teams. Swift Swim sweepers like Barraskewda appreciate their checks in Volcanion and Chesnaught being worn down by Overqwil. Overqwil mandates partners like Politoed to set up rain for its Swift Swim, and it appreciates Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, Close Combat Barraskewda, Volcanion, and Fighting types like Galarian Zapdos to pressure Steel-type foes such as Registeel, Empoleon, and Bisharp, which check unboosted Overqwil. Overqwil appreciates pivot support from Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Barraskewda, and Jirachi to get on the field safely. Overqwil and its partners are vulnerable to being revenged killed by Gardevoir, so special tanks such as Jirachi and Empoleon are appreciated.</p>"

  "Armarouge": {
    "overview": "<p>The incredible power of Armor Cannon makes Armarouge a terrifying foe in the RU tier, often threatening a KO whenever it enters the field. With its excellent STAB combination that hits most of the metagame, Weak Armor that constantly deters weak physical moves like U-turn and Rapid Spin, and the physical bulk to make use of it, Armarouge can serve as both a wallbreaker and sweeper simultaneously. Armarouge is unique among the Psychic-types in the tier due to its ability to threaten Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, and Registeel with Armor Cannon. Armarouge's drawbacks, however, are evident; its Speed is lower than much of the tier, allowing many Pokemon like Basculegion-F, Gengar, and Gyarados to outspeed it prior to Weak Armor's activation, and its ability to take special attacks is poor. Its weakness to Stealth Rock and the combined Defense drops from both Weak Armor and Armor Cannon can cause damage to add up quickly, resulting in Armarouge being unable to survive subsequent attacks from revenge killers and bulky Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meteor Beam, alongside a Power Herb, can compress setup with a coverage option to hit Fire-types like Volcanion and opposing Armarouge into a single moveslot, with the drawback that this combination effectively limits Armarouge to three moveslots for the remainder of the game. Armarouge can effectively use Choice Specs for immediate power that can OHKO Cyclizar with Psyshock after Stealth Rock and 2HKO specially defensive Empoleon with Armor Cannon; it additionally allows Armarouge to use Trick to cripple the few walls that are able to switch into its attacks. Flash Fire can be used with Choice Specs, enabling absolutely nuclear Armor Cannons if positioned correctly, but using Flash Fire means that Gardevoir can Trace it to become immune, and Speed will remain an issue without Weak Armor. Iron Defense can offset the penalty of Weak Armor and give Armarouge the additional bulk to set up Calm Minds or activate Weakness Policy from powerful attacks like Crawdaunt's and Krookodile's Knock Off, all while further boosting Stored Power. Focus Blast can be used to hit opposing special walls like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon, but dropping Energy Ball leaves Armarouge weaker against Water-types like Slowbro. Destiny Bond allows Armarouge to get a surprise KO on a Pokemon that is bulky enough to survive its hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey, Umbreon, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra are all able to comfortably survive Armarouge's attacks and either heal off the damage or deal huge damage in return. With boosts from Calm Mind or Weakness Policy, Armarouge can use Psyshock to answer Chansey, particularly if its Eviolite has been removed, but the last three Pokemon either resist or are immune to Psyshock, meaning Armarouge has to brute force its way through their high Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers like Azelf, Noivern, and Volcanion not only target Armarouge's weaker Special Defense but fail to activate Weak Armor, meaning that Armarouge does not gain the crucial Speed advantage on the next turn. Even attacks from weaker Pokemon like Draco Meteor Cyclizar pose a threat.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Armarouge's use of Weak Armor and Armor Cannon leaves it vulnerable to the many forms of physical priority moves in the tier, such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from Barraskewda and Crawdaunt. Endure sets are safe from First Impression, but unless Armarouge is used in Psychic Terrain, other priority users like Bisharp and Entei are extremely effective at revenge killing it.</p>",

      "Calm Mind + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Armarouge is a devastating special attacker, capable of breaking holes in teams or taking advantage of opposing physical attackers to boost its Speed with Weak Armor in order to sweep. Armarouge particularly excels against Cyclizar, the most common form of entry hazard removal in the tier, due to the minimal damage received and the fact that most of Cyclizar's moves will activate Weak Armor. Psyshock targets the weaker Defense of opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest Cyclizar. Energy Ball is used to hit Water-types with high Defense like Slowbro and Suicune. Tera Fairy provides a valuable resistance to Bisharp's Sucker Punch, as well as allowing Armarouge to shrug off Knock Off from Krookodile, Mienshao, and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Fairy also grants an immunity to Cyclizar's Dragon Tail, preventing Armarouge from being phazed out. Tera Grass grants resistances to Barraskewda's and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, Empoleon's Surf, and Krookodile's Earthquake. This also boosts the damage of Energy Ball, allowing Armarouge to threaten OHKOs on Krookodile, Terrakion, and Hippowdon.</p> <p>Calm Mind Armarouge is most comfortable on balance and offense teams, where it can use its wallbreaking ability to open up holes for its team to exploit or threaten a late-game sweep. Pivot support from VoltTurn users such as Cyclizar, Magnezone, and Jirachi are important to get Armarouge into favorable matchups against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss while preserving its HP. These Pokemon can also bait out weak Knock Off from Cyclizar and Reuniclus, easily allowing Weak Armor to activate. Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos invite physical walls like Hippowdown and Slowbro in, which Armarouge can take advantage of. Opposing special attackers like Gengar, Choice Scarf Basculegion-F, and Noivern outspeed and threaten Armarouge, so allies like Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi, respectively, can switch into their attacks for it. Priority moves are one of the most reliable answers to Armarouge after Weak Armor activates, so pairing it with Psychic Surge Indeedee can nullify this weakness with the added benefit of empowering its Psychic-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "Endure + Weakness Policy": {
        "description": "<p>Weakness Policy Armarouge is a naturally potent wallbreaker and sweeper that can immediately chunk holes in the opposing team thanks to its excellent STAB combination and decent bulk. Armarouge can use the combination of Endure and Weakness Policy to flip situations around at the drop of a hat and threaten a devastating sweep. Armor Cannon is the centerpiece of Armarouge's arsenal as a wallbreaker due to its high Base Power and its drawbacks made negligible by having Endure as an option. Psyshock is consistently powerful and can deal with specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Cyclizar. Stored Power can deal incredible amounts of damage after a Weakness Policy and Weak Armor activation, with the drawback of initially being very weak. Expanding Force is an option on Psychic Terrain teams that can OHKO most non-resistant foes in the tier while Psychic Terrain is active and is still a decently powerful attack otherwise. Energy Ball provides Armarouge with coverage that is essential for dealing with Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune. Calm Mind is an optional setup move that allows Armarouge to capitalize on Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to it, like Cyclizar, Registeel, and Gardevoir, and keeps it from being dependent on Weakness Policy for strengthening its attacks. Weak Armor allows Armarouge to outspeed a massive portion of the tier after surviving a physical attack, thus enabling it to act as an excellent late-game cleaner. A Timid nature ensures that Armarouge outspeeds even the fastest Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Terrakion and Gengar, at +2 Speed. Tera Normal can be used to turn the tables on a Ghost-type revenge killer like Gengar or Mimikyu. Tera Psychic boosts the damage of Armarouge's strong Psychic-type attacks even further and is particularly useful in Psychic Terrain. Tera Ground makes Armarouge immune to Sandstorm damage and also lets it deny Thunder Wave and Electric-type moves from Pokemon such as Magnezone and Reuniclus, which gives it time to either setup further or pick up a KO.</p> <p>Weakness Policy Armarouge fits well on hyper offense and offensive structures that appreciate a safety net that can revenge kill a Choice item user such as Galarian Zapdos or Krookodile if needed and possibly sweep in return. Armarouge can also cover the role of a wallbreaker and cleaner on balance structures that aim to gradually chip away at the opposing team due to its innate firepower and ability to quickly boost its Speed. Armarouge synergizes particularly well with Psychic Terrain and thus partners well with lead Psychic Surge Indeedee; not only does Psychic Terrain power up Armarouge's Psychic-type STAB attacks to unstoppable levels, it also stops Armarouge from being revenge killed with a priority move, which is often its biggest worry after a successful Endure. Armarouge often finds its itself lacking meaningful ways to deal with specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Hisuian Goodra and therefore benefits from strong physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Terrakion and Bisharp as well as wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos, as they can help to remove or deal large chunks of damage to Armarouge's checks. Armarouge benefits from hazard removal options such as Tidy Up Maushold and Rapid Spin Cyclizar, as they can prevent it from losing its health to entry hazard chip, thus keeping it from being dependent on Endure for surviving attacks. Armarouge works well with fast pivots such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and Cyclizar that can bait a Knock Off from weak physical attackers such as Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Chesnaught and use it against them to threaten a devastating sweep by activating Weakness Policy.</p>"

Bellibolt's moveset is very flexible, letting it aid its team in a variety of ways. Unlike other walls, Bellibolt can cripple switch-ins with Static, keep up momentum with Volt Switch, simultaneously damage opponents while healing with Parabolic Charge, and force out Pokemon that would usually beat it such as Ground-types like Hippowdon with Muddy Water. Static is a great ability on Bellibolt to punish physical attackers and the many U-turns in the tier. Bellibolt's main issue is that it struggles against bulky Steel-types such as Magnezone and Hisuian Goodra, as they can easily tank its hits and make progress against it. Despite it having options against them, Ground-types are also a pain for Bellibolt, as if they can get in against it, they can do large damage with Earthquake and threaten it out. Bellibolt can also be overwhelmed by strong neutral attacks such as Galarian Zapdos's Close Combat and Bisharp's Throat Chop, as its typing doesn't give it many resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tera Blast Fairy can be used in order to hit Dragon-types such as Cyclizar and Flygon that don't care about its attacking moves.

Chilling Water is an option in order to reduce the damage from opposing physical attackers attack stat while still hitting Ground-types, though it is very weak and can give a Defiant boost to either Bisharp or Galarian Zapdos if they switch in correctly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Assault Vest Magnezone, Registeel, and Hisuian Goodra can easily take Bellibolt's hits, not worrying about Toxic and making progress through Knock Off, Stealth Rock, or pivoting.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Although Ground-types such as Krookodile, Flygon, and Golurk cannot switch into Toxic or Muddy Water, they can switch into Bellibolt's STAB options and threaten it out with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Cyclizar</strong>: Cyclizar can easily take Bellibolt's hits, including Toxic, and use it to make progress.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Volt Switch can do solid damage to foes while pivoting Bellibolt out, whereas Parabolic Charge can help Bellibolt stay healthy, especially in combination with Electromorphosis to boost its power. Muddy Water can hit the Ground-types that can switch into its Electric-type moves such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior. Soak allows Bellibolt to threaten switch-ins with massive damage from its Electric-type moves, allow it to badly poison Steel- and Poison-types that would usually be immune to it such as Hisuian Goodra and Amoonguss, and reduce the damage of STAB attacks such as Earthquake from Krookodile and Sacred Fire from Entei. Toxic allows Bellibolt to threaten specially defensive switch-ins such as Umbreon and Wo-Chien that would otherwise not care too much about its attacks. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Bellibolt to ignore entry hazards to take on threats more easily. Rocky Helmet allows Bellibolt to accrue chip damage against the many U-turn users in the tier such as Talonflame, Jirachi, and Galarian Zapdos. Static can punish contact attempts from physical attackers such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao by inflicting them with paralysis. Electromorphosis can turn Bellibolt into quite a dangerous attacker that can deal impressive damage to opponents with its Electric-type moves. It pairs especially well with Parabolic Charge, as it can not only deal more damage, but also increase the amount of HP Bellibolt recovers. 20 Speed EVs allow Bellibolt to outspeed Hippowdon, allowing it to use Toxic, Muddy Water, or Slack Off before it attacks. Tera Water boosts the power of Bellibolt's Muddy Water while removing its weakness to Ground and giving it a solid defensive typing. Tera Fairy gives Bellibolt a Fighting resistance to help take on Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao and can help it take on Ground-types such as Krookodile and Flygon.</p> <p>Bellibolt fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, where it can act as a reliable defensive piece, taking on Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Gyarados that these teams might struggle against. Ground-immune and -resistant partners such as Wo-Chien, Noivern, and Chesnaught can take on the Ground-types such as Krookodile and Rhyperior that threaten Bellibolt out as well as Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Terrakion, while Bellibolt can take on the Flying-types such as Galarian Zapdos and Gyarados. U-turn users such as Mienshao and Jirachi can pair well with Bellibolt to form VoltTurn cores, allowing them to wear down combined checks, such as bulky Ground-types for Mienshao and Steel-types for Jirachi, so that they can be finished off at low health. Water-, Fighting-, and Fire-type wallbreakers pair well with Bellibolt, as it can threaten out the bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Slowbro that wall them. In return, Water-type wallbreakers such as Barraskewda and Feraligatr beat Ground-types like Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Krookodile; Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Gallade and Galarian Zapdos beat Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Magnezone; and Fire-type wallbreakers such as Entei and Armarouge beat Grass- and Steel-types such as Amoonguss and Jirachi. Entry hazard control options such as Cyclizar and Talonflame pair well with Bellibolt as they can remove entry hazards that might otherwise heavily chip Bellibolt and allow Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Choice Band Entei to 2HKO Bellibolt.</p>"

Kilowattrel's STAB moves are also incredibly valuable, as they can hit Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos and Slowbro for super effective damage. The main issue with Kilowattrel is that it can struggle against bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and especially Rhyperior. It also struggles with faster common Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Gardevoir, which can Trace Volt Absorb to block Volt Switch attempts as well. Kilowattrel can be incredibly frail even against resisted attacks such as Galarian Zapdos's Close Combat, and its power is lacking against bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra.

Air slash is a more reliable Flying-type STAB option on Kilowattrel, but it is much weaker and usually not worth it, as it doesn't reliably 2HKO both Mamoswine and Krookodile. Choice Specs can be used to make up for Kilowattrel's only okay damage output, but being affected by Stealth Rock heavily decreases its longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, specially defensive Gastrodon, and especially Rhyperior can wall Kilowattrel pretty easily, as they can block its Volt Switch while not minding Hurricane from it. They can threaten it back with powerful attacks or set up Stealth Rock against it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Magnezone, Raikou, and Bellibolt can easily take Kilowattrel's STAB options and hit it back for decent damage. While it can switch into their Electric-type moves, it has to immediately switch out, as they can threaten it with other moves such as Flash Cannon, Scald, and Toxic, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers and Priority</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Terrakion heavily threaten Kilowattrel, as they can outspeed it and hit it for large damage. Additionally, faster wallbreakers and priority users such as Barraskewda, Bisharp, and especially Mamoswine can outspeed Kilowattrel and threaten it for large damage.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thunder can be used on Kilowattrel on rain teams to allow it to hit even harder. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to not only do solid damage but also pivot out against common switch-ins like Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra. U-turn allows Kilowattrel to pivot out while not being blocked by Ground-types, which works especially well with Spikes support. Weather Ball can also be used on rain teams to allow Kilowattrel to hit the Ground-types that usually wall it such as Rhyperior. Roost allows Kilowattrel to heal off chip damage it sustains over the course of a battle. Volt Absorb allows Kilowattrel to switch into other Electric-types such as Magnezone and Raikou and heal itself from them, while Competitive allows it to punish Defog from Talonflame and Noivern while also benefitting from Intimidate from foes like Krookodile, allowing it to 2HKO Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Raikou that it would otherwise struggle with. Tera Flying allows Hurricane to 2HKO Cyclizar, while Tera Water allows Kilowattrel to take Ice-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Alolan Ninetales and boosts the power of Weather Ball in rain.</p> <p>Kilowattrel fits best on offense and bulky offense, able to leverage its good typing and Speed in order to pivot in and out of battles and take on Ground- and Fighting- types such as Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos. U-turn users such as Galarian Zapdos and Jirachi can form VoltTurn cores with Kilowattrel to chip defensive cores. Galarian Zapdos can easily switch in on the bulky Ground-types that trouble Kilowattrel, while Jirachi can set Stealth Rock and paralyze foes with Body Slam to allow Kilowattrel to sweep easier. Entry hazard setters such as Krookodile and Chesnaught can pair very well with Kilowattrel, as not only can it make use of entry hazard chip damage to break through its checks easier, such as 2HKOing Cyclizar with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, but with Competitive, it can also punish Defog from Pokemon such as Talonflame and Noivern. Fire-type wallbreakers such as Entei and Armarouge pair well with Kilowattrel, as they can lure in and chip Rhyperior with Tera Blast Grass and Energy Ball, respectively, while also taking on Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra, and in return, Kilowattrel can punish bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Volcanion. Rain partners such as Politoed and Barraskewda pair well with Kilowattrel, as Politoed allows it to boost its Thunder and Weather Ball, while Barraskewda forms a nice VoltTurn core with it to pressure defensive switch-ins.</p>"

  "Cyclizar": {
    "overview": "<p>Cyclizar rides in as one of the defining Pokemon of the RU metagame. Its excellent Speed tier, access to Rapid Spin, and ability Regenerator make it the premier entry hazard removal option. It can also break out its utility toolbox, threatening to remove items from common switch-ins like Jirachi and Slowbro with Knock Off; phaze setup Pokemon like Suicune, Cresselia, and Armarouge with Dragon Tail; or pivot into a teammate like Crawdaunt or Entei with U-turn to keep up momentum. U-turn can allow setup sweepers like Armarouge and Reuniclus to freely switch in and start stacking up boosts. Cyclizar is often paired with other Regenerator Pokemon like Slowbro and Amoonguss to form Regenerator cores that can be difficult to break, especially when Cyclizar is removing entry hazards. It can further offer teams a bulky pivot when it straps on the Assault Vest, allowing it to take hits from special wallbreakers like Armarouge, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion. Cyclizar needs to be careful, however, of Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao that are looking to jam up Cyclizar's wheels and OHKO it with STAB Close Combat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam is an option as Cyclizar's STAB move so it can fish for paralysis instead of doing more damage with Draco Meteor or Double-Edge. On teams that may have a hard time dealing with Gastrodon and Swampert, Cyclizar can run Power Whip to threaten a 2HKO on both of them. Overheat is an option for Cyclizars looking to supercharge its matchup against Forretress and Bisharp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Priority</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Krookodile and Terrakion can switch in and threaten to OHKO Cyclizar with Close Combat or take advantage of its need to switch out by using Knock Off or U-turn for free progress. Gardevoir is another common Choice Scarf user that can severely hamper Cyclizar's utility role with Trick. Bisharp can OHKO it at +2 with Sucker Punch, and Mamoswine threatens to KO with Ice Shard if Cyclizar has taken some chip.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types block Rapid Spin and prevent Cyclizar from doing its most impartant job. Palossand isn't very threatened by Knock Off and can completely roadblock Cyclizar's efforts to remove hazards while setting its own up. Mimikyu is a Ghost-type that isn't weak to Knock Off and is immune to Draco Meteor, meaning it can set up Swords Dance for free while Cyclizar is forced to escape. Basculegion-F is a particular nuisance, as it can spinblock Cyclizar while also taking advantage of Knock Off with its Weakness Policy set. Tera Ghost on hazard setters such as Chesnaught, Empoleon, and Hippowdon can also put Cyclizar in a bind, denying it Rapid Spin removal.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Most setup Pokemon, like Bisharp, Terrakion, and Slowbro, can take advantage of Cyclizar's relative weakness and lack of status to set up in front of it, as long as it isn't running Taunt or Dragon Tail.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Cyclizar can safely switch into most special attackers and provide opportunities for its teammates to enter the game thanks to U-turn. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards while also granting Cyclizar a boost to Speed, which helps it outspeed most Choice Scarf users in the tier like Gardevoir and Gengar. It also gives even a paralyzed Cyclizar the opportunity to pivot out of slower opponents like Empoleon and Hippowdon. Knock Off can hit the tier's Pyschic-types such as Reuniclus and Slowbro for decent damage while also threatening the frail Ghost-types like Gengar and Basculegion-F lacking Weakness Policy. Draco Meteor can be used to hit physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Dragon Tail is great at forcing opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Slowbro out. Facade can take advantage of status like burn or paralysis that Cyclizar may be inflicted by throughout the course of a game from opposing Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Jirachi. Assault Vest helps with its otherwise low natural bulk, which is also helped significantly by Regenerator recovery. Timid maximum Speed Cyclizar is faster than the majority of the tier, and the bulk provided allows it to take Ice Beam or Sludge Wave twice from threats such as Basculegion-F and Gengar, respectively. Tera Fairy flips Cyclizar's weakness to Dragon-type moves into an immunity and gives a resistance to Fighting-type moves, helping against opposing Cyclizar, Noivern, and Mienshao. Tera Steel makes Cyclizar resistant to Fairy- and Ice-type moves from the likes of Gardevoir and Empoleon, respectively. Tera Ghost makes it immune to Normal-type, allowing it to stop Rapid Spin attempts from opposing Cyclizar, while adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks as well.</p> <p>Assault Vest Cyclizar can reliably slot onto balance or bulky offense teams as the main form of entry hazard removal while also providing item removal and pivoting. It can also be used on stall teams, though these structures often want another hazard removal option such as Defog Talonflame to reliably maintain hazard control. Cyclizar pairs well with other Regenerator Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Mienshao, and Slowbro, creating teams that are very difficult to break offensively and can provide pressure through status, hazard chip, and gradual damage. Strong offensive teammates like Crawdaunt, Mamoswine, and Volcanion appreciate Cyclizar giving them free entry points. While Cyclizar can often keep hazards off the field, it is advised to still run hazard-resilient or Heavy-Duty Boots teammates, such as Amoonguss, Hisuian Goodra, and Mienshao, since Cyclizar may struggle against teams with Ghost-types like Palossand or Mimikyu. Assault Vest Cyclizar can struggle to retain HP against hazard-stacking archetypes, being unable to remove hazards against teams utilizing Tera Ghost on their hazard setters. To mitigate this dynamic, Cyclizar relies on pivoting into teammates who can apply offensive pressure to deny hazards from being established, like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Volcanion.</p>"
      },
      "Heavy-Duty Boots": {
        "description": "<p>While usually overshadowed by the more prevalent Assault Vest set, running Heavy-Duty Boots on Cyclizar can offer meaningful benefits, allowing access to utility moves, while also making Regenerator more beneficial without needing to worry about the passive chip that comes with its usage as a spinner. Cyclizar is a master at providing utility for a team, boasting Knock Off to remove items from foes for other members of a team to take advantage of, with Heavy-Duty Boots users like Umbreon or Slowbro being great examples of Knock Off's usefulness over the course of a game. U-turn provides a way for Cyclizar to get out of sketchy matchups, being able to use the move safely against most of the tier with its phenomenal Speed stat. Taunt can shut down recovery or setup from foes that believe they can take advantage of the presumed passivity of Cyclizar, such as Hippowdon and Bisharp. Double-Edge can be slotted over Taunt if more damage is desired from Cyclizar, providing a harder-hitting STAB move than Rapid Spin, and its recoil is also somewhat negated with the HP gained back from Regenerator. Tera Ghost provides a last ditch-effort of escape against Fighting-types, one of Cyclizar's sketchier matchups, which is especially prevalent with the large amount of Fighting-type moves present in the tier, like Close Combat from various abusers including Mienshao and Zapdos-Galar; however, Cyclizar is generally the last thing you want to Terastalize unless in truly dire straits, as Terastallization is usually far more effective and useful on other members of a team. Tera Ghost can also deny opposing spinners from removing entry hazards, keeping pressure on opposing teams throughout a game and additionally providing momentum through a wasted Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Cyclizar fits on almost all team structures, with the main exception being hyper offense, as its role as a spinner with access to Regenerator makes it extremely reliable at removing entry hazards throughout the course of a game. To get the best use out of Cyclizar's utility, pairing it up with a Stealth Rock setter is extremely important, as Cyclizar's Knock Off makes opposing teams weaker to hazards; this can either be with allies like Hippowdon, or it can be run with Palossand on teams dedicated to hazard stacking. Additionally, pairing Cyclizar up with offensive options that can take advantage of the momentum that U-turn provides, with notable wallbreakers including Choice Band Terrakion and Volcanion being perfect teammates. Cyclizar is somewhat frail by itself, so pairing it up with defensive presences like the aforementioned physically defensive Stealth Rock setters, along with more specially defensive options like Empoleon, creates strong defensive cores that can be difficult to break and can wear down teams through a war of attrition. These defensive cores can be furthered with Regenerator cores, constantly keeping teammates healthy throughout a match, with notable teammates being Amoonguss, Slowbro, Mienshao, and Reuniclus. Pairing Cyclizar up with multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users is also wise, as it can have problems against dedicated spinblockers, with Palossand on hazard-stacking teams and Mimikyu on hyper offense builds.</p>"

  "Wo-Chien": {
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Wo-Chien leverages its massive bulk, ability, and utility movepool to serve as an effective wall and disruptor by removing items from and chipping away at the opposing team. Foul Play gives Wo-Chien a means of punishing physical setup sweepers like Maushold and Bisharp, which attempt to exploit its relative passivity. Ruination pressures Wo-Chien's defensive answers like Chesnaught and is generally a useful progress maker against Pokemon lacking reliable recovery like Hisuian Goodra and Suicune. Leech Seed serves as Wo-Chien's secondary source of recovery and pairs nicely with Ruination, allowing Wo-Chien to wear down foes over the course of the match regardless of their Defense. Protect gives Wo-Chien an additional turn to recover health and scout moves from Choice item users like Galarian Zapdos, Gardevoir, and Gengar. Leftovers is essential for maximizing Wo-Chien's longevity and make up for its lack of recovery moves. While its defensive EVs are fairly customizable depending on the needs of the team, the Special Defense investment makes Wo-Chien a particularly strong answer to Calm Mind users like Slowbro, Suicune, and Necrozma. Tera Poison patches up Wo-Chien's Fighting-, Fairy- and Bug-type weaknesses while denying poison from Pokemon like Amoonguss and Umbreon, which would otherwise threaten Wo-Chien's longevity. Tera Ghost similarly removes Wo-Chien's weaknesses to Bug- and Fighting-type moves but instead allows it to spinblock against Cyclizar and more effectively answer Maushold, Armarouge, and Ribombee.</p> <p>Wo-Chien fits nicely on balance teams that enjoy its ability to sponge hits while making progress with Knock Off and Leech Seed. Hazard-stacking teams particularly enjoy Wo-Chien's ability to remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from opposing Pokemon, thus maximizing damage output from entry hazards over time. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Gligar, and Gastrodon pair nicely with Wo-Chien. In addition, entry hazards cause Regenerator Pokemon like Slowbro and Cyclizar to take more damage than what they recover with every switch, preventing them from stalling out Wo-Chien. Because of its weakness to Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-type moves, Wo-Chien appreciates teammates that complement its defensive profile like Registeel, Talonflame and Slowbro. Physically defensive teammates like Rocky Helmet Hippowdon and Bellibolt are also useful partners, as they can switch in on and punish U-turns and Knock Offs directed at Wo-Chien. Status moves are especially troublesome for Wo-Chien, as they threaten its ability to sit in on other Pokemon and recover health throughout the battle, so Pokemon that are immune to or don't mind status conditions like Magnezone can be helpful as teammates. Pokemon that can spread burn like Will-O-Wisp Talonflame, Scald Slowbro, and Steam Eruption Volcanion are beneficial for Wo-Chien too, allowing it to more comfortably endure physical attacks and retaliate with Foul Play. Wo-Chien benefits greatly from entry hazard removal, as it will likely be switched in and out throughout the course of the battle. Therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame make for nice partners. Cyclizar is a particularly good partner on hazard-stacking teams, since Rapid Spin does not clear entry hazards on the opponent's side, thus improving Wo-Chien's ability to chip down the opposing team through Knock Off and Leech Seed. Wo-Chien often lures in Poison- and Fighting-types that can be exploited by Future Sight users like Slowbro and Reuniclus. Because of its relative passivity, Wo-Chien can easily get overwhelmed by opposing wallbreakers and setup sweepers, especially if it's unable to Terastallize. As such, potent revenge killers and priority users like Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir and Extreme Speed Entei are appreciated as well.</p>"
