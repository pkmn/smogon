  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its great coverage and natural power augmented by Sheer Force and Life Orb, Gengar is one of the better wallbreakers in Almost Any Ability, and one that is not dead weight against more offensive teams thanks to its great Speed tier. Gengar also has access to a great support movepool including moves such as Taunt and Mean Look, which help it do its job as a Sheer Force wallbreaker and Normalize attacker. Gengar's Ghost typing gives it utility as a spinblocker, making it a good fit on offensive entry hazard-stacking teams, and an important immunity to regular Normal-type Extreme Speed, allowing Gengar to revenge kill Pokemon such as Tough Claws Lucario. However, it also makes Gengar weak to Pursuit and Knock Off, the latter of which being quite popular. Very low bulk makes Gengar vulnerable to faster attackers and the enormous amount of priority in Almost Any Ability, and it means that, if Gengar does not KO the foe, it will most likely get KOed itself. Additionally, the Normalize set is quite useless if Gengar does not get a chance to use Skill Swap. Last but not least, Gengar faces competition from Doublade and Aegislash as an offensive Ghost-type because they have more bulk and resistances, but Gengar is faster and more threatening to bulkier builds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Will-O-Wisp and Hex allows Gengar to cripple common switch-ins such as Goodra and a ton of Poison Heal users before their Toxic Orb has activated, but most Gengar checks do not care about burns that much, and it can backfire against Magic Bounce users. An Illusion set makes good use of Gengar's two immunities to fool the opponent into doing things such as using Fighting-type attacks because they think Gengar is a Lucario, or it can lure in and KO checks for sweepers. No Guard grants Gengar the ability to use 100% accuracy Hypnosis and Focus Blast. Destiny Bond is a good option because, with Gengar's high Speed stat, it can more than often take down a Pokemon that threatens your team. However, the most threatening sweepers in Almost Any Ability use priority and Gengar cannot deal with those without Prankster. Even without Hex, Will-O-Wisp is a decent move that can be used over Taunt on the Sheer Force set and over Mean Look on the Normalize set to cripple walls and physical attackers such as Braviary. Knock Off is an option on the Sheer Force set because it cripples Regenerator + Assault Vest Pokemon such as Goodra, which are the most common Gengar checks, as well as Chansey. Thunderbolt is another option on the Sheer Force set, as it hits bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Suicune harder and also gives Gengar a move that is not completely stopped by Bulletproof. Wonder Room can screw over special walls such as Goodra and Chansey because they are much frailer defensively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulletproof</strong>: Although somewhat rare, Bulletproof users such as Excadrill and Gliscor are immune to Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast, and they can do whatever they want against Gengar unless they get Taunted. Gengar can still defeat Bulletproof users with Sludge Wave, but the most common users either resist or are immune to Poison-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Regenerator + Assault Vest Users</strong>: Regenerator + Assault Vest users, most notably Goodra, Tentacruel, and Meloetta, have little trouble taking hits from the Sheer Force set and making quick work of Gengar in return.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Sneasel hit Gengar for super effective damage with their STAB attacks and can Pursuit trap it as well. However, neither can switch in safely against Focus Blast variants, and the latter cannot switch into Gengar's Poison-type STAB move either.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Thundurus, Raikou, and most Choice Scarf users can easily force Gengar out because of its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Gengar's terrible bulk, priority users such as Entei, Honchkrow, and Scizor make quick work of it if it's not behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Although Gengar defeats most specially bulky Pokemon, the less passive ones such as Zygarde and Snorlax can tank a hit and do huge damage in return. Specially bulky Pokemon with Skill Swap can also give Normalize back to Gengar.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sheer Force": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball hits most types for neutral damage and opposing Ghost-types for super effective damage. Sludge Wave is a secondary STAB move and has good neutral coverage with Shadow Ball. Focus Blast hits Dark-, Normal-, and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Chansey, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Taunt allows Gengar to prevent any status move from being used, which is mostly helpful against special walls that would otherwise be able to use status and recovery moves freely against Gengar, such as Porygon2, but also helps against entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Hippowdon. Substitute also protects Gengar from status and can act as a shield against priority, but it cannot prevent the foe from healing up with recovery moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread optimizes Gengar's ability to break through walls while allowing it to outspeed the majority of Almost Any Ability. A Timid nature is mandatory because Gengar is frail and thus needs to move before the foe if it does not want to faint. Sheer Force grants Gengar a 1.3x boost to all of its attacks with secondary effects, which is all of them. It should, however, be noted that the secondary effects disappear. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Gengar's attacks and works very well with Sheer Force, as the ability negates the recoil damage on all attacks with secondary effects.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gengar works best early- or mid-game to break through defensive cores for teammates or outright sweep bulkier teams itself. If you suspect the opponent is planning on sacrificing a Pokemon against Gengar and you have Substitute, Gengar can use it on the predicted switch, get rid of the sacrificed Pokemon, and come out of it behind a Substitute, forcing the opponent to sacrifice another Pokemon to break it. It is usually a very bad idea to switch Gengar into even neutral attacks because of its low bulk. If you really must, you can, however, make use of Gengar's immunities and switch it into Normal- and Fighting-type moves. You should especially try switching Gengar in against Rapid Spin if entry hazards are up on the opponent's side. Watch out for priority attacks because even weaker users such as Zygarde can KO Gengar with just a little prior damage. Finally, note that Gengar can stall out the PP of walls late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other special attackers such as Goodra and Diancie appreciate Gengar, as it softens or outright breaks through special walls for them. Pokemon that can take on common priority users such as Braviary and Entei are great teammates because of Gengar's weakness to priority. Steel-types such as Doublade and Flash Fire Skarmory are especially good because they resist all priority moves barring Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, and they can take on Doublade anyway, while Sucker Punch is almost nonexistent in the metagame. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Garchomp help Gengar get some extra KOs such as the guaranteed OHKO with Focus Blast on standard Ferrothorn. In return, Gengar's Ghost typing allows it to block Rapid Spin so the entry hazards that its teammates set are not removed. Slow Volt Switch, U-turn, and Baton Pass users such as Magnezone, Scizor, and Sylveon help with bringing Gengar in safely so it can wreak havoc without risking taking damage. Pokemon such as Lucario and Mega Altaria can take advantage of Dark-types that can trap Gengar with Pursuit such as Krookodile.</p>"
      },
      "Normalize": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Skill Swap gives the foe Normalize, turning all of its moves into Normal-type so that it is unable to touch Gengar. Mean Look traps the Pokemon that the opponent switches into Gengar and can let Gengar take it out for the rest of the match. Substitute is an option over Mean Look, as it lets Gengar take advantage of the free turn provided by Skill Swap to create a shield to hide behind and thus be able to safely attack without having to predict the Pokemon coming in. Shadow Ball is Gengar's best STAB attack and hits opposing Ghost-types such as Doublade for super effective damage. Focus Blast hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar and Heatran and has perfect neutral coverage together with Shadow Ball. Sludge Bomb can be used over Focus Blast as a secondary STAB attack that also has good neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball. However, the most relevant Fairy-type, Diancie, is not hit for super effective damage by Sludge Bomb and, without Focus Blast, Gengar becomes much more vulnerable to Pursuit trappers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread combined with a Timid nature optimizes Gengar's Speed so it will be faster than the foe the majority of the time, allowing Gengar to use Skill Swap without taking damage while hitting as hard as possible. Normalize works together with Skill Swap to prevent the foe from touching Gengar as long as Gengar is faster. Black Sludge is the item of choice because, without it, Substitute wears Gengar down way too fast, and this set does not need a power boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Skill Swap against slower foes to make them unable to touch Gengar, set up a Substitute as the opponent switches in something to handle Gengar, and then use the appropriate attack, depending on the Pokemon sent out. If you suspect the opponent is going to switch into another Pokemon, you can use Substitute as the foe switches out and then use Skill Swap, creating another free turn for Gengar to attack. Skill Swap can also be used to stop slower sweepers such as Snorlax and Suicune cold in their tracks. It is most of the time wise not to switch Gengar into any Pokemon with an offensive presence, as Gengar's low bulk results in it disliking even strong resisted hits. However, you can make use of Gengar's two immunities to switch into Normal- and Fighting-type attacks if you really must. Rapid Spin is a move you should especially try to prevent if there are entry hazards up on the opponent's side. Due to Gengar's low bulk, it is ill-advised to stay in against any remotely strong priority user or faster Pokemon unless you're trying to make a prediction. This set does very well against teams with just one Gengar check because, if that one check gets hit by Skill Swap, the opponent is forced to switch to a Pokemon that does not take Gengar on well. Even after you have already used Skill Swap, Gengar checks that rely on Poison Heal can still be screwed by just using Skill Swap again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can take on priority users such as Doublade and Staraptor are good teammates because those foes can easily OHKO Gengar. Steel-types such as Skarmory and Mega Metagross work particularly well thanks to their resistances to most priority moves. Flash Fire Doublade deserves a special mention because it can switch into every priority move except Shadow Sneak and can Pursuit trap the priority users or use Skarmory without Taunt or Whirlwind as setup fodder. If you're using Mean Look on Gengar, fast special attackers such as Shaymin-S and Thundurus appreciate Gengar luring in and trapping special walls such as Chansey and Goodra. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Ferrothorn are great teammates because this set forces a lot of switches, causing foes to take a lot of residual damage, and Gengar's Ghost typing allows it to block Rapid Spin, preserving the entry hazards on the opponent's side. Slow U-turn, Volt Switch, and Baton Pass users such as Scizor, Mega Ampharos, and Togekiss grant Gengar free switches in without the risk of taking heavy damage. Because Gengar is vulnerable to Pursuit, Pokemon that take advantage of Dark-types, especially setup sweepers such as Lucario and Togekiss, are great teammates. Choice Band Adaptability Tyranitar traps most of Gengar's counters, barring Assault Vest + Focus Blast Meloetta, with Pursuit.</p>"

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou is a great pivot in the Almost Any Ability metagame. The combination of its typing, which gives it a single weakness to Ground, and its high Speed and decent bulk allow it to switch in on many Pokemon and pressure them with its STAB moves. Additionally, STAB Volt Switch enables it to get out of unfavorable matchups and do chip damage and is great to keep your momentum up when Raikou forces a foe out. Raikou also does well as a pivot because it's extremely customizable. It can run most abilities, depending on your team's needs, so it can usually check a wide range of Pokemon. Sadly, it can easily get worn down by entry hazards, as it switches in and out a lot. Raikou also has a decent Special Attack stat, which allows it to revenge kill Pokemon and do well versus frailer offensive teams, but it struggles against stall, as it's not strong enough to break most walls. Still, it can be useful against stall by running a Magnet Pull set. While its special bulk is quite good with an Assault Vest, its physical bulk is lacking, making it unable to pivot into physical attackers too many times. It's also fairly predictable, as while it can run many abilities, it's nearly always a pivot and can be fairly easily prepared for.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder is Raikou's best and most powerful STAB move if it has Primordial Sea, helping a bit with Raikou's lack of power. Thunderbolt is for any other sets, as it's more reliable. Both of these moves allow Raikou to hit common threats in AAA for super effective damage, like Skarmory and Suicune. Volt Switch is used to pivot out of threats Raikou can't beat one-on-one while getting free damage. It's also good if you predict a Pokemon to switch out so you can get momentum on the Pokemon that switches in. Shadow Ball is a standard coverage move that is mostly used because of Raikou's lack of better options. It hits a few Pokemon harder than Raikou's STAB moves, such as Latios. Hidden Power Ice rounds off BoltBeam coverage with Raikou's STAB moves, allowing it to hit threats such as Zygarde and Landorus. Hidden Power Grass is used specifically to hit Manaphy with an Electric immunity preventing Raikou from being setup bait for it, and also to beat Water / Ground types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest is the preferred item to help Raikou with its job of switching into Pokemon, particularly special attackers. Choice Specs can be used to increase Raikou's damage output, making it more threatening. It doesn't miss the ability to switch moves too much, as it usually wants to use its STAB moves anyway. Primordial Sea allows Raikou to switch in on Fire-types like Heatran and Victini, which greatly adds to Raikou's pivoting capabilities. Additionally, it gives a much-needed boost to Raikou's STAB moves, as it allows Raikou to use Thunder over Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Regenerator gives Raikou more longevity; although it doesn't let it beat any additional Pokemon, it helps it check them for a longer time. A Timid nature is used to maximize Raikou's Speed. The EVs are used to allow Raikou to hit as hard and as fast as possible. The leftover EVs are put into HP to increase its general bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though it resists Brave Bird, don't switch Raikou into Gale Wings Pokemon recklessly, as it may fail to absorb two consecutive blows due to its low Defense. It can only safely switch into Skarmory, so don't use it as your only Flying-type check. When using Primordial Sea, preserve Raikou when facing a weather team, as it can easily stop sweeps by stopping the weather. Raikou checks a lot of special attackers, so don't be afraid to switch it in on them, unless you need to keep it healthy, as it's a great way to put exert pressure and get momentum. Against most teams, it's wise to spam Electric moves. They allow Raikou to either do quite some damage or get momentum. However, watch out when the opponent has a Pokemon that often runs Volt Absorb or Motor Drive, particularly Manaphy. Raikou can outspeed and KO a lot of the Ground-types it wants to hit with Hidden Power Ice, so they aren't a huge problem. Especially when using Regenerator, spam Volt Switch to gain momentum and get health back at the same time. With Primordial Sea Raikou puts a lot of pressure on Heatran and Victini, deterring them from using Fire-type moves. It can take all attacks from Heatran pretty easily, but you can't switch it in on Victini's Choice Band-boosted U-turn too often. When playing against stall teams, don't rely on Raikou to do any damage to the opposing team, as it can't hurt Pokemon like Goodra or Chansey at all. Rather, try to switch it in when you need it to absorb a hit with something and use Volt Switch to get chip damage. With Volt Switch Raikou can bring in wallbreakers that have trouble coming in safely, even if Volt Switch itself doesn't do major damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raikou is usually used on balanced or offensive teams to absorb hits and easily gain momentum. It shouldn't be used on other teams because it's not bulky enough to wall threats throughout the match. Gale Wings Skarmory makes a good core with Raikou, as it's able to keep up the offensive pressure with Swords Dance, can check the physical attackers that threaten Raikou, and has good type synergy with it. In general, Raikou likes to have a Pokemon to absorb physical hits on the team. It also appreciates having a strong wallbreaker like Latios or Heracross on the team, which it can easily bring in on walls via Volt Switch while they help Raikou to tear down stall teams in return. Entry hazard stacking works well in combination with Raikou because Raikou forces a lot of switches. Ferrothorn and Deoxys are examples of Pokemon that can support Raikou with Spikes. Similarly, Raikou likes hazard removal. As it's grounded and tends to switch in a lot, it will be hurt badly by a combination of Stealth Rock and Spikes. This will prevent Raikou from switching in as easily and thus make it harder for your team to absorb special hits. Starmie is a good option for an offensive Rapid Spin user, while the aforementioned Skarmory can support it with Defog. Raikou synergizes well with U-turn and other Volt Switch users, like Victini, because they can keep switching to each other while checking whatever is on the field.</p>"
      },
      "Magnet Pull": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's best reliable STAB move. It allows Raikou to hit many threats for decent damage and hits most Steel-types neutrally. Volt Switch is used for pivoting and inflicting chip damage when Raikou is not facing a Steel-type and can't beat the threat. Aura Sphere is used to hit Steel-types super effectively, allowing Raikou to trap them more efficiently. Specifically, it's its best move versus common threats like Ferrothorn and Heatran. The final slot can go to multiple moves. Shadow Ball is one of Raikou's stronger coverage moves and has great coverage with Aura Sphere. It can be used to hit Pokemon like Latios and Doublade hard. A Hidden Power can round out specific coverage. Ice has great coverage with Raikou's Electric STAB moves and makes it perform better against Ground-types, while Grass is useful against Ground-types too, like Hippowdon, but doesn't make Raikou setup fodder for Motor Drive Manaphy. However, Pokemon like Zygarde will have an easier time against you.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs is the best option on this set, as Raikou needs it to do its job of removing Steel-types well. With Choice Specs, it can 2HKO Heatran and Ferrothorn, even with maximum Special Defense investment, while without this power boost, many Pokemon will avoid the OHKO or 2HKO, making Raikou unable to beat them at times. Magnet Pull allows Raikou to trap the Steel-types it can usually easily switch in on and KO them. Rash is the nature on this set, as Aura Sphere is event locked into it. Sadly, this makes Raikou unable to outspeed Pokemon with base 110 Speed, but Aura Sphere's importance for this set usually outweighs this. If you don't feel like you need it, you can use Timid to outspeed everything up to base 115 Speed, though. The EVs are fairly straightforward: . Raikou needs maximum Speed to outspeed positive-natured base 100s by one point, while the Special Attack EVs maximize its damage output, as Raikou is fairly weak otherwise. The final 4 EVs are put into HP to give Raikou a little more bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Raikou is able to switch in on Skarmory and defensive variants of Heatran quite well, so don't be afraid to do so to remove them for your team. More offensive Steel-types need more caution to trap, but after a KO or a free switch, Raikou can revenge kill Pokemon like Genesect and Lucario quite well. Don't let Lucario boost, though, as Raikou isn't bulky enough to tank boosted Extreme Speed. Be aware that Raikou can't trap Doublade due to its secondary Ghost typing. Be careful with what you lock Raikou in; don't lock it into an Electric STAB move if a Pokemon with an Electric immunity like Manaphy with Volt Absorb or Motor Drive is on the opposing team. Volt Switch is safe to use, though, if you've trapped something. Aura Sphere is less risky, but it can give momentum to your opponent if they have a Ghost-type like Gengar or Hoopa, both of which can put enormous offensive pressure on your team. Raikou's other moves are quite weak, so they can be taken advantage of as well. When you don't have to trap Steel-types anymore, you can generally play quite recklessly with Raikou unless you need it to revenge kill a threat like Victini. You can put a lot of pressure on the opponent by getting Raikou in on Pokemon it threatens and outspeeds and using Volt Switch to gain momentum. Raikou can also function as a catch-all lead, often being able to get a positive matchup by just Volt Switching out of most foes. Raikou can't damage most opponents on stall teams well. Try to take out their Steel-type if possible, and spam Volt Switch otherwise to get your other Pokemon in safely. You don't need to be careful with Raikou once their Steel-type has been removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Raikou set should be used to support Pokemon that dislike Steel-types. Gale Wings users such as Braviary and Honchkrow are good partners for this reason. These Pokemon also cover Raikou's Ground weakness. This Raikou set fits best on offensive teams, as it can pressure the opponent and gain momentum pretty easily. As Raikou can provide free switches with Volt Switch, strong sweepers such as Lucario like its presence. Motor Drive Manaphy and Ground-types tend to switch in on Raikou, so having something to take them on is a must. Pokemon like Shaymin-S can switch in on their STAB moves and hit them super effectively with their own, but they can't switch in on Manaphy's Ice Beam. Wallbreakers also enjoy the presence of Raikou on a team. It can get them in safely so they can try to break the opponent's team. Latios is a good example that also enjoys Raikou's ability to weaken Steel-types.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Levitate, Thick Fat, Desolate Land, and similar abilities can be run to give Raikou resistances or immunities to types a team struggles with. Desolate Land also gives Raikou a Fire-type Weather Ball. Weather Ball can also be used on the Primordial Sea set to beat Ground-types more easily. Intimidate is another good option to let Raikou switch in on physical attackers better. If you want an increased damage output, a Sheer Force set with Life Orb is an option; however, its power is still not great. Nevertheless, it can be a viable cleaner. Extrasensory is an option to hit Poison- and Fighting-types, although most are hit hard enough by Raikou's STAB moves. Raikou could run a mixed set with Refrigerate Extreme Speed, giving it a good tool against Gale Wings users to avoid taking damage. However, it is extremely weak, so its niche is limited. Light Screen and Reflect are viable options on Raikou, as it can set them up pretty easily when forcing something out and can use Volt Switch to bring in other Pokemon that want the support. Calm Mind can help Raikou clean teams late-game when it is done pivoting. Poison Heal is often a good option on such a set for some passive recovery while being unable to be worn down by status. Finally, Mold Breaker can be used to get past Volt Absorb and Motor Drive Pokemon, specifically Manaphy; however, it doesn't do much otherwise.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Manaphy</strong>: Motor Drive Manaphy can wall Raikou while possibly getting a Speed boost from its STAB moves. Afterwards, it can set up and possibly sweep your team, so be extremely careful when facing it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Zygarde can stop Raikou from getting momentum. The former two do not fear Hidden Power Ice that much, while the latter can revenge kill Raikou with Extreme Speed if it is at low health.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Raikou has no good way of getting past special walls. Although its attacks have decent power, it's nothing extraordinary. Therefore, Pokemon like Chansey and Goodra can easily wall Raikou the entire match.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Speed Users</strong>: Raikou's physical bulk is disappointing, so Extreme Speed users can often pick it off when it's taken a bit of damage. Dragonite and Entei are good users of the move and can even switch in on Raikou in a pinch.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Entei is a wonderful revenge killer in Almost Any Ability, packing amazing offensive utility and checking many threats. Its high Attack and decent bulk allow it to fit on a lot of teams, checking a myriad of threats and being a general nuisance to opponents. Sacred Fire is an amazing STAB move, packing high power and a devastating burn chance. Refrigerate is by far its best set and can revenge kill a large portion of the offensive metagame, being able to clean easily when its checks and counters are worn down. Entei also resists Pixilate and Refrigerate Extreme Speed from users such as Lucario, further enhancing its offensive utility and cleaning capabilities. Unfortunately, it suffers from a few substantial flaws. First and foremost, it is weak to Stealth Rock and therefore needs significant entry hazard support. It also has a very subpar movepool, with little coverage, and is consequently walled by some common mons. Flash Fire Steel-types in general hard wall most sets, and Entei's shallow movepool means it is rather predictable. Many other potential sets are inferior to Refrigerate as a result. Extreme Speed also forces it into an Adamant nature. Despite these flaws, Entei is a very effective revenge killer and wallbreaker in the Almost Any Ability metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pixilate Extreme Speed is an interesting option for Entei, allowing it to bluff Refrigerate but hit Pokemon like Lucario and Mega Gyarados for more damage. Unfortunately it doesn't handle Gale Wings users as well, but considering it's often paired with Skarmory this can be a good option. Serene Grace is a set for annoyance; on such a set, Sacred Fire has a higher burn chance than Will-O-Wisp when accuracy is taken into account, and Entei has both Body Slam and Iron Head for Paraflinch shenanigans. Desolate Land provides a powerful Sacred Fire and a convenient Water-type immunity, if you want those on your team. Poison Heal is an option because of Entei's good bulk and both offensive and defensive presence. Assault Vest + Regenerator is a decent option that walls special attackers while burning physical attackers. Mold Breaker is a viable option that bypasses Flash Fire, which can create momentum due to its unexpectedness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flash Fire Steel-types</strong>: Entei's lack of Ground-type coverage moves leaves it completely walled by most Flash Fire Steel-types, primarily Doublade and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Primordial Sea</strong>: Most defensive Primordial Sea users wall Entei because of the Fire immunity they bring. Zapdos does not wall the Refrigerate set, however.</p> <p><strong>Poison Heal Suicune</strong>: If it has already activated its Toxic Orb, Suicune hard counters all Entei sets besides Tinted Lens in the sun.</p> <p><strong>Poison Heal Regirock</strong>: Regirock also needs its Toxic Orb activated, but it counters all Entei sets if it has activated it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon easily threaten Entei out with a KO if they resist Extreme Speed</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers</strong>: Special Attackers that don't really care about burns and can tank a hit often can revenge kill Entei if they pack enough power.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Refrigerate Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Extreme Speed is the primary move on the set, capable of revenge killing Gale Wings users and Dragons that plague the tier. It packs a solid punch and dents potential switch-ins as well. Sacred Fire is very powerful while having a nasty burn chance, making it a deadly STAB move. The burn chance makes Entei extremely hard to switch into unless the switch-in is immune to burns, as most Pokemon in AAA don't want to be burned. Stone Edge hits Victini and other Fire-types, which are immune to the burns from Sacred Fire and resist both main moves. The 4th slot is a filler move. Will-O-Wisp burns potential switch-ins and Primordial Sea users, while Iron Head hits Rock-types such as Diancie. Bulldoze is an option for pseudo-EdgeQuake coverage and hits Steel-types for decent damage, and Facade hits very hard if Entei becomes paralyzed or poisoned.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and nature maximize Entei's power and speed, and will allow it to outspeed everything up to max Speed Rotom-A. Life Orb is the preferred item; this Entei likes to switch moves easily and isn’t afraid of being worn down as it cleans. Choice Band is an option to mitigate recoil, but locks you into a move, which is generally less desirable on this set. An Adamant nature is required for the use of Extreme Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Entei is best used as a revenge killer and cleaner against opposing offensive teams. Its firepower and coverage hit a wide variety of threats, making it very dangerous when used correctly. However, it has limited longevity with Life Orb, so it would rather not switch into attacks. If you can outspeed and safely KO the opponent, Sacred Fire should be used to spread burns across opposing teams and hammer switch-ins. Victini also tries to switch in somewhat often, as it resists both of Entei's primary moves, so Stone Edge will nearly OHKO it for the rest of the team. Sacred Fire has low PP, so be wary of it in the case Entei's Life Orb gets knocked off or you choose to run Choice Band. It's a good idea to scout Flash Fire and Primordial Sea users before you spam Sacred Fire; this will keep you from losing momentum in the case one of them switches in. On the other hand, Sacred Fire is very dangerous before Poison Heal users have activated their Toxic Orb, so Entei is very good in the early game against teams that use Poison Heal Pokemon to wall Entei. This set is very good at cleaning once its checks and counters have been eliminated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entei appreciates entry hazard support as a cleaner especially, and Deoxys-S does this wonderfully for offensive teams. Strong Electric- and Grass-types that handle Suicune make great partners, as well as Illusion users that can bait it in. Magnet Pull users that don't mind Flash Fire make good partners as well. Entei needs hazard removal, so Magic Bounce users are good teammates to prevent opposing Flash Fire Pokemon from setting hazards as it switches out. Entei also loves wallbreakers, especially those that bait Steel-types. Tinted Lens Latios is an outstanding partner for baiting in and KOing Steel-types while being able to remove hazards with Defog. Outside of Flash Fire Steel-types that can be trapped, Doublade is OHKOed by Mold Breaker Victini, another good partner. Doublade counters such as Mandibuzz are great for Entei as well.</p>"

      "Tinted Lens Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sacred Fire is almost impossible to switch into thanks to burns and its insane power backed by Tinted Lens. Extreme Speed is great with Tinted Lens, as it allows Entei to revenge kill threats it normally can't, such as Chlorophyll Heatran and Scizor. It is also capable of cleaning in a pinch. Stone Edge is the first filler move, hitting Fire-types and Flash Fire Aegislash for decent damage, while Facade is another filler move that will hit pretty hard in case you switch Entei into a status move. Iron Head can OHKO Diancie and hit Rock-types super effectively, while Flare Blitz is an option for extra power, notably OHKOing Latios and 2HKOing Diancie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and Adamant nature allow Entei to outspeed anything up to Timid nature maximum Speed Rotom-A and hit as hard as possible. Tinted Lens allows this set to hit Pokemon that resist its moves for double damage, so pokemon that otherwise 1/2 resist its moves take neutral damage. This allows Entei to hit typical switch-ins very hard. Choice Band is preferred for better longevity and wallbreaking power. This set hits a lot of normal checks for massive damage and can revenge kill some threats it can't otherwise touch such as the aforementioned Chlorophyll Heatran. It can also 3HKO Suicune and can burn it if its Toxic Orb hasn't yet activated.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Entei performs as a wallbreaker rather than a revenge killer and loves to find opportunities to spam high-powered attacks and leave holes in the opponent's team. This set is one that shouldn't be played recklessly; it just wants to attempt to destroy the opponent's team whenever it can get in safely. Entei is great at spreading burns even when there are Pokemon that can take its hits, so Sacred Fire is extremely useful despite its low PP. Scouting Flash Fire and Primordial Sea users, such as Ferrothorn, is very important for its success. Use the switches Entei forces to punch holes in the opposition.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entei needs team support to beat Flash Fire Steel-types and Primordial Sea users; until these are eliminated Entei is generally not very effective. Magnet Pull users that don't mind Flash Fire Steel-types make good partners. The Tinted Lens set greatly appreciates Drought support to further power up its Sacred Fire. A Flash Fire Doublade switch-in, such as Mandibuzz, is recommended. This set is best paired with entry hazard stackers, such as Deoxys-S, and also likes hazard control from Defog users such as Gale Wings Skarmory. Gale Wings Skarmory is also a great partner because it can clean behind the carnage created by Entei. Magic Bounce users are good to prevent momentum loss against foes such as Flash Fire Ferrothorn, which may attempt to set hazards as Entei switches out. Pairing this up with another Tinted Lens user, especially one that normally gets Steel-types to switch-in, can create a deadly wallbreaking core. Tinted Lens Latios does exactly this.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Huge bulk and a decent defensive typing let Suicune take on the majority of the physical threats in the AAA metagame, and coupled with Calm Mind, this makes Suicune a great wincon for stall and balance that can outlast a lot of its checks because of Scald's burn chance and Poison Heal's recovery. Its great Speed tier for a defensive Pokemon also helps it sweep by allowing Suicune to phaze opposing phazers before they can shuffle Suicune out. However, an overreliance on Scald, due to Suicune's low Special Attack, makes it struggle with foes that don't mind a burn and can hit back in return, such as certain Perish Song users, Skill Swap users like Celebi that can remove Suicune's Poison Heal, Desolate Land users such as Heatran, and Poison Heal users with enough power to break through Suicune. Without Roar, Suicune also may end up as setup fodder for Pokemon that don't mind Scald, such as opposing Suicune and Calm Mind Latios, although Ice Beam also does decent damage to the latter. Finally, its lack of instant recovery holds it back from functioning as a dedicated wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive sets with Primordial Sea face some competition from Pokemon like Manaphy but distinguish themselves with added bulk and access to supportive moves such as Tailwind. Choice Specs is a very viable item on sets like these to maximize Suicune's damage output. Magnet Pull can also be used with Choice Specs to trap Pokemon like Skarmory and some Heatran without stacking weaknesses with Fire-, Ground-, or Fighting-types. Volt Absorb grants Suicune an immunity to Electric-type moves, making it a great answer to Pokemon that would otherwise be able to check it, such as Thundurus. Mold Breaker, while not as much of an obvious improvement as other viable abilities, allows Suicune to ignore the odd Water Absorb and Storm Drain and break through a few Unaware walls such as Mew. Regenerator helps Suicune stay healthy without wasting moveslots on Protect or Rest + Sleep Talk, and Suicune distinguishes itself as a Regenerator user with access to Roar and all-around great bulk. Hidden Power Ground allows Suicune to defeat Heatran and most other Desolate Land users without having to resort to racking up entry hazard damage with Roar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Desolate Land Users</strong>: Desolate Land users, most notably Victini and Heatran, fear nothing from Scald and can do whatever they want against Suicune. However, with entry hazards up, they fail to defeat Roar variants in the long term.</p> <p><strong>Strong Pokemon</strong>: Exceptionally strong Pokemon such as Hoopa, Calm Mind + Adaptability Latios, and Manaphy have or can attain enough power to break through Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Celebi and Shaymin-S can switch into Scald and defeat Suicune with Skill Swap or Perish Song in Celebi's case or break through it with brute force in Shaymin-S's case.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Thundurus and Raikou hit Suicune super effectively with their STAB attacks but have a hard time breaking through it once it has boosted its Special Defense with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Phazers such as opposing Suicune and Skarmory can stop Suicune from sweeping by forcing it to switch out, getting rid of any possible Calm Mind boost and thus preventing a sweep. However, they lose in a last Pokemon situation and, if your own Suicune is faster, can be phazed before they can phaze your Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Although many special walls are setup bait for Suicune, multiple special walls can sometimes PP stall Suicune because they don't take that much damage from Scald. In particular, walls using Unaware have an easy time doing this because they don't care about Suicune's Special Attack boosts. Water-resistant Pokemon with Poison Heal, such as Vaporeon, Celebi, Slowbro, and Slowking, also deserve a mention because they will often outlast Suicune.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Suicune's main way of dealing damage to the foe and helps Suicune sweep by threatening Pokemon that switch in with a 30% chance to burn. Calm Mind grants Suicune a way of boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense, which, coupled with its high Defense, turns Suicune into a formidable setup sweeper. Protect gives Suicune a shield to hide behind to recover more of its health with Poison Heal. Roar allows Suicune to defeat opposing Suicune without Roar, phazes Pokemon that would otherwise use Suicune as setup fodder, and, coupled with entry hazards, allows Suicune to defeat Desolate Land users such as Heatran and Victini in the long run. Ice Beam is another solid option in the last moveslot, as it deals with Grass-types such as Shaymin-S and some Celebi variants, as well as Dragon-types such as Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature maximizes Suicune's physical bulk, allowing it to take on physical attackers such as Doublade and Entei while it boosts its Special Defense and Special Attack with Calm Mind. A Toxic Orb together with Poison Heal gives Suicune great passive recovery so that it is not worn down too fast and grants Suicune a pseudo-immunity to status ailments.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's often a good idea to use Scald a lot early-game, as burns wear down a lot of Suicune's checks. Set up on Pokemon that cannot do a lot of damage to Suicune, such as Doublade, Chansey, Entei, and non-Desolate Land Heatran. If facing foes immune to Water, have a teammate set up as many entry hazards as possible, and then send in Suicune shuffle the foe around with Roar, slowly whittling down their health. However, if the opponent has a Magic Bounce user, this can be turned against you. Protect can be used to scout the moves of foes, particularly Choice-locked Pokemon such as some Genesect and Raikou. Watch out with using Protect, though, as while the extra Poison Heal recovery is often appreciated, it also provides a free turn for the foe to do whatever they want, such as set up a boosting move or lay down entry hazards. Do not be too afraid of super effective attacks because Suicune usually has enough bulk and recovery to take at least one of them, especially with a Calm Mind boost under its belt. You have to be very careful around Pokemon that can carry Knock Off, Trick, or a status move that doesn't inflict poison before Suicune has activated its Toxic Orb, as failing to do so heavily cripples Suicune for the rest of the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune struggles a lot with Pokemon immune to Water, especially Desolate Land users such as Heatran, so Pokemon that can take them on, such as Goodra, are good teammates. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran that can set entry hazards are great teammates to force the opposing team to take extra chip damage, especially if Suicune is using Roar. Other defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory and Chansey, make for great partners because they can cover each other's weaknesses quite well on a stall team. Additionally, Suicune is quite a momentum killer on purely offensive teams and thus should not be used on one under normal circumstances. Pokemon like Latios and Refrigerate Thundurus, which can take on Grass-types such as Celebi and Water-types such as opposing Roar Suicune, are great teammates because Suicune struggles a lot with them.</p>"
      },
      "Unaware": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Suicune's primary way of dealing damage and can cripple Pokemon that switch in with a burn. Calm Mind turns Suicune into a fearsome setup sweeper by increasing its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it stronger and harder to take down. Rest recovers all of Suicune's health and relieves it of any status condition it may have. Sleep Talk makes Suicune not a sitting duck after using Rest by granting it chances to use its moves while asleep. Roar can be used over Sleep Talk to improve Suicune's matchup against Pokemon that are immune to Water-type attacks, such as Desolate Land Heatran, by shuffling them around and slowly wearing them down with entry hazards. It also allows Suicune to phaze slower opposing phazers such as Mandibuzz.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature maximizes Suicune's physical bulk, allowing it to take strong physical hits while boosting its Special Defense with Calm Mind. Leftovers grants Suicune passive recovery to increase its longevity. Unaware helps Suicune take on boosting Pokemon such as Snorlax and Lucario.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, it is often wise to click Scald as much as possible, as many of Suicune's switch-ins heavily dislike a burn and cannot wall Suicune as effectively when inflicted with one. Suicune can set up on passive Pokemon such as Chansey and physical attackers such as Entei that it checks because they fail to break through Suicune's solid Defense. Thanks to Unaware, it can also set up on boosting sweepers such as Mega Charizard X. If facing foes immune to Water, such as Desolate Land Heatran and Victini, have a teammate set up as many entry hazards as possible and then send in Suicune to shuffle the opposing team around with Roar, slowly whittling down their health. If not using Roar, simply baiting them in and then switching out as they come in also reduces their health if entry hazards are up. Suicune has a decent matchup against all playstyles, especially against passive stall teams without an Unaware user that doesn't mind Scald burns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon-types such as Latios and Goodra that can take on Desolate Land users such as Heatran and Victini are great teammates because Suicune has a lot to fear from them. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Ferrothorn are a must if using Roar, as without them, Desolate Land users still don't have a lot to fear from Suicune. Grass-types such as Celebi and Ferrothorn can be quite annoying, as can bulky Water-types, making Pokemon like Latios and Desolate Land Heatran good teammates to take them on. Other bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Goodra can cover each other's weaknesses and form a stall team together. Because stall teams tend to be somewhat passive, Suicune's teammates really appreciate it checking boosting sweepers such as Swords Dance Absol and Lucario.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>With great base stats all around, including 90 / 106 / 106 bulk and an incredible base 130 Special Attack stat, as well as an excellent movepool, Heatran has all the tools it needs to be a solid pokemon in the Almost Any Ability metagame. Because of this, Heatran can viably use several abilities, making it extremely unpredictable between its offensive and defensive movesets. Its typing blesses it with resistances to common priority moves, including Gale Wings Brave Bird and Refrigerate or Pixilate Extreme Speed. However, its typing also gives it weaknesses to three of the most common attacking types: Fighting, Ground, and Water. Lack of a reliable source of recovery means that more defensive Heatran sets get worn down easily, while Flash Fire's omnipresence in the metagame severely hinders offensive Heatran's effectiveness. Heatran also often finds itself trapped by the ever-so-common Magnet Pull, making it extremely easy to get rid of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heatran can run Choice items to some effect even without Chlorophyll; Choice Scarf Heatran is by no means bad, and in AAA it can easily take advantage of a number of abilities such as Desolate Land, Sheer Force, and even Levitate. Choice Specs can work with each of those, besides Sheer Force, as well. In terms of items, Heatran can run Shed Shell, as Magnet Pull takes care of Heatran so easily. Still, the loss of reliable recovery will often hurt Heatran more than not getting trapped helps. Heatran can also run several more viable abilities; it's a great setter of sun with Drought, having access to Stealth Rock, Roar, and Taunt and being able to maintain offensive pressure. If Magic Bounce is becoming a problem with these support moves, Heatran can run a Mold Breaker set to some success; another great thing about Mold Breaker is that Heatran doesn't have to worry about Flash Fire Pokemon soaking up Lava Plumes like they normally do. Another way to take full advantage of Heatran's support moves is by use of Prankster; it gets a wonderful movepool to exploit it with, including Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Stealth Rock, coupled with Fire Blast or Lava Plume to ensure it isn't complete Magic Bounce bait. Finally, Heatran can also utilize a Sheer Force Life Orb moveset with one of the strongest Fire Blasts in the metagame along with a Sheer Force-boosted Flash Cannon and Earth Power. Torment is also an option, allowing Heatran to check many switch-ins such as Latios better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flash Fire and Primordial Sea</strong>: Flash Fire users such as Ferrothorn and Scizor can switch into most Heatran sets with impunity, although many of them do not enjoy taking fully invested Earth Powers. Primordial Sea on the same Pokemon also takes away intense sunlight, meaning that even if the Primordial Sea user switches out, Desolate Land Heatran will be weaker than before.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Pursuit</strong>: Lack of recovery hinders Heatran's longevity once these two are in play.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Many Magnet Pull users such as opposing Heatran and Rotom-W will come equipped with moves to defeat Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Chansey</strong>: Magic Bounce Chansey can easily switch into and wall Heatran, aside from Eruption sets.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest Goodra</strong>: Although Heatran can sometimes cripple it, for the most part Goodra will defeat it one-on-one. Tentacruel is also noteworthy, as it can not only pressure Heatran with Knock Off and Scald but also Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky, Powerful Fire-Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Tinted Lens Latias and Latios and Hydreigon can all switch in pretty well and threaten Heatran, the former two with powerful unresisted Draco Meteors and the latter with Mega Launcher-boosted Dark Pulses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "MagmaTran": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm is generally Heatran's go-to move because of Magma Storm's trapping abilities. Heatran can lure and sometimes end up taking out very annoying, bulky Pokemon that other Heatran sets cannot, such as Assault Vest Goodra. Earth Power is Heatran's first line of defense against Flash Fire Pokemon, hitting most of them, such as Scizor and Doublade, hard. It's also this moveset's only move with perfect accuracy. Substitute not only eases prediction but also allows Heatran to defeat Ferrothorn, a common switch-in, in a one-on-one scenario. Both options in the last slot complement Magma Storm. Metal Sound lets Heatran lower the Special Defense of and eventually defeat Calm Mind Suicune and Chansey, while Taunt does almost the same thing, except without the miss chance. There isn't too much of a difference, except that Taunt Heatran has a chance to get PP stalled by Suicune.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Desolate Land provides a nice power boost to Heatran's Magma Storm, allowing it to nab many KOs that it otherwise would not get. More importantly, it gives Heatran a very useful Water immunity that allows it to easily switch in on almost all special Water types, including Manaphy and Suicune. The EV spread is modified for this purpose. 248 HP / 28 SpD ensures that standard Manaphy cannot break Heatran's Substitutes even after it uses Tail Glow twice. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack because Heatran needs as much power as it can get to compensate for Magma Storm's low PP. Leftovers increases Heatran's longevity; the recovery adds up very quickly, especially if Heatran is behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Heatran threatens many Pokemon out, it's usually a good idea to use Magma Storm on the Pokemon it threatens; if it switches out, the switch-in usually takes hefty damage, while if it stays in, it gets trapped and KOed. On a more defensive note, try to keep Heatran away from Knock Off, as it is incredibly reliant on Leftovers; powerful unresisted hits, as sometimes Leftovers does not heal fast enough; and moves such as Zapdos's Discharge, because paralysis greatly limits Heatran's ability to do its job effectively. There are some special matchups in which Heatran must be played differently, however. Against Flash Fire Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, use Substitute first, Metal Sound once, and then repeated Earth Powers until they either switch out or faint. Against Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon, try to get a free Substitute up; if that is impossible, go straight for Magma Storm.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog, Rapid Spin, and Magic Bounce users such as Skarmory, Excadrill, and Zapdos are very important when using this particular Heatran moveset due to Heatran's tendency to get worn down easily. Deoxys-S can set entry hazards which are helpful due to Heatran's tendency to force switches. Flash Fire Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor are good teammates due to their ability to take on the Fire-types that take advantage of Heatran's sun. Flying-types have very good synergy with Heatran, as its only weaknesses are to Ground and Fighting, both of which Flying-types resist. Landorus and Gliscor have perfect synergy with Heatran as a result. Special sweepers have an easier time sweeping thanks to Heatran's ability to lure in and trap common special walls such as Goodra and non-Magic Bounce Chansey. Other Fire-types, specifically Entei and Victini, appreciate Heatran's ability to take advantage of checks to common Fire-type spam. Finally, Wish users such as Vaporeon can replenish Heatran's health, which solves one of its main issues in needing recovery.</p>"
      },
      "ChloroTran": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Eruption under the sun is definitely the scariest move in the metagame; it even goes as far as having a chance to OHKO Victini and getting an almost guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey and Suicune. Fire Blast should only be used if Heatran's health is below 73%, as that is when it outdamages Eruption. Earth Power is the coverage move used to deal solid damage to Flash Fire Pokemon such as Doublade, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. The last moveslot is hardly ever used but can still be useful. Solar Beam gets the guaranteed OHKO on many bulky Water-types, Hidden Power Electric is Heatran's best way of damaging Flash Fire Skarmory, and Will-O-Wisp is an option that cripples Assault Vest Goodra and Assault Vest Tentacruel on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With Chlorophyll, Heatran can outspeed the entire non-Choice Scarf metagame barring Deoxys-S. Unfortunately, because Eruption forces Heatran to have a Quiet Nature, many Choice Scarf users can still outspeed Heatran in the sun. Special Attack and Speed are maximized to let Heatran hit as hard and go first as often as possible, while the 4 Defense EVs ensure that Download users, most of which are physical attackers, get a Special Attack boost. Choice Specs is far and away the best choice for an item, due to the sheer power it brings. Upon further inspection, Heatran can't really afford to run any other item, because the rest are simply not enough to secure many OHKOs. Besides, Heatran is only using one move most of the time anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try not to let Heatran take any damage, including from priority moves. If Stealth Rock can be removed, it should be removed. Most of the time, if Heatran has a chance of switching in but must take damage to do so, don't switch it in, because any damage taken results in a power deduction. If Heatran still ends up taking a bit of damage and falls below 73.3%, Fire Blast is stronger than Eruption. However, in some cases, a weakened Eruption is enough to clean up teams without having a miss. If Heatran is at full health and there are no opposing Flash Fire Pokemon, just use Eruption, even if the foe is a Suicune or something of the sort. This allows Heatran to not have to switch out and switch back in to use Eruption. However, if you see a Pokemon that obviously has Flash Fire, note that there is almost no situation where it won't directly switch in. Avoid using a Fire-type move when this happens, as this will give the Flash Fire Pokemon a free turn or a free Pursuit. Finally, try not to use Heatran outside of sun, because it gets trapped by Magnet Pull extremely easily without sun support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drought is key here; without sun, ChloroTran cannot function properly. Zapdos is typically a good setter, due to its ability to switch into Gale Wings Pokemon, remove entry hazards with Defog, and bring Heatran in with a slow Volt Switch; Infernape is also noteworthy due to its access to Taunt, Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Fire-type STAB attacks. Entry hazard support from a Pokemon like Deoxys-S or the aforementioned Infernape can be very helpful in securing KOs on certain Pokemon, such as Victini, Azumarill, and Gyarados. However, Heatran also hates hazards on its side of the field, so hazard control in the form of Rapid Spin, Defog, and Magic Bounce is vital to ensure that Heatran does not take any damage in order to keep Eruption as strong as possible. Tentacruel, Skarmory, and Chansey are good options for those forms of hazard control, respectively. In a similar way, Poison Heal Vaporeon is an excellent teammate for Heatran because of its ability to not only bring Heatran in safely with Baton Pass, but also its ability to completely replenish Heatran's health with Wish. Trapping is also very useful in helping Heatran sweep. Pursuit trapping from, for example, Choice Band Adaptability Tyranitar gets rid of the main things that can switch in to Heatran: RegenVest Goodra and RegenVest Tentacruel. Finally, Magnet Pull Pokemon such as Rotom-W can trap and defeat the Flash Fire Steel-Types that can stop a Heatran sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Magnet Pull": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt prevents Skarmory and Scizor from using Roost, Ferrothorn from using Leech Seed and Thunder Wave, and other Steel-types from using various status moves. Fire Blast OHKOes almost all non-Flash Fire Steel-types and is used over Heatran's other Fire-type moves because it deals more damage to Levitate Heatran. However, Flamethrower can still be used if the low accuracy is too much of an issue. Earth Power is the main option for whittling down Flash Fire Steel-types after they have been Taunted. It OHKOes opposing non-Levitate Heatran, is super effective against all Steel-types neutral to Fire, and has perfect accuracy. Stealth Rock is an obligatory move in any competitive Pokemon team, and Magnet Pull Heatran can pretty much set it up for free, as most of the Pokemon it traps cannot hurt it. However, if Flash Fire Skarmory is a problem or another teammate is running Stealth Rock, Hidden Power Electric, or any other special coverage move for that matter, can be used.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magnet Pull makes Heatran a great partner to many wallbreakers and sweepers. Steel-types are easily one of the most dominant types in AAA both offensively and defensively, and once they have been trapped and removed, many sweepers that are held back by Steel-types have the chance to sweep. Air Balloon is used to get off two Fire Blasts against Levitate Heatran and potentially beat some Ground-types one-on-one once all the Steel-Types are out of the picture. Charcoal can be used if Fire Blast needs a bit of a power boost, although most of the time that power isn't needed, while Leftovers is another option if Heatran wants to survive for longer. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are used because Heatran aims to trap and defeat as many Steel-types as possible; it is also thus able to Speed tie with opposing Timid Heatran. The bulk isn't too important anyway. Finally, 4 Defense EVs give Download Pokemon a Special Attack boost, which most of them do not appreciate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to avoid switching in Heatran directly, as it doesn't want to take too much damage. Don't switch Heatran in on any status move (besides Toxic and Will-O-Wisp of course), as this will hinder its ability to trap certain Pokemon. After all trappable Steel-types are out of the way, Heatran essentially becomes fodder unless a use for it can somehow be salvaged. Most of the time, after KOing a Steel-type, it should just stay in and Taunt the Pokemon that comes in to prevent it from setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Once Steel-type foes are out of the picture, many Pokemon have on the opportunity to suddenly punch holes into the opposing team. In particular, certain sweepers such as Tail Glow Manaphy can set up and find themselves rolling through a team, powerful Fire-types such as Victini and Entei are able to freely spam their V-creates and Sacred Fires without a second thought, and priority users such as Braviary and Skarmory can sweep teams with Brave Bird without worry.</p>"
      },
      "LeviTran": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume is like Scald in that it spreads burns very quickly, although unlike Scald, it's stopped cold by Flash Fire users. Flying-type and Fire-type spam are very common strategies in AAA, and Stealth Rock destroys both of them. Another cool thing about Heatran is that it pressures the most common Defogger in AAA, Skarmory, meaning that it typically does not get to Defog on Heatran. Earth Power has great synergy with Lava Plume, and it also ensures that Heatran doesn't provide a free switch opportunity for Fire-types. Flash Cannon is another option that can hit Rock- and Fairy-types super effectively and gets a STAB boost, although Fairy-types are rarely seen and Earth Power dents Rock-types already. Roar makes sure Heatran does not become fodder for setup sweepers. It also racks up Stealth Rock damage and gives Heatran more opportunities to spread burns. However, if your team already has a reliable phazer, Will-O-Wisp is a nice option to spread burns more reliably. Finally, Taunt is an option for preventing opposing Pokemon from recovering, Defogging, or setting up their own Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Levitate allows Heatran to discard its terrible Ground weakness, and with it gone, Heatran can finally switch in to much of the physical metagame, such as Garchomp, while handling Gale Wings Skarmory with ease. Because Heatran does not have any reliable recovery, Leftovers is the preferred item so that it can slowly regain its health back.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be wary of Mold Breaker, as this allows Earthquake to hit Heatran. Also, be wary of Magic Bounce Pokemon, as they render half this set useless. Try not to let this Heatran variant take a Knock Off. Because Leftovers is its only form of recovery, Heatran tends to faint very quickly once its Leftovers is gone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Heatran suffers from lack of recovery, it's generally a good idea to have teammates that increase Heatran's longevity as much as possible. Wish support from Vaporeon and Chansey is very helpful due to Heatran's tendency to get worn down quickly, while entry hazard control pokemon such as Zapdos and Skarmory greatly increase Heatran's longevity. In terms of actual teammates, the classic Venusaur + Heatran core is very effective, with powerful Ground-type attacks no longer decimating the core. However, it is advised to have another Flash Fire user to compensate for Heatran's loss of Flash Fire. RegenVest Goodra is another nice partner for Heatran. It can take most of the special attacks aimed at Heatran, while Heatran can take many physical attacks and sometimes special Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks aimed at Goodra.</p>"

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash can check most of the Almost Any Ability metagame very well due to its good bulk and defensive typing, which allow it to resist common forms of priority and check every priority move user except Entei. Its main niche in the tier is as a mixed attacker, and it fills the role well. It sets itself apart from Doublade by being able to hold an item other than Eviolite, such as Leftovers.</p> <p>However, Aegislash is outclassed by Doublade in most other areas due to its inability to effectively run an ability other than Stance Change. It's fairly slow as well, although that can be used as an advantage, as it can avoid taking a hit in its much frailer Blade forme. Also, Aegislash can get worn down throughout the match due to its lack of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, which the opponent can always remove with Knock Off. Aegislash also relies on mind games with King's Shield to succeed, which means it is vulnerable to being outpredicted.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aegislash can use a Swords Dance set with three attacks, but it faces competition from Doublade due to the latter being free to run a better ability. Aegislash, however, has a lot of raw initial power as a result of its investment in Attack and is able to beat Mandibuzz with Head Smash. Similarly, a Swords Dance set with King's Shield can be used, but it is fairly subpar due to Aegislash's need to set up right away, and again, it faces competition from Doublade. A Substitute + Toxic set with Prankster can be frustrating to take down; however, it has a hard time against Pokemon with Magic Bounce due to Aegislash's inability to deal any meaningful damage without Stance Change. Head Smash can be used to get around Mandibuzz, but it deals huge recoil, which is an issue considering Aegislash's less-than-stellar HP, and it isn't very useful anywhere else. Choice Band or Choice Specs seems like a good option on paper because it lets Aegislash hit ridiculously hard. However, it isn't viable because Aegislash has to switch out very frequently to regain Shield forme after firing off an attack, making it extremely susceptible to entry hazard damage. A mixed set with four attacks running Life Orb and Speed investment can be used to overwhelm Aegislash's conventional counters with sheer power. However, this Aegislash variant doesn't last very long due to Life Orb recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran and Moltres can switch in on most of Aegislash's attacks and KO it with Fire Blast; however, they all have a very hard time switching in safely.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Mandibuzz can switch into and cripple Aegislash. Tyranitar can outright KO it with Crunch or use Pursuit should Aegislash attempt to switch out. Mandibuzz, especially with Poison Heal, can easily wall Aegislash and cripple it with its STAB Knock Off, removing its only form of recovery. However, Mandibuzz loses to Head Smash variants.</p> <p><strong>Poison Heal Users</strong>: The only Poison Heal user Aegislash can counter is Snorlax. The other ones can safely switch in on Aegislash and start setting up, as most of them can take at least one hit from Aegislash and activate their Toxic Orb.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus, Landorus-T, and Rhyperior can easily cripple Aegislash heavily with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Bulletproof Users</strong>: While rare, Pokemon with Bulletproof, such as Gliscor and Scizor, are immune to Shadow Ball, aren't hit too hard by Flash Cannon, and can easily set up and KO Aegislash with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest Users</strong>: Pokemon with Regenerator that often have an Assault Vest, such as Meloetta, can easily switch into every move on Aegislash's mixed set and cripple it with Knock Off, removing its Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon that Aegislash could normally counter can carry moves to lure and cripple it. Examples include Heracross with Knock Off and Shaymin-S with Earth Power.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball gives Aegislash a good, powerful STAB move that hits most threats neutrally and for good damage. King's Shield allows Aegislash to regain its very good defenses and provides it with an extra turn of Leftovers recovery. Flash Cannon can be used over King's Shield to check Fairy-types, but Shadow Ball usually does enough damage. Shadow Sneak picks off weakened foes and is useful for its priority. Finally, Sacred Sword hits the Dark- and Normal-types that will switch in on Aegislash's Ghost-type moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack gives Aegislash as much power as possible, while maximum HP adds a significant amount of bulk. A Quiet nature is used to boost the power of Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon if it is used, and 0 Speed IVs allow Aegislash to underspeed the majority of the metagame and take hits in Shield forme. Leftovers is the item of choice for more durability, which is one of Aegislash's advantages over Doublade, and allows Aegislash to tank more hits while in Shield forme. Weakness Policy is an alternative that takes advantage of Aegislash going last and taking hits in Shield forme by giving a huge boost to its attacking stats if it's hit with a super effective move. However, this means Aegislash will go down much quicker, effectively eliminating one of its main advantages over Doublade. An alternate spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 SpA allows Aegislash to hit harder with Sacred Sword and Shadow Sneak but decreases Aegislash's bulk significantly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aegislash is best used as a pivot, as it is able to switch in on moves that it resists and fire off strong hits in return. It can also be used as a late-game cleaner due to its high attacking stats. To get Aegislash in safely, bring it in on resisted hits, on passive walls, or with the use of a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Try to use King's Shield cautiously, as the opponent will very easily catch on and play around Aegislash. If it is needed to check something, make sure Aegislash isn't worn down too much, as the Pokemon it can check are all very powerful. It can wallbreak reasonably well, as it has a lot of raw power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its unique properties, Aegislash fits best on balanced teams that can make use of both its offensive and defensive capabilities. Goodra and Latios can counter special Fire-types such as Moltres. They can also weaken the opposition for Aegislash, enabling it to come in and clean up, while Aegislash can switch in on the Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves that they detest. Strong and fast attackers such as Shaymin-S, Latios, Victini, and Tornadus-T are very helpful, as they soften up Aegislash's potential switch-ins, such as RegenVest users like Goodra and Meloetta, while also luring in priority move users such as Lucario, Genesect, Braviary, and Staraptor, giving Aegislash a free opportunity to switch in. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S, whose blistering Speed makes it all but guaranteed to set up entry hazards, and Ferrothorn, which, due to having Flash Fire, is able to counter problematic Fire-types such as Victini and Moltres or at least cripple them with Knock Off, allowing Aegislash to secure OHKOs on important threats such as Chansey. In turn, Aegislash can block Rapid Spin, keeping entry hazards up. Even though Aegislash is immune to Toxic Spikes and has a Stealth Rock resistance, it appreciates entry hazard removal, as the residual damage can offset Leftovers recovery; therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, either with Defog or with Rapid Spin, such as Latias, which can switch in on Ground-type moves, and Tentacruel and Mega Blastoise, which can reliably switch in on Fire-type moves, work well with Aegislash. Wish passers such as Chansey and Vaporeon can keep Aegislash healthy with Wish and Heal Bell. Because Aegislash can counter Poison Heal Snorlax, Pokemon that are countered by Snorlax, such as Genesect and Shaymin-S, make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Alakazam possesses a blazing Speed stat that allows it to outspeed the likes of Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Its Speed combined with high Special Attack and a good movepool allows Alakazam to revenge kill well and act as a late-game sweeper. However, its Psychic typing does not provide it with the best STAB move and leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit trapping. Additionally, its weak defenses leave it susceptible to being revenge killed by priority or Choice Scarf foes. Alakazam also faces competition from other Sheer Force threats like Gengar, Azelf, and Thundurus-T. Azelf has a niche over Alakazam due to its usable Attack stat, allowing it to run mixed sets, though Alakazam is faster and has higher Special Attack. Overall, Alakazam is a strong threat that outspeeds and overpowers much of the AAA metagame, giving it a great matchup against offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Download or Competitive can be used with Alakazite to get a strong and fast Mega Evolution with a immediate boost on a switch in. Signal Beam is an option that hits Bulletproof Dark-types, but it fails to OHKO Tyranitar. Substitute can be used when predicting a foe's switch out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>RegenVest Users</strong>: RegenVest Meloetta easily takes any of Alakazam's moves and can either OHKO it with Knock Off or get momentum with U-turn. Escavalier, Scizor, Goodra, and Genesect can all switch into Alakazam if it is not running Fire Punch. Escavalier and Scizor can then Pursuit trap Alakazam, ensuring it will be OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Special Defensive Walls</strong>: Regenerator, Magic Bounce, or Unaware Chansey and Poison Heal Mandibuzz are examples of Pokemon that can switch in and take on Alakazam. Chansey can stall it out with Seismic Toss and Wish, and Mandibuzz immediately threatens Alakazam with Knock Off and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Extreme Speed users like Lucario and Entei and Gale Wings users like Skarmory and Braviary easily revenge kill Alakazam, and Skarmory can even switch into a Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: When holding a Choice Scarf, Pokemon like Victini or Krookodile can outspeed and OHKO Alakazam, and Krookodile can even Pursuit traps it.</p> <p><strong>Bulletproof Users</strong>: With immunities to Focus Blast, Energy Ball, and Psychic, Bulletproof Dark-types are rare but serious threats to Alakazam. Bulletproof Tyranitar will Pursuit trap Alakazam, while Bulletproof Choice Scarf Krookodile will outspeed and also Pursuit trap it. Bulletproof Ferrothorn and Excadrill are less common but still pose a threat due to their immunities and resistances to Psychic.</p>",

      "Sheer Force Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic provides Alakazam with a powerful Sheer Force-boosted STAB move that can OHKO many threats in the metagame, such as Thundurus and even a physically defensive Zapdos after prior Stealth Rock damage. Focus Blast hits Dark- and Steel-type foes that can switch into Psychic, such as Tyranitar and Ferrothorn. Shadow Ball hits Psychic- and Ghost-type foes such as Latios and Doublade, OHKOing both of them. Energy Ball is a coverage move for threats like Manaphy and Suicune, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter if it doesn't have a Calm Mind boost up. Encore is an option that shuts down foes that will attempt to set up, most notably Suicune. It also forces out Poison Heal users that rely on Protect to recover their health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>EVs are set to maximize Speed and Special Attack. A Timid nature lets Alakazam outspeed much of the metagame, most notably Choice Scarf Tyranitar's Pursuit. Sheer Force boosts the power of each of Alakazam's moves. Life Orb works perfectly with Sheer Force by increasing Alakazam's damage output without the recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alakazam can be used efficiently as a revenge killer, unless the foe has a Choice Scarf or strong priority. You should utilize Volt Switch or U-turn to get Alakazam safely into play, as Alakazam's poor defenses prevent it from being able to switch into attacks. Entry hazards limit the foe's opportunities to switch in even more. This is especially helpful against checks like RegenVest Goodra and Manaphy if Energy Ball is foregone. You must beware of Pursuit threats such as Escavalier and Scizor, as they are not taken down by Focus Blast. You should also be cautious of priority users such as Gale Wings Braviary and Extreme Speed Entei, as they revenge kill Alakazam. Lastly, Alakazam should only be sent out knowing it will be able to KO the foe, as it is unlikely that it will survive an attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magnet Pull users such as Infernape and Ampharos can remove RegenVest Escavalier and Scizor from play, both of which would otherwise Pursuit trap Alakazam. These two also provide U-turn and Volt Switch support. Strong physical attackers like Lucario and Heracross are recommended to beat special walls like Chansey. Additionally, Pursuit users such as Adaptability Tyranitar can trap counters like Mew and Meloetta. Normalize Gengar with Mean Look and Skill Swap can trap and beat similar counters like Chansey and Meloetta. Sheer Force Gengar has nearly identical counters as Alakazam, making Normalize Gengar a great lure. A counter to Gale Wings and -ate Extreme Speed users is necessary; Doublade and Skarmory fill this role well. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Chesnaught offer entry hazard support, making it easier for Alakazam to sweep. Flash Fire Forretress is a great teammate, as it tanks most physical hits and provides Rapid Spin and Volt Switch support. Additionally, it can check many priority users and can provide hazard support of its own. A mixed Genesect set has good synergy with Alakazam, as it can lure in threats like Manaphy and Meloetta, and it can pivot into Alakazam with U-turn to either give it a good matchup or provide solid damage to a main check. Additionally, Flamethrower can take out common Alakazam counters.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Combined with Eviolite, Chansey's unfathomable Special Defense and HP allow her to wall some of the most powerful special attackers in the metagame. Eviolite bolsters Chansey's physical bulk to be quite good—comparable to that of the likes of Donphan—which truly separates her from Blissey and allows her to check Psyshock attackers such as Life Orb Adaptability Latias. Additionally, Chansey's grand HP stat generates very large Wishes, fundamentally allowing her to completely revitalize allies. As Chansey can switch in against many threats, she often receives opportunities to use Wish or Heal Bell and fulfill her role as an excellent cleric. Chansey's Normal typing grants her one immunity but also one weakness; however, Fighting-type attacks are very uncommon among special attackers, so it's a good typing for a special wall. Chansey's positive defensive qualities have made her a staple on stall teams; however, Chansey also has a few flaws dragging her down. Her terrible attacking stats limit her sources of damage to just Skill Swap (against Poison Heal Pokemon), Seismic Toss, and Toxic. As Chansey relies on her Eviolite to wall foes, Knock Off and Trick from the likes of Mew and Latios, as well as many other threats, can water down Chansey's walling ability for the rest of the match. Chansey is slow, and her only attacking move is Seismic Toss, so she's very vulnerable to Taunt, unless she is using Magic Bounce. Chansey is also very one-dimensionsal and extremely predictable; thus, it's easy for the opponent to bait a switch and gain free momentum against Chansey. However, even with these flaws, Chansey's ability to single-handedly check some of the metagame's most powerful special attackers, such as Mega Diancie, has made her the most pivotal wall for stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Fire Chansey is not vulnerable to Magnet Pull Pokemon, unlike most Flash Fire users, and she can wall some of the hardest-hitting Fire-types in the metagame, namely Entei, Heatran, and some Victini. Thunder Wave cripples a Pokemon's Speed, but it is generally ineffective against wallbreakers and sweepers; additionally, Magic Bounce and Poison Heal are commonly used abilities, consequently limiting Thunder Wave's usefulness. Intimidate allows Chansey to wall strong physical attackers, but even with Intimidate, Chansey still does not function well as a physical wall. With Chansey's high HP, Counter can easily net KOs against physical attackers, but Chansey's other moves are more useful overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Knock Off users, such as Tornadus-T and Azelf, can remove Chansey's precious Eviolite to greatly lower her walling ability.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Chansey is one of the only counters to certain attackers such as Hydreigon, but because of her lack of Leftovers recovery, she is prone to being worn down, especially with entry hazards up.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: If Chansey is not using Magic Bounce, Taunt users such as Gengar and Heatran severely shut down her options, which leaves her as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users</strong>: Latios and Chandelure can severely cripple Chansey by Tricking her a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pangoro, Blaziken, and Lucario are able to hit Chansey with STAB super effective moves against her weaker Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types—particularly those that are immune to poison, such as Doublade and Gengar—are unaffected by Chansey's attacks and can use her as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon that do not mind Seismic Toss, such as Doublade, Latias, Skarmory, and Poison Heal Pokemon, can use Chansey as setup bait; however, if Skill Swap is being used, Chansey will be able to lessen certain foes' damage outputs and hurt Poison Heal Pokemon, and if Toxic is used, it can whittle down sweepers such as Sheer Force Manaphy and Latios.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle</strong>: Gothitelle can trap Chansey with Shadow Tag and Trick her a Choice item, debilitating her for the rest of the match. The opponent may choose to KO her through PP stalling with Gothitelle's Rest or bring in another Pokemon to use Chansey as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon with Substitute, such as Gengar, are unaffected by Chansey's Seismic Toss and can use Chansey as setup bait. Additionally, Chansey cannot poison Pokemon behind a Substitute, and if a Substitute user has a maximum HP of 404 or higher, Seismic Toss will fail to break its Substitute in one hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Ms. Stall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Soft-Boiled grants Chansey instant recovery and the ability to wall all kinds of attackers. Wish grants another choice of recovery and can completely revitalize allies through Wish-passing. Seismic Toss allows Chansey to act while Taunted, deal consistent damage, and break Substitutes from Pokemon with less than 404 HP in one hit. Heal Bell, a must-have for any stall team, removes the party's status ailments, while Skill Swap lets Chansey defeat Pokemon with Poison Heal, use Toxic on Magic Bounce and Magic Guard Pokemon, weaken Adaptability Pokemon, and more; however, it is not recommended to use Skill Swap with Regenerator, as that would allow the foe to recover HP by switching. Toxic allows Chansey to whittle away at the HP of dangerous threats, such as Latios and Manaphy, but is ineffective against Poison Heal Pokemon and, particularly, Magic Bounce Pokemon, as they can bounce Toxic back onto Chansey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chansey's EV spread maximizes her physical bulk to take on all kinds of threats, particularly those that take advantage of her lower Defense stat, while Eviolite augments Chansey's Defense and Special Defense by 1.5x. Magic Bounce lets Chansey bounce Taunt, entry hazards, and crippling status moves back onto the opposition; however, Pokemon with Mold Breaker can bypass Magic Bounce and use status moves. Regenerator augments Chansey's longevity and increases her viability as a consistent switch-in to offensive threats. Unaware allows Chansey to counter stat-boosting threats such as Manaphy and Nasty Plot Mew. Bear in mind that, even with Unaware, Chansey still struggles against physical setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados and Dragonite. An alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD is also good, as it increases Chansey's special bulk to optimize her matchup against special attackers, at the cost of worse physical bulk and less-potent Wishes; however, because the metagame is overrun by physical attackers and Pokemon with Psyshock, the main spread is still the most reliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chansey's main role is to wall special attackers. Early-game, it's important to remain reserved with Chansey's use. Constant switching without some prior scouting may risk Chansey's Eviolite being removed by Knock Off or Trick, and Chansey's lack of Leftovers leaves her more vulnerable to damage from sand, status ailments, and entry hazards. Pokemon with, at the least, 101-HP Substitutes, such as Manaphy, can set up against Chansey, paying no heed to her Seismic Toss. Skill Swap allows Chansey to defeat Poison Heal Pokemon, including those with Substitute. Additionally, Skill Swap allows Chansey to beat Sheer Force Gengar one-on-one, as the lack of Sheer Force weakens Gengar's attacks and forces it to take Life Orb recoil. After Chansey uses Wish, the opponent might predict the recipient, so tread carefully and study the opponent's tendencies while Wish-passing. As Whirlwind and Roar are unaffected by Protect, opponents might try to prevent Chansey from healing herself with Wish; however, with Magic Bounce or Regenerator, Chansey is relatively safe against this strategy. If Protect is used, use it to Toxic stall as well as scout mixed attackers and users of Trick or Knock Off; the latter point is most important, as Chansey relies on her Eviolite to effectively wall foes. Constant use of Wish may be used as a fail-safe strategy against opponents with a strong wallbreaker. For example, if a wallbreaker or sweeper that Chansey cannot wall is on the field and Wish has already been used, the Wish should be passed to a teammate, which effectively provides a safe switch in for the recipient. Pursuit trappers, namely Adaptability Tyranitar, can trap Chansey with Pursuit and greatly damage her; therefore, it's important to remain cautious against Pokemon with Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical walls such as Doublade, Regirock, and Diancie appreciate Chansey's Wish-passing and can take strong physical attacks aimed at Chansey, while Chansey can take strong special attacks aimed at them. Additionally, Intimidate Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Chesnaught are extremely bulky and capable of walling a large portion of physical attackers. If Chansey lacks Heal Bell, Regenerator Diancie and Mew are good teammates, as they can both provide Heal Bell support. Even if Chansey has Magic Bounce, she does not excel at bouncing back entry hazards; consequently, spinners such as Blastoise or Defoggers such as Mandibuzz are obligatory teammates. Chansey excels at shutting down offensive threats and forcing switches, so users of Spikes and Stealth Rock, such as Deoxys-D and Ferrothorn, appreciate Chansey's Wish-passing and can set entry hazards to wear down foes. Pokemon with Roar help Chansey by phazing Substitute Pokemon and boosting sweepers, but this strategy will fail against Magic Bounce Pokemon. If Unaware is not used, Unaware walls such as Cresselia should be used to wall boosting sweepers, including those with Substitute. A Mega Evolution such as Mega Diancie can take a Knock Off or Trick aimed at Chansey, in order to preserve her Eviolite. Bulky setup Pokemon, such as Manaphy and Dragonite, appreciate Chansey's Wish-passing, as Wish can be used to keep them healthy. Chansey walls almost all special attackers, but Manaphy, Gengar, and Latios, in particular, give her trouble. For this reason, RegenVest variants of Goodra and Meloetta can be used to wall most Manaphy sets and check Adaptability Latios, respectively, and both are solid counters against Sheer Force Gengar.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Snorlax can be considered one of the most predictable Pokemon in the metagame, with almost every set being a CurseLax variant. Even with this disadvantage, Snorlax can still be utilized as a fantastic wincon as well as a wallbreaker that always moves last. With both an amazing HP and Special Defense stat as well as its lone weakness to Fighting, Snorlax can set up Curses on a large portion of special and physical attackers. Its main setup move, Curse, helps it boost its lackluster Defense, making it almost unbreakable after only a couple uses. Its main ability is Poison Heal, giving Snorlax excellent passive recovery as well as boosting Facade to a 140-Base Power STAB move. Poison Heal also gives it the ability to become an excellent status absorber after Toxic Orb activates. Although this Pokemon can be walled by a lot of common walls like Doublade and Skarmory, it's certainly one that is hard to pass up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to the effectiveness of the CurseLax set, Snorlax does not have many other sets that can compete with it. Whirlwind can be used over a coverage move or possibly Protect to phaze opposing setup Pokemon or deal chip damage with the help of entry hazards. A RegenVest set allows Snorlax to tank as many special attacks as possible and then fire off one of its great coverage moves. Snorlax can also run a more offensive EV spread, enabling it to beat Pokemon such as Suicune with ease.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types such as Tough Claws Heracross and Pangoro can OHKO Snorlax even through Curse at times.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon such as Skarmory and some variants of Heatran can take a hit from Snorlax and phaze it, preventing it from setting up. However, phazers are only a temporary answer and will likely lose in a one-on-one situation.</p> <p><strong>Doublade and Aegislash</strong>: Variants of Doublade and Aegislash that carry Sacred Sword can ignore Snorlax's Defense boosts and fire off a strong super effective attack, although they are threatened by Crunch or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Skill Swap or Worry Seed Users</strong>: Normalize Gengar or Worry Seed Ferrothorn can make Snorlax's Toxic Orb work against itself and force Snorlax to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Unaware Pokemon such as Suicune and Clefable can ignore Snorlax's boosts and set up on their own or phaze it, preventing a potential sweep.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Snorlax from setting up and stalling for extra recovery with Protect. However, it is usually luck reliant and has to be used in a one-on-one situation.</p>",

      "Poison Heal CurseLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Snorlax's access to Curse allows it to set up for a sweep and makes it almost unbreakable. Facade is Snorlax's spammable and very powerful move, especially with Poison Heal, hitting almost anything extremely hard. Protect is utilized to activate Toxic Orb upon switching in as well as to recover off damage received the turn prior. As a coverage move, Snorlax can run either Earthquake or Crunch. Earthquake is used more often, as it hits Rock- and Steel-types very hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Poison Heal gives Snorlax reliable recovery, restoring a solid 1/8 of its maximum health each turn. Being poisoned by Toxic Orb also lets it stand out as a physical attacker, not having to worry about other status ailments such as burn and paralysis, which would potentially cripple it. The given EVs and a Careful nature are used to maximize Snorlax's special bulk, making it very hard to break with those attacks. Investing the rest in Defense, in conjunction with Curse, helps it be physically bulky as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Snorlax provides the user with an excellent win condition. Thanks to its impressive bulk and its access to Curse, Snorlax works best as a mid- and late-game sweeper. Snorlax can set up on the majority of special attackers, being almost unbreakable for them, especially considering its reliable recovery in Poison Heal. Although it may look good on paper, using Protect at every opportunity may not be the best choice, as the foe can take advantage of it and get a free turn to set up entry hazards or boost its stats. Toxic Orb should be activated as soon as possible, and Snorlax should not switch in on a potential Knock Off or Trick before it activates, as losing its main source of recovery can cripple it completely. Lastly, try to get rid of phazers or Pokemon that wall it early-game and could stop a potential sweep, such as Skarmory, Aegislash, and Doublade.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snorlax partners well with Fire-types as well as Magnet Pull users such as Heatran, Victini, and Rotom-W, as these can get rid of Steel-types or Pokemon that wall Snorlax such as Skarmory and Doublade. Flying- or Ghost-types such as Zapdos, Aegislash, and Doublade are also great teammates with Snorlax, as they keep Fighting-types such as Heracross and Lucario at bay. Snorlax also benefits from hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D, as they help to wear down Pokemon that Snorlax has trouble with. Snorlax can fill a variety of roles within any playstyle, namely stall and balance, thanks to its impressive special bulk, as well as being a nice setup sweeper.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres is an excellent Pokemon thanks to its ability to fulfill many roles with both offensive and defensive sets. It has a very useful typing that allows it to check Steel-, Fairy-, Grass-, and Fighting-types quite well and two high-powered STAB moves backed up by decent coverage and excellent Special Attack. On the defensive side, Moltres comes with solid bulk and access to Will-O-Wisp, Defog, and Roost; it is also a very solid check to Shaymin-S, and it can pivot around foes with U-turn. However, Moltres has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock if not using Magic Guard and has a fair amount of competition from other Fire-types such as Heatran, which also fulfills multiple roles but does not come with a weakness to Stealth Rock and has a different set of resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A wallbreaking set using Desolate Land and Choice Specs is possible due to Moltres's extreme power under harsh sunlight and excellent coverage, but it has heavy competition from Heatran and requires very reliable entry hazard removal support. Offensive sets with Primordial Sea help to check Fire-types and give perfect accuracy to Hurricane, but they leave Moltres with a severe weakness to Stealth Rock; Moltres goes better with teammates that can set rain for it. Life Orb + Sheer Force boosts the power of both Hurricane and Fire Blast significantly, but again, it leaves Moltres severely weak to Stealth Rock and its Fire Blast is still weaker than Choice Specs Fire Blast under harsh sunlight. Hurricane can be used on Desolate Land sets, but it only has 50% accuracy under harsh sunlight. Flame Charge is a potential filler move on Moltres's offensive sets, but Moltres is still very vulnerable to priority moves. Toxic Orb is a possibility on defensive Moltres to avoid being put to sleep or paralyzed, but Leftovers is still the preferred item for extra recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Moltres can be easily OHKOed by Rock-type attackers such as Tyranitar and Diancie, and it must be careful predicting around them with Choice sets, as they resist both of its STAB attacks. However, most Rock-types lack recovery outside of the occasional Poison Heal, so offensive sets can eventually wear them down, especially if Moltres catches them with Grass-type coverage on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Dedicated special wallbreakers such as Latios and Gengar can OHKO offensive Moltres sets or break through defensive Moltres, while strong physical attackers such as Landorus fare better versus defensive sets thanks to its lower physical bulk. However, most strong attackers cannot switch into offensive sets or survive a Hurricane from Gale Wings Moltres, and physical attackers must be wary of switching into Will-O-Wisp from defensive Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock greatly reduces the longevity of non-Magic Guard sets, forcing Moltres to lose 50% of its health upon switching in.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although most Water-types are poor switch-ins to Hurricane, they are capable of pivoting into a Fire-type attack and KOing Moltres with their super effective STAB moves. Defensive Moltres is setup fodder for Water-types such as Manaphy and Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric and Raikou are easily capable of OHKOing Moltres and resist Hurricane, making them good checks to Gale Wings Moltres. Zapdos can take Hurricane or Air Slash from Moltres, although non-Primordial Sea variants cannot switch into Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Pokemon</strong>: Flash Fire users such as Doublade and Ferrothorn totally wall Moltres's defensive set and can pivot into offensive Moltres's Fire Blast to set up either Swords Dance or entry hazards on it. Flash Fire Landorus is also an excellent check, as it outspeeds Moltres and OHKOes with Stone Edge, although it cannot survive a Gale Wings Hurricane. Flash Fire Steel-types must also be wary of Moltres pivoting into a Magnet Pull teammate with U-turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is an incredibly strong priority STAB move backed by perfect accuracy under rain. Fire Blast hits Steel-types lacking Flash Fire or Primordial Sea that resist Hurricane, although it is weaker under rain. U-turn allows Moltres to pivot on predicted counters such as Diancie, and Hidden Power Water hits Rock-types that resist Moltres's STAB moves and has boosted power under rain. Sleep Talk can also be used to make Moltres a sleep absorber if its team lacks a decent check to sleep move users such as Breloom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature backed by Choice Specs allow Moltres to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment lets it outspeed as much as possible when not using Hurricane. Gale Wings gives Moltres priority on Hurricane so that it can KO faster foes such as Latios before they can attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Moltres should ideally be brought in under rain so that Hurricane has perfect accuracy and Hidden Power Water is boosted. Moltres is still usable out of the rain as a strong attacker; it should just be wary of Hurricane misses. Moltres is best used as a late-game cleaner, as there are simply too many common threats that can prevent it from effectively wallbreaking. Use Hurricane unless specifically predicting a bulky Pokemon that resists it and that will be hit harder by a coverage move to switch in. U-turn in conjunction with entry hazards and Pursuit or Magnet Pull support can help to wear down Flash Fire Steel-types that wall Moltres, so use it when predicting a counter to switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on rain teams, so Swift Swim sweepers such as Hoopa and Mega Swampert and rain setters such as Drizzle Zapdos and Rotom-W should be paired with Moltres. Lead rain-setting Deoxys-S is notable, as it provides both rain and entry hazard support to wear down foes, although other entry hazard setters are also appreciated. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as the aforementioned Zapdos and Latios is important to avoid having Moltres lose half of its health when switching in. Magic Bounce users such as Mew can also help with this. Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Magnet Pull users such as Suicune can be brought in after using U-turn to trap Moltres's counters.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast and Hurricane are Moltres's main STAB moves to hit Grass-, Fighting-, Steel-, and Bug-type foes, although Air Slash can be used to avoid missing Hurricane. Defog removes entry hazards to support Moltres's teammates, and Roost improves Moltres's longevity, allowing it to switch into weaker attackers multiple times. U-turn can be used to pivot out of predicted counters.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Guard prevents Moltres from taking damage from Stealth Rock as well as allowing it to use Life Orb without taking recoil. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment helps to outspeed foes and hit them as hard as possible. A Timid nature increases Moltres's Speed further, and it is used despite lowering the power of U-turn, which is used primarily for pivoting purposes and is still weak without an Attack-decreasing nature. Life Orb increases Moltres's power without any drawback.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Attempt to use free turns to remove entry hazards with Defog, but be careful of Defiant users predicting it and getting a free Attack boost from Moltres. Hurricane is Moltres's safest attack to use, as Fire Blast can provide a free switch in for Flash Fire foes. Use U-turn when predicting counters to come in to rack up damage more quickly. If relying on Moltres to check offensive threats such as Lucario, keep it at a high amount of health with Roost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Moltres should be used with teammates that require Stealth Rock removed to be effective, such as Charizard and Staraptor. Electric- and Water-type checks such as Ferrothorn and Breloom are useful to cover Moltres's main weaknesses. Moltres also appreciates bulky teammates such as Diancie and Skarmory to fall back on when forced out by faster Pokemon or users of priority attacks such as Latios and Braviary. Gale Wings sweepers such as Honchkrow and Staraptor appreciate the entry hazard support as well as Moltres's wallbreaking support; however, they do stack weaknesses to Electric and Rock. Pursuit trappers and Magnet Pull users such as Honchkrow and Manectric help to weaken or eliminate Moltres's checks and counters.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp helps Moltres cripple foes and dissuade physically offensive Pokemon such as Tyranitar from switching in. Roost allows Moltres to recover off damage, while Defog removes entry hazards for its teammates. Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move to give Moltres some offensive presence, although Air Slash can be used to not be hard-walled by Flash Fire users such as Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Guard allows Moltres to avoid taking damage from Stealth Rock, making it much more effective at removing it with Defog. The HP and Defense EVs allow Moltres to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Tough Claws Lucario's Close Combat, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to more reliably take on most special attackers in general. Leftovers provides extra passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Moltres can only take on certain strong attackers such as Lucario if it is at a sufficient amount of HP, so keep it healthy by using Roost frequently. Using Will-O-Wisp a lot is a good way to wear down opposing teams by spreading burns, and in particular it helps to wear down Primordial Sea switch-ins. Use free turns to remove entry hazards with Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Dragonite and Multiscale users such as Altaria appreciate Moltres's entry hazard removal. Electric- and Water-type checks such as Motor Drive Manaphy and Volt Absorb Slowbro are appreciated, as these two types of Pokemon can easily switch into Moltres. Pokemon that can switch into Rock-type moves such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught are also appreciated, although most Pokemon carrying Rock-type coverage cannot safely switch into Moltres due to Will-O-Wisp. Moltres can be set up on by Dragon-types such as Latios and Mega Charizard X, so teammates such as Ferrothorn and Unaware Suicune are useful. Frail setup sweepers like Lucario appreciate Moltres's ability to spread burns to provide more setup opportunities.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Heracross possesses a great Attack stat, making it one of the best physical attackers in the metagame. With its fantastic offensive typing, two very strong STAB moves in Megahorn and Close Combat, and access to coverage moves such as Stone Edge and Knock Off, it can be extremely hard to switch into. Due to its wallbreaking capability, Heracross has an excellent matchup against more defensive teams. Although Heracross's typing is amazing offensively, it isn't great defensively. Heracross's huge weakness to Gale Wings and Pixilate users such as Staraptor, Lucario, and Entei really hurts it, especially due to how common these Pokemon are. It can also be considered one of the most predictable Pokemon, usually running a Tough Claws set. Lastly, it has a lackluster Speed stat and mediocre bulk, which means it has a hard time performing well against more offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band could be used, but Heracross usually needs to be able to switch to a coverage move on a non-Choice Scarf set, so it might not be the best option. Mega Heracross could be used with Illusion, Download, or Magic Bounce as its first ability, but Life Orb Heracross usually outdamages its Mega Evolution, making it a better stallbreaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Gale Wings users such as Skarmory, Staraptor, and Braviary can threaten out Heracross at any time with their Flying-type priority moves. Other priority users such as Pixilate Lucario and Entei can OHKO Heracross as well.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Staraptor, Honchkrow, and Skarmory can all KO Heracross easily with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Intimidate users such as Hippowdon, Zapdos, and Skarmory are excellent checks to Heracross due to Intimidate coupled with their great physical bulk and typing.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Victini, Latios, and Gengar can easily come in on a Choice-locked Heracross and KO it with any of their STAB moves due to how low Heracross's defenses are.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Physically defensive Fairies such as Clefable and Sylveon can come in on any attack Heracross has to offer and threaten it out with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Megahorn and Close Combat are Heracross's two strongest STAB moves and receive a boost from Tough Claws, heavily denting even walls that resist them. Knock Off hits incoming Flying- or Ghost-types such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Doublade, crippling them by removing their item. Swords Dance boosts Heracross's Attack to massive levels, further augmenting its power in conjunction with Life Orb and Tough Claws. Although it isn't boosted by Tough Claws, Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types, most notably Zapdos. Facade can be used in case Heracross gets burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, giving it a very strong Normal-type move for neutral coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Heracross a nice boost to its power and lets it switch to any of its great coverage moves at any time. Lum Berry is a nice alternative that gives Heracross a one-time immunity to status ailments from the likes of Mew and Breloom. An Adamant nature with maximum investment in Attack and Speed allows Heracross to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding as many Pokemon as possible. Tough Claws gives a boost to all of Heracross's contact moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heracross should be used as a wallbreaker due to its insane Attack stat in conjunction with Tough Claws. Try to always keep entry hazards off the field, as the Life Orb recoil already wears down Heracross relatively quickly. Never keep Heracross in on potential Gale Wings users such as Skarmory and Braviary, as it will instantly get KOed due to its 4x weakness to Flying-type moves. Using one of Heracross's main strong STAB moves may not always be the best idea depending on the team matchup. If the opponent has an obvious switch-in, it might be wise to choose Knock Off to cripple the foe. Never switch Heracross in directly, as its lackluster defenses will force it to take a ton of damage even from a resisted attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heracross really appreciates Pokemon that resist Flying-type attacks such as Aegislash and Doublade, as they can combat Gale Wings users. It can also benefit from having bulky Intimidate users such as Hippowdon and Zapdos to handle Flying-types. Sweepers and cleaners such as Lucario and Staraptor appreciate Heracross's ability to break down defensive cores. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-D and Deoxys-S make Heracross's job as a wallbreaker a bit easier. Conversely, entry hazard removers such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz prevent Heracross from being worn down as easily. Wish passers such as Umbreon and Vaporeon can keep Heracross healthy and give it a free switch with Baton Pass. Bulky Flash Fire users such as Heatran and Doublade can take on Fire-types; in addition, these two can switch into Refrigerate and Pixilate users such as Victini, Entei, and Lucario. Lastly, Heracross also appreciates the help of Electric-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus, as they can take on Pokemon that Heracross has trouble with like Suicune and Skarmory.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat and Megahorn are Heracross's best STAB moves, hitting even Pokemon that resist it very hard coupled with Tough Claws. Knock Off is used to cripple incoming switch-ins such as Intimidate users like Zapdos and Mandibuzz. Either Stone Edge or Earthquake can be used for the last slot; although they aren't boosted by Tough Claws, they're still very strong and useful coverage moves, with Stone Edge hitting Flying-types and Earthquake hitting Poison-types, neither of which Heracross's STAB moves can hit effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Heracross to become an effective revenge killer and cleaner if the opponent's team is weakened. Tough Claws gives all of Heracross's contact moves, including its main STAB moves, a nice boost. Tinted Lens is a great alternative to hit common switch-ins very hard without having to predict at all. Lastly, a Jolly nature and maximum investment in Speed and Attack allow Heracross to outpace as many threats as possible while maximizing its damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Heracross becomes a reliable revenge killer, so it should be used as one once a teammate faints. Never keep Heracross in on potential Gale Wings users such as Skarmory and Braviary, as it will be instantly OHKOed. Try to keep Heracross for the late-game, as it's also a great cleaner when equipped with Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D are great teammates for Heracross, as extra damage on the foe makes the job easier for any cleaner. Switch-ins to Flying-type moves such as Aegislash and Doublade are also great teammates, as any Gale Wings user will OHKO Heracross before it can move. Wish passers such as Vaporeon and Umbreon can keep Heracross healthy for the late-game even if entry hazards are on the field. Bulky Flash Fire users such as Heatran and Doublade can take on Fire-types; additionally, these two can beat Refrigerate and Pixilate users such as Victini, Entei, and Lucario. Heracross also appreciates the help of Electric-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus, as they can take on physically bulky Pokemon that are troublesome to Heracross like Suicune and Skarmory.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>Sneasel is the fastest STAB Refrigerate user in the metagame, and this, combined with its passable Attack stat, makes it a solid offensive threat. Sneasel has excellent super effective coverage and high Base Power STAB moves, as well as strong priority that allows it to pick off Gale Wings users, giving it a great matchup versus offensive teams. However, Sneasel also suffers from poor bulk and a weakness to Stealth Rock, making it easy to wear down and difficult to switch in on even weak attackers. Sneasel is also easily stopped by most physical walls, particularly common bulky Water-types, which makes it much harder for it to perform versus bulkier teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Feint can be used over Quick Attack to attack before slower Extreme Speed users with its higher priority and to bypass the occasional Protect for extra pressure versus Wish users such as Chansey. However, most Extreme Speed users aside from Dragonite resist Ice anyway, and the power drop is notable. Double-Edge can be run over Return for a stronger STAB attack, but it can get Sneasel KOed very quickly with the combination of recoil, Life Orb, and Stealth Rock. Taunt can be run to cripple defensive switch-ins but is risky, as using it at the wrong time forces Sneasel to take a hit. Sneasel can run an Adaptability set as an alternate option to make up for its lower Base Power STAB attacks, exchanging a stronger Knock Off for weaker Ice-type STAB moves in Icicle Crash and Ice Shard. However, no abilities other than Refrigerate and Adaptability are viable, as Sneasel is reliant on the extra Attack boost to do satisfactory damage. Fake Out can also be run for strong, free chip damage, but Sneasel prefers having a priority move that is usable after its first turn out. Eviolite can be run over Life Orb to take one or two weaker attacks, such as uninvested Zapdos's Volt Switch, at the cost of making Sneasel's power somewhat underwhelming.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory and Mega Scizor</strong>: Physically defensive Skarmory can avoid the 3HKO from Sneasel's Return even after Stealth Rock and can proceed to set up entry hazards, Roost off the damage, or simply KO Sneasel with Brave Bird. Similarly, Mega Scizor can KO Sneasel with a priority Bullet Punch and takes little damage from any of Sneasel's attacks; it also has the added bonus of not being crippled by Knock Off. However, both can be trapped and KOed by Magnet Pull users such as Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Sneasel's frailty many Pokemon that outspeed it are capable of OHKOing it with little or no prior damage. This includes threats such as Mega Manectric and Crobat, weather sweepers with Chlorophyll or Swift Swim, and Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Genesect.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon not weak to one of Sneasel's STAB moves are typically capable of switching into and beating it 1v1. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Mega Gyarados fit this role well, as well as other Pokemon such as Umbreon and the aforementioned Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon with powerful or super effective priority moves, such as Bullet Punch Scizor and Pixilate or Tough Claws Extreme Speed users such as Lucario and Genesect, are capable of KOing Sneasel before it has the chance to attack. However, Sneasel can take on Shadow Sneak users, such as Doublade, and those that use Gale Wings for priority, such as Braviary, fairly easily due to its resistance to the former and ability to go for a faster Quick Attack against the latter, with Refrigerate Quick Attack being super effective on the most common users of Gale Wings.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "FREE WEAVILE": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Sneasel's main attacking move, with Refrigerate boosting its power and giving it a STAB bonus. Knock Off hits common Pokemon that resist Ice, such as Victini and Entei, as well as removing items from foes. Quick Attack gives Sneasel a boosted STAB priority move for picking off faster threats and other priority users. Swords Dance allows Sneasel to function as a late-game cleaner and helps it break through bulkier teams, while Low Kick is an option to lure in and 2HKO Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Pursuit can trap Pokemon weak to Dark, such as Victini, that Sneasel threatens out, but it comes at the cost of losing Swords Dance or Low Kick, making it harder to pull off late-game sweeps or hit Steel-types, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature utilize Sneasel's excellent Speed tier by allowing it to outspeed and OHKO common threats such as Latios, Gengar, and Thundurus, while maximum Attack investment allows Sneasel to hit as hard as possible. Life Orb further boosts Sneasel's Attack to give it even more power, but it comes at the cost of wearing down Sneasel quickly in conjunction with Stealth Rock. Refrigerate is the preferred ability to give Sneasel a higher Base Power Ice-type STAB move in Return, as well as a boosted priority move in Quick Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Knock Off should be used more often early-game, as it can remove items to cripple teams for the late-game. Use Return frequently versus teams lacking a Pokemon with recovery and a resistance to Ice, as its high Base Power can quickly wear down even bulky Pokemon that resist Ice. Thanks to its own Ice resistance, Sneasel is capable of revenge killing some Refrigerate Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Genesect, but it is imperative that you make sure these Pokemon actually have Refrigerate first, because Sneasel cannot survive a neutral or super effective Extreme Speed. If using Swords Dance, avoid setting up until late-game, as most teams will have at least one check capable of preventing a sweep. If running Low Kick, try to hit Steel-types on the switch, because most of them, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, are 2HKOed by it and can OHKO Sneasel in return. Make sure that Sneasel almost never directly switches into an attack, due to its poor bulk, and instead use double switches, free switches, and slow pivots to bring Sneasel in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electric-types such as Thundurus and Desolate Land Pokemon such as Victini are useful for taking on bulky Water-types, which Sneasel is incapable of breaking through. Magnet Pull users such as Heatran can also trap and remove Steel-types such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor, two of Sneasel's best counters. Entry hazard removers such as Mandibuzz and Skarmory help Sneasel stay around longer by removing Stealth Rock for it, and pivots such as Baton Pass Vaporeon and U-turn Genesect can get Sneasel free switches into the field to avoid having it take an attack. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Deoxys-D also benefit Sneasel by helping it wear down teams so that it can more easily sweep late-game. Shaymin-S is an excellent offensive partner for Sneasel, as it can break past bulky Water-types and outspeed some of the faster Pokemon that give Sneasel trouble, while Sneasel can lure Steel-types and KO Assault Vest users and special walls for Shaymin-S. Both, however, are threatened by common Choice Scarf or Extreme Speed users.</p>"

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Being one of the few Pokemon with access to both Brave Bird and Swords Dance, Skarmory is one of the best Gale Wings users in AAA. Possessing priority on Flying-type moves on its offensive set and considerable bulk on its defensive set in combination with a typing that provides it an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes as well as a neutrality to Stealth Rock, Skarmory is also arguably the best Defog user in the metagame. In addition, its fantastic defensive typing and Defense stat allow it to both wall most opposing Gale Wings users and use many commonly used Pokemon in the metagame as setup fodder, further increasing both its defensive and offensive prowess. As if these traits weren't enough, Skarmory's ability to run both defensive and offensive sets often means the opponent cannot discern Skarmory's role on Team Preview, allowing it to potentially surprise the opponent. However, Skarmory's low HP and Special Defense stats prevent it from standing up to most special attackers, and it is easily eliminated by Magnet Pull Pokemon if it opts not to run a Shed Shell. Its low Attack stat among Gale Wings users also leaves it relatively weak before boosting, meaning it faces competition from Braviary, Staraptor, and Honchkrow, all of which can deal lots of damage right off the bat using a Choice Band. Finally, Skarmory lacks meaningful coverage moves outside of its Flying-type STAB moves, meaning it is easily walled by any Pokemon that resists Flying and has a means of fighting back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Mold Breaker set with both Stealth Rock and Spikes is an option for offensive teams that want an entry hazard setter, but more often than not Deoxys-S does this job better. Magic Bounce can be run on Skarmory, but Skarmory is for the most part outclassed by other Magic Bounce users. Delta Stream removes Skarmory's Electric-type weakness and makes it resistant to Rock-type and Ice-type moves, though this change doesn't let it wall any additional notable Pokemon. Thick Fat is an alternative over Flash Fire that also makes Skarmory resistant to Ice, but Flash Fire is generally better because most Fire-type attackers can still break Skarmory if it runs Thick Fat. Tailwind is an option in the last slot on the Swords Dance set to support the team, but it is generally inferior to the utility of other moves. Finally, Toxic is an alternative to Brave Bird on the physically defensive set to spread status, but Skarmory becomes extremely passive when using the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon have no trouble at all switching into the Swords Dance set and can force Skarmory out with the threat of a powerful Volt Switch, conserving momentum while doing so.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Steel-types</strong>: While some of these Pokemon are setup fodder for Skarmory, Rock-types and Steel-types that can fight back such as Tyrantrum, Aegislash, Heatran, and Mega Metagross using Thunder Punch are all excellent checks to the Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Without its Swords Dance boost being felt, Skarmory's Brave Bird is rather underwhelming, meaning Unaware users have a rather easy time with the Swords Dance set. Suicune, Cresselia, and Skarmory itself are all common examples of prominent Unaware Pokemon that handle Skarmory with relative ease, though Cresselia and Skarmory must keep an eye out for Taunt variants.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers</strong>: While with Intimidate Skarmory is very physically bulky, some physical attackers such as Lucario, Heracross, and Tyrantrum are still too much for Skarmory to handle.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Skarmory cannot take many special attacks, meaning it usually runs at the sight of most strong special attackers with neutral coverage.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce and Taunt</strong>: Because Whirlwind cannot force out Pokemon with Magic Bounce, Skarmory's physically defensive set can at best use an uninvested Brave Bird to fight back against these Pokemon, making it far easier to eliminate. A well-timed Taunt from Pokemon such as Honchkrow and Haxorus has the same effect but also removes Roost from Skarmory's pool of options.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: If Skarmory doesn't run Shed Shell, Magnet Pull users such as Heatran and Rotom-W can easily dispose of it. It is important to note that said Pokemon must be able to take a Swords Dance-boosted Brave Bird to trap and KO the Swords Dance set, however.</p>",

      "Swords Dance Skarmory": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Skarmory's Attack stat, turning it into a dangerous offensive threat. Brave Bird gains priority due to Gale Wings, and when backed up by Swords Dance and potentially Sharp Beak, it allows Skarmory to sweep most teams after their answer to Gale Wings users has been taken care of. Roost allows Skarmory, with priority, to heal damage it takes both from the opposing Pokemon and from Brave Bird recoil. Given that due to its priority its secondary effect of removing Skarmory's Flying typing will always activate, it is, however, important to watch out for Ground-type and Fighting-type moves on the turn Roost is used. Priority Defog lets Skarmory remove entry hazards from the field extremely easily, given apart from opposing priority it will be impossible to prevent Skarmory from Defogging once it enters the field of play. It also allows Skarmory to get rid of dual screens. If hazard control is not needed or your own team is hazard centric, Whirlwind can be used over Defog to both accumulate hazard damage on Skarmory's counters and allow Skarmory to beat opposing Gale Wings Skarmory and Snorlax. It also allows Skarmory to defeat opposing Roar or Whirlwind Pokemon, as it's faster than most of them. Taunt shuts down Pokemon that cannot threaten Skarmory outside of status or setup moves, such as Doublade and opposing Skarmory, in addition to making it far more difficult for defensive teams to handle. Iron Head is another possible move in the final slot that allows Skarmory to get through Rock-types, but it does little other than that, making it generally inferior to the utility of the other options.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature with maximum Attack investment ensures Skarmory hits as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to increase Skarmory's physical bulk as much as possible in order to take on opposing Gale Wings users better, allow Skarmory to take more recoil, and afford it more setup opportunities. Gale Wings gives priority to Brave Bird, Roost, and Defog, allowing Skarmory to attack, heal, and remove entry hazards with priority. Sharp Beak increases Skarmory's damage output and thus both its sweeping and revenge killing capabilities. Shed Shell removes Skarmory's Magnet Pull weakness but wastes its item slot against teams lacking Magnet Pull. As a final option, Leftovers helps Skarmory with Brave Bird recoil and makes setting up easier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skarmory is mainly a setup sweeper, but it can function as a revenge killer as well given it is capable of forcing out Pokemon weak to Flying or with little physical bulk, Shaymin-S and Gengar being more popular examples. Weakened Pokemon are also vulnerable to revenge killing. Skarmory's other major role is countering opposing physical Gale Wings Pokemon such as Braviary and Honchkrow. Try to find Skarmory opportunities to set up against physical attackers that cannot threaten it, such as Regirock, or Pokemon that it forces out, such as the aforementioned Shaymin-S and Gengar. Due to its Toxic immunity, Skarmory can also set up on its fair share of walls, such as Chansey, which rely on Toxic to pose a threat. When removing entry hazards, make sure you have a way of dealing with potential Defiant and Competitive users that the opponent may have on their team to take advantage of Defog. Finally, do not let Skarmory get burned or risk taking a burn from moves such as Scald, as the residual damage and Attack drop caused by the status are extremely detrimental to Skarmory's walling and sweeping capabilities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types such as Garchomp or Pokemon with Motor Drive such as Manaphy are heavily recommended to help Skarmory deal with Electric-types that come in and force it out with Volt Switch, both countering it and gaining momentum in the process. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Ferrothorn greatly aids Skarmory's task, allowing it to revenge kill a far larger pool of Pokemon. It is, however, recommended to eschew using Defog with such partners, as it is counterproductive. Unaware Pokemon to take on Defiant and Competitive users when using Defog on Skarmory are excellent teammates, as they take almost all of the risk out of using Defog. Magnet Pull Pokemon such as Infernape and Heatran help remove Steel-types for Skarmory and therefore are great partners. Special sponges that can take special attacks aimed at Skarmory, such as Snorlax and Chansey, help alleviate Skarmory's low special bulk. Physical wallbreakers that lure in and KO Skarmory's counters, such as Heracross and Pangoro, work very well alongside Skarmory.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost provides Skarmory with reliable recovery and helps it prolong its stint on the battlefield. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze otherwise problematic sweepers and accumulate entry hazard damage if used alongside Spikes or Stealth Rock. Defog allows Skarmory to support the team with valuable entry hazard removal, though if it is not needed, Spikes lets Skarmory set entry hazards of its own and complements Whirlwind fairly nicely. Stealth Rock can also be used in this slot if your team lacks a Stealth Rock user, but it has a more widespread pool of users than Spikes does. Brave Bird means Skarmory can both act under Taunt and threaten Magic Bounce users, and it deals quite a bit of damage despite Skarmory's low Attack stat thanks to its high Base Power. Counter is an alternative to Brave Bird that gives Skarmory the ability to deal massive damage to physical attackers with correct prediction, but Skarmory is completely shut down by Taunt and Magic Bounce when using the move. Should Counter be run, Taunt is an option in the second slot to force physical attackers to attack Skarmory and shut down defensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Skarmory's EV spread and nature maximize its physical bulk, making it as sturdy of a physical wall as possible. A Bold nature is preferred over an Impish one when using Counter, however, as it minimizes damage from confusion and Foul Play. Intimidate increases Skarmory's physical bulk even further against Pokemon it switches into, making it that much more difficult to breach with physical attacks and allowing it to take on Pokemon it otherwise would not be able to wall such as Tough Claws Dragonite. Flash Fire is another viable ability that removes Skarmory's weakness to Fire, leaving it with a sole weakness to Electric-type moves and letting it handle attackers it otherwise would not be able to counter, such as Heatran, Entei, and Garchomp. Unaware on the other hand allows Skarmory to counter most physical sweepers, Swords Dance Doublade and Sneasel being common examples. Shed Shell removes Skarmory's Magnet Pull weakness, making it a more consistent wall overall despite losing out on an item slot against teams lacking Magnet Pull. For this reason, it is the recommended item on stall teams. Rocky Helmet accumulates considerable damage on physical attackers and U-turn Pokemon without Skarmory needing to devote any time to dishing it out, while Leftovers prolongs Skarmory's longevity and makes it more difficult to wear down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Skarmory functions as a physical wall for stall and balanced teams, shutting down some of the metagame's most prominent physical attackers. Watch out for Knock Off users if you're using Shed Shell and you know the opponent has a Pokemon with Magnet Pull, as without its Shed Shell, Skarmory will not be able to get into play without risking getting trapped and KOed. Try to keep Skarmory alive as long as the opponent has a Pokemon that can lay down entry hazards, as if Skarmory faints, said Pokemon will be able to set up its entry hazards for the remainder of the match. Finally, watch out for Magic Bounce Pokemon when using Spikes or Stealth Rock, as the opponent getting free entry hazards on your side of the field can be catastrophic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special walls such as Chansey, Goodra, and Meloetta perform excellently with Skarmory, as they can absorb special attacks targeted at Skarmory while Skarmory can take physical attacks aimed at them. If Skarmory is not using Flash Fire, other Pokemon resistant or immune to Fire such as Poison Heal Suicune and Flash Fire Doublade are ideal partners to take on Fire-type attackers that Skarmory cannot wall, such as Victini. Pokemon that benefit from entry hazard removal such as Victini and Braviary appreciate Skarmory's Defog support.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Latios is one of the most powerful Pokemon in the AAA metagame. With a great offensive and defensive typing in Dragon / Psychic, it can be almost impossible to switch into due to its access to powerful moves in Draco Meteor and Psyshock and power-boosting abilities in Adaptability and Tinted Lens to further complement its fantastic wallbreaking prowess. Not only is it one of the best wallbreakers in the metagame, but it also has the ability to sweep thanks to its access to Calm Mind and Roost coupled with a fantastic Speed tier to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame. However, due to its low Defense, Latios can usually be OHKOed by common priority users with Refrigerate or Gale Wings such as Entei, Thundurus, Skarmory, and Staraptor. Latios is also forced to switch out often due to the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor, so it can be trapped by potential Pursuit users such as Honchkrow and Mega Metagross.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs or Choice Scarf with Trick could be used to cripple some walls like Chansey while providing Latios a nice boost to its power or Speed. However, Latios doesn't necessarily need the power from Choice Specs, and Choice Scarf leaves it even more vulnerable to the myriad of priority users. An all-out attacker set with Primordial Sea as well as Surf and Thunder hits relatively hard and helps with some of its usual walls that Latios has trouble with such as Skarmory. Thunderbolt could be used as a coverage move to hit Pokemon like Skarmory very hard. Shadow Ball is also useable to hit Pokemon like Mega Metagross and Jirachi on the switch in. Lastly, Memento can help Latios avoid being Pursuit trapped and give setup opportunities to teammates with poor bulk, such as Lucario.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Refrigerate Entei as well as Gale Wings Braviary and Staraptor can take advantage of Latios's low Defense, forcing it to use Roost often to avoid being KOed.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Dark-types such as Greninja can threaten Latios with their strong STAB moves. Similarly, potential Pursuit users such as Mega Metagross and Honchkrow can take advantage of the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor and trap Latios.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Skarmory and Heatran resist both of Latios's STAB moves and thus wall it effectively, although a Tinted Lens set can surprise them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Thundurus and Heracross can take out Latios before it can move.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Togekiss, Diancie, and Florges are all immune to Latios's most powerful attack and can easily KO it with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is easily Latios's most spammable and powerful STAB move, especially when combined with Adaptability or Tinted Lens. Psyshock is Latios's preferred Psychic-type STAB move, hitting Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey on their weaker Defense. Roost provides Latios with reliable recovery, which is especially useful due to Life Orb recoil, further increasing its longevity. Calm Mind allows Latios to gain extra power if needed, which is really useful in a one-on-one situation against Calm Mind Suicune or a special wall such as Chansey. Alternatively, Defog can allow Latios to provide team support for teammates weak to Stealth Rock, such as Staraptor and Braviary.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature and maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allow Latios to Speed tie with other base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Gengar and Mega Diancie while hitting as hard as possible. Life Orb grants a nice, immediate boost to Latios's power. Adaptability gives an enormous boost to Draco Meteor and Psyshock, which easily turns some 2HKOs into OHKOs, most notably allowing Latios to OHKO Manaphy with Draco Meteor. Alternatively, Tinted Lens allows Latios to hit Steel-types very hard on the switch such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn, which are relatively common in the metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Draco Meteor might not always be the best move to use, especially considering that the Special Attack drop makes Latios vulnerable to Pursuit trappers. Latios can have a great matchup against any kind of playstyle due to the sheer power it provides, so try to keep it healthy for as long as possible. If using Tinted Lens, it's relatively easy to wear down Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Jirachi on the switch for teammates to clean them up late-game. If Latios is low on health and likely to force a switch, Roost will most likely be the best play. Try to never keep Latios in on Gale Wings users such as Braviary and Staraptor, as Brave Bird from either of them will easily OHKO Latios before it can move due to its lackluster physical bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-types such as Heatran, Landorus, and Lucario are helpful for disposing of Steel-types that resist Latios's STAB moves, but you must be wary of Flash Fire users if using Fire-types. Magnet Pull users such as Heatran and Magnezone can take out Steel-types as well. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D are useful for wearing down specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Snorlax for Latios. Weaker special attackers such as Gengar and Shaymin-S appreciate Latios's wallbreaking ability, as it makes their jobs easier late-game. Steel-types such as Doublade and Skarmory can take on the Refrigerate, Pixilate, and Gale Wings users that threaten Latios.</p>"

With its fantastic bulk comes an equally fantastic movepool sporting the likes of Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Spikes, all of which provide residual damage on the opposing team. It also has a niche over its other forme Deoxys-S because it can lay down more layers of hazards. Though Deoxys-D does have some great positives, it has very little offensive presence besides access to Knock Off, making it pretty easy to set up on. It's also susceptible to Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Gengar. Lastly, its typing is not that useful, as a large portion of the metagame can hit it for super effective damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unaware and Poison Heal sets are options if Deoxys-D needs to fill the role of a long-term entry hazard setter, but these are susceptible to Magic Bounce users and also struggle to carve a niche that Cresselia already covers really well. Magic Bounce is useful if an opponent is trying to get hazards up while Deoxys-D needs hazards of its own up. Thunder Wave is an option to cripple setup sweepers trying to set up with ease on Deoxys-D. Regenerator can allow it to keep hazards up throughout the game. Any kind of offensive set would be outclassed by other Psychic-types such as Latios and Mew.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Mew can easily shut down Deoxys-D completely by eliminating its role as an entry hazard setter.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Setup Sweepers</strong>: Opposing setup sweepers can take advantage of Deoxys-D's low attacking stats and put a relatively large dent in the team.</p> <p><strong>Priority Defog Users</strong>: Priority Defog users such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz can completely counter Deoxys-D's role by getting rid of entry hazards with ease. However, if Deoxys-D is running Prankster and Taunt, it beats these foes.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gengar and Aegislash threaten Deoxys-D with super effective attacks, though they are susceptible to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Honchkrow and Tyranitar can easily come in on Deoxys-D and threaten it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes and Stealth Rock support the team by wearing down foes upon them switching in. Taunt is used to prevent slower Defoggers such as Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Skarmory from using Defog. It's also used to prevent slower setup sweepers such as Suicune and Snorlax from taking advantage of Deoxys-D's low offensive presence, as well as to prevent opposing entry hazards from going up and even to stop slower Taunt users. Knock Off removes beneficial items such as Leftovers and Choice items. Skill Swap can be used in conjunction with Prankster, as it allows Deoxys-D to get past many Magic Bounce users such as Chansey and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Red Card phazes setup sweepers once they hit Deoxys-D. Leftovers is an option over Red Card to allow Deoxys-D to gain passive recovery while laying down entry hazards. Mold Breaker lets it lay down hazards without fear of Magic Bounce users such as Chansey and Zapdos bouncing them back. Prankster is an option over Mold Breaker to gain priority on hazards and other moves like Taunt, but it's usually not recommended given the prevalence of Magic Bounce Pokemon looking to bounce back hazards. Maximum HP and Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Deoxys-D to get as many as hazards up as possible while being as bulky as possible. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature should be used with Prankster, though, as it allows Deoxys-D to survive longer in the more physically oriented AAA metagame. Alternatively, you could run a more specially defensive EV spread to take on a plethora of special attackers in the metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to get as many entry hazards up as you can early-game to support Deoxys-D's teammates. Taunt slower Defoggers or entry hazard setters such as Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Ferrothorn. If you are running Prankster, try to use Skill Swap against potential Magic Bounce users, as if you don't, your own hazards will be bounced back. With Deoxys-D's high defenses, you can also pivot it into weaker attackers to get more hazards up later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ghost-types like Gengar, Doublade, and Aegislash, make for good teammates with Deoxys-D because they keep its entry hazards up against teams with spinners. Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel and Blastoise can remove opponents' hazards without removing your own. Defiant and Competitive users such as Metagross and Ampharos take advantage of opposing Defoggers, increasing their Attack and Special Attack stats, respectively. Sweepers and cleaners such as Lucario, Honchkrow, and Staraptor really appreciate the hazard support when going for a late-game clean or sweep.</p>"

It has access to Stealth Rock and Spikes and, thanks to its Speed, is often able to set Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes up. Deoxys-S also has access to Taunt, which helps it deal with other entry hazard setters and setup sweepers. Despite these helpful traits, however, Deoxys-S has a hard time setting up entry hazards against teams that rely mostly on priority, as priority moves can usually 2HKO Deoxys-S, preventing it from getting two entry hazards up. It has a good typing and good bulk for an entry hazard setter, and its mere presence in the Team Preview tends to draw out leads such as Gale Wings Skarmory and Choice Scarf Victini. This helps pick a lead, especially if Deoxys-S is not setting up entry hazards. It's a very predictable as a lead though, as it is almost always used in this role. Deoxys-S also has good offensive stats, which make it a good revenge killer along with its great Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Light Clay set with Reflect and Light Screen helps a teammate set up with ease. An offensive set with Adaptability and Life Orb, which has great coverage along with decent offensive stats, is good, as the Adaptability boost increases Psycho Boost's damage output. Focus Sash can be used as well on the entry hazard lead set with a Jolly nature in order to set up at least one entry hazard, even against faster Choice Scarf users. You can also try an offensive set with No Guard and Zap Cannon, Dynamic Punch, and Blizzard, as Electric / Fighting / Ice has perfect coverage, and Deoxys-S's Speed gives it a niche over Mew, allowing it to paralyze and cripple most faster threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Coat Users</strong>: Magic Coat users are able to get rid of Deoxys-S by blocking its attempts at setting up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with Prankster can Taunt the lead set, and Pokemon with strong priority attacks, as well as fast Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, can all outspeed and greatly damage Deoxys-S.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls</strong>: Bulky walls, particularly bulky Water-types, can check the Download set, provided that Deoxys-S lacks Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Poison Heal Spiritomb</strong>: Once its Toxic Orb is activated, Poison Heal Spiritomb is a great counter to the Download set.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor is an excellent counter due to its ability to counter the Download set as well as pressure the entry hazard setting set with Knock Off + Bullet Punch or U-turn. It can also get rid of the entry hazards that Deoxys-S sets up with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: While Defoggers can be stopped by Taunt, spinners are a great problem for Deoxys-S, as Deoxys-S can't stop them without the help of a teammate. Poison Heal Blastoise is especially effective, as it threatens Deoxys-S and spinblockers with Scald. However, the switching in of a spinblocker is very predictable.</p>",

Taunt prevents slower leads from setting their entry hazards up, and it can also prevent other Pokemon from using Deoxys-S as setup fodder. Knock Off is a filler move that gives Deoxys-S an offensive presence before it faints, so Deoxys-S can break Focus Sash, and Sturdy and even remove some annoying items from foes. Psycho Boost can be used over Knock Off, as it is a very powerful STAB move that deals a lot of damage. Magic Coat can be used over Taunt in order to prevent faster Taunt users, especially Prankster + Taunt users, from blocking entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 216 Defense EVs are given to Deoxys-S to increase its bulk in order to resist most priority moves. This spread allows Deoxys-S to be OHKOed by only a few Pokemon in the tier; 40 Speed EVs, on the other hand, allow it to outspeed Mega Manectric, the fastest non-Choice Scarf user. Red Card allows Deoxys-S to phaze opposing Pokemon after being hit. This helps Deoxys-S with setting up as many entry hazards as possible, making it less weak to priority moves. An Impish nature is chosen with Knock Off, whereas a Bold one is chosen with Psycho Boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Deoxys-S has to be used as a lead almost always except when the opponent might have a Magic Coat user or a slow spinner. Use Taunt in order to prevent entry hazards from being set up or to outrun other Taunt users, if it's needed. Set up as many entry hazards as possible in order to pressure the opposing team. Be careful because entry hazards should not be removed easily, so if you are facing a Defogger, use Taunt, and, if you are facing a spinner instead, switch Deoxys-S out in order to block Rapid Spin with a Ghost-type.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers and Pokemon able to get an advantage from Defog, such as Competitive and Defiant users, are all great partners; in fact, Deoxys-S is often KOed early-game, and it is therefore important to maintain the entry hazards set by Deoxys-S. Flash Fire Doublade is a good partner, as it is the only spinblocker that can deal with Choice Scarf Desolate Land Victini, which is about the only viable Pokemon able to OHKO Deoxys-S. Magic Bounce users can help deal with Pokemon with Prankster that are able to prevent Deoxys-S from setting up entry hazards.

  "Staraptor": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing a very solid Attack stat and STAB on Flying-type moves, Staraptor is one of the best revenge killers in the metagame with Gale Wings, though it faces some competition for the title. Most notably, Staraptor clashes with Honchkrow and Braviary, both of which have higher Attack and HP stats, in addition to overall superior bulk, which are critical for Gale Wings Pokemon to function. However, Staraptor's access to Close Combat means that unlike Braviary and Honchkrow, it does not need to lower its Attack when using its Fighting-type coverage move, and a relatively high base Speed among Flying-types allows it to outspeed and revenge kill every other common Gale Wings user in the metagame. Double-Edge is another move that heavily benefits Staraptor, as it allows Staraptor to break through many of its Electric-type checks far better than Braviary can with Return. Arguably the most useful tool of them all, however, is its access to the coveted Final Gambit, giving Staraptor the ability to eliminate switch-ins to its Flying-type moves, meaning it works well on teams with other Flying-type attackers. Unfortunately, like its companions, Staraptor has rather limited coverage, causing it to be unable to do much to its regular counters bar using U-turn or giving up its life with Final Gambit. In addition, Extreme Speed is very common in the tier, and because of this Staraptor is not without common revenge killers of its own.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tailwind is an option on Staraptor that allows it to support its team with a priority Speed-boosting move before it goes down, though it often cannot find space for the move. Pursuit is another option with a surprise factor to trap weakened Pokemon and Pokemon weak to Dark, but it isn't terribly strong due to Staraptor's lack of Dark STAB. Tinted Lens allows Staraptor to break through its usual switch-ins, but Staraptor is not as threatening to everything else without priority. Poison Heal may seem like an attractive option seeing as it heals Staraptor's recoil damage and gives it access to Facade, but Braviary does this better with both superior bulk and access to Bulk Up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Doublade and Aegislash</strong>: Given that Aegislash and Doublade either resist or are immune to every move Staraptor has, both of these Pokemon are the best available counters to Staraptor. In addition, they can't be trapped by Magnet Pull users due to their Ghost typing, though they must watch out for Pursuit users such as Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon that Resist Normal and Flying</strong>: Resisting both Brave Bird and Double-Edge in addition to taking neutral damage from Close Combat, Skarmory, Diancie, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross all have no problems taking any attack Staraptor has to throw at them. Other Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Regirock also work decently, though they must watch out for Close Combat. However, it is important to note that Staraptor can eliminate all of these Pokemon using a full-health Final Gambit, which can be problematic for them if Staraptor's team has other Flying-types that these Pokemon are meant to handle.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Intimidate Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Cresselia, and Mandibuzz are excellent switch-ins to Staraptor courtesy of their immense physical bulk. However, keep in mind that all of these Pokemon can be severely weakened by Final Gambit.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Speed</strong>: Genesect, Lucario, and Entei are all examples of Pokemon that can revenge kill Staraptor with Refrigerate or Tough Claws Extreme Speed thanks to the move's higher priority than Brave Bird.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird, given priority by Gale Wings and backed up by Staraptor's excellent Attack stat and a Choice Band, allows Staraptor to revenge kill most of the metagame. Close Combat maims Rock-types and Steel-types, which would otherwise have little to fear from Staraptor. Double-Edge is the Normal-type STAB move of choice, netting a very important 2HKO against Intimidate Zapdos after Stealth Rock, one of the most prominent Pokemon used to check Gale Wings users in the metagame. Return is a possibility over Double-Edge that, while being weaker, does not wear Staraptor down with recoil. However, it does not net the 2HKO on Intimidate Zapdos, making it an inferior choice. U-turn allows Staraptor to maintain momentum in addition to scouting the opponent's switch-in and possibly accumulating hazard damage. Final Gambit, on the other hand, is often the preferred choice on teams with another Flying-type attacker or Gale Wings user to eliminate the opponent's best Flying-type check, giving leeway for your other Flying-type Pokemon to sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gale Wings turns Staraptor into one of the metagame's best revenge killers. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature maximize Staraptor's damage output, letting it hit as hard as possible, and 96 Speed EVs allow Staraptor to outspeed maximum investment neutral-natured Braviary, the fastest relevant Gale Wings user other than Staraptor itself in the metagame. The rest of Staraptor's EVs are dumped into HP so it can take as much recoil damage as possible. Finally, a Choice Band increases Staraptor's Attack even further, bringing the power of its moves to very dangerous levels. Sharp Beak is also a possibility that alleviates prediction, but the drop in power from Choice Band is noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Staraptor should be used as a revenge killer, forcing out almost all attackers that don't resist Flying-type attacks under the threat of its extremely powerful Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. In general, Staraptor should almost always be using Brave Bird, as the move's priority is Staraptor's top selling point. However, if you expect a Rock-type or Steel-type to switch in, Close Combat should be used, and the same should be done with Double-Edge and Electric-types. Stealth Rock is extremely detrimental to Staraptor's performance given it reduces the number of Brave Birds Staraptor can use. This means that keeping Stealth Rock off the field should be a top priority when using Staraptor. Because of this same reason, switching Staraptor in directly is also ill-advised due to its low defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can remove Stealth Rock from the field via Rapid Spin or Defog such as Skarmory and Mew make great partners for Staraptor. Gale Wings Skarmory, most notably, is an excellent teammate to Final Gambit Staraptor, since it can proceed to sweep itself once Staraptor lures and KOes the opponent's Gale Wings check. Entry hazards of your own from a Pokemon such as Deoxys-S or Ferrothorn are also recommended when utilizing Staraptor, as the additional damage they provide help Staraptor score many crucial OHKOs. Flash Fire Steel-types such as Doublade can absorb most faster priority attacks, which force Staraptor out of the field. Magnet Pull Pokemon such as Heatran and Rotom-W can trap and eliminate otherwise problematic Steel-types that can absorb Brave Bird such as Skarmory. It is highly recommended to use U-turn on Staraptor if a Magnet Pull teammate is being used, as Staraptor can pivot directly into the Magnet Pull user after a Steel-type switches in. Finally, pivots that can help Staraptor get into play without taking any attacks such as Vaporeon and Umbreon greatly aid Staraptor. Both of these examples are also notable for being able to offer Staraptor Wish support, which can extend its presence on the battlefield and restore Final Gambit to full power.</p>"

  "Honchkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Honchkrow makes it mark in the metagame with the highest Attack and Special Attack stats of all common Gale Wings users, beating out Pokemon like Braviary and Staraptor. What's more, with access to Sucker Punch in addition to Gale Wings, both of its strongest STAB moves have priority. It also has access to some fantastic moves in Superpower, Pursuit, and, when utilizing its Special Attack stat, Dark Pulse. However, though Honchkrow is the strongest Gale Wings user, it is also one of the frailest, with bad defenses both physically and specially. Honchkrow is also prone to being worn down due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and susceptibility to Brave Bird recoil. Due to its low Speed stat, it's also weak to common (and faster) Gale Wings, Refrigerate, and Pixilate priority users such as Staraptor, Entei, and Lucario.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt could be used to stop Pokemon like Suicune and Snorlax from setting up. Tailwind is usable to support slower teammates that can dish out some major damage with the help of Tailwind. Substitute is an option on the Life Orb set, as it gives Honchkrow a chance to take an extra hit while firing off one of its very powerful attacks. Nasty Plot and Heat Wave are also options with Honchkrow if one decides to run a more specially oriented set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Priority Users</strong>: Gale Wings, Refrigerate, and Pixilate users such as Staraptor, Entei, and Lucario can come in and easily KO Honchkrow with their priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon That Resist Flying</strong>: Pokemon like Skarmory, Diancie, and Zapdos can easily wall Honchkrow with their great natural bulk, though they can be broken down by the Adaptability set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Intimidate Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Hippowdon, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz can come in on Honchkrow, cut its Attack with Intimidate, and wall it, though with Adaptability and Dark Pulse, some of these Pokemon can be broken down.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is probably the easiest way to wear down Honchkrow outside of its own Brave Bird. With the combined Stealth Rock and Brave Bird damage, Honchkrow won't last very long.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird and Sucker Punch are Honchkrow's two strongest STAB moves, with both also coming with priority. Though Honchkrow will be locked into Sucker Punch with a Choice Band equipped, it's still its Dark-type STAB move of choice as it provides an extra form of priority. Pursuit allows Honchkrow to effectively trap Pokemon that would want to switch out of an incoming Brave Bird, such as Latios and Gengar. Superpower allows Honchkrow to hit Pokemon like Rock- or Steel-types such as Tyranitar and Heatran for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band gives a major boost to Honchkrow's already exceptional Attack stat, making it extremely hard to switch into due to its sheer power and possible coverage moves. Gale Wings is Honchkrow's ability of choice, helping out with its lackluster Speed and giving its strongest move, Brave Bird, priority. An Adamant nature and maximum investment in Attack and Speed allow Honchkrow to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible while also hitting as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Honchkrow should be used as a wallbreaker, revenge killer, and cleaner. Never click Sucker Punch unless you know for sure the foe is attacking, as Honchkrow could become setup fodder if the opponent predicts Sucker Punch. With Pursuit and a Choice Band, it can deal major damage to a Pokemon that is obviously switching out. Honchkrow can be brought in on a predicted Ground- or Psychic-type move, but it is generally safer to use a pivot or send it in after another teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Honchkrow has fantastic defensive synergy with Steel-types such as Doublade and Aegislash that can handle faster Gale Wings and -ate ability users that can KO Honchkrow. It also appreciates the help of entry hazard removers such as Skarmory and Zapdos, as with Stealth Rock up, Honchkrow can be worn down even more easily. Though it wants entry hazards off its own side of the field, Honchkrow wants them up on the other side, as extra residual damage on foes can help with Honchkrow's job as a cleaner. Setup sweepers such as Lucario and Manaphy complement Honchkrow, as they allows it to clean more easily late-game. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Victini, Genesect, and Zapdos can bring Honchkrow in safely to break down more walls.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird and Dark Pulse are Honchkrow's obvious STAB moves, and Brave Bird also gets priority with the help of Gale Wings. Dark Pulse is a nice special STAB option, as it hits Doublade, Aegislash, and Skarmory, all of which are very common switch-ins to Gale Wings users. Pursuit allows Honchkrow to trap and KO Pokemon that want to switch out such as Latios and Gengar. Roost increases Honchkrow's longevity, which is especially helpful with Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil wearing it down. Sucker Punch is an option over Pursuit, as it gives Honchkrow an extra priority STAB option over Brave Bird. Superpower can be used over Roost to allow Honchkrow to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, such as Tyranitar and Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Life Orb gives a nice boost to all of Honchkrow's already strong moves, though one could also opt for Sharp Beak, which avoids Life Orb's recoil but only boosts the power of Brave Bird. Gale Wings is the obvious ability for Honchkrow, especially with its low Speed stat, giving priority to its strongest attack, Brave Bird. A Naughty nature allows both of Honchkrow's already high attacking stats to stay at their maximum levels. Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Honchkrow to hit as hard as possible while also outspeeding as many Pokemon as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as an effective revenge killer and cleaner with its very strong priority moves in Sucker Punch and Brave Bird. With the number of switches it can force, it might be best to Pursuit trap the threats switching out, as damage on them is always great, but also be aware that mispredicting the switch could end up with Honchkrow being KOed. With two immunities to common types in Ground and Psychic, Honchkrow can pivot in at any time with the right prediction. Roost should be used if Honchkrow forces a switch and is low on HP, increasing its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Honchkrow works well with Steel-types to cover other Gale Wings users, such as Doublade and Aegislash. It also appreciates the help of entry hazard removers such as Skarmory and Zapdos, as with Stealth Rock up, Honchkrow can be worn down even more easily with Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil. Setup sweepers such as Lucario and Manaphy appreciate Honchkrow's ability to break walls, as it makes their job easier. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Genesect and Zapdos can bring Honchkrow in safely.</p>"
      },
      "Adaptability": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Honchkrow's strongest move, and it can do a huge amount of damage even to Pokemon that resist it when boosted by Life Orb and Adaptability. Sucker Punch is its other physical STAB move, providing a form of priority for Honchkrow to hit faster foes. Pursuit is used to hit Pokemon that try to switch out, but be aware of Pokemon that can KO Honchkrow when staying in. Dark Pulse is Honchkrow's special attacking option, allowing it to hit Pokemon like Doublade and Skarmory for some nice damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Life Orb gives a nice boost to all of Honchkrow's attacking moves, further increasing its wallbreaking prowess. Adaptability is Honchkrow's ability, boosting the damage of its already strong STAB moves even further. It also allows Honchkrow to get past some of its normal counters such as Zapdos and Hippowdon. A Naughty nature allows Honchkrow to preserve both of its fantastic attacking stats while also keeping its Speed stat intact. Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Honchkrow to hit as hard as possible with physical attacks while also outspeeding as many Pokemon as possible. The last 4 EVs are invested in Special Attack to give it a tiny boost to Dark Pulse's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Adaptability Honchkrow should always be used as a wallbreaker due to its great attacking stats both physically and specially and the huge boost from its ability. Try never to bring Honchkrow on any attacks or when entry hazards are up, as with Brave Bird and Life Orb recoil, Honchkrow is worn down fairly easily as is. With immunities to Ground- and Psychic-type attacks, Honchkrow can pivot into them, but it's usually better just to bring it in safely off a U-turn or Volt Switch or when a teammate faints. Try to use Pursuit when the foe obviously has to switch out, as it gets a nice chunk of damage in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types are always great partners, such as Doublade and Aegislash, as they can handle Gale Wings and -ate ability users fairly well. Setup sweepers such as Lucario and Manaphy appreciate Honchkrow's ability to break down walls for them to have an easier team cleaning late-game. Entry hazard removers such as Tentacruel and Zapdos are essential with Honchkrow, as it's extremely easy to wear down with Brave Bird, Stealth Rock, and Life Orb damage. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users can bring in Honchkrow safely to break down more walls.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Lucario has both excellent physical and special attacking stats, giving it the role of an unpredictable offensive presence. Access to Extreme Speed gives it powerful priority, making it a perfect candidate to take advantage of Refrigerate, further increasing the number of roles it can fill. Having both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot allows Lucario to become incredibly strong with both physical and special sets. With access to solid coverage moves like Dark Pulse and Crunch, Lucario is difficult to check, and its 4x resistance to Stealth Rock allows it to switch in often. However, Lucario has a mediocre Speed stat that causes it to lose to many offensive threats. It also has poor bulk, leaving it especially vulnerable to being revenge killed. Its secondary typing gives it several key weaknesses in the AAA metagame, without providing good STAB moves. Overall, Lucario is a strong attacker that has great boosting and priority moves that provide it with the versatility to fill several roles excellently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using a Choice Band set with Tough Claws provides Lucario with immediate wallbreaking power, but it loses its niche of having access to Swords Dance. Iron Tail and Ice Punch can also be considered on Tough Claws sets to hit threats like Togekiss and Gliscor. A Scrappy set can surprise Doublade and other Ghost-types. Mixed Adaptability sets take advantage of Lucario's great stats in both its special and physical attacking categories, allowing it to beat many of its usual checks. A Lum Berry can be considered on physical sets, as it can cure Lucario of a burn or paralysis and give it a better chance against Scald users such as Suicune.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Doublade is Lucario's main counter, as it resists Steel and is immune to Fighting. It also beats Lucario with the combination of Sacred Sword and Shadow Sneak. Crunch and Dark Pulse are Lucario's way of dealing with Doublade, but they do not KO it without prior boosts from Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory survives a boosted Close Combat and is a Gale Wings user that is not weak to Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed. Its Brave Bird OHKOes Lucario after a Close Combat Defense drop. Also, bulkier Skarmory sets can often switch in on Lucario's attack and use Brave Bird or Counter to deal significant damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Intimidate Users</strong>: Intimidate Hippowdon can switch in on and wall Lucario and defeat it with Earthquake. Zapdos also switches in on the Tough Claws set. Gliscor is another great user that can switch into the Tough Claws set, while Skarmory can switch into the Refrigerate set. All of these threaten Lucario by being able to reliably switch into its attacks, and then defeat it in a head-to-head match up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison Heal Users</strong>: Suicune survives unboosted hits from Lucario and threatens back with Scald burns, greatly threatening Lucario's physical sets. Cresselia is another Poison Heal user that defeats many physical Lucario sets, as it resists Close Combat and can deal decent damage with Psyshock, or get Calm Mind boosts up. To beat Poison Heal checks, Lucario needs to get a Swords Dance or Nasty Plot boost up.</p>",

      "Physical Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is pivotal for raising Lucario's Attack to a level that allows wallbreaking. Close Combat takes full advantage of Lucario's typing and Attack stat, with few setbacks. Extreme Speed makes up for Lucario's mediocre Speed by providing it with a strong Tough Claws-boosted priority move. Crunch is boosted by Tough Claws and provides coverage for Lucario's main counter, Doublade, as well as other Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Using a Life Orb gives a significant boost to Lucario's Attack. Tough Claws provides a sizable boost to all of Lucario's moves that make contact, which suits its movepool perfectly. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize its wallbreaking ability, in addition to a Jolly nature failing to reach a key Speed benchmark. However, Jolly can be used to outspeed certain threats such as Entei, preventing them from revenge killing Lucario. The EVs are set to maximize Lucario's Attack and Speed.</p> <p>Usage Tips</p> <p>========</p> <p>This set looks to get a Swords Dance boost whenever possible. Bringing Lucario in on slower foes provides the opportunity to do so, or at least to unleash a powerful Close Combat. Using a slow Volt Switch or U-turn is a great way to get Lucario into this position. Users must be wary of paralysis and burns; Suicune in particular should not be taken on unless Lucario is already boosted, and even if Lucario is boosted, an Unaware Suicune can take it down. Pairing Lucario with a strong special attacker is a great way to provide double switch opportunities to eliminate special walls.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special attackers such as Adaptability Latios appreciate Lucario's ability to eliminate special walls. Status absorbers such as Poison Heal Suicune and Mandibuzz pair well with Lucario. Suicune in particular is a great teammate as it can also switch into Doublade. Storm Drain Zapdos or Rotom-H are more great teammates, as they can eliminate Suicune and provide momentum with Volt Switch. Primordial Sea Rotom-W can switch into Fire-type attackers and Gale Wings users, as well as provide momentum with Volt Switch. Mold Breaker Deoxys-S is a great way to spread entry hazards, which make Lucario's job much easier.</p>"

      "-ate Speed Abuser": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance brings Lucario's Attack to a devastating level. Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed perfectly complements a Fighting STAB move, in addition to making up for Lucario's mediocre Speed. Close Combat is a very powerful STAB move with only a minor setback, allowing Lucario to break through most foes that aren't extremely physically bulky. The fourth move choice depends on the team's coverage needs. Crunch hits Levitate Doublade, which is Lucario's main check, while Stone Edge hits Volcarona and Moltres.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the best item choice, as it significantly boosts Lucario's power while still allowing it to use Swords Dance. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it maxmizes Lucario's Attack without missing out on a key Speed benchmark; Jolly, however, does let Lucario outspeed specific threats, such as Entei. The EVs are set to maximize Lucario's Attack and Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volt Switch or U-turn to get Lucario in safely. Taking advantage of predictable switches by the opponent to get a Swords Dance up can change a game. Lucario can be used to offensively check most Gale Wings users; however, it cannot switch in to them. It cannot take on physical walls such as Suicune and Hippowdon, unless it has previously gotten boosts up. Users must be wary of status, as a burn or paralysis will significantly decrease Lucario's effectiveness.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks and pivot options to Doublade are very important; Zapdos and Suicune fill this role well. Volt Switch and U-turn users are great choices to give Lucario momentum. Tough Claws Scizor and Genesect as well as Storm Drain Rotom-H have good synergy with Lucario. Sheer Force special attackers such as Thundurus-T are good options to defeat bulky walls that Lucario struggles with, mainly Mew and Suicune.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot brings Lucario's Special Attack to soaring heights after one boost. Aura Sphere is the preferred STAB option for Adaptability sets, while Focus blast gets boosted by both ability options and hits harder than Aura Sphere, but it comes with a high miss rate. Flash Cannon also gets boosted by both Adaptability and Sheer Force, and it provides Lucario with a strong secondary STAB move to hit foes that resist Fighting-type moves. Vacuum Wave is a special STAB priority move that gets boosted by Adaptability and often surprises opponents; it makes up for Lucario's mediocre Speed and works especially well on Modest sets. Dark Pulse should be heavily considered over Vacuum Wave when you're using Sheer Force, as it makes Lucario able to deal with Doublade.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adaptability makes Lucario's STAB moves stronger and works great with Vacuum Wave to beat some Gale Wings users. However, Sheer Force also provides a boost to Dark Pulse, giving Lucario more versatility. Life Orb boosts all of Lucario's moves while still allowing it to use Nasty Plot. The EVs are set to maximize Lucario's Special Attack and Speed. Modest is the preferred nature because Lucario does not reach a crucial Speed tier if running Timid. In addition, Modest Adaptability-boosted Vacuum Wave is more than enough to make up for Lucario's mediocre Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set holds the surprise factor for opponents expecting a physical attacker, which allows Lucario to KO physical walls or get up a Nasty Plot boost. Bringing Lucario in during situations where it would be suspected that it is physical plays to this deceitfulness. With Adaptability, a Modest nature, and Life Orb, Lucario gets a guaranteed surprise KO on most Gale Wings users after one boost and Stealth Rock damage. Entry Hazards are thus important for lowering foes' initial HP levels. Lucario works very well as a late-game sweeper when its checks and counters have been eliminated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D are both excellent for spamming entry hazards. Adaptability Tyranitar pairs well with Adaptability Lucario, as it can Pursuit trap bulky Psychic-types as well as beat many special walls. Latios is another great partner, as it loves taking advantage of Lucario weakening opposing walls. Also, Latios beats certain threats that outspeed Lucario, such as Garchomp. A reliable special wall, such as RegenVest Escavalier, is a great partner to take on foes that outspeed Lucario and resist Vacuum Wave, such as Latios.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini is one of the better offensive Pokemon in the tier due to its high-Base Power moves and unpredictability, being able to attack with both physical and special sets and to run multiple viable abilities, such as Desolate Land, Tough Claws, Sheer Force, and Tinted Lens. Though its Attack is average, the boost from its abilities, as well as the high Base Power of its moves, allow it to hit hard. Its bulk is decent enough for an attacker, allowing it to take a hit if need be, and it has a decent typing that allows it to switch into common moves such as Focus Blast, Psyshock, and Pixilate- or Refrigerate-boosted Normal-type moves. It can lure in standard answers to its more common physical set with a Sheer Force special set if need be.</p> <p>However, Victini is weak to common Dark-type moves such as Pursuit and Knock Off, the former of which is problematic due to V-create's stat drops forcing Victini to switch out a lot, and the latter of which weakens Victini by removing its item while still dealing a lot of damage. It also has no reliable way to get around Flash Fire and Primordial Sea users. Lastly, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock and is vulnerable to all other entry hazards, which is a very big problem for the same reasons as Pursuit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>No Guard is plausible alongside low-accuracy moves such as Inferno, Thunder, Focus Blast, as well as Taunt to get around RegenVest users and passive walls. Magic Bounce with a set Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, V-create, and Bolt Strike is usable to break stall. Magic Guard is an option to negate two of Victini's biggest roadblocks in entry hazard damage, and Life Orb recoil, giving a power boost to all of Victini's moves, without locking it into one move. Mold Breaker is usable as a last-resort option against Flash Fire users, while Drought can be used over Desolate Land if you'd rather have Victini support the team. Download is viable if running a mixed set. Adaptability is another option to give a huge power boost to V-create. However, the lack of a power boost to Victini's other relevant moves makes Adaptability a somewhat subpar option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flash Fire and Primordial Sea Steel-types</strong>: Flash Fire users such as Doublade, which takes very little from Bolt Strike and can set up to +2 and subsequently OHKO Victini with Shadow Claw, and Ferrothorn, which can switch in and use Victini to set up entry hazards, are prime answers to Victini.</p> <p><strong>Other Primordial Sea Users</strong>: While not as common as Steel-types, other users of Primordial Sea such as Suicune, Tornadus, Tornadus-T, and Raikou can easily switch into Victini, take no damage from V-create, and hit it hard with boosted Water-type moves, Hurricane, and Water-type Weather Ball, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Goodra can function as a decent stop to the physical set, completely shuts down the special set, and can phaze Victini with Dragon Tail. Latios and Latias can decimate Victini with their Adaptability-boosted Draco Meteor. Zygarde can boost with Coil to withstand Victini's onslaught, recover health with Poison Heal, and hit it hard with Outrage or phaze it with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Honchkrow can hit a fleeing Victini with Pursuit, OHKOing it after V-create's defense drops, and both can nail Victini with their STAB moves should it stay in.</p> <p><strong>Motor Drive Manaphy</strong>: Motor Drive Manaphy can easily switch in on Bolt Strike and use Victini as setup fodder, possibly counter sweeping your team. It has trouble switching in, however, as it will take a lot of damage from V-create.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon such as Regenerator Regirock and Poison Heal Rhyperior can switch into Victini's physical set and hit it hard with STAB Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Due to Victini's only average bulk, Gale Wings users such as Skarmory, Staraptor, and Braviary can easily deal heavy damage to it with Brave Bird before it can move. Tough Claws Extreme Speed users such as Lucario and Genesect can also do this; however, both are fairly shaky checks due to their Steel typing, which means that Victini can deal with them by using a Fire-type move as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards can cause Victini a lot of problems due to its tendency to switch in and out a lot and can lower its health to the point where a priority move will finish it off.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Victini's average Speed, faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Garchomp, and Thundurus can outspeed it and deal a lot of damage to it with their STAB moves.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>V-create is Victini's main STAB move, hitting really hard with the boosts from Choice Band and Desolate Land or Tough Claws. Bolt Strike is used to get around Water-types such as Vaporeon and Suicune, keeping the latter from setting up, while also hitting Flash Fire Skarmory. U-turn is used to retain momentum if the matchup is poor and also does decent damage to Tyranitar if not using Brick Break. Trick can be used to cripple a wall that Victini just can't break, including Flash Fire users such as Ferrothorn as well as Primordial Sea users such as Scizor, Zapdos, and Raikou. Brick Break is usable in the last slot to smack Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Flash Fire Steel-types such as Ferrothorn. Zen Headbutt can be used as well, preferably with Tinted Lens to get a stronger hit on Flash Fire or Primordial Sea users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs capitalize on Victini's wallbreaking capabilities while allowing it to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible. The last 4 EVs should be placed anywhere except HP in order to be able to switch into entry hazards an additional time. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed everything up to the Pokemon in the fairly crowded base 90-95 Speed tiers, though Adamant can be used instead for more power. Tough Claws boosts the power of all of Victini's moves. Alternatively, Desolate Land can be used to give Victini a Water immunity and a massive power boost to V-create. Tinted Lens can also be used if you want Victini to get a harder hit on Steel-types with Flash Fire and break through its traditional checks such as Zygarde and other Dragon-types. Choice Band is the preferred item for maximum power, especially considering that V-create's stat drops often mean that Victini won't have the time to switch moves, but Flame Plate can be used if you want to allow Victini to switch moves and still boost the Power of V-create; as a bonus, it can also bluff Choice Band.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Victini is best used as a mid-game wallbreaker, breaking through walls such as all variants of Suicune, some Manaphy variants and-non Flash Fire variants of Doublade paving the way for a teammate to sweep. It is also usable as a late-game sweeper once its checks and counters have been weakened or removed, or as an early-game pivot with U-turn. After using V-create, though, it is very vulnerable to priority users such as Gale Wings Braviary and Tough Claws Lucario, so you should switch Victini out after using the move. Due to its decent bulk, it can actually switch into some foes as long as entry hazards aren't up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers, are almost required because Victini is weak to Stealth Rock and will switch in and out a lot. Because it needs entry hazards to attain OHKOs, spinners such as Starmie and Mega Blastoise are optimal, but Defoggers such as Skarmory and Zapdos can also work. Magic Bounce users such as Mandibuzz, Cresselia, and Mega Diancie can even deter entry hazards from being set up in the first place. Physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario appreciate walls being weakened so they can come in and clean up. Fighting-types such as Heracross can also come in on Dark-types, especially Choice-locked ones such as Choice Band Tyranitar, which tends to Pursuit trap Victini. Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S, which can be used as a suicide lead to all but guarantee the setup of entry hazards, and Hippowdon, who can switch into Rock-type moves and has good longevity, can help Victini attain OHKOs on walls such as Ferrothorn. Bulky Steel-types such as Doublade and Intimidate Skarmory can absorb powerful priority moves such as Gale Wings Brave Bird and Tough Claws Extreme Speed. Magnet Pull users such as Heatran and Infernape can remove Flash Fire Steel-types.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>V-create is Victini's main STAB move, and due to the boosts from Tough Claws or Desolate Land, it hits any Pokemon that doesn't resist it very hard. Bolt Strike is a good way to get around Water-types such as Manaphy, Suicune, and Vaporeon. U-turn is a way to switch out of walls that Victini can't beat and to deal good damage to Tyranitar if not using Brick Break. Trick can be used to cripple foes that can take Victini's attacks, including Dragon-types such as Zygarde, Latias, and Goodra. Brick Break can be used over Trick to hit Tyranitar and get a stronger hit on Flash Fire and Primordial Sea Steel-types. Alternatively, Grass Knot can be used to break through Tyranitar, Intimidate Hippowdon, Zygarde, and Volt Absorb Suicune.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf fixes Victini's biggest flaw in its average Speed. Full investment in Attack and Speed allows Victini to hit as hard as possible and outspeed Gengar, Latias, and Latios. The last 4 EVs should be placed in any stat other than HP to switch into entry hazards an additional time. A Jolly nature is preferred for as much speed as possible, but Adamant is usable for more power. Tough Claws gives a power boost to Victini's moves, making up for its average Attack, while Desolate Land is usable for a much-needed Water immunity and a huge boost to just V-create. Tinted Lens gives Victini a way to break past its checks and counters.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to use this Victini as a revenge killer due to the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, outspeeding Pokemon in the base 110-125 Speed tiers. It can also usable as a late-game sweeper once its checks and counters have been weakened or removed, or as an early-game pivot with U-turn. Make sure Victini takes as little damage as possible in order to revenge kill as often as it needs to, so bring it in after a teammate faints or on weak or resisted attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Heracross, Latios, and Gengar can weaken the opposing team so that Victini can clean up. Slow pivots such as Zapdos can bring in Victini safely with a slow Volt Switch. As a bonus, Zapdos can also deter entry hazards from being set up in the first place with Magic Bounce or remove them with Defog. Spinners work as well, such as Mega Blastoise and Starmie, both of which can wallbreak if needed.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blue Flare is Victini's primary STAB move and will heavily dent most Pokemon that don't resist it thanks to the Sheer Force boost. Thunderbolt is used to take on Water-types such as Vaporeon and Suicune, but Thunder can be used if you'd rather give Victini a more powerful Electric-type move. Focus Blast is used to heavily damage Flash Fire Steel-types. The last slot is a toss-up between two moves. Glaciate hits Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Zygarde as well as Flash Fire Grass-types, while U-turn is an option to preserve momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Special Attack and Speed investment allows Victini to hit as hard as possible and outspeed as many Pokemon as possible. The last 4 EVs should not be in HP to let Victini switch into entry hazards one additional time. A Timid nature is preferred to avoid getting revenge killed by Pokemon in the base 90-95 Speed tier, but Modest can be used for more power. Sheer Force gives Victini a boost to its attacks with secondary effects, and Life Orb provides an additional, recoil-free boost to all such attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Victini makes for a great lure for physical walls such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as many people expect Victini to be a physical attacker. Keeping entry hazards off the field is a top priority due to the fact that Victini will be switching in and out a lot. U-turn should be used to conserve momentum against special walls Victini can't beat and to deal decent damage to Tyranitar. Victini can switch into weaker attacks due to its decent bulk as long as entry hazards aren't up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is a top priority due to Victini's massive entry hazard weakness, preferably from Rapid Spin users such as Starmie and Blastoise because Victini needs entry hazard damage to attain OHKOs. However, Defoggers such as Skarmory and Zapdos also work well. Magnet Pull users such as Infernape and Heatran can trap and remove Flash Fire Steel-types. Similarly, Adaptability Tyranitar can trap and KO special walls such as Goodra and Meloetta with Pursuit. Physical attackers such as Doublade and Skarmory greatly benefit from the luring and removal of physical walls. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, which can reliably switch into Rock-types and can set up entry hazards multiple times and Deoxys-S, which is almost guaranteed to set up entry hazards thanks to its blistering Speed, work well with Victini to help it attain OHKOs it normally wouldn't. Fighting-types such as Lucario can come in on Choiced Dark-types such as Choice Band Tyranitar, which will Pursuit trap Victini when given the chance.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is a solid defensive Pokemon in the metagame with an excellent defensive typing, great utility, and a wide support movepool, making it a solid choice on balanced and defensive teams. It can check or counter the majority of the common offensive threats in the metagame, thanks to its excellent defensive stats and typing, while still having some offensive utility thanks to its good STAB combination and decent Attack, even when uninvested. It also has rare access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, making it a solid option on teams in need of entry hazards. However, Ferrothorn is prone to getting worn down thanks to its lack of reliable recovery and can be trapped by common Magnet Pull users. It will almost always be moving last thanks to its poor Speed, and it is somewhat passive and thus can be used as setup fodder by some common boosting attackers such as Skarmory.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Tough Claws sets can be used to lure in frail Pokemon such as Latios and Heatran that assume that it's defensive and can be OHKOed by the correct coverage move, but such sets are used more as single-use lures and lack the utility and staying power of defensive sets. Similarly, offensive Curse sets with Flash Fire can be run as a more surprising bulky setup sweeper. Magic Bounce can be used to reflect opposing entry hazards and can sometimes catch foes off guard, but it otherwise lacks the utility provided by Ferrothorn's main abilities. Prankster allows Ferrothorn to set entry hazards with increased priority but, again, is otherwise mediocre compared to its main abilities. Regenerator can also be run to give Ferrothorn some much-needed recovery, whereas Bulletproof allows it to wall Sheer Force Gengar. Rocky Helmet can be run to get extra chip damage on foes, but Ferrothorn prefers the recovery that Leftovers provides, as it's otherwise reliant on Leech Seed and Wish passing for healing. Shed Shell can be held to prevent Magnet Pull users from trapping Ferrothorn, but the item is otherwise useless and comes at the high cost of losing Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Magnet Pull users such as Infernape and Heatran pose the largest threat to Ferrothorn, as they can trap and KO it, leaving previously walled teammates free to cause issues for the rest of Ferrothorn's team. However, this can be circumvented with the rare Shed Shell.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Thanks to their resistances to both Grass and Steel, opposing Steel-types have little to fear from Ferrothorn. Some, such as Lucario and Scizor, can set up on Ferrothorn for a sweep, while others such as Genesect can simply fire off powerful attacks while taking little damage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: No matter what ability Ferrothorn runs, most Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr, can easily switch into it and threaten it out with their super effective STAB attacks. Some, such as Breloom and Blaziken, can also use Ferrothorn as setup fodder, as it can do fairly little to them.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Magic Bounce users such as Zapdos and Cresselia are Ferrothorn's greatest threats, as they prevent it from doing anything useful aside from attacking. However, running Mold Breaker prevents Magic Bounce Pokemon from reflecting its entry hazards and removes them as a threat.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulkier setup sweepers that aren't weak to one of Ferrothorn's STAB moves, such as Snorlax and Mega Scizor, can easily boost on Ferrothorn while only being mildly annoyed by Leech Seed and proceed to sweep the rest of Ferrothorn's team. However, Unaware variants of Ferrothorn can ignore their boosts and stall them out with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Heatran and Mew are capable of shutting down Ferrothorn by forcing it to simply use its somewhat weak attacking moves. Taunt Skarmory can also set up on Ferrothorn and beat even Unaware variants one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Ferrothorn's lower Special Defense, strong special wallbreakers such as Tinted Lens Latios and Sheer Force Gengar can break through and KO Ferrothorn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power Whip is Ferrothorn's best STAB move and allows it to threaten bulky Water-types such as Suicune. Leech Seed can give Ferrothorn extra passive recovery and allows it to weaken bulkier foes that otherwise wall it such as Doublade. Stealth Rock can be used to wear down opposing teams, although Ferrothorn has difficulty fitting it onto its set. Spikes can also be run if one of Ferrothorn's teammates is already running Stealth Rock. Knock Off allows Ferrothorn to cripple foes by removing their items and can force Poison Heal users to play more carefully around Ferrothorn before activating their Toxic Orb, as well as hitting Victini and Doublade. Worry Seed can also be run to force Poison Heal users to switch out, as well as save Ferrothorn from being trapped when predicting Magnet Pull users to switch in. Thunder Wave allows Ferrothorn to cripple setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario so that it can avoid being setup fodder, while Gyro Ball gives Ferrothorn a strong secondary STAB move to hit faster Dragon- and Flying-types such as Latios and Braviary. Iron Head can be run instead for more reliable damage versus slower foes such as Conkeldurr. Protect can also be run to get free turns for Ferrothorn to get more passive recovery from Leftovers and potentially Leech Seed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment and 32 Defense EVs with an Impish nature give Ferrothorn as much physical bulk as it can afford, while the 228 EVs in Special Defense allow Ferrothorn to survive two +3 Ice Beams from Manaphy and KO it with Power Whip. Flash Fire is the preferred ability, as it helps Ferrothorn to wall many offensive Fire-types, such as Victini and Entei, which can otherwise easily switch into Ferrothorn's resisted dual STAB moves and OHKO it. Primordial Sea can also be run to better beat Fire-types with Mold Breaker, at the cost of leaving Ferrothorn vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp. Mold Breaker can be run to help Ferrothorn set up entry hazards and Leech Seed versus teams with Magic Bounce users, preventing it from being mostly dead weight against them. Unaware prevents Ferrothorn from being setup fodder for common sweepers such as Doublade and Skarmory lacking Taunt, allowing Ferrothorn to outstall them when using Leech Seed. Leftovers is by far the best item for Ferrothorn, as it provides some extra longevity and can work together with Leech Seed to keep Ferrothorn somewhat healthy. Zero Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature should be used when running Gyro Ball to make it hit as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ferrothorn should be used to set up entry hazards first and foremost to begin chipping away at the opponent's team as early as possible. Attempt to scout for opposing Magic Bounce users before going for hazards if not running Mold Breaker, as common users such as Mew and Chansey can easily switch into Ferrothorn and reflect its hazards. Use Leech Seed as much as possible, as it can keep Ferrothorn healthy while crippling foes, potentially allowing Ferrothorn to stay healthy enough to keep switching into stronger attackers throughout longer matches. If running Flash Fire, Ferrothorn can be used as a mostly reliable switch-in to Fire-types such as Entei and Heatran. However, be careful of freely switching Ferrothorn into Trick + Choice item variants of Victini and Substitute or Taunt variants of Heatran, as they can both beat Ferrothorn one-on-one. Similarly, Ferrothorn is capable of beating some setup sweepers such as Skarmory and Doublade one-on-one if running Unaware but should otherwise switch out versus them in order to avoid being setup fodder. Avoid burns if possible, as they render Ferrothorn mostly useless. If running Primordial Sea, Ferrothorn can be used to disrupt opposing weather teams by forcibly changing the weather to heavy rain upon switching in and removing all weather conditions when switching out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive walls such as Goodra are important teammates for Ferrothorn, as it can be a somewhat free switch in for strong special attackers such as Landorus and Hydreigon. Wish passers such as Vaporeon and Chansey can keep Ferrothorn healthy throughout longer games to make up for its lack of reliable recovery, both of which are also notable specially defensive walls. Fighting-type checks such as Zapdos and Latias are useful for covering Ferrothorn's main weakness, although switch-ins to Fire-types such as Suicune and Mega Ampharos are also essential for non-Primordial Sea or Flash Fire variants of Ferrothorn. Unaware users like Suicune are very useful for non-Unaware variants of Ferrothorn, which can often find themselves setup fodder for sweepers such as Skarmory and Gyarados. Strong wallbreakers and sweepers such as Latios and Mega Gyarados appreciate Ferrothorn's entry hazard support to wear down their defensive switch-ins and more easily break or sweep the opposing team. Azumarill is a notable partner for Ferrothorn, as it can check both Fighting- and Fire-type Pokemon as well as take advantage of Ferrothorn's entry hazards to wallbreak easily if running Huge Power or act as a defensive partner if running Poison Heal. Magnet Pull users such as Heatran can be used to remove opposing Steel-types, which can easily wall Ferrothorn otherwise. Heal Bell users such as Chansey and Diancie can help keep Ferrothorn free of burns. Ghost-types such as Doublade and Gengar and Defiant or Competitive users such as Mega Metagross and Mega Ampharos, respectively, can help spinblock and discourage Defogging once Ferrothorn has set up entry hazards.</p>"

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>Braviary is a Pokemon to watch out for in the Almost Any Ability metagame. It is arguably the metagame's best Gale Wings user: it's faster than Honchkrow, and more powerful than Staraptor; it is also bulkier than both of them. Unlike Skarmory, it can hit hard without boosts and isn't walled by Steel- and Electric-types. It also has access to Superpower, which, when combined with its STAB moves, allows Braviary to hit everything in the metagame apart from Doublade for neutral damage. If you don't need a Gale Wings revenge killer, Braviary can also run a Bulk Up set with Poison Heal to break through stall teams. Despite facing competition from Snorlax, Braviary has more than enough tools to stand out from it: it's faster, and more powerful, and also has reliable recovery in Roost, and packs a STAB move that nothing is immune to in Brave Bird.</p> <p>Things aren't perfect for the all-American eagle, though, as its weakness to Stealth Rock in tandem with the recoil it takes from Brave Bird wear it down quickly. Braviary is also walled by Doublade and Skarmory, two very common threats. Refrigerate Extreme Speed users such as Lucario and Genesect can also check Braviary.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Sky Plate or Sharp Beak could be used on the Gale Wings set, but Braviary would lose out on a lot of power. Shadow Claw can 3HKO Doublade, but it has little utility elsewhere; Braviary also just doesn't have the space for it. Sleep Talk is an option if running Choice Band, but Return and Tailwind power and utility respectively are more useful for that set. There are a few more abilities that can be used on the Bulk Up set. Delta Stream negates all of Braviary's weaknesses, making it very difficult to take down after a few boosts. Tinted Lens gives Brave Bird almost perfect neutral coverage, as Magnezone is the only Pokemon that Pokemon with a 4x resistance to it. Braviary can use Defog, but Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Togekiss are better users of that move due to their superior defensive typings and better overall bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Doublade and Skarmory wall Braviary completely. Doublade can set up on it, while defensive Skarmory can phaze it out with Whirlwind. Mega Metagross can handle anything Braviary does and hit it back hard with a Tough Claws-boosted Meteor Mash.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bulky Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-W can survive a Choice Band-boosted Return and OHKO Braviary with Thunderbolt. Faster Electric types such as Raikou and Thundurus can endure a Brave Bird, outrun Braviary, and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. However, many of the faster Electric-types will have to watch out for a Choice Band-boosted Return.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar resists Return and Brave Bird and can OHKO Braviary with Stone Edge. It is OHKOed by Superpower, though. Mega Diancie can outrun Braviary and can OHKO it with Diamond Storm; it also takes little damage from Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Speed and Faster Priority Users</strong>: Refrigerate Genesect and Lucario can outprioritize Braviary with their respective Extreme Speeds and OHKO it, although they are both are OHKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird, so they can't switch into it. Staraptor is faster than Braviary and can OHKO it with its own Gale Wings-boosted Brave Bird, but likewise, it is OHKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird or Return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Gale Wings Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is the main attack on this set, getting STAB and gaining +1 priority thanks to Gale Wings. Superpower hits Rock- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar and Heatran that resist Braviary's STAB moves for super effective damage. U-turn lets Braviary scout switch-ins and grab momentum, which can be useful to get in a teammate that possesses the ability Magnet Pull. Return is the other STAB move on this set, hitting Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos that resist Brave Bird hard. Tailwind can be used as a last-ditch move to help Braviary's teammates outrun a would-be check.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band gives Braviary great power, allowing it to 2HKO almost everything that doesn't resist its STAB moves. The Speed EVs let Braviary outrun max Speed Adamant Honchkrow, and Attack is maximized for optimum power; the rest of the EVs are placed into HP for some extra bulk. The EV spread is flexible: maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is viable too, if you're worried about being outrun by opposing Braviary. Braviary can also run an EV spread of 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe if you prefer bulk over Speed—44 Speed EVs let it outrun uninvested Suicune and Cresselia. Gale Wings is chosen in order to circumvent Braviary's average Speed with a priority Brave Bird.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Even though Braviary's not frail, this set has no recovery whatsoever, so don't switch it in recklessly. When possible, bring it in via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn or after one of its teammates faints. If you're pairing Braviary with a Magnet Pull user such as Heatran or Raikou, using U-turn early in the game is advised to draw out the likes of Skarmory. Be sure to keep an eye out for Extreme Speed users, as they will outprioritize Brave Bird. Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed will really hurt; Lucario and Genesect are notable users of this move. Brave Bird will be Braviary's go-to move most of the time, unless your opponent still has Pokemon that resist it. A well-timed Return or Superpower could open up a vital hole in your opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mega Swampert, and Landorus-T can remove the Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types that resist Braviary's Flying STAB and help clear the way for a sweep. They can also come in on the Volt Switch users that Braviary draws in and help conserve momentum.</p> <p>Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is a top priority when using this set. Latias can provide Defog support and heal Braviary with Healing Wish; Excadrill can spin away the entry hazards and check Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types. Entry hazards help Braviary get KOs it otherwise couldn't: Stealth Rock allows Braviary to 2HKO 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Cresselia most of the time with Brave Bird. Ferrothorn has good defensive synergy with Braviary, as it resists Electric- and Rock-type moves; Braviary can also check the Fighting-types that Ferrothorn fears. Magnet Pull users such as Heatran and Rotom-W can also trap and remove bulky Steel-types, most notably Skarmory. While Braviary fears Doublade and Skarmory, they both, ironically, make for good teammates, as they can switch in on the Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed users that Braviary draws to it.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up boosts Braviary's Attack and Defense, giving it the power and bulk it needs to sweep. Brave Bird is Braviary's primary STAB attack, as nothing is immune to it. Roost provides reliable recovery, helping Braviary grab more opportunities to grab boosts. Facade can be used to hit Electric-types, and to act as a STAB move with no recoil. Its high PP also lets Braviary stall out Unaware Cresselia and Suicune. Substitute could be used instead to avoid Leech Seed, Worry Seed, and Dragon Tail. Superpower can also be used to hit the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Brave Bird super effectively. Protect is also an option if running Poison Heal to guarantee that Toxic Orb will activate; it also lets Braviary scout the foe's moves and grab another turn of recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 HP EVs give Braviary a HP stat divisible by 8, thus maximising Poison Heal recovery. 52 Speed EVs let Braviary outrun uninvested Rotom-W. The rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense for extra bulk. Since Bulk Up boosts Attack and Defense, those stats don't need investment. If running Substitute or Gale Wings, run an EV spread of 252 HP / 204 SpD / 52 Spe, as that lets Braviary make 101 HP Substitutes, meaning that Seismic Toss won't break them in one hit. Toxic Orb is used to activate Poison Heal, giving Braviary passive recovery and an immunity to status ailments. Gale Wings could also be used to offer a balance of stallbreaking and sweeping. If running Gale Wings, Leftovers should be used for passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used mid- and late-game once Braviary's checks and counters have been weakened. It's important to note that while this set is very effective against stall teams, it struggles against heavily offensive teams. Weak walls with no phazing moves such as Alomomola, Porygon2, and non-Skill Swap Chansey are ideal to set up on. Keep Braviary away from users of sound-based moves such as Noivern, as they those moves bypass Substitutes. Also, be wary of Knock Off users if Braviary hasn't been poisoned yet. Phazers such as Skarmory and Hippowdon can stop this set before it gets too far, so make sure they're out of the picture before setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong Ground-types make for good allies to soften up the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Brave Bird and Facade, namely Tyranitar and Heatran. They can also come in on the Electric-type moves that Braviary is weak to. Physical wallbreakers such as Tough Claws Genesect and Swords Dance Lucario can soften up or outright remove Braviary's checks. Despite Braviary's access to Roost and Poison Heal, entry hazard removal is still strongly recommended to make it less reliant on recovery. Excadrill, Skarmory, and Latias can provide this support; the former two can also set up entry hazards themselves.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>With great mixed defensive stats as well as a fantastic defensive typing, Mandibuzz finds it place as one of the best Defoggers in the metagame. Furthermore, with a great movepool, decent Speed for a defensive Pokemon, and access to greater abilities than its original ones such as Poison Heal, Delta Stream, and Prankster, it's one tough Pokemon to bring down overall. As for its movepool, it has a wide variety of support moves such as Taunt, Defog, Knock Off, and Whirlwind. However, Mandibuzz has a Stealth Rock weakness, cutting a fourth of its health lost each time it switches in, which is is pretty crippling for a Defogger. It's also worth mentioning that while Mandibuzz is a Taunt user, its also susceptible to Taunt itself, considering that the majority of its movesets won't have attacking moves. Lastly, its offensive stats are pretty lackluster, which is detrimental considering that the metagame mostly revolves around offensive playstyles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unaware is a strong ability for almost any defensive threat, but on Mandibuzz it just doesn't increase its walling capabilities like the other abilities do, and it has already many ways to handle setup sweepers. Brave Bird offers a way to check Fighting-types in general, such as Heracross. Magic Guard is also useful for absorbing status and being immune to Stealth Rock, but Zapdos is a better Magic Guard user due to it being immune to Thunder Wave. Mandibuzz can provide slow pivoting with U-turn on any of the sets if there is no need for some of the moves slashed there. A set with Regenerator + U-turn is actually quite good to form a VoltTurn core. On any of the sets but Poison Heal, Rocky Helmet can be run, but Mandibuzz will be more pressured to use Roost often due to having no passive recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>** Fairy-types **: Fairy-types are the ultimate counter to Mandibuzz, resisting every single of its attacks and inflicting hard damage on it. Pokemon that come to mind include Mega Diancie and Mega Altaria, especially the former, which can't be affected by Whirlwind or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Pixilate and Refrigerate</strong>: Pixiliate and Refrigerate allow several threats that Mandibuzz would otherwise shut down to inflict severe damage on it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Without Poison Heal or Magic Bounce, Mandibuzz's effectiveness is extremely hindered while it's burned or poisoned, making it setup fodder to pretty much any relevant physical threat.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is Mandibuzz's nightmare when it's not running Magic Bounce, and Mold Breaker allows Taunt users to go even through that. Taunt also prevents Mandibuzz from using Roost and Defog, allowing some Pokemon to easily beat Mandibuzz. Most Taunt users have enough bulk to take a few Foul Plays as well.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Heracross and Lucario are great checks to non-Brave Bird Mandibuzz sets, as Mandibuzz can't do much back to them, even with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Defiant or Competitive users</strong>: Defiant or Competitive users such as Metagross and Ampharos can switch in on a Defog and get an easy +2 boost, which obviously threatens Mandibuzz.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is an obligatory recovery move to keep walling Pokemon that can only 3HKO Mandibuzz. Foul Play is the optimal choice for an attacking move on a physically defensive Mandibuzz; with it, Mandibuzz is guaranteed to beat a good number of physical attackers in the metagame. Knock Off is another fantastic option and a good way to cripple both special and physical attackers. Do not run Foul Play in conjunction with Intimidate, though, as it's counterproductive. Taunt is the preferred option due to its several uses, including preventing boosting and recovery, allowing Mandibuzz to slowly taking down its foes. Whirlwind is a good alternative if Mandibuzz is running Knock Off; this way, Mandibuzz will be able to still force out physical sweepers. Defog removes entry hazards from both sides of the fields, benefiting both Mandibuzz's teammates and itself with absence of Stealth Rock. Toxic is a way to slowly beat several walls or special attackers that take little damage from any of Mandibuzz attacking moves, such as Cresselia. Toxic is a generally inferior choice, however, because of the omnipresence of Poison Heal among the walls of this metagame.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mandibuzz's Defense EVs allow it to maximize its overall physical bulk to take physical attackers better. 248 HP allows Mandibuzz to switch into Stealth Rock five times, and 44 Speed EVs allow Mandibuzz to outspeed uninvested Suicune, Taunt it, and eventually win beat it one-on-one with Knock Off. They also allow Mandibuzz to phaze a Suicune using Roar with Whirlwind as well as outspeeding neutral-natured Cresselia. If you are not interested in outspeeding these two Pokemon, just move the Speed EVs to Defense while investing the leftover EVs into Special Defense. A balanced spread with investment in both defenses is not good; Pokemon just hit too hard in AAA, and a mixed EV spread will leave Mandibuzz unable to switch in on anything important. Poison Heal is the ability of choice so that Mandibuzz exploits its amazing recovery every turn and also makes it immune to other statuses once the Toxic Orb activates. Magic Bounce is an alternative ability that still allows Mandibuzz to avoid status, Taunt, and entry hazards at the same time, sending all of these back to the opponent. Intimidate is another great ability for being a better switch-in to physical attackers, although Mandibuzz misses recovery from Poison Heal, which is generally better to have. Prankster is also an option, as it gives priority to all of Mandibuzz's non-attacking moves. A Bold nature is supposed to be used alongside Foul Play, while an Impish one should be run along with Knock Off. Toxic Orb activates Poison Heal, but Leftovers can be used to provide valuable passive recovery if Mandibuzz is running Intimidate or Prankster.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pokemon that Mandibuzz can easily switch in on and later force out or KO with the suggested spread include Aegislash, Doublade, Skarmory, Snorlax, Mega Metagross, non-Choice Band Genesect, Suicune, and Mega Gyarados. Avoid Knock Off before getting poisoned when running Poison Heal. On the other hand, Mandibuzz should absorb Knock Off after acquiring its status, as it will take little damage from it and Toxic Orb will no longer be needed. However, do note this is not recommended if you are planning to use moves such as Aromatherapy and Heal Bell later in a game. Taunt and Defog shut down any chances of setting up entry hazards again, while Taunt and Toxic beat defensive Pokemon without Poison Heal. If it can switch in on the turn the foe sets up Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce, thus without taking damage, Mandibuzz will be able to avoid several 2HKOs later on the match. Try the best you can to switch in Mandibuzz on minimally threatening attacks so that it can start to wear down the opposing team. While Magic Bounce can be used to reflect back both enemy hazards and status moves, be on the lookout for the common Mold Breaker is common. Defiant and Competitive wielders are rather uncommon, but most of them are Pokemon with a Mega Evolution, such as Metagross and Ampharos, so think twice about Defogging when you see one of them. An Intimidate set can be used to switch in on a predicted Swords Dance or Dragon Dance to mitigate the boost, giving the foe a hard time having a solid damage output. However, Mandibuzz running Intimidate is vulnerable to all forms of status, so try to prevent them with Taunt whenever its possible. On the other hand, feel free to switch in on physical attacks even when Mandibuzz has been worn down a bit when running Intimidate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Balanced teams appreciate Mandibuzz's ease on dealing with setup sweepers. Stall teams also like Mandibuzz's entry hazard removal and support moves such as Knock Off and Taunt. These teams really appreciate Magic Bounce's capability of sending Taunt, status moves, and hazards back to the foe. This set is quite vulnerable to Fairies, so Pokemon such as Heatran that have good defensive synergy with Mandibuzz are appreciated. If not using Defog, always pair Mandibuzz with a Pokemon that can remove hazards, such as Skarmory or Mew. Special walls such as Chansey are Mandibuzz's best friends. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Staraptor and Braviary would make good use of Mandibuzz's hazard removal capabilities. Clerics such as Chansey and Umbreon are crucial teammates, especially paired with the Intimidate set, when Mandibuzz can't avoid status moves; however, note that a cleric is not as needed when running Poison Heal. Unaware Pokemon such as Cresselia are great options to deal with Defog and Competitive users that take advantage of Defog's evasion drop. Specially defensive Pokemon that struggle to deal with physical attackers such as Chansey form a great core with Intimidate Mandibuzz.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is Mandibuzz's fantastic and reliable recovery move. Knock Off is the preferred option due to this set focusing on Special Defense, but Foul Play is still a good option if you want to nail physical attackers harder. Taunt stops recovery and boosting moves, giving Mandibuzz the edge over walls and setup sweepers. Whirlwind is a good option to accumulate entry hazard damage and check setup sweepers. Defog is a great move to remove hazards if your team needs them off the field, while Toxic is a must-have to slowly beats walls if your team already has ways around hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Delta Stream is the preferred option in order to mitigate Mandibuzz weaknesses, while Volt Absorb is great for teams that want to deter Volt Switch and Thunder Wave. Volt Absorb also is useful if Stealth Rock is on the field. Prankster is also an option because it gives priority to all of Mandibuzz's non-attacking moves. The given EVs focus on Special Defense because Delta Stream cancels out three of Mandibuzz's weaknesses, two of which are mostly specially oriented, namely Electric and Ice. The Speed EVs allow Mandibuzz to outspeed Suicune and possibly phaze it before it can Roar out Mandibuzz. A Careful nature is preferred to use alongside Knock Off, while a Calm nature is better when you're using Foul Play.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mandibuzz has three fewer weaknesses with Delta Stream so it doesn't need to fear common STAB moves such as Thunderbolt. Note that Delta Stream does not mitigate the Stealth Rock weakness, as entry hazard damage goes before ability activation. If your Mandibuzz wields Volt Absorb, try to switch it in on an opposing Volt Switch, as gaining momentum is valuable. Watch out for Defiant or Competitive users, as they can be quite a pain if you allow them to get +2 off a Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams lacking a Thunder Wave and Volt Switch immunity would find it good to run Mandibuzz. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Zapdos, Staraptor, and Braviary are good teammates, as they appreciate Stealth Rock gone. Fighting-types Pokemon give this set more trouble due to its lack of physically defensive investment, so Cresselia, Doublade, and Aegislash are fantastic teammates in order to patch up this weakness. Pokemon running Unaware such as Suicune are great options to deal with Pokemon that get a boost from the Defog Evasion drop with Defiant and Competitive.</p>"

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona is an underestimated Pokemon in the Almost Any Ability metagame. It has access to Quiver Dance, a fantastic boosting move that allows it to be a great late-game special sweeper. Its incredible base 135 Special Attack lets it hit very hard, while base 100 Speed lets it outspeed the unboosted metagame after a Quiver Dance. Bug / Fire is a potent offensive typing, as STAB Bug Buzz makes Volcarona one of the few boosting sweepers that can break through Unaware Cresselia. It also offers useful resistances to Fighting, Grass, Bug, Steel, Ice, and Fairy, which means it resists Pixilate- and Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed and can set up on defensive Bug- and Steel-types.</p> <p>Despite Volcarona's powers, a massive weakness to entry hazards means Magic Guard is required on teams without sufficient hazard control, and many Steel-types run Flash Fire or Primordial Sea, which makes it harder for Volcarona to clean up. Volcarona's physical bulk is underwhelming too, and Gale Wings users give it a hard time, as they can easily revenge kill it with a priority Brave Bird.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sheer Force powers up Bug Buzz and Fire Blast while also letting Volcarona use Life Orb without recoil. Mold Breaker bypasses Flash Fire, although it has little utility elsewhere. Tinted Lens can help Volcarona get past bulky Fire-types. A Coba Berry lets the bulky set endure a Brave Bird from Choice Band Braviary at full HP and OHKO it with a +1 Fiery Dance after Braviary has taken Stealth Rock damage. You could forgo Quiver Dance for a simple 3 attacks + Roost set, but Moltres is superior in that role, as it has better STAB coverage. A Toxic Orb could be used on Magic Guard sets if you fear paralysis and sleep, but generally the power of a Life Orb or the passive recovery of Leftovers is more beneficial.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon with Gale Wings</strong>: Skarmory, Braviary, Honchkrow, and Staraptor can all reliably revenge kill Volcarona with a priority Brave Bird, although none can safely switch in to a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls with Unaware</strong>: Unaware Chansey stops Volcarona and can cripple it with Thunder Wave or, if Volcarona's running Desolate Land, stall it out with Toxic. Unaware Suicune completely walls Magic Guard Volcarona and can set up in its face or phaze it with Roar. However, the offensive Quiver Dance set will 2HKO with Solar Beam if Volcarona is running Desolate Land.</p> <p><strong>Fire-immune Steel-types</strong>: Flash Fire or Primordial Sea Escavalier and Scizor wall Volcarona, although neither can do too much back. Flash Fire Skarmory can switch in on anything Volcarona does and OHKO with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite resists Bug-, Fire-, and Grass-type moves and can easily 2HKO bulky Volcarona with a Tough Claws-boosted Outrage.</p>",

      "Offensive Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's Speed, Special Attack, and Special Defense, enabling it to sweep late-game. Fire Blast is the main STAB move, 2HKOing most Pokemon that don't resist it, such as Levitate Heatran, after a boost or two. Bug Buzz has perfect accuracy and gets strong hits on Latios and Latias while also letting you break through Unaware Cresselia. Roost enables Volcarona to set up on more defensive teams. Use Morning Sun instead if running Desolate Land, as that heals 66% HP in sun. Giga Drain can be used to hit Water-types hard and heals a little of Volcarona's health. Solar Beam can be used instead with Desolate Land, as it hits much harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs let Volcarona tie with other Choice Scarf-using base 100s after a Quiver Dance while hitting as hard as possible. Magic Guard allows Volcarona to circumvent its huge weakness to entry hazards and use a Life Orb without recoil. It also lets you defeat passive teams that rely on Toxic stall. Desolate Land can be used to give Volcarona a Water immunity as well as a boost to Fire Blast's power, as long as you can reliably remove Stealth Rock. It also lets Volcarona use a one-turn Solar Beam, which 2HKOes Suicune. Life Orb should be used if Volcarona is running Magic Guard, as it grants Volcarona tremendous power and has no recoil. If you are running Desolate Land, Lum Berry is the safer option to negate status once.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set plays like most boosting sweepers: come in on something Volcarona forces out, use Quiver Dance, and KO as much as you can. If you are running Magic Guard, weak walls with no access to phazing moves such as Cresselia and Alomomola are ideal to set up on, as their Toxic won't damage Volcarona. Be wary of Skill Swap from the former, though, as it will take away Magic Guard. If you are running Desolate Land, defensive Water-types like Suicune are good to set up on, as they won't be able to harm Volcarona. However, don't switch Desolate Land Volcarona in if Stealth Rock is up unless you have no other option, as it will lose 50% of its HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Electric-types like Zapdos and Rotom-W are good teammates to check opposing Gale Wings users like Braviary and Skarmory. Doublade and defensive Skarmory both also wall them, and the latter can also set up Stealth Rock and Spikes to give Volcarona an easier time sweeping. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Swords Dance Lucario, and Sheer Force Manaphy can smash some holes in the opponent's team.</p> <p>If you are running Desolate Land, Rapid Spin or Defog support from the likes of Skarmory is a must. In addition to its ability to remove entry hazards, Skarmory can wall Braviary and opposing Skarmory. Sheer Force Starmie can also clear the field and dent most bulky Fire-types with its STAB Scald.</p>"

      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance is Volcarona's best boosting move, giving it the power, speed, and bulk to sweep. Bug Buzz is a reliable STAB move, and Fiery Dance hits quite hard and has a good chance to raise Volcarona's Special Attack. Alternatively, Fire Blast could be used for its superior Base Power, although it has fewer PP and lower accuracy. Roost offers reliable recovery, letting Volcarona boost in the face of weak walls that lack Unaware. Run Morning Sun instead of Roost when using Desolate Land, as that restores 66% HP in sun.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>228 HP EVs make Volcarona's HP divisible by 16, thus maximizing the amount of HP gained each turn with Leftovers. 60 Speed EVs let it outspeed Tornadus-T after a Quiver Dance. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense and a Bold nature is used to improve Volcarona's physical bulk. Magic Guard is used to circumvent Volcarona's massive weakness to entry hazards. It also lets it use most non-Unaware walls as setup fodder. However, Desolate Land is an option as well, as the immunity to their STAB attacks lets Volcarona counter most offensive Water-types. It also makes Volcarona's Fire STAB moves much more powerful.</p> <p>Leftovers is generally the best item to use, as the passive recovery is always helpful. However, a Life Orb lets Volcarona 2HKO physically defensive Unaware Cresselia without entry hazard damage. Only use a Life Orb if running Magic Guard, though, as the recoil will force Volcarona to use Morning Sun more often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulky Quiver Dance Volcarona will most likely need to boost more than once due to its lack of initial power. Weak walls with no phazing like Alomomola and non-Unaware Cresselia are good to set up on. Be wary of Gale Wings users like Skarmory, Braviary, and Honchkrow, as even with the extra bulk, they can still easily revenge kill this set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Electric-types like Rotom-W and Zapdos, and bulky Steel-types like defensive Skarmory and Doublade can check the Gale Wings users that keep Volcarona in order. Skarmory can also set up Stealth Rock for Volcarona. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Adaptability Tyranitar, Tough Claws Lucario, and Sheer Force Genesect can open up some holes for this set to sweep later. A Gale Wings user of your own could be useful to check the fast offensive Pokemon that trouble this set. If you're running Desolate Land, Rapid Spin or Defog support is a must. Starmie and Skarmory can provide this, with Skarmory walling most Gale Wings users and Starmie taking out opposing Fire-types that this Volcarona has trouble with.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing a fantastic Speed tier that allows it to outpace and KO common Pokemon such as Gengar and Latios and great mixed attacking stats allowing it to dish out heavy damage both physically and specially, Thundurus is one of the best attackers the metagame has to offer. Thundurus does well against both offensive and defensive teams alike, meaning it is never dead weight against any specific playstyle. In addition, Thundurus is very unpredictable, as it can opt to go for both physically and specially based sets, and it can run many moves effectively. However, a weakness to Stealth Rock means it can be worn down fairly easily, especially if it is taking Life Orb recoil, and its fairly poor bulk means it is picked off without much trouble by common priority users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magic Guard on a physical set is a possibility to evade both Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage and use a recoil-free Wild Charge, though Thundurus sorely misses the Ice-type coverage Refrigerate provides. Tough Claws is also an option on a physical set to increase the power of Knock Off and Superpower, but it is generally inferior for the same reason Magic Guard is. Thundurus can use additional boosted coverage moves such as Flash Cannon and Psychic on its Sheer Force set, though neither of them hits anything notable. Volt Switch may seem like a great option to preserve momentum, but Thundurus is far better off using opportunities it gets to strike on the field of battle than keeping momentum going, and Volt Switch can wear Thundurus down quickly due to entry hazard damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: While Thundurus is relatively difficult to wall, it is very easily revenge killed by most priority users, including Genesect, Lucario, and Entei. Pokemon with Gale Wings can also revenge kill Thundurus after it has been sufficiently weakened.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Essentially following the same idea as priority users, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini and Heatran and others that outspeed Thundurus naturally such as Starmie and Sneasel, can easily dispose of Thundurus before it can move.</p> <p><strong>Motor Drive or Volt Absorb Water-types</strong>: One of Thundurus's best checks, Motor Drive Manaphy, is capable of switching into Thunderbolt and effectively countersweep thanks to the Speed boost provided by Motor Drive. Volt Absorb Azumarill is a very solid counter to the Refrigerate set, capable of taking any attack thrown its way, and it can beat Sheer Force variants of Thundurus without Sludge Wave or Psychic as well.</p> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: Regenerator Diancie can take pretty much anything the Refrigerate set can throw at it, bar the very rarely seen Iron Tail, and can threaten Thundurus with a super effective Diamond Storm in return. However, it cannot beat Thundurus's Sheer Force set after a Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Intimidate Pokemon capable of taking Thunderbolt such as Cresselia make for excellent counters to Thundurus's Refrigerate set due to Intimidate weakening all of its moves other than its Electric-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest Pokemon</strong>: RegenVest Pokemon such as Goodra and Meloetta can take any hit the Sheer Force set can throw at them after a Nasty Plot and fight back, but they cannot defeat Refrigerate sets.</p>",

      "Icy Genie": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return provides Thundurus with an extremely strong Ice-type coverage move that outdamages even Thunderbolt in most situations courtesy of Thundurus's attack investment. Thunderbolt, while uninvested, still hits very hard due to Thundurus's great Special Attack stat and the boost provided by Life Orb. It also grants Thundurus the ability to inflict special damage and threaten physical walls such as Doublade that would have no problems taking on a fully physical set. Knock Off greatly hinders the few walls such as Diancie that can counter Thundurus by removing their item and allows Thundurus to beat Mew, which would otherwise be problematic to face. Motor Drive Manaphy does not particularly like switching into Knock Off either, as it relies on its Leftovers to heal passive damage. Superpower in tandem with Knock Off provides Thundurus with a means to dispose of Chansey, in addition to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Refrigerate turns Return into an Ice-type move with an exceptionally high Base Power of 133. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Naive nature makes Thundurus as fast as possible, while the rest of Thundurus's EVs are dumped into Attack to increase its physical damage output. Life Orb provides Thundurus with much-needed power at the cost of some longevity, allowing it to score many additional 2HKOs and OHKOs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Strive to keep Stealth Rock off the field at all times, as the chip damage severely diminishes Thundurus's longevity. Against defensive teams, Thundurus should be used early on in the game to punch holes in the opponent's defensive cores, leaving its teammates with more room to sweep. Try not to directly switch Thundurus into any attack, as its poor bulk and Naive nature mean even resisted attacks will dent it quite a bit. Thundurus's low bulk also means you shouldn't leave it in on any priority move users other than Skarmory's unboosted Brave Bird, as it is KOed or severely weakened by most of them. As a result of Thundurus's inability to switch into most attacks, free switches should be exploited whenever possible. If the opposing team carries Motor Drive Manaphy, try to avoid using Thunderbolt as much as possible. Due to Thundurus's fantastic Speed tier, it should be used to revenge kill other speedy attackers such as Garchomp, Gengar, and weakened Mega Metagross.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drizzle Pokemon such as Zapdos and Swampert allow Thundurus to run Thunder instead of Thunderbolt as its Electric-type STAB move, greatly increasing its special damage output. Sweepers such as Doublade and Skarmory that can take advantage of the holes Thundurus leaves in teams pair very well with it. Pokemon that are able to remove Stealth Rock from your side of the field, such as Skarmory and Mew, are also great partners, as Stealth Rock and Life Orb wear down Thundurus very quickly. For the same reason, Pokemon with Magic Bounce like Mew also make for great partners, as they can prevent Stealth Rock from ever being set up on the field. Entry hazards of your own are also greatly recommended, as the additional damage makes Thundurus far more difficult to switch into. Due to Thundurus's vulnerability to revenge killing, Flash Fire Doublade makes for an excellent partner thanks to its ability to switch into most priority users. Finally, pivots such as Vaporeon and Zapdos that can help Thundurus come into play without taking any hits are very helpful because of its poor bulk.</p>"

      "Sheer Force": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot increases Thundurus's power to frightening levels, bringing even the sturdiest of special walls into the 2HKO range. After the boosts provided by Sheer Force and Life Orb, Thunderbolt becomes an incredibly strong STAB move that heavily dents most Pokemon that don't resist it. Focus Blast is Thundurus's strongest option against Chansey and takes care of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill in addition to most Ground-types thanks to the move's high Base Power. Dark Pulse rounds off Thundurus's coverage nicely and allows Thundurus to score a neutral hit on frailer targets that it would rather not use Focus Blast on due to accuracy issues, in addition to allowing Thundurus to get around Meloetta more easily. Sludge Wave is another coverage option that is stronger than Dark Pulse but doesn't hit as many threats super effectively. It is also worth noting that Sludge Wave allows Thundurus to bypass Volt Absorb Azumarill, which is a rare but very effective Thundurus counter. Taunt allows Thundurus to better combat defensive teams by denying recovery and status moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sheer Force increases the power of Thunderbolt and Focus Blast in addition to negating the recoil from Life Orb, which also increases the power of its attacks, turning Thundurus into a powerful wallbreaker. Thundurus's EV spread and nature make it as fast as possible in order to exploit its great Speed tier, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Possessing formidable power after a Nasty Plot boost, Thundurus should be used to weaken special walls near the beginning of the game to provide other special sweepers with an opportunity to sweep. When using Sheer Force Thundurus, one should actively look for setup opportunities, such as against opposing Skarmory or Suicune. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field before Thundurus sets up, as it's easier to find opportunities to set up at full health. For the same reasons, try not to unnecessarily switch Thundurus into any stray attacks. Against more offensive teams without defensive cores, Thundurus should instead exploit its great Speed tier by revenge killing Pokemon slower than it, usually claiming a KO every time it outspeeds the foe. If you expect the opponent to switch into Motor Drive Manaphy, Nasty Plot should be used, as Manaphy cannot survive a Nasty Plot-boosted Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran, Latios, and other special attackers pair very well alongside Thundurus, as they can exploit the damage caused by its wallbreaking capabilities. Latios is also notable for its ability to use Memento to give Thundurus a free setup opportunity. Defog, Rapid Spin, and Magic Bounce users, such as Skarmory, Blastoise, and Mew, respectively, that help keep Stealth Rock off the field, are great help to Thundurus and help it better accomplish its job. While your own entry hazards aren't necessary by any means for Thundurus to perform its job well, they benefit it. This means entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Ferrothorn can be used. Reflect and Light Screen from Pokemon such as Deoxys-D and Cresselia very much facilitate Thundurus's task, which makes them excellent partners.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Kyurem is one of the best wallbreakers in Almost Any Ability: nothing can reliably switch in on it due to its great power and movepool. It has excellent mixed attacking stats, although its movepool favors special attacking. Kyurem is far from frail as well: 125 / 90 / 90 bulk is fantastic for an offensive Pokemon. Ice is also a great offensive typing, hitting many Pokemon super effectively. However, it is poor defensively, giving Kyurem weaknesses to common Fighting moves as well as a weakness to Stealth Rock. In fact, Kyurem hates all entry hazards, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is mandatory. Average-to-low Speed hampers Kyurem against offensive teams, and it faces stiff competition from Latios and Latias as an offensive Dragon-type, as they both are much faster and have better defensive typing. However, Kyurem has STAB Ice Beam and an easier time against Steel-types due to Earth Power and Focus Blast to set itself apart from the Eon twins.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set using Substitute, Roost, Ice Beam, and Earth Power with a Life Orb and Sheer Force could be used if you need a bulky attacker. A set utilizing Unburden, a White Herb, and Draco Meteor could make Kyurem a good late-game cleaner. A Choice Scarf set is viable, but it wastes Kyurem's amazing power and would force it to switch in and out a lot, a liability for a Pokemon susceptible to all entry hazards. Hyper Voice could be used on the Refrigerate set for a reliable special STAB move, but it doesn't really accomplish anything the combination of Draco Meteor and Return couldn't. Hidden Power Fire hits Scizor harder than any other move but doesn't accomplish much else. A mixed Sheer Force set using Ice Beam, Earth Power, Focus Blast, and Iron Head is possible, although its only real advantage is not taking recoil from Life Orb. That set could also run Download. No Guard could be used for perfectly accurate Blizzards and Focus Blasts, but a Sheer Force-boosted Ice Beam is more powerful than Blizzard and has more PP. A Choice Band set utilizing Refrigerate is possible, but Kyurem's physical movepool is extremely barren. A physical Tinted Lens set faces similar problems.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist both of Kyurem's STAB moves and can hit back hard with their own super effective STAB attacks. Levitate Doublade beats the Refrigerate set; Levitate Heatran walls sets that lack Focus Blast. Genesect outruns Kyurem and OHKOes it with a Sheer Force- or Tough Claws-boosted Iron Head. Mega Metagross outruns Kyurem and OHKOes it with a Tough Claws-boosted Meteor Mash, but it still takes heavy damage from Earth Power. However, Choice Specs Kyurem can at worst 2HKO all of them with Draco Meteor if it's running Tinted Lens.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey walls the special sets but is 2HKOed by a Refrigerate-boosted Return. Porygon2 walls the Choice Specs set if it's running Tinted Lens and the Refrigerate set if it lacks Focus Blast, but it can be 2HKOed by an Adaptability-boosted Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. Specially defensive Cresselia can take anything apart from an Adaptability-boosted Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can hit Kyurem super effectively like Genesect, Mega Medicham, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gardevoir can reliably revenge kill Kyurem, although none of them can safely switch in.</p> <p><strong>Pixilate Users</strong>: Pokemon that use the combination of Pixilate and Extreme Speed like Entei, Arcanine, Dragonite, and Zygarde can revenge kill Kyurem after it's taken some prior damage, but none can safely switch in.</p>",

Earth Power hits the Steel-types that resist Kyurem's STAB combination for super effective damage. Focus Blast also hits said Steel types, getting stronger hits on the likes of Levitate Heatran and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs simply maximize Speed and power. The final 4 EVs can be placed in either defense stat to give Download users an undesired boost. A Modest nature is preferred for maximum power, although Timid can be used to outrun Jolly Lucario. Choice Specs amplifies Kyurem's already huge Special Attack. Tinted Lens powers up resisted hits, giving Kyurem perfect neutral coverage with just its STAB attacks, as nothing 4x resists both of them. On the other hand, Adaptability can be used to make Kyurem's STAB moves much more powerful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is fairly straightforward to use: switch Kyurem into weaker Water-, Grass-, or Electric-types and fire off powerful attacks. This set is best used early- to mid-game to remove walls for teammates to sweep. Generally, spamming Draco Meteor will get the job done, especially if you're running Tinted Lens. However, if the opponent still has a Fairy-type or a special wall like Chansey on their team, they will likely anticipate this and switch, so you should use Ice Beam in those circumstances. If you're running Adaptability, you will have to predict more carefully; in particular, be wary of the likes of Heatran and Doublade. Avoid switching Kyurem in if entry hazards are up on your side, as Kyurem can soon find itself at low HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Kyurem is susceptible to all entry hazards and this set switches in and out a lot, Defog or Rapid Spin support is critical. Excadrill and Starmie can clear the field of hazards, and Kyurem can switch in on the Water-type moves Excadrill draws and the Grass- and Electric-type moves Starmie draws. Swords Dance Skarmory appreciates the holes this set can create, as Kyurem can easily take out most of the Electric-types that wall Skarmory. It can also remove the hazards Kyurem is weak to. Curse Snorlax and Nasty Plot Thundurus also appreciate this set's ability to break through Unaware walls like Cresselia and Suicune. Entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S and Ferrothorn are good teammates as well, as they make switching into Kyurem even harder.</p>"

      "Mixed Refrigerate": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor hits everything that doesn't resist it very hard. Return has an effective 198 Base Power factoring in Refrigerate and STAB, being able to 2HKO Chansey and Poison Heal Snorlax most of the time. Earth Power gets excellent coverage with Kyurem's STAB combination, 2HKOing Doublade and OHKOing Heatran that lack Levitate. Focus Blast can be used for some extra coverage, such as on Ferrothorn and Levitate Heatran. It has fewer PP and much lower accuracy than Earth Power, but it hits much harder and enables Kyurem to defeat Levitate Heatran, which would otherwise wall this set. Roost heals off Life Orb recoil and other passive damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack is maximized, as most of this set's moves are special. A Mild nature increases Kyurem's Special Attack further and is chosen over Rash because lowering Kyurem's Special Defense weakens its ability to check bulky Grass- and Water-types. Running 216 Speed EVs lets Kyurem outrun maximum Speed Adamant Lucario. The rest of the EVs are placed in Attack to power up Return. 29 HP IVs give Kyurem a Life Orb number, thus reducing the recoil Kyurem takes with each attack. A Life Orb is the best item to use, as it provides the most power. Refrigerate is the chosen ability to give Kyurem a strong physical STAB move in Return, which can 2HKO many of the special walls Kyurem lures in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used early- to mid-game to punch holes in the opponent's team. You should generally open with Return; it will cause most special walls to make a hasty retreat, and if your opponent switches in a physical wall, you can then hit them hard with Draco Meteor. If running Roost, you could pivot Kyurem into opposing Electric-types, but this is a risky strategy, as they could just Volt Switch out. It's even more dangerous if entry hazards are up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is a wallbreaker, so fast cleaners like Nasty Plot Thundurus, Volcarona, and special Genesect are good teammates. Entry hazard control is critical for this set, especially if you decide to forgo Roost. Excadrill and Starmie are good teammates for providing Rapid Spin, with Excadrill able to set up Stealth Rock as well. Kyurem can also switch in on the Water-type moves Excadrill draws and the Grass- and Electric-type moves Starmie draws. If you forgo Roost, Wish support is recommended. Vaporeon can pass Kyurem good-sized Wishes to keep it healthy, and Kyurem can switch in on the Grass- and Electric-type moves Vaporeon draws in. Hazard stackers like Deoxys-S and Ferrothorn can also be used to make this set even harder to switch into.</p>"

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Genesect's diverse movepool, paired with its great mixed offensive stats and access to power-boosting abilities, means it can easily plow through slower teams and makes it very difficult for faster Pokemon to switch in. Genesect has access to Extreme Speed, which, paired with a stat-boosting ability, makes Genesect a very potent revenge killer, and sporting the second strongest U-turn in the AAA metagame, Genesect can easily maintain offensive pressure and gain momentum while taking out huge chunks of the foe's HP when it U-turns out. Genesect's typing also grants it a nice set of resistance and a single weakness to Fire-type moves.</p> <p>However, Genesect often finds itself being outpaced and overpowered against hyper offensive teams, and full stall teams usually carry both physical and special walls that can wall different Genesect sets and wear it down via entry hazards. Other than that, Genesect variants that lack Extreme Speed are always forced out by the ever-present Gale Wings users and, bar variants that are immune to Fire-type moves, Fire-types also generally force Genesect out. Another downside to using Extreme Speed Genesect is that it's forced to use a Hasty nature due to Extreme Speed being an event-exclusive move. However, Genesect can effectively beat the checks and counters of one set with another one, making it very unpredictable and powerful. That, along with its ability to overpower a lot of the common walls or revenge kill a good amount of the metagame, makes Genesect easy to fit into most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Genesect is a naturally good Choice Scarf user thanks to its large coverage movepool and U-turn. If you're hoping to use Genesect as an offensive pivot and want longevity, Regenerator can be used over all of these abilities. Regenerator sets generally appreciate U-turn and Extreme Speed and have a wide array of special moves to choose from as coverage. Primordial Sea Genesect with Thunder and Douse Drive Techno Blast is also an option. While it's not as strong as the other Genesect sets, it's a solid switch-in to Fire-type attacks and can fit into teams thanks to its nice set of resistances and lack of weaknesses. The Tough Claws set could run Tinted Lens just as easily, boasting Genesect's ability to spam unresisted U-turns and get KOs on Steel-types with Extreme Speed. It does, however, miss the Tough Claws boost on Extreme Speed in a lot of situations. Finally, mixed sets of Genesect can actually run its original ability, Download, as it can actually outdamage some of the sets mentioned here if it gets the right boosts at the right time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Infernape, Latios, and Gengar force Genesect out, as they can threaten to outspeed and KO it, especially if they're not in Extreme Speed KO range.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: When at full health, Heatran is very threatening to Genesect, as it will survive any hit from Genesect when healthy and retaliate with a Fire-type move that will KO Genesect. Ferrothorn almost always runs an ability that makes it immune to Fire-type moves, and its great mixed bulk lets it survive Genesect's moves with ease, allowing it to take a hit and cripple Genesect with Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Magnezone boasts resistances to all of Genesect's common coverage moves, barring Fire-type moves and the uncommon Dark Pulse, and can hit it very hard with Thunderbolt. Flash Fire Scizor can take a hit and set up on Genesect while recovering HP with Roost or dealing major damage with Knock Off or Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Skarmory, Chesnaught, and Doublade all wall physical Genesect sets; however, they all fall to the special variants.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Steel-types</strong>: Barring Skarmory, most Flash Fire Steel-types, such as Doublade and Ferrothorn, can take hits from most Genesect variants and threaten it with attacks or paralyze it.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Chansey and Goodra wall all special Genesect variants. Chansey can paralyze or wear it down with Seismic Toss and recover HP with Soft-Boiled; it can even do so to win against the Iron Head variant. Goodra, however, loses to Iron Head variants of Sheer Force Genesect if it doesn't have any Defense investment, which it normally doesn't. Even Poison Heal Snorlax can greatly threaten fully special sets.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types give all Genesect variants barring Flash Fire and Primordial Sea trouble, as they can tank one hit and OHKO it in return with their Fire-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Gale Wings Users</strong>: Gale Wings users can generally revenge kill Genesect, but they are beaten by Refrigerate variants. They are also KOed by Extreme Speed variants if they're worn down enough, with the exception of Skarmory, which can't actually revenge kill Genesect from full HP without setting up first.</p>",

      "Refrigerate Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed makes Genesect a fearsome revenge killer that OHKOes all Gale Wings users bar Skarmory and heavily damages anything that doesn't resist it. Thunderbolt completes the BoltBeam combination, giving Genesect near-perfect neutral coverage. It also allows Genesect to hit bulky Water-types, which are common switch-ins to Refrigerate Genesect. Flamethrower and Blaze Kick can be used in the third slot to hit bulky Steel-types that switch into Extreme Speed. While Blaze Kick comes off of the higher attack stat in this set, Flamethrower is preferred because most Steel-types that switch into Genesect are physically defensive and Flamethrower hits them harder; it also has the added benefit of not missing. Shift Gear can also be used in this slot, as it boosts Genesect's Speed, letting it outpace almost everything in the metagame while simultaneously boosting its Attack, turning Genesect into a fearsome late-game cleaner. Iron Head can be used in this slot to hit Fairies and KO Shuckle before it can set up both Stealth Rock and Sticky Web. In the last slot, Techno Blast can be used, as it hits extremely hard when combined with the Refrigerate boost, even denting special walls like RegenVest Goodra on the switch. Alternatively, U-turn is good in the last slot because Genesect forces a lot of switches, allowing it to gain momentum while doing quite a bit of damage to the opponent's switch-in. Another interesting option for the last slot is Explosion, as it hits extremely hard when combined with Refrigerate's and Life Orb's boosts and can be used as a last-resort move to deal an insane amount of damage to switch-ins or prevent entry hazard removal from working.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs are used to maximize the power of Extreme Speed. 184 Speed EVs allow Genesect to outspeed Jolly Lucario, which would otherwise switch in on Extreme Speed and KO Genesect with Close Combat. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to boost the power of Genesect's coverage moves. Not only does Life Orb provide a damage boost for Extreme Speed, it also powers up Genesect's coverage moves, making defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory less likely to switch into it. Pixilate can also be used instead of Refrigerate for this set to hit Dark and Fighting-types harder, but it misses the OHKO on most Gale Wings users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed, Genesect serves as an offensive check to all Gale Wings users. While facing an opponent with a Gale Wings user on their team, Genesect must be brought in to revenge kill it after a Pokemon has fainted or by double switching when you predict the Gale Wings user to come in. However, keep in mind that Genesect cannot safely switch into any Gale Wings users. Genesect should not be played recklessly because, while it's a great asset against faster, frailer teams, it takes a lot of damage from most moves they throw at it, which, along with its lack of recovery and susceptibility to entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil, wears it down easily. Because Genesect will generally have to switch out after it revenge kills something, having entry hazards up on your side of the field will limit Genesect's opportunities to switch in and will wear it down very fast. Genesect appreciates having entry hazards up on the opponent's side of the field, as it breaks potential Focus Sashes and the chip damage really helps Genesect while it tries to revenge kill threats with Extreme Speed. The entry hazards will also help wear down Genesect's checks when you make double switches, predicting them switching in and forcing them to switch out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An entry hazard setter such as Mold Breaker Deoxys-S is a good partner, as it can stack entry hazards on the opponent's side while stopping the opponent from setting up their own due to Taunt, which capitalizes on Genesect's ability to force switches and wear down the opponent's team by having its checks rack up entry hazard damage. With Victini being the most common Fire-type in the AAA metagame, a Flash Fire user with Pursuit such as Doublade or Krookodile really helps Genesect out. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves that also have access to Pursuit such as Tyranitar can also work. Wallbreakers such as Adaptability Latios and Tough Claws Victini are also good partners, as they can weaken the opponent's team enough to let Genesect clean later in the game. Genesect appreciates Healing Wish support, so Latias can also be used for the added utility and bulk, but it loses out on some power compared to Latios. A Magic Bounce user such as Gyarados can work really well with Genesect because it can beat common entry hazard setters and severely dent teams after a Dragon Dance, even breaking through Unaware walls by Mega Evolving to gain Mold Breaker, leaving them in KO range for Genesect. Primordial Sea Starmie can also work as a good partner, as it can KO most entry hazard setters with its strong STAB Water-type moves or use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards when the entry hazard setters switch out. Starmie also dents physical walls that annoy Genesect and serves as a switch-in to Fire-types. Both Gyarados and Starmie can also serve as switch-ins to Fire-type attacks, the latter being more reliable due to it being able to switch in for free against Fire-types and KO them or force them out. Genesect greatly appreciates Sticky Web support if it lacks Shift Gear, as it patches up Genesect's matchup problem against hyper offensive teams by bringing the faster, frailer Pokemon into Genesect's Speed tier to let it overpower them, while the Flying-types that are immune to Sticky Web are KOed by Extreme Speed anyway.</p>"
      },
      "Sheer Force Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz 2HKOes Cresselia and most Psychic- and Dark-types in the metagame. Ice Beam hits Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and various Dragon-types that are common in AAA, KOing the ones Genesect outspeeds, such as Dragonite and Adamant Zygarde. Thunderbolt gets the 2HKO on CroCune, hits any Water-types that lack an Electric-type immunity, and completes the BoltBeam combination, giving it near-perfect neutral coverage. The last slot is basically up to you, as it'll hold a coverage move that allows Genesect to hit certain Pokemon its team needs it to hit. Dark Pulse 2HKOes Regenerator Doublade when it tries to pivot into one of Genesect's moves. Iron Head hits threats that are switching in such as RegenVest Goodra and Chansey harder than any of Genesect's other moves. Note that while using Iron Head, the nature and EVs need adjustment. Flamethrower gets the OHKO on Lucario and hits non-Fire-immune Steel-types, such as Magnezone. U-turn can be used over any one of the above moves, as Genesect has a tendency to force switches, and U-turn will let it maintain offensive momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 Speed EVs allow Genesect to outspeed unboosted base 100 Speed Pokemon, as well as Jolly Lucario and Krookodile. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Genesect to hit as hard as possible, and the rest of the EVs are put into HP for taking hits slightly better. Life Orb is the best item for this set, as it boosts Genesect's power without inflicting recoil damage, thanks to Sheer Force. When using Iron Head, the EV spread should be 56 Atk / 252 SpA / 200 Spe, and the nature should be Naive or Hasty. Naive allows Genesect to check -ate ability users slightly better, while Hasty allows it to take Draco Meteors from Kyurem better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A huge special movepool boosted by Sheer Force makes Genesect a fearsome wallbreaker. The amazing coverage gives Genesect the ability to break most of the common special walls in the metagame bar Goodra and Chansey. However, Goodra switch-ins fall to Iron Head with some prediction, as it doesn't have recovery outside of Regenerator. Genesect also makes short work of most physical walls, as they rarely have the Special Defense necessary to avoid a 2HKO from its coverage moves. While Genesect can take a few hits and retaliate, it really appreciates staying out of the gunfire as much as possible, as it can get worn down quite easily with repeated hits and entry hazards. It performs best when it can get free switches in by double switching and slow U-turns, Baton Passes, or Volt Switches. As always, Fire-types in general are threats. Genesect should never stay in against a Fire-type unless it outspeeds and the Fire-type is weakened enough to be OHKOed by Genesect's coverage moves. Genesect appreciates entry hazard support, as it limits switches, breaks Focus Sashes, and deals extra damage to foes, helping it net KOs. Lastly, because Genesect has such a wide movepool to choose from, the opponent will often scout for certain moves. It is a good idea to sometimes hold back on revealing a coverage move so that Genesect can net a KO with it later when the opponent thinks it doesn't have said move. With Refrigerate Extreme Speed being very common on Genesect, sometimes you can bluff the Refrigerate set and hit the foe with strong coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An entry hazard-setting lead such as Focus Sash Mold Breaker Deoxys-S can work well, as it can set up entry hazards and Taunt opposing setters. Genesect cannot outspeed Jolly Victini or survive a Brave Bird from a Gale Wings user, so checks to those are necessary. Regenerator Regirock can fill this role, as it can reliably switch into both multiple times. Flash Fire Doublade can fill this role too, and while it struggles with the lack of recovery letting it get worn down more easily, it can Pursuit trap all Victini and -ate ability and Gale Wings users, wearing them down as they switch out. Primordial Sea Ferrothorn can be an especially good partner, as it can switch into Entei and Victini for free and set entry hazards up, which will help Genesect net KOs more easily. Flash Fire Scizor can be a good partner as well, as it can switch into Fire-type moves aimed at Genesect and provides a slow U-turn, giving Genesect a free switch in. Scizor can also remove entry hazards to increase Genesect's longevity, and it can knock off Chansey's Eviolite and Goodra's Assault Vest, making them less reliable switch-ins to Genesect. Choice Band Adaptability Tyranitar is a good partner for Genesect, as it can Pursuit trap Chansey and Goodra, which completely wall Genesect. Because bulky Steel-types give this set trouble, Tough Claws or Adaptability Fighting-types make for good partners to Genesect as well.</p>"
      },
      "Tough Claws BandSect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn should be Genesect's go-to move and can OHKO some of the frailer Pokemon it hits for neutral damage and takes a good chunk of HP out of Pokemon that resist it. Extreme Speed deals a large amount to any Pokemon bar Steel- and Rock-types, letting Genesect clean up weakened foes. The main advantage it has over any Refrigerate- or Pixilate-boosted Extreme Speed is that this Extreme Speed isn't resisted by Fire- and Water-types, although it loses the ability to revenge kill Gengar. Iron Head 2HKOes any Rock-types that may want to switch in on the predicted Extreme Speed. There are a few options for the last slot. Blaze Kick punishes non-Flash Fire variants of Skarmory or Doublade that are switching in on any of the other moves, 2HKOing offensive Skarmory and 3HKOing bulky sets. X-Scissor provides Genesect with another strong Bug-type move that it can use without having to switch out, hitting Defense-invested Cresselia, Umbreon, Mew, and Chesnaught that may be thinking about staying in to tank the U-turn. It can also clean slower teams if they have Pokemon that resist Iron Head. Special attacks such as Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam can be used as coverage moves, depending on what you want Genesect to hit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 Speed EVs allow Genesect to outspeed unboosted base 100 Speed Pokemon, as well as Jolly Lucario and Krookodile. Maximum Attack investment allows Genesect to hit as hard as possible, and the rest of the EVs are put into HP to take hits slightly better. A Hasty nature is necessary on this set, as Extreme Speed Genesect is an event Pokemon and therefore requires it. Choice Band is the preferred item on this set, as Genesect mainly depends on predicting the next Pokemon to be coming in and switching out with U-turn, meaning it benefits most from Choice Band maximizing U-turn's power and not taking the recoil that Life Orb would cause, increasing Genesect's longevity. A Choice Band also makes Extreme Speed stronger than Life Orb would, letting Genesect revenge kill more effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Genesect can be used as a lead in matches against Deoxys-S or any clear entry hazard-setting lead, as it can U-turn out into a teammate with Gale Wings or Defog as the foe sets up hazards. From there, the teammate can force it out while using Defog or just finish it off with an attack to prevent hazards from being setup again. Against other non-Mold Breaker entry hazard leads, Genesect can U-turn out to a Magic Bounce user or an entry hazard remover while dealing a lot of damage to the foe thanks to Choice Band- and Tough Claws-boosted U-turn. In fact, this set's main niche is U-turn. It cashes in on Genesect's ability to force switches and hits the Pokemon switching in for good damage. Genesect should keep using U-turn throughout the match, only making predictions when necessary. This means keeping entry hazards away is a must while using this Genesect variant because it will be clicking U-turn and switching out most of the time. Scout for Prankster Will-O-Wisp or Flamethrower from Mew because either can completely destroy this set. When at full health, Gale Wings users can be a problem, but Genesect can pick them off with Extreme Speed after they are weakened a bit, with the exception of Skarmory. Genesect usually forces switches, so having entry hazards up on the opponent's side is a huge advantage, as it slowly wears down their team due to entry hazard damage and U-turn. After the opposing team has been weakened, this Genesect can also function as a late-game cleaner thanks to the raw power behind Extreme Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Good partners to Genesect include strong Fighting- and Fire-types that can deal with the Steel-types that like to switch into it. Magnet Pull users such as Infernape and Ampharos can work really well with Genesect, as they can trap and KO Steel-types that are switching in. Ampharos might be the better choice, as it can deal with Skarmory, which is the most common switch-in to this set, more reliably than Infernape, which cannot beat all variants of Skarmory without a Focus Sash. Other partners include Magic Guard + Defog Moltres and Defog + Tinted Lens Latios. Moltres scares away Steel-types while it uses Defog, and Latios KOes Steel-types when they stay in, expecting a Defog. They can also serve as switch-ins to Fire-type moves. If you're planning on keeping entry hazards up on your opponent's side, Primordial Sea Starmie is the better partner for this, as it can switch into Fire-types Genesect hates for free, can force a switch while it spins, and beats Gengar, which is the most common Ghost-type in the AAA metagame. It also gets Thunder to hit Jellicent and strong Scalds to hit Ghost-types in general. Primordial Sea Ferrothorn is a good partner too, as it can switch into Entei and all Victini variants and proceed to set up hazards that Genesect really appreciates. On offensive teams, the popular Mold Breaker Deoxys-S can also be used as an entry hazard-setting lead. Aside from the above Primordial Sea users, Flash Fire Doublade is a great partner, as it can Pursuit trap the Fire-types that are trying to switch out of it, weakening them to Extreme Speed KO range with Pursuit. It can also serve as a spinblocker, stopping the foe from spinning entry hazards away.</p>"
      },
      "No Guard Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Zap Cannon serves as a good coverage move with high Base Power and is guaranteed to inflict paralysis. It also benefits from Refrigerate Genesect's popularity, as Water-types are popular switch-ins to Refrigerate Extreme Speed. Blizzard is the other high-powered coverage move that can take advantage of No Guard and completes the BoltBeam coverage with Zap Cannon, giving Genesect near-perfect neutral coverage. Bug Buzz allows it to hit all the Psychic- and Dark-types in the metagame for good damage. Flamethrower hits Magnezone, which the rest of this set fails to do., and it also OHKOes Lucario. Bug Buzz and Flamethrower can be replaced with U-turn and Extreme Speed; U-turn is for chip damage while switching out after paralyzing something with Zap Cannon, and Extreme Speed helps pick off weakened Pokemon. If Moltres is used as a partner, running Flash Cannon on Genesect is an option, as it can take care of Rock-types that Moltres doesn't like.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 Speed EVs allow Genesect to outspeed unboosted base 100 Speed Pokemon, as well as Jolly Lucario and Krookodile. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Genesect to hit as hard as possible and the rest of the EVs are put into HP for a bit more bulk. Life Orb allows Genesect to pack more of a punch with its coverage moves. When using Extreme Speed and U-turn, the HP EVs should be moved to Attack, and the nature must be changed to Hasty. The Hasty nature is required because Extreme Speed Genesect is an event Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Genesect mainly aims to spread around paralysis while dealing good damage with Zap Cannon, so most of the time, the best course of action is to click Zap Cannon. Zap Cannon has low PP, so don't use it recklessly against more defensive teams. Genesect can cripple offensive switch-ins such as Victini with Zap Cannon and then proceed to KO them with Bug Buzz the turn after. Keep entry hazards away so Genesect can remain healthy for a longer period of time. Make sure to scout some Pokemon, such as Latios and Mew, before you decide it's safe to bring in Genesect because Latios could run Tinted Lens to KO Genesect, and Mew could have a Fire-type coverage move. While spamming Zap Cannon, be wary of Pokemon that benefit from getting hit by an Electric move, such as Motor Drive Manaphy, which can sweep teams after just one Speed boost. Don't play recklessly with Genesect, as the Life Orb recoil, constant switching, and lack of recovery means it'll get worn down fast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Zap Cannon forces a lot of switches, entry hazard support is greatly appreciated. This makes Deoxys-S, Ferrothorn, and Forretress good partners, as they can all reliably set entry hazards, and the latter two can even serve as Fire-type switch-ins if they have Flash Fire. Forretress can even use a slow Volt Switch to give Genesect safe switches in. Gale Wings users and Fire-types can cause trouble for Genesect, so Flash Fire Doublade can be a nice partner to deal with both. Doublade also deals with Poison Heal Snorlax, which gives this set trouble, quite well. Magic Guard Moltres is an alternate Fire-type switch-in that can scare away Steel-types, keep up momentum with U-turn, and Defog away entry hazards. An alternate entry hazard remover and Fire-type switch-in is Primordial Sea Starmie. Starmie can deal solid damage to all spinblockers, switch into Fire-types for free and proceed to spin or throw out a Scald, and it deals with most Steel-types barring Ferrothorn thanks to rain-boosted Scald. Magic Bounce Gyarados can keep entry hazards off of the field while doubling as a switch-in to Fire-type moves and a wincon. Powerful wallbreakers such as Tough Claws Pangoro and Adaptability Tyranitar are good partners, as they can deal a lot of damage to the opposing team when the opponent's Pokemon are paralyzed; the paralysis also helps slow wallbreakers overcome their lack of Speed. Adaptability Tyranitar can also Pursuit trap Chansey and Goodra, both of which wall this set completely.</p>"

  "Pangoro": {
    "overview": "<p>Pangoro has a number of desirable traits that make it one of the most threatening wallbreakers in the AAA metagame. Its high Attack stat, unique typing, and great movepool allow it to hit the entire metagame for high damage. Defensively, its typing also grants it a resistance to Rock, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock multiple times, as well as a 4x resistance to Dark, making it much easier to take Foul Play compared to most other physical attackers. The aforementioned resistances and its Psychic immunity give it many potential switch-in opportunities. Pangoro also has access to Swords Dance, further decreasing the amount of Pokemon that can switch into its attacks and allowing it to tear apart a lot of defensive teams. Despite its great matchup against defensive teams, Pangoro is unfortunately held back by its poor defensive stats and typing, making it vulnerable to a lot of priority moves. That and its lackluster Speed make it struggle to be relevant against more offensively oriented teams. Pangoro also has a lot of competition from other Fighting-types like Lucario and Heracross, which are both faster.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with Parting Shot instead of Swords Dance can be used to avoid Life Orb recoil and gain momentum with Parting Shot to potentially set up a team member for a sweep; however, this is inferior to the Life Orb set, as it requires more predictions, struggles against Poison Heal Pokemon, and is unable to get 2HKOs on some Pokemon that resist Dark with Superpower like Chesnaught. Ice Punch is a potential coverage option that allows Pangoro to take down physically defensive Gliscor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Victini and Latios can outspeed and KO Pangoro with ease, while faster Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Mega Altaria or Heracross can switch in on Pangoro's STAB moves and KO it or predict a switch and set up.</p> <p><strong>Gale Wings Pokemon</strong>: Gale Wings users all threaten Pangoro with possible OHKOs. Gale Wings Togekiss in particular can switch in on both of Pangoro's STAB moves and force it out with priority Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Intimidate Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Chesnaught and Gliscor can tank a +1 hit and threaten back with a KO.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns completely shut down Pangoro by cutting its Attack stat in half as well as stacking damage with Life Orb, though other status conditions like poison or paralysis also greatly hinder its wallbreaking capabilities.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a powerful STAB move with no drawbacks and has the unique advantage of removing items such as Leftovers and Toxic Orbs, making it hard to switch into and really spammable. It's the move you should be clicking most of the time, as even Pokemon that can tank it don't appreciate losing their item. Superpower hits Dark- and Fighting-types that resist Dark such as Mandibuzz and Chesnaught. It's also more powerful than Knock Off and can be used to secure 2HKOs against Pokemon like Suicune, but it has the drawback of dropping Pangoro's Attack by one stage. Poison Jab hits Fairies that resist Dark and Fighting for super effective damage. Swords Dance doubles Pangoro's Attack, making it capable of OHKOing the vast majority of the metagame barring a few exceptions like physically defensive Intimidate Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The set aims at maximizing Pangoro's damage output. Tough Claws, Life Orb, and an Adamant nature all boost its damage output, making it the threatening wallbreaker it is. Life Orb is preferred over Choice Band, as it allows Pangoro to switch moves and use Swords Dance. Maximum EV investment goes into Attack and Speed, as Pangoro's Speed is so mediocre that maximum investment is necessary to outspeed most defensive Pokemon like Suicune.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pangoro can do huge damage when it's in, but it's important to think about how to get it in. For that reason, VoltTurn, Baton Pass, or double switching is important, and it's not advised to switch it directly in unless into a predicted Dark- or Psychic-type move. Pangoro should avoid burns at all cost, and for that reason, it shouldn't stay in on Suicune unless it's already at +2 or if Suicune is within the range of being KOed by Superpower. Knock Off is the move that should be used the most, as it has no drawbacks, and the combination of Knock Off and Superpower KOes many defensive walls like Suicune and Skarmory. When facing a defensive team, Pangoro's main focus should be on sweeping when it is at +2; however, when it is against a team with a Dark switch-in, such as Chesnaught, Pangoro should primarily set up Swords Dance and KO it with Superpower, as it often fails to do so after using Superpower twice due to the drop in Attack. Against offensive teams, Pangoro should use every opportunity it has to attack, as it is easily forced out and more often than not will get a KO regardless.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with momentum-gaining moves are important to bring Pangoro in safely. Examples include Zapdos, Regenerator Manaphy, and Vaporeon, the latter of which provides Heal Bell and Wish support, making it harder for it to be worn down by defensive teams. Gale Wings checks are imperative; Intimidate or Regenerator Zapdos in particular can switch in on Gale Wings users and provide momentum via Volt Switch to get Pangoro safely in. Pokemon that have a good matchup against offense such as Sheer Force Deoxys-S or Gale Wings Skarmory complement Pangoro's strong matchup against stall well. Similarly, fast sweepers and priority users like Refrigerate Sneasel and Braviary can clean up after Pangoro has gotten rid of their counters. Pokemon that can take advantage of status ailments can absorb burns for Pangoro. Poison Heal Snorlax, for example, can switch in on most Scald users such as Suicune and potentially force them out.</p>"

  "Doublade": {
    "overview": "<p>Doublade is a staple in the Almost Any Ability metagame, standing out as one of the best checks to nearly every physical attacker in the format with its high physical bulk. Its excellent typing gives it a wide range of resistances and immunities, including to Flying-, Fairy-, and Ice-type moves, making it resist all three common types of priority moves as well as allowing it to spinblock with its immunity to Normal-type moves. Doublade can choose between three excellent abilities in Flash Fire, Regenerator, and Levitate, all of which change the way opposing teams are forced to deal with Doublade. It can even function as a late-game sweeper with Swords Dance, making it far less passive than most other walls. Doublade is only held back by its lack of recovery, its severe weakness to Knock Off, its somewhat mediocre Special Defense, and how easily it's walled by the metagame's most common defensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit is a good option to trap all of the Pokemon weak to Dark-type attacks in the metagame and get chip damage on Pokemon Doublade forces out. It also allows Doublade to trap and eliminate Victini if running Flash Fire. Toxic can be run over Swords Dance to whittle away at opposing teams, but it sacrifices offensive presence and can be worthless due to the high amount of Poison-immune Pokemon and Poison Heal users in the metagame. A spread of 240 HP / 16 Def / 252 SpD with an Impish nature and a set of Toxic / Shadow Claw / Iron Head / Sacred Sword optimizes Doublade's bulk, particularly its special bulk, and allows Doublade to consistently wall threats for stall teams. Doublade can run a number of abilities from Bulletproof, to Unaware, to Water Absorb, but none come with the same utility as Flash Fire, Levitate, and Regenerator.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire- and Ground-types</strong>: Depending on which ability Doublade has, Fire- and Ground-types can threaten Doublade with their super effective STAB moves. However, unless they are running Mold Breaker, Fire-types cannot use their super effective STAB moves on Flash Fire sets and Ground-types lose to Levitate sets.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon take little from any of Doublade's attacks and can do significant damage with Scald while simultaneously threatening a burn.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Users</strong>: Walls with Unaware take the same damage from Doublade regardless of Swords Dance boosts, so most Unaware users that are not weak to Doublade's STAB moves, such as Skarmory, can defeat it 1v1 thanks to Doublade's lack of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Most physical walls that aren't hit super effectively by any of Doublade's moves are able to beat it one-on-one by alternating attacking and recovering. These walls include Hippowdon, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Common Dark-types such as Pangoro and Tyranitar take little from Doublade's Ghost-type moves and can threaten it out with their super effective STAB moves. However, they have to fear being hit by Sacred Sword on the switch in, and all except Mandibuzz take significant damage from Iron Head variants, while Doublade can normally survive one hit with its high physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Knock Off is not only super effective but also removes Doublade's Eviolite, which severely reduces its bulk for the remainder of the game.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Nearly every strong special attacker without an entirely resisted moveset from Mew to Latios can 2HKO Doublade thanks to its far lower Special Defense.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance gives Doublade increased offensive presence and prevents it from being total setup fodder for Pokemon that can take its unboosted attacks, such as Skarmory. Shadow Sneak helps patch up Doublade's poor Speed by giving it a priority move. Shadow Claw is the preferred main STAB attack to hit most walls in the metagame neutrally and opposing Doublade as well as common Psychic-types such as Cresselia super effectively. However, Iron Head is an alternate STAB move that gives Doublade a little extra power over Shadow Claw and a super effective hit on Fairy-types, but it makes Doublade weaker against bulky Water-types and opposing Doublade. Gyro Ball can be used over Iron Head for a higher Base Power versus fast Pokemon, but Iron Head is preferred due to its more reliable Base Power and higher PP, which allow Doublade to more consistently hit slower threats such as Sylveon. Sacred Sword gives Doublade perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Claw and allows it to more easily beat threats such as Snorlax.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature increase Doublade's offensive presence and allow it to more easily sweep opposing teams after a Swords Dance. Near-maximum HP investment combined with an Eviolite turns Doublade into a defensive as well as offensive powerhouse, and the final 8 Special Defense EVs are used to make Doublade slightly bulkier in its lower defensive stat. Flash Fire gives it an immunity to its most common weakness, Fire, and can help it lure and cripple Fire-types such as Victini. Regenerator helps fix Doublade's lack of recovery, although it is forced to switch out to heal and doesn't get any useful immunities with it. Levitate allows Doublade to counter Pokemon that use Ground-type moves to hit Steel-types, such as Metagross and Excadrill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Doublade can be used as a strong check to some of the most threatening Pokemon in the format, as it consistently defeats threats such as Heracross and Snorlax while also beating out a wider variety of threats depending upon its ability. Flash Fire Doublade can be used as a switch-in for Fire-type attackers without Mold Breaker, and Levitate Doublade can be used as a switch-in for Ground-type attackers without Mold Breaker. However, if Doublade lacks the appropriate ability, do not switch it into Fire- and Ground-types. Doublade can be switched into nearly every physical attacker that lacks a super effective STAB attack in the metagame, but be careful about letting it get worn down through constant switches into strong attackers. Keep Doublade away from strong special attackers, as even resisted hits do significant damage thanks to Doublade's low Special Defense. Also, be wary of special attackers with Tinted Lens, such as Draco Meteor Kyurem, which can OHKO Doublade even with resisted hits. Do not automatically set up Swords Dance versus teams with checks such as Unaware Pokemon, as Doublade will be forced to switch out anyway and the boosts will be useless. It is advised to scout for Unaware users and set up entry hazards to weaken opposing teams before setting up. If running Regenerator, frequently switch Doublade out to recover. If running Pursuit, Doublade should use it when faced with foes that are Choice-locked into a Normal-, Fighting-, or Poison-type move or otherwise unable to do any significant damage to Doublade. Doublade can also use Pursuit on Pokemon that are Choice-locked into Fire-type moves if running Flash Fire and Ground-type moves if running Levitate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Doublade fits best on bulky offense and stall teams that need a good check to physical attackers and Gale Wings users. Wish passers such as Vaporeon are essential for keeping Doublade healthy throughout longer games, and Heal Bell users are recommended to keep Doublade status-free. Pokemon that resist Dark and don't mind taking Knock Offs, such as Conkeldurr and Regenerator Diancie, help patch up Doublade's Dark weakness. Pokemon with the ability Flash Fire or Primordial Sea, such as Ferrothorn and Suicune, are needed so that non-Flash Fire variants of Doublade have a teammate that can take Fire-type attacks. Similarly, Levitate or Flying-type Pokemon are important to take Ground-type moves for non-Levitate variants of Doublade. Pokemon that can take on bulky Water-types, such as Shaymin-S and Desolate Land Victini, make for good teammates for Doublade, as they can break past its most reliable counters such as Suicune and Vaporeon. Strong special attackers such as Manaphy and Gengar can also help take on physical walls that normally invalidate Doublade such as Hippowdon. Mandibuzz has excellent synergy with Doublade, as it resists Dark and Ghost and is immune to Ground, while Doublade can take Rock- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Mandibuzz. Due to the amount of switches Doublade can force, entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon should be used in conjunction with Doublade to rack up residual damage on opposing teams. Goodra and Sylveon can form the potent Dragon / Fairy / Steel core with Doublade, resisting most types in the game for a strong defensive backbone.</p>"
