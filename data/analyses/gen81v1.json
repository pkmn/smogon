        "description": "<p>Chansey is one of the bulkier walls by virtue of high HP and Eviolite, walling many prominent special attackers such as Primarina, Magnezone, and Volcanion. Toxic helps dispatch threats that can heal up on Chansey such as defensive Arcanine, Roost Kyurem, and non-Rest Togekiss. Soft-Boiled helps to keep Chansey at high HP while slowly whittling down the foe with the combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic. While Chansey's physical bulk is not nearly as good as its special bulk, the given EV investment allows for its to be as physically bulky as possible, giving it the best chance to survive a hit from Choice item Haxorus, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and non-Swords Dance Landorus-Therian, to OHKO them with Counter. Charm is an option over Counter to handle physical attackers that would like to set up on Chansey such as Shell Smash Crustle, Swords Dance Landorus-Therian, and non-Taunt Bulk Up Zeraora. Charm should be used to PP stall and negate boosts from the foe's setup moves to a point where any combination of Chansey's moves will win. Do note that replacing Counter with Charm usually results in losing matchups against Choice Band users such as Landorus-Therian and Choice Band Zeraora, which can 2HKO Chansey through Charm.</p> <p>Chansey is taken advantage of by Choice item attackers with Trick such as Cresselia, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Fini. Toxic can assist in dealing certain anti-stall measures such as Encore and Trick Togekiss and some Fake Tears Sylveon. Versus Sylveon it is optimal to use Toxic on the first turn, then Seismic Toss, then Soft-Boiled, and finally Seismic Toss to avoid being KOed by Hyper Beam at -6. Good teammates for Chansey are attackers that don't care about Trick and are able to retaliate, such as Assault Vest or Choice item Metagross and Aromatisse. Chansey also doesn't appreciate faster Taunt users such as Spectrier and Corviknight, as they PP stall Chansey and slowly chip it down. Good partners that alleviate this weakness include Choice Scarf Galarian Darminatan and Zeraora.</p>"

Minimizing Azumarill's Attack helps to lower confusion self-damage, which slightly improves the matchup against foes like Galarian Moltres.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against Tapu Fini, Azumarill should use Amnesia once and then repeatedly use Seismic Toss. This takes advantage of Tapu Fini's tendency to Iron Defense immediately against Azumarill. By boosting its Special Defense, Azumarill lowers the healing Tapu Fini gets from Draining Kiss, so it cannot outheal Azumarill's Seismic Toss. When facing Entei, you should continuously use Seismic Toss to beat it reliably. When using Icy Wind against Aggron, Azumarill should use Icy Wind turn 1. If Aggron uses Head Smash, Rest should be used until the foe faints from recoil damage.

      "Weakness Policy": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Weakness Policy is beneficial for Kartana, opposing Metagross, and Zeraora. Meteor Mash hits neutral targets like Haxorus and Regidrago hard. Bullet Punch finishes off weakened foes and Custap Berry users such as Sylveon and Magnezone. Earthquake hits Steel- and Electric-types like Regieleki and Carracosta. Psychic may seem like an odd choice, but it helps versus a few foes that Zen Headbutt wouldn't beat, such as Counter Sawk, Iron Defense Urshifu-R, Kartana, and Avalugg. Endure helps against Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Dragapult. Weakness Policy surprises many Pokemon that Metagross can tank supereffective hits from and KO back, such as Assault Vest Entei and Choice Band Steelix.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>248 HP EVs and 28 Defense EVs ensure that Metagross beats Haxorus. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to reliably beat all Regidrago sets. Metagross can run 8 Speed IVs to still outspeed Azumarill and have a better chance at activating Weakness Policy against Incineroar or some variants of Tyranitar, and it can even run 0 Speed IVs for a better opposing Metagross matchup. However, Metagross will lose reliably versus Primarina with less Speed investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against Crustle you should use Bullet Punch turn 1 because it can use Counter, and then KO it with Meteor Mash the next turn. Against Encore + Disable users like Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, and Aromatisse, always use Meteor Mash turn 1, and use Bullet Punch turn 2 to avoid being forced to use Struggle. Against Galarian Darmanitan, you should use Endure to survive Flare Blitz and KO back with +2 Bullet Punch. Against Dragapult, you should use Endure on turn 2 if Phantom Force is used, and use Bullet Punch on turns where Phantom Force will not hit. However, other Dragapult sets like Choice Specs will beat you, so be wary of that.</p>"

Bullet Punch beats Galarian Darmanitan and Earthquake beats Zeraora, Magnezone, and some Arcanine and Incineroar sets. Trick beats various stall Pokemon like Cresselia, Galarian Corsola, and Ferrothorn. Ice Punch allows it to KO Garchomp and bulky Regidrago sets, while Zen Headbutt hits offensive Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The HP EVs ensure Metagross survives Custap Berry Dracozolt's Bolt Beak, and the Special Defense EVs allow it to survive Dragon Energy into Draco Meteor from Custap Berry Regidrago. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack for better damage versus Togekiss and Regidrago. However, an alternative spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed neutral-nature base 80 Speed Pokemon, like Regidrago. Here, maximum Attack gives it the best KO odds versus Tyranitar. If you are running these EVs, you should run Thunder Punch as the fourth move for a better Celesteela matchup.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, using the strongest move is the best option. If running Trick, always use it against stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Corviknight. Against Encore + Disable Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, always use Bullet Punch instead of Meteor Mash to avoid getting locked into Struggle. Bullet Punch OHKOes some Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Weavile, and Archeops, so you should always use it to avoid the risk of getting KOed first. Against Zeraora, using Earthquake will always OHKO unless Zeraora uses Knock Off. In that case, you can use Bullet Punch turn 2 to KO it.</p>"

Swords Dance gets past stall Pokemon like Chansey and Galarian Corsola.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>96 HP EVs allow Garchomp to survive Outrage from Life Orb Zeraora, while the 44 Special Defense EVs let it take Steam Eruption from Choice Specs Volcanion. 120 Speed EVs are used to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon like Kommo-o, and 248 Attack EVs allow for better OHKO odds versus Galarian Darmanitan.

Using Endure is the best option against Pokemon that OHKO it, like Galarian Darmanitan, Dragapult and Naganadel. When in Custap Berry range, Outrage will OHKO these targets before they can move.

Life Orb-boosted Earthquake OHKOes Pokemon like Zeraora and Heatran. Scale Shot acts as a secondary boosting move by increasing Garchomp's Speed. It also counters stall Pokemon like Pressure Entei by breaking through Substitute. Poison Jab deals with Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu, whereas Outrage increases reliability versus Zapdos.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The 192 HP EVs secure the matchup versus Choice Specs Magnezone, as Garchomp survives Hyper Beam even after Life Orb recoil, and also assist versus stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Registeel, ensuring that Night Shade and Seismic Toss take five hits to KO. 68 Defense EVs and the HP investment allow Garchomp to survive Outrage from Choice Band Zeraora. The 136 Speed EVs let Garchomp outspeed some faster Pokemon after Scale Shot, most notably Entei and Spectrier, while also outspeeding Pokemon like Dracozolt without the Speed boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When versus Zeraora, use Earthquake, as you survive a Choice Band-boosted Outrage. Use Scale Shot versus Magnezone and other Sturdy users like Crustle to avoid risking Weakness Policy or Counter activation, respectively, and KO with Earthquake on turn 2. Scale Shot can also be used versus faster Pokemon like Entei and Spectrier to outspeed and KO in the following turns. The main use of Swords Dance is to break past passive stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Registeel, as they cannot do enough damage before Garchomp KOes them.

Additionally a Charm + Kee Berry set allows Togekiss to answer slower physical threats such as Metagross, Aggron, Rhyperior, and Glastrier by reducing their attack and healing with Roost, slowly chipping them down with Counter or Air Slash. A Choice Specs set sacrifices some of Togekiss's Speed for more power, being able to break down bulky Pokemon like Volcanion quickly and reliably because you don't need as many flinches. This set can also run Grass Knot as a niche move to catch Pokemon like Rhyperior and Swampert. Nasty Plot is another option that can be used over Encore on Thunder Wave variants. Nasty Plot can help against stall users like Kyurem and Leftovers Gastrodon, if running Encore. Resist Berry sets usually are paired with Counter. Babiri Berry, for example, can lure Pokemon like Metagross or Kartana by surviving a hit and using Counter. It can also run other Berries such as Wacan Berry, Charti Berry, and even Yache Berry for threats such as Choice Band Zeraora, Choice Band Landorus-T, and Galarian Darmanitan respectively.

      "Maranga Berry + Thunder Wave": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Togekiss makes use of tactical RNG manipulation through Serene Grace, Air Slash, and paralysis to immobilize and break down foes. Maranga Berry allows it to more reliably wall many special attackers such as Primarina, Sylveon, and Volcanion. Thunder Wave is useful for speed control in addition to making immobilizing foes more reliable. Roost paired with paralysis allows Togekiss to fish for paralysis turns while recovering, which increases reliability even more. Encore is useful for locking stall Pokemon such as stall Cresselia and Corsola-G into their setup moves, as well as bulky offensive setup Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Primarina, and Fake Tears Sylveon by locking them into their status moves.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The EVs allow Togekiss to survive Choice Specs Pixilate Sylveon's Hyper Beam and outspeed Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Adamant Choice Scarf Haxorus after Thunder Wave. 52 Defense EVs maximize reliability against Assault Vest Arcanine and certain Dracovish sets.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 96 HP / 140 SpA / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Togekiss to defeat Magnezone with Mystical Fire. The EV spread allows Togekiss to defeat Choice Specs Volcarona and outspeeds bulky Tapu Fini variants as well as other Maranga Togekiss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most matchups with Maranga Berry Togekiss begin with Togekiss using Thunder Wave Turn 1. However, against certain Trick users such as Cresselia and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, it is safest to use Encore Turn 1. This locks you into Encore again but nets you a free move Turn 3 to use Air Slash, which locks you into Air Slash for the final turn of Encore on Turn 4, resetting the cycle. If the foe uses an attacking move Turn 1 and deals less than half of Togekiss's health, it is generally safe to spam Roost and fish for paralysis turns before going for flinches with Air Slash. This keeps Togekiss from dropping to a stray critical hit as well as not risking being caught by priority or some other gimmick such as a surprise Custap Berry user. If the foe uses a setup or status move such as Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Substitute, Togekiss should usually use Encore to lock them into their move so they can safely break them down without needing to deal with flinch and paralysis chances as long as Togekiss outspeeds. Where Togekiss shouldn't use Encore is against Pokemon like Aromatisse. Instead, Togekiss should spam Air Slash in hopes of getting lucky and flinching Aromatisse down without being locked into Struggle by Encore and Disable.</p>"

For coverage moves, Dazzling Gleam reliably takes out threats like Haxorus and Dracozolt, while Fire Blast can be used for Ferrothorn and Kartana.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Togekiss to do as much damage as possible and outspeed as many Pokemon as possible.</p> <p>Alternatively, 16 HP / 236 SpA / 12 SpD / 244 Spe can be used to outspeed Dragapult and survive a Flash Cannon from Aegislash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, this set is pretty simple to use. Use Air Slash when Togekiss needs to flinch a Pokemon like Naganadel or Volcanion that would KO it otherwise. Use Dazzling Gleam or Fire Blast when either of them more reliably wins the matchup such as against Garchomp or Ferrothorn, respectively.

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Galarian Darmanitan uses its great Attack, decent Speed tier, Gorilla Tactics, and Choice Band to OHKO as many opponents as possible before they can move. Either Icicle Crash or Ice Punch can be used; Ice Punch has perfect accuracy, but Icicle Crash has more power, notably securing matchups against Bulk Up Zarude, Rocky Helmet Aromatisse, and physically bulky Tapu Lele. Icicle Crash also has a 30% flinch chance, allowing Galarian Darmanitan to potentially beat Sturdy users and bulkier threats like Crustle and Aromatisse. Giga Impact OHKOes many bulkier Pokemon such as Sylveon and Primarina and even has a chance to OHKO physically defensive Tapu Fini. Flare Blitz does massive damage to Steel-types, notably OHKOing Registeel and non-Occa Berry Celesteela, and also helps Galarian Darmanitan defeat slower Volcarona sets. The last move is usually one of Superpower, Earthquake, or Iron Head. Superpower helps against Tyranitar, Air Balloon Heatran, bulky Kyurem and Chansey, Earthquake beats some Arcanine and Sitrus Berry Volcanion more reliably, and Iron Head reliably beats Aromatisse.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Adamant is usually preferred, as it performs better versus bulkier Pokemon, like Tapu Fini and Aromatisse. The 4 Special Defense EVs block Pokemon with the ability Download, most notably Porygon2, from getting +1 Special Attack.</p> <p>On bulkier spreads, Giga Impact is less valuable, since it lacks the necessary Attack investment to OHKO Tapu Fini. However, it is still valuable versus Sylveon and Primarina.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 88 Atk / 244 Def / 176 Spe outspeeds Rillaboom and survives Celesteela's uninvested Heavy Slam and Life Orb Rillaboom's Fake Out + Grassy Glide.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 8 HP / 116 Atk / 132 SpD / 252 Spe survives Choice Scarf Togekiss's Fire Blast and Choice Specs Tapu Fini's Hydro Pump so that it can KO them with Icicle Crash and two Earthquakes, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Galarian Darmanitan does not have Iron Head, it should use Icicle Crash or Ice Punch against Aromatisse, rather than Giga Impact. Even though Giga Impact has a chance to OHKO, it has better odds to 2HKO with Ice Punch or Icicle Crash + Struggle. Galarian Darmanitan is 2HKOed by Moonblast and Rocky Helmet damage from Aromatisse, which means that if Aromatisse dodges or survives Giga Impact turn 1 and uses Trick Room, it can use Moonblast, disable Giga Impact as it recharges, and use Moonblast again to KO Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>With the defensive spread, use Icicle Crash or Ice Punch versus Celesteela instead of Flare Blitz. This ensures that Celesteela will not KO Galarian Darmanitan afterwards, and the Ice-type moves 2HKO most Celesteela.</p>"

Earthquake is for Nihilego, Entei, and Zeraora. The last move is more variable, depending on the needs of the team; Flare Blitz for a better Celesteela and Metagross matchup, Thrash for Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, Rock Slide for Volcarona, or Lash Out for Spectrier.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Galarian Darmanitan runs maximum Speed and a Speed-boosting nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Pheromosa. The leftover 4 EVs are put into Special Defense so Download users like Porygon2 get an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>An Adamant nature instead of a Jolly nature helps versus Heatran, but loses out on Timid Choice Scarf Kyurem and Porygon-Z, as well as other Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 160 Atk / 112 Def / 236 Spe and an Adamant nature allows Galarian Darmanitan to survive Jolly Garchomp's Stone Edge and Adamant Garchomp's Outrage, so this spread is fairly reliable versus Choice Scarf and Custap Berry Garchomp.</p> <p>If using Thrash, consider an EV spread of 4 HP / 144 Atk / 104 SpD / 252 Spe to survive Choice Specs Tapu Fini's Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In nearly every matchup, use the move that does the most damage to come out on top.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Icicle Crash and, after activating Zen Mode, Flare Blitz are Galarian Darmanitan's strongest STAB options. In most matchups, Zen Mode is triggered when Galarian Darmanitan uses Endure on an attack that would otherwise OHKO it, activating both Zen Mode and the Salac Berry. To round out this set, Galarian Darmanitan-Z can use Encore to lock opponents into non-damaging moves, such as Endure. Reversal is another option, which can defeat Kyurem and Heatran.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Adamant is the preferred nature, as base 135 Speed and at +1 Speed outspeeds all relevant threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When Galarian Darmanitan-Z can outspeed and OHKO an opponent, such as Venusaur and Ferrothorn, Galarian Darmanitan should just attack turn 1. Other matchups, where Darmanitan is outsped and OHKOed, like versus Pheromosa and Kartana, Galarian Darmanitan should use Endure, activate the Salac Berry, and OHKO the next turn.</p> <p>Note that Galarian Darmanitan-Z is much weaker without Gorilla Tactics, so it does not KO bulkier Pokemon that it normally expects to like Regidrago.</p>"

Make sure you are slower than Regidrago to have White Herb go into effect on Breaking Swipe's Attack drop and not on the Defense and Special Defense drops of Shell Smash. Solar Blade can be used on the Choice Band set to lure Pokemon such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Quagsire.</p>",

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Sturdy and Mental Herb allows Crustle to safely set up against nearly any Pokemon without the threat of Taunt, Encore, or being OHKOed. Sturdy allows Crustle to live at least one hit from Pokemon such as Celesteela, Galarian Darmanitan, Volcanion, Volcarona, Kyurem, and non-Mold Breaker Haxorus, and due to the immense power of Rock Wrecker, they will be OHKOed after a Shell Smash boost. Mental Herb allows Crustle to safely Shell Smash against Encore Aromatisse and Taunt users such as Whimsicott. Rock Blast is used to break past Substitute users such as Entei, Zapdos, or Whimsicott to avoid Rock Wrecker's recharge turn. For the fourth moveslot, Counter is often used to beat Choice item Dracovish, non-Mold Breaker Haxorus, and some Zeraora sets. X-Scissor is occasionally used over Counter to beat Trick Cresselia and Zarude consistently. Lum Berry can be used to consistently beat Yawn Sylveon and can help in the Will-O-Wisp Volcanion matchup.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Crustle to outspeed most of the metagame after a Shell Smash, while maximum Attack gives it the best rolls to OHKO a non-Defense invested Porygon-Z. Mental Herb Crustle can also use a Jolly Nature with the same EVs to outspeed Electric Seed Tapu Koko after a Shell Smash and KO it with Rock Wrecker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crustle's main strategy is to utilize the combination of Sturdy and Shell Smash to set up without being OHKOed, and OHKO back with Rock Wrecker. Crustle can also use the combination of Shell Smash and Rock Blast to break past Substitute Pokemon like Zapdos or Entei. Against Pokemon such as Primarina or Sylveon, which can potentially run Custap Berry, you may want to Shell Smash twice to avoid clicking Rock Wrecker on Endure. It is important to note that due to Crustle's low Speed tier, it will not be able to outspeed Zeraora or Dragapult at +2 Speed.</p>"

Choice Band Crustle has several options for the last move: Heavy Slam consistently beats Aromatisse and Sylveon, X-Scissor is used to beat Zarude and Trick Cresselia, and Counter beats Choice item attackers such as Dracovish, Urshifu-S, and Garchomp.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>232 HP and 24 Def EVs allow Crustle to survive Choice Band Haxorus's Outrage. 29 Speed IVs, along with a Brave Nature allow Crustle to underspeed Aegislash and OHKO its Blade Forme.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Crustle is very straightforward; in nearly every matchup you should use the strongest move, whether it is Rock Wrecker, Heavy Slam, or Earthquake. The one exception to this is against Substitute Pokemon, where Rock Blast is better.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its incredible mixed bulk, Ferrothorn can handle many top-tier threats such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Magnezone. Holding a Chople Berry allows it to beat Fighting-types such as Pheromosa, non-Fire Punch Sawk, and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Gyro Ball is typically Ferrothorn's strongest move and helps it deal with Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Tapu Lele and, Diancie. Iron Defense + Body Press allows Ferrothorn to deal with threats such as Zeraora without Blaze Kick and Chansey, increasing both its physical bulk and Body Press's power.</p> <p>For its final moveslot, it can either run Leech Seed or Power Whip. Leech Seed lets you beat Assault Vest and Haban Berry Regidrago, Assault Vest Landorus-T, and Iron Defense Registeel. Power Whip allows Ferrothorn to hit Water-types like Tapu Fini and Primarina.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>248 HP and 52 Defense EVs with a Relaxed nature allow Ferrothorn to survive a Choice Band-boosted Close Combat from Jolly Choice Band Haxorus; 28 Attack EVs ensure that Ferrothorn OHKOes Haxorus after Iron Barbs damage and the Defense drop. The Special Defense EVs are for Custap Berry and Rocky Helmet Porygon-Z,  as well as Gardevoir if Ferrothorn has Leech Seed. 0 Speed IVs is used to maximize the damage of Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Another EV spread is 248 HP / 160 Def / 100 SpD. This bulks a Hyper Beam from Choice Specs Porygon-Z and 2HKOes with Body Press.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Metagross can use Trick to give Ferrothorn a Choice item. To handle this, Ferrothorn should use a damaging move against these Pokemon (removed E accent) turn 1. Against Encore + Disable Alolan Ninetales, Ferrothorn should use Gyro Ball turn one, and it should use either Power Whip or Leech Seed next turn to avoid wasting a turn due to Disable. This guarantees a win against both Encore + Disable and Life Orb variants of Alolan Ninetales. Against Zeraora, Ferrothorn should use Iron Defense on the first turn, which lets it survive the second turn and then KO with Body Press due to Close Combat Defense drops. If you believe your opponent is running a defensive Urshifu-R, use Iron Defense on the first turn to not get KOed by Body Press. However, if you suspect Urshifu-R is offensive, use Power Whip on the first turn instead to OHKO it after Close Combat. Be mindful that some Pokemon may run Fire-type coverage for Ferrothorn's 4x weakness to deal with it, such as Zeraora, Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Dracozolt.</p>"

      "Custap Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Endure + Custap Berry allows Ferrothorn to survive a hit that would KO and move first the next turn. Gyro Ball, which is often Ferrothorn's strongest move, helps beat Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Togekiss, and Sylveon. Payback helps Ferrothorn beat Pokemon like non-Choice Specs Magnezone, Metagross, and Trick + Choice Scarf Cresselia. Revenge helps the Magnezone matchup and helps Ferrothorn beat Aggron. Leech Seed solidifies the Aromatisse and Regidrago matchups by allowing Ferrothorn to survive longer and set up further Swords Dances.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>240 HP EVs, 52 Defense EVs, and a Relaxed nature allow Ferrothorn to survive Fire Fang from Choice Band Garchomp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If a Pokemon's attack will bring Ferrothorn to 25% or less health, it can set up a Swords Dance on the first turn and use its Custap Berry to move first on the next turn. This strategy can be used against Zeraora, Landorus without Protect, and Rillaboom. Against potential Encore users, Ferrothorn should use a damaging move to avoid being locked into Swords Dance or Endure. Against Choice Scarf Togekiss, usually use Endure the first turn to predict their Fire-type coverage and then Gyro Ball on the second turn. However, Togekiss can also use Trick or Encore on the first turn. To avoid this, Ferrothorn can use Gyro Ball on the first turn. Against Alolan Ninetales, Ferrothorn should use Gyro Ball into Power Whip to prevent Disable and Encore from forcing it to use Struggle. Against Aromatisse, Ferrothorn should use Leech Seed on the first turn due to Gyro Ball’s low damage output; due to its HP investment, it can beat Aromatisse even after Aromatisse locks it into Leech Seed or makes it use Struggle. Custap Berry Ferrothorn can beat Choice Band Garchomp by clicking Swords Dance into Gyro Ball, and it beats Regidrago by using Gyro Ball first to avoid being OHKOed by a combination of Dragon Energy and Draco Meteor.</p>"

Hyper Voice is a good move against frail Pokemon like Regieleki, common Substitute users like Dragapult and Whimsicott, and common Endure users like Garchomp. Hyper Beam OHKOes neutral targets like physically defensive Aromatisse and Landorus. Echoed Voice beats Substitute Zapdos variants lacking Eerie Impulse, as well as certain specially bulky Trick Cresselia sets. Mystical Fire is a coverage option that beats Ferrothorn. Psyshock handles Power Herb Nihilego, and Draining Kiss has niche usage against Kommo-o, which can block all of Sylveon's other moves with Substitute and Soundproof, as well as Custap Berry and Choice Scarf variants of Sawk, which cannot 2HKO Sylveon after it heals.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The HP EVs allow Sylveon to tank Choice Specs Landorus's Sludge Wave. Special Attack is maxed out to grant the best possible chances against targets like Assault Vest Goodra, Landorus, and non-Psychic Seed Tapu Lele. The Speed investment allows Sylveon to always outpace Adamant Rhyperior. The remainder is put in Defense for the best survival odds against Choice Band Garchomp's Earthquake.</p> <p>Alternatively, Sylveon can run a bulky spread of 224 HP / 148 SpA / 136 SpD with a Calm nature. This allows it to tank Adamant Choice Band Dragapult's Phantom Force, as well as Choice Specs Naganadel's Sludge Wave. If ran alongside Psyshock, it notably allows Sylveon to tank a hit from any Nihilego set and OHKO it back.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In general, Choice Specs Sylveon has a simple gameplan: use Hyper Voice. Hyper Beam should be used against Pokemon which have the potential to KO Sylveon before it can attack a second time, such as Azumarill, Goodra, and Landorus-T. The remaining moves are very situational and should not be used outside of their listed matchups.</p> <p>Choice Specs Sylveon commonly finds itself in uncertain matchups against Custap Berry users. Custap Berry Primarina, for instance, beats a Sylveon using Hyper Beam by opening with Endure. However, if Sylveon uses Hyper Voice, Primarina wins by using Moonblast followed by Endure then KOing with a Torrent-boosted Hydro Cannon.

Hyper Beam OHKOes the aforementioned Pokemon and helps against Goodra and Aromatisse. Hyper Voice is useful against Substitute users like Dragapult and Whimsicott and Sturdy Pokemon like Crustle and Sawk, while Fake Tears offers an anti-stall tool to be used against Sap Sipper Azumarill, defensive Chansey, and Cresselia sets without Trick or Skill Swap.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack allows for optimal odds against Trick Togekiss and Tapu Koko. The Defense EVs allow Sylveon to always survive Adamant Life Orb Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. The remainder of the EVs are put in Speed to try and outspeed other base 60s, like Primarina and opposing Sylveon, as well as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Broadly speaking, Sylveon should use Hyper Voice or Fake Tears on turns it's not at risk of getting OHKOed, and it should go for Endure followed by Hyper Beam on turns where it is. However, against Pokemon with priority moves, like Azumarill and Urshifu-R, it is not possible to safely drop to 1 HP. Sylveon should also beware of using Hyper Beam on Endure from Pokemon like Tyranitar and Rhyperior; instead, it should use Fake Tears if you predict Endure. Unlike most Custap Berry users, Sylveon should use Endure turn one against Regieleki, as it will always survive and consume its Custap Berry next turn, whereas attacking runs the risk of fainting to Electro Ball. While Sylveon beats most Choice-locked Dragon types, it loses to Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt, as their signature moves' power is less on turns where Sylveon uses Endure, and it is consequently not put into Custap Berry range. The optimal play in these matchups is to use Endure twice in a row, giving Sylveon a 1/3 chance to activate its Custap Berry.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sylveon is the best Yawn user and, in fact, the best sleep inducer in the whole SS 1v1 metagame, as it boasts good bulk, powerful attacks, and potentially a very solid setup move. A Mental Herb allows Sylveon to safely use Yawn versus Taunt and Encore users like Aromatisse, Primarina, Spectrier, Togekiss and Gardevoir. Hyper Voice is able to beat Substitute users like Dragapult and Whimsicott, but Hyper Beam's higher damage offers reliability versus Pokemon like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Modest Porygon-Z without a boosting item. Fake Tears notably gives the set a shot at beating Maranga Berry Corviknight, which is otherwise a hard Sylveon counter. The move also helps versus walls like Tapu Koko and Sap Sipper Azumarill.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The HP EVs allow Sylveon to survive Choice Specs Regieleki's Electro Ball. The Defense EVs let it tank Surging Strikes from Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R. The remaining EVs have been put in Special Attack to improve odds versus Pokemon like Primarina and Togekiss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When a foe is on their third sleep turn—thus guaranteed to wake up next turn—and is impossible to KO in a single move, it is usually advantageous for Sylveon to re-apply Yawn's drowsiness—using Protect against slower foes so that they can wake up—as this yields several additional turns.</p> <p>Beware of Pokemon potentially carrying Trick, like Togekiss, Porygon-Z, Cresselia, and Telepathy Tapu Fini, and do not use Yawn or Fake Tears against an unknown set. Protect may be used to scout for this eventuality, though at the risk of being set up on—it is often safer to simply attack.</p> <p>Note that Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain and Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain both prevent sleep, making Yawn a waste of a turn against these Pokemon. Likewise, Yawn should not be used against Porygon-Z, as that Pokemon commonly runs Uproar. Finally, both Urshifu formes ignore Protect with their ability. Do not use Yawn against these Pokemon, as there is no guarantee Sylveon will be able to survive until the foe falls asleep.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Defensive Grassy Seed": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Grassy Seed, Grassy Surge, and Tapu Bulu's highly competitive typing allows it to defeat common physical attackers like both Urshifu formes, Azumarill, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Zeraora. Wood Hammer allows Tapu Bulu to defeat Water-types like Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Huge Power Azumarill while also dealing a good amount of damage to neutral targets such as Zeraora thanks to the boost from Grassy Surge. Horn Leech helps in matchups where the provided recovery makes a difference, such as Custap Berry Sawk and some Glastrier sets, although Wood Hammer is a better option to secure rolls such as OHKOing Choice Band Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Tapu Fini. Disable helps against threatening Choice item attackers such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Landorus-T. Leech Seed and Synthesis provide reliable recovery; Leech Seed combined with Wood Hammer allows Tapu Bulu to have a better matchup against Aromatisse, while Synthesis is another option that works well with Disable against foes like non-Choice Scarf Metagross. In the final moveslot, Taunt prevents stall Pokemon like Chansey from using Toxic, and Dazzling Gleam completely shatters Urshifu-S. The combination of Taunt + Disable allows Tapu Bulu to secure the win against common stall threats like Kee Berry Cresselia and Sap Sipper Azumarill, the latter of which is commonly used to defeat Grass-types. Bulk Up boosts allow Tapu Bulu to defeat Custap Berry Aggron and, in conjunction with Taunt, break through bulky Pokemon like opposing Tapu Bulu.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Defense and HP investments allow Tapu Bulu to survive Choice Band Aggron's Heavy Slam. 56 Speed EVs is important to let Tapu Bulu outspeed Adamant Choice Band Aggron and Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set serves a diverse role in the metagame; for example, it is able to defeat stall Pokemon like Kee Berry and non-Icy Wind Leftovers Cresselia with the combination of using Taunt on the first turn and then using Disable on the only attack Cresselia has, forcing it to use Struggle. Tapu Bulu is also reliable against physical attackers that can't tank multiple Wood Hammer boosted by Grassy Surge, such as Zeraora, while its typing allows it to secure the win against threats like Urshifu-R and Rhyperior. However, there are a few matchups that are not straightforward: Against Crustle, opening with Leech Seed negates its Sturdy ability, ensuring that a follow-up Wood Hammer secures the KO; since Crustle doesn't survive Wood Hammer after using Shell Smash, this sequence guarantees the win. Against Chansey, you should be aware of Counter and Toxic, so Tapu Bulu should use Taunt on the first turn and then Leech Seed + Disable on the Seismic Toss, only clicking Wood Hammer when Chansey is in KO range to avoid Counter. Disable can be used to defeat Choice Band Arcanine and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, as the Grassy Seed boost and the EVs in Defense allow Tapu Bulu to tank a Flare Blitz and Icicle Crash, respectively. Using Disable the first turn, followed by a recovery move like Leech Seed or Synthesis, allows Tapu Bulu to win both matchups via forcing them to use Struggle. Tapu Bulu defeats most Urshifu-S sets with Dazzling Gleam. In the case of not running Dazzling Gleam, be aware that Choiced Urshifu-S could lure Tapu Bulu in with Poison Jab, which 2HKOes it. Therefore, if you suspect this kind of lure, use Disable on the first turn to secure the win. Choice Scarf Haxorus also threatens Tapu Bulu with Poison Jab, so Disable on the first turn is the right move in this matchup too. Against Azumarill, Tapu Bulu can safely use Wood Hammer on the first turn, and if it's Sap Sipper, Tapu Bulu wins by using the combination of Taunt + Disable. Tapu Bulu can defeat Aromatisse if running Leech Seed, as it secures the win by using Wood Hammer turn one and Leech Seed turn two.</p>"

Leech Seed alongside Grassy Surge provides Tapu Bulu with reliable recovery, draining health from bulky foes that are not threatened by Tapu Bulu's STAB move, such as Registeel. Leech Seed + Wood Hammer allows Tapu Bulu to defeat Aromatisse. Substitute synergizes well with Leech Seed, as this combination allows Tapu Bulu to defeat slower Pokemon like Assault Vest Registeel. Wood Hammer OHKOes Water-type foes like Primarina and non-stall Azumarill, as well as dealing a decent amount of damage to neutral targets like Urshifu-S and Dracovish thanks to Grassy Surge.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Running 160 HP EVs helps Tapu Bulu tank any attack from Choice Specs Tapu Fini, while 28 Defense EVs allow Tapu Bulu to easily survive Blaze Kick from Choice Band Zeraora and Poison Jab from both Choice Scarf Urshifu-S and Choice Scarf Haxorus. The Speed EVs help Tapu Bulu outrun Magnezone and Celesteela.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The primary goal of this set is to effectively utilize Substitute + Disable to block and neutralize incoming attacks from slower foes that would otherwise threaten Tapu Bulu with overwhelming damage. Tapu Bulu should use Substitute on the first turn against Magnezone using Flash Cannon, followed by Disable and Leech Seed to secure the win. Substitute on the first two turns is a safe option to scout Magnezone's set if you are not sure about it being Choice Specs, as Metal Sound Magnezone can defeat Tapu Bulu. The same sequence applies to matchups like Choice Band Steelix and Choice Band Aggron. Against faster threats like Choice Scarf Haxorus running Poison Jab, Tapu Bulu should use Disable first and Leech Seed the turn after. Tapu Bulu secures the win against Assault Vest Registeel by using Leech Seed on the first turn, Substitute until it can't use Substitute anymore due to low HP, and then Wood Hammer; the damage on the final turn is enough thanks to Leech Seed wearing Registeel down.</p>"

However, with a Mental Herb, Celesteela can lure one of its most powerful hard counters, using Leech Seed to get around Endure and Heavy Slam to 2HKO Primarina. Flamethrower helps against Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Metagross, and Protect grants extra turns of Leech Seed recovery, which comes in handy against Haxorus and Choice Specs Landorus.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Attack, HP, and Defense EVs allow Celesteela to survive any two attacks from Haxorus, including Adamant Choice Band Low Kick, and beat it by clicking Leech Seed, Protect, Heavy Slam, and then Protect again. The Special Defense EVs do the same for two Focus Blasts from Choice Specs Landorus. The remaning 16 EVs have been placed in Speed for the best chance to outspeed Primarina.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Versus Primarina, use Leech Seed followed by Heavy Slam. Using Heavy Slam twice risks putting a faster Primarina in Torrent range while taking significant chip damage from Moonblast, while using Heavy Slam followed by Leech Seed can be punished by a faster set with Encore. The only problem for this strategy is posed by Sitrus Berry sets, which can survive two rounds of Leech Seed damage and two Heavy Slams to wind up in Torrent range. If Primarina is slower, stalling out two extra turns with Protect prevents this from happening, but caution should be taken that Primarina does not use Calm Mind during those turns. Make sure to use Protect whenever a Primarina with an unknown item ends up below 25% HP, to play around a potential Custap Berry.</p> <p>Generally, Celesteela should use Leech Seed on the first turn of combat, then alternate Protect with attacks. This maximizes Leech Seed drain and thus recovery. Thanks to Celesteela's Mental Herb, this strategy is viable even against Taunt users like Galarian Moltres.

  "Dragapult": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band Dragapult can exchange Dragon Darts for Breaking Swipe, which, paired with an EV spread of 116 Atk / 156 Def / 236 Spe, allows Dragapult to secure the Crustle matchup.  This also makes Dragapult more reliable versus Arcanine, since Dragapult can sometimes survive an Outrage from maximum Attack Arcanine, allowing Dragapult to KO back with Outrage. The Speed investment allows Dragapult to outspeed Adamant Crustle at +2, so it can use Breaking Swipe freely. However, Choice Band Crustle can still win, so be careful.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp + Hex Dragapult can switch out Weakness Policy for Sitrus Berry to give it more reliability against Avalugg, although this is not often recommended, as this severely weakens the Landorus-T matchup, especially Assault Vest variants. It is also possible to exchange Substitute / Protect or Disable for Draco Meteor or other coverage moves to fit the specific needs of the team.</p> <p>By far the most common variation on Will-O-Wisp + Hex Dragapult uses Dragon Dance + Outrage instead of Disable to catch Zeraora off guard. With an EV spread of 176 HP / 24 Atk / 252 Def / 56 Spe and an Impish nature, Dragapult can survive Jolly Zeraora's Choice Band Outrage and OHKO it with Outrage at +3. The Speed investment allows Dragapult to outspeed Garchomp at +0 and Regieleki at +1.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Dragapult with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 16 SpD / 240 Spe, a Modest nature, Fire Blast, and Draco Meteor lures in checks to other sets such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Choice Scarf Haxorus and OHKOes them. However, the limitations of the Choice Scarf without additional boosts make this set lackluster overall.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Dragapult hits foes hard with Phantom Force and Outrage. Phantom Force beats Spectrier, most Metagross, and most Cresselia. Outrage threatens slower Dragon-types such as Naganadel and non-Choice Scarf Haxorus and Pokemon that can't OHKO Dragapult like Volcanion, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona. Dragon Darts allows Dragapult to bypass Haban Berry users such as Garchomp. Fire Blast beats Kartana and non-Custap Berry Ferrothorn, while U-turn beats Zarude. Clear Body gives Dragapult the edge against Intimidate + Bulldoze Arcanine and Bulldoze Entei, while Infiltrator makes Dragapult reliable versus SubSeed users such as Whimsicott and Venusaur.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The given EV spread and an Adamant nature allow Dragapult to outspeed Naganadel and give it the best odds to OHKO Metagross and Landorus-T. 4 Special Defense EVs slightly improve Dragapult's odds to survive an Ice Beam from Modest Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. A Jolly nature is better against other Dragapult and some Zeraora.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against slower Dragon-types, Dragon Darts is usually the superior move because the first hit activates the foe's Haban Berry, allowing the second hit to be full power. Due to the 2 turn nature of Phantom Force, Endure users with priority moves can slowly chip down Dragapult, most notably Endure + Bullet Punch Metagross and Endure + Grassy Glide Rillaboom. Kee Berry + Moonlight Cresselia also wins, since it can out-heal Phantom Force at +1 Defense.</p>"
      },
      "Will-O-Wisp + Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp + Hex Dragapult uses its high Speed and Weakness Policy to beat slower physical attackers. Substitute and Disable allow Dragapult to beat Choice-locked attackers. Additionally, if Dragapult is hit by a super effective move that does not OHKO it, such as Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam, it can fire off a 130-Base Power Hex at +2. The versatility of this set is very appealing: with Will-O-Wisp, Substitute, and Disable, Dragapult can win a lot of unexpected matchups such as against Choice Band Urshifu-S, Avalugg, and non-Lum Berry Landorus-T.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Speed investment allows Dragapult to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt so that it can safely use Substitute against them. The HP and Defense investment give Dragapult the best odds to survive burned Choice Band Avalugg's Icicle Spear.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against most physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Rhyperior, and Aggron, it is safest to use Will-O-Wisp turn 1. This weakens their attacks and allows Dragapult to break Sturdy or play more confidently around a potential Custap Berry on future turns. Using Substitute after Will-O-Wisp racks up burn damage, putting foes into KO range of a boosted Hex. Additionally, when facing the likes of Choice Specs Naganadel, using Substitute + Disable forces the foe to use Struggle. Disable is also helpful if a Pokemon usually only runs one move to hit Dragapult hard, such as Dazzling Gleam Tapu Bulu.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curse Dragapult has a much better matchup versus bulkier Pokemon because Curse does consistent damage over time and Disable denies recovery. Substitute and Phantom Force buy turns for Dragapult to whittle down foes with Curse. Protect also buys extra turns against moves that can bypass Substitute, such as Rhyperior and Crustle's Rock Blast and Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Additionally, having Substitute or Protect + Disable allows Dragapult to retain its matchup versus many Choice item users. Furthermore, many Pokemon may only have one move that can OHKO Dragapult, which can be Disabled to let Curse damage build up. Clear Body is used to help increase Dragapult's reliability against Bulldoze Entei.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Speed investment and a Jolly nature are for outspeeding Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt, while the rest of the EVs are put into Defense for the best chances against the likes of Choice Band Rock Blast Aggron.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 244 HP / 4 Def / 100 SpD / 160 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used as well. The HP EVs make it so that Curse activates Sitrus Berry, so Dragapult can use Substitute five times with Sitrus Berry's recovery. 160 Speed EVs and a boosting nature allow Dragapult to outspeed Spectrier. The Special Defense investment almost always allows Dragapult to survive Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon after Curse and Sitrus Berry. The final 4 EVs are put into Defense to marginally help with Rock Blast from Aggron or Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Curse Dragapult has many unintuitive matchups due in large part to its flexibility and varied lines of play that Substitute, Disable, and Curse afford it.</p> <p>For example, against Magnezone, Dragapult should use Curse turn 1. If Flash Cannon does about 65%, it is Choice Specs Magnezone. Dragapult should then use Disable followed by Phantom Force. Otherwise, Dragapult should use Substitute followed by Phantom Force.</p> <p>Against Entei, it is important to pay attention to its ability. If Entei reveals Pressure, this indicates Pressure stall Entei, which means Dragapult should use Substitute turn 1 followed up by Curse because Pressure stall Entei does not often run moves that can break past its Substitute. However, if no ability is revealed, this indicates Assault Vest Entei, which means that Dragapult should use Curse turn 1 followed by Substitute, Disable, and Phantom Force.</p> <p>Against Aggron, Dragapult should use Substitute turn 1 followed by Disable to force Choice Band Aggron to use Struggle. On turn 3, Dragapult should use Substitute followed by two Phantom Forces, although this makes Aggron not take Struggle recoil during recharge turns.</p> <p>Finally, Curse Dragapult does run into some mind games versus certain Pokemon like Spectrier. Turn 1 is fairly straightforward: Spectrier will reveal Hex or Shadow Ball, and Dragapult should use Substitute. Next, Dragapult can either use Disable to win if the opponent uses Hex again or use Substitute again turn 2 as Spectrier uses Taunt, which will win with Phantom Force. Neither turn 2 play is clearly better.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult uses its good offensive typing, good coverage, and amazing Speed to hit as much of the tier as possible super effectively. Shadow Ball solidifies its otherwise surprisingly shaky matchups versus Psychic-types like Cresselia and non-Assault Vest Metagross. Draco Meteor OHKOes non-Choice Scarf Haxorus, Naganadel, non-Assault Vest Urshifu-R and Urshifu-S, Zarude, and Porygon-Z.  Fire Blast or Flamethrower allow Dragapult to have a super effective move against Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Choice Specs Magnezone. Fire Blast's additional Base Power greatly improves the Tapu Bulu matchup, but Flamethrower can be run for better reliability versus Ferrothorn. Finally, Hydro Pump gives Dragapult the ability to beat Pokemon such as Heatran and some Rhyperior. Infiltrator is the preferred ability in order to be reliable versus SubSeed users such as Whimsicott and Venusaur and helps against Substitute + Protect users such as Entei.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>4 Special Defense EVs help with the Choice Specs Magnezone matchup. A Modest nature is generally preferred, as even with Choice Specs and high Base Power moves, Dragapult's only average Special Attack can lead it to come up short against the likes of Tapu Bulu. However, a Timid nature can be ran to outspeed Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish as well as Speed tie with other Dragapult.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult is fairly straightforward. However, it is important to note that similar to many other Choice item users, Dragapult can be susceptible to Custap Berry users such as Garchomp and Dracovish. Additionally, resistance Berries are a threat to this Dragapult set in particular, notably Haban Berry Dragon-types, as Draco Meteor is often not strong enough to KO them through Haban Berry.</p>"

Superpower is used instead of Close Combat to avoid the Special Defense drop, which would make Urshifu-S lose to Chople Berry Porygon-Z. Stone Edge lets Urshifu-S beat Volcarona and Volcanion. Poison Jab can be used instead to beat most Tapu Bulu sets as well as non-Kebia Berry Whimsicott with Moonblast. Ice Punch could also be considered, as it helps Urshifu-S beat Garchomp consistently.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>128 HP and 116 Special Defense EVs allow Urshifu-S to survive Thunder from Choice Specs Regieleki, Hyper Beam from Modest Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Close Combat from Adamant Choice Scarf Haxorus.

This keeps the same matchups against Regieleki and Porygon-Z, but it can only survive Close Combat from Jolly Scarf Haxorus instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against Substitute + Disable Dragapult and Will-O-Wisp + Disable Spectrier sets, you should use Sucker Punch after an initial Wicked Blow to avoid Wicked Blow being disabled.

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Bulky Chople Berry Urshifu-S beats Galarian Darmanitan, a Pokemon Urshifu-S normally struggles against, all while gaining new positive matchups with its massive bulk investment. Bulk Up allows Urshifu-S to perform its usual stallbreaking duties, easily dealing with Galarian Corsola, Chansey, Corviknight, and Registeel while granting extra security in matchups versus Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rhyperior. Counter gives Urshifu-S the option to play defensively as an offensive Pokemon, easily tanking attacks such as Choice Band Pheromosa's High Jump Kick, Adamant Choice Scarf Haxorus's Close Combat —even if Unnerve prevents the Berry from being eaten— and Assault Vest Arcanine's Play Rough, delivering a devastating Counter afterwards.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Defense and HP investment allows Urshifu-S to survive Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan's Giga Impact, with all remaining EVs going into Attack. An alternative spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature and the moves Wicked Blow / Close Combat / Sucker Punch / Bulk Up can be used instead for a more reliable matchup against opposing Urshifu, Sawk, and non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wicked Blow is an excellent move to use on Pokemon that can't be hit super effectively otherwise, in addition to dealing heavy damage to Sturdy users like Magnezone, Aggron, and Crustle, matchups where using Close Combat could lose. Close Combat should be used on Pokemon that Urshifu-S OHKOes with it, most notably Tyranitar. Sucker Punch is a good way to secure a win against opposing Custap Berry users and can force foes like non-Choice Specs Volcarona into terrifying coinflip scenarios. Bulk Up is used for general stallbreaking and making matchups easier to approach, in particular beating Pokemon that rely on Counter to win, such as Chansey, Rhyperior, and Swampert. Counter can be used instead to more reliably win matchups against Choice Band Pheromosa, Choice Scarf users like Haxorus, Play Rough Arcanine, Dracovish, and Life Orb Rillaboom. It is is worth noting that certain Dragapult sets may be running Substitute + Disable; thus, it is advisable to use Sucker Punch after using Wicked Blow to avoid Wicked Blow being disabled.</p>"

      "Custap Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Custap Berry Urshifu-S's purpose is, generally speaking, a lure set to catch players off guard. Its main allure is turning many unwinnable matchups into coinflips, such as Choice Band Zeraora with Play Rough, Porygon-Z, and Celesteela. While giving up Sucker Punch can be detrimental, the addition of an extremely strong Reversal benefits Urshifu-S greatly, OHKOing many threats at maximum power like Zeraora, Regidrago, Volcanion, most Celesteela, and Garchomp. Endure is an absolute staple on all Custap Berry sets in 1v1 for its ability to guarantee the Berry's activation.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Special Defense EVs in conjunction with 168 HP EVs allow Urshifu-S to survive Air Slash from non-Choice Specs Celesteela while the HP lets it survive Choice Scarf Dracovish's Fishious Rend. The Speed investment has Urshifu-S outpace Adamant base 75 Speed Pokemon such as Dracovish and Dracozolt. All extra EVs go into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, you will want to use Endure on incoming big hits, such as Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Dragapult, Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z, and Superpower or Giga Impact from Galarian Darmanitan. Urshifu-S has a massive advantage in that the only way for foes to prevent the Custap Berry's activation is with priority or their own Endure, since Urshifu-S's ability, Unseen Fist, allows it to bypass all forms of protection. Thus, it breaks through Pokemon such as Life Orb Kartana and Life Orb Dracovish, which carry Protect for other Custap Berry users. Bulk Up secures core matchups such as Assault Vest Swampert, Registeel, Corviknight, Rhyperior, and Steelix, among others. Substitute + Disable Dragapult sets can attempt to neutralize Wicked Blow, which should be countered by using Endure on turn 2.</p>"

Ice Punch can be used to defeat unusually bulky variants of Garchomp.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment is used to outrun base 80 Speed Pokemon at minimum, such as Venusaur and Regidrago.

For Regieleki, use Sucker Punch to OHKO most variants. Use Fling if your opponent has a Dragapult and you suspect it is a Substitute + Disable variant; Fling may also be used versus Sturdy Pokemon such as Magnezone, Aggron, and Crustle.

Choice Scarf Urshifu-S has a nice amount of variety in its final two moveslots; as a third move, Fire Punch melts Ferrothorn and Pheromosa, but Fling can be used instead in matchups where not being Choice-locked would be very helpful, such as against Corviknight and Registeel. Fling is best used with Bulk Up in the last moveslot since it retains Urshifu-S's immensely useful ability to break stall Pokemon.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sitrus Berry + Taunt can run an alternative spread of 240 HP / 232 Def / 4 SpA / 32 Spe with a Timid nature and the moves Will-O-Wisp / Hex / Taunt / Calm Mind or Haze to reliably beat Galarian Darmanitan, Garchomp, and Rillaboom, surviving 2 Grassy Glide and a Knock Off from a burned +2 Rillaboom while outrunning Jolly Garchomp. Calm Mind is a generally better move, while Haze reliably beats Rillaboom.</p>",

      "Sitrus Berry + Taunt": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spectrier has an excellent niche in 1v1 as a setup Pokemon that can easily beat other setup Pokemon using Will-O-Wisp, Calm Mind, and Taunt. Spectrier's usage as a very potent two-turn nuke is applicable, being able to deal with Pokemon such as Aggron, Magnezone, and Naganadel. With Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp, Spectrier can easily deal with Pokemon that rely on one type of attack, burning physical attackers like Galarian Darmanitan, Haxorus, and Aggron while boosting its Special Defense in front of special attackers like Landorus. Taunt is used to shut down stall Pokemon such as Registeel, Chansey, and Cresselia. Hex pairs very well with Will-O-Wisp thanks to burn doubling Hex's Base Power, but Shadow Ball provides consistent damage versus Pokemon immune to burn, like Heatran, Volcanion, and Misty Surge Tapu Fini. Shadow Ball is also more consistent because it does not rely on Will-O-Wisp, since it is inaccurate and is shut down by Trick users like Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Togekiss.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>184 HP EVs combines with 24 Special Defense EVs for Spectrier to survive two Earth Powers from Timid Choice Specs Landorus after a Calm Mind boost, and 52 Defense EVs allow it to survive two Outrage from Jolly Choice Band Garchomp. 184 Speed EVs allow Spectrier to outrun Timid Naganadel. All remaining EVs go into Special Attack for better damage rolls against Galarian Darmanitan and Haxorus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spectrier's most basic sequence is Will-O-Wisp turn 1 into Hex turn 2. However, sometimes Will-O-Wisp is just too risky, such as when facing Nasty Plot Life Orb Naganadel. Aside from move choice, Spectrier is very straightforward to use. Thanks to its excellent natural special bulk, it often doesn't need to use Calm Mind in front of other special attackers. Exceptions include using Calm Mind when facing opposing setup, such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and using Calm Mind to make matchups against Magnezone and Naganadel more reliable. Taunt defeats stall Cresselia by denying its Moonlight recovery and Calm Mind boosts while shutting down Chansey and Registeel hard, since they can't hit Spectrier with their attacks. Versus Chansey, use Taunt and then Will-O-Wisp so that burn damage will eventually KO it.</p>"

      "Sitrus Berry + Disable": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Disable Spectrier matches up superbly against Choice item users and forgoes the nuclear power of a turn 2 Hex for consistency versus hard-hitting Pokemon like Choice Specs Sylveon, Haxorus, Landorus-T, and Tapu Lele. Disable is incredible in its ability to instantaneously win games if it faces a Choice-locked Pokemon, like Choice Band Landorus-T or Choice Specs Sylveon. The choice between Will-O-Wisp and Substitute depends on how much reliability is needed beating physical attackers with multi-hit moves such as Rhyperior and Crustle, as well as opposing Choice Scarf users like Haxorus, versus how much reliability is needed against  Choice-locked Pokemon that don't run multi-hit moves such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Pokemon that rely on stat debuffs from Acid Spray to win like Goodra and Nihilego.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>240 HP EVs with 16 Special Defense EVs allow Spectrier to survive a Hyper Beam from Choice Specs Sylveon, in addition to giving as much physical bulk as possible for opposing Struggle. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature is used to Speed tie with opposing maximum Speed Spectrier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp should be used in conjunction with Disable to beat opposing Choice-locked physical attackers, like Haxorus, Rhyperior, Avalugg, and Choice Band Dracovish. Substitute is also useful alongside Disable to defeat Choice Band users not running multi-hit moves, as well as some Trick users like Choice Scarf Metagross.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Specs Spectrier, also called \"Specstrier\", is a simple set. High Special Attack and solid neutral coverage allow it to mow through many Pokemon. Uproar defeats Whimsicott, Mud Shot destroys Heatran and Nihilego, and Hyper Beam obliterates most Rillaboom and Urshifu-R.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>120 HP EVs allows Spectrier to survive a Life Orb Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, while the Special Defense EVs grant it the ability to survive Nihilego's Meteor Beam. 132 Speed EVs outruns base 100 Pokemon like Entei and Galarian Zapdos.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use the super effective move. Uproar in particular helps versus Whimsicott, while Mud Shot beats Nihilego and Heatran lacking Choice Scarf. Hyper Beam OHKOes several neutral targets where Shadow Ball may not be enough, like most Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Volcanion. Choosing between using Shadow Ball or Hyper Beam is a matter of whether Spectrier needs to avoid the recharge turn or not. Generally, Choice Specs Spectrier does well against teams that use Pokemon with low Special Defense to defeat Spectrier, like most Rillaboom and frail Urshifu variants.</p>"
      },
      "Weakness Policy": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spectrier's weakness to Zeraora is patched up quite nicely with its Weakness Policy set. Calm Mind can be used to offer more reliability versus hard-hitting special attackers such as Magnezone, but Disable provides the opportunity to win matchups against slower Choice Band users, like Galarian Darmanitan and Dracovish, that may not get OHKOed by a double damage Hex. Mud Shot deals solid damage after a +2 boost, 2HKOing even Assault Vest Zeraora while also dealing with all Heatran sets except Air Balloon, which loses to Hex into Mud Shot instead. Weakness Policy is also handy versus common Knock Off users, like Assault Vest Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Sawk.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The HP and Defense EVs let Spectrier survive a Knock Off from Choice Band Zeraora, while the Speed EVs let it outpace Jolly Kartana. All remaining EVs go into Special Attack for better damage rolls against Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weakness Policy's activation lets Spectrier easily turn the tables on a would-be counter in Zeraora. Defeating Zeraora is as simple as using Mud Shot twice. Outside of this, however, the main gameplan is to use Will-O-Wisp turn 1 so that Hex turn 2 deals double damage, which reliably defeats numerous physical attackers, such as Metagross, Kartana, Urshifu-R, and Rhyperior. If running Calm Mind, it should be used against threats such as Kyurem and Volcanion, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB attacks; otherwise, if using Disable, utilize it to shut down opposing Choice-locked foes.</p>"
