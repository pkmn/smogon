        "description": "<p>Chansey is one of the bulkier walls by virtue of high HP and Eviolite, walling many prominent special attackers such as Primarina, Magnezone, and Volcanion. Toxic helps dispatch threats that can heal up on Chansey such as defensive Arcanine, Roost Kyurem, and non-Rest Togekiss. Soft-Boiled helps to keep Chansey at high HP while slowly whittling down the foe with the combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic. While Chansey's physical bulk is not nearly as good as its special bulk, the given EV investment allows for its to be as physically bulky as possible, giving it the best chance to survive a hit from Choice item Haxorus, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and non-Swords Dance Landorus-Therian, to OHKO them with Counter. Charm is an option over Counter to handle physical attackers that would like to set up on Chansey such as Shell Smash Crustle, Swords Dance Landorus-Therian, and non-Taunt Bulk Up Zeraora. Charm should be used to PP stall and negate boosts from the foe's setup moves to a point where any combination of Chansey's moves will win. Do note that replacing Counter with Charm usually results in losing matchups against Choice Band users such as Landorus-Therian and Choice Band Zeraora, which can 2HKO Chansey through Charm.</p> <p>Chansey is taken advantage of by Choice item attackers with Trick such as Cresselia, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Fini. Toxic can assist in dealing certain anti-stall measures such as Encore and Trick Togekiss and some Fake Tears Sylveon. Versus Sylveon it is optimal to use Toxic on the first turn, then Seismic Toss, then Soft-Boiled, and finally Seismic Toss to avoid being KOed by Hyper Beam at -6. Good teammates for Chansey are attackers that don't care about Trick and are able to retaliate, such as Assault Vest or Choice item Metagross and Aromatisse. Chansey also doesn't appreciate faster Taunt users such as Spectrier and Corviknight, as they PP stall Chansey and slowly chip it down. Good partners that alleviate this weakness include Choice Scarf Galarian Darminatan and Zeraora.</p>"

Minimizing Azumarill's Attack helps to lower confusion self-damage, which slightly improves the matchup against foes like Galarian Moltres.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against Tapu Fini, Azumarill should use Amnesia once and then repeatedly use Seismic Toss. This takes advantage of Tapu Fini's tendency to Iron Defense immediately against Azumarill. By boosting its Special Defense, Azumarill lowers the healing Tapu Fini gets from Draining Kiss, so it cannot outheal Azumarill's Seismic Toss. When facing Entei, you should continuously use Seismic Toss to beat it reliably. When using Icy Wind against Aggron, Azumarill should use Icy Wind turn 1. If Aggron uses Head Smash, Rest should be used until the foe faints from recoil damage.

      "Weakness Policy": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Weakness Policy is beneficial for Kartana, opposing Metagross, and Zeraora. Meteor Mash hits neutral targets like Haxorus and Regidrago hard. Bullet Punch finishes off weakened foes and Custap Berry users such as Sylveon and Magnezone. Earthquake hits Steel- and Electric-types like Regieleki and Carracosta. Psychic may seem like an odd choice, but it helps versus a few foes that Zen Headbutt wouldn't beat, such as Counter Sawk, Iron Defense Urshifu-R, Kartana, and Avalugg. Endure helps against Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Dragapult. Weakness Policy surprises many Pokemon that Metagross can tank supereffective hits from and KO back, such as Assault Vest Entei and Choice Band Steelix.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>248 HP EVs and 28 Defense EVs ensure that Metagross beats Haxorus. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to reliably beat all Regidrago sets. Metagross can run 8 Speed IVs to still outspeed Azumarill and have a better chance at activating Weakness Policy against Incineroar or some variants of Tyranitar, and it can even run 0 Speed IVs for a better opposing Metagross matchup. However, Metagross will lose reliably versus Primarina with less Speed investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against Crustle you should use Bullet Punch turn 1 because it can use Counter, and then KO it with Meteor Mash the next turn. Against Encore + Disable users like Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, and Aromatisse, always use Meteor Mash turn 1, and use Bullet Punch turn 2 to avoid being forced to use Struggle. Against Galarian Darmanitan, you should use Endure to survive Flare Blitz and KO back with +2 Bullet Punch. Against Dragapult, you should use Endure on turn 2 if Phantom Force is used, and use Bullet Punch on turns where Phantom Force will not hit. However, other Dragapult sets like Choice Specs will beat you, so be wary of that.</p>"

Bullet Punch beats Galarian Darmanitan and Earthquake beats Zeraora, Magnezone, and some Arcanine and Incineroar sets. Trick beats various stall Pokemon like Cresselia, Galarian Corsola, and Ferrothorn. Ice Punch allows it to KO Garchomp and bulky Regidrago sets, while Zen Headbutt hits offensive Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The HP EVs ensure Metagross survives Custap Berry Dracozolt's Bolt Beak, and the Special Defense EVs allow it to survive Dragon Energy into Draco Meteor from Custap Berry Regidrago. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack for better damage versus Togekiss and Regidrago. However, an alternative spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed neutral-nature base 80 Speed Pokemon, like Regidrago. Here, maximum Attack gives it the best KO odds versus Tyranitar. If you are running these EVs, you should run Thunder Punch as the fourth move for a better Celesteela matchup.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, using the strongest move is the best option. If running Trick, always use it against stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Corviknight. Against Encore + Disable Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, always use Bullet Punch instead of Meteor Mash to avoid getting locked into Struggle. Bullet Punch OHKOes some Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Weavile, and Archeops, so you should always use it to avoid the risk of getting KOed first. Against Zeraora, using Earthquake will always OHKO unless Zeraora uses Knock Off. In that case, you can use Bullet Punch turn 2 to KO it.</p>"

Swords Dance gets past stall Pokemon like Chansey and Galarian Corsola.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>96 HP EVs allow Garchomp to survive Outrage from Life Orb Zeraora, while the 44 Special Defense EVs let it take Steam Eruption from Choice Specs Volcanion. 120 Speed EVs are used to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon like Kommo-o, and 248 Attack EVs allow for better OHKO odds versus Galarian Darmanitan.

Using Endure is the best option against Pokemon that OHKO it, like Galarian Darmanitan, Dragapult and Naganadel. When in Custap Berry range, Outrage will OHKO these targets before they can move.

Life Orb-boosted Earthquake OHKOes Pokemon like Zeraora and Heatran. Scale Shot acts as a secondary boosting move by increasing Garchomp's Speed. It also counters stall Pokemon like Pressure Entei by breaking through Substitute. Poison Jab deals with Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu, whereas Outrage increases reliability versus Zapdos.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The 192 HP EVs secure the matchup versus Choice Specs Magnezone, as Garchomp survives Hyper Beam even after Life Orb recoil, and also assist versus stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Registeel, ensuring that Night Shade and Seismic Toss take five hits to KO. 68 Defense EVs and the HP investment allow Garchomp to survive Outrage from Choice Band Zeraora. The 136 Speed EVs let Garchomp outspeed some faster Pokemon after Scale Shot, most notably Entei and Spectrier, while also outspeeding Pokemon like Dracozolt without the Speed boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When versus Zeraora, use Earthquake, as you survive a Choice Band-boosted Outrage. Use Scale Shot versus Magnezone and other Sturdy users like Crustle to avoid risking Weakness Policy or Counter activation, respectively, and KO with Earthquake on turn 2. Scale Shot can also be used versus faster Pokemon like Entei and Spectrier to outspeed and KO in the following turns. The main use of Swords Dance is to break past passive stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Registeel, as they cannot do enough damage before Garchomp KOes them.

Additionally a Charm + Kee Berry set allows Togekiss to answer slower physical threats such as Metagross, Aggron, Rhyperior, and Glastrier by reducing their attack and healing with Roost, slowly chipping them down with Counter or Air Slash. A Choice Specs set sacrifices some of Togekiss's Speed for more power, being able to break down bulky Pokemon like Volcanion quickly and reliably because you don't need as many flinches. This set can also run Grass Knot as a niche move to catch Pokemon like Rhyperior and Swampert. Nasty Plot is another option that can be used over Encore on Thunder Wave variants. Nasty Plot can help against stall users like Kyurem and Leftovers Gastrodon, if running Encore. Resist Berry sets usually are paired with Counter. Babiri Berry, for example, can lure Pokemon like Metagross or Kartana by surviving a hit and using Counter. It can also run other Berries such as Wacan Berry, Charti Berry, and even Yache Berry for threats such as Choice Band Zeraora, Choice Band Landorus-T, and Galarian Darmanitan respectively.

      "Maranga Berry + Thunder Wave": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Togekiss makes use of tactical RNG manipulation through Serene Grace, Air Slash, and paralysis to immobilize and break down foes. Maranga Berry allows it to more reliably wall many special attackers such as Primarina, Sylveon, and Volcanion. Thunder Wave is useful for speed control in addition to making immobilizing foes more reliable. Roost paired with paralysis allows Togekiss to fish for paralysis turns while recovering, which increases reliability even more. Encore is useful for locking stall Pokemon such as stall Cresselia and Corsola-G into their setup moves, as well as bulky offensive setup Pokemon like Galarian Moltres, Primarina, and Fake Tears Sylveon by locking them into their status moves.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The EVs allow Togekiss to survive Choice Specs Pixilate Sylveon's Hyper Beam and outspeed Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Adamant Choice Scarf Haxorus after Thunder Wave. 52 Defense EVs maximize reliability against Assault Vest Arcanine and certain Dracovish sets.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 96 HP / 140 SpA / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Togekiss to defeat Magnezone with Mystical Fire. The EV spread allows Togekiss to defeat Choice Specs Volcarona and outspeeds bulky Tapu Fini variants as well as other Maranga Togekiss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most matchups with Maranga Berry Togekiss begin with Togekiss using Thunder Wave Turn 1. However, against certain Trick users such as Cresselia and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, it is safest to use Encore Turn 1. This locks you into Encore again but nets you a free move Turn 3 to use Air Slash, which locks you into Air Slash for the final turn of Encore on Turn 4, resetting the cycle. If the foe uses an attacking move Turn 1 and deals less than half of Togekiss's health, it is generally safe to spam Roost and fish for paralysis turns before going for flinches with Air Slash. This keeps Togekiss from dropping to a stray critical hit as well as not risking being caught by priority or some other gimmick such as a surprise Custap Berry user. If the foe uses a setup or status move such as Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Substitute, Togekiss should usually use Encore to lock them into their move so they can safely break them down without needing to deal with flinch and paralysis chances as long as Togekiss outspeeds. Where Togekiss shouldn't use Encore is against Pokemon like Aromatisse. Instead, Togekiss should spam Air Slash in hopes of getting lucky and flinching Aromatisse down without being locked into Struggle by Encore and Disable.</p>"

For coverage moves, Dazzling Gleam reliably takes out threats like Haxorus and Dracozolt, while Fire Blast can be used for Ferrothorn and Kartana.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Togekiss to do as much damage as possible and outspeed as many Pokemon as possible.</p> <p>Alternatively, 16 HP / 236 SpA / 12 SpD / 244 Spe can be used to outspeed Dragapult and survive a Flash Cannon from Aegislash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, this set is pretty simple to use. Use Air Slash when Togekiss needs to flinch a Pokemon like Naganadel or Volcanion that would KO it otherwise. Use Dazzling Gleam or Fire Blast when either of them more reliably wins the matchup such as against Garchomp or Ferrothorn, respectively.

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Galarian Darmanitan uses its great Attack, decent Speed tier, Gorilla Tactics, and Choice Band to OHKO as many opponents as possible before they can move. Either Icicle Crash or Ice Punch can be used; Ice Punch has perfect accuracy, but Icicle Crash has more power, notably securing matchups against Bulk Up Zarude, Rocky Helmet Aromatisse, and physically bulky Tapu Lele. Icicle Crash also has a 30% flinch chance, allowing Galarian Darmanitan to potentially beat Sturdy users and bulkier threats like Crustle and Aromatisse. Giga Impact OHKOes many bulkier Pokemon such as Sylveon and Primarina and even has a chance to OHKO physically defensive Tapu Fini. Flare Blitz does massive damage to Steel-types, notably OHKOing Registeel and non-Occa Berry Celesteela, and also helps Galarian Darmanitan defeat slower Volcarona sets. The last move is usually one of Superpower, Earthquake, or Iron Head. Superpower helps against Tyranitar, Air Balloon Heatran, bulky Kyurem and Chansey, Earthquake beats some Arcanine and Sitrus Berry Volcanion more reliably, and Iron Head reliably beats Aromatisse.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Adamant is usually preferred, as it performs better versus bulkier Pokemon, like Tapu Fini and Aromatisse. The 4 Special Defense EVs block Pokemon with the ability Download, most notably Porygon2, from getting +1 Special Attack.</p> <p>On bulkier spreads, Giga Impact is less valuable, since it lacks the necessary Attack investment to OHKO Tapu Fini. However, it is still valuable versus Sylveon and Primarina.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 88 Atk / 244 Def / 176 Spe outspeeds Rillaboom and survives Celesteela's uninvested Heavy Slam and Life Orb Rillaboom's Fake Out + Grassy Glide.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 8 HP / 116 Atk / 132 SpD / 252 Spe survives Choice Scarf Togekiss's Fire Blast and Choice Specs Tapu Fini's Hydro Pump so that it can KO them with Icicle Crash and two Earthquakes, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Galarian Darmanitan does not have Iron Head, it should use Icicle Crash or Ice Punch against Aromatisse, rather than Giga Impact. Even though Giga Impact has a chance to OHKO, it has better odds to 2HKO with Ice Punch or Icicle Crash + Struggle. Galarian Darmanitan is 2HKOed by Moonblast and Rocky Helmet damage from Aromatisse, which means that if Aromatisse dodges or survives Giga Impact turn 1 and uses Trick Room, it can use Moonblast, disable Giga Impact as it recharges, and use Moonblast again to KO Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>With the defensive spread, use Icicle Crash or Ice Punch versus Celesteela instead of Flare Blitz. This ensures that Celesteela will not KO Galarian Darmanitan afterwards, and the Ice-type moves 2HKO most Celesteela.</p>"

Earthquake is for Nihilego, Entei, and Zeraora. The last move is more variable, depending on the needs of the team; Flare Blitz for a better Celesteela and Metagross matchup, Thrash for Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, Rock Slide for Volcarona, or Lash Out for Spectrier.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Galarian Darmanitan runs maximum Speed and a Speed-boosting nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Pheromosa. The leftover 4 EVs are put into Special Defense so Download users like Porygon2 get an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>An Adamant nature instead of a Jolly nature helps versus Heatran, but loses out on Timid Choice Scarf Kyurem and Porygon-Z, as well as other Galarian Darmanitan.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 160 Atk / 112 Def / 236 Spe and an Adamant nature allows Galarian Darmanitan to survive Jolly Garchomp's Stone Edge and Adamant Garchomp's Outrage, so this spread is fairly reliable versus Choice Scarf and Custap Berry Garchomp.</p> <p>If using Thrash, consider an EV spread of 4 HP / 144 Atk / 104 SpD / 252 Spe to survive Choice Specs Tapu Fini's Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In nearly every matchup, use the move that does the most damage to come out on top.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Icicle Crash and, after activating Zen Mode, Flare Blitz are Galarian Darmanitan's strongest STAB options. In most matchups, Zen Mode is triggered when Galarian Darmanitan uses Endure on an attack that would otherwise OHKO it, activating both Zen Mode and the Salac Berry. To round out this set, Galarian Darmanitan-Z can use Encore to lock opponents into non-damaging moves, such as Endure. Reversal is another option, which can defeat Kyurem and Heatran.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Adamant is the preferred nature, as base 135 Speed and at +1 Speed outspeeds all relevant threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When Galarian Darmanitan-Z can outspeed and OHKO an opponent, such as Venusaur and Ferrothorn, Galarian Darmanitan should just attack turn 1. Other matchups, where Darmanitan is outsped and OHKOed, like versus Pheromosa and Kartana, Galarian Darmanitan should use Endure, activate the Salac Berry, and OHKO the next turn.</p> <p>Note that Galarian Darmanitan-Z is much weaker without Gorilla Tactics, so it does not KO bulkier Pokemon that it normally expects to like Regidrago.</p>"

Make sure you are slower than Regidrago to have White Herb go into effect on Breaking Swipe's Attack drop and not on the Defense and Special Defense drops of Shell Smash. Solar Blade can be used on the Choice Band set to lure Pokemon such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Quagsire.</p>",

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Sturdy and Mental Herb allows Crustle to safely set up against nearly any Pokemon without the threat of Taunt, Encore, or being OHKOed. Sturdy allows Crustle to live at least one hit from Pokemon such as Celesteela, Galarian Darmanitan, Volcanion, Volcarona, Kyurem, and non-Mold Breaker Haxorus, and due to the immense power of Rock Wrecker, they will be OHKOed after a Shell Smash boost. Mental Herb allows Crustle to safely Shell Smash against Encore Aromatisse and Taunt users such as Whimsicott. Rock Blast is used to break past Substitute users such as Entei, Zapdos, or Whimsicott to avoid Rock Wrecker's recharge turn. For the fourth moveslot, Counter is often used to beat Choice item Dracovish, non-Mold Breaker Haxorus, and some Zeraora sets. X-Scissor is occasionally used over Counter to beat Trick Cresselia and Zarude consistently. Lum Berry can be used to consistently beat Yawn Sylveon and can help in the Will-O-Wisp Volcanion matchup.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Crustle to outspeed most of the metagame after a Shell Smash, while maximum Attack gives it the best rolls to OHKO a non-Defense invested Porygon-Z. Mental Herb Crustle can also use a Jolly Nature with the same EVs to outspeed Electric Seed Tapu Koko after a Shell Smash and KO it with Rock Wrecker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crustle's main strategy is to utilize the combination of Sturdy and Shell Smash to set up without being OHKOed, and OHKO back with Rock Wrecker. Crustle can also use the combination of Shell Smash and Rock Blast to break past Substitute Pokemon like Zapdos or Entei. Against Pokemon such as Primarina or Sylveon, which can potentially run Custap Berry, you may want to Shell Smash twice to avoid clicking Rock Wrecker on Endure. It is important to note that due to Crustle's low Speed tier, it will not be able to outspeed Zeraora or Dragapult at +2 Speed.</p>"

Choice Band Crustle has several options for the last move: Heavy Slam consistently beats Aromatisse and Sylveon, X-Scissor is used to beat Zarude and Trick Cresselia, and Counter beats Choice item attackers such as Dracovish, Urshifu-S, and Garchomp.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>232 HP and 24 Def EVs allow Crustle to survive Choice Band Haxorus's Outrage. 29 Speed IVs, along with a Brave Nature allow Crustle to underspeed Aegislash and OHKO its Blade Forme.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Crustle is very straightforward; in nearly every matchup you should use the strongest move, whether it is Rock Wrecker, Heavy Slam, or Earthquake.

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its incredible mixed bulk, Ferrothorn can handle many top-tier threats such as Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Magnezone. Holding a Chople Berry allows it to beat Fighting-types such as Pheromosa, non-Fire Punch Sawk, and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Gyro Ball is typically Ferrothorn's strongest move and helps it deal with Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Tapu Lele and, Diancie. Iron Defense + Body Press allows Ferrothorn to deal with threats such as Zeraora without Blaze Kick and Chansey, increasing both its physical bulk and Body Press's power.</p> <p>For its final moveslot, it can either run Leech Seed or Power Whip. Leech Seed lets you beat Assault Vest and Haban Berry Regidrago, Assault Vest Landorus-T, and Iron Defense Registeel. Power Whip allows Ferrothorn to hit Water-types like Tapu Fini and Primarina.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>248 HP and 52 Defense EVs with a Relaxed nature allow Ferrothorn to survive a Choice Band-boosted Close Combat from Jolly Choice Band Haxorus; 28 Attack EVs ensure that Ferrothorn OHKOes Haxorus after Iron Barbs damage and the Defense drop. The Special Defense EVs are for Custap Berry and Rocky Helmet Porygon-Z,  as well as Gardevoir if Ferrothorn has Leech Seed. 0 Speed IVs is used to maximize the damage of Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Another EV spread is 248 HP / 160 Def / 100 SpD. This bulks a Hyper Beam from Choice Specs Porygon-Z and 2HKOes with Body Press.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Metagross can use Trick to give Ferrothorn a Choice item. To handle this, Ferrothorn should use a damaging move against these Pokemon (removed E accent) turn 1. Against Encore + Disable Alolan Ninetales, Ferrothorn should use Gyro Ball turn one, and it should use either Power Whip or Leech Seed next turn to avoid wasting a turn due to Disable. This guarantees a win against both Encore + Disable and Life Orb variants of Alolan Ninetales. Against Zeraora, Ferrothorn should use Iron Defense on the first turn, which lets it survive the second turn and then KO with Body Press due to Close Combat Defense drops. If you believe your opponent is running a defensive Urshifu-R, use Iron Defense on the first turn to not get KOed by Body Press. However, if you suspect Urshifu-R is offensive, use Power Whip on the first turn instead to OHKO it after Close Combat. Be mindful that some Pokemon may run Fire-type coverage for Ferrothorn's 4x weakness to deal with it, such as Zeraora, Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Dracozolt.</p>"

      "Custap Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Endure + Custap Berry allows Ferrothorn to survive a hit that would KO and move first the next turn. Gyro Ball, which is often Ferrothorn's strongest move, helps beat Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan, Togekiss, and Sylveon. Payback helps Ferrothorn beat Pokemon like non-Choice Specs Magnezone, Metagross, and Trick + Choice Scarf Cresselia. Revenge helps the Magnezone matchup and helps Ferrothorn beat Aggron. Leech Seed solidifies the Aromatisse and Regidrago matchups by allowing Ferrothorn to survive longer and set up further Swords Dances.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>240 HP EVs, 52 Defense EVs, and a Relaxed nature allow Ferrothorn to survive Fire Fang from Choice Band Garchomp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If a Pokemon's attack will bring Ferrothorn to 25% or less health, it can set up a Swords Dance on the first turn and use its Custap Berry to move first on the next turn. This strategy can be used against Zeraora, Landorus without Protect, and Rillaboom. Against potential Encore users, Ferrothorn should use a damaging move to avoid being locked into Swords Dance or Endure. Against Choice Scarf Togekiss, usually use Endure the first turn to predict their Fire-type coverage and then Gyro Ball on the second turn. However, Togekiss can also use Trick or Encore on the first turn. To avoid this, Ferrothorn can use Gyro Ball on the first turn. Against Alolan Ninetales, Ferrothorn should use Gyro Ball into Power Whip to prevent Disable and Encore from forcing it to use Struggle. Against Aromatisse, Ferrothorn should use Leech Seed on the first turn due to Gyro Ball’s low damage output; due to its HP investment, it can beat Aromatisse even after Aromatisse locks it into Leech Seed or makes it use Struggle. Custap Berry Ferrothorn can beat Choice Band Garchomp by clicking Swords Dance into Gyro Ball, and it beats Regidrago by using Gyro Ball first to avoid being OHKOed by a combination of Dragon Energy and Draco Meteor.</p>"

Earthquake is mainly used for Nihilego.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The HP and Defense investment allows Volcanion to survive an Earthquake from Choice Band Avalugg, while the Speed investment allows it to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Porygon-Z, Moltres and Galarian Moltres. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 132 Def / 128 SpA with Earthquake can provide a somewhat reasonable Zeraora matchup.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Endure is almost always the best move turn 1 versus threats that can OHKO Volcanion, like Galarian Darmanitan and Porygon-Z. Then, after activating Custap Berry, it can OHKO back with the appropriate move. Against Avalugg, Volcanion should use a physical move turn 1, breaking Avalugg's Sturdy without letting it land Mirror Coat. Against Venusaur, Volcanion should use Flame Charge turn 1 to reliably beat all of its sets. If the alternate EV spread is used, Volcanion can freely use Earthquake turn 1 against opposing Zeraora. If Zeraora uses Knock Off, then use Earthquake turn 2. If Zeraora uses Plasma Fists turn 1, some prediction is required. Volcanion must use Endure on Plasma Fists or Earthquake on Knock Off. However, if Zeraora's Plasma Fists brings Volcanion below 25%, you can simply use Earthquake turn 2 because Custap Berry will activate.</p>"

In the fast Grassy Seed set, Taunt can be a valuable option for Tapu Bulu to defeat Iron Defense Registeel.</p>",

      "Defensive Grassy Seed": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Grassy Seed, Grassy Surge, and Tapu Bulu's highly competitive typing allows it to defeat common physical attackers like both Urshifu formes, Azumarill, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Zeraora. Wood Hammer allows Tapu Bulu to defeat Water-types like Primarina, Tapu Fini, and Huge Power Azumarill while also dealing a good amount of damage to neutral targets such as Zeraora thanks to the boost from Grassy Surge. Horn Leech helps in matchups where the provided recovery makes a difference, such as Custap Berry Sawk and some Glastrier sets, although Wood Hammer is a better option to secure rolls such as OHKOing Choice Band Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Tapu Fini. Disable helps against threatening Choice item attackers such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Landorus-T. Leech Seed and Synthesis provide reliable recovery; Leech Seed combined with Wood Hammer allows Tapu Bulu to have a better matchup against Aromatisse, while Synthesis is another option that works well with Disable against foes like non-Choice Scarf Metagross. In the final moveslot, Taunt prevents stall Pokemon like Chansey from using Toxic, and Dazzling Gleam completely shatters Urshifu-S. The combination of Taunt + Disable allows Tapu Bulu to secure the win against common stall threats like Kee Berry Cresselia and Sap Sipper Azumarill, the latter of which is commonly used to defeat Grass-types. Bulk Up boosts allow Tapu Bulu to defeat Custap Berry Aggron and, in conjunction with Taunt, break through bulky Pokemon like opposing Tapu Bulu.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Defense and HP investments allow Tapu Bulu to survive Choice Band Aggron's Heavy Slam. 56 Speed EVs is important to let Tapu Bulu outspeed Adamant Choice Band Aggron and Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set serves a diverse role in the metagame; for example, it is able to defeat stall Pokemon like Kee Berry and non-Icy Wind Leftovers Cresselia with the combination of using Taunt on the first turn and then using Disable on the only attack Cresselia has, forcing it to use Struggle. Tapu Bulu is also reliable against physical attackers that can't tank multiple Wood Hammer boosted by Grassy Surge, such as Zeraora, while its typing allows it to secure the win against threats like Urshifu-R and Rhyperior. However, there are a few matchups that are not straightforward: Against Crustle, opening with Leech Seed negates its Sturdy ability, ensuring that a follow-up Wood Hammer secures the KO; since Crustle doesn't survive Wood Hammer after using Shell Smash, this sequence guarantees the win. Against Chansey, you should be aware of Counter and Toxic, so Tapu Bulu should use Taunt on the first turn and then Leech Seed + Disable on the Seismic Toss, only clicking Wood Hammer when Chansey is in KO range to avoid Counter. Disable can be used to defeat Choice Band Arcanine and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, as the Grassy Seed boost and the EVs in Defense allow Tapu Bulu to tank a Flare Blitz and Icicle Crash, respectively. Using Disable the first turn, followed by a recovery move like Leech Seed or Synthesis, allows Tapu Bulu to win both matchups via forcing them to use Struggle. Tapu Bulu defeats most Urshifu-S sets with Dazzling Gleam. In the case of not running Dazzling Gleam, be aware that Choiced Urshifu-S could lure Tapu Bulu in with Poison Jab, which 2HKOes it. Therefore, if you suspect this kind of lure, use Disable on the first turn to secure the win. Choice Scarf Haxorus also threatens Tapu Bulu with Poison Jab, so Disable on the first turn is the right move in this matchup too. Against Azumarill, Tapu Bulu can safely use Wood Hammer on the first turn, and if it's Sap Sipper, Tapu Bulu wins by using the combination of Taunt + Disable. Tapu Bulu can defeat Aromatisse if running Leech Seed, as it secures the win by using Wood Hammer turn one and Leech Seed turn two.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This Tapu Bulu set aims to outspeed and defeat Pokemon that the defensive set struggles against, such as Magnezone and Icy Wind Cresselia, thanks to the combination of Substitute + Disable. Leech Seed alongside Grassy Surge provides Tapu Bulu with reliable recovery, draining health from bulky foes that are not threatened by Tapu Bulu's STAB move, such as Registeel. Leech Seed + Wood Hammer allows Tapu Bulu to defeat Aromatisse. Substitute synergizes well with Leech Seed, as this combination allows Tapu Bulu to defeat slower Pokemon like Assault Vest Registeel. Wood Hammer OHKOes Water-type foes like Primarina and non-stall Azumarill, as well as dealing a decent amount of damage to neutral targets like Urshifu-S and Dracovish thanks to Grassy Surge.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Running 160 HP EVs helps Tapu Bulu tank any attack from Choice Specs Tapu Fini, while 28 Defense EVs allow Tapu Bulu to easily survive Blaze Kick from Choice Band Zeraora and Poison Jab from both Choice Scarf Urshifu-S and Choice Scarf Haxorus. The Speed EVs help Tapu Bulu outrun Magnezone and Celesteela.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The primary goal of this set is to effectively utilize Substitute + Disable to block and neutralize incoming attacks from slower foes that would otherwise threaten Tapu Bulu with overwhelming damage. Tapu Bulu should use Substitute on the first turn against Magnezone using Flash Cannon, followed by Disable and Leech Seed to secure the win. Substitute on the first two turns is a safe option to scout Magnezone's set if you are not sure about it being Choice Specs, as Metal Sound Magnezone can defeat Tapu Bulu. The same sequence applies to matchups like Choice Band Steelix and Choice Band Aggron. Against faster threats like Choice Scarf Haxorus running Poison Jab, Tapu Bulu should use Disable first and Leech Seed the turn after. Tapu Bulu secures the win against Assault Vest Registeel by using Leech Seed on the first turn, Substitute until it can't use Substitute anymore due to low HP, and then Wood Hammer; the damage on the final turn is enough thanks to Leech Seed wearing Registeel down.</p>"

This also makes Dragapult more reliable versus Arcanine, since Dragapult can sometimes survive an Outrage from maximum Attack Arcanine, allowing Dragapult to KO back with Outrage.

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Dragapult hits foes hard with Phantom Force and Outrage. Phantom Force beats Spectrier, most Metagross, and most Cresselia. Outrage threatens slower Dragon-types such as Naganadel and non-Choice Scarf Haxorus and Pokemon that can't OHKO Dragapult like Volcanion, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona. Dragon Darts allows Dragapult to bypass Haban Berry users such as Garchomp. Fire Blast beats Kartana and non-Custap Berry Ferrothorn, while U-turn beats Zarude. Clear Body gives Dragapult the edge against Intimidate + Bulldoze Arcanine and Bulldoze Entei, while Infiltrator makes Dragapult reliable versus SubSeed users such as Whimsicott and Venusaur.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The given EV spread and an Adamant nature allow Dragapult to outspeed Naganadel and give it the best odds to OHKO Metagross and Landorus-T. 4 Special Defense EVs slightly improve Dragapult's odds to survive an Ice Beam from Modest Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. A Jolly nature is better against other Dragapult and some Zeraora.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against slower Dragon-types, Dragon Darts is usually the superior move because the first hit activates the foe's Haban Berry, allowing the second hit to be full power. Due to the 2 turn nature of Phantom Force, Endure users with priority moves can slowly chip down Dragapult, most notably Endure + Bullet Punch Metagross and Endure + Grassy Glide Rillaboom. Kee Berry + Moonlight Cresselia also wins, since it can out-heal Phantom Force at +1 Defense.</p>"

      "Will-O-Wisp + Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp + Hex Dragapult uses its high Speed and Weakness Policy to beat slower physical attackers. Substitute and Disable allow Dragapult to beat Choice-locked attackers. Additionally, if Dragapult is hit by a super effective move that does not OHKO it, such as Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam, it can fire off a 130-Base Power Hex at +2. The versatility of this set is very appealing: with Will-O-Wisp, Substitute, and Disable, Dragapult can win a lot of unexpected matchups such as against Choice Band Urshifu-S, Avalugg, and non-Lum Berry Landorus-T.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Speed investment allows Dragapult to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt so that it can safely use Substitute against them. The HP and Defense investment give Dragapult the best odds to survive burned Choice Band Avalugg's Icicle Spear.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against most physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Rhyperior, and Aggron, it is safest to use Will-O-Wisp turn 1. This weakens their attacks and allows Dragapult to break Sturdy or play more confidently around a potential Custap Berry on future turns. Using Substitute after Will-O-Wisp racks up burn damage, putting foes into KO range of a boosted Hex. Additionally, when facing the likes of Choice Specs Naganadel, using Substitute + Disable forces the foe to use Struggle. Disable is also helpful if a Pokemon usually only runs one move to hit Dragapult hard, such as Dazzling Gleam Tapu Bulu.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curse Dragapult has a much better matchup versus bulkier Pokemon because Curse does consistent damage over time and Disable denies recovery. Substitute and Phantom Force buy turns for Dragapult to whittle down foes with Curse. Protect also buys extra turns against moves that can bypass Substitute, such as Rhyperior and Crustle's Rock Blast and Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Additionally, having Substitute or Protect + Disable allows Dragapult to retain its matchup versus many Choice item users. Furthermore, many Pokemon may only have one move that can OHKO Dragapult, which can be Disabled to let Curse damage build up. Clear Body is used to help increase Dragapult's reliability against Bulldoze Entei.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Speed investment and a Jolly nature are for outspeeding Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt, while the rest of the EVs are put into Defense for the best chances against the likes of Choice Band Rock Blast Aggron.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 244 HP / 4 Def / 100 SpD / 160 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used as well. The HP EVs make it so that Curse activates Sitrus Berry, so Dragapult can use Substitute five times with Sitrus Berry's recovery. 160 Speed EVs and a boosting nature allow Dragapult to outspeed Spectrier. The Special Defense investment almost always allows Dragapult to survive Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon after Curse and Sitrus Berry. The final 4 EVs are put into Defense to marginally help with Rock Blast from Aggron or Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Curse Dragapult has many unintuitive matchups due in large part to its flexibility and varied lines of play that Substitute, Disable, and Curse afford it.</p> <p>For example, against Magnezone, Dragapult should use Curse turn 1. If Flash Cannon does about 65%, it is Choice Specs Magnezone. Dragapult should then use Disable followed by Phantom Force. Otherwise, Dragapult should use Substitute followed by Phantom Force.</p> <p>Against Entei, it is important to pay attention to its ability. If Entei reveals Pressure, this indicates Pressure stall Entei, which means Dragapult should use Substitute turn 1 followed up by Curse because Pressure stall Entei does not often run moves that can break past its Substitute. However, if no ability is revealed, this indicates Assault Vest Entei, which means that Dragapult should use Curse turn 1 followed by Substitute, Disable, and Phantom Force.</p> <p>Against Aggron, Dragapult should use Substitute turn 1 followed by Disable to force Choice Band Aggron to use Struggle. On turn 3, Dragapult should use Substitute followed by two Phantom Forces, although this makes Aggron not take Struggle recoil during recharge turns.</p> <p>Finally, Curse Dragapult does run into some mind games versus certain Pokemon like Spectrier. Turn 1 is fairly straightforward: Spectrier will reveal Hex or Shadow Ball, and Dragapult should use Substitute. Next, Dragapult can either use Disable to win if the opponent uses Hex again or use Substitute again turn 2 as Spectrier uses Taunt, which will win with Phantom Force. Neither turn 2 play is clearly better.</p>"

Draco Meteor OHKOes non-Choice Scarf Haxorus, Naganadel, non-Assault Vest Urshifu-R and Urshifu-S, Zarude, and Porygon-Z.  Fire Blast or Flamethrower allow Dragapult to have a super effective move against Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Choice Specs Magnezone. Fire Blast's additional Base Power greatly improves the Tapu Bulu matchup, but Flamethrower can be run for better reliability versus Ferrothorn. Finally, Hydro Pump gives Dragapult the ability to beat Pokemon such as Heatran and some Rhyperior. Infiltrator is the preferred ability in order to be reliable versus SubSeed users such as Whimsicott and Venusaur and helps against Substitute + Protect users such as Entei.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>4 Special Defense EVs help with the Choice Specs Magnezone matchup. A Modest nature is generally preferred, as even with Choice Specs and high Base Power moves, Dragapult's only average Special Attack can lead it to come up short against the likes of Tapu Bulu. However, a Timid nature can be ran to outspeed Choice Scarf Dracozolt and Dracovish as well as Speed tie with other Dragapult.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult is fairly straightforward. However, it is important to note that similar to many other Choice item users, Dragapult can be susceptible to Custap Berry users such as Garchomp and Dracovish.

An alternative spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature and the moves Wicked Blow / Close Combat / Sucker Punch / Bulk Up can be used instead for a more reliable matchup against opposing Urshifu, Sawk, and non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wicked Blow is an excellent move to use on Pokemon that can't be hit super effectively otherwise, in addition to dealing heavy damage to Sturdy users like Magnezone, Aggron, and Crustle, matchups where using Close Combat could lose. Close Combat should be used on Pokemon that Urshifu-S OHKOes with it, most notably Tyranitar. Sucker Punch is a good way to secure a win against opposing Custap Berry users and can force foes like non-Choice Specs Volcarona into terrifying coinflip scenarios. Bulk Up is used for general stallbreaking and making matchups easier to approach, in particular beating Pokemon that rely on Counter to win, such as Chansey, Rhyperior, and Swampert. Counter can be used instead to more reliably win matchups against Choice Band Pheromosa, Choice Scarf users like Haxorus, Play Rough Arcanine, Dracovish, and Life Orb Rillaboom. It is is worth noting that certain Dragapult sets may be running Substitute + Disable; thus, it is advisable to use Sucker Punch after using Wicked Blow to avoid Wicked Blow being disabled.</p>"

      "Custap Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Custap Berry Urshifu-S's purpose is, generally speaking, a lure set to catch players off guard. Its main allure is turning many unwinnable matchups into coinflips, such as Choice Band Zeraora with Play Rough, Porygon-Z, and Celesteela. While giving up Sucker Punch can be detrimental, the addition of an extremely strong Reversal benefits Urshifu-S greatly, OHKOing many threats at maximum power like Zeraora, Regidrago, Volcanion, most Celesteela, and Garchomp. Endure is an absolute staple on all Custap Berry sets in 1v1 for its ability to guarantee the Berry's activation.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>The Special Defense EVs in conjunction with 168 HP EVs allow Urshifu-S to survive Air Slash from non-Choice Specs Celesteela while the HP lets it survive Choice Scarf Dracovish's Fishious Rend. The Speed investment has Urshifu-S outpace Adamant base 75 Speed Pokemon such as Dracovish and Dracozolt. All extra EVs go into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, you will want to use Endure on incoming big hits, such as Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Dragapult, Hyper Beam from Porygon-Z, and Superpower or Giga Impact from Galarian Darmanitan. Urshifu-S has a massive advantage in that the only way for foes to prevent the Custap Berry's activation is with priority or their own Endure, since Urshifu-S's ability, Unseen Fist, allows it to bypass all forms of protection. Thus, it breaks through Pokemon such as Life Orb Kartana and Life Orb Dracovish, which carry Protect for other Custap Berry users. Bulk Up secures core matchups such as Assault Vest Swampert, Registeel, Corviknight, Rhyperior, and Steelix, among others. Substitute + Disable Dragapult sets can attempt to neutralize Wicked Blow, which should be countered by using Endure on turn 2.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Urshifu-S hits very hard, being able to defeat many frail Pokemon like Regieleki with a single Sucker Punch. Fling is used in the last moveslot to deal with Disable shenanigans from Dragapult and Spectrier by using Fling + Wicked Blow. Ice Punch can be used to defeat unusually bulky variants of Garchomp.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment is used to outrun base 80 Speed Pokemon at minimum, such as Venusaur and Regidrago. The choice of nature depends on if you need Urshifu-S to either outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, most notably non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, or use the raw power to OHKO threats like Landorus-T with Wicked Blow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use the super effective move, or use Wicked Blow on neutral targets like Landorus-T, Volcanion, and Regidrago. For Regieleki, use Sucker Punch to OHKO most variants. Use Fling if your opponent has a Dragapult and you suspect it is a Substitute + Disable variant; Fling may also be used versus Sturdy Pokemon such as Magnezone, Aggron, and Crustle. Choice Band Urshifu-S is a good choice into teams whose main way of dispatching offensive threats is with a bulky wall, such as Registeel or Chansey.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Urshifu-S outspeeds the entire offensive metagame, excluding opposing Choice Scarf users and Regieleki. This lets it catch certain Pokemon, such as Dragapult, by surprise, smashing it with a very swift Wicked Blow, while Close Combat OHKOes Galarian Darmanitan cleanly. Choice Scarf Urshifu-S has a nice amount of variety in its final two moveslots; as a third move, Fire Punch melts Ferrothorn and Pheromosa, but Fling can be used instead in matchups where not being Choice-locked would be very helpful, such as against Corviknight and Registeel. Fling is best used with Bulk Up in the last moveslot since it retains Urshifu-S's immensely useful ability to break stall Pokemon. In the final moveslot, Ice Punch easily shatters Landorus-T and Garchomp, Stone Edge clobbers Volcarona, and Poison Jab deals with non-Kebia Berry variants of Whimsicott carrying Moonblast.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>EVs are completely maxed out in Attack and Speed in order to hit as hard and fast as possible, with a Jolly nature making matchups such as Pheromosa and Volcarona very favorable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Urshifu does well into teams where the opponent's counter to offensive Pokemon is another offensive Pokemon, most notably taking advantage of people who tend to run Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan or Dragapult to fulfill this role. Occasionally, you may need to use Fling versus stall Pokemon like Galarian Corsola, Chansey, Corviknight, and Registeel and use Bulk Up afterward if it's on the set.</p>"

This allows it to lure some would-be counters like Sylveon, Nihilego, Goodra, and Mirror Coat Avalugg while retaining solid matchups against most other special attackers.

Hyper Beam deals with some frail Pokemon that resist Electric, like Naganadel, Haxorus, and opposing Regieleki.

Against potential Endure users like Primarina and Galarian Moltres, Regieleki should use Thunder Cage to KO them with trapping damage if they use Endure. In situations where Thunder Cage deals sufficient damage to KO, it should be used over Thunder, as it has a smaller risk to miss.</p>"

This set runs an EV spread of 12 HP / 132 Atk / 204 Def / 48 SpD / 112 Spe with the Impish nature and the moves Breaking Swipe, Outrage, Draco Meteor, and Dragon Dance or Scale Shot. The physical bulk allows Regidrago to survive a Choice Band Avalugg's Avalanche and KO it back with Draco Meteor. This set also beats non-Choice Band Glastrier by using Breaking Swipe, surviving any follow-up attack, then finishing it off with a +2 Outrage. The Special Defense and Speed EVs allow Regidrago to survive Nihilego's Meteor Beam and outspeed it at +1. With these EVs, Regidrago also outspeeds other Pokemon like Entei and Zapdos after Scale Shot. Running Dragon Dance on this set helps with the Chansey matchup, but Scale Shot helps more versus a greater variety of Pokemon.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Scale Shot is used to outspeed foes and then deal immense damage to them the following turn with Outrage or Drago Meteor. It also breaks potential Substitutes and gives a +1 Speed boost, letting Regidrago outspeed Pokemon like Entei, Zapdos, and Volcarona. Outrage OHKOes many Dragon-types such as Naganadel and Dragapult after surviving their attacks with Haban Berry. Breaking Swipe + Draco Meteor improves the Avalugg matchup, as at -1 Attack, Regidrago survives an Icicle Spear and has favorable odds to tank an Avalanche. Then, Regidrago KOes back with Draco Meteor due to Avalugg's bad Special Defense.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>With 96 Speed EVs and a Speed boost from Scale Shot, Regidrago outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokemon like Entei and the Zapdos formes. The Defense investment alongside Haban Berry allows Regidrago to tank a Dragon Darts from Choice Band Dragapult, and the Special Defense investment allows Regidrago to survive Draco Meteor from Modest Choice Specs Naganadel.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Def / 24 SpA / 144 SpD with a Bold nature can be run to beat Choice Band Zeraora. It does not have the Speed investment that the main spread has, though, so it won't outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon after Scale Shot. This set should run Dragon Energy over Draco Meteor to deal more consistent damage to Rhyperior, Volcanion, and Swampert while also retaining some stallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scale Shot should be used turn 1 versus faster stall Pokemon, especially Entei and Zapdos, since +1 Regidrago outspeeds and 2HKOes them with Outrage.</p> <p>Breaking Swipe should be used to reduce Avalugg's or Crustle's Attack and break their Sturdy ability; Regidrago survives their attacks at -1 and KOes either with Draco Meteor afterwards.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is usually used on turn 1, followed by Outrage on turn 2, since it does more damage than a -2 Draco Meteor. Dragon Energy deals more damage to targets like Volcanion and Rhyperior. Scale Shot helps Regidrago outspeed foes like SubSeed Rillaboom, breaking potential Substitutes as well. Assault Vest helps Regidrago secure matchups that it would lose otherwise, including Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Choice Specs Kyurem.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>8 Speed EVs allow Regidrago to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Cresselia and Rillaboom after a Scale Shot.

With Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp, Spectrier can easily deal with Pokemon that rely on one type of attack, burning physical attackers like Galarian Darmanitan, Haxorus, and Aggron while boosting its Special Defense in front of special attackers like Landorus. Taunt is used to shut down stall Pokemon such as Registeel, Chansey, and Cresselia. Hex pairs very well with Will-O-Wisp thanks to burn doubling Hex's Base Power, but Shadow Ball provides consistent damage versus Pokemon immune to burn, like Heatran, Volcanion, and Misty Surge Tapu Fini. Shadow Ball is also more consistent because it does not rely on Will-O-Wisp, since it is inaccurate and is shut down by Trick users like Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Togekiss.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>184 HP EVs combines with 24 Special Defense EVs for Spectrier to survive two Earth Powers from Timid Choice Specs Landorus after a Calm Mind boost, and 52 Defense EVs allow it to survive two Outrage from Jolly Choice Band Garchomp. 184 Speed EVs allow Spectrier to outrun Timid Naganadel.

Thanks to its excellent natural special bulk, it often doesn't need to use Calm Mind in front of other special attackers. Exceptions include using Calm Mind when facing opposing setup, such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and using Calm Mind to make matchups against Magnezone and Naganadel more reliable. Taunt defeats stall Cresselia by denying its Moonlight recovery and Calm Mind boosts while shutting down Chansey and Registeel hard, since they can't hit Spectrier with their attacks.

Defeating Zeraora is as simple as using Mud Shot twice. Outside of this, however, the main gameplan is to use Will-O-Wisp turn 1 so that Hex turn 2 deals double damage, which reliably defeats numerous physical attackers, such as Metagross, Kartana, Urshifu-R, and Rhyperior. If running Calm Mind, it should be used against threats such as Kyurem and Volcanion, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB attacks; otherwise, if using Disable, utilize it to shut down opposing Choice-locked foes.</p>"
