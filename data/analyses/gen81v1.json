        "description": "<p>Chansey is one of the bulkier walls by virtue of high HP and Eviolite, walling many prominent special attackers such as Primarina, Magnezone, and Volcanion. Toxic helps dispatch threats that can heal up on Chansey such as defensive Arcanine, Roost Kyurem, and non-Rest Togekiss. Soft-Boiled helps to keep Chansey at high HP while slowly whittling down the foe with the combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic. While Chansey's physical bulk is not nearly as good as its special bulk, the given EV investment allows for its to be as physically bulky as possible, giving it the best chance to survive a hit from Choice item Haxorus, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and non-Swords Dance Landorus-Therian, to OHKO them with Counter. Charm is an option over Counter to handle physical attackers that would like to set up on Chansey such as Shell Smash Crustle, Swords Dance Landorus-Therian, and non-Taunt Bulk Up Zeraora. Charm should be used to PP stall and negate boosts from the foe's setup moves to a point where any combination of Chansey's moves will win. Do note that replacing Counter with Charm usually results in losing matchups against Choice Band users such as Landorus-Therian and Choice Band Zeraora, which can 2HKO Chansey through Charm.</p> <p>Chansey is taken advantage of by Choice item attackers with Trick such as Cresselia, Porygon-Z, and Tapu Fini. Toxic can assist in dealing certain anti-stall measures such as Encore and Trick Togekiss and some Fake Tears Sylveon. Versus Sylveon it is optimal to use Toxic on the first turn, then Seismic Toss, then Soft-Boiled, and finally Seismic Toss to avoid being KOed by Hyper Beam at -6. Good teammates for Chansey are attackers that don't care about Trick and are able to retaliate, such as Assault Vest or Choice item Metagross and Aromatisse. Chansey also doesn't appreciate faster Taunt users such as Spectrier and Corviknight, as they PP stall Chansey and slowly chip it down. Good partners that alleviate this weakness include Choice Scarf Galarian Darminatan and Zeraora.</p> "

Bullet Punch finishes off weakened foes and is extremely useful for KOing Sturdy or Custap Berry users like Sawk, Magnezone, and Primarina. Earthquake hits Steel- and Electric-types like Tapu Koko, most Zeraora, and Magnezone. Ice Punch hits non-Choice Band Landorus-T and Landorus, Zapdos, Dragapult, and some Garchomp. Power-Up Punch is a useful alternative for better matchups against Iron Defense Tapu Koko and Iron Defense Tapu Fini.

The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack for better KO odds versus Dragapult.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>There are some matchups that are a bit different than using the highest damaging move. For example, against Crustle you use Bullet Punch turn 1 because it can use Counter, and then KO it with Meteor Mash the next turn. Versus Tapu Fini, use Meteor Mash instead of Power-Up Punch turn 1 to avoid getting locked into Power-Up Punch by Trick. Against Tapu Koko, use Earthquake turn 1, and if it uses Iron Defense, start using Power-Up Punch until Earthquake can 2HKO it. Against Encore + Disable users like Gardevoir, Alolan Ninetales, and Aromatisse, always use Meteor Mash turn 1, and use Bullet Punch turn 2 to avoid being forced to use Struggle. Against Togekiss, you should use Bullet Punch turn 1 to scout its set. If it's Kee Berry or Babiri Berry, you should use Power-Up Punch turn 2 and then use Meteor Mash turn 3. Even if it uses Encore turn 2, you can still finish it off by using Bullet Punch when Metagross's Encore ends. If it's another Togekiss set, you can use Meteor Mash turn 2 to finish it off.</p> "

However, against certain Trick users such as Cresselia and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, it is safest to use Encore Turn 1. This locks you into Encore again but nets you a free move Turn 3 to use Air Slash, which locks you into Air Slash for the final turn of Encore on Turn 4, resetting the cycle. If the foe uses an attacking move Turn 1 and deals less than half of Togekiss's health, it is generally safe to spam Roost and fish for paralysis turns before going for flinches with Air Slash. This keeps Togekiss from dropping to a stray critical hit as well as not risking being caught by priority or some other gimmick such as a surprise Custap Berry user. If the foe uses a setup or status move such as Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Substitute, Togekiss should usually use Encore to lock them into their move so they can safely break them down without needing to deal with flinch and paralysis chances as long as Togekiss outspeeds. Where Togekiss shouldn't use Encore is against Pokemon like Aromatisse.

Then, while in Custap Berry range, it can OHKO back with Hyper Beam or Ice Beam.

Icicle Crash also has a 30% flinch chance, allowing Galarian Darmanitan to potentially beat Sturdy users and bulkier threats like Crustle and Aromatisse. Giga Impact OHKOes many bulkier Pokemon such as Sylveon and Primarina and even has a chance to OHKO physically defensive Tapu Fini. Flare Blitz does massive damage to Steel-types, notably OHKOing Registeel and non-Occa Berry Celesteela, and also helps Galarian Darmanitan defeat slower Volcarona sets.

Mental Herb allows Crustle to safely Shell Smash against Encore Aromatisse and Taunt users such as Whimsicott. Rock Blast is used to break past Substitute users such as Entei, Zapdos, or Whimsicott to avoid Rock Wrecker's recharge turn.

Thanks to its high Attack stat and strong moves, it breaks past Pokemon like Volcanion, Tapu Bulu, and Volcarona. Mold Breaker can be used instead of Unnerve to beat Pokemon such as Magnezone, Sawk, Aggron, and, if Haxorus has Aqua Tail, Rhyperior.</p> <p>Outrage is a strong STAB attack that can be used against other Dragon-types, like Regidrago, Goodra, and Kommo-o, or other Pokemon that take neutral damage such as Volcanion, Volcarona, and Rillaboom. Low Kick and Superpower are used to avoid the Special Defense stat drops from Close Combat: Low Kick and Superpower are used to beat Heatran and Magnezone, while Superpower is used with an Adamant nature to have a better matchup against Urshifu-S and Chansey but with a worse matchup against Ferrothorn. Iron Tail OHKOes Sylveon and threatens Fairy-types like non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and some Togekiss. Earthquake beats a few Metagross and Tapu Koko sets. Poison Jab beats Tapu Bulu, threatens a few Tapu Koko sets, and is more reliable versus Whimsicott. First Impression can be used for Regieleki, Hydreigon, and Zarude, while Aqua Tail is used with Mold Breaker to beat Rhyperior.

Outrage threatens slower Dragon-types such as Naganadel and non-Choice Scarf Haxorus and Pokemon that can't OHKO Dragapult like Volcanion, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona. Dragon Darts allows Dragapult to bypass Haban Berry users such as Garchomp. Fire Blast beats Kartana and non-Custap Berry Ferrothorn, while U-turn beats Zarude.

A Jolly nature is better against other Dragapult and some Zeraora.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against slower Dragon-types, Dragon Darts is usually the superior move because the first hit activates the foe's Haban Berry, allowing the second hit to be full power. Due to the 2 turn nature of Phantom Force, Endure users with priority moves can slowly chip down Dragapult, most notably Endure + Bullet Punch Metagross and Endure + Grassy Glide Rillaboom.

Substitute and Disable allow Dragapult to beat Choice-locked attackers. Additionally, if Dragapult is hit by a super effective move that does not OHKO it, such as Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam, it can fire off a 130-Base Power Hex at +2. The versatility of this set is very appealing: with Will-O-Wisp, Substitute, and Disable, Dragapult can win a lot of unexpected matchups such as against Choice Band Urshifu-S, Avalugg, and non-Lum Berry Landorus-T.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Speed investment allows Dragapult to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt so that it can safely use Substitute against them. The HP and Defense investment give Dragapult the best odds to survive burned Choice Band Avalugg's Icicle Spear.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against most physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Rhyperior, and Aggron, it is safest to use Will-O-Wisp turn 1. This weakens their attacks and allows Dragapult to break Sturdy or play more confidently around a potential Custap Berry on future turns. Using Substitute after Will-O-Wisp racks up burn damage, putting foes into KO range of a boosted Hex. Additionally, when facing the likes of Choice Specs Naganadel, using Substitute + Disable forces the foe to use Struggle.

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Curse Dragapult has a much better matchup versus bulkier Pokemon because Curse does consistent damage over time and Disable denies recovery. Substitute and Phantom Force buy turns for Dragapult to whittle down foes with Curse. Protect also buys extra turns against moves that can bypass Substitute, such as Rhyperior and Crustle's Rock Blast and Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Additionally, having Substitute or Protect + Disable allows Dragapult to retain its matchup versus many Choice item users. Furthermore, many Pokemon may only have one move that can OHKO Dragapult, which can be Disabled to let Curse damage build up. Clear Body is used to help increase Dragapult's reliability against Bulldoze Entei.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Speed investment and a Jolly nature are for outspeeding Choice Scarf Dracovish and Dracozolt, while the rest of the EVs are put into Defense for the best chances against the likes of Choice Band Rock Blast Aggron.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 244 HP / 4 Def / 100 SpD / 160 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used as well. The HP EVs make it so that Curse activates Sitrus Berry, so Dragapult can use Substitute five times with Sitrus Berry's recovery. 160 Speed EVs and a boosting nature allow Dragapult to outspeed Spectrier. The Special Defense investment almost always allows Dragapult to survive Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon after Curse and Sitrus Berry. The final 4 EVs are put into Defense to marginally help with Rock Blast from Aggron or Crustle.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Curse Dragapult has many unintuitive matchups due in large part to its flexibility and varied lines of play that Substitute, Disable, and Curse afford it.</p> <p>For example, against Magnezone, Dragapult should use Curse turn 1. If Flash Cannon does about 65%, it is Choice Specs Magnezone. Dragapult should then use Disable followed by Phantom Force. Otherwise, Dragapult should use Substitute followed by Phantom Force.</p> <p>Against Entei, it is important to pay attention to its ability. If Entei reveals Pressure, this indicates Pressure stall Entei, which means Dragapult should use Substitute turn 1 followed up by Curse because Pressure stall Entei does not often run moves that can break past its Substitute. However, if no ability is revealed, this indicates Assault Vest Entei, which means that Dragapult should use Curse turn 1 followed by Substitute, Disable, and Phantom Force.</p> <p>Against Aggron, Dragapult should use Substitute turn 1 followed by Disable to force Choice Band Aggron to use Struggle. On turn 3, Dragapult should use Substitute followed by two Phantom Forces, although this makes Aggron not take Struggle recoil during recharge turns.</p> <p>Finally, Curse Dragapult does run into some mind games versus certain Pokemon like Spectrier. Turn 1 is fairly straightforward: Spectrier will reveal Hex or Shadow Ball, and Dragapult should use Substitute. Next, Dragapult can either use Disable to win if the opponent uses Hex again or use Substitute again turn 2 as Spectrier uses Taunt, which will win with Phantom Force. Neither turn 2 play is clearly better.</p> "

This set should run Dragon Energy over Draco Meteor to deal more consistent damage to Rhyperior, Volcanion, and Swampert while also retaining some stallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scale Shot should be used turn 1 versus faster stall Pokemon, especially Entei and Zapdos, since +1 Regidrago outspeeds and 2HKOes them with Outrage.</p> <p>Breaking Swipe should be used to reduce Avalugg's or Crustle's Attack and break their Sturdy ability; Regidrago survives their attacks at -1 and KOes either with Draco Meteor afterwards.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is usually used on turn 1, followed by Outrage on turn 2, since it does more damage than a -2 Draco Meteor. Dragon Energy deals more damage to targets like Volcanion and Rhyperior. Scale Shot helps Regidrago outspeed foes like SubSeed Rillaboom, breaking potential Substitutes as well. Assault Vest helps Regidrago secure matchups that it would lose otherwise, including Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Choice Specs Kyurem.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>8 Speed EVs allow Regidrago to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Cresselia and Rillaboom after a Scale Shot. With the bulk investment, Regidrago survives two Wicked Blows from maximum Attack Urshifu-S without an Attack-boosting nature and a Hyper Beam from Choice Specs Porygon-Z.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread of 12 HP / 204 Def / 8 SpA / 248 SpD / 36 Spe with a Bold nature and Breaking Swipe over Outrage secures the Choice Band Avalugg matchup. The Speed is for outspeeding Porygon-Z after a Scale Shot, and the Special Defense allows Regidrago to survive Nihilego's Acid Spray into Meteor Beam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Substitute users and base 85 Speed Pokemon, use Scale Shot first and follow up with one of your stronger STAB attacks.</p> <p>When versus Porygon-Z, use Draco Meteor on turn 1 because it almost always KOes. If Porygon-Z survives, then Outrage can be used on turn 2 while Porygon-Z recharges after Hyper Beam. If using the alternate spread, Scale Shot should be used turn 1 versus Porygon-Z because it has less Special Attack investment, though this is a losing sequence if Porygon-Z uses Trick because Scale Shot does not reliably 2HKO.</p> <p>Another matchup where Regidrago should use Draco Meteor on turn 1 is Urshifu-S; it should OHKO all variants except for Assault Vest, which can be dealt with by using Outrage on turn 2.</p> "

Draco Meteor deals consistent damage to most targets like Zeraora, Galarian Darmanitan, and Dragapult after Regidrago is in Custap Berry range. Scale Shot is used to shut down some stall Pokemon like SubSeed Rillaboom, Breaking Swipe helps in the Zeraora matchup, and Outrage helps versus most Tyranitar and non-Kee Berry Volcarona. Dragon Energy hits slower foes like Volcanion and Rhyperior for heavy damage.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Defense investment lets Regidrago survive an Avalanche from Choice Band Aggron and gives it good chances to avoid the 2HKO from Urshifu-S's unboosted Wicked Blow, while the Special Attack investment alongside a Modest nature allows Regidrago to always 2HKO most Assault Vest Urshifu sets with Draco Meteor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Endure versus Pokemon that threaten to OHKO Regidrago, such as Galarian Darmanitan, Naganadel, Dragapult, and Haxorus. Some of these threats have some counterplay; Dragapult can run Substitute, Life Orb Naganadel can run Protect, and Haxorus can nullify Regidrago's Custap Berry with Unnerve.</p> <p>If running Breaking Swipe, it should be used against Zeraora turn 1 to reduce its Attack. Use Outrage against Tyranitar because it does more damage than Regidrago's other moves. When low on HP, Draco Meteor or Outrage should always be used over Dragon Energy.</p> "

Regidrago uses Fire Fang to OHKO Kartana and 2HKO Ferrothorn and Magnezone and Crunch to 2HKO Metagross.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The Defense and HP investment allows Regidrago to survive two unboosted Meteor Mashes from Metagross so it can use Crunch to 2HKO. 96 Speed EVs allow Regidrago to outspeed neutral-natured Magnezone and 2HKO with Fire Fang, while the Special Defense investment allows Regidrago to survive two Flash Cannons from it.

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Spectrier has an excellent niche in 1v1 as a setup Pokemon that can easily beat other setup Pokemon using Will-O-Wisp, Calm Mind, and Taunt. Spectrier's usage as a very potent two-turn nuke is applicable, being able to deal with Pokemon such as Aggron, Magnezone, and Naganadel. With Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp, Spectrier can easily deal with Pokemon that rely on one type of attack, burning physical attackers like Galarian Darmanitan, Haxorus, and Aggron while boosting its Special Defense in front of special attackers like Landorus. Taunt is used to shut down stall Pokemon such as Registeel, Chansey, and Cresselia. Hex pairs very well with Will-O-Wisp thanks to burn doubling Hex's Base Power, but Shadow Ball provides consistent damage versus Pokemon immune to burn, like Heatran, Volcanion, and Misty Surge Tapu Fini. Shadow Ball is also more consistent because it does not rely on Will-O-Wisp, since it is inaccurate and is shut down by Trick users like Choice Scarf Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Togekiss.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>184 HP EVs combines with 24 Special Defense EVs for Spectrier to survive two Earth Powers from Timid Choice Specs Landorus after a Calm Mind boost, and 52 Defense EVs allow it to survive two Outrage from Jolly Choice Band Garchomp. 184 Speed EVs allow Spectrier to outrun Timid Naganadel. All remaining EVs go into Special Attack for better damage rolls against Galarian Darmanitan and Haxorus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Spectrier's most basic sequence is Will-O-Wisp turn 1 into Hex turn 2. However, sometimes Will-O-Wisp is just too risky, such as when facing Nasty Plot Life Orb Naganadel. Aside from move choice, Spectrier is very straightforward to use. Thanks to its excellent natural special bulk, it often doesn't need to use Calm Mind in front of other special attackers. Exceptions include using Calm Mind when facing opposing setup, such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and using Calm Mind to make matchups against Magnezone and Naganadel more reliable. Taunt defeats stall Cresselia by denying its Moonlight recovery and Calm Mind boosts while shutting down Chansey and Registeel hard, since they can't hit Spectrier with their attacks. Versus Chansey, use Taunt and then Will-O-Wisp so that burn damage will eventually KO it.</p> "

Disable is incredible in its ability to instantaneously win games if it faces a Choice-locked Pokemon, like Choice Band Landorus-T or Choice Specs Sylveon. The choice between Will-O-Wisp and Substitute depends on how much reliability is needed beating physical attackers with multi-hit moves such as Rhyperior and Crustle, as well as opposing Choice Scarf users like Haxorus, versus how much reliability is needed against  Choice-locked Pokemon that don't run multi-hit moves such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Pokemon that rely on stat debuffs from Acid Spray to win like Goodra and Nihilego.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>240 HP EVs with 16 Special Defense EVs allow Spectrier to survive a Hyper Beam from Choice Specs Sylveon, in addition to giving as much physical bulk as possible for opposing Struggle.

Mud Shot deals solid damage after a +2 boost, 2HKOing even Assault Vest Zeraora while also dealing with all Heatran sets except Air Balloon, which loses to Hex into Mud Shot instead. Weakness Policy is also handy versus common Knock Off users, like Assault Vest Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Sawk.</p> <h1>EVs</h1> <p>The HP and Defense EVs let Spectrier survive a Knock Off from Choice Band Zeraora, while the Speed EVs let it outpace Jolly Kartana.

Defeating Zeraora is as simple as using Mud Shot twice. Outside of this, however, the main gameplan is to use Will-O-Wisp turn 1 so that Hex turn 2 deals double damage, which reliably defeats numerous physical attackers, such as Metagross, Kartana, Urshifu-R, and Rhyperior. If running Calm Mind, it should be used against threats such as Kyurem and Volcanion, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB attacks; otherwise, if using Disable, utilize it to shut down opposing Choice-locked foes.</p> "
