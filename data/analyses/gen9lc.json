        "description": "<p>Alolan Sandshrew carves out a neat role in LC as both a sweeper and utility Pokemon. Its Ice / Steel typing makes it one of the few reliable Flying-resistant Pokemon in the tier. Triple Axel gives Alolan Sandshrew strong STAB coverage, and Earthquake hits the Fire- and Steel-types that Triple Axel cannot. Building off of this, Alolan Sandshrew has a few useful options depending on team needs: Rapid Spin provides entry hazard control while making it faster than the entire unboosted metagame, Swords Dance allows it to sweep late-game, and Ice Shard picks off weakened threats like Vullaby. Tera Fairy is preferred because it flips the script on Fighting- and Dark-types like Mienfoo and Vullaby, letting Alolan Sandshrew stay in where it normally couldn’t. Alolan Sandshrew also has the option to run Safety Goggles to shut down Spore from opposing Foongus and set up on it.</p> <p>Alolan Sandshrew shines against Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-types, often forcing awkward Terastallizations like Water and Steel from staples like Foongus, Mudbray, and Mienfoo. This opens the door for teammates such as Elekid and Alolan Diglett to make progress. Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support, such as Wingull and Vullaby, also pair very well with Alolan Sandshrew. On the flip side, Alolan Sandshrew really struggles with Mienfoo, Ground-types like Alolan Diglett and Mudbray, and uncommon coverage like Heat Wave from Vullaby. Pairing it with reliable checks to these threats such as Foongus, Grookey, and Chinchou helps cover those weaknesses and gives it the breathing room it needs to do its job.</p>"

Iron Head acts as a secondary STAB option that hits Pokemon that resist Earthquake like Grookey and Toedscool, whereas Sucker Punch gives Alolan Diglett priority, which is helpful to deal with faster setup sweepers like Shellder and Torchic as well as Choice Scarf Gothita and Hisuian Growlithe. Rock Blast is valuable coverage to hit Flying-types like Vullaby and Wattrel for super effective damage. Substitute is useful to allow Alolan Diglett to capitalize on the switches it forces on Pokemon like Mareanie, Glimmet, and Tinkatink while also allowing it to outplay Sucker Punches from Pawniard and Stunky. Life Orb gives a useful power boost, allowing Alolan Diglett to 2HKO Hisuian Voltorb and Mienfoo with Earthquake and 2HKO Toedscool with Iron Head. While a Jolly nature guarantees outspeeding Skunky and tying other Alolan Diglett, an Adamant nature greatly increases Alolan Diglett's power, allowing it to 2HKO Foongus with Earthquake. Tera Ground boosts Alolan Diglett's Earthquake to become even more spammable while also achieving damage thresholds like OHKOing itemless Mienfoo and 2HKOing Foongus, but Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch while also giving a valuable resistance to opposing Sucker Punches.</p> <p>Alolan Diglett fits on teams looking for a strong and reliable revenge killer and physical attacker. Alolan Diglett's relative fraility means it is easily OHKOed if it can't KO its target, so Knock Off support from Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Stunky can help chip down the opposing team for Alolan Diglett. U-turn from Mienfoo, Grookey, and Vullaby can help Alolan Diglett come onto the battlefield to start attacking. Alolan Diglett struggles with bulky physical walls like Mudbray and Grass-types like Grookey and Toedscool, so Pokemon that can deal with these threats like Hisuian Voltorb and Hisuian Growlithe make great partners.</p>"

Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble.

Its ability to spam high-Base Power moves makes it a difficult Pokemon to switch into, often forcing guessing games between Flare Blitz and Head Smash. Psychic Fangs deters more reliable switch-ins to Hisuian Growlithe's STAB moves, hitting Mienfoo and Mareanie. Psychic Fangs also has the additional benefit of breaking screens, something that may hinder Hisuian Growlithe's wallbreaking. The final slot is flexible, with Rock Blast offering a lower-power alternative to Head Smash, with better accuracy and more PP that also beats Terastalized Weak Armor Vullaby. Stealth Rock allows Growlithe to provide role compression to offensive teams through offering entry hazard support, while Sleep Talk lets it sponge Spore from Foongus and still pose a threat. Tera Fire provides a stronger Flare Blitz to power through other bulky checks like Mudbray and the aforementioned Mienfoo.</p> <p>Much like many other wallbreakers in the tier, Hisuian Growlithe prefers having hazards off the field as much as possible. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Vullaby and Toedscool enable it to get in frequently, with the former also able to provide pivoting support and the latter providing Spore support. Mienfoo is another good teammate, as it can tank opposing Hisuian Growlithe's attacks and pivot your own in.

Stealth Rock helps rack up passive damage on opposing Pokemon, while Flame Charge is sometimes chosen for a more offensive approach to make up for Hisuian Growlithe's middling Speed. Will-O-Wisp helps punish common switch-ins like Mienfoo and Mudbray, while Substitute is a safe way to scout for switches and catch Sucker Punch from opposing Pawniard and Stunky. Tera Fire boosts Flare Blitz's damage, allowing it to 2HKO offensive Mudbray, and removes Hisuian Growlithe's weakness to Fighting, while Tera Flying turns Hisuian Growlithe's weaknesses to Ground and Fighting into resistances.</p> <p>Hisuian Growlithe enjoys VoltTurn support from teammates such as Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb, which in turn enjoy Hisuian Growlithe's ability to nuke Pokemon like Foongus and Pawniard. Landing a Will-O-Wisp on prominent physical attackers like Mienfoo and Mudbray is greatly appreciated by setup sweepers such as Shellder, which appreciate not taking as much damage on setup turns. Hisuian Growlithe struggles with Pokemon that can resist its STAB moves and KO it back such as Mienfoo and Glimmet, so it pairs well with trappers like Gothita and Trapinch that can remove them.</p>"

Drain Punch also allows it to damage other Alolan  Grimer neutrally, making it valuable in matchups against opposing Alolan Grimer. Sleep Talk can be used to make Alolan Grimer a great Foongus check and sleep absorber for the team, while Memento gives sweeper teammates a chance to set up.

With Skill Link, its coverage options Icicle Spear and Rock Blast can do even more damage than Liquidation to most neutral targets. Icicle Spear allows it to hit Grass-types super effectively, Rock Blast deals neutral damage to Water-types, and both allow it to OHKO Vullaby. If Shellder uses Tera Water, Liquidation can OHKO Pawniard after Stealth Rock and a boost and become Shellder's most powerful attack. If Shellder instead uses Tera Ghost, it will be immune or resistant to many forms of priority, including Mienfoo’s Fake Out, Timburr's Mach Punch, and Trapinch's First Impression.</p> <p>Shellder can fit on either hyper offense or bulky offense teams. Damage mitigation provided by dual screens from Impidimp, Will-O-Wisp from Gastly, and Memento users such as Stunky can ensure safer setup and, in Reflect's case, weaken priority moves. On hyper offense teams with dual screens or multiple Memento users, sweepers such as Magby and Nasty Plot Vullaby can break alongside Shellder, trying to either break common counters like Pawniard, force out opponents Terastallization, or set up on each other's counters such as Mienfoo. A team that can make significant progress for Shellder early- and mid-game is necessary when Shellder is used on a bulky offense team, since it is usually the main late-game wincon on these teams. Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Vullaby are very effective at damaging the enemy team as well as switching into other Pokemon, while Memento Stunky has defensive utility, can break, and can provide safe setup for Shellder. After setup, Shellder is weak to priority moves like Pawniard's Sucker Punch, defensive Terastallization, and the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier that it can't hit for super effective damage, including Mareanie, Snubbull, and more.</p>"

Hisuian Zorua is often competing with Drifloon for the team's Ghost-type, so it appreciates teammates like Wattrel and Toedscool that can cover for its lack of Ground-type immunity. Crabrawler and Mudbray check opposing Pawniard for Hisuian Zorua when Tera Fight is not an option, and Alolan Grimer, Mudbray, and Croagunk switch into opposing Alolan Grimer.</p>"

Trick is very important on Gothita because without it, Gothita cannot reliably threaten a healthy Foongus due to the threat of Spore, and Trick is effective at crippling bulky foes. Thunderbolt provides coverage against Vullaby, while Energy Ball deals extra damage to Ground-types such as Mudbray. Tera Psychic is the most common Tera type to enable Gothita to secure earlier KOes such as OHKOing a healthy Mienfoo.</p> <p>Gothita fits best on bulky offense or balance teams with other pivots, most notably Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb, which typically struggle against bulky Regenerator Pokemon like Foongus and Mareanie. Choice Scarf Hisuian Growlithe also has significant synergy with Gothita, as bulky Fire resistant Pokemon such as Mareanie and Glimmet are vulnerable to being trapped. Gothita's biggest weaknesses are that it gives free entry to offensive Dark- and Steel-types after it secures a KO and that it lacks power by itself. Therefore, Gothita needs both a defensive backbone with teammates such as Mienfoo, Mudbray, and Glimmet to switch into Dark-types, as well as offensive threats and sweepers like Shellder and the aforementioned Hisuian Voltorb to break through defensive cores.</p>"

With the longevity provided by Regenerator and Synthesis, Foongus is able to reliably check many threats over the course of the game, including Chinchou, Grookey, and Mienfoo. Spore is threatening due to the fast-paced nature of Little Cup and luck-based nature of sleep. However, due to Foongus being relatively passive, it can be taken advantage of offensively once Spore has been exhausted.</p>",

However, due to the reduced bulk, Foongus will take significantly more damage from Chinchou's Ice Beam, Elekid's Psychic, and Glimmet's Power Gem. Tera Ghost can be used for Foongus to escape Gothita's Shadow Tag, but it leaves Foongus weak to Knock Off from multiple Pokemon including Mienfoo, Vullaby, Stunky, and Grookey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Spore-Immune Pokemon</strong>: Some Pokemon are able to use items or moves to block Spore from Foongus while not being threatened by its STAB moves. Alolan Sandshrew can use Safety Goggles to safely switch in on Foongus and threaten it with Triple Axel, while Stunky can use Substitute, which Foongus cannot break in one hit.</p> <p><strong>Gothita</strong>: Gothita is able to easily trap and remove Foongus with Psychic, which can be made easier with help provided by Chinchou or Elekid's Volt Switch or Mienfoo's U-turn. Additionally, Gothita can opt for a Tera Steel SubCM set that completely shuts down and turns Fooongus into a setup opportunity for it to sweep.</p>",

Sludge Bomb's chance for poison can ruin potential switch-ins such as Mienfoo or Toedscool. Synthesis provides extra longevity so Foongus doesn't solely rely on Regenerator, as Giga Drain doesn't provide consistent healing. The given EV spread maximizes Foongus's bulk, allowing it to soft check a variety of Pokemon. Tera Water is a generally good Tera type and makes Foongus resistant to Shellder's Icicle Spear but leaves Foongus vulnerable to Electric- and Grass-types such as Elekid and Grookey in return. Tera Steel allows Foongus to resist Vullaby's Brave Bird and is more effective at checking Shellder with the added resistance to Rock Blast; however, Foongus becomes weak to Ground- and Fighting-types such as Mudbray and Mienfoo. It should be noted that once Terastallized, Foongus is no longer able to absorb Spore from opposing Foongus.</p> <p>Foongus is a staple on many teams and defensively supports its team with its longevity and Spore. Wingull and Vullaby appreciate Foongus switching in on Electric-type moves from Chinchou and Elekid. Foongus has issues with Flying-types such as Wingull and Vullaby, making Chinchou a good partner. Teammates that can remove entry hazards like Defog Vullaby and Rapid Spin Alolan Sandshrew enable Foongus to switch around more comfortably. As Foongus often acts as a check to itself, Pokemon that can help it succeed in the mirror match such as Alolan Sandshrew and Stunky make good teammates.

Tera Water gives Mienfoo a host of invaluable resistances, most notably Torchic's Fire Blast and Shellder's Liquidation, while Tera Fairy is a more niche pick that counters opposing Mienfoo.
