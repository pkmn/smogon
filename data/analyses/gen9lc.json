Iron Head acts as a secondary STAB option that hits Pokemon that resist Earthquake like Grookey and Toedscool, whereas Sucker Punch gives Alolan Diglett priority, which is helpful to deal with faster setup sweepers like Shellder and Torchic as well as Choice Scarf Gothita and Hisuian Growlithe. Rock Blast is valuable coverage to hit Flying-types like Vullaby and Wattrel for super effective damage. Substitute is useful to allow Alolan Diglett to capitalize on the switches it forces on Pokemon like Mareanie, Glimmet, and Tinkatink while also allowing it to outplay Sucker Punches from Pawniard and Stunky. Life Orb gives a useful power boost, allowing Alolan Diglett to 2HKO Hisuian Voltorb and Mienfoo with Earthquake and 2HKO Toedscool with Iron Head. While a Jolly nature guarantees outspeeding Skunky and tying other Alolan Diglett, an Adamant nature greatly increases Alolan Diglett's power, allowing it to 2HKO Foongus with Earthquake. Tera Ground boosts Alolan Diglett's Earthquake to become even more spammable while also achieving damage thresholds like OHKOing itemless Mienfoo and 2HKOing Foongus, but Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch while also giving a valuable resistance to opposing Sucker Punches.</p> <p>Alolan Diglett fits on teams looking for a strong and reliable revenge killer and physical attacker. Alolan Diglett's relative fraility means it is easily OHKOed if it can't KO its target, so Knock Off support from Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Stunky can help chip down the opposing team for Alolan Diglett. U-turn from Mienfoo, Grookey, and Vullaby can help Alolan Diglett come onto the battlefield to start attacking. Alolan Diglett struggles with bulky physical walls like Mudbray and Grass-types like Grookey and Toedscool, so Pokemon that can deal with these threats like Hisuian Voltorb and Hisuian Growlithe make great partners.</p>"

Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that hits Mareanie, Glimmet, and Voltorb. Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble.

Psychic Fangs deters more reliable switch-ins to Hisuian Growlithe's STAB moves, hitting Mienfoo and Mareanie. Psychic Fangs also has the additional benefit of breaking screens, something that may hinder Hisuian Growlithe's wallbreaking. The final slot is flexible, with Rock Blast offering a lower-power alternative to Head Smash, with better accuracy and more PP that also beats Terastalized Weak Armor Vullaby. Stealth Rock allows Growlithe to provide role compression to offensive teams through offering entry hazard support, while Sleep Talk lets it sponge Spore from Foongus and still pose a threat. Tera Fire provides a stronger Flare Blitz to power through other bulky checks like Mudbray and the aforementioned Mienfoo.</p> <p>Much like many other wallbreakers in the tier, Hisuian Growlithe prefers having hazards off the field as much as possible. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Vullaby and Toedscool enable it to get in frequently, with the former also able to provide pivoting support and the latter providing Spore support.

Stealth Rock helps rack up passive damage on opposing Pokemon, while Flame Charge is sometimes chosen for a more offensive approach to make up for Hisuian Growlithe's middling Speed. Will-O-Wisp helps punish common switch-ins like Mienfoo and Mudbray, while Substitute is a safe way to scout for switches and catch Sucker Punch from opposing Pawniard and Stunky. Tera Fire boosts Flare Blitz's damage, allowing it to 2HKO offensive Mudbray, and removes Hisuian Growlithe's weakness to Fighting, while Tera Flying turns Hisuian Growlithe's weaknesses to Ground and Fighting into resistances.</p> <p>Hisuian Growlithe enjoys VoltTurn support from teammates such as Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb, which in turn enjoy Hisuian Growlithe's ability to nuke Pokemon like Foongus and Pawniard. Landing a Will-O-Wisp on prominent physical attackers like Mienfoo and Mudbray is greatly appreciated by setup sweepers such as Shellder, which appreciate not taking as much damage on setup turns.

With Skill Link, its coverage options Icicle Spear and Rock Blast can do even more damage than Liquidation to most neutral targets. Icicle Spear allows it to hit Grass-types super effectively, Rock Blast deals neutral damage to Water-types, and both allow it to OHKO Vullaby. If Shellder uses Tera Water, Liquidation can OHKO Pawniard after Stealth Rock and a boost and become Shellder's most powerful attack. If Shellder instead uses Tera Ghost, it will be immune or resistant to many forms of priority, including Mienfoo’s Fake Out, Timburr's Mach Punch, and Trapinch's First Impression.</p> <p>Shellder can fit on either hyper offense or bulky offense teams. Damage mitigation provided by dual screens from Impidimp, Will-O-Wisp from Gastly, and Memento users such as Stunky can ensure safer setup and, in Reflect's case, weaken priority moves. On hyper offense teams with dual screens or multiple Memento users, sweepers such as Magby and Nasty Plot Vullaby can break alongside Shellder, trying to either break common counters like Pawniard, force out opponents Terastallization, or set up on each other's counters such as Mienfoo. A team that can make significant progress for Shellder early- and mid-game is necessary when Shellder is used on a bulky offense team, since it is usually the main late-game wincon on these teams. Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Vullaby are very effective at damaging the enemy team as well as switching into other Pokemon, while Memento Stunky has defensive utility, can break, and can provide safe setup for Shellder. After setup, Shellder is weak to priority moves like Pawniard's Sucker Punch, defensive Terastallization, and the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier that it can't hit for super effective damage, including Mareanie, Snubbull, and more.</p>"

Thunder Wave is a useful tool to hinder opponents, potentially giving Snubbull and its teammates free turns.

Tera Psychic is the most common Tera type to enable Gothita to secure earlier KOes such as OHKOing a healthy Mienfoo.</p> <p>Gothita fits best on bulky offense or balance teams with other pivots, most notably Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb, which typically struggle against bulky Regenerator Pokemon like Foongus and Mareanie. Choice Scarf Hisuian Growlithe also has significant synergy with Gothita, as bulky Fire resistant Pokemon such as Mareanie and Glimmet are vulnerable to being trapped. Gothita's biggest weaknesses are that it gives free entry to offensive Dark- and Steel-types after it secures a KO and that it lacks power by itself. Therefore, Gothita needs both a defensive backbone with teammates such as Mienfoo, Mudbray, and Glimmet to switch into Dark-types, as well as offensive threats and sweepers like Shellder and the aforementioned Hisuian Voltorb to break through defensive cores.</p>"

High Jump Kick is the STAB move of choice, as its additional Base Power and lack of defensive stat drops make it a superior option to Close Combat. Knock Off allows Mienfoo to make consistent progress by removing the Eviolites of even Pokemon that check it like Foongus and Koffing. U-turn capitalizes on the switches Mienfoo forces and generates offensive momentum while synergizing with Regenerator recovery to keep Mienfoo healthy. Fake Out is useful priority that can wear down opposing sweepers and Choice Scarf users and chip foes into KO range. Taunt is another option that lets Mienfoo block Foongus's Spore and prevent setup. Maximum Speed is preferred to outrun major threats like Vullaby and Hisuian Growlithe. Tera Water gives Mienfoo a host of invaluable resistances, most notably Torchic's Fire Blast and Shellder's Liquidation, while Tera Fairy is a more niche pick that counters opposing Mienfoo. Alternatively, you can use Tera Steel to resist Vullaby's Brave Bird and Stunky's Gunk Shot.</p> <p>Mienfoo's utility and versatility mean it fits well on virtually any team, but it pairs especially well with Vullaby thanks to its ability to beat Vullaby's checks like Pawniard and Hisuian Growlithe. Vullaby also handles Foongus, especially if running Overcoat, which Mienfoo otherwise struggles to damage. Snubbull is a great teammate in matches where preserving Mienfoo's Eviolite is necessary, as it can easily switch into opposing Mienfoo's Knock Off and punish it with Thief. Mienfoo can do little to opposing Snubbull, so it appreciates teammates like Mudbray and Diglett-A that do not fear Snubbull's Thunder Wave and can threaten it out. Gastly and Stunky cannot reliably switch into Snubbull, but both threaten it with powerful Poison-type STAB moves off of Mienfoo's U-turn.</p>"
