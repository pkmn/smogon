In particular, Rotom is an especially good partner due to the duo's type synergy and effective pivoting. Entry hazard setters such as Piloswine and Qwilfish also greatly appreciate Alolan Persian's ability to safely get them on the field. Other walls such as Altaria and Tangela benefit from Alolan Persian crippling targets such as Gurdurr and Sawk, which makes checking them easier, and bringing pivot support with Parting Shot, which also weakens opposing attackers.

Also, unlike many other Choice Scarf + Trick / Switcheroo users like Rotom, Gourgeist-S, and Manectric, Alolan Persian still outspeeds the entire unboosted tier besides Accelgor without its Choice Scarf, meaning it can often afford to lose the Choice Scarf. Foul Play is the main STAB move, as it doesn't rely on Alolan Persian's low Attack and lets it nail threats like Swords Dance-boosted Silvally formes and Choice Scarf Gourgeist-. Knock Off is a far weaker STAB move, but it can remove useful items like Choice Scarf from Rotom, which normally doesn't expect to get outsped by Alolan Persian and tries to chip it with Volt Switch. However, note that Knock Off has bad synergy with Switcheroo, and it shouldn't be used on checks Alolan Persian has given a Choice Scarf to. Fur Coat with maximum HP investment allows Alolan Persian to switch into physical attackers like Rapidash and Thwackey.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Alolan Persian fits mostly in offensive teams looking to improve their matchup against other offensive teams. Slow and strong wallbreakers like Lycanroc-N, Jynx, and Alolan Dugtrio appreciate safely coming through Parting Shot. Other defensive pivots like Clefairy, Articuno, and Uxie also make for great partners, defensively checking Alolan Persian's checks like Fighting-types and special attackers.

Physically defensive sets are also a viable option if a team is in desperate need of a physical wall.

Rhydon can also opt for Rock Blast over Stone Edge for a move with better accuracy and the ability to break past Substitutes of Rotom, Articuno, and Uxie. Swords Dance lets Rhydon set up on passive walls and force out Altaria more reliably as it would attempt to Roost stall Rhydon after landing a Toxic. Alternatively, Roar synergizes well with Stealth Rock and phazes foes like Alcremie and Uxie, thereby preventing Rhydon from becoming setup fodder. Toxic cripples physical walls such as Tangela and Gourgeist-S that often switch into Rhydon. 84 Speed allows Rhydon to outspeed Pokemon with base 50 Speed, such as Piloswine. 16 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature greatly increase Rhydon's power while also allowing for enough Special Defense investment to reliably check Rotom and Skuntank.</p> <p>Rhydon's 4x weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks means it must rely on teammates such as Tangela, Thwackey, and Altaria to switch in to such attacks. Qwilfish can form great hazard stacking cores with Rhydon, Qwilfish also having access to Taunt to shut down Defoggers. Gourgeist also serves as a good partner for Rhydon, as it can cover for Rhydon's Fighting-type weakness, while Rhydon can switch into Fire-type attacks.

Qwilfish makes for good partners, as it forms a solid hazard core with Rhydon, which also aids its wallbreaking attempts. Rhydon should be paired with pivots such as Rotom, Alolan Persian, and Uxie to provide safe setup opportunities.

Leaf Storm can be used instead for a powerful nuke, especially against Knock Off users like Sawk and Alolan Persian; the Special Attack drop isn't that crippling, as Tangela enjoys pivoting to regain HP with Regenerator.

Sludge Bomb lets Tangela threaten Grass-types such as Shiftry and Flapple, which take little from Tangela's other moves and are immune to Sleep Powder and Leech Seed. Synthesis is Tangela's most reliable recovery move, letting it more comfortably check Choice Band Sawk and Kangaskhan, but Leech Seed can be used as an alternative, providing recovery to Tangela and chipping down its checks. Sleep Powder lets Tangela neutralize a foe to make pivoting easier, whereas Toxic puts walls that can otherwise take advantage of Tangela, such as Miltank and Uxie, on a timer.</p> <p>Tangela is a great choice for many teams, ranging from stall to bulky offense, and it appreciates being paired with special walls such as  Stunfisk, Throh, and Clefairy.

However, those that can't directly remove Kangaskhan or pivot out such as Miltank, Altaria, and Tangela have to be warry of Whirlpool sets.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Kangaskhan's Fake Out is often punished by Rocky Helmet users like Miltank and Qwilfish as well as Flame Body and Static users like Coalossal, Rapidash, and Stunfisk, even though they cannot afford to switch into Earthquake. Furthermore, Kangaskhan's entry hazard vulnerability and induced recoil from Double-Edge causes it to lose valuable chunks of HP and limits its turns on the field.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster attackers, especially ones able to take a Sucker Punch like Gourgeist-S, Silvally-Dark, and Choice Scarf Sawk are able to force out Kangaskhan.

It is thus equally prepared to check faster attackers like Manectric and Rotom and break special walls like Articuno and Clefairy. Sucker Punch combines with Fake Out for additional priority damage, and it is especially warranted to check setup sweepers like Silvally formes. Earthquake hits Steel- and Rock-types like Galarian Stunfisk, Coalossal, and Rhydon, and it avoids adverse contact effects from Rocky Helmet Qwilfish. Scrappy is essential to prevent frail Ghost-types from switching in and blocking Qwilfish's Intimidate. Silk Scarf improves Kangaskhan's main attacks. Heavy-Duty Boots instead combats Kangaskhan's residual damage vulnerability on teams with unreliable entry hazard control. A Jolly nature allows Kangaskhan to revenge kill Rotom-S and Choice Band Sawk more reliably, while Adamant picks up more KOs, like against Clefairy.</p> <p>Entry hazards from Qwilfish, Coalossal, and Rhydon are invaluable to Kangaskhan, as it relies on the additional chip damage to stack with Fake Out and pressure more threats; Toxic Spikes from the first two is particularly potent. Another way to facilitate Fake Out is using defensive pivots such as Uxie and Alolan Persian; these teammates are also valuable switch-ins when Kangaskhan is targeted by Sawk, Silvally formes, and Basculin. In return, these pivots rely on Kangaskhan to break walls that they are outstalled by and to punish threats like Skuntank. Special wallbreakers like Jynx,  Skuntank, and Rotom break walls like Tangela and Rhydon that Kangaskhan struggles with. Fake Out and Sucker Punch won't deal with every faster threat, so a Choice Scarf user like Sawk or Rotom should clean and revenge kill alongside Kangaskhan.

The given EV spread allows Kangaskhan to outspeed Modest Alcremie and Timid Exeggutor while maximizing its special bulk. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item, since it allows Kangaskhan to bluff its offensive sets.</p> <p>This set should absolutely be run in conjunction with other physical attackers for two main reasons. First, physical wallbreakers like Swords Dance Silvally formes, Galarian Rapidash, and Thwackey love Kangaskhan luring in physical walls like Tangela, Rhydon, and Altaria and removing them. Second, regular Kangaskhan sets are also paired with these type of attackers in physical spam teams, and this can bait the opponent into thinking it is not the Trapper set.

Alternatively, Shedinja can run Swords Dance to work as a late-game wincon with Shadow Sneak. Poltergeist is the preferred STAB move due to being its strongest attacking move. Shadow Sneak is a viable alternative that can pick off weakened foes like Rotom and Froslass and hit Electric Terrain sweepers after they have consumed their Electric Seed.

However, Rhydon and Piloswine dislike Will-O-Wisp and Trick, and all of the aforementioned Pokemon do not enjoy switching into Choice Specs Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Despite Rotom having a decent Special Attack stat, it struggles to break past Pokemon with solid special bulk, as they can take a hit and retaliate. Throh can threaten Rotom immediately with Knock Off. Specially defensive walls such as Clefairy, Appletun, and Cryogonal are great long-term checks, as they have reliable recovery; Clefairy can also pivot into a revenge killer, while the latter two threaten Rotom immediately.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Non-Choice Scarf Rotom is very susceptible to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Sawk and Gourgeist-S. Faster Pokemon such as Rapidash and Froslass threaten Rotom. Pokemon with priority moves such as Thwackey and Kangaskhan can also threaten to revenge kill Rotom after some prior chip damage.</p>",

Volt Switch can be used to pick off weakened foes while also keeping momentum against potential switch-ins. Trick can be used once there isn't a need for Rotom's revenge killing purposes and punishes passive walls like Galarian Stunfisk and Articuno. Thunderbolt makes for a great cleaning move, as it is a stronger Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Rotom out. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp cripples opposing targets, namely physical Ground-types like Rhydon, Piloswine, and Galarian Stunfisk, while Defog is useful on teams that cannot fit entry hazard removal elsewhere.</p> <p>Rotom enjoys the luxury of being able to use Volt Switch as often as possible, so having a entry hazard remover such as Articuno, Altaria, or Coalossal is a good idea. Pairing Rotom with Pokemon that can deal with Ground-types like Poliwrath and Gourgeist-S is also recommended to achieve this goal. Rotom also benefits greatly from entry hazard support, as it wants to use Volt Switch often to force out common Pokemon like Qwilfish and Articuno and wear down common switch-ins such as Throh and Clefairy. Good examples of entry hazard setters include Miltank, Qwilfish, and Rhydon. Physically offensive threats such as Sawk, Rapidash, and Silvally-Dark benefit from Rotom's ability to bring them in safely after forcing out their checks. Rotom is great on VoltTurn cores and works well with other pivots such as Articuno, Silvally formes, and Thwackey.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and Ground-types such as Rhydon, Kangaskhan, Thwackey, and Piloswine, and it also boosts the power of Hex. Colbur Berry prevents Rotom from being KOed by Sawk's Knock Off, which gives Rotom a chance to cripple it with a burn, while Heavy-Duty Boots allows Rotom to avoid taking Stealth Rock damage when pivoting. Sitrus Berry can be used for more general increased longevity and is preferred over Leftovers due to the constant pivoting.</p> <p>Rotom is best used on bulky offense and balance teams that benefit from its ability to disrupt opposing teams and offer support with Defog. Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Thwackey, and Sawk that appreciate Rotom's ability to bring them in safely; and in return, they can make up for Rotom's lack of immediate power, as it is reliant on spreading burns in order to maximize its power. Offensive threats such as Rapidash, Ninetales, and Skuntank appreciate Rotom's ability to lure in Ground-types and cripple them with burns. Rapidash and Ninetales also benefit from Defog and Rotom forcing out Water-types like Poliwrath and Cramorant. Skuntank helps Rotom by checking faster Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-S and Choice Scarf Rotom and Dark-types like Shiftry and Thievul.

Volt Switch lets Rotom gain momentum on Water- and Flying-types and get out of bad matchups against threats such as Throh and Appletun. Trick can be used not only to immediately cripple the aforementioned specially defensive walls but also to punish Ground-types that may attempt to block its Volt Switch attempts, such as Stunfisk and Piloswine.</p> <p>Rotom is susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Silvally-Dark if it is locked into Shadow Ball; therefore, it is imperative to pair Rotom with Fighting- or Fairy-types such as Sawk, Gurdurr, Alcremie, and Clefairy. The aforementioned Fighting-types also benefit from Rotom's ability to break past physical walls such as Tangela and Uxie and can deal with Normal-types like Kangaskhan and Miltank so Rotom can use Shadow Ball more freely. Pivots such as Thwackey and Silvally formes make for great partners, as they can bring Rotom in safely and form a solid VoltTurn core.

U-turn enables Unfezant to pivot out against Stunfisk, Piloswine, and Klinklang, keeping momentum and chipping them. Quick Attack finishes off weakened faster foes like Jynx and Accelgor. Night Slash lets Unfezant OHKO Rotom. Facade instead becomes a very powerful STAB move if Unfezant gets statused. Super Luck gives it better chances to break through Double Dance Alcremie if it has gained a Defense boost prior.</p> <p>Unfezant fits well in offensive teams due to its great power, good Speed tier, and mediocre bulk. It struggles to break past sturdy Flying-resistant Pokemon like Klinklang and Coalossal and could potentially lose momentum against them. Water- and Electric-types pair particularly well, as Pokemon like Silvally-Water, Rotom, and Raichu can force them out with their STAB or coverage moves and bring Unfezant in safely with their pivot moves. In return, Unfezant can form a VoltTurn core with them and force out Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-S, which pressure them. Spikes users, such as Qwilfish and Coalossal, wear down its checks, many of which lack reliable recovery. Entry hazard control from the likes of Coalossal, Rotom, and Hattrem can ameliorate its Stealth Rock weakness. Special wallbreakers like Rotom, Exeggutor, and Jynx can overwhelm physical walls like Rhydon, Pyukumuku, and Miltank that Unfezant has difficulty breaking through.

While Unfezant's main attack is its powerful STAB Brave Bird, it can also use U-turn to pivot out of unfavorable matchups such as Klinklang, Miltank, Rhydon, and Galarian Stunfisk. Facade provides Unfezant with a strong secondary STAB option once it becomes inflicted by status, as tends to happen, usually by a stray Toxic or Static paralyzation. Super Luck synergizes well with Night Slash and is useful for breaking through certain bulky setup sweepers like Acid Armor Alcremie and Kee Berry Uxie.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Unfezant fits best on bulky offense teams that can wear down the opposing team so it can clean up. Unfezant can create a VoltTurn core with teammates such as Kabutops and Rotom that collectively weakens its checks. Unfezant could also create a Flying-type spam core with Silvally-Flying, which notably nails Rhydon and Coalossal with Surf. Unfezant also appreciates offensive teammates such as Rapidash and Poliwrath that can help combat Flying-resistant foes. Hattrem is a common sight on Flying-type spam teams, bouncing back Stealth Rock and nailing Rock-types or Steel-types with either Giga Drain or Mystical Fire. Because of Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock, as well as Unfezant's tendency to switch in multiple times per game, entry hazard removal from teammates such as Defog Rotom and Gurdurr is much appreciated.</p>"

Other common Ghost- and Dark-types such as Silvally-Dark, Rotom, and Skuntank are only checks due to taking significant damage from either Body Press or Shadow Ball, but they can outspeed and do significant damage to Cofagrigus.</p> <p><strong>Alcremie</strong>: Alcremie outspeeds Cofagrigus and resists its Body Press. Once Alcremie enters the playing field it can freely set up Calm Mind, thus countering Cofagrigus.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Manectric and Exeggutor can outspeed and threaten Cofagrigus with a 2HKO and OHKO respectively.</p> <p><strong>Setup Deterrents</strong>: Unaware Pyukumuku ignores the Defense boost from Body Press, heals off the negligible damage it does take, and can use Toxic on Cofagrigus; it can then Spite to remove Cofagrigus’s Rest PP. Other setup deterrents such as Encore from Liepard and Taunt from Qwilfish and Alolan Persian can stop Cofagrigus in its tracks. Perish Song Altaria can also trap and defeat Cofagrigus.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic from Altaria and Stunfisk can force Cofagrigus to Rest, while Tangela can use Sleep Powder.

Shadow Ball covers for the Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Uxie and Palossand and physical walls like Tangela and Qwilfish that its main offensive move in Body Press does not threaten. Rest is Cofagrigus's most reliable form of recovery and removes status. 84 Speed EVs allow Cofagrigus to outspeed Rhydon and Gurdurr. A Colbur Berry allows Cofagrigus to eat strong Dark moves like Silvally-Dark's Multi-Attack and Thievul's Dark Pulse, while a Chesto Berry prevents Cofagrigus from wasting two turns sleeping.</p> <p>Cofagrigus generally fits best on bulkier builds in need of a defensive sweeper. Cofagrigus appreciates Dark resistant-teammates like Skuntank, Silvally-Fighting and especially Alcremie due to its ability to cure status via Aromatherapy. It also appreciates a solid special wall, like Articuno or Clefairy. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish and Coalossal make it harder for Cofagrigus to be pivoted around. Cofagrigus can also appreciate physical walls like Tangela and Altaria to help it avoid hits from Gourgeist formes and common Toxic users.</p>"

Solid Rock combined with Carracosta's solid bulk lets it set up on foes carrying super effective moves like Rhydon, Articuno, and Cofagrigus. With Life Orb, Carracosta needs less preliminary damage on foes like Choice Scarf Rotom and Miltank to clean after a Shell Smash. On the flip side, White Herb makes Carracosta harder to KO, as it allows it to take hits better from the likes of Alolan Persian's Foul Play and avoid recoil and Defense drops. With a Naive nature, Carracosta is able to outspeed the likes of maximum Speed Miltank, Gourgeist-S, and Galarian Rapidash after a Shell Smash, and nuke them with Stone Edge, whereas a Naughty nature provides stronger damage on Aqua Jet, requiring less chip damage on Choice Scarf users like Sawk and Rotom.</p> <p>Carracosta fits best on offensive teams, most notably on setup spam teams with other wallbreakers such as Silvally-Dark and Galarian Rapidash that can weaken or take advantage of its checks. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish, Roselia, and Froslass is much appreciated to put walls and Choice Scarf users in range of Stone Edge and Aqua Jet, respectively.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have a particularly high Special Attack, leaving it outclassed by other bulky Choice Specs wallbreakers, like Poliwrath and Exeggutor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Stunfisk can use its typing and bulk to consistently switch into Klinklang. Static also dissuades Klinklang from using Gear Grind. If used carelessly, though, Toxic can cripple it. Other Electric-types like the Rotom formes, Morpeko, Raichu, and Manectric can check Klinklang offensively. The Rotom formes can inflict burn, Morpeko is able to accumulate Speed boosts with its powerful Aura Wheel, and the latter two have higher Speed and super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types like Rapidash and Ninetales can switch into Klinklang's Gear Grind and retaliate with a super effective attack, so long as they watch out for Toxic and Wild Charge. Rapidash and Coalossal have the added bonus of potentially burning Klinklang with Flame Body, although the latter is a less consistent switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: With its weakness to Fighting-types, Klinklang is forced out by threats like Sawk and Throh. Gurdurr can shrug off boosted attacks and fire back with Drain Punch and can even revenge kill a weakened Klinklang with Mach Punch. While it must be wary of Electric moves, defensive Poliwrath easily handles Gear Grind and can stop a sweep with Circle Throw. Choice Specs variants also effortlessly revenge kill it with Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Klinklang has a hard time getting past Steel-types, including opposing Klinklang. Because of its typing, Alolan Dugtrio is able to switch in and KO Klinklang despite its frailty. Galarian Stunfisk, while niche compared to regular Stunfisk, is even more physically bulky and is immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Persian</strong>: Thanks to its high Speed, insane physical bulk, and access to Foul Play, Alolan Persian is able to take a hit and threaten Klinklang. Its lack of recovery means that it can get worn down from repeated hits, though.</p> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: With its access to Foul Play and Prankster Will-O-Wisp, Sableye can frustrate Shift Gear Klinklang. However, its low bulk makes it vulnerable against Choice Band variants.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Qwilfish and Miltank, while not great answers, can significantly weaken Klinklang with Rocky Helmet's chip damage.

Even neutral targets like Altaria, Tangela, and Uxie are used as setup fodder due to Klinklang's Steel typing. Klinklang can use Substitute to block weaker hits and status, but Magnet Rise is an option to avoid Earthquake from Rhydon and Alolan Dugtrio. Toxic cripples the few counters that Klinklang has, including Rapidash, Alolan Persian, Sableye, and Stunfisk. Alternatively, Wild Charge hits Water-types like Qwilfish, Poliwrath, and Cramorant. With 156 Speed EVs, Klinklang outspeeds Choice Scarf Manectric after a Shift Gear boost. The additional EVs are invested in bulk, making it even more difficult for revenge killers like Thwackey and Kangaskhan to pick it off at low health.</p> <p>Klinklang fits on almost all types of teams, ranging from semi-stall to hyper offense, but is at its best when its counters get crippled over the long run. As a result, Toxic users like Miltank, Altaria, and Clefairy greatly assist Klinklang in wearing down counters like Rapidash and Stunfisk. In return, Klinklang threatens clerics like Alcremie and Articuno. Miltank and Clefairy also provide their own cleric support, healing Klinklang of any status it gets from Flame Body or Static. Klinklang also appreciates Knock Off support, removing crucial items from Rhydon and Tangela, as well as eliminating the chip damage from Rocky Helmet Miltank and Poliwrath. Thwackey, Alolan Persian, and Uxie are all good partners thanks to their ability to use Knock Off against Klinklang's checks.

Choice Band gives it the strength to immediately threaten walls like Alolan Persian, Rhydon, and Spiritomb. Wild Charge punishes bulky Water-types like Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Pyukumuku, and Volt Switch provides useful pivoting for other switch-ins including Rapidash and Gurdurr.

Its offensive capabilities are further accentuated by chip damage, so entry hazards from Pokemon like Rhydon and Piloswine are helpful. They make especially useful partners, as they threaten Klinklang's biggest checks like Rapidash and Stunfisk. Spikes support from Qwilfish or Coalossal also helps rack up damage. VoltTurn wallbreakers including Rotom, Thwackey, and the Silvally formes can further add momentum with their pivoting. This constant damage is also helpful for fast cleaners like Galarian Rapidash, Froslass, and Choice Scarf Sawk, who appreciate the wallbreaking ability of Choice Band Klinklang. Although it does have good Speed, Klinklang gets outsped and OHKOed by Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio and Ninetales, so revenge killers like Froslass and Manectric are essential for supporting Klinklang offensively.</p>"

By not holding an item, Gourgeist-XL weakens opposing Knock Off users and gains a Poltergeist immunity to beat opposing Gourgeist formes and Choice Band Froslass.</p> <p>Bulky offense and balance teams looking for a physically defensive behemoth that absorbs Knock Off well will highly benefit from Gourgeist-XL's presence. Gourgeist-XL's great matchup against Pokemon like Sawk and Thwackey is greatly appreciated by walls like Miltank, Rhydon, and Poliwrath. In return, these walls can absorb the Ghost-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks that directly threaten Gourgeist-XL. Miltank is an especially good partner, as it resists all three of those types and can use Heal Bell to cure Gourgeist-XL of status. Entry hazard removers including Altaria, Articuno, and Cramorant also cover Gourgeist-XL's weaknesses and prevent hazards from withering it down. Late-game cleaners like Klinklang, Silvally-Poison, and Jynx love Gourgeist-XL spreading status, wearing down foes to make sweeping easier. Gourgeist-XL's ability to absorb hits from revenge killers like Sawk, Alolan Dugtrio, and Gurdurr is great for wallbreakers like Thievul, Skuntank, and Lycanroc-Midnight who fear revenge killers.</p>"

Shadow Sneak makes Gourgeist-XL a potent revenge killer, picking off chipped foes like Froslass, Rotom, and Jynx. Synthesis keeps Gourgeist-XL healthy, allowing it to check Pokemon like Thwackey, Sawk, and Rotom throughout the game. To assist in its defensive versatility, Gourgeist-XL doesn't hold an item so that it can weaken Knock Off and be immune to Poltergeist from opposing Gourgeist formes and Froslass.</p> <p>Offensive teams that want a physical attacker that can take multiple hits love Gourgeist-XL's combination of offensive and defensive prowess. However, Poltergeist's item requirement gives it negative synergy with Knock Off teammates. It enjoys pairing with wallbreakers that can threaten the Flying-, Grass- and Fire-types that switch into Power Whip. Jynx, Silvally-Poison, and Rhydon serve as great partners as a result. Rhydon, alongside Qwilfish and Piloswine, also provide entry hazard support to make Gourgeist-XL's attacks more difficult to switch into. Although it has significant bulk, Gourgeist-XL's common weaknesses require defensive partners like Poliwrath, Rapidash, and Stunfisk. Miltank is particularly good, providing Heal Bell support and resistances to Ghost, Fire, and Ice. In return, Gourgeist-XL handles Fighting-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks while putting out offensive pressure.</p>"

Knock Off is also a useful fourth move to cripple switch-ins like Altaria and Tangela. Toxic is an option to put a timer on bulkier foes that resist Lurantis’s moves like Articuno but only compounds its weakness to opposing Poison-types. Setup support like Substitute and Safeguard can be useful, but Lurantis is often too slow to use these moves well and generally gains more advantage by simply using Leaf Storm or Superpower. Lurantis can also run a specially defensive set to check Rotom with the expectation that Superpower will then improve its Defense after one use. Heavy-Duty Boots is a good item for getting the most out of Defog, but Leftovers synergizes better with the high likelihood of staying in multiple turns to take advantage of Contrary. Leppa Berry can be used to remedy the PP issues Lurantis faces with Leaf Storm and Superpower and works especially well against Articuno's attempts to Pressure stall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pure Poison-types like Silvally-Poison resist Lurantis’s combo of Grass- and Fighting-type coverage, and others like Skuntank and Qwilfish resist just one of Grass or Fighting. Silvally-Poison and Skunktank can comfortably switch into even Knock Off variants of Lurantis, and all three Pokemon threaten Lurantis with super effective STAB Poison moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Articuno and Altaria resist Lurantis’s Grass STAB moves and Altaria resists Superpower too. Both Pokemon threaten Lurantis with STAB Hurricane and Articuno can even opt for a more accurate Freeze-Dry if needed. Roost also allows these Pokemon to stay healthy throughout a game, though Articuno must beware of Superpower when it loses its Flying typing and both Pokemon are significantly crippled by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rapidash, Ninetales, and to a lesser extent Coalossal all threaten Lurantis with Fire STAB moves. Rapidash and Ninetales can boost alongside Lurantis, and Rapidash's Flame Body can punish repeated uses of Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Jynx, Froslass, and Cryogonal generally fear Lurantis's attacks but with momentum can force it out with Ice Beam or Freeze Dry. Articuno threatens Lurantis similarly but with the added benefit of resisting Leaf Storm. Abomasnow can switch into Leaf Storm too and immediately threaten to OHKO Lurantis with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Lurantis is a slow Pokemon and Superpower only boosts it Defense stat, making it susceptible to super effective attacks targeting its Special Defense from faster Pokemon like Poliwrath, Cramorant, or Manectric.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Lilligant can set up Quiver Dances and strike with a super effective Pollen Puff. Tangela and Roselia can stall out Leaf Storm and threaten with Sludge Bomb. Gourgeist can 2HKO with Poltergeist and is immune to Superpower.

Superpower also benefits from Contrary, providing super effective Fighting coverage for Sap Sipper Miltank and Klinklang while also hitting Fire-types, Grass-types, and Articuno for neutral damage. Synthesis ensures Lurantis can remain healthy enough to repeatedly clear entry hazards or sustain itself for a Contrary sweep. 216 Speed EVs lets Lurantis outpace Adamant Rhydon and uninvested Alcremie.

Rhydon, Palossand, and Stunfisk all specifically have trouble defeating Lurantis, which opens opportunities for teammates like Silvally-Poison and Rotom which are usually stopped by these Pokemon. Lurantis struggles greatly against bulky Poison- and Flying-type foes like opposing Silvally-Poison and Altaria. Lurantis is also quite slow, so it is forced out by any faster Pokemon, such as Rapidash, Ninetales, Froslass, Jinx, and Articuno. Klinklang is a good partner because of its resistances and ability to OHKO Ice-types with an unboosted Gear Grind. In return, Lurantis handles Stunfisk, Galarian Stunfisk, and Palossand, all of which commonly shrug off Klinklang’s moves. Rapidash and Coalossal are good teammates too because they check offensive Fire- and Ice-types, and Lurantis can handle opposing Rock- and Ground-types in turn.</p>"

Often times lowering Speed investment isn't worth it on the Choice Specs set, though it can be worth considering on the defensive set. Appletun can opt for Leftovers over Eject Pack on its defensive set, though it becomes even more of a momentum sink and loses its ability to absorb Knock Off as easily; in exchange, it becomes a sturdier check against the physical Pokemon it's tasked to handle.

Choice Specs Appletun can opt for Giga Drain as a fourth move over Recover, giving Appletun health while still firing off powerful Grass-type STAB attacks. However, this can be easily punished by Grass-resistant switch-ins, making it a less consistent choice compared to the former two options.

    "sets": {"Belly Drum": {"description": "<p>Eiscue aims to use Substitute to facilitate safe setup and then use Belly Drum to activate its Salac Berry and setup to +6 Attack, making it faster than unboosted Pokemon under base 100 Speed with its Ice Face intact and letting it outpace nearly the entire tier if its Ice Face is broken. However, even at +6 Attack, it misses key OHKOs due to Icicle Spear's unreliable damage and is extremely easy to revenge kill with any faster special attacker or Choice Scarf Sawk, which ignore Ice Face. Use Crustle or Silvally formes as setup sweepers instead.</p>"}},

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Uxie and Miltank from setting entry hazards and foes such as Altaria and Rotom-S from recovering health or using Defog. Life Orb grants Morpeko the freedom to switch between its moves, but the recoil can bring it in range of priority moves such as Gurdurr's Mach Punch. Also, the decrease in damage output compared to Choice Band leaves Morpeko unable to reliably 2HKO Pokemon such as Altaria.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Piloswine, Rhydon, and Stunfisk are able to take most of Morpeko's attacks and force it out. However, they need to be healthy enough to tank a hit from Aura Wheel in Hangry Mode.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types such as Tangela and Appletun are able to take a hit from Morpeko and either cripple it with status or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: While they are unable to switch into Choice Band Aura Wheel, Morpeko struggles to break through physical walls such as Miltank and Altaria. Other physically bulky Pokemon such physically defensive Alcremie and Gurdurr are able to withstand an attack and OHKO Morpeko.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Morpeko is susceptible to revenge killers, especially priority users, due to its poor bulk. Priority users such as Kangaskan, Gurdurr, and Thwackey are to pick it off after it is weakened, while certain Choice Scarf users such as Sawk and Silvally are able to revenge kill Morpeko if it lacks a Speed boost.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Morpeko is a unique offensive threat thanks to its signature move Aura Wheel and typing giving it a resistance to common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom and Sucker Punch Shiftry. Aura Wheel gives Morpeko +1 Speed after each use, allowing it to outpace offensive threats like Rapidash and Choice Scarf Sawk to clean weakened teams late-game. Crunch provides Morpeko with a reliable Dark-type STAB move, hitting foes such as Gourgeist formes and Rotom. Seed Bomb is Morpeko's best coverage against opposing Ground-types, granting it a 2HKO against Piloswine and Rhydon after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Ground-types are able to play around Aura Wheel and must be eliminated before Morpeko can effectively clean. Water-types such Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Cramorant pair well with Morpeko, as they weaken Ground-types and benefit from Morpeko's ability to pressure Pokemon like Rotom and Articuno. Special attackers like Jynx and Choice Specs Exeggutor are also able to handle the aforementioned Ground-types and eliminate physically defensive walls such as Acid Armor Alcremie and Tangela. These special attackers also appreciate Morpeko weakening bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Pyukumuku.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Morpeko holds a niche as a Rapid Spin user on offensive teams, handling some common entry hazard setters such as Uxie and Qwilfish. It also threatens Ghost-types such as Rotom, and Gourgeist formes, which other Rapid Spin users such as Coalossal and Kabutops do not do as effectively. However, Morpeko has a poor matchup against other entry hazard setters, especially Ground-types such as Piloswine, Rhydon, and Stunfisk, which limit its effectiveness. Aura Wheel serves as Morpeko's strongest STAB move, hitting foes like Qwilfish, Cramorant, and Articuno in Full Belly Mode and Uxie and Rotom in Hangry Mode. Protect allows Morpeko to safely switch between its Full Belly and Hangry formes while also allowing it to scout moves from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Sawk. Parting Shot pairs well with the Speed boost provided by Aura Wheel and allows Morpeko to pivot from unfavorable matchups.</p> <p>Morpeko works best on offensive entry hazard stacking teams that appreciate its Rapid Spin and pivot support. Entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Coalossal, and Rhydon synergize well with Morpeko, the former checking Fighting-types such as Sawk and Fairy-types such as Clefairy; in return, Morpeko is able to handle foes like Rotom and Cramorant. Piloswine is able to wear down opposing Ground-types like Rhydon and set Stealth Rock. Wallbreakers like Jynx and Flapple appreciate Morpeko luring walls like Tangela and Altaria and bringing them in with Parting Shot. Attackers such as Kangaskan and setup sweepers such as Silvally-Poison enjoy Morpeko's Rapid Spin support.</p>"
