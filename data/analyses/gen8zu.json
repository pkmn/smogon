Due to Sweet Veil, Alcremie can turn non-Toxic Alolan Persian into setup fodder; Rest Alcremie can even turn Toxic Alolan Persian into setup fodder. While Clefairy hates Knock Off, Alolan Persian cannot meaningfully damage it in any way and fears heavy damage from its Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Alolan Persian's lack of recovery makes it extremely susceptible to residual damage, especially after losing its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Skunktank and Ninetales easily exploit Alolan Persian's low special bulk and reliance on Foul Play.</p>",

Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Kangaskhan and Jynx make good partners due to their ability to muscle through walls Alolan Persian struggles with such as Clefairy and Altaria; in turn it provides them with safe entry. In particular, Rotom is an especially good partner due to the duo's type synergy and effective pivoting. Entry hazard setters such as Piloswine and Qwilfish also greatly appreciate Alolan Persian's ability to safely get them on the field. Other walls such as Altaria and Tangela benefit from Alolan Persian crippling targets such as Gurdurr and Sawk, which makes checking them easier, and bringing pivot support with Parting Shot, which also weakens opposing attackers.

Also, unlike many other Choice Scarf + Trick / Switcheroo users like Rotom, Gourgeist-S, and Manectric, Alolan Persian still outspeeds the entire unboosted tier besides Accelgor without its Choice Scarf, meaning it can often afford to lose the Choice Scarf. Foul Play is the main STAB move, as it doesn't rely on Alolan Persian's low Attack and lets it nail threats like Swords Dance-boosted Silvally formes and Choice Scarf Gourgeist-. Knock Off is a far weaker STAB move, but it can remove useful items like Choice Scarf from Rotom, which normally doesn't expect to get outsped by Alolan Persian and tries to chip it with Volt Switch. However, note that Knock Off has bad synergy with Switcheroo, and it shouldn't be used on checks Alolan Persian has given a Choice Scarf to. Fur Coat with maximum HP investment allows Alolan Persian to switch into physical attackers like Rapidash and Thwackey.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Alolan Persian fits mostly in offensive teams looking to improve their matchup against other offensive teams. Slow and strong wallbreakers like Lycanroc-N, Jynx, and Alolan Dugtrio appreciate safely coming through Parting Shot.

Swords Dance lets Rhydon set up on passive walls and force out Altaria more reliably as it would attempt to Roost stall Rhydon after landing a Toxic. Alternatively, Roar synergizes well with Stealth Rock and phazes foes like Alcremie and Uxie, thereby preventing Rhydon from becoming setup fodder. Toxic cripples physical walls such as Tangela and Gourgeist-S that often switch into Rhydon. 84 Speed allows Rhydon to outspeed Pokemon with base 50 Speed, such as Piloswine. 16 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature greatly increase Rhydon's power while also allowing for enough Special Defense investment to reliably check Rotom and Skuntank.</p> <p>Rhydon's 4x weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks means it must rely on teammates such as Tangela, Thwackey, and Altaria to switch in to such attacks.

Another way to facilitate Fake Out is using defensive pivots such as Uxie and Alolan Persian; these teammates are also valuable switch-ins when Kangaskhan is targeted by Sawk, Silvally formes, and Basculin. In return, these pivots rely on Kangaskhan to break walls that they are outstalled by and to punish threats like Skuntank.

Fake Out and Sucker Punch won't deal with every faster threat, so a Choice Scarf user like Sawk or Rotom should clean and revenge kill alongside Kangaskhan.

More immediately, these sets disregard the main reason to use Kabutops in the first place: compressing revenge killing with utility. Suicide lead sets do offer an additional niche option, as Kabutops has access to both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin. They use Weak Armor and Focus Sash, allowing Kabutops to survive any attack whilst potentially getting a Speed boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangela and Appletun can both switch into Kabutops and OHKO it with their STAB attacks. However, they can struggle against boosted Stone Edge from the rare Swords Dance set. Thwackey can also revenge kill Kabutops thanks to its priority Grassy Glide.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Sawk, Gurdurr, and Silvally-Fighting resist Stone Edge and can threaten Kabutops with their STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Sawk is faster than Kabutops, allowing it to revenge kill Kabutops reliably.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Rotom and Manectric outspeed Kabutops and can OHKO with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Poliwrath and Qwilfish are either immune or resistant to Kabutops's Water-type moves and Stone Edge doesn't 2HKO them. They can both have some form of recovery and can fish for Scald burns. Qwilfish can also cripple Kabutops with Thunder Wave.

Furthermore, special wallbreakers such as Jynx, Skuntank, and Thievul appreciate Kabutops luring in Pokemon such as Tangela and Qwilfish.

Toxic lets Miltank put foes with recovery like Tangela and Articuno on a timer, allowing it to win one-on-one. Toxic can also force Pokemon like Throh and Alcremie to use Rest later on. Heal Bell is the preferred option, helping its team against bulkier teams using a lot of status moves. Heavy-Duty Boots maximizes Miltank's longevity, giving it more switch-in opportunities; however, Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers, especially U-turn users like Thwackey and Silvally formes. Thick Fat is the preferred ability, letting Miltank handle Rapidash.

Toxic puts threats with reliable recovery like Alcremie, Articuno, and Cramorant on a timer. This set can notably hit Rotom with Toxic before it sets up a Substitute.

Both partners also resist Fire and Ice, which Roselia is vulnerable too. Psychic- and Flying-types are still problematic, however, so teammates such as Alolan Persian and Klinklang work well to help cover them. Kangaskhan works great as a teammate, reaping the benefits from entry hazard support by making Fake Out more threatening and taking advantage of the additional chip damage needed to 2HKO bulky foes such as Miltank and Tangela once its Eviolite is removed. Pawniard can help by using Knock Off to remove opponents Heavy-Duty Boots, in addition to threatening entry hazard removers such as Articuno and Altaria thanks to Defiant.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Rotom gain momentum on Water- and Flying-types and get out of bad matchups against threats such as Throh and Appletun.

The aforementioned Fighting-types also benefit from Rotom's ability to break past physical walls such as Tangela and Uxie and can deal with Normal-types like Kangaskhan and Miltank so Rotom can use Shadow Ball more freely. Pivots such as Thwackey and Silvally formes make for great partners, as they can bring Rotom in safely and form a solid VoltTurn core.

It struggles to break past sturdy Flying-resistant Pokemon like Klinklang and Coalossal and could potentially lose momentum against them. Water- and Electric-types pair particularly well, as Pokemon like Silvally-Water, Rotom, and Raichu can force them out with their STAB or coverage moves and bring Unfezant in safely with their pivot moves. In return, Unfezant can form a VoltTurn core with them and force out Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-S, which pressure them. Spikes users, such as Qwilfish and Coalossal, wear down its checks, many of which lack reliable recovery. Entry hazard control from the likes of Coalossal, Rotom, and Hattrem can ameliorate its Stealth Rock weakness. Special wallbreakers like Rotom, Exeggutor, and Jynx can overwhelm physical walls like Rhydon, Pyukumuku, and Miltank that Unfezant has difficulty breaking through.

Unfezant also appreciates offensive teammates such as Rapidash and Poliwrath that can help combat Flying-resistant foes. Hattrem is a common sight on Flying-type spam teams, bouncing back Stealth Rock and nailing Rock-types or Steel-types with either Giga Drain or Mystical Fire. Because of Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock, as well as Unfezant's tendency to switch in multiple times per game, entry hazard removal from teammates such as Defog Rotom and Gurdurr is much appreciated.</p>"

Cofagrigus appreciates Dark resistant-teammates like Skuntank, Silvally-Fighting and especially Alcremie due to its ability to cure status via Aromatherapy. It also appreciates a solid special wall, like Articuno or Clefairy. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish and Coalossal make it harder for Cofagrigus to be pivoted around.

Solid Rock combined with Carracosta's solid bulk lets it set up on foes carrying super effective moves like Rhydon, Articuno, and Cofagrigus. With Life Orb, Carracosta needs less preliminary damage on foes like Choice Scarf Rotom and Miltank to clean after a Shell Smash. On the flip side, White Herb makes Carracosta harder to KO, as it allows it to take hits better from the likes of Alolan Persian's Foul Play and avoid recoil and Defense drops. With a Naive nature, Carracosta is able to outspeed the likes of maximum Speed Miltank, Gourgeist-S, and Galarian Rapidash after a Shell Smash, and nuke them with Stone Edge, whereas a Naughty nature provides stronger damage on Aqua Jet, requiring less chip damage on Choice Scarf users like Sawk and Rotom.</p> <p>Carracosta fits best on offensive teams, most notably on setup spam teams with other wallbreakers such as Silvally-Dark and Galarian Rapidash that can weaken or take advantage of its checks. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish, Roselia, and Froslass is much appreciated to put walls and Choice Scarf users in range of Stone Edge and Aqua Jet, respectively.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have a particularly high Special Attack, leaving it outclassed by other bulky Choice Specs wallbreakers, like Poliwrath and Exeggutor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Stunfisk can use its typing and bulk to consistently switch into Klinklang. Static also dissuades Klinklang from using Gear Grind. If used carelessly, though, Toxic can cripple it. Other Electric-types like the Rotom formes, Morpeko, Raichu, and Manectric can check Klinklang offensively. The Rotom formes can inflict burn, Morpeko is able to accumulate Speed boosts with its powerful Aura Wheel, and the latter two have higher Speed and super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types like Rapidash and Ninetales can switch into Klinklang's Gear Grind and retaliate with a super effective attack, so long as they watch out for Toxic and Wild Charge. Rapidash and Coalossal have the added bonus of potentially burning Klinklang with Flame Body, although the latter is a less consistent switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: With its weakness to Fighting-types, Klinklang is forced out by threats like Sawk and Throh. Gurdurr can shrug off boosted attacks and fire back with Drain Punch and can even revenge kill a weakened Klinklang with Mach Punch. While it must be wary of Electric moves, defensive Poliwrath easily handles Gear Grind and can stop a sweep with Circle Throw. Choice Specs variants also effortlessly revenge kill it with Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Klinklang has a hard time getting past Steel-types, including opposing Klinklang. Because of its typing, Alolan Dugtrio is able to switch in and KO Klinklang despite its frailty. Galarian Stunfisk, while niche compared to regular Stunfisk, is even more physically bulky and is immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Persian</strong>: Thanks to its high Speed, insane physical bulk, and access to Foul Play, Alolan Persian is able to take a hit and threaten Klinklang. Its lack of recovery means that it can get worn down from repeated hits, though.</p> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: With its access to Foul Play and Prankster Will-O-Wisp, Sableye can frustrate Shift Gear Klinklang. However, its low bulk makes it vulnerable against Choice Band variants.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Qwilfish and Miltank, while not great answers, can significantly weaken Klinklang with Rocky Helmet's chip damage.

Even neutral targets like Altaria, Tangela, and Uxie are used as setup fodder due to Klinklang's Steel typing. Klinklang can use Substitute to block weaker hits and status, but Magnet Rise is an option to avoid Earthquake from Rhydon and Alolan Dugtrio. Toxic cripples the few counters that Klinklang has, including Rapidash, Alolan Persian, Sableye, and Stunfisk. Alternatively, Wild Charge hits Water-types like Qwilfish, Poliwrath, and Cramorant. With 156 Speed EVs, Klinklang outspeeds Choice Scarf Manectric after a Shift Gear boost. The additional EVs are invested in bulk, making it even more difficult for revenge killers like Thwackey and Kangaskhan to pick it off at low health.</p> <p>Klinklang fits on almost all types of teams, ranging from semi-stall to hyper offense, but is at its best when its counters get crippled over the long run. As a result, Toxic users like Miltank, Altaria, and Clefairy greatly assist Klinklang in wearing down counters like Rapidash and Stunfisk. In return, Klinklang threatens clerics like Alcremie and Articuno. Miltank and Clefairy also provide their own cleric support, healing Klinklang of any status it gets from Flame Body or Static. Klinklang also appreciates Knock Off support, removing crucial items from Rhydon and Tangela, as well as eliminating the chip damage from Rocky Helmet Miltank and Poliwrath. Thwackey, Alolan Persian, and Uxie are all good partners thanks to their ability to use Knock Off against Klinklang's checks.

Its offensive capabilities are further accentuated by chip damage, so entry hazards from Pokemon like Rhydon and Piloswine are helpful. They make especially useful partners, as they threaten Klinklang's biggest checks like Rapidash and Stunfisk. Spikes support from Qwilfish or Coalossal also helps rack up damage. VoltTurn wallbreakers including Rotom, Thwackey, and the Silvally formes can further add momentum with their pivoting. This constant damage is also helpful for fast cleaners like Galarian Rapidash, Froslass, and Choice Scarf Sawk, who appreciate the wallbreaking ability of Choice Band Klinklang. Although it does have good Speed, Klinklang gets outsped and OHKOed by Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio and Ninetales, so revenge killers like Froslass and Manectric are essential for supporting Klinklang offensively.</p>"

Yawn discourages other leads like Froslass and opposing Accelgor from setting up their own entry hazards. Infestation traps passive Pokemon like Stunfisk and Clefairy trying to provide utility early-game; it can then lock these Pokemon into their status moves with Encore and set up multiple layers of Spikes reliably. Focus Sash allows Accelgor to be nearly guaranteed to set up a layer of Spikes, while Unburden allows Accelgor to outspeed the entire metagame after being hit with Knock Off or losing its Focus Sash. Sticky Hold is an alternative that prevents it from getting hit by Trick.</p> <p>Accelgor is best suited as the lead slot on offense and hyper offense builds, where offensive Pokemon can capitalize on the entry hazards it sets.

Gourgeist-S is also a great fit on offense, as VoltTurn users like Klinklang and the Silvally formes greatly appreciate its ability to switch into and revenge kill threats. In return, those teammates can chip down the opposing team to make revenge killing easier, especially with Spikes support from Qwilfish. On offense, Gourgeist-S's ability to revenge kill fast threats like Alolan Dugtrio and Choice Scarf Sawk gives more room for sweepers like Silvally-Dark, Jynx, and Klinklang to take over the game.</p>"

It also easily handles passive attacks from the likes of Qwilfish and Stunfisk, although it should watch for paralysis. Its strong dual STAB attacks are difficult to switch into, breaking through common walls like Alcremie, Altaria, and Poliwrath.

For example, Stealth Rock gives it a good chance to 2HKO Skuntank. Defensive Stealth Rock setters including Stunfisk and Clefairy help keep hazards up over the course of a game. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon and Piloswine particularly help, though, because they can KO the Defog users like Articuno and Altaria that Gourgeist-S can sometimes struggle against. Gourgeist-S is capable at breaking through the defensive Water-types and Ground-types that dominate the tier, giving Pokemon like Rapidash and Klinklang a greater chance of sweeping. With frequent Choice locks but no Synthesis or Speed boost, a good defensive backbone can help preserve Gourgeist-S's longevity. Poliwrath, Miltank, and Throh all provide the necessary type synergy and bulk to give it a Pokemon to fall back on. VoltTurn users like the Silvally formes and Manectric can chip foes and lure in Pokemon that lose to Gourgeist-S, like Poliwrath and Altaria, before pivoting into it. Furthermore, wallbreakers like Jynx, Sawk, and Ninetales take advantage of Gourgeist-S's checks like Tangela, Miltank, and Rapidash.</p>"

However, this sacrifices a significant amount of bulk, making it less reliable as a physical wall or tank. Colbur Berry helps Gourgeist-XL become an incredible Knock Off absorber, and also lets it take a Multi-Attack from Silvally-Dark before attacking or burning it, at the cost of losing to Poltergeist users like opposing Gourgeist formes. Gourgeist-XL can set up Trick Room and take advantage of it, due to its great bulk and low Speed. However, Trick Room is a niche playstyle and requires much more team support than Gourgeist-XL's standard sets. Choice Band maximizes Gourgeist-XL's strength, but faces severe competition from Trevenant, Thwackey, and Gourgeist-S.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Albeit not fragile, Gourgeist-XL lacks the special bulk to consistently handle multiple hits from special attackers. They can't switch into it, and they should watch out for Shadow Sneak, but wallbreakers like Rotom and Jynx can hit it with strong super effective coverage. There also are breakers like Exeggutor and Appletun who hit it hard with neutral coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Rapidash and Ninetales resist Power Whip and immediately threaten it, although Poltergeist can be scary to switch into for Ninetales and a weakened Rapidash. Coalossal is neutral to Power Whip, but has super effective STAB moves and Flame Body to cripple Gourgeist-XL.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Gourgeist-XL may handle Knock Off decently, but its weakness makes it vulnerable to attacks from Silvally-Dark and Thievul. Alolan Persian has the physical bulk to handle its attacks and can weaken it with Toxic, Foul Play, or Parting Shot. Skuntank has the rare trait of resisting both of its STAB moves, and can immediately threaten Gourgeist-XL without worrying about status.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Although Poltergeist can hit them hard, Articuno, Altaria, and Silvally-Flying can switch into Power Whip and directly threaten Gourgeist-XL with their super effective STAB moves. While it dislikes being burned, Unfezant is additionally immune to Poltergeist.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper Normal-types</strong>: Miltank and Bouffalant can use Sap Sipper to completely wall both of Gourgeist-XL's STAB attacks. They should be careful to not switch into Toxic, and Bouffalant gets crippled by Will-O-Wisp, but most Miltank run Heal Bell to negate this.</p>",

Foul Play is the primary attacking option due to its ability to hit a wide range of attackers, including Piloswine and Klinklang, and the fact that nothing is immune to it. Toxic is a great way to pressure walls like Alcremie, Tangela, and Miltank, while Will-O-Wisp is another option that cripples physical foes like Qwilfish and Silvally-Dark who may try to switch into it. Power Whip is a powerful attack that destroys bulky Pokemon like Stunfisk, Rhydon, and Piloswine. Leech Seed makes Gourgeist-XL less reliable against the aforementioned Ground-types, but it provides consistent chip damage and recovery, making it less reliant on Synthesis. By not holding an item, Gourgeist-XL weakens opposing Knock Off users and gains a Poltergeist immunity to beat opposing Gourgeist formes and Choice Band Froslass.</p> <p>Bulky offense and balance teams looking for a physically defensive behemoth that absorbs Knock Off well will highly benefit from Gourgeist-XL's presence. Gourgeist-XL's great matchup against Pokemon like Sawk and Thwackey is greatly appreciated by walls like Miltank, Rhydon, and Poliwrath. In return, these walls can absorb the Ghost-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks that directly threaten Gourgeist-XL. Miltank is an especially good partner, as it resists all three of those types and can use Heal Bell to cure Gourgeist-XL of status. Entry hazard removers including Altaria, Articuno, and Cramorant also cover Gourgeist-XL's weaknesses and prevent hazards from withering it down. Late-game cleaners like Klinklang, Silvally-Poison, and Jynx love Gourgeist-XL spreading status, wearing down foes to make sweeping easier. Gourgeist-XL's ability to absorb hits from revenge killers like Sawk, Alolan Dugtrio, and Gurdurr is great for wallbreakers like Thievul, Skuntank, and Lycanroc-Midnight who fear revenge killers.</p>"

Rhydon, alongside Qwilfish and Piloswine, also provide entry hazard support to make Gourgeist-XL's attacks more difficult to switch into.

Knock Off is also a useful fourth move to cripple switch-ins like Altaria and Tangela. Toxic is an option to put a timer on bulkier foes that resist Lurantis’s moves like Articuno but only compounds its weakness to opposing Poison-types. Setup support like Substitute and Safeguard can be useful, but Lurantis is often too slow to use these moves well and generally gains more advantage by simply using Leaf Storm or Superpower. Lurantis can also run a specially defensive set to check Rotom with the expectation that Superpower will then improve its Defense after one use. Heavy-Duty Boots is a good item for getting the most out of Defog, but Leftovers synergizes better with the high likelihood of staying in multiple turns to take advantage of Contrary. Leppa Berry can be used to remedy the PP issues Lurantis faces with Leaf Storm and Superpower and works especially well against Articuno's attempts to Pressure stall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pure Poison-types like Silvally-Poison resist Lurantis’s combo of Grass- and Fighting-type coverage, and others like Skuntank and Qwilfish resist just one of Grass or Fighting.

Abomasnow can switch into Leaf Storm too and immediately threaten to OHKO Lurantis with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Lurantis is a slow Pokemon and Superpower only boosts it Defense stat, making it susceptible to super effective attacks targeting its Special Defense from faster Pokemon like Poliwrath, Cramorant, or Manectric.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Lilligant can set up Quiver Dances and strike with a super effective Pollen Puff. Tangela and Roselia can stall out Leaf Storm and threaten with Sludge Bomb. Gourgeist can 2HKO with Poltergeist and is immune to Superpower.

Hattrem is also a great partner, preventing Stealth Rock thanks to Magic Bounce and providing Healing Wish, which is great for offensive teams. Electric-type foes that threaten Silvally-Flying such as Rotom and Manectric can be covered by Stealth Rock setters in Rhydon and Piloswine. Fire-type Pokemon such as Rapidash and Ninetales can help cover the Ice weakness, in addition to Steel-types like Klinklang. Neither covers these weaknesses perfectly, however, due to Alolan Dugtrio and Piloswine threatening them out. A bulky Water-type such as Poliwrath fill in these gaps. Pokemon such as Sawk, Rotom, and Thwackey appreciate wallbreaking from Silvally-Flying opening up a path for a late-game sweep.</p>"
