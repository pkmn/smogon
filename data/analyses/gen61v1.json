      "Fake Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fake Out breaks Sturdy and Multiscale against Pokemon such as Aggron, Magnezone, and Dragonite; next to that, it gives Mega Medicham just that little bit of damage to get KOs with its stronger attacks. High Jump Kick KOs Pokemon like Heatran, Meloetta, and Manaphy after a Fake Out. Giga Impact helps against bulky Volcarona, non-Choice Scarf Victini, and Mega Gardevoir. Bulk Up is useful against bulky variants of Mega Metagross, as well as Mega Aggron and Rhyperior. Poison Jab OHKOes Mega Gardevoir and Whimsicott. Endure gets around Pokemon that use recharge moves like Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Porygon-Z. It can also be used for those with Endure + Custap Berry like offensive Manaphy. Zen Headbutt deals with Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Heracross. Ice Punch is there for those weak to Ice, like non-Choice Scarf Dragonite and Landorus-T. Thunder Punch gives Mega Medicham a better Mega Gyarados matchup.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is so that Mega Medicham outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Genesect and can Speed tie Manaphy, Mega Gardevoir, and other Mega Medicham. The four leftover EVs are put into Special Defense so that Download from Genesect gives an Attack boost instead of Special Attack. An Adamant nature can be run for more firepower, which helps against Volcarona, fast Mega Metagross, and Victini when using Giga Impact.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Mega Medicham is pretty straightforward; you always use Fake Out the first turn, followed by the strongest move possible. By using Fake Out, you can estimate the foe's HP and defensive EVs, which is helpful for Pokemon that run different sets. Greninja is an example; while Torrent Greninja runs Defense EVs, Choice Specs Greninja does not; knowing its set helps you decide whether to use an attack or Endure.</p>"

Serperior may use Worry Seed, stopping Registeel from using Rest by replacing its ability with Insomnia. Worry Seed also beats Mega Mawile by removing Huge Power and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria by removing Pixilate. Taunt beats stall Pokemon as well and gains other matchups such as Taunt Mega Aggron and Shell Smash Crustle. These moves, because they require dropping Protect, often lose more matchups than Worry Seed or Taunt will gain. Serperior can also use Occa Berry over Leftovers for Fire-types like Choice Specs or Weakness Policy Victini and non-Choice Scarf Heatran; this, however, loses out on the Leftovers recovery, which is pivotal in allowing Serperior to stall out Pokemon indefinitely.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Serperior uses its great Speed tier to set Leech Seed and gain passive recovery at the end of the turn. Then, Serperior alternates between Protect and Substitute, chipping the opponent and stalling turns; this allows it to beat many top threats, such as Garchomp and Mega Metagross. To round out the set, Serperior uses Leaf Storm, which gains power with each use thanks to Contrary; this allows Serperior to beat stall Pokemon, such as Mega Sableye, Manaphy, and Mega Slowbro.</p> <h4>EVs</h4> <p>Serperior needs maximum Speed investment to outspeed base-110 Speed threats, most notably Mega Diancie, Mega Metagross, and non-Choice Scarf Archeops; this lets it fare well against other Serperior. The HP and Defense investment allows it to take an Outrage from Jolly Choice Band Garchomp while maximizing its HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Versus Sableye, Serperior can use Protect on turn one to avoid Taunt, which will still be a priority move due to Prankster when they Mega Evolve. This will allow Serperior to get a Substitute off against Mega Sableye to avoid potential Metal Burst damage. If they use Calm Mind, use Leaf Storm. However, if they choose not to Mega Evolve, they preserve Prankster Taunt, and the matchup becomes a toss-up between Leaf Storm on Taunt or Substitute on Metal Burst. However, it should be noted that many Sableye do not carry Metal Burst. Versus various targets that are weak to Grass, such as Mega Diancie, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Slowbro, Serperior should use Leaf Storm repeatedly instead of setting Leech Seed. In most other matchups, using Leech Seed on turn one before alternating between Protect and Substitute provides the best chances of winning, provided Serperior survives the foe's initial attack.</p>"
