        "description": "<p>Mega Venusaur's great overall stats and ability make it a powerful tank in the metagame, capable of checking staples like Clefable, Rotom-W, and Zeraora while providing excellent offensive pressure, since Sludge Bomb, Knock Off, and Earth Power can cripple or threaten the majority of its checks, like Mega Latias, Aegislash, and Celesteela. Giga Drain can be used to threaten Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon immediately, but Leech Seed is also an option to annoy and force out checks like Celesteela and Skarmory while providing another source of recovery for itself and teammates. Earth Power allows it to hit Fire-types like Iron Moth and Skeledirge and Steel-types like Aegislash and Excadrill. Hidden Power Fire prevents Skarmory from setting up Spikes and Scizor from using Mega Venusaur as setup fodder while still hitting most Steel-types super effectively, even if it's less effective than Earth Power. The given EV spread allows it to outspeed Modest Celesteela and Adamant Tyranitar. Mega Venusaur fits on several archetypes, from offense to balance. Partners like Clefable, Scizor, and Excadrill enjoy Leftovers from Celesteela and Skarmory being removed; Scizor provides priority and a check against faster threats like Alakazam, Iron Boulder, and Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable can use Thunder Wave to cripple Iron Moth or Alakazam. Skarmory can set up Spikes against Mega Venusaur when the latter is not running Hidden Power Fire, so entry hazard removal from Rotom-W and Excadrill or dedicated counters like Magnezone are great partners. Mega Venusaur's vulnerability to entry hazards also make Rotom-W or other entry hazard control options really useful; Rotom-W can also pivot Mega Venusaur in against Clefable, Hydrapple, and Tangrowth.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Despite Mega Beedrill initially seeming like a good Pokemon thanks to its exceptional Attack and Speed stats, great ability in Adaptability, and access to U-turn, it is completely unviable. While U-turn can grab momentum against foes such as Hydreigon and Mega Latias, and Poison Jab has some utility in targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Bug and Poison is an atrocious STAB combination that has no way to break through common defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Buzzwole, and it notably struggles to even touch Steel-types. Skarmory and Celesteela stonewall Mega Beedrill, and while other Steel-types dislike Drill Run and Knock Off, virtually every Steel-type, from Bisharp to Excadrill, can usually beat Mega Beedrill one-on-one. As a pivot, Mega Beedrill suffers massively due to its Stealth Rock weakness and inability to hold Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes it very over-reliant on hazard control, or else it'd be worn down rapidly. Mega Beedrill's paltry defensive stats and terrible typing give it practically no defensive utility, rendering it extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Pursuit is another seemingly useful option, with its ability to outpace the likes of Victini and Mega Latias working well in tandem with Mega Beedrill's ability to hit them super effectively. However, Mega Beedrill is outclassed as a Pursuit trapper by Mega Aerodactyl and Tyranitar, both of which have a much better offensive and defensive presence thanks to their better typings. For teammates, entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tapu Fini are mandatory. Special attackers that can remove or chip physical walls, such as Iron Moth and Thundurus, are necessary to let Mega Beedrill have any hope of threatening the opposing team. Magnezone is notable for its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and Celesteela. Entry hazards from setters like Ting-Lu and Skarmory can chip Mega Beedrill's targets and help it actually KO its targets. Overall, Mega Beedrill is an offensive threat that loses to most foes and requires excessive amounts of support to function properly; thus, it is far too difficult to apply to standard teams to be considered viable.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With a seemingly infinite utility movepool, great typing, and excellent ability allowing it to be unbothered by entry hazards and most status, Clefable cements itself as one of the best defensive options in the tier, able to check significant threats like Mienshao, Buzzwole, and Hydreigon. It also helps its teammates play around certain support options, such as Rotom-W, Ting Lu, and Hippowdon and uses these opportunities to set entry hazards or annoy the enemy team with its utility options. Thunder Wave allows Clefable to cripple faster threats like Iron Boulder and Enamorus while also dissuading many of Clefable's checks such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela from switching in. Knock Off allows Clefable to leverage its numerous entry points to remove key items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from checks like Excadrill and Iron Moth. Flamethrower is a niche option typically only found alongside Calm Mind that helps Clefable better threaten Excadrill while also chipping Celesteela. Stealth Rock is generally preferred, as Clefable tends to outlast most hazard control options, like Rotom-W and Excadrill, due to Magic Guard. Calm Mind similarly takes advantage of its ability to be unfazed by Toxic, turning it into a resilient sweeper that can punish teams reliant on special attackers like Amoonguss and Volcanion to check it. Rocky Helmet allows Clefable to punish threats such as Mienshao that would otherwise use U-turn and overrun most teams in conjunction with hazards. Leftovers is an alternative that greatly improves Clefable's longevity against the rest of the tier and is especially potent alongside Calm Mind to allow Clefable to overwhelm checks like Mega Venusaur or Aegislash. While maximum Defense investment is recommended to help Clefable withstand physical attackers like Mienshao better, an alternative spread with 68 Special Defense EVs can be used to ensure Clefable always survives an unboosted Iron Moth Sludge Wave, allowing Clefable to cripple it with Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Because of Clefable's ability to handle many dangerous threats and stay healthy throughout the course of a game, it is found on every team style barring hyper offense. Teammates like Ting-Lu and Celesteela appreciate Clefable dealing with dangerous physical threats like Mienshao and Zeraora; in return, these partners can handle Iron Moth and Mega Venusaur for Clefable. Other defensive partners like Skarmory can pair nicely with Clefable to better handle Mienshao while also providing support against Excadrill and Scizor. Clefable is an adept Stealth Rock setter, which is appreciated by offensive teammates such as Zeraora, Choice Band Iron Boulder, Mienshao, and Iron Moth. In return, these attackers can threaten options Clefable cannot handle, such as Alakazam, Iron Moth, and Mega Venusaur while also racking up hazard damage onto the enemy team, allowing Clefable to outlast such checks. Clefable is also one of the best Knock Off absorbers in the tier, because it doesn't rely on its item to perform defensively, which allows it to support teammates weak to Knock Off like Skeledirge and Aegislash as well as Rotom-W and Celesteela, which simply dislike their Leftovers being removed.</p>"

Head Smash and Flare Blitz are the STAB moves of choice, as the Rock- and Fire-type coverage is only resisted by Water / Ground types like Quagsire. Close Combat hits Ting-Lu for super effective damage and is its strongest option to hit Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon. Extreme Speed can pick off frail threats that otherwise outspeed it such as Thundurus, Alakazam, and Iron Moth. Choice Band lets Hisuian Arcanine achieve 2HKOs on Pokemon like Ting-Lu. An Adamant nature can be used to maximize power, dealing significantly more damage to would-be switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Swampert, while a Jolly nature can be run to outspeed Pokemon like Excadrill and Rotom-W. While Hisuian Arcanine is potent at breaking through defensive teams, it often struggles to enter the field due to its poor defensive typing. As such, it appreciates the support of bulky pivots like Rotom-W, Scizor, and Slowbro. Bulky Ground- and Water-types like Quagsire, Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, and Slowbro can all switch in on Hisuian Arcanine, making Grass-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Giga Drain Mega Venusaur valuable partners. In return, Hisuian Arcanine can pressure Grass-resistant foes like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Buzzwole. When locked into its STAB moves, Hisuian Arcanine can provide free setup opportunities to dangerous revenge killers like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Gallade, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Keldeo. Thus, Hisuian Arcanine appreciates defensive pivots like Tapu Fini and Celesteela, which can stave off these threats. Tapu Fini and defensive Celesteela both benefit from Hisuian Arcanine threatening Grass-types like Tangrowth with Flare Blitz. Since Hisuian Arcanine cannot afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Excadrill is necessary for Hisuian Arcanine to function effectively. Hisuian Arcanine also appreciates entry hazard support to chip down defensive answers like Quagsire and Ting-Lu, so entry hazard setters like Excadrill, Gastrodon, and Skarmory are excellent partners for it.</p>"

These assets make it a great revenge killer or wallbreaker for offensive teams. It is able to outspeed and KO top-tier threats like non-Choice Scarf Mienshao and Iron Moth or break sturdy defensive cores with Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Mega Venusaur. Focus Blast is used to hit Dark- and Steel-types like Ting-Lu, Excadrill, and Celesteela. Shadow Ball hits Mega Latias, Aegislash, and Slowking. Recover allows Alakazam to set up in front of weaker attacks or passive Pokemon, such as Chansey. Encore locks Pokemon like Mega Latias, Clefable, and Excadrill into unfavorable moves, and Alakazam can use these free turns to set up. Counter is a niche option to KO Iron Boulder and Zeraora and should only be used with Focus Sash for its surprise factor, but it's way less useful than Alakazam's other moves in most matchups. Alakazam's choice of item depends on what your team needs the most; Focus Sash allows it to revenge kill fast Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Bisharp, while Life Orb or Fightinium Z allows it to pressure defensive staples like Ting-Lu, Celesteela, and Slowking with much more consistency. When not running Focus Sash, 28 Defense EVs should be used to avoid an OHKO from Hippowdon's Earthquake. Alakazam fits best on offensive teams that enjoy a fast revenge killer against Iron Moth and Mienshao. Entry hazard support from Ting-Lu, Greninja, and Iron Moth is effective at wearing down most of Alakazam's answers; Toxic Spikes from Iron Moth can put Ting-Lu on a timer, while Spikes can weaken Aegislash and force Scizor to use Roost more often. Magnezone can trap Celesteela and Scizor; in return, Alakazam threatens Mienshao and Buzzwole. Knock Off from Scizor or Clefable can remove Leftovers from Celesteela and Aegislash, and both appreciate Alakazam revenge killing Iron Moth for them.</p>"

As they're forced out, Slowbro can use Teleport to maintain momentum and stay healthy. Scald serves as a spammable STAB attack that can cripple targets with burns, dissuading otherwise decent checks like Tyranitar. Even foes that don't rely on physical attacks, like Hydreigon, tend to dislike the chip from burn. Future Sight supports wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Enamorus in breaking through their checks such as Tangrowth and Skarmory for the former two and Mega Venusaur for the latter. It also synergizes excellently with Teleport. Slack Off serves as reliable recovery that doesn't require Slowbro to switch out. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to avoid taking damage from entry hazards, maximizing HP regained from Regenerator, though Rocky Helmet can be held instead to punish contact move users, notably foes that run U-turn like Victini. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowbro as slow as possible, maximizing its odds of moving slower than opposing Teleport users. Slowbro best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a reliable defensive pivot that can also generate momentum for wallbreakers. Hazard-stacking teammates like Skarmory, defensive Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon pair up nicely with Future Sight, further putting pressure on opposing defensive cores. Many hazard-stacking teammates can also double as checks to Pokemon Slowbro struggles against, such as Clefable and Ting-Lu checking Dark-types like Hydreigon, Skarmory handling Bug- and Grass-types like Buzzwole and Tapu Bulu, and Hippowdon and Ting-Lu checking Electric-types like Zeraora. Similarly, pivots like Scizor also check threats like Clefable while pairing nicely with Slowbro's own pivoting potential to maintain offensive momentum. If it isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots, hazard control from teammates like Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Flygon is necessary.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Slowbro's increased physical bulk, reliable defensive typing, and access to Regenerator prior to Mega Evolving form a threatening setup sweeper with Calm Mind with the ability to easily cripple and outlast potential checks such as Assault Vest Tangrowth and Aegislash. However, Mega Slowbro struggles to justify a place over its regular forme because it becomes especially vulnerable to all forms of status and entry hazards given the inability to hold an item. Additionally, the opportunity cost of not being able to use items results in Mega Slowbro competing with other Mega Evolutions such as Latias and Venusaur, which offer more distinctive defensive features in comparison. Scald ensures Mega Slowbro is able to threaten physical attackers such as Iron Boulder and Excadrill and potentially cripple the likes of Scizor and Azumarill with its burn chance. Psychic is preferred to deal as much damage as possible to certain physically defensive Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, Hydrapple, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur, but Psyshock allows Mega Slowbro to match up better against Calm Mind sweepers such as Mega Latias and Reuniclus as well as certain specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Assault Vest Primarina. Slack Off gives Slowbro a complementary recovery option that allows it to instantly heal off damage from the likes of Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Enamorus, which it often finds itself pivoting into; it benefits Mega Slowbro in particular, which forgoes Regenerator. The given EV spread ensures Mega Slowbro isn't 2HKOed by unboosted attacks such as Iron Moth's Sludge Wave and Enamorus's Moonblast from full health, allowing it to find opportunities against them. Mega Slowbro fits best on balance and stall teams, where is able to complement its team's defensive security against threats such as Mega Gallade and Excadrill and find adequate opportunities to safely set up. Hazard support from defensive staples such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Blissey is vital to Mega Slowbro's gameplan, weakening offensive Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Aegislash dilutes their ability to deal with it in the long run. Additionally, Mega Slowbro also complements these Pokemon in return by providing a sturdy defensive check to some of the physical attackers that may overwhelm them, such as Victini and Mienshao. Mega Slowbro also dislikes having to contend with the opposing presence of various special threats; notably Alakazam, Hydrapple, and Hydreigon, which are capable of setting up and overwhelming it by targeting its lower Special Defense. Other examples that pair well with Mega Slowbro to check several of these Pokemon include defensive Scizor, Celesteela, and Unaware Clefable. Clefable is notable in particular, as it is also able to further support Mega Slowbro with tools such as Wish and Aromatherapy, keeping it healthy against potential status aliments such as Toxic from Hippowdon and Celesteela. While Mega Slowbro appreciates the increased defenses from Mega Evolving, there are also instances where it would prefer to utilize Regenerator in its base form, which makes hazard removal from Pokemon such as Flygon, Talonflame, and Excadrill crucial to ensure it isn't as vulnerable to certain attacks prior to Mega Evolving, such as Choice Band Tyranitar's Knock Off and Swords Dance Excadrill's boosted Earthquake.</p>"

Additionally, by virtue of its immunities to Seismic Toss and Toxic, Gengar serves as a major threat to stall teams packing special walls such as Blissey and Chansey, setting up on and breaking through them with ease. However, Gengar's offensive role outside of this is extremely limited; its lack of defensive utility and setup opportunities compared to other Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Blacephalon and other wallbreakers such as Iron Boulder and Thundurus makes it difficult to justify as a whole. Focus Blast forms perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Ball, allowing it to also threaten Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Hydreigon. Substitute takes advantage of the switches Gengar forces against Pokemon such as Skarmory and Slowbro while also protecting it from faster Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Zeraora that would otherwise revenge kill it. Alternatively, Sludge Wave allows Gengar to immediately threaten Unaware Clefable as well as OHKO Hydrapple and Assault Vest Tangrowth after a boost. Fightinium Z is preferred to power up Gengar's Focus Blast, allowing it to break past Ting-Lu, specially defensive Hippowdon, and Celesteela at +2 while temporarily offsetting Focus Blast's shaky accuracy, though Life Orb and Black Sludge are also viable options, should a different Z-Move user be preferred. Gengar fits best on offense and hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to threaten most defensive cores. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Mold Breaker Excadrill, Ting-Lu, and Swampert is crucial to help weaken Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo into Gengar's KO range. Additionally, Ting-Lu and Swampert can also use their defensive profile to check faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl that force Gengar out. Gengar appreciates being paired with physical teammates such as Mienshao, Scizor, and Zeraora, which can apply additional pressure to the likes of Celesteela and Hippowdon. Additionally, these attackers can also use U-turn and Volt Switch to provide Gengar with safe entry into physical walls for it to take advantage of, namely Buzzwole and Skarmory. Lastly, late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Enamorus, Autotomize Celesteela, and Booster Energy Iron Moth appreciate Gengar's ability to overwhelm special walls Pokemon such as Blissey and Celesteela, paving the way for them to sweep more efficiently; these teammates often capitalize on revenge killers typically sent out to handle Gengar such as Alakazam and Shadow Sneak Aegislash.</p>"

Seismic Toss is Chansey's most reliable way of dealing damage, letting it punish Toxic-immune targets like Iron Moth and Mega Venusaur while also ensuring Substitute users like Hydreigon and Enamorus cannot use Chansey as setup fodder. Soft-Boiled provides instant reliable recovery, but Wish alongside Protect is an option to grant Chansey increased recovery PP while also potentially passing massive Wishes to teammates. However, this comes at the cost of being more exploitable, as threats like Galarian Moltres and Thundurus can use Nasty Plot on forced Protect turns. Toxic restricts special sweepers like Calm Mind Enamorus and Mega Latias while also punishing physical attackers that switch in to threaten Chansey like Buzzwole and Tyranitar. Thunder Wave is an alternative on bulky teams that are less capable of handling setup sweepers like Aegislash to allow teammates like Ting-Lu to outspeed and KO them before they can retaliate. Given the number of opportunities Chansey gets to switch in, Stealth Rock is a great move for it, but Aromatherapy can be used on teams with another entry hazard setter to keep the team free from status. Given its weakness to hazards as well as its passivity, Chansey is typically only seen on stall and bulky teams. Chansey can struggle with many of the tier's most common physical attackers, particularly Tyranitar and Buzzwole, so teammates like Hippowdon and Skarmory are appreciated, and Chansey can check special threats that target them like Hydreigon and Iron Moth in return. Chansey also struggles with Fighting-types like Keldeo and Mienshao, so teammates like Mega Latias and Clefable are good partners. Teammates like Mega Venusaur and Mega Latias that can handle strong setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Thundurus are appreciated. In return, Chansey can help handle special threats that don't rely on setting up such as Choice Specs Enamorus and Hydreigon. Chansey's complete inability to touch Ghost-types without Toxic and staples like Aegislash even with Toxic is problematic, so reliable answers to these threats like Ting-Lu are appreciated. Chansey is threatened heavily by Knock Off, so good Knock Off absorbers like Buzzwole and Clefable are important alongside it, while Chansey can handle any special threats that might threaten them, including Galarian Moltres and Magnezone.</p>"

Earthquake provides Mega Aerodactyl with perfect neutral coverage, hitting Rock-resistant Pokemon as well as targets that are weak to it, such as Tyranitar, Zeraora, and Bisharp, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to threaten them. Dual Wingbeat provides a secondary STAB option that ensures Mega Aerodactyl hits important targets such as Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss super effectively. Taunt can be used instead to deny the likes of bulkier targets, such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Hippowdon, from accessing their healing moves, on top of shutting down setup options from specific setup sweepers, such as Mega Latias. Mega Aerodactyl can even serve as an effective Pursuit trapper; with the Tough Claws boost, it makes for an effective option to use against the likes of Iron Moth, Victini, and Alakazam. Roost is mandatory in the last slot to offset Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness while also allowing it to repeatedly switch into foes such as Iron Moth, resisting most of its attacks in the process. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Mega Aerodactyl's power, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Hydrapple with Dual Wingbeat after Stealth Rock while still getting the jump on Iron Boulder. However, a Jolly nature can be used to ensure Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Jolly Zeraora. Mega Aerodactyl fits best on bulky offense and balance teams in need of an offensive backbone with solid secondary defensive applications. Bulkier Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to relieve pressure in dealing with offensive threats which they may be overwhelmed by, such as Victini and Enamorus. In return, the former provides hazard support to help Mega Aerodactyl secure damage rolls against Pokemon it would otherwise miss out on, such as against Autotomize Celesteela with Stone Edge and Tyranitar with Earthquake, whereas the latter provides additional pivoting support, hazard removal in Defog to offset Mega Aerodactyl’s weakness to Stealth Rock, and the ability to take on several setup sweepers which it struggles to take on, such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Swords Dance Scizor. Similarly, other Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Excadrill and Mandibuzz, are effective at ensuring Mega Aerodactyl isn’t being dug into by Stealth Rock. On the other hand, offensive Pokemon such as Life Orb Mienshao, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Tapu Bulu can benefit from Mega Aerodactyl's ability to check or remove faster Pokemon which they may be dissuaded by, such as Iron Moth and Keldeo. Mega Aerodactyl's ability to force in defensive Pokemon can also lead to some interesting synergies with other offensive Pokemon, particularly when carrying Taunt; setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Enamorus and Bulk Up Buzzwole benefit from Mega Aerodactyl's ability to lure in and weaken walls such as Skarmory, Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

Earthquake nails several Ground-weak targets in Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Bisharp after a Dragon Dance, OHKOing the latter. Dual Wingbeat, especially with the boost from Tough Claws, flattens many neutral targets after a Dragon Dance, such as Clefable, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Mega Latias, while also allowing it to beat walls such as Buzzwole and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Mega Aerodactyl can run Roost in the last slot to offset its lack of longevity, potentially grabbing multiple setup opportunities against weaker Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Clefable lacking Thunder Wave. Due to its offensive prowess, this Mega Aerodactyl set fits best on fast-paced teams as an effective mid-to-late game cleaner. Early-game wallbreakers such as Enamorus can help Mega Aerodactyl by opening up gaps in the opposition through their numerous offensive applications against walls which the latter may find itself being stopped by, such as Slowbro, Scizor, and Iron Defense Skarmory. Conversely, Mega Aerodactyl’s tendency to find opportunities against specific targets such as Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur can also work to the benefit of other late-game cleaners, such as Booster Energy Iron Moth. As Mega Aerodactyl often finds itself leveraging its bulk to make the most of its setup capabilities, teammates that can prevent entry hazards from going up, such as Taunt Mew, Excadrill, and Tapu Fini, make for excellent partners.

Hurricane, in conjunction with Flyinium Z, gives Galarian Moltres a powerful one-time nuke in Supersonic Skystrike that can break through neutral targets such as Blissey and Gastrodon, threatening to outright OHKO the latter at +2 while also offsetting Hurricane’s middling accuracy in the process. As Galarian Moltres can struggle to safely find setup opportunities against faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Enamorus, it pairs best with offensive teammates that can also complement its wallbreaking prowess; late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Aegislash and Booster Energy Iron Moth capitalize on Galarian Moltres's ability to weaken specific answers, such as Unaware Clefable and Skeledirge, respectively, allowing them to sweep opposing teams with greater ease late-game. The latter can also invite in and weaken Rock-types such as Tyranitar, which Galarian Moltres can struggle to break through otherwise. Galarian Moltres's Stealth Rock weakness and inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots necessitates strong anti-hazard options, leads such as Excadrill and Mew can all shut down common entry hazard setters, the former via Rapid Spin and the latter via Taunt.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Although it tends to underperform defensively due to the presence of dangerous threats such as Aegislash as well as competition with other Spikers like Ting-Lu, Mew still has great bulk for the tier and can sport a good amount of utility for teams with entry hazard setting or removal. Mew can easily set Spikes against foes such as Ting-Lu and Skarmory, and it can even set the hazard against offensive threats such as Mega Latias and Rotom-W. Mew can also switch into and remove entry hazards against Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Clefable with Defog. Will-O-Wisp allows Mew to cripple wallbreakers such as Bisharp and Scizor. In a pinch, Will-O-Wisp can also be used to prevent faster threats like Zeraora and Iron Boulder from causing havoc. Knock Off has good synergy with Spikes to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from threats like Slowbro, Iron Moth, and Zeraora while still being able to punish Choice-locked wallbreakers such as Keldeo and Hydreigon. Psychic allows Mew to immediately pressure threats like Iron Moth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur, while Night Shade can provide consistent damage into threats such as Ting-Lu and Celesteela. Mew's EV spread is invested to outrun Adamant Choice Band Buzzwole, but it is flexible enough to run slower spreads like 16 Speed EVs to just outrun Bisharp. Mew best fits on balance teams looking to find a valuable role compression option that can set or control entry hazards while still blanket checking a ton of threats, such as Buzzwole and Iron Boulder, which helps to enable teammates such as Mienshao, Scizor, and Iron Moth. Common pivots such as Rotom-W and Victini can easily force Mew in and pivot out to checks such as Aegislash, so partners that can block or punish their pivoting such as Ting-Lu and Zeraora as well as Rocky Helmet users like Clefable and Rotom-W are appreciated. Mew hates offensive Dark-types like Lokix, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar even if it can punish them, so it enjoys additional partners like Mienshao and Keldeo to force them out. Aegislash is a big roadblock for Mew, so pairing it up with Iron Moth and Bisharp is great for it; in return, Mew can harass their common checks such as Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur. Spikes Mew can also pair nicely with Stealth Rock users like Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Hippowdon to overwhelm entry hazard removers such as Excadrill and Rotom-W. Partners that can take advantage of Rotom-W's attempts to use Defog, such as Bisharp, also are valuable to Mew in order to let it set Spikes freely.</p>"

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Mew is a good lead option for hyper offense teams as its better bulk compared to other leads allows it to set both Stealth Rock and Spikes and prevent opposing entry hazards and Defog attempts with Taunt. However, Mew suffers competition from lead Excadrill, which is capable of setting up Stealth Rock against Mega Sableye and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, something heavily appreciated by Stealth Rock weak Pokemon like Iron Moth. Taunt prevents Defog from slower targets like Rotom-W and Tapu Fini, setup attempts from Pokemon like Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Stealth Rock and Spikes from setters like Excadrill and Skarmory, respectively . Explosion allows Mew to generate momentum and hinder entry hazard removers like Hydreigon and Excadrill from removing entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin, respectively. Flare Blitz can be used to heavily dent Steel-types like Excadrill and Scizor, but it's a worse option overall, as it lacks consistency to KO itself with the recoil, unlike Explosion. Red Card works well to force out opposing lead Excadrill and setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Thundurus if Mew survives a hit. Lead Mew fits best on hyper offense teams where it can support its teammates by setting up entry hazards. Air Balloon Aegislash and Sinistcha are great partners capable of spinblocking Excadrill; they appreciate Mew's entry hazards weakening walls such as Celesteela or in Aegislash's case weakening fast revenge killers like Iron Moth and Mega Aerodactyl into Shadow Sneak KO range. Wallbreakers like Swords Dane Mega Gallade and Calm Mind Keldeo can easily set up against Dark-types that Mew lures in like Tyranitar and Hydreigon. Nasty Plot Thundurus is another great partner that can pressure Defoggers like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W to keep entry hazards up for the rest of team. Late-game cleaners like Autotomize Celesteela, Booster Energy Iron Moth, and Double Dance Galarian Moltres enjoy Mew preventing Steath Rock with Taunt and its Spikes potentially putting Tyranitar in Energy Ball and Supersonic Skystrike KO range, respectively. Finally, since Mew lacks the ability to get entry hazards up against Mega Sableye, good partners that can pressure it like Nasty Plot Thundurus and Galarian Moltres make for great options.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Azumarill excels as a strong setup sweeper on hyper offense teams thanks to the combination of Belly Drum and Huge Power allowing it to output colossal damage against walls such as Gastrodon, Slowbro, and Tangrowth while also being able to hold its own against offensive threats like Enamorus and Iron Moth with Aqua Jet. Its defensive value to hyper offense teams is also important, as it's a solid check to threats like Mienshao. Unfortunately, Azumarill's low Speed leaves it susceptible to common checks such as Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur, which all shrug off its +6 Aqua Jet. Play Rough is important in order to beat bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Tapu Fini and Hydrapple while also mauling Dragon-types that may otherwise check it such as Mega Latias. Knock Off is valuable to rip apart common Steel-types such as Aegislash and Skarmory after a Belly Drum boost, and the progress it forces against threats it can't immediately beat such as Volcanion and Amoonguss is very valuable. Alternatively, Liquidation can be used in order to OHKO Skarmory and bulky Scizor. Ice Spinner is a middle ground option that especially terrorizes Grass-types like physically defensive Tangrowth while still being able to annihilate Skarmory and Celesteela. Normalium Z provides a near guarantee that Azumarill can set up a Belly Drum and sweep, but Sitrus Berry is perfectly fine if it's partnering with another Z-Move user. The 4 HP EVs are important for Sitrus Berry sets, as they ensure the berry activates after setting up with Belly Drum, but it's better to run 4 Defense or Special Defense EVs instead on Normalium Z sets to minimize Stealth Rock damage. Since Azumarill tends to struggle even with +6 Aqua Jet against faster foes that resist Water like Keldeo and Zarude, partners that can threaten them, such as Thundurus and Hawlucha, respectively, are greatly appreciated. In return, Azumarill can break open defensive staples like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Hippowdon for them. Although Azumarill is a powerful sweeper, it can't break through physically defensive behemoths such as Quagsire and Mega Venusaur, so partners like Meteor Beam Celesteela and Alakazam are great to have while Azumarill takes cares of their checks like Ting-Lu for them. Hyper offense leads such as Excadrill and Mew are essential partners to help Azumarill break through foes like Skarmory with the help of entry hazard chip. Ribombee is another option that helps Azumarill negate its poor Speed with Sticky Web so it can deal with threats such as Mega Venusaur and Tapu Fini. Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus can wear down checks like Mega Venusaur and Rotom-W for Azumarill while it takes down threats such as Gastrodon for it. Cleaners such as Alakazam, Galarian Moltres, and Iron Moth appreciate Azumarill softening defensive checks such as Chansey, Ting-Lu, and Celesteela for them.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Azumarill finds a solid niche in the tier as a wallbreaker with access to priority in Aqua Jet and an excellent defensive typing that provides switch-in opportunities into common threats such as Choice Specs Keldeo. Its STAB combination threatens common metagame staples such as Ting-Lu, Mega Latias, Tyranitar, Buzzwole, and Hippowdon. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill threats like Sand Rush Excadrill, Booster Energy Iron Moth, and Iron Boulder. Knock Off hits Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Amoonguss, and item removal is valuable for helping chip down walls like Slowbro, Celesteela, and Skarmory into range for future assaults by Azumarill or its teammates. Choice Band Azumarill fits best on bulky offense teams, as they can reliably fit pivots such as Scizor and Rotom-W. Azumarill appreciates the pivoting support that these Pokemon provide in helping it enter the field, and in return, it pressures Pokemon that dissuade U-turn or Volt Switch such as Rocky Helmet Buzzwole, Hippowdon, and Ting-Lu. Azumarill's excellent defensive typing provides bulky offensive teams with the ability to withstand hits from otherwise threatening wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Choice-locked Greninja. Furthermore, its access to priority lets it revenge kill fast offensive threats that threaten these teams such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Booster Energy Iron Moth. Azumarill's biggest hindrance in the tier is Mega Venusaur; and,to a lesser extent, Amoonguss, which can withstand all of Azumarill's moves and threaten it with Sludge Bomb, Leech Seed, or status. Therefore, Azumarill should be paired with partners that can reliably dispatch or scare out Mega Venusaur such as Mega Latias and Air Slash Celesteela. While other defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth, Hydrapple, and Tapu Bulu need to watch out for Choice Band Azumarill's Play Rough, they can slow down its attempts at wallbreaking and retaliate with their Grass-type STAB moves or, in Tangrowth's case, Rocky Helmet. Pokemon that can punish these Grass-types like Iron Moth, Offensive Celesteela, Mega Latias, Victini, and Scizor thus make excellent partners for Azumarill. In a similar vein, blanket physical walls like Rocky Helmet Buzzwole and Skarmory can punish an Azumarill Choice-locked into one of its STAB moves; as a result, Azumarill appreciates the support of special attacking wallbreakers such as Thundurus, Alakazam, Volcanion, and Keldeo. In return, these special wallbreakers appreciate Azumarill's ability to handle special walls like Ting-Lu, Slowking, and Blissey. Volcanion and Keldeo in particular appreciate its ability to pressure Mega Latias. Additionally, Water-types like Slowbro, Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Volcanion have resistances or immunities that allow them to pivot in on Choice-locked Azumarill and threaten it with burns and Toxic. Consequently, Pokemon that exploit bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Zeraora, and Hydrapple make excellent teammates. Azumarill appreciates entry hazard support from the likes Excadrill, Skarmory, and Clefable, as they can help chip down answers such as Mega Venusaur.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With great special bulk, Regenerator, and Teleport, Slowking is an effective pivot and defensive check to prominent threats like Iron Moth, Enamorus, and Keldeo, being able to switch in against their powerful moves and either bring another teammate to maintain momentum or set up Future Sight and switch out right after. Scald allows Slowking to punish switch-ins like Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth. Future Sight synergizes well with Teleport by threatening Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur while aiding wallbreakers like Scizor, Thundurus, and Bisharp by giving a free entry with Teleport to better pressure the opposing walls in conjunction with Future Sight. The extra damage provided is useful even against neutral or resistant targets like Gastrodon and Celesteela. Thunder Wave cripples faster targets like Mega Latias, Hydreigon and Enamorus. Teleport is preferred over Chilly Reception due to its negative priority, but the latter can be useful to disrupt sand from Tyranitar and Hippowdon to prevent Excadrill from activating Sand Rush. A Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs is used to ensure Slowking is as slow as possible to possibly switch out after an opposing Teleport user like Slowbro. Heavy-Duty Boots blocks damage from entry hazards, notably allowing Slowking to better check Choice Specs Enamorus while maximizing recovery from Regenerator. Slowking fits best on balance and bulky offense teams where its defensive and support capabilities are appreciated by both defensive and offensive partners. Ground-types like Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Excadrill can block Volt Switch from Zeraora; in return, Slowking can check Water-types like Keldeo and Volcanion. Fighting-types are also amazing partners by pressuring Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon for Slowking while enjoying Future Sight discouraging common switch-ins like Mega Venusaur and Clefable. Tyranitar deserves a special mention, as it usually tries to switch in and Pursuit trap Slowking. Good partners to deal with Dark-types include Buzzwole and Mienshao. Choice Specs Enamorus can put heavy pressure on Slowking with repeated Moonblasts respectively, making secondary checks like Celesteela and Scizor useful to help with Enamorus while Slowking scouts dangerous moves like Mystical Fire for them. Finally, frail offensive Pokemon like Thundurus and Victini enjoy the free entry Slowking provides with Teleport or Chilly Reception. Nasty Plot Thundurus is especially notable by threatening most Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon with Focus Blast or All-Out Pummeling.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Accounting for its diverse movepool, priority options, and huge base Attack, Scizor makes for an incredibly threatening wallbreaker and cleaner on more offensive teams. Furthermore, Scizor's Steel typing and decent bulk also complements its ability to keep many faster threats in check, such as Enamorus, Mega Latias, and Alakazam, while using them as setup fodder. Knock Off allows Scizor to break past Slowbro and Skeledirge while also OHKOing Victini; it can even prove useful for removing items from several soft checks otherwise reliant on them, such as Leftovers from Rotom-W. Dual Wingbeat is usually preferred in the last slot for its coverage against specific physical walls able to blank its other attacks, such as Buzzwole, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth, but Close Combat can be used instead to deal more damage to Steel-types such as Skarmory, Magnezone, and Bisharp, putting immense pressure on the former at +2 while OHKOing the latter two unboosted. Quick Attack can also be used to give Scizor an extra priority attack, allowing it to finish off weakened foes that would otherwise resist Bullet Punch, such as Iron Moth and Zeraora, although its lack of coverage can leave Scizor to struggle with breaking through the aforementioned defensive targets. Due to its lack of longevity and early- or mid-game prowess, this Scizor set usually fits best on select offensive teams that appreciate its versatility in being able to deal with faster threats. Entry hazard support from the likes of Excadrill and Lead Mew can help push several Pokemon, such as Iron Moth, Tyranitar, and Tapu Fini, into Scizor's KO threshold. Scizor also appreciates specific teammates that can help weaken or take advantage of Fire- and Steel-types, like Iron Moth and Greninja, as it can often be dissuaded from sweeping by their presences in a vacuum while they remain healthy. Conversely, other late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Bisharp, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Dragon Dance Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Scizor's own ability to force damage onto shared checks such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Choice Scarf Keldeo while allowing Scizor to forgo its late-game approach if attacking early may be more optimal for enabling the rest of its teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>A fantastic defensive typing alongside powerful priority allow Scizor to be an important defensive piece as well a great late-game cleaner on most teams. Swords Dance is essential to allow Scizor to sweep weakened teams, and it pairs well with Bullet Punch, allowing Scizor to ignore its mediocre Speed and KO faster threats, like Alakazam and Iron Boulder. Knock Off allows Scizor to overwhelm checks such as Celesteela and Rotom-W that rely on Leftovers to check Scizor over a longer game. U-turn is another option that allows Scizor to pivot in threats such as Iron Moth and Greninja on typical Scizor checks such as Skarmory and Skeledirge. Roost is essential to allow Scizor to consistently perform defensive roles over a long game, as well as set up on weaker defensive foes, like Hippowdon and Tangrowth. Heavy-Duty Boots is typically preferred on Scizor to prevent it from being worn down too quickly by entry hazards, but Leftovers can also be used on teams with more reliable hazard removal. Buginium Z can be utilized alongside U-turn to defeat foes such as Amoonguss at +2 while also allowing Scizor to threaten foes such as Ting-Lu without being forced to switch out. 112 Attack EVs with an Adamant Nature allow Scizor to OHKO Mega Gardevoir with Bullet Punch, 12 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed Skeledirge, and 76 Special Defense EVs allow Scizor to survive 2 Shadow Ball from uninvested Aegislash. However, EVs can be moved from Attack to Defense or Special Defense to help Scizor better check threats such as Iron Boulder or Aegislash respectively, though 16 Attack with an Adamant nature is recommended to OHKO Mega Gardevoir after Stealth Rock. Bulky Swords Dance Scizor can be used on offensive and bulky teams that appreciate Scizor's priority and defensive profile. Teammates such as Mega Gardevoir and Alakazam appreciate Scizor removing Leftovers from shared checks such as Aegislash and Celesteela; Scizor's defensive profile provides support against threats such as Zeraora and Iron Boulder. Scizor often struggles to break through Skarmory, so teammates that can take advantage of it, like Aegislash, Iron Moth, and Magnezone are appreciated. Scizor is also heavily threatened by Fire-types like Iron Moth and Skeledirge, so partners such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Ting Lu that can handle these threats are mandatory; in return, Scizor can check common switch-ins to these defensive pieces such as Hydrapple and Mega Venusaur. Scizor can also struggle to threaten certain offensive Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, like Iron Moth and Greninja, so teammates such as Hippowdon and Celesteela that can handle these threats or wear them down until Scizor can pick them off later in the game are appreciated.</p>"

Knock Off allows Scizor to remove important items from Pokemon otherwise reliant on them to deter it, such as Leftovers from Rotom-W and Celesteela and Rocky Helmet from Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Pursuit takes advantage of Scizor's excellent typing against several Psychic-type Pokemon to trap them, most notably Mega Latias, Alakazam, and Slowking. Alternatively, Close Combat and Dual Wingbeat are options to pose a more immediate threat to their respective targets, such as Excadrill and Magnezone with Close Combat and Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur with Dual Wingbeat. Scizor fits best on bulky offense teams that can best take advantage of its strong momentum-grabbing capabilities and cleanup potential. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Iron Moth can help Scizor by threatening the physical walls used to stifle it, including Skarmory and Buzzwole; in return, Scizor can help force damage onto walls that normally handle these pivots, such as Tangrowth and Blissey. Scizor also appreciates strong entry hazard removal options to avoid being worn down quickly, including Defog from Rotom-W, Tapu Fini, and Volcanion and Rapid Spin from Excadrill; the aforementioned Defog users are also capable of taking advantage of Fire-types that may pose a threat to Scizor, such as Victini. On the other hand, entry hazard support from the likes of Clefable and Ting-Lu is imperative to increase the overall impact of Scizor's pivoting capabilities as well as extend its capacity to revenge kill threats like Galarian Moltres with Bullet Punch.</p>"

Close Combat OHKOes threats like Tyranitar while 2HKOing bulkier Pokemon like Skarmory. Rock Blast threatens Flying-types such as Enamorus, Galarian Moltres, and Thundurus, as well as Fire-types like Iron Moth that could otherwise take Close Combat and force Mega Heracross out. Pin Missile threatens Slowbro and Mega Venusaur, while Substitute lets Mega Heracross avoid Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye, capitalize from the forced switches it generates, and ease prediction against Pokemon it forces out.

Mega Heracross is prone to being revenge killed by faster threats like Alakazam, Iron Moth, and Enamorus, so teammates that can deal with them such as Tapu Fini, Tyranitar, and Celesteela, respectively, are appreciated.

However, its poor typing and mediocre Speed cause it to be easily chipped down throughout the course of a game and forced out on many occasions. In addition, there are switch-ins to Mega Heracross, such as Buzzwole, that limit the damage it can do each time it switches in, as well as competition in the form of Buzzwole that can outlast it and deal more damage over the course of a game. Despite these flaws, though, Mega Heracross carves out a solid niche for itself in the NDUU metagame thanks to its raw power. Rock Blast nails the few Pokemon that resist both of Mega Heracross's STAB moves like Enamorus, Iron Moth, and Blacephalon. The final slot is interchangeable: Earthquake allows Mega Heracross to hit Aegislash, which otherwise would wall this set, while Trailblaze lets Mega Heracross patch up its middling Speed, outspeeding the likes of Alakazam and Mega Latias at +1, at the cost of being completely walled by Aegislash. Mega Heracross fits on balance teams that appreciate its ability to force tons of damage onto any foe and ease late-game cleanup. Ting-Lu is a perfect partner for Mega Heracross, being able to both stack entry hazards to wear down checks like Aegislash as well as take on dangerous Psychic-types and special attackers like Alakazam, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon that all threaten Mega Heracross. Hazard removers such as Excadrill and Defog Rotom-W allow Mega Heracross to find switch in opportunities without fearing Spikes set by Ting-Lu or Skarmory, while both help Mega Heracross in additional ways: Excadrill serves as a temporary stopgap to Fairy-types like Choice Scarf Enamorus and Clefable and scares Aegislash, while Rotom-W provides pivot opportunities for Mega Heracross to come in and wreak havoc. Celesteela is another great partner, as it is a far sturdier Fairy resistance alongside chip damage in the form of Leech Seed or cleaning potential with Autotomize; it also deals with Buzzwole, a major hurdle for Mega Heracross.</p>"

Skarmory also serves as a valuable Spikes user thanks to it being able to set up against threats such as Buzzwole, Blissey, and non-Flamethrower Clefable. The combination of Iron Defense and Body Press is Skarmory’s preferred choice to make progress against teams, as it allows it to stonewall threats such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Tyranitar while also further pressuring threats such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Dropping Iron Defense and Body Press for Whirlwind or Toxic and Brave Bird respectively is also an option on more offensive teams to pressure threats such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur more effectively while also offering extra team support by phasing or spreading poison damage. However, this comes at the cost of being far more passive against Excadrill and lacks a proper response to Bisharp. 96 Speed EVs allows Skarmory to outspeed Adamant Azumarill. On stall teams, Skarmory has the choice of running Defog in place of either Spikes or Iron Defense and can also run an EV spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 Spe with an Impish nature to outspeed Choice Band Tyranitar, allowing it to boost or safely heal up before Tyranitar can 2HKO it. Skarmory’s main item of choice is Rocky Helmet to get residual damage off against foes with U-turn such as Scizor while also chipping setup sweepers, but it can also run Shed Shell on bulkier playstyles such as balance and stall in order to avoid being trapped by Magnezone. Skarmory can struggle a lot against special attackers such as Iron Moth and Enamorus, so specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Chansey, and specially defensive Skeledirge are good partners to shore up that weakness. Tyranitar is another good partner, since it can switch into and Pursuit trap threats that pressure Skarmory such as Iron Moth and Hisuian Zoroark. Common pivots that take advantage of Skarmory such as Thundurus also hate being Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar. Skarmory also has issues against Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Victini, so bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Alomomola can help deal with them. Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zeraora can also threaten Skarmory, so bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon are good partners to hinder them, but bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur also work as teammates at the cost of being unable to block Volt Switch. The aforementioned Ground-types can also form strong entry hazard stacking cores with Skarmory that bulkier playstyles such as stall enjoy greatly. Offensively, wallbreakers such as Life Orb Mienshao make for good partners, since they appreciate Skarmory's Spikes helping them chip their checks so they can wallbreak easier.</p>"

Its absurdly powerful Knock Off and Pursuit combined with its excellent special bulk also make it a premier Pursuit trapper capable of dominating common Psychic-types such as Victini and Slowking as well as physically frail foes like Iron Moth and Blissey. Superpower targets Ting-Lu and Excadrill. While an Adamant nature maximises Tyranitar's wallbreaking power, a Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed Bisharp and Aegislash with a Speed-boosting nature. Tyranitar best fits on offense teams looking for a wallbreaker and Pursuit trapper. It is especially effective at removing special walls such as Blissey, making specially attacking teammates such as Enamorus and Iron Moth great partners. Pivots, notably specially attacking ones such as Slowbro and the aforementioned Iron Moth, can force in special walls and safely bring in Tyranitar. Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Skarmory enjoy Tyranitar's ability to break through most hazard removal options, and it greatly appreciates the chip damage they provide in return. Tyranitar is dominated by Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Buzzwole, making checks to them such as Clefable and Mega Latias mandatory teammates. Sand Stream can notably support Sand Rush variants of Excadrill, and because they are both physical wallbreakers, Tyranitar and Excadrill can weaken their shared physically defensive checks like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. While Tyranitar matches up well against many special attackers, it falters against a good deal of them such as Alakazam and Thundurus due to its weaknesses, making specially defensive tanks such as Slowking and Assault Vest Tangrowth useful partners.</p>"

      "Utility Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With access to formidable utility options alongside its considerable bulk and resistances, Tyranitar makes for a great supporting presence able to check various threats such as Iron Moth, Aegislash, and Victini all while not being particularly passive. Additionally, Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability passively chips Pokemon such as Rotom-W while also limiting recovery from Mega Venusaur's Synthesis and Iron Moth's Morning Sun. Due to the sheer number of switches it forces offensively as well as its ability to threaten common hazard removers such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Rapid Spin Dhelmise, Tyranitar is a great user of Stealth Rock. Knock Off ensures Tyranitar can force progress against walls such as Ting-Lu, Celesteela, and Tangrowth by removing their item, diminishing much of their defensive capability. Besides threatening to trap frailer Pokemon such as Slowking, Iron Moth, and Blacephalon, Pursuit also allows Tyranitar to deal with other types of targets that cannot afford to trade with it, such as a Choice-locked attacker like Iron Boulder. Stone Edge provides Tyranitar with a way of hitting the various Dark-resistant Pokemon in the tier, dealing solid damage to Clefable, Buzzwole, and Tapu Fini. Leftovers is typically the item of choice to provide Tyranitar with passive recovery that helps it heal from entry hazards damage as well as check threats like Iron Moth that it may be tasked with handling long-term. However, Chople Berry can be used instead to allow Tyranitar to take certain Fighting-type attacks that would otherwise KO it, most importantly Aegislash's Close Combat into Shadow Sneak as well as Alakazam's Focus Blast at full HP. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to be as threatening as possible offensively, outrunning other offensive Pokemon such as Azumarill and Aegislash lacking a Speed-boosting nature. Alternatively, if outrunning these Pokemon isn't a concern, Tyranitar can run an EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Atk / 136 SpD / 76 Spe instead; this notably allows it to survive a Focus Blast from Thundurus after Stealth Rock while still outspeeding uninvested Skarmory. Tyranitar fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to trap its given pool of dangerous offensive and defensive threats alike, preventing its teammates from being overwhelmed by them in the long run. Other defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Celesteela, and Skarmory greatly appreciate Tyranitar's ability to outright deter certain attackers such as Iron Moth and Swords Dance Aegislash; in return, they provide an additional measure of security against Pokemon that Tyranitar cannot take on consistently, such as Mega Latias and Mega Aerodactyl, which often pack coverage to deal with it. Skarmory also packs Spikes to supplement Tyranitar's numerous forms of residual damage. Although Tyranitar threatens them, the likes of Pecharunt and Victini also have the means to chip it down with Malignant Chain and U-turn, respectively, preventing Tyranitar from doing its job reliably; Defensive pivots such as Scizor, Slowbro, and Rotom-W can help it get onto the field more efficiently. Rotom-W can also remove debilitating entry hazards with Defog to further improve upon Tyranitar's longevity. On the other hand, certain offensive Pokemon such as Enamorus, Hydrapple, and Latias appreciate Tyranitar's ability to threaten common defensive roadblocks such as Slowking and Celesteela, thus paving the way for them to break more effectively. Furthermore, these Pokemon also take advantage of Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Buzzwole that would otherwise threaten Tyranitar. Notably, Excadrill makes for a great partner, providing it with Rapid Spin support to preserve Stealth Rock while appreciating Sand Stream's ability to enable Sand Rush, turning it into a terrifying offensive threat now capable of outrunning Choice Scarf users such as Enamorus as well as +1 Iron Moth and Iron Boulder.</p>"

Its typing allows it to check important threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Victini, and Excadrill, and utility options like Toxic and Yawn are useful to pressure Defoggers or force switches, respectively. Flip Turn allows Swampert to function as a slow pivot and bring another teammate in safely against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Slowbro. Toxic cripples Defoggers like Rotom-W and Salamence and walls like Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Gastrodon. Yawn is an alternative that can discourage setup sweepers like Calm Mind Latias or Clefable from taking advantage of Swampert, and it synergizes well with Flip Turn and entry hazards by forcing the opposing Pokemon to switch out and surrender momentum. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs is used to ensure Swampert is as slow as possible, letting it use Flip Turn after the opposing Pokemon attacks. Swampert fits best on offensive teams looking for a pivot that can set up Stealth Rock and safely bring in frail wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Enamorus against walls like Slowbro. Pivots like Victini and Thundurus can create VoltTurn cores and enjoy Swampert bringing them in against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela. Celesteela in particular appreciates Swampert's Electric immunity and ability to check Victini, Rotom-W, and Zeraora; in return, Celesteela deals with Grass-types that annoy Swampert like Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Tapu Bulu. Slow wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Choice Band Bisharp can pressure Pokemon that Swampert invites in like Slowbro, Salamence, and Clefable. The latter two are especially notable since they can Pursuit trap Slowbro, and all of them enjoy Swampert's ability to keep entry hazards up and maximize their wallbreaking potential. Finally, Swampert is very reliant on Leftovers to check threats like Excadrill as it lacks other forms of recovery, making Knock Off absorbers like Mega Venusaur and Z-Move Hydreigon great partners.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice and an incredible Special Attack stat, Mega Gardevoir is one of the tier's most effective stallbreakers, able to threaten many defensive staples like Ting-Lu with its STAB moves and rip through neutral and even resistant targets like Clefable and Skarmory. However, Mega Gardevoir faces competition from Enamorus as a wallbreaker and other Fairy-types with more defensive utility like Tapu Fini. Psyshock allows Mega Gardevoir to do decent damage to Blissey and also threatens Pokemon that resist Hyper Voice, like Mega Venusaur. Mystical Fire hits the Steel-types that resist both of its STAB moves, such as Celesteela and Aegislash. These three moves make Mega Gardevoir a potent threat on its own, so the fourth slot can be changed to whatever suits the team best. Teleport takes advantage of the many switches Mega Gardevoir forces thanks to its high power, letting it pivot out of checks like Celesteela and Chansey and bring out Pokemon like Magnezone that can trap the former, and Pokemon like Choice Band Bisharp and Choice Band Tyranitar that can Pursuit trap both. Taunt prevents status and recovery moves from Pokemon like Chansey. Calm Mind is another great option against defensive teams, as it takes advantage of these slower structures by boosting up its Special Attack. This allows it to break through foes that would normally stop it, notably being able to 2HKO the likes of Chansey and Celesteela after a boost. Mega Gardevoir commonly finds itself on offensive teams that appreciate a strong wallbreaker, such as teams with VoltTurn cores, as these teams may struggle to properly break stall and bulkier teams. However, Mega Gardevoir can struggle against specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Celesteela, and Jirachi. Chansey is able to poison Mega Gardevoir lacking Taunt, and defensive Celesteela and Jirachi can both take a hit and retaliate with Heavy Slam and Iron Head, respectively. Mega Gardevoir greatly appreciates help from strong physical attackers like Mienshao and Victini and good entry hazard setters, such as Ting-Lu, Swampert, and Excadrill, to pressure these Pokemon. Pokemon like Thundurus that can pressure its aforementioned checks with special attacks are also great teammates. Mega Gardevoir's Speed also leaves it susceptible to being picked off by Choice Scarf Mienshao, Iron Moth, Mega Aerodactyl, and Excadrill in sand, making Skarmory and Rotom-W great defensive partners. In return, Mega Gardevoir can threaten the bulky cores that these Pokemon may struggle to break apart.</p>"

Earthquake and Toxic allow Flygon to properly perform its role by checking the aforementioned options as well as ensuring that Flygon can beat certain entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu. However, Flygon can fail to prevent hazards being set up by Clefable and Skarmory given its inability to threaten them. While Defog is essential for Flygon to perform its primary role, alternative utility options such as U-turn, Dragon Tail, and Psychic Noise are options on bulkier hazard-stacking teams that appreciate Flygon's defensive profile but do not need Defog. Leftovers is generally preferred on Flygon, as its Spikes immunity and Stealth Rock resistance mean that Heavy-Duty Boots is not necessary. Groundium Z is an alternative option to allow Flygon to threaten OHKOs on certain Ground-weak foes like Aegislash and Iron Boulder that may otherwise be able to survive an Earthquake. The given EV spread avoids a 3HKO from Choice Band Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave, lets Flygon take Shadow Ball twice from maximum Special Attack Aegislash and not be 4HKOed by Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, and outspeeds Timid Magnezone and positive-natured Aegislash. When using Groundium Z, an alternative EV spread of 16 Attack and 148 Special Defense with an Adamant Nature is recommended to always OHKO maximum HP Shield forme Aegislash and always take Shadow Ball twice from maximum Special Attack Aegislash. Given Flygon's inability to handle many of the metagame's premier threats such as Alakazam, Mega Venusaur, and Excadrill and inability to use Defog on common hazard setters like Skarmory and Clefable, heavy team support is necessary to facilitate it, leaving Flygon generally only used on stall or other bulky team styles. Reliable answers to Clefable and Skarmory such as Jirachi, Mega Venusaur, and Aegislash are required alongside Flygon; in return, Flygon can check Fire- and Ground-types such as Victini and Ting-Lu. Mega Venusaur, in particular, is a common partner for Flygon, as it appreciates Flygon's ability to remove hazards, can check both Clefable and Skarmory, and appreciates Flygon absorbing burn from Rotom-W. While Flygon provides great utility, its middling bulk means it can often struggle to handle common threats Ground-types like Hippowdon and Ting-Lu are tasked with handling, such as Choice Band Tyranitar and Choice Band Iron Boulder. For this reason, partners like Skarmory and Tangrowth are important alongside Flygon to help handle such threats and patch up holes Flygon may leave in these bulky teams' defensive structures.</p>"

This defensive prowess allows it to reliably answer threats such as Iron Moth, Buzzwole, and Keldeo, while the likes of Magic Guard Clefable and Ting-Lu struggle to break through it after it has boosted with Calm Mind. Psyshock provides Mega Latias with a strong STAB move that targets specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Assault Vest Primarina, and Slowking on their weaker Defense stat while ignoring the boosts of opposing Calm Mind sweepers such as Reuniclus, Clefable, and Keldeo. Recover allows Mega Latias to leverage its huge bulk and consistently check the likes of Iron Moth and Thundurus by providing reliable recovery. Lastly, Aura Sphere provides Mega Latias with critical coverage against common Pokemon such as Excadrill and Hydreigon while preventing Tyranitar and Bisharp from being able to Pursuit trap it reliably. However, on teams that can reliably deal with Tyranitar, Mystical Fire is an option that allows Mega Latias to completely flip the script against Scizor while ensuring Mega Latias isn't walled by Celesteela and Aegislash, though it should be noted that Mega Latias will require significant chip damage to break past the last two. Given its lack of immediate damage output against bulkier Pokemon and methodical playstyle, Calm Mind Mega Latias is best suited to balance and entry hazard stacking teams that emphasize longevity. Entry hazard setters such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Gastrodon are pivotal to Mega Latias's ability to sweep through weakened teams, chipping down various Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, Mega Gallade, and Iron Boulder to where it can comfortably finish them off; in return, Mega Latias provides them with a solid natural check to offensive threats such as Iron Moth and Thundurus that may threaten them early in the match. Additionally, Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Scizor can assist Mega Latias by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Slowking, Hydrapple, and Victini and Leftovers from Celesteela and Hippowdon. Without Mystical Fire, Mega Latias also struggles to break past certain Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Scizor, and Celesteela, making dedicated answers such as Rotom-W, Iron Moth, and Skeledirge as well as early-game wallbreakers that can help pressure them such as Life Orb Mienshao and Choice Specs Greninja important teammates. Lastly, Mega Latias is very weak to all forms of status; the likes of Zeraora, Mega Venusaur, and Hippowdon threaten to poison it, cutting into its longevity significantly, whereas paralysis from Slowking and Clefable cripples it similarly. This makes status absorbers such as Amoonguss and cleric support from Blissey and Chansey highly valuable to ensure Mega Latias isn't stopped by these Pokemon.</p>"

Aura Sphere is preferred as a coverage option to ensure Mega Latias can hit Steel- and Dark-types such as Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Bisharp consistently while avoiding Pursuit trapping attempts from the last two. Alternatively, Mystical Fire trades its ability to hit the aforementioned Dark-types for additional coverage against Aegislash and Celesteela; it also notably OHKOes Scizor from full. Draco Meteor provides Mega Latias with a stronger STAB option, threatening massive damage to traditional checks such as Slowbro and Victini on top of OHKOing Hydrapple and opposing maximum HP Mega Latias after Stealth Rock. However, Calm Mind can be used to boost Mega Latias's natural power, allowing it to tear through defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini after a boost. Entry hazard setters such as Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Mold Breaker Excadrill are solid choices to help weaken certain Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar to where Mega Latias can KO them. Offensive Mega Latias is also more vulnerable to revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Zygarde-10%, meaning checks such as Scizor, Zeraora, and Lokix pair extremely well with it; these Pokemon also benefit from Mega Latias's ability to threaten physically defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole while being able to overwhelm walls such as Blissey and Celesteela in return. When running Aura Sphere, Magnezone is also a notable teammate, as its Magnet Pull ability can immediately dispatch Scizor and Celesteela, ensuring Mega Latias doesn't have to deal with them. Lastly, while Mega Latias can still afford to switch into Mienshao and Iron Moth in a vacuum, its lack of bulk investment means it is more vulnerable to being overwhelmed by them, making pivoting teammates such as Scizor, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Rotom-W valuable to ensure it can hit the field safely and force them out.</p>"

Though, if that role has already been covered on the team, Jirachi can also run Fire Punch to hit common checks like Scizor and Aegislash, or Body Slam to paralyze foes like Hippowdon and Celesteela. U-turn allows Jirachi to maintain momentum and bring its teammates in safely. Healing Wish can fully heal whichever one of Jirachi’s worn down teammates is needed the most late-game. Alternatively, the combination of Wish and Protect can be used to vastly increase the Jirachi’s longevity, though it diminishes its support capabilities and renders it more passive. 16 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed Adamant Bisharp. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Jirachi’s special bulk. Jirachi is prone to getting Pursuit trapped by Dark-type Pokemon like Tyranitar and Bisharp and thus needs to be positioned carefully to not be taken out too early. It also pairs well with Pokemon that can switch into these threats such as Keldeo. Jirachi is also weak to common Ground-types like Excadrill and Hippowdon and thus pairs well with Pokemon like Celesteela or Rotom-W that can handle them.

Spikes and Stealth Rock take advantage of Gastrodon's ability to threaten Excadrill and Rotom-W, two of the most common forms of hazard control. Clear Smog deters any setup from sweepers immune to status like Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Fini. Toxic prevents Pokemon such as Hydrapple, Hydreigon, and Mega Latias, which can take Gastrdon's STAB moves, from freely taking advantage of it. Scald's ability to spread burn gives it a chance to punish any attempt at setup or entry from Pokemon such as Azumarill, Scizor, and Mega Venusaur; with the alternatives of Earthquake and Earth Power having the ability to immediately threaten Iron Moth and Aegislash. Said options can also break potential Substitutes from Pokemon such as Aegislash, Keldeo, and Mega Gardevoir, which Scald cannot do. Recover allows Gastrodon to be a more consistent answer to U-turn Iron Moth and Tyranitar compared to Ting-lu, which otherwise has greater bulk, the ability to phaze setup sweepers, and the ability to punish defensive Pokemon with Ruination. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage that may disrupt Gastrodon's ability to safely take attacks. Leftovers ensures that Gastrodon does not have to recover every bit of damage it takes when attempting to pivot in on weaker moves, making it a useful alternative on teams with reliable entry hazard removal. Maximum HP and Defense EVs give Gastrodon the physical bulk to take on threats like Iron Boulder, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Band Tyranitar. An EV spread of 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD can be used instead to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse, with the drawback of being less secure against the aforementioned threats. Gastrodon fits well onto balance and hazard-stacking teams, with its ability to check threats such as Victini, Iron Boulder, and Keldeo and stop Volt Switch momentum from Rotom-W and Zeraora. Specially defensive Pokemon like Slowking, Blissey, and Amoonguss work well with Gastrodon, answering Pokemon that threaten it like Choice Specs Greninja, Serperior, and Alakazam. Celesteela in particular is a good partner, covering Gastrodon's weakness to Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Hydrapple while benefiting from Gastrodon's Electric immunity and resistance to Fire-type moves in return. Stealth Rock users like Clefable and Skarmory enjoy Gastrodon's ability to stack Spikes. Gastrodon's inability to check Energy Ball Iron Moth means it appreciates Booster Iron Moth checks like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Latias, which in turn enjoy the entry hazards set by Gastrodon. Win conditions and wallbreakers like Swords Dance Aegislash, Calm Mind Reuniclus and Keldeo, and Stallbreaker Enamorus relish in Gastrodon's profile of resistances, ability to lure in and potentially punish Grass-type Pokemon with status, and its tendency to be able to set entry hazards multiple times a game.</p>"

Spikes or Stealth Rock allow Gastrodon to support its teammates by wearing down the opposing team. If the team already has entry hazards covered, Clear Smog can be used to stop common setup sweepers such as Victini and Clefable that would otherwise greatly threaten Gastrodon and its teammates. Scald is used to cripple both physical attackers and poison-immune Pokemon with a burn. Earthquake is an alternative for more immediate pressure against Poison- and Steel-types such as Okidogi and Iron Moth, but it leaves Gastrodon unable to punish switch-ins like Celesteela and Skarmory. The final moveslot is usually given to Toxic, which allows Gastrodon to slowly wear down its answers. Alternatively, Protect can be used in tandem with Leftovers to improve its longevity while also scouting common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Keldeo and Enamorus. Gastrodon's great special bulk and unique resistances allow it to help out Pokemon like Skarmory, Slowbro, and Tangrowth that struggle against strong Fire- or Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Volcanion, Sandy Shocks, and Zeraora. Gastrodon can get worn down quickly through poison and burn and therefore appreciates cleric support from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey. Its low Defense also leaves it susceptible to strong physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, and therefore, it appreciates physical walls such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole that can handle those threats.

Earthquake serves as Hippowdon's way to threaten the foes it switches into, while Toxic is often used to pressure common switch-ins, like Rotom-W and Salamence. Leftovers is generally preferred to ensure Hippowdon can sponge both physical and special attacks better, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used on teams lacking entry hazard removal. 8 Attack EVs allow Hippowdon to guarantee the OHKO on Excadrill. Specially defensive Hippowdon is only seen as a sand setter on balance sand teams, which appreciate its longevity and ability to pressure defoggers like Rotom-W and Salamence.

Hidden Power Fire guarantees the OHKO on Scizor and deals heavy damage to Excadrill switching in. Hidden Power Grass hits the few Pokemon able to withstand Magnezone's STAB combination in Gastrodon and Swampert. Toxic wears down the aforementioned Ground-types while being a more effective way to pressure Ting-Lu long-term. A Timid nature allows Magnezone to outspeed Adamant Bisharp and Mega Venusaur, but Modest can be used for extra power, notably 2HKOing specially defensive Hippowdon with Flash Cannon if the ability to outspeed said Pokemon is not needed. Choice Specs Magnezone fits best on bulky offense teams and works extremely well with Pokemon able to lure in Steel-types for it. Mienshao, U-turn Scizor, and Lokix can bring Magnezone in safely against Skarmory; Scizor in particular becomes a deadly late-game sweeper with Swords Dance and can threaten out a lot of Magnezone's revenge killers in Mienshao, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Gallade with Bullet Punch. Mega Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Venusaur love Celesteela being removed; in return, these Pokemon can pressure Ting-Lu, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss. Offensive Mega Venusaur can easily beat Ground-types trying to block Magnezone's Volt Switch like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Ting-Lu and usually forces Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela in for Magnezone to trap them. Defensive pivots like Slowbro, Slowking, and Rotom-W are good partners to handle Fighting- and Fire-types that threaten Magnezone, such as Mienshao, Iron Moth, and Victini; they can also help against Ground-types like Excadrill and Hippowdon and bring Magnezone in safely against Pokemon such as Clefable and Tapu Fini.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass targets Gastrodon, Quagsire, and some rare foes like Swampert. Electrium Z powering up Thunderbolt helps Magnezone break through certain foes it traps such as Scizor and specially defensive Celesteela; Steelium Z primarily helps against Ground- and Grass-types such as Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur. Magenzone best fits on offense teams looking to remove certain Steel-types, namely Skarmory and Celesteela. This enables numerous teammates such as Scizor. Since it fears taking Skarmory's Body Press and Celesteela's Flamethrower upon switching in, a pivot that can lure them in like Mienshao or Scizor is a great partner. A Stealth Rock setter like Clefable can let Magnezone avoid Sturdy to OHKO Skarmory. Magnezone is completely helpless against Excadrill, so Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth and Slowbro can help by dealing with them. After removing opposing Steel-types, Magnezone isn't particularly useful, though it's still a reasonably strong special wallbreaker, especially if it still can use its Z-Move. It struggles with special walls like Blissey and Chansey, so physical wallbreakers, notably Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, can help by removing them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Tangrowth's excellent natural physical bulk, crucial resistances, and variety of utility options at its disposal come together to make it a solid physical wall, being an effective stop to the likes of Tyranitar and Excadrill. Regenerator only serves to further complement the aforementioned defensive traits, blessing it with the longevity needed to repeatedly switch into and answer these Pokemon. Knock Off allows Tangrowth to cripple incoming switch-ins by removing important held items, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Thundurus and Leftovers from Clefable and Celesteela, making them far easier to wear down in the long-term. Hidden Power Fire allows Tangrowth to deal high amounts of damage to Steel and Grass-type Pokemon in a pinch, most notably 2HKOing Scizor. Alternatively, Focus Blast greatly improves Tangrowth's matchup against Excadrill and Bisharp, being able to OHKO the latter, although its lack of accuracy can be somewhat irritating. Sleep Powder allows Tangrowth to neutralize incoming targets it would otherwise be unable to threaten, such as Iron Moth, offensive Celesteela, and Skarmory while also shutting down setup sweepers like Calm Mind Clefable and Enamorus. However, Toxic can be used instead to permanently cripple Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Mega Latias, and Slowking, limiting their ability to pivot into Tangrowth throughout the game. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to punish contact moves from the likes of U-turn, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to provide Tangrowth with greater longevity against entry hazards, allowing it to take advantage of Regenerator more effectively; it also helps keep Tangrowth out of KO range of wallbreakers it may try to switch in against, such as Iron Boulder and Excadrill when entry hazards have been set. Tangrowth fits best on balance teams that appreciate its longevity and diversity in crippling opposing teams via its utility options. Entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Toxic Spikes Iron Moth appreciate Tangrowth's ability to deter opposing hazard removal options such as Tapu Fini and Rotom-W while further capitalizing on Tangrowth's tendency to remove various items from targets, such as Thundurus and Amoonguss, with Knock Off. Specially defensive teammates such as Slowking, Gastrodon, and Celesteela have excellent defensive synergies with Tangrowth, compensating for its low Special Defense by providing a solid backbone against threats such as Hydreigon and Alakazam; Slowking and Gastrodon also help Tangrowth play around with the likes of Keldeo, utility Clefable, and Victini, which can overwhelm it easily. In return, Tangrowth can help check the likes of Bisharp, which may threaten them. Besides the aforementioned Pokemon, offensive teammates such as Victini, Choice Specs Enamorus, and Thundurus appreciate Tangrowth's ability to sponge Knock Off from Pokemon that they may be forced out by, such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Scizor.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Tangrowth is a solid special wall that can check threats like Enamorus, Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Alakazam thanks to Assault Vest and Regenerator, allowing it to pivot against these threats reliably throughout the game. Tangrowth's great movepool also allows it to punish specific targets to help its team; for example, Knock Off can remove Leftovers from Celesteela, making wallbreakers like Alakazam much more threatening and Heavy-Duty Boots from Iron Moth and Zeraora. Power Whip is used to beat Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Keldeo, but Giga Drain is a fine alternative that can provide reliable recovery. Focus Blast threatens Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Excadrill trying to use Tangrowth as setup fodder, while Sludge Bomb is used to fish for poison against targets like Mega Latias and hit Enamorus super effectively. Hidden Power Fire is Tangrowth's best way to hit Scizor and can be useful to chip targets like Skarmory and Excadrill into Focus Blast range. Finally, Earthquake hits Excadrill, Aegislash, and most importantly Iron Moth super effectively. Assault Vest is the item of choice so Tangrowth can offset its terrible Special Defense and check special attackers more reliably. Tangrowth fits best on balance teams as a good pivot capable of checking special attackers like Keldeo and scouting coverage moves like Mystical Fire from Pokemon like Enamorus for teammates like Slowking and Aegislash. Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Skarmory are all great teammates that enjoy Tangrowth checking Water-types like Keldeo and removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Victini and Enamorus to make their entry hazards much more effective. In return, Hippowdon and Skarmory can deal with threatening wallbreakers like Swords Dance Excadrill and Bisharp. Powerful special attackers like Choice Specs Enamorus and Nasty Plot Hydreigon can pressure Tangrowth with their STAB moves or super effective coverage, making additional defensive answers like Celesteela and Ting-Lu good options. Bulky Water-types like Slowking are good partners that can check threats like Iron Moth, Victini, and Volcanion for it; in return, Tangrowth can check Rotom-W. Clefable can scout Knock Off from opposing Clefable, opposing Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini, preventing Tangrowth from losing its much needed item. Finally, Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Iron Moth and Victini, while enjoying Tangrowth removing Leftovers from Defoggers like Rotom-W and Tapu Fini.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its astronomical Attack stat further bolstered by Swords Dance, Mega Gallade is nigh-unmatched as a wallbreaker in National Dex UU, shredding through defensive cores consisting of common Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Mega Venusaur, Buzzwole, and Celesteela with ease. Mega Gallade's Speed tier is also excellent, outpacing notable offensive threats such as Mienshao, Hydreigon, and Keldeo. Close Combat's immense power allows Mega Gallade to achieve several outstanding feats; it comfortably 2HKOes Celesteela and Gastrodon, and at +2, it can OHKO rather bulky targets such as Rotom-W and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Zen Headbutt serves as Mega Gallade's strongest STAB option against Clefable, 2HKOing it at +2 while threatening common Fighting-resistant targets such as Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Knock Off complements Mega Gallade's STAB combination perfectly by hitting many Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon super effectively, OHKOing Slowking and Aegislash at +2 while also greatly threatening Slowbro, Victini, and Skeledirge. Alternatively, Triple Axel exchanges said coverage for the ability to OHKO Hydrapple unboosted and other targets such as Mega Latias and physically defensive Hippowdon at +2. Justified allows Mega Gallade to take advantage of weak Dark-type attacks such as Knock Off from Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth prior to Mega Evolving. Mega Gallade fits best on bulky offense teams, which can efficiently facilitate its opportunities to wallbreak. Defensive pivots such as Rotom-W, Scizor, and Slowking are vital for their ability to generate momentum, allowing Mega Gallade to hit the field safely against the likes of Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur, and stifle potential revenge killing attempts from faster threats such as Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Conversely, other offensive Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Heavy-Duty Boots Thundurus possess excellent offensive synergy with Mega Gallade, pressuring physically defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Hippowdon that it may have trouble breaking through. In return, Mega Gallade can take advantage of their ability to use U-turn to switch into specially defensive walls such as Tyranitar and Blissey. Lastly, Mega Gallade greatly appreciates support from entry hazards, which can help wear down the likes of Skarmory and Tapu Fini to the point where it can KO them. Good examples of hazard setters that pair well with Mega Gallade include Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Mold Breaker Excadrill.</p>"

Defensively, Rotom-W doubles as a momentum-maintaining check to offensive threats such as Excadrill and Mega Aerodactyl for more offensively oriented teams. Rotom-W can utilize Defog effectively thanks to a good matchup into the aforementioned Ground-types, as well as Skarmory, the premier Spikes setter in the tier. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to cripple common physical attackers such as Swords Dance Aegislash, additionally wearing down Mega Venusaur. Toxic threatens some of the few Pokemon that do not fear Rotom-W's STAB moves, such as Tangrowth, Mega Latias, and Gastrodon. Lastly, Pain Split allows Rotom-W to maintain longevity, especially helping it stick around versus fatter teams utilizing Chansey or Blissey and further chip down Mega Venusaur. The given EV spread allows Rotom-W to outrun max Speed Tyranitar and get ahead of most offensive Aegislash variants. Given its nature as a pivot, teammates like Tyranitar, Alakazam, and Bisharp that can capitalize on foes Rotom-W often forces in, such as Chansey, Mega Latias, Mega Venusaur, and Clefable work incredibly well. Ground-types that do not fear Hydro Pump, such as Gastrodon and Swampert, give Rotom-W trouble; Mega Venusaur is a great teammate to threaten these foes for it while Rotom-W can often bring it in on Clefable and Hydrapple.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With a threatening STAB combination alongside a great defensive profile, Rotom-W is an excellent option for teams looking for speed control that provides a blend of power and utility and can repeatedly threaten foes like Excadrill and Iron Moth lacking Booster Energy throughout a game. Trick allows Rotom-W to cripple otherwise great counters like Gastrodon and Amoonguss, and while this leaves it unable to provide speed control, it also prevents foes like Ting-Lu and Tapu Fini from taking advantage of it being locked into Volt Switch or Hydro Pump, respectively. Defog is useful, as it grants Rotom-W even more utility, especially for offensive teams that find it hard to fit entry hazard control, and it lets it deal with common hazard setters in Ting-Lu and Skarmory. On teams with other forms of hazard control, Will-O-Wisp can be utilized to check bulkier physical attackers, such as Swords Dance Aegislash. 236 Speed EVs ensure Choice Scarf Rotom-W outspeeds Mega Aerodactyl while 32 Special Attack EVs allow it to OHKO Excadrill with Hydro Pump; the rest being invested in HP. Rotom-W is utilized most effectively on offensive teams that appreciate its power and utility, but it can also be used on bulkier teams if given proper team support. Teammates like Mienshao and Hydreigon appreciate the pivot support Rotom-W provides, bringing them in on foes like Blissey and Hydrapple, while forming a pivoting core that can bring it in on their checks, like Slowbro and Tapu Fini. Rotom-W is stifled by Grass-types, especially Mega Venusaur, as Rotom-W cannot use Trick to cripple it with Choice Scarf, so checks to them like Celesteela and Scizor are appreciated. In return, Rotom-W can check Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Victini for its partners. Choice Scarf Rotom-W also suffers from a lack of longevity, as it must invest heavily in Speed and cannot utilize Pain Split or Leftovers; therefore, it appreciates faster team compositions with teammates like Enamorus, Excadrill, and Tyranitar that aim to win quickly, which allows Rotom-W to leverage its defensive profile efficiently short-term to grant it and its teammates more attacking opportunities. On bulkier team structures alongside defensive options like Celesteela and Ting-Lu, Rotom-W appreciates Wish support from partners like Clefable and Chansey to allow it to stay healthy throughout the game, given its lack of recovery.</p>"

Nasty Plot also allows Rotom-W to potentially beat setup variants of Clefable and Roost Scizor one-on-one, outboosting them before they can deal significant damage back. Hydro Vortex not only allows Rotom-W to immediately OHKO threats such as Iron Moth and Iron Boulder that would otherwise survive Hydro Pump at full HP, but it can also break past weakened Amoonguss and Mega Latias at +4 and Blissey at +6, respectively. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to support its team in scenarios where it is unable to wallbreak effectively, facilitating frail offensive threats such as Life Orb Mienshao and Iron Boulder with safe entry. Lastly, Pain Split keeps Rotom-W healthy by sapping HP from defensive targets such as Celesteela and Blissey, making it easier to shrug off potential aliments such as Leech Seed and Toxic from them while trying to set up with Nasty Plot. 56 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar, while the rest are put into HP and Defense to maximize its ability to handle physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Swords Dance Aegislash when combined with a Bold nature. However, additional Speed EVs can be considered to ensure Rotom-W outpaces specific threats such as Swords Dance Scizor and Bisharp at the cost of some physical bulk. Nasty Plot Rotom-W fits best on hazard-stacking bulky offense and balance teams, which are best suited to helping it overwhelm potential checks such as Mega Venusaur and Mega Latias with sheer offensive pressure or residual damage, respectively. Hazard setters such as Gastrodon, Clefable, and Skarmory are critical for their ability to set Stealth Rock and Spikes, which can wear down and deplete the recovery options of some of the aforementioned checks; Gastrodon and Skarmory can also lure Hydrapple and cripple it with Toxic, which otherwise doesn't mind taking hazard chip damage thanks to Regenerator and otherwise completely counters Rotom-W, whereas Clefable can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Blissey with Knock Off. Conversely, dedicated wallbreakers such as Life Orb Mienshao, mixed Aegislash, and Mega Gardevoir are highly effective as partners for their ability to force progress against Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Calm Mind Clefable, and Slowking, paving the way for Rotom-W to break past them later; in return, Rotom-W can assist these Pokemon by providing a safety net against potential revenge killers such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Scizor. On either archetype, paralysis support from Serperior, Thunder Wave Clefable, and Prankster Thundurus is appreciated for luring in and crippling Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Serperior, and Alakazam early in the match, as losing the ability to outspeed Rotom-W dilutes their ability to answer it after a boost.</p>"

Toxic is used in the last moveslot to give Victini a way of applying long-term pressure against certain physically defensive pivots such as Hippowdon and Rotom-W that otherwise don't mind taking V-create, allowing Victini to outlast them in the long run. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp deals less residual damage against the aforementioned targets but it allows Victini to deter physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Azumarill from switching in while creating mind games against Pursuit Tyranitar. Encore is also an interesting option that allows Victini to continue breaking down Pokemon such as Clefable and Mega Latias that rely on stalling V-create via recovery moves while letting Victini double as an effective countermeasure against their setup variants. This Victini set typically fits best on bulkier team structures, which can provide it with sufficient opportunities to break down the opposing team as well as provide a solid defensive foundation for it to fall back on against potential adversaries such as Mega Aerodactyl and Keldeo. Additionally, these structures also appreciate Victini's ability to help play around dangerous threats such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Clefable, and Skarmory are prime examples that can also support Victini through their use of status moves or, in Clefable's case, Knock Off to remove opposing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Skeledirge. Similarly, other defensive pivots such as Rotom-W, Scizor, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Celesteela can assist Victini by sponging attacks from the likes of faster Pokemon that may force Victini out, such as Iron Boulder and Shadow Ball Alakazam. Lastly, additional pivoting support, particularly from the aforementioned Rotom-W and Scizor as well as Zeraora and Choice Scarf Mienshao can form effective VoltTurn cores with Victini, utilizing their ability to help force out the likes of Iron Boulder and Mega Aerodactyl in order to compensate for Victini’s lower Speed tier. These Pokemon also appreciate Victini's own ability to lure in and wear down several of the walls that may deter them from making progress, such as Hippowdon, Mega Latias, and Pecharunt.</p>"

Its Speed tier is also fantastic, allowing it to outspeed and force out Pokemon like Mienshao and Keldeo for offensive playstyles. Substitute capitalizes on forced switches against Rotom-W, Slowbro, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon that can't afford to take a Leaf Storm while easing prediction. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel- and Grass-types like Celesteela, Scizor, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. Leftovers allows Serperior to set up Substitute more often, while 56 HP EVs are used to prevent Rotom-W's Hydro Pump from breaking its Substitute. Serperior fits best on offensive teams filled with Pokemon that appreciate a potential late-game cleaner and enjoy its paralysis support overwhelming threats like Mega Latias. Iron Moth can lure in Ground- and Water-types like Ting-Lu and Slowking for Serperior and enjoys the paralysis support it provides against shared checks like Mega Latias or fast revenge killers like Iron Boulder and Mega Aerodactyl. Similarly, partners like Life Orb Mienshao, Mega Gardevoir, and Enamorus, which may struggle against faster checks like Mega Latias, Iron Moth, and Mega Aerodactyl, appreciate Serperior's ability to paralyze said threats, allowing them to threaten them out with Triple Axel and Psyshock. Even with Leaf Storm and Hidden Power Fire, Serperior still struggles to get past a large number of top-tier Pokemon, like Mega Venusaur, Iron Moth, and Celesteela, and can also be revenged killed by Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Greninja.

Synthesis allows Serperior to switch into Rotom-W and Ting-Lu throughout longer games without being worn down, taking advantage of these opportunities to chip away at its checks. Glare eases the matchups against Aegislash and Celesteela by allowing Serperior to paralyze them and attempt to remove them from higher health thresholds alongside paralysis. Normalium Z Serperior is only seen on Sticky Web and other offense teams, as its aggressive playstyle and lackluster bulk leave it unable to attempt to set up multiple times against teams with revenge killers like Iron Boulder and Mega Aerodactyl. Sticky Web slows down the former, but answers to Mega Aerodactyl like Air Balloon Aegislash, Azumarill, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Mienshao are recommended given its ability to dodge the entry hazard. The last two can also pivot Serperior in against physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W that Serperior can force out; notably, this allows Serperior to avoid chip damage from Body Press and Volt Switch and ensure Serperior is not afflicted with status.

Rapid Spin supports the team while also making sure that Excadrill can beat other Sand Rush Excadrill and Unburden Hawlucha. If a teammate can remove entry hazards, Rock Slide is an alternative that stops Celesteela and Skarmory from stonewalling Excadrill, as well as handling threats such as Thundurus. Leftovers is an alternative option that provides Excadrill with passive recovery, allowing it to keep hazards off more reliably.

Iron Head provides Excadrill crucial coverage against Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Enamorus and 2HKOes Clefable, allowing Excadrill to better deal with it. Toxic allows Excadrill to cripple a multitude of bulky Pokemon that would otherwise check it, from Slowbro and Hydrapple to Ting-Lu and Hippowdon, notably allowing Excadrill to keep Stealth Rock off the field against the last two more reliably. Additionally, Excadrill can also use Stealth Rock to further support its teammates, most notably being a hazard setter that can consistently threaten Rotom-W, one of the most common hazard removal options in the tier. It's worth noting on teams that necessitate the ability to set Stealth Rock, Toxic can be used over Iron Head to ensure Excadrill retains its ability to threaten several of the aforementioned defensive Pokemon. Lastly, Swords Dance is an option that helps Excadrill break past defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Slowking, enabling it to sweep teams late-game in conjunction with Rapid Spin's Speed boost. The first EV spread allows Excadrill to survive a Close Combat from Jolly Zeraora, outspeed Aegislash and Magnezone that run a Speed-boosting nature, and OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-W and 2HKO most variants of defensive Scizor after Stealth Rock with Earthquake, with the rest put into Special Defense to maximize its ability to take hits from special attackers such as Mega Venusaur. On sets using Swords Dance, Excadrill should instead run maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature to be as offensively threatening as possible. Pokemon that benefit the most from Excadrill's utility options include offensive threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Gardevoir, and Iron Boulder, which appreciate not being worn down by entry hazards as well as Excadrill's ability to cripple or take advantage of certain defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Slowking, and Scizor for them. In return, these teammates can assist Excadrill in overwhelming Celesteela and Skarmory that otherwise completely blank it and help manage faster attackers such as Alakazam and Iron Moth. Similarly, other defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Hydrapple, and Mega Latias benefit from Excadrill's hazard removal and ability to assist against threats such as Aegislash; lessening the first two’s reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots to manage hazards is also a major boon. In return, these Pokemon can help deal with Fighting- and Ground-types such as Mienshao, Ting-Lu, and Gastrodon and absorb Knock Off from Mega Venusaur and Zeraora that would otherwise cut into Excadrill's survivability. Lastly, certain Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Celesteela deserve a special mention; their role compression can help free Excadrill from the need to run Stealth Rock or check Pokemon such as Clefable with Iron Head, allowing it to be much more flexible in its moveslots and role compression.</p>"

Rapid Spin prevents opposing entry hazards from being set. Steel Beam allows Excadrill to go out while generating momentum for its teammates, as well as preventing common Defoggers such as Tapu Fini from clearing its Stealth Rock. Toxic is another option to cripple opposing hazard setters and Mega Sableye long-term. Focus Sash is an important item to ensure that Excadrill can reliably set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can struggle against threats such as Skarmory and Celesteela due to their Ground immunities; strong setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus, Meteor Beam Celesteela, and Swords Dance Iron Boulder can pressure them for it. Excadrill's Rapid Spin is especially beneficial for setup sweepers otherwise vulnerable to Stealth Rock, such as Booster Energy Iron Moth and Galarian Moltres.</p>"

Additionally, Krookodile's access to Intimidate alongside its decent physical bulk can also help it deal with or play around other physical attackers such as Excadrill, Victini, and Tyranitar. However, Krookodile faces heavy competition in this role, being difficult to justify over other Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Mega Aerodactyl, and Bisharp as well as other Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao and Enamorus, which provide more offensive flexibility and better defensive utility options on most teams. The aforementioned Pursuit users also have a much easier time eliminating said targets due to their higher Attack stats, requiring less chip damage. Knock Off allows Krookodile to cripple incoming defensive Pokemon by removing their item, notably removing Leftovers from Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Celesteela and Heavy-Duty Boots from Scizor and Amoonguss and assisting its teammates in breaking past them. Earthquake is Krookodile's strongest Ground-type STAB option, being able to OHKO Excadrill as well as Victini and offensive Aegislash after slight chip damage; it also allows Krookodile to apply decent pressure to defensive Pokemon such as Scizor and Amoonguss after it has removed their item with Knock Off. Toxic allows Krookodile to punish incoming defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Hydrapple, and Hippowdon that otherwise don't mind taking a Knock Off. Alternatively, if Krookodile's team necessitates it, Stealth Rock enables Krookodile to set entry hazards for its team to help gradually wear down defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur. Choice Scarf Krookodile is used on select bulky offense and balance teams that require its ability to outspeed and trap important threats such as Swords Dance Aegislash and Iron Boulder, relieving its teammates of having to deal with them throughout the match. Special attackers such as Keldeo, Enamorus, and Iron Moth benefit the most from Krookodile's ability to deter revenge killing attempts from these Pokemon and remove dedicated checks such as Slowking, making them far more offensively threatening as a result. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Clefable, Skarmory, and Blissey is crucial to help force chip damage to where Krookodile can comfortably KO the aforementioned offensive Pokemon, allowing it to trap them much more effectively. Additionally, they can also help Krookodile defensively check Pokemon such as Mienshao, Hydrapple, and Mega Venusaur that typically force it out. Lastly, pivoting teammates such as the aforementioned Blissey as well as Scizor and Rotom-W are similarly important in assisting Krookodile with finding opportunities to get onto the battlefield and trap its desired targets; Blissey and Scizor can use Teleport and U-turn, respectively, on Aegislash, whereas Rotom-W can use Volt Switch on Slowking and Mega Latias, ensuring Krookodile doesn't have to take risk being crippled or taken out by their coverage moves in the process.</p>"

It also targets Steel-types like Excadrill. Fightinium Z serves the dual purpose of letting Hisuian Zoroark avoid having to rely on Focus Blast's terrible accuracy while giving it the power to OHKO foes like Hydreigon unboosted and Galarian Moltres at +2. Grass Knot hits Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, OHKOing most of them after Nasty Plot. Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offense teams with other wallbreakers and sweepers. Teammates like Iron Moth can KO or weaken Hisuian Zoroark's checks like specially defensive Celesteela, while it can remove foes like Hippowdon. Despite its good Speed, Hisuian Zoroark is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster foes like Choice Scarf Mienshao and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, making walls such as Skarmory for the former and Tapu Fini for the latter useful partners. Illusion makes Hisuian Zoroak pair nicely with Pokemon weak to Fighting and Ghost, such as Tyranitar and Victini, forcing the opponent into an uneasy guessing game that can allow it or its teammates to set up. Pretending to be a physical attacker can also lure in physical walls like Skarmory and Buzzwole.

Psyshock is an important STAB move used to break opposing Calm Mind users such as Clefable while still letting Reuniclus directly pressure threats such as Mega Venusaur. Focus Blast is a powerful coverage option that allows Reuniclus to break traditional Psychic-type switch-ins such as Ting-Lu and bulky Excadrill while also being able to lure foes such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Thunder is another option that allows Reuniclus to immediately threaten the likes of Slowbro and Celesteela, although it becomes harder to deal with Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Ting-Lu without Focus Blast. Alternatively, Reuniclus can use Stored Power and Acid Armor to become an unbreakable sweeper that threatens to dish out absurd damage as it accrues stat boosts. However, this variant is heavily prone to being shut down by Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Galarian Moltres. Phazers and stat removers such as Whirlwind Ting-Lu and Clear Smog Gastrodon also threaten to halt its progress. Z-crystals, such as Fightinium Z and Electrium Z, are valuable to nuke threats such as Ting-Lu and Slowking, respectively, without having to rely on the mediocre accuracy of Focus Blast and Thunder. Leftovers is another item option, since it gives Reuniclus great longevity when combined with Magic Guard. Colbur Berry is also useful when used with Focus Blast in order to lure Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp while also letting Reuniclus safely switch out once if it gets caught by their Pursuit. The given EV spread lets Reuniclus outrun Gastrodon in order to hit it hard with a boosted Psyshock before it can use Clear Smog. Reuniclus is heavily pressured by Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Tyranitar, so Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Mienshao are essential, and in return Reuniclus can remove walls such as Slowbro and Buzzwole. Ghost-type switch-ins such as Chansey and Ting-Lu pair nicely with Reuniclus to handle the likes of Aegislash and the rare Blacephalon, while Reuniclus can deal with Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Okidogi for them. Stat removers such as Clear Smog Gastrodon and phazers like Whirlwind Hippowdon can give Reuniclus issues, so partners like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can help deal with them while Reuniclus can pressure threats such as Skarmory in return. Strong pivots such as Scizor and Mienshao can also pressure Reuniclus, so speed control options such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W are solid partners to support it. Supporting walls such as Gastrodon and Slowbro are also useful partners to check them.</p>"

Psychic Noise is a strong option in order to force the hand of foes like Hippowdon and Slowbro by denying their recovery while still effectively pressuring threats such as Iron Moth. Psyshock is an alternative to better deal damage to Blissey. Knock Off is a good move to force progress against would-be checks such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Celesteela. Future Sight is an alternative to disrupt the opposing team's momentum by railroading them into a Future Sight switch-in such as Ting-Lu or Celesteela. Focus Blast is important to deal with Tyranitar and Bisharp on the switch while annoying checks like Ting-Lu. Shadow Ball is another option in order to pressure most variants of Aegislash and Mega Gardevoir, which threaten to use Reuniclus as setup fodder. The EV spread is somewhat flexible, as the Special Attack investment can be adjusted to benchmark for threats such as Iron Moth and Slowbro, but 16 Special Attack EVs is a nice starting number, letting Reuniclus 2HKO threats such as Aegislash after Stealth Rock. Regenerator is the ability of choice instead of Magic Guard in order to heal off damage as Reuniclus constantly switches in and out of special attackers. Assault Vest is prone to being worn down quickly by entry hazards and status, so Mega Sableye and a cleric like Chansey or Clefable can give Reuniclus the support it needs to stay healthy in order to check foes that threaten its partners, such as Iron Moth. Knock Off absorbers such as Quagsire, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory are also beneficial, as Reuniclus performs worse in its role as a blanket special wall without its Assault Vest. In return, Reuniclus can stop threats such as Mega Gardevoir and Volcanion for them. Strong physical attackers such as Excadrill and Scizor can be a nuisance for Reuniclus, so partners such as Tangrowth and Skarmory can deal with them while Reuniclus deals with Alakazam and Iron Moth for them in return.</p>"

Despite investing mainly in Special Defense, Amoonguss can still help teams play around certain physical attackers like Buzzwole, Mienshao, Choice Band Iron Boulder, Zeraora, and Scizor. Sludge Bomb hits targets like Enamorus and Clefable harder with the ability to cripple Mega Latias and Mega Gallade as they switch in, but Clear Smog can be used to ease matchups against Calm Mind sweepers like Clefable, Keldeo, and Tapu Fini. Foul Play hits Scizor and Aegislash hard, OHKOing the former at +2 after slight chip damage and the latter at +4 when in Shield Forme or at +2 when in Sword Forme. Spore allows Amoonguss to threaten Celesteela and Skarmory, which would otherwise completely wall it, and significantly improves Amoonguss's threat level if they need to be preserved in a matchup. Stomping Tantrum is only run alongside both Assault Vest and 56 Attack EVs with a Sassy Nature, which allows Amoonguss to OHKO Iron Moth, complemented by the fact that Assault Vest allows Amoonguss to better take attacks like Iron Moth's Fiery Dance, Keldeo's Supersonic Skystrike, and Hydrapple's Devastating Drake. However, Heavy-Duty Boots are preferred to allow Amoonguss to repeatedly switch into threats like Enamorus, Aegislash, and Rotom-W without being worn down by entry hazards. The given EV spread allows Amoonguss to survive +2 Shadow Claw from Aegislash and Triple Axel from Choice Scarf Mienshao after Stealth Rock, as Amoonguss is liable to having its Heavy-Duty Boots removed by Knock Off. Specially defensive Amoonguss is typically seen on balance and bulky teams looking for a reliable option to help deal with special attackers that can also reliably absorb status or Knock Off for teammates like Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon. While Amoonguss can deal with many special threats, its reliance on Regenerator for healing leaves it liable to being overwhelmed by strong special attackers like Hydrapple and repeated hits from Hydreigon and Aegislash. Teammates such as Celesteela, Blissey, and Scizor can pair together with Amoonguss to handle these attackers more reliably in shorter games while also handling threats like Alakazam and Mega Latias that Amoonguss cannot. In return, Amoonguss can scout the movesets of these options and soak up residual damage long-term, allowing these partners to stay healthy and exert pressure on the opposing team more reliably. While Amoonguss can often scout the movesets of physical threats like Mienshao and Swords Dance Aegislash, reliable counters to these Pokemon such as Buzzwole are recommended to ensure that a team can deal with these Pokemon long-term. Amoonguss also appreciates partners that can set hazards, such as Hippowdon, Clefable, Skarmory, and Blissey, as they ensure that it can wear down the attackers it's tasked with handling while it remains healthy itself.</p>"

Knock Off removes Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Clefable and Skarmory, which assists Mienshao in wearing them down long-term while also ensuring Fighting-immune and resistant Pokemon like Aegislash and Iron Moth are unable to switch in freely. U-turn can wear down switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur and Hippowdon until they are in 2HKO range of Close Combat, and also allows Mienshao to remain healthy by constantly triggering Regenerator. Fake Out is a fantastic option against offensive teams, allowing Mienshao to rack up chip damage against faster threats like Iron Moth and Zeraora, but Poison Jab is an option to help Mienshao break through Clefable immediately after Leftovers is removed. Mienshao typically finds itself on balance teams that appreciate its longevity with Regenerator as well as on offensive teams that appreciate Mienshao's ability to remove physical walls like Skarmory and Clefable for teammates such as Iron Boulder and Scizor. Given Life Orb Mienshao's subpar speed, teammates such as Zeraora and Mega Aerodactyl are appreciated for their natural Speed and ability to outrun threats such as Alakazam and Iron Moth. Mienshao also enjoys using U-turn to create momentum, so strong wallbreakers such as Aegislash and Iron Moth are appreciated, with the latter being able to bring Mienshao in on Ting-Lu in return. Other pivots such as Rotom-W and Victini can help Mienshao come in multiple times per match, allowing it to better break holes in the opposing team's defensive core.

Poison Jab is an option to help Mienshao against Enamorus and Mega Gardevoir, while Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Iron Moth. Triple Axel threatens Amoonguss, but it can be difficult to lock into given the prevalence of Rocky Helmet on defensive options like Skarmory. U-turn allows Mienshao to generate momentum against walls it cannot break, such as Skarmory and Hippowdon. Choice Scarf Mienshao can be utilized on teams that enjoy its longevity, resilience to entry hazards, and ability to outspeed other common speed control options like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Since Choice Scarf Mienshao can be stopped fairly easily due to its lack of power, hazard support is mandatory alongside it, often provided by Skarmory and Hippowdon; in return, Mienshao can check powerful offensive threats such as Greninja and Alakazam. Choice Scarf Mienshao also forces many switches, so wallbreakers such as Aegislash and Choice Specs Enamorus that can threaten common defensive responses to Mienshao like Skarmory and Clefable are important. While Mienshao is able to outspeed most offensive threats, Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Sand Rush Excadrill able to outspeed it.

Earth Power is specifically used to revenge kill Booster Energy Iron Moth and weakened Excadrill. Fire Blast allows Hydreigon to revenge kill Excadrill and hit targets like Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth hard.

Hydreigon is easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Alakazam and Keldeo, making additional defensive partners that can respond to these Pokemon, such as Gastrodon, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Slowking extremely valuable, letting Hydreigon maximize its wallbreaking efforts despite the presence of these Pokemon. Additionally, pivoting support from the likes of Iron Moth, Scizor, and the aforementioned Slowking can aid Hydreigon in finding safe entry against many of its defensive targets, preventing it from being worn down or threatened by potential coverage options and status that would otherwise be aimed at it, such as Close Combat from Aegislash or Thunder Wave from Rotom-W.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hydreigon is a potent wallbreaker, being able to threaten common special walls such as Celesteela with its powerful STAB moves and coverage options. It also has more longevity and defensive utility, including a resistance to Pursuit, at the cost of Speed and more consistent STAB moves compared to other special wallbreakers like Iron Moth. Draco Meteor OHKOes threats like Iron Moth and Mega Heracross while doing significant damage to foes such as Galarian Moltres and Mega Sableye. Dark Pulse threatens Slowking and gives Hydreigon a spammable STAB move. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types like Enamorus, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable. Fire Blast threatens Celesteela, Tangrowth, and Bisharp, Roost takes advantage of forced switches and lets Hydreigon stay healthy to switch in several times throughout the match, while U-turn lets it pivot out of foes it can struggle against such as Tapu Fini, Azumarill, and Clefable. A Timid nature lets Hydreigon outspeed Excadrill, while Modest gives Hydreigon even more power. Hydreigon struggles to break through Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini, Azumarill, and Clefable, as well as Celesteela if not running Fire Blast, so teammates that can pressure them like Thundurus and Mega Venusaur are helpful. Hydreigon also appreciates pivots such as Victini and Slowking that can safely get it onto the field; Victini can use U-turn to pivot out of switch-ins that Hydreigon threatens like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur, while Slowking can safely pivot it in with Teleport. Knock Off support from the likes of Mega Vensaur, Clefable, and Thundurus is appreciated to help Hydreigon break through Pokemon like Celesteela, Tapu Fini, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Setup sweepers like Tapu Fini and Galarian Moltres benefit from Hydreigon's longevity and ability to pressure their checks such as Mega Venusaur and Tyranitar, respectively, allowing them to become wincons late-game; fast teammates such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Keldeo also appreciate Hydreigon for this reason, with it being able to pressure their switch-ins such as Slowking and Assault Vest Tangrowth, which can open the way for them to clean late-game. Hydreigon can also easily be revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Hawlucha, Alakazam, and Enamorus; Skarmory can deal with Hawlucha while providing Spikes support, and Celesteela can deal with Alakazam and Enamorus.</p>"

Knock Off allows Thundurus to cripple Ting-Lu, Clefable, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Focus Blast allows Thundurus to deal heavy damage to Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon, also letting it serve as a decent offensive check to the first under sand. However, Grass Knot and Psychic are powerful coverage options that can 2HKO Gastrodon and Hippowdon and most variants of Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. U-turn allows Thundurus to maintain momentum but can be exchanged for Volt Switch to maintain damage against Rotom-W and Slowbro at the cost of needing to predict around Ground-types. Alternatively, Thunder Wave in conjunction with Prankster allows Thundurus to act as an emergency check to boosted threats such as Autotomize Celesteela or cripple a faster threat such as Mega Aerodactyl or Iron Boulder, making it easier for its teammates to pick them off. Thundurus fits best on offense teams that can compensate for its frailty and are best suited to its aggressive playstyle. Other offensive pivots such as Victini and Life Orb Mienshao tend to lure in physically defensive targets such as Slowbro and Buzzwole, providing Thundurus with a safe entry point; in return, they can threaten common specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Assault Vest Tangrowth that are typically used to check Thundurus. Thundurus is very vulnerable to Knock Off, which Pokemon such as Clefable and Scizor can potentially use to cripple it. Thus, teammates that can safely absorb these hits such as Ting-Lu and Slowbro are valuable partners that can also serve to check faster threats like Zeraora, Iron Boulder, and Mega Aerodactyl. Lastly, certain defensive pivots such as Clefable and Tyranitar can support Thundurus with hazards, which makes it much more effective at wearing down other checks such as Ting-Lu and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Keldeo leverages its fantastic offensive and defensive typing to be a reliable wallbreaker, capable of threatening defensive staples like Ting-Lu, Celesteela, Scizor, and Tyranitar while taking little from their attacks. Hydro Pump is generally preferred on Keldeo, OHKOing Buzzwole and Scizor after Stealth Rock and having odds to 2HKO defensive Celesteela. Surf hits similarly hard, and while it misses these damage thresholds, it provides greater consistency and more PP; this is particularly notable against Celesteela, which can waste Hydro Pump PP with Protect. Air Slash 2HKOes Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, while Flip Turn is an option alongside Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Bisharp, as they can threaten the aforementioned defensive options as well as other answers to Keldeo like Slowking and Mega Latias. Toxic is an alternative on teams without Pursuit to cripple checks like Slowking and Mega Latias, but it significantly hinders Keldeo's matchup against Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, making it a niche option. Vacuum Wave provides Keldeo with powerful priority that is able to pick off faster threats like Sand Rush Excadrill as well as weakened targets like Iron Boulder and Mega Aerodactyl. Keldeo is typically seen on offense and sand teams looking for a powerful special attacker that can shore up weaknesses to offensive threats like Mienshao and Iron Boulder. Sand teams in particular utilize Keldeo well, as Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Slowking and Mega Latias with Pursuit and provides sand, preventing Tapu Fini and Synthesis Mega Venusaur from being reliable long-term checks to Keldeo. Keldeo in return can help force damage onto Rotom-W and handle physical walls like Skarmory and Buzzwole. While Keldeo is powerful, it can struggle against teams with multiple Pokemon resistant or immune to its STAB attacks, which include defensive options such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Fini, Slowking, and Mega Latias. It can also be outsped quite easily by the offensive metagame, which consists of Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Iron Boulder, and Mega Aerodactyl. For these reasons, teammates like Scizor and Mienshao are appreciated for their ability to pressure shared checks, use Knock Off to remove important held items like Leftovers from Aegislash and Celesteela, and provide offensive answers to these Pokemon that threaten Keldeo. Teammates like Iron Moth and Zeraora work similarly, pivoting Keldeo in against Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon that it can threaten. Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Celesteela help provide Keldeo's team with a defensive backbone against options like Iron Boulder and Clefable, with the former two able to set entry hazards to wear down many of its checks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Keldeo is a fantastic wallbreaker, its formidable offensive typing and ability to run a variety of mixed attacking sets enable it to be a threat against balanced or stall teams, making it an effective setup sweeper versus the likes of Ting-Lu, Tyranitar, and Celesteela. Scald is an excellent Water-type STAB move for Keldeo, as it can burn foes and make it easier to wear down physical attackers like Scizor and Mega Gallade. Hydro Pump, though having lower accuracy, is best used in tandem with Waterium Z to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Calm Mind boost while threatening a KO on both Buzzwole and Scizor with an unboosted Hydro Vortex. Secret Sword is Keldeo's preferred Fighting-type STAB attack, as it hits common pivots to special attacks like Blissey. Substitute, when paired with Leftovers, helps Keldeo set up on defensive switch-ins like Slowking, Gastrodon, and Celesteela. Alternatively, Air Slash could be used for coverage against threatening Grass-type foes and gives Keldeo the ability to run Flyinium Z to OHKO the likes of Hydrapple and Mega Venusaur after a boost. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to prevent bulky Pokemon like Slowbro and Aegislash from spreading status. With this much wallbreaking power, Keldeo is seen on more offensive teams that are lacking in checks against the likes of Scizor and Greninja. Although Keldeo can be seen as a wallbreaking threat, many teams can utilize Pokemon that aren't weak to either STAB attack such as Mega Venusaur, Slowking, and Tapu Fini. There are also quite a few Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Keldeo such as Zeraora, Iron Boulder, and Serperior. Teamates such as Scizor and Mienshao help against these faster threats and can assist greatly by pressuring checks to Keldeo like Aegislash and Celesteela by removing their Leftovers while also being able to efficiently pivot out with U-turn. In return, Keldeo assists both by pressuring physical walls like Skarmory and Mandibuzz. Teammates that can provide entry hazard support such as Tyranitar and Clefable are appreciated by Keldeo, as chip from entry hazards makes it easier to threaten a OHKO on physical walls. Faster teammates such as Iron Moth and Zeraora can be excellent in baiting in Ground-type threats and pivoting back into Keldeo for more offensive pressure. In return, Keldeo removes Ground-type threats like Excadrill and Hippowdon to make it easier for both to pivot reliably.</p>"

Brave Bird deals great damage to Grass- and Fighting-type foes such as Mega Venusaur, Hydrapple, Serperior, and Buzzwole. Alternatively, Flare Blitz can deal with Pokemon such as Skarmory and Scizor. Talonflame can spread burn with Will-O-Wisp to the physical attackers that pivot into it such as Iron Boulder and Tyranitar, allowing it to status foes more reliably than Flame Body. U-turn is an excellent pivoting move, but it often comes at the expense of losing Defog or Will-O-Wisp. With 240 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature, Talonflame outspeeds Iron Boulder. Talonflame finds itself best utilized on balanced teams, being able to freely switch into foes and not only spread status but also remove hazards and quickly pivot out. Bulky hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon make for excellent teammates that Talonflame can switch in to after baiting in an Electric-type threat, but they can also assist versus other threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Alternatively, Blissey can be a great special sponge that can set hazards for Talonflame and is able to switch into Thundurus and Volcanion; in return, Talonflame checks the likes of Mienshao and Buzzwole for Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Blissey. Serperior complements Talonflame well by making use of strong Grass-type attacks to remove the likes of Rotom-W and Gastrodon and spreading status. In return, Talonflame can make use of those threats being gone to clear hazards or status Pokemon like Celesteela and Aegislash that would annoy Serperior. Slowking assists Talonflame by being an excellent pivot against Water-types such as Keldeo and Rotom-W. Mienshao, with its Fighting-type, not only is an excellent pivot teammate, but it's also one of the best options to help Talonflame deal with the likes of Tyranitar and Hydreigon.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Aegislash's valuable defensive profile and immense natural bulk in Shield forme make it perfectly capable of forcing out and setting up on passive Pokemon such as Slowking, Jirachi, and Amoonguss. Substitute allows Aegislash to take advantage of the aforementioned Pokemon's inability to deal sufficient damage to it while also protecting it from potential status moves from these Pokemon; it also allows it to safely land Toxic on incoming defensive walls such as Ting-Lu and Gastrodon, stalling them out in conjunction with King's Shield and recovery from Leftovers. Shadow Ball serves as Aegislash's main STAB move, and alongside Aegislash's naturally high Special Attack stat, is useful for putting pressure onto Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Excadrill, and Mega Sableye. The given EV spread allows Aegislash to 2HKO offensive Excadrill with Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery, outspeed uninvested Scizor, and avoid the 2HKO from Enamorus's Earth Power and Mega Gardevoir's Mystical Fire after Stealth Rock. SubToxic Aegislash fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to safely set up on and wear down defensive Pokemon while also making use of its ability to simultaneously check offensive threats such as Mega Latias. Due to Aegislash's fear of status moves, like Scald burns from the likes of Slowking, as well as Spore from Amoonguss, pivots such as Flip Turn Keldeo, U-turn Iron Moth, and Teleport Blissey are helpful to ensure that Aegislash finds safe opportunities against them. Other defensive Pokemon such as Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Clefable can form notable cores with Aegislash; the former two take advantage of Dark- and Ground-types such as Tyranitar and Ting-Lu, while Clefable provides additional support in staving off the likes of Buzzwole, which can potentially nail Aegislash on the switch with Earthquake. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable and Assault Vest Tangrowth are also helpful, as they can remove items from checks to Aegislash like Leftovers from Celesteela and Heavy-Duty Boots from Iron Moth and Scizor, giving it an easier time breaking through them in the long-run.</p>"

      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance turns Aegislash into a potent wallbreaker and sweeper, using its fantastic neutral coverage and bulk in Shield forme to set up against and break through defensive cores. Close Combat is Aegislash's strongest move overall, and it threatens the many Dark-types that would otherwise resist its Ghost-type STAB moves, like Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Ting-Lu. Iron Head is an alternative option that still OHKOes the former two after a boost while also 2HKOing Unaware Clefable. Shadow Sneak is a crucial priority move which at +2 can finish off weakened offensive Pokemon that would normally outspeed and take it out, such as Iron Moth and Keldeo, while also being usable to pick off Alakazam without a boost. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Aegislash's power, while a Jolly nature can be used instead to get the jump on Pokemon such as Adamant Tyranitar and Bisharp as well as slower variants of Rotom-W. However, this results in Aegislash missing out on certain damage thresholds, such as being unable to OHKO Mega Venusaur at +2 with the combination of Shadow Claw into Shadow Sneak. Ghostium Z is usually preferred to power up STAB Shadow Claw, which, when turned into Never Ending Nightmare, threatens to KO physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Amoonguss after Swords Dance. However, Air Balloon can be run instead if the team already has a different Z-Move user, and this also allows Aegislash to find free setup opportunities against Ground-types such as Excadrill and Hippowdon, potentially spinblocking the former. Aegislash fits best on more offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and ability to break open holes for its teammates early-game. Aegislash also suffers from having terrible bulk in Blade forme, so it is easily revenge killed after attacking, making entry hazard support from the likes of Mew, Ting-Lu, and Tyranitar helpful at chipping down offensive threats like Excadrill into Shadow Sneak range while also pressuring other walls such as Tapu Fini.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Aegislash's excellent offenses and deep coverage allow it to function as an effective mixed attacker, slicing through a huge portion of the metagame, including defensive staples such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, and Blissey. Additionally, Aegislash's superb defensive traits mean it takes relatively little from their attacks in return, allowing it to find repeated entry against them, as well as soft-check dangerous offensive threats such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Aerodactyl, and Alakazam. Close Combat forms perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Ball, ensuring Aegislash can consistently threaten the likes of Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Greninja. King's Shield provides Aegislash with defensive security against potential revenge killers such as Tyranitar and Hydreigon while scouting Choice item Pokemon such as Keldeo and Iron Boulder. Shadow Sneak gives Aegislash a valuable priority move that can pick off faster threats such as Blacephalon, Iron Boulder, and Mega Gallade. Alternatively, Toxic allows Aegislash to cripple specially defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Galarian Moltres, and Hippowdon which would otherwise be able to check it, letting Aegislash wear them down effectively in conjunction with King's Shield. Flash Cannon provides a secondary STAB move that consistently threatens Clefable while OHKOing Mega Aerodactyl and Tapu Bulu, something which Shadow Ball into Shadow Sneak cannot do; however, it has little use outside of this. Even with this set's offensively oriented nature, Leftovers is crucial to provide Aegislash with passive recovery, allowing it to leverage its defensive traits and find more opportunities to attack. If longevity isn't a concern, Ghostium Z and Spell Tag are options that can be used on more aggressive teams to boost Shadow Ball's power, letting Aegislash muscle through defensive checks such as Mega Venusaur, Scizor, and Celesteela with greater ease. The given EVs, besides maximizing its Special Attack, ensure Aegislash can 2HKO Chansey with Close Combat after Stealth Rock and outspeed defensive Celesteela, with 240 EVs in HP allowing Aegislash to survive absurdly strong attacks such as Excadrill's Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Tyranitar's Knock Off. Alternatively, Aegislash can opt to run more Speed EVs over HP to outpace various targets, including Scizor, defensive Buzzwole, and Azumarill. However, this comes at the significant cost of cutting into Aegislash's bulk, often compounded by the need to run a Defense-lowering nature. Mixed Aegislash fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its incredible combination of traits, from breaking down defensive cores with its immediate power to checking faster offensive threats such as Alakazam. Defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Clefable synergize well with Aegislash's ability to deal with the likes of Mega Gardevoir and Enamorus. In return, they can help manage threats such as Iron Moth and Tyranitar, which otherwise force Aegislash out, and set entry hazards to help it break through checks such as Celesteela and Hippowdon. Similarly, other wallbreakers such as Iron Boulder, Iron Moth, and Keldeo greatly benefit from Aegislash's ability to pivot into faster revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Mega Aerodactyl as well as its ability to capitalize on defensive Pokemon that they may struggle to break through in Skarmory and Blissey. Finally, Aegislash greatly appreciates teammates which can help cripple its few defensive checks; Serperior can lure in Mega Venusaur and Iron Moth and paralyze them with Glare, making it easier for Aegislash to overwhelm them. Offensive pivots like Zeraora and Scizor can use Knock Off to cripple checks reliant on their item, such as Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth; these two can also use Volt Switch and U-turn to ensure Aegislash can find safe entry into potential targets such as Buzzwole and Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Bulky Swords Dance Aegislash serves as a terrifying approach to its traditional role as a wallbreaker and setup sweeper, giving up immediate threat potential for incredible resilience. Notably, Aegislash's bulk and passive healing allow it to take repeated hits from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Iron Moth, giving it extra turns to set up and break through them late-game. Shadow Sneak, especially once boosted by Swords Dance, gives Aegislash a priority move to clean up weakened teams with; it notably OHKOes Iron Boulder and Mega Gallade at +2 and can OHKO Iron Moth and offensive Excadrill at +4. Close Combat is Aegislash's strongest move overall and serves as important coverage against common Ghost-type checks such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Ting-Lu, OHKOing the latter at +2. King's Shield reverts Aegislash to its Shield forme, preventing it from being reliably revenge killed by faster threats such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Iron Moth and maximizes the amount of recovery gained from Leftovers. Alternatively, Shadow Claw provides Aegislash with a stronger STAB move that can tear through several weakened Fighting-resistant targets at +2, such as Amoonguss, Clefable, and Buzzwole. This Aegislash variant only fits on bulkier teams due to its lack of immediate offensive output and methodical playstyle. Entry hazards from defensive Pokemon, such as Clefable, Gastrodon, and Skarmory, are critical to its gameplan, weakening common Pokemon such as Excadrill, Mega Venusaur, and Hydrapple to where Aegislash is able to pick them off. In return, Aegislash can use its defensive profile to threaten out offensive Pokemon that may take advantage of their passivity, such as Mega Gardevoir, Reuniclus, and Alakazam. Additionally, as Aegislash is very weak to status conditions such as Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Knock Off from Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth, which can also negate its Leftovers recovery, it appreciates partnering with other defensive teammates that can absorb these effects for it, notably Amoonguss, Slowbro, and Blissey. Slowbro and Blissey also provide Aegislash with slow pivoting in Teleport, allowing it to preserve its HP more effectively when trying to set up. By extension, offensive pivots such as Zeraora, Victini, and Iron Moth are also valuable teammates, as they can help weaken or deal with several of Aegislash's checks early in the game, like Hippowdon, Foul Play Amoonguss, and Buzzwole.</p>"

Extreme Speed offers priority that lets Zygarde revenge kill faster offensive threats such as Alakazam and Booster Energy Iron Moth. Outrage has solid neutral coverage with Thousand Arrows and is a valuable STAB move to hit walls like Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur.

Zygarde-10% finds itself on offensive teams that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities against common defensive cores like Celesteela and Rotom-W. These teams can further support Zygarde-10%, which partners well with offensive pivots such as Scizor, Slowbro, and Rotom-W that can help Zygarde-10% hit the field. In addition, Slowbro provides Future Sight support, which can be valuable in breaking through answers such as Buzzwole. In return, Zygarde-10% pressures walls that give these Pokemon issues such as Rotom-W and Celesteela.

Steam Eruption, in addition to being a powerful STAB option, is also very useful at spreading burns in order to weaken potential checks such as Mega Venusaur and Slowking. Sludge Bomb is used in order to break Clefable and Tapu Fini while also heavily damaging switch-ins such as Mega Latias and Hydreigon with a chance to poison them. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used in order to combat Slowbro and Gastrodon that would otherwise easily switch into Volcanion. Volcanion also offers some utility with Defog, being able to use its offensive capabilities to force out common entry hazard setters such as Tyranitar, Skarmory, and Hippowdon and clear hazards as they flee. Taunt is another utility option that allows Volcanion to shut down the likes of Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Fini more efficiently while also preventing Slowking and Slowbro from using Teleport and Slack Off. Alternatively, Volcanion can forego its utility options in exchange for Earth Power in order to target threats such as Okidogi and other Volcanion. Heavy-Duty Boots is Volcanion's main item of choice in order to avoid damage from entry hazards, but it can also run Shuca Berry on more offensive playstyles in order to lure threats attempting to use Ground-type attacks against it, such as Excadrill and Enamorus. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon make for a solid offensive core with Volcanion, as Volcanion can switch into and pressure their checks in Clefable while they handle its checks in Slowking. Physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl also enjoy Volcanion's Water-type immunity, allowing it to absorb Scald from the likes of Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon. Volcanion is capable of pressuring a ton of offensive threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Zeraora, as they are unable to switch into it properly, but unfortunately the inverse can also be said for it, since its mediocre Speed leaves it outpaced by the aforementioned threats and others, such as Iron Moth. To mitigate this, speed control options such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Enamorus are vital in order to force them out more easily. In return, Volcanion can provide a switch-in to Tapu Fini for them while also pressuring defensive checks such as Amoonguss and Celesteela. Volcanion hates dealing with offensive Ground-types such as Excadrill due to its inability to switch into them, so partners like Skarmory are very useful at keeping them at bay. In return, Volcanion can handle threats that would try to take advantage of Skarmory such as Aegislash and Tapu Fini. Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zeraora are also incredibly annoying for Volcanion, so partners such as Gastrodon, Mega Latias, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth are good at handling them. In return, Volcanion can pressure threats such as Amoonguss and Celesteela for them. Although Volcanion can beat Rock-types in theory, Tyranitar and Mega Aerodactyl can pressure it really easily if on the field. Partners such as Scizor are great at forcing them out, and in return, Volcanion can deal with Iron Defense Skarmory and Amoonguss for them. Dragon-type wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Mega Latias can also take advantage of Volcanion by merit of resisting both its STAB moves. Partners such as Celesteela, Clefable, and Tyranitar can effectively force them out for Volcanion.</p>"

  "Primarina": {
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>With its good typing complemented by Assault Vest, Primarina becomes a potent tank capable of forcing out and soaking hits from several of the metagame's most terrifying special attackers, including mixed Aegislash, Hydrapple, and Enamorus as well as others such as physical attackers such as Victini and Buzzwole while it's healthy. Additionally, by virtue of its strong offensive traits and utility options in Flip Turn and Psychic Noise, Primarina retains a strong matchup against common defensive cores, heavily threatening the likes of Clefable, Mega Venusaur, Slowbro, and Skarmory. However, Primarina's middling physical bulk in conjunction with the prevalence of entry hazards often limits its ability to perform these roles long-term, preventing it from seeing consistent use outside of highly aggressive team structures. Scald is preferred due to its ability to cripple the likes of defensive Scizor, Celesteela, and Rotom-W. However, Surf's higher Base Power allows Primarina to match up better against several offensive Pokemon, having significant odds to OHKO Iron Boulder, Iron Moth, and Victini from full HP. Flip Turn capitalizes on the many switches Primarina forces against offensive and defensive Pokemon alike while allowing its teammates to hit the field safely against would-be answers such as Slowking and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Lastly, Psychic Noise not only provides Primarina with critical coverage against Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which would otherwise check it, but can also prevent the likes of Chansey, Blissey, and Calm Mind Clefable from using their recovery options, allowing Primarina to wear them down for itself and its team. 44 Speed EVs allow Primarina to outspeed uninvested Scizor, while the rest of the EVs is put into its Special Attack and HP to make Primarina as offensively adept as possible. Assault Vest Primarina is best used on offense teams that appreciate not only a check to dangerous special attackers such as Hydrapple but also its ability to function as a backbone against more defensive structures. Fast, frail wallbreakers such as Iron Boulder, Alakazam, and Mega Gallade benefit the most from Primarina's role compression, with the latter being pivotal in wearing down potential defensive checks such as Aegislash and Clefable while also handling revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. In return, these Pokemon can assist with breaking through several of Primarina's checks, such as Mega Venusaur and Slowking, and they also provide a way to actively pressure offensive Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Galarian Moltres, and Life Orb Mienshao, which are capable of overwhelming Primarina with time. Similarly, other offensive Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Victini, Scizor, and Okidogi pair well with Primarina, forcing out Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth while appreciating Primarina's ability to threaten physically defensive checks such as Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Skeledirge. Mega Aerodactyl serves as a good speed control option that threatens potential revenge killers such as Psyshock Alakazam and Zeraora, while Victini and Scizor can provide extra support with U-turn to help Primarina get onto the field safely while benefiting from the latter's use of Flip Turn against specially defensive Pokemon such as Slowking in return. Additionally, bulkier wallbreakers such as Aegislash and Hydrapple synergize quite well with Primarina, easily overwhelming the likes of Celesteela and Blissey in tandem while fulfilling the role of a useful blanket check to dangerous physical attackers such as Iron Boulder and Excadrill. Lastly, hazard removal options such as Defog from Rotom-W, Serperior, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon as well as Rapid Spin from Excadrill and Dhelmise are instrumental in ensuring that Primarina isn't being worn down by hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, which could otherwise cripple its ability to switch into the likes of mixed Aegislash and Victini.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ribombee is the fastest and most consistent Sticky Web setter in the tier, able to outspeed other leads like Mew to ensure that Sticky Web will go up before Mew can use Taunt. Stun Spore allows Ribombee to paralyze faster threats like Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth and Choice Scarf Enamorus while also ruining setup sweepers that may use it as setup fodder. Tailwind is a great option for Ribombee if it will be immediately KOed after setting Sticky Web, as it allows most partners to outspeed the entire metagame after Sticky Web. U-turn is another option that can scout for switches and create setup opportunities for teammates. While niche, Shield Dust is more relevant than any of Ribombee's other abilities, allowing it to avoid being inflicted with poison or burn from moves like Sludge Bomb and Flare Blitz, giving it another turn to use Stun Spore or Tailwind. Focus Sash allows Ribombee to survive any hit from a faster attacker to ensure Sticky Web goes up. Ribombee works only as a lead on Sticky Web offense teams. Teammates like Mienshao appreciate Sticky Web, as it allows them to outspeed and OHKO threats like Keldeo before they get a chance to retaliate. Defiant users like Bisharp are also useful to punish attempts to use Defog to remove Sticky Web. Ribombee struggles to set entry hazards against Excadrill and Mega Aerodactyl due to Rapid Spin and Dual Wingbeat respectively, so checks to these threats like Celesteela are appreciated. Air Balloon Aegislash is recommended with Ribombee as well, as it can help prevent Excadrill from using Rapid Spin to clear Sticky Web. The turn Ribombee uses to set Sticky Web can be exploited by threats like Swords Dance Scizor and Aegislash, so offensive partners that can handle these threats like Victini and Bisharp are recommended to prevent these threats from sweeping.</p>"

Dhelmise sets itself apart as a spinner from Excadrill through reliable recovery that allows it to more consistently check Ting-Lu and Skarmory in exchange for the greater power and Speed provided by Excadrill. Power Whip allows Dhelmise to punish Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, and Clefable while also hitting Pokémon such as Rotom-W attemping to switch in on Rapid Spin. Poltergeist allows Dhelmise to threaten the aforementioned Ghost-types, in turn allowing it to remove entry hazards more reliably. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove Leftovers from Celesteela and Clefable, which lets Dhelmise more easily wear them down while still threatening Aegislash and Blacephalon with heavy damage. Anchor Shot is an uncommon option that can be used to trap Amoonguss and Clefable as well as force damage on Ting-Lu, but lacking Ghost- or Dark-type coverage greatly impedes Dhelmise's ability to use Rapid Spin. Leftovers is the preferred item on Dhelmise, allowing it to heal passively in front of Ting-Lu and to act more aggressively, but Colbur Berry can be used to tank Knock Off from Tyranitar and OHKO it in return. The given EV spread allows Dhelmise to OHKO Shield Forme Aegislash lacking HP investment with Poltergeist and outspeed Hippowdon, with the remaining bulk in Special Defense to help against Clefable as well as threats like Keldeo and Mega Gardevoir in a pinch. While Dhelmise can use Rapid Spin against many of the tier's best hazard setters, options like Brave Bird Skarmory, Toxic Hippowdon, and Tyranitar can threaten or wear down Dhelmise and prevent it from removing hazards. Answers to these hazard setters like Rotom-W and Celesteela are appreciated; in return, Dhelmise can answer Ting-Lu and Zeraora looking to switch into them. Additionally, Dhelmise struggles to switch into many of the tier's premier threats, such as Iron Moth, Iron Boulder, Mega Venusaur, and Aegislash. For these reasons, Dhelmise is typically only seen on teams looking to enable powerful threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Specs Enamorus; partners like Scizor and Mienshao that can help pivot in such options are recommended. Partners like Ting-Lu and Celesteela can help Dhelmise utilize its minimal defensive utility by checking Fighting- and Water-types like Mienshao and Keldeo, and they ensure teams don't crumple against threats like Iron Moth, Mega Venusaur, and Aegislash.</p>"

On top of this, Tapu Bulu's solid defensive profile also allows it to serve as an effective check to certain offensive threats such as Thundurus, Zeraora, and Keldeo, while Grassy Surge allows it to support its team with additional passive recovery, as well as lessening the damage of Earthquake, a common attacking move seen on Pokemon such as Excadrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Ting-Lu. However, Tapu Bulu's common weaknesses to attacking types such as Fire, Flying, and Steel, mediocre Speed tier, and heavy reliance on prediction to get past certain walls such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela tend to limit its consistency in the long run. In addition, Grassy Terrain, while beneficial, can also backfire due to it healing opposing grounded Pokemon as well. Stone Edge gives Tapu Bulu a way to hit Fire- and Flying-types such as Victini and Thundurus; when powered up by Rockium Z, it turns into a perfectly accurate move that also deals enormous damage to natural targets such as Celesteela, Amoonguss, and Mega Latias at +2, letting it break through them. High Horsepower gives Tapu Bulu a way to hit Steel-types such as Aegislash, Excadrill, and Bisharp super effectively. The given EV spread maximizes Tapu Bulu's bulk, whilst allowing it to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar and Modest Celesteela. Alternatively, a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be used to maximize Tapu Bulu's offensive potential, most notably ensuring a guaranteed OHKO on maximum HP Aegislash with High Horsepower and defensive Celesteela and Amoonguss with Contential Crush at +2. By virtue of its defensive qualities, Tapu Bulu is best suited to defensive teams which can capitalize on its long-term prowess. Pokemon such as Aegislash, Excadrill, and Slowking each appreciate the residual effects brought on by Grassy Terrain, which can allow them to play more aggressively; in return, these Pokemon can help pivot into several of Tapu Bulu's answers, such as Celesteela and Mega Venusaur, while Slowking also helps check Fire-types such as Victini. Additionally, other defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Slowbro, Clefable, and Hippowdon can also benefit from Grassy Surge while supporting Tapu Bulu's team against offensive threats such as Iron Moth, in addition to providing entry hazards and pivoting support. However, it should be noted that Ting-Lu and Hippowdon will often need to run alternative Ground-type STAB options to remain effective under Grassy Terrain. Faster teammates such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Mienshao can assist in revenge killing Tapu Bulu’s checks, and they benefit from Tapu Bulu's ability to help them overwhelm pivots such as Celesteela, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Tapu Fini's solid typing, good bulk, and vast utility make it an excellent defensive presence in the metagame, holding the tier together against numerous Pokemon, such as Mienshao and Keldeo. Misty Surge makes it excellent at regaining momentum against status users, such as Clefable and Blissey, allowing setup teammates like Iron Boulder to more freely set up against these Pokemon. Scald provides Tapu Fini with a STAB move that can burn the likes of Celesteela and Tapu Bulu attempting to take advantage of it while also letting it apply pressure to targets such as Iron Moth and Victini. Alternatively, Nature's Madness allows Tapu Fini to hit defensive Pokemon it would otherwise be unable to punish for switching in, Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Defog keeps entry hazards off against walls that its typing enables it to match up well against, like Skarmory. Taunt, besides preventing the aforementioned Pokemon from relaying hazards in front of Tapu Fini, also denies healing and setup attempts from Pokemon like Clefable and Blissey, particularly when used in combination with Nature's Madness to more quickly wear down said targets. 64 Speed EVs ensure that Tapu Fini outruns Adamant Tyranitar, while the rest is put into Defense to maximize its walling capabilities against Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Excadrill. Defog Tapu Fini fits onto many bulky offense and balance teams for its valuable role compression. Tapu Fini is prone to being overwhelmed and lacks any form of healing outside of Leftovers, which makes other defensive Pokemon that can support it against the aforementioned threats extremely valuable; these include Pokemon such as Skarmory and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Wish users such as Jirachi and Blissey are also highly noticeable in this regard for their ability to keep Tapu Fini healthy throughout the game in addition to synergizing with it immensely by handling special attackers that can threaten Tapu Fini, such as Alakazam. Other defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Aggron benefit from Tapu Fini's ability to clear hazards, allowing them to more safely leverage their HP to check the threats they are meant to deal with. Finally, powerful offensive Pokemon that appreciate Misty Terrain's effects, like Bisharp and Choice Band Tyranitar, also enjoy being able to fall back on Tapu Fini to deal with offensive threats like Keldeo and clear hazards, improving their potential to wallbreak throughout the game.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can outspeed and revenge kill common offensive Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Alakazam. Additionally, Tapu Fini can still uphold its natural defensive qualities and bulk to switch into other threats like Victini and Keldeo when needed, before outspeeding and threatening them too, while also providing Defog support. Hydro Pump is Tapu Fini's strongest move to hit Iron Moth and Excadrill with, OHKOing both after Stealth Rock damage, but Surf can be used instead if accuracy is a concern despite having less power. Trick allows Tapu Fini to cripple an incoming wall that would normally try to take advantage of it, like Blissey and Amoonguss. Defog allows Tapu Fini to clear entry hazards for its team in a pinch, especially once it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf, but if Defog is already found on another Pokemon, Taunt and Nature's Madness are options that can be used instead to further mess with most defensive Pokemon, chipping them down quickly or denying healing attempts. The given EV spread ensures that Tapu Fini survives a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha and outspeeds Mega Aerodactyl. Tapu Fini fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its defensive utility and role compression. Wallbreakers that benefit from its ability to check faster offensive threats like Keldeo and Mienshao include Pokemon such as Choice Band Tyranitar and Mega Heracross, with each additionally benefiting from Misty Terrain's status immunity. On the other hand, Tapu Fini's tendency to lure in defensive Pokemon that it can Trick its Choice Scarf over to, like Blissey and Chansey, can be exploited by Pokemon that normally struggle to break past them, such as Iron Moth and Nasty Plot Hydreigon. As Tapu Fini can struggle to check threats like Life Orb Mienshao and Hisuian Zoroark in the long run, other Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Galarian Moltres can help provide extra insurance against these Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Tapu Fini utilizes its fantastic bulk and typing to strangle offensive and defensive teams alike; the former is often reliant on accruing chip damage with Pokemon like Buzzwole, Excadrill, and Aegislash throughout the game to wear down Tapu Fini, which it can heal off with boosted Draining Kiss, while the latter relies on status moves from Celesteela, Blissey, and Clefable, which are shut down by both Misty Terrain and Taunt. Draining Kiss best utilizes the buffer against status granted by Misty Terrain, as Tapu Fini can spend these turns setting up in front of the aforementioned would-be checks while using Draining Kiss to take advantage of the high HP stats of targets like Ting-Lu, Hydrapple, and Blissey. Scald allows Tapu Fini to burn Pokemon like Celesteela that aren't affected by Misty Terrain, punish Tapu Bulu switching in and replacing Terrain, and, given Tapu Fini's propensity to remain on the field after its Terrain has expired, provide greater utility than stronger STAB move options. Taunt is essential to stifle attempts from Blissey, Celesteela, and Aegislash to cripple Tapu Fini with Toxic or Leech Seed as well as ensure other foes such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu are unable to set entry hazards or phaze it. The given EV spread allows Tapu Fini to outspeed Aegislash and Magnezone that have a Speed-boosting nature. Calm Mind Tapu Fini is typically seen on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to break through weakened teams is appreciated by powerful wallbreakers like Iron Boulder, Swords Dance Scizor, and Aegislash; these teammates also appreciate Tapu Fini protecting them from status while not utilizing status themselves to wallbreak. Tapu Fini often needs multiple turns to set up, during which attackers like Iron Moth, Zeraora, and Mega Venusaur can threaten it out; teammates like Mega Aerodactyl and Scizor can help handle these foes and wear down defensive checks to Tapu Fini like Celesteela and Amoonguss. Due to its reliance on Leftovers for healing, Tapu Fini can also find it hard to check physical attackers that use Knock Off that it would otherwise wall such as Mienshao and Scizor. Alternate checks for these Pokemon like Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur are appreciated for their ability to take Knock Off.</p>"

      "Whirlpool Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>Whirlpool trapper Tapu Fini is one of the tier's most reliable trappers, being able to lure in, trap, and whittle down defensive behemoths like Celesteela, Mega Venusaur, Clefable, Slowbro, and Slowking with Whirlpool in conjunction with Taunt. While Tapu Fini may not be able to finish off some of these foes by itself, it weakens them enough for partners like Scizor, Keldeo, and Hydrapple to break through them and take over the game afterwards. Nature's Madness gives Tapu Fini a consistent way to hit Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela for massive damage, as they would otherwise be able to shrug off its attacks. Moonblast is the most reliable move to finish off defensive options chipped down to low health by Whirlpool and Nature's Madness. 56 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Tapu Fini to always survive Leaf Storm from Hydrapple after Stealth Rock, which extends its trapping capabilities, while also letting it handle mixed Aegislash better. The provided Defense and Speed EVs let Tapu Fini almost always survive Adamant Zeraora's Plasma Fists after Stealth Rock and outspeed Adamant Tyranitar. Whirlpool trapper Tapu Fini is typically seen on offense teams alongside specific setup sweepers, primarily Scizor, Hydrapple, Mega Latias, and Serperior, that appreciate their checks being weakened, such as Celesteela, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss. While its role does overlap somewhat with Magnezone, as both are options to remove Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor, Tapu Fini makes up for its reliance on a trapping move with its valuable defensive presence on offense teams, capable of being a temporary stopgap against dangerous attackers like Mienshao, Mega Gallade, and Keldeo; its ability to spread damage more reliably than Magnezone with Nature's Madness; and Misty Terrain protecting teammates from status. Teammates like Mega Aerodactyl and Ting-Lu form strong temporary defensive cores with Tapu Fini, able to handle threats like Iron Moth and Zeraora for it, while it takes on Scizor and Mienshao in return. Strong cleaners like Iron Boulder and Swords Dance Aegislash appreciate Tapu Fini's ability to remove key checks, spread damage reliably, and deny recovery, allowing them to more easily pick apart weakened teams late-game. Finally, Pursuit users like Bisharp and Tyranitar can be great teammates that ensure that Pokemon weakened by Tapu Fini, such as Slowking and Mega Venusaur, cannot escape and attempt to heal back up later in the game.</p>"

  "Buzzwole": {
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Using its impressive HP and Defense stats alongside its unique set of resistances and decent Speed tier, Buzzwole becomes a stellar physical wall capable of consistently answering some of the metagame's most dangerous physical attackers, such as Mienshao, Excadrill, Swords Dance Aegislash, and Scizor. Close Combat is preferred over Drain Punch because its higher Base Power allows it to deal with Roost variants of Scizor more effectively while making it less passive against bulky Pokemon such as Hydrapple and Celesteela. Earthquake OHKOes Iron Moth on the switch and prevents Okidogi and Aegislash lacking Air Balloon from taking advantage of it. Toxic allows Buzzwole to punish a wide range of defensive Pokemon, most notably Mega Latias, Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon; its effectiveness at spreading it is compounded by the number of opportunities Buzzwole gets against the plethora of physical attackers it can force out. Alternatively, Bulk Up can help improve its matchups into attackers such as Scizor and Iron Boulder and turns it into a potent win condition that can power through weakened defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Slowking; increasing its Defense stat also allows Buzzwole to stay in against physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Victini in a pinch and KO them back. Lastly, Roost provides Buzzwole with a consistent recovery option that allows it to stay healthy in the face of pivoting moves such as U-turn from Mienshao and Scizor as well as sand when facing Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Band Tyranitar. Heavy-Duty Boots are preferred to ensure Buzzwole isn't being worn down by entry hazards. However, on teams with consistent hazard removal, Rocky Helmet and Leftovers are alternative items that can assist Buzzwole by punishing the use of contact moves from Scizor and Excadrill with additional chip damage and providing passive healing, respectively. The given EV spread allows Buzzwole to outpace Adamant Azumarill and 2HKO maximum HP Scizor with Close Combat from full, with the rest in Defense to allow Buzzwole to survive all but the strongest physical attacks, including Iron Boulder's Continental Crush and Excadrill's Corkscrew Crash after a Swords Dance, though it is worth noting that Buzzwole can also run additional Speed EVs to outpace specific threats such as Swords Dance Aegislash and Tyranitar, improving its matchups against them at the cost of some physical bulk. With its immense defensive profile and decent offenses, Buzzwole can fit on various bulky offense and balance teams alike. Fast, frail attackers such as Iron Moth, Alakazam, and Mega Aerodactyl benefit the most from Buzzwole's ability to stave off common bulky attackers such as Scizor and Tyranitar that are often used to respond to them. In return, these Pokemon can help pressure several special attackers that may otherwise force Buzzwole out, notably Enamorus, Mega Gardevoir, and Keldeo. Similarly, other defensive staples such as Celesteela, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Aegislash can pair well with Buzzwole, checking several of the aforementioned special attackers while appreciating Buzzwole's ability to stave off physical attackers such as Life Orb Mienshao and Bisharp and absorb potential attempts to cripple them with Knock Off. Buzzwole also appreciates Knock Off and hazard support from Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, each of which can help chip down defensive walls such as Celesteela, Skeledirge, and Amoonguss, supplementing Buzzwole's offenses while potentially opening up opportunities for it to sweep late-game with Bulk Up.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Buzzwole combines its naturally high Attack stat with its colorful coverage options to serve as a powerful wallbreaker, and unlike other Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, it does this while retaining great defensive utility between its stellar physical bulk and resistances. This allows it to consistently find opportunities against opposing offensive threats such as Mienshao and Tyranitar. Earthquake provides solid neutral coverage with Close Combat, OHKOing Iron Moth while also 2HKOing Aegislash and Skeledirge. Poison Jab can chunk Clefable and Tapu Fini attempting to switch in while hitting Enamorus and Azumarill super effectively. Roost provides Buzzwole with a form of reliable recovery, allowing it to leverage its defensive profile against potential threats such as Scizor long-term. Fist Plate strengthens Close Combat's power, allowing it to consistently 2HKO defensive Celesteela and Gastrodon. Alternatively, Life Orb also boosts the power of its coverage moves at the cost of sustaining recoil damage, notably allowing it to 2HKO physically defensive Clefable with Poison Jab. 188 Speed EVs ensure Buzzwole outruns maximum Speed Aegislash and Magnezone. Offensive Buzzwole fits best on bulkier teams in need of its firepower and natural defensive traits against potential threats such as Scizor and Tapu Bulu. Defensive Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Tapu Fini each possess excellent synergy with Buzzwole; Buzzwole provides them with much needed security and a point of entry against the Dark- and Fighting-types, such as Mienshao, Tyranitar, and Zarude, which are capable of threatening or wearing them down; Rotom-W and Tapu Fini provide crucial hazard control to ensure Buzzwole's wallbreaking prowess isn't limited by entry hazards, whereas Slowking provides Future Sight support to help Buzzwole break down certain defensive Pokemon that would otherwise stop it, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Clefable can force additional chip damage onto physically defensive walls such as Tangrowth. Ting-Lu and Clefable also help play around dangerous Psychic-types such as Mega Latias and Reuniclus, which are capable of using Buzzwole as setup fodder. Additionally, Clefable can use Knock Off to remove items like Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Heavy-Duty Boots from Slowking, making it easier for Buzzwole to break past these Pokemon as well. Lastly, Buzzwole also necessitates faster teammates in order to revenge kill the myriad of threats that are capable of outspeeding and forcing it out, such as Iron Moth and Alakazam. Teammates such as Iron Boulder, Zeraora, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf Enamorus are all good examples that can assist in this aspect.</p>"

Leech Seed serves as Celesteela's main recovery move, capitalizing on the many switches it forces while also being able to deter incoming walls such as Rotom-W and Ting-Lu, which may otherwise try and take advantage of it. Heavy Slam acts as Celesteela's main STAB attack; with its massive weight, Celesteela threatens to OHKO Iron Boulder, Mega Aerodactyl, and Alakazam, on top of being able to 2HKO physically defensive Clefable. On the other hand, Air Slash deals more damage to Grass- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Keldeo, preventing the former two from switching in to absorb its Leech Seed and deterring the latter from trying to use it as setup fodder. Protect allows Celesteela to accrue recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers as well as scout the intentions of Choice item users such as Tyranitar. However, Toxic is also a relevant option, assisting Celesteela against Regenerator pivots such as Assault Vest Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Slowking. Flamethrower OHKOes most Scizor sets and provides a coverage option for other Steel-types such as Aegislash, Skarmory, and opposing Celesteela. Alternatively, at the cost of its ability to hit several of the aforementioned Pokemon, Earthquake gives Celesteela a more reliable option to hit Iron Moth and Magnezone, preventing them from KOing it in return. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment give Celesteela the best odds at surviving attacks from the likes of Alakazam, Hydreigon, and Aegislash. Alternatively, 96 Defense EVs in conjunction with a Relaxed nature improve Celesteela's ability to take on physical attackers, most notably avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave after Leftovers recovery. Defensive Celesteela fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its lack of passivity over Skarmory, being comfortable with falling back on it without losing momentum against threats such as Mega Latias and Hydreigon. Walls such as Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Slowking appreciate Celesteela's ability to help cover several of the aforementioned Dragon-, Psychic-, and Grass-type threats. In return, they can help supplement Celesteela's ability to spread chip damage through the use of entry hazards or status moves as well as answer threats that may overwhelm it, such as Swords Dance Iron Boulder and Keldeo. On the other hand, faster revenge killers such as Zeraora, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Sand Rush Excadrill are similarly effective at keeping these Pokemon, as well as other setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres, in check; the former two are also able to assist Celesteela in breaking down walls with Knock Off, whereas Excadrill can utilize Rapid Spin to ensure it isn't being worn down by Stealth Rock. Lastly, Celesteela is very reliant on Leftovers for recovery; the likes of Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Alakazam can opt to exploit this by luring it with Knock Off; thus, Knock Off absorbers such as Mega Venusaur and Scizor can prove vital while attempting to scout these Pokemon.</p>"

      "Autotomize Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Celesteela's high Special Attack, good movepool, and snowballing potential with Beast Boost make it a great sweeper when using Autotomize to shore up its poor Speed. Its naturally great bulk and Steel/Flying typing afford it setup opportunities against foes like Scizor and Excadrill, as well as the ability to easily muscle past them. Meteor Beam combined with Power Herb lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack without needing a KO. Given that it's Celesteela's strongest attack, in some situations it should be saved to instead target a foe Celesteela would otherwise have trouble breaking through like Skeledirge or Victini. Air Slash serves as a spammable STAB attack, 2HKOing most of the tier at +1, though it can OHKO many Bug- and Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Mienshao unboosted. Its chance to flinch its foes can also come in handy against special walls like Gastrodon and Slowking, which could otherwise stop Celesteela's sweep. Fire Blast primarily targets Steel-types, OHKOing foes like Scizor unboosted and opposing Celesteela after a few boosts. Celesteela best fits on offense teams looking for a cleaner, forming a potent offensive combination with other sweepers like Bisharp. Alternatively, if the opportunity arises, it can instead be used as a mid-game wallbreaker and have a teammate clean using the holes it creates. However, it has no way to break through certain special walls like Blissey and Chansey on its own, making physical attackers like Bisharp and Mienshao necessary. While they share some overlapping counterplay, special sweepers like Booster Energy Iron Moth and Galarian Moltres also appreciate Celesteela's support for similar reasons, and they can still support each other by weakening some of each other's shared checks, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Mega Latias. Entry hazard setters like Lead Mew and Excadrill are crucial for their ability to weaken Celesteela's checks, making it harder for foes like Gastrodon and Tapu Fini to remain healthy enough to check Celesteela.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Blacephalon is an incredibly frail but incredibly difficult Pokemon to switch into, as most defensive options get 2HKOed, and if it's kept healthy, it can quickly snowball out of control due to Beast Boost and its ability to threaten defensive targets like Celesteela, Mega Venusaur, and Slowking. Fire Blast is preferred despite its inaccuracy, as it’s a very strong attack capable of OHKOing Hydrapple and 2HKOing Hydreigon, while Flamethrower is reasonably weaker but is more reliable against most Pokemon. Hidden Power Grass deals with Gastrodon while being able to potentially 2HKO offensive Tyranitar, which would revenge kill it otherwise. Psychic takes out Pokemon like Iron Moth as well as being able to remove Mega Venusaur more easily. Overheat can be used alongside Flamethrower to serve as a hard-hitting attack, almost always OHKOing Clefable as well as Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock. Trick is essential to cripple walls like Ting-Lu and Blissey, which would otherwise take Blacephalon's attacks with ease. Blacephalon fits best on more offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break holes in almost any defensive Pokemon for late-game wincons like Swords Dance Scizor, Alakazam, and Swords Dance Iron Boulder to sweep. Blacephalon is very frail and struggles to take even resisted attacks, so pivots like Rotom-W and Slowking are required to get Blacephalon into the field to break the opposing team. Rotom-W in particular can also remove entry hazards for Blacephalon, as its Stealth Rock weakness can wear it down extremely quickly. Even though it can deal massive damage to most Pokemon, it still can’t touch Pokemon like defensive Tyranitar and Blissey without sacrificing its Choice Specs due to their massive special bulk, so teammates like Mienshao and Buzzwole are necessary to deal with these. Blacephalon also struggles with revenge killers and faster threats like Iron Boulder, Keldeo, Zeraora, and Pokémon with priority moves like Bisharp and Azumarill, so checks to these Pokemon like Slowking, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Celesteela are very helpful for Blacephalon to have a defensive backbone against more offensive teams.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its sky-high Special Attack and snowball potential due to Beast Boost, Blacephalon acts as a niche but very scary setup sweeper capable of breaking through defensive Pokemon like Celesteela and Slowking. Additionally, Blacephalon can use Z-Moves to break walls it normally wouldn't, allowing it to snowball with Beast Boost much faster. Bloom Doom gives Blacephalon much-needed coverage against would-be checks like Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Substitute can be used with Ghostium Z to easily set up without worrying about priority attacks like Aegislash's Shadow Sneak and Bisharp's Sucker Punch from stopping a sweep early, as well as preventing status from crippling it, while using Never-Ending Nightmare to safely get KOs that it normally wouldn't have, such as OHKOing Clefable, Mega Latias, and Mega Venusaur with Stealth Rock, all after a boost. The EV spread guarantees a Speed boost from Beast Boost, as well as being able to survive a unboosted Zen Headbutt from Mega Gallade and a Shadow Sneak from an Aegislash with 8 Attack EVs after Stealth Rock. Calm Mind Blacephalon is most useful on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its unmatched ability to sweep through a weakened team while being able to lure in and take a KO on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Tyranitar, which Pokemon like Galarian Moltres and Iron Moth can capitalize on to sweep themselves. Even with its immense power, Blacephalon struggles to take KOs without a Calm Mind boost, so entry hazard support from hazard leads like Excadrill and Mew are useful for chipping its checks into range of its attacks. Excadrill in particular can also reliably remove hazards, which is amazing for Blacephalon, as its weakness to Stealth Rock can easily put it into range of attacks. Pokemon like Greninja and Iron Moth are also amazing teammates, (AC) as they can weaken shared checks like Mega Venusaur and Ting-Lu for each other so one of them can clean up. It also struggles massively with other Pokemon that can reliably outspeed it before it stacks up any boosts like Zeraora, Greninja, and Iron Boulder, so Pokemon that can reliably take care of these Pokemon like Aegislash, Serperior, and your own Iron Boulder are great partners.</p>"

Additionally, Zeraora packs significant utility options in Knock Off and Volt Switch that can capitalize on the aforementioned traits and even allow it to make long-term progress against a majority of defensive targets, such as Ting-Lu and Rotom-W. Toxic is usually Zeraora's preferred move in the last slot, allowing it to stifle specific Pokemon that are otherwise able to heal off and withstand its attacks, such as Mega Latias and Hippowdon. Alternatively, Zeraora can also make use of Close Combat to pose an immediate threat to most Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Excadrill, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar. On the other hand, Grass Knot is an alternative that puts immediate pressure on Hippowdon and Quagsire, though it becomes more difficult for Zeraora to break through several of the aforementioned targets in Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Excadrill. An Adamant nature maximizes Zeraora's power, ensuring it can secure the OHKO against threats such as Galarian Moltres and Autotomize Celesteela with Plasma Fists. However, a Jolly nature allows Zeraora to outspeed Adamant Mega Aerodactyl. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Zeraora isn't hampered by entry hazards. Zeraora fits best on bulkier teams that appreciate its proficiency in revenge killing offensive threats while possessing added longevity and the ability to generate momentum. Defensive staples such as Slowking appreciate Zeraora's ability to force out Pokemon that may threaten them, like Life Orb Mienshao. In return, Slowking can use Future Sight to pressure Pokemon that would otherwise be able to stave off Zeraora's attacks, such as Buzzwole and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, slower wallbreakers like Choice Specs Enamorus, Nasty Plot Hydreigon, and Choice Band Tyranitar appreciate Zeraora's ability to scare out faster Pokemon while also benefitting from the safe switch-in opportunities provided by Volt Switch. While Zeraora's offensive matchups are impressive, it can struggle to contain many offensive threats that are capable of boosting their Speed, such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Booster Energy Iron Boulder, and Autotomize Celesteela. Thus, specific defensive checks to these Pokemon such as defensive Celesteela, Slowbro, and Thunder Wave Clefable are highly appreciated.</p>"

Teams that run this Dracozolt set should note its overreliance on sand to function as well as its mediocre longevity. Draco Meteor is great in order to hit sturdy Ground-types that would otherwise wall Dracozolt such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. The coverage it provides is also valuable to heavily damage Dragon-types such as Hydrapple and Mega Latias. Dragon Claw is another option to hit the same targets but carries a higher risk of losing to physically defensive foes such as Tangrowth and Buzzwole. Fire Blast shores up this issue by directly threatening Buzzwole and Tangrowth while also hitting other options that can handle Bolt Beak, like Amoonguss and Excadrill. Earthquake is a sturdy midground against faster threats Iron Boulder and Victini that OHKOes Excadrill but doesn't hit much else. Substitute allows Dracozolt to take advantage of foes such as Rotom-W and Amoonguss by blocking their status moves, and it also lets Dracozolt capitalize on the Ground-types that are forced in by allowing it safety hit its targets without needing to predict as much. Outrage is great to clean up a weakened team but runs the risk of getting exploited by Fairy-types such as Clefable and Steel-types such as Skarmory. Low Kick is another option to target Ting-Lu. If running Draco Meteor or Fire Blast, Dracozolt uses a Naughty nature in order to maximize its damage output. Otherwise, an Adamant nature is best. A Naive or Jolly nature can be used to allow Dracozolt to revenge kill Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth in sand. Life Orb lets Dracozolt maximize its power while remaining flexible, but Choice Band is another option for additional power at the cost of being more prediction-reliantand easier to revenge kill. Traditional sand partners such as Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Excadrill appreciate Dracozolt's ability to remove shared checks in Skarmory and Rotom-W. Additionally, Clefable and Reuniclus enjoy Dracozolt's ability to dispatch Celesteela and Iron Moth. In return, Hippowdon and Tyranitar can provide Dracozolt with both entry hazard support and sand, Excadrill can help overwhelm Dracozolt's checks such as Tangrowth, and Clefable and Reuniclus can assist in removing threats such as Ting-Lu and Buzzwole. Dracozolt can struggle against Sand Rush Excadrill, so partners such as Slowbro and Skarmory can help pressure it while also providing Future Sight and Spikes support.</p>"

Its expansive coverage in Earth Power and Mystical Fire allows it to hit every Steel-type in the tier, such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor, for super effective damage, securing either an OHKO or a 2HKO on them with a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Enamorus to work around other Fairy-resistant foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth as well as offensive checks in Hisuian Arcanine and Victini, while its Speed tier allows it to outspeed and OHKO Mienshao. Taunt is an option to potentially beat and deny recovery from status users like Clefable, Hippowdon, and Chansey that try to slow down or stall Enamorus. Similarly, Iron Moth enjoys many of its checks being removed, particularly Tyranitar and Latias. However, Enamorus's frailty and lack of immediate power makes it difficult for it to break past checks such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela, which threaten to OHKO it with Sludge Bomb and Heavy Slam, respectively, and aren't OHKOed after a Calm Mind boost. Similarly, Chansey can use Toxic and Seismic Toss to take advantage of Enamorus's lack of longevity. This means it appreciates partners such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, which are capable of Pursuit trapping special walls like Chansey, as well as Victini, which can break past Celesteela as well as provide pivoting to bring Enamorus in safely. Its Speed tier also means it is pressured by faster threats such as Iron Moth and Keldeo. This means it enjoys speed control from partners such as Alakazam and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, which are able to outspeed its offensive checks. To compensate for its relative frailty, it also enjoys slow pivots to bring it in safely, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Scizor, and in return it provides an offensive check to the Dark-types they are threatened by, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon.</p>"

In addition to Earth Power and Mystical Fire, Superpower allows it to threaten a 3HKO on Chansey. This also allows Enamorus to potentially snowball through weakened teams once faster foes like Alakazam have been removed. Alternatively, Psychic hits Poison-types that aren't weak to Earth Power, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. In addition to Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, speed control from the likes of Choice Scarf Victini, and slow pivots like Slowbro, Choice Specs Enamorus functions as an excellent partner to special sweepers such as Iron Moth, Keldeo, and Blacephalon due to its ability to remove checks to it without competing for the same team slot. These options can also be used to remove Steel- and Poison-types to allow Enamorus to use its powerful Moonblast more freely. As Enamorus is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates being partnered with strong entry hazard removal options, such as Rapid Spin Excadrill, Defog Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W, which allow it to more easily work around opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and suicide leads like Excadrill. Due to its Choice Specs, however, Enamorus becomes prediction-reliant against teams that stack multiple Fairy-resistant foes, so Stealth Rock and Knock Off support from Clefable, Tyranitar, and Scizor allows it to more effectively break down its checks over the course of a game.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With Choice Scarf, its high Special Attack, and the utility of Healing Wish, Enamorus is an effective form of speed control that can also sweep or facilitate another partner's sweep late-game. Earth Power targets Steel-types like Excadrill and Aegislash, Fire-types like Victini and Iron Moth, and it's also Enamorus's strongest attack against Mega Venusaur. Mystical Fire hits specific Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power, namely Skarmory, Scizor, and Celesteela; its Special Attack-lowering effect also provides some utility against Autotomize variants of the latter. Alternatively, Grass Knot can 2HKO Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Finally, Focus Blast serves as a middle ground option against Steel-types like Excadrill and Skarmory while also OHKOing Tyranitar, though its shaky accuracy combined with Enamorus's frailty makes it risky to use. Enamorus best fits on offense teams looking for a form of speed control that can revenge kill fast threats such as Thundurus. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers such as Excadrill and Tapu Fini are essential teammates. Due to Enamorus's low bulk, pivots such as Thundurus can help it safely get onto the field. Enamorus also appreciates the defensive backbone provided by bulky partners such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Skamory; Pokemon that resist Steel like the latter are important as checks to Scizor and Sand Rush Excadrill. Enamorus lacks the power to OHKO certain foes like Victini and Thundurus from full health, while they can often cripple or OHKO it back, making hazard setters like Excadrill and Mew good partners as they can chip these foes into KO range. Enamorus struggles to get past certain Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, making checks to them like Mega Latias useful. Enamorus also has no way of getting past Blissey and Chansey, making physical wallbreakers such as Buzzwole necessary teammates. Healing Wish is best used to either give a sweeper like Dragon Dance Tyranitar or Celesteela a second opportunity to sweep, or a bulky wallbreaker like Scizor the health needed to continue breaking holes into the opposing team.</p>"

Moonblast alongside Fairium Z grants Enamorus the burst damage to break through Clefable as well as OHKO Pokemon like Rotom-W and Mega Aerodactyl expecting to survive an unboosted Moonblast. Superpower alongside Contrary allows Enamorus to snowball incredibly effectively against slower teams, as it can survive Jirachi's Iron Head at +1, which is often the best switch in against Enamorus on stall teams. It also slams Chansey and lets Enamorus break through Skarmory more easily. Boosting its Defense also allows Enamorus to take hits from defensive and offensive answers alike, such as Heavy Slam Celesteela, Scizor, Mega Gallade, and Choice Scarf Mienshao. Earth Power snipes Iron Moth on the switch in, Aegislash, and the rare Pecharunt or Skeledirge that may be seen on stall teams. Taunt is essential to block recovery and utility moves from defensive Pokemon that Enamorus cannot easily 2HKO like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela. While Fairium Z is generally recommended to give Enamorus the ability to break through Clefable more easily, Leftovers is an option on teams already utilizing the Z-Move elsewhere to grant Enamorus extended longevity, especially against teams where the main mode of damaging it is Chansey and Blissey's Seismic Toss. It also ensures Enamorus remains healthy against bulkier sand teams. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on teams lacking entry hazard removal but requires more precise play with Enamorus to break through stall teams. A Naive nature ensures Enamorus can take advantage of the Defense boost from Superpower more effectively, and it doesn't significantly worsen matchups against revenge killers like Iron Moth and Thundurus. Stallbreaker Enamorus is only seen on offensive teams looking for a threat capable of wearing down defensive structures efficiently. While Enamorus can remove most Pokemon on stall teams, compositions utilizing Mega Venusaur or Amoonguss can make it difficult for Enamorus to easily break through. Teammates like Aegislash, Scizor, and Serperior can help Enamorus wear these two down, handle them defensively, or lure them in and cripple them with status. Enamorus also appreciates their defensive profile, as they are capable of switching into faster threats such as Iron Boulder and Alakazam that force Enamorus out. Enamorus also struggles against more offensive teams due to its middling Speed, lack of consistent wallbreaking power, lack of opportunities to switch in, and reliance on prediction to catch foes on the switch in. Teammates like Ting-Lu, Excadrill, and Tyranitar can temporarily check threats like Iron Moth and Zeraora on offensive teams, as well as provide hazard support to help Enamorus wear down Celesteela and Mega Venusaur. Magnezone is a notable teammate, able to trap and remove Celesteela, Scizor, and Jirachi, which give Enamorus trouble. Enamorus is also weak to Stealth Rock, so teammates like Rotom-W and Excadrill can help mitigate this weakness while also taking advantage of holes left in the opposing team left by Enamorus.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and induces passive damage, allowing Skeledirge to outlast opposing Pokemon. Scorching Sands is an option to hit Iron Moth and Victini for super effective damage while retaining a chance to cripple Tyranitar and Ting-Lu on the switch.

Lokix sports good priority moves such as First Impression and Sucker Punch, which allow it to revenge kill threats such as Mega Latias, Iron Boulder, and Alakazam. Knock Off allows Lokix to force progress against Buzzwole, Clefable, and Celesteela by removing their Leftovers while also being able to punish more offensive checks such as Iron Moth and Mienshao for switching in. Leech Life can be an alternative to Sucker Punch to retain Lokix's longevity against bulkier teams. As a pivot, Lokix values Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent it from being worn down from entry hazards as it comes in and out of the field. Lokix typically runs an Adamant nature to maximize its power, but a Jolly nature can be run to pivot against Excadrill more easily; however, it doesn't have many uses aside from that. Despite having Tinted Lens and a solid offensive typing, many physical walls like Skarmory, Clefable, and Mega Venusaur can still easily halt Lokix's progress, so strong special attackers such as Victini, Alakazam, and Iron Moth can easily serve to deal with them. Other Pokemon that 4x resist Lokix's moves like Iron Moth can still be a chore for Lokix to face, since they can switch in on its Bug-type moves and immediately threaten Lokix and its team with their high-powered attacks. To rectify this, partnering Lokix with threats such as Iron Boulder is necessary to properly deal with with those respective foes.

With its STAB combination, it is able to consistently threaten out common Steel- and Fairy-type defensive staples, such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Clefable, while hitting nearly the entire tier for neutral damage. With longevity through Morning Sun and Toxic immunity combined, it can perform this role through longer games while allowing it to break past checks that could otherwise outlast it, such as Chansey. To enhance this threat, Fiery Dance allows Iron Moth to boost its Special Attack without having to spend a turn setting up, allowing it to overwhelm potential answers like Mega Venusaur and Hippowdon. U-turn allows it to chip down and maintain momentum against Tyranitar, Ting-Lu, and Mega Latias. Alternatively, Energy Ball can be used to remove Ground-type foes, including Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon. Iron Moth is also adept at setting Toxic Spikes, as it is able to threaten out Amoonguss and deny entry to Mega Venusaur that would otherwise absorb the entry hazard. However, Iron Moth can often struggle to break past Ground-type foes, such as Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, as well as Dragon-type foes, such as Mega Latias. Additionally, it can also be beaten by Unaware users not weak to its coverage, namely Skeledirge. Because of this, it appreciates being paired with Fighting-type partners, like Buzzwole and Mienshao, that can force out these foes or threaten them with Knock Off to remove essential items such as Hippowdon's Leftovers and Skeledirge's Heavy-Duty Boots. In return, Iron Moth aids these partners by removing Steel-types that are not hit super effectively by Fighting-type coverage, such as Skarmory and Aegislash, as well as Fairy-types that would threaten these partners, like Mega Gardevoir and Clefable. Additionally, it enjoys partners such as Celesteela and Rotom-W that can easily switch in on Ground-type foes, such as Ting-Lu and Gastrodon, as well as partners capable of setting entry hazards to wear down these checks, such as Ting-Lu. It also appreciates partners capable of beating opposing Dragon-types, such as Scizor and Clefable. To handle offensive checks like Iron Boulder and Zeraora that would prevent Iron Moth from sweeping a weakened team, it appreciates being paired with speed control partners, including Choice Scarf Rotom-W and Shadow Sneak Aegislash. These allies can eliminate the aforementioned threats once Iron Moth has broken past their defensive counterplay.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu's high bulk, further boosted by Vessel of Ruin, and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock make it an elite entry hazard setter and tank in National Dex UU. Ruination reduces Ting-Lu's passivity, notably letting it wear down otherwise sturdy switch-ins such as Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur. Ruination can also pop Air Balloon held by foes such as Aegislash, letting Ting-Lu beat them one-on-one. Running both Spikes and Stealth Rock is an option on more offensive teams, letting Ting-Lu maximize its hazard-setting prowess, but it loses out on valuable utility by doing so. Rest lets Ting-Lu more consistently wall foes such as Iron Moth long-term, though while it's asleep Ting-Lu is very vulnerable to wallbreakers and setup sweepers. Alongside letting Ting-Lu damage foes using the hazards it set up, Whirlwind lets Ting-Lu phaze setup sweepers such as Sinistcha and Celesteela. It also prevents Ting-Lu from being setup fodder to foes resistant or immune to Ground such as the aforementioned two, something especially problematic if Ting-Lu isn't running Ruination. Leftovers slightly makes up for Ting-Lu's lack of reliable recovery, though Heavy-Duty Boots can be run instead to mitigate its vulnerability to entry hazards. Ting-Lu best fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a potent hazard setter and tank capable of checking dangerous threats such as Iron Moth and Mega Latias. These traits are appreciated by defensive and offensive Pokemon alike, such as Mega Venusaur and Iron Moth. Teams focused on hazard stacking can add another teammate such as Skarmory to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes so Ting-Lu doesn't have to run both. Offensive pivoting cores such as Iron Moth + Rotom-W can rapidly wear down Ting-Lu while preventing it from fulfilling its defensive roles effectively. Knock Off users such as Clefable and Scizor can lure in and remove these pivot's Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers, leaving them more vulnerable to Ting-Lu's entry hazards. Despite its great bulk, Ting-Lu has a plethora of weaknesses that let foes with super effective moves such as Clefable and Hydrapple have an easy time breaking through it, making checks to them such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela good partners. While it's favored to win against many foes one-on-one, some foes such as Iron Boulder have the coverage to take out Ting-Lu if it has taken a moderate amount of damage beforehand. Defoggers such as Rotom-W can ensure entry hazards don't cut into Ting-Lu's bulk if it isn't holding Heavy-Duty Boots, and the aforementioned bulky teammates such as Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can prevent Ting-Lu from being spread too thin checking foes.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Leaves is a dangerous wallbreaker and setup sweeper thanks to Booster Energy, Swords Dance, and its ability to threaten common defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Gastrodon. With Booster Energy, Iron Leaves is able to outspeed and threaten common Speed control options such as Zeraora and Iron Boulder. However, Iron Leaves's relative frailty combined with its terrible defensive typing renders it prone to being revenge killed by threats such as Shadow Sneak Aegislash and Bullet Punch Scizor as well as common Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao. Wild Charge allows Iron Leaves to threaten Celesteela and Skarmory after a Swords Dance. Close Combat is an option to deal with Magnezone and Hydreigon while dealing as much damage to Scizor as possible. Lastly, Throat Chop can be used to hit Aegislash and Latias. The given EV spread ensures that Booster Energy provides Iron Leaves with a Speed boost. Iron Leaves fits on hyper offense teams as an early-game wallbreaker, though it can also fit as a sweeper once checks such as Skarmory and Aegislash are removed. One of the best qualities of Iron Leaves is its ability to threaten Water- and Ground-types, such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Hippowdon, that check hyper offense staples such as Iron Moth, Victini, and Celesteela. Depending on its coverage, Iron Leaves can severely chip threats such as Celesteela and Mega Latias and thus pave the way for these teammates to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Moth and Victini threaten the Steel types that check Iron Leaves such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor while Celesteela easily sets up on them. Enamorus and Keldeo appreciate Iron Leaves dealing with Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur, and they, in return, deal with threats such as Bisharp and Skeledirge. Alakazam can be considered due to its ability to threaten Mega Latias and Skarmory for Iron Leaves; however, Alakazam tends to make teams more vulnerable to Celesteela due to relying on Focus Blast to break past it. Aegislash greatly benefits from Iron Leaves's wallbreaking abilities and fits well on hyper offense teams as a spinblocker and wincon, making it an excellent teammate. Aegislash also provides useful secondary Speed control with Shadow Sneak, allowing it to revenge kill snowballing threats such as Iron Moth and Blacephalon. In return, Iron Leaves threatens Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon. Iron Boulder and Azumarill can pair well with Iron Leaves to overwhelm physical walls. Iron Boulder threatens Skeledirge and can overwhelm Hydrapple, Celesteela, and Skarmory with Iron Leaves, while Azumarill can help weaken Skarmory and Scizor. Suicide leads such as Excadrill, Kleavor, and Mew make excellent teammates, as their entry hazard support allows Iron Leaves to reach important damage thresholds such as OHKOing defensive Celesteela at +2 with Wild Charge. Sticky Web Ribombee is another lead that fits well as a teammate, as Sticky Web support allows Iron Leaves to outspeed and threaten Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao and Excadrill under sand.</p>"

Strength Sap is used to provide Sinistcha with a means of reliable recovery; it also cripples Pokemon such as Mienshao and Choice Band Iron Boulder, ensuring Sinistcha can defeat them one-on-one. Alternatively, Substitute allows Sinistcha to dodge status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Slowking while allowing it to set up in front of Blissey and Chansey. It also provides Sinistcha with extra security against offensive threats such as Bisharp and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, allowing it to potentially beat them through burns from Matcha Gotcha. Shadow Ball provides Sinistcha with a reliable secondary STAB move that consistently threatens the likes of Aegislash, Celesteela, and Iron Moth once boosted. 96 Speed EVs allow Sinistcha to outrun Adamant Azumarill. Sinistcha fits best on bulky offense and balance structures as a wincon that helps even out matchups against common defensive Pokemon that they would otherwise struggle to break through, such as Hippowdon and Amoonguss. Entry hazard setters like Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory are solid choices that can check and wear down certain Pokemon that Sinistcha struggles against, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Clefable is especially noticeable, as it can also use Knock Off to remove key items from targets such as defensive Celesteela, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Heavy-Duty Boots Iron Moth, making it easier for Sinistcha to break past them in the long run. On the other hand, wallbreakers such as mixed Aegislash, offensive Mega Latias, and Life Orb Mienshao are similarly efficacious teammates that can help open up opportunities for Sinistcha to sweep. Sinistcha values its longevity, thus preferring not to lose its Leftovers or be crippled by any form of residual damage before setting up. Therefore, defensive pivots such as Mold Breaker Excadrill, Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Scizor are all appreciated for their ability to assist in these areas; Excadrill and Rotom-W serve as effective hazard removal options, whereas Slowbro and Scizor can use Teleport and U-turn respectively to help Sinistcha enter the battlefield safely and absorb Knock Off from users such as Clefable and Mega Venusaur in the process.</p>"

      "Defensive Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>With a good typing that has a myriad of offensive and defensive applications, unique ability in Toxic Chain, and respectable stat spread, Okidogi is able to pose as a bulky setup sweeper that also retains a solid attacking presence. Offensively, Okidogi’s decent natural power, resistances, and good defenses mean it is effective at responding to common attackers that feature on more aggressive teams, such as Mienshao, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and mixed Aegislash. Defensively, Okidogi not only poses a significant sweeping threat to common physically defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole, which are either threatened by Okidogi’s STAB moves or unable to wear it down in return, but also can effectively break past checks such as Slowbro and Hippowdon in the long run with its ability to spread poison through Toxic Chain’s effect. Knock Off is most often used, as this allows Okidogi to remove crucial items from defensive Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it, such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Skeledirge and Slowbro, as well as Leftovers from Aegislash and Celesteela. However, Poison Jab can be used instead if the ability to immediately threaten Fairy-types such as Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Azumarill is more desirable; it also combines with Toxic Chain to better spread poison onto incoming switch-ins such as Mega Latias. Substitute is heavily preferred in the last moveslot to allow Okidogi to dodge debilitating status moves, notably Spore from Amoonguss and Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W and Mega Sableye, allowing Okidogi to set up on and break through those Pokemon with ease; it also protects Okidogi from dangerous revenge killers such as Alakazam and Mega Latias which may otherwise force Okidogi out. In conjunction with Black Sludge’s recovery, the given EV spread allows Okidogi to outpace Tyranitar, with the remaining EVs invested into its bulk and Attack to make Okidogi as threatening as possible, notably avoiding a 2HKO from Hydreigon’s Draco Meteor and Aegislash’s Shadow Ball. Okidogi fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate the defensive security it provides against threats such as Mienshao as well as its threatening offense. Other defensive Pokemon that Okidogi enjoys being paired with include Clefable, Slowking, Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Mold Breaker Excadrill, which can support Okidogi with entry hazard support, wearing down Pokemon such as Hydrapple and Tapu Fini in the process. Additionally, Clefable and Slowbro can also spread paralysis onto faster threats such as Iron Moth and Enamorus; Skarmory is also able to take advantage of the Ground-types that Okidogi tends to bring in, like Hippowdon and Gastrodon, to set Spikes; Rotom-W and Excadrill are able to remove potential hazards, which may incur chip damage. Additionally, early- and mid-game wallbreakers such as U-turn Iron Moth, Swords Dance Aegislash, and Iron Boulder are excellent at applying pressure to defensive Pokemon that may otherwise stop Okidogi from sweeping, such as Mega Latias, Tapu Fini, and Hippowdon, and they can also directly benefit from Okidogi’s ability to chip away at the likes of Celesteela and Tangrowth if needed. Lastly, Okidogi will often require faster teammates to avoid being overwhelmed by faster revenge killers such as Alakazam and Keldeo; examples of Pokemon that can succeed in deterring these attackers include Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf users such as Enamorus.</p>"

      "Offensive Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Okidogi’s good typing and immunity to Toxic lend it to being a solid offensive wallbreaker, notably allowing it to dominate common Fighting-type checks in Clefable, Amoonguss, and Slowking in this regard. Bulk Up’s Defense boost also benefits Okidogi offensively, letting it take attacks from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Buzzwole more easily in a pinch. Gunk Shot is preferred over Poison Jab due to its higher initial Base Power, notably allowing it to 2HKO Mega Venusaur at +1 and giving it significant odds to OHKO Clefable. Knock Off gives Okidogi crucial coverage against Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Skeledirge while also dealing respectable damage to common Psychic-type checks in Mega Latias and Slowbro, effectively wearing them down effectively in conjunction with Toxic Chain’s afflicted poison. Fightinium Z, in conjunction with Close Combat, gives Okidogi a way to plow through common physically defensive checks to it such as Hippowdon and Skarmory after a Bulk Up; All-Out Pummeling also OHKOes Ting-Lu from full health and has good odds to do the same to specially defensive Celesteela after some chip damage. 180 Speed EVs ensure Okidogi outpaces Aegislash and Magnezone with a Speed-boosting nature as well as Adamant Bisharp. Okidogi enjoys being paired with fast teammates that appreciate its ability to overwhelm common defensive Pokemon such as Clefable and Amoonguss. Teammates such as Zeraora, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Enamorus are each excellent offensive partners for Okidogi, providing it with crucial speed control against faster threats such as Alakazam and Keldeo as well as being able to further pressure Psychic-types such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, and Reuniclus. Additionally, these Pokemon also provide Okidogi with other forms of support; the former two supply it with safer opportunities to hit the field through momentum, allowing Okidogi to get in safely against Pokemon such as Clefable, Hydrapple, and Tapu Fini, while Choice Scarf Enamorus can use Healing Wish to offset any residual damage Okidogi might sustain early on. Besides this, other defensive partners such as Clefable, Slowking, and Tapu Fini are also excellent for their ability to absorb potential status conditions from Slowbro’s Scald and Blissey’s Thunder Wave that may deter Okidogi from wallbreaking. Lastly, Okidogi appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Ting-Lu, Excadrill, and Gastrodon, which can weaken Pokemon such as Celesteela into Okidogi’s KO threshold. Notably, Okidogi also offensively checks dangerous physical attackers such as Mienshao and Tyranitar, which may threaten them in return.</p>"

Its typing enables it to sit on defensive staples like Ting-Lu, Celesteela, and Rotom-W as well as offensive threats like Iron Boulder, Zeraora, and Aegislash. Draco Meteor is typically preferred alongside Dragonium Z to maximize Hydrapple's power, allowing it to break past defensive answers in Celesteela, Blissey, and Scizor at +4, but Fickle Beam can be used as a more accurate attack that lets Hydrapple retain its boosts after multiple uses. Leaf Storm allows Hydrapple to OHKO Keldeo and Iron Boulder unboosted and threaten Dragon-immune options like Enamorus and Mega Gardevoir. Recover bolsters Hydrapple's already impressive longevity, notably allowing it to more reliably defeat Celesteela and Scizor, but Earth Power is also a great option to decimate Iron Moth attempting to switch in and eliminate Aegislash and Magnezone more easily. While Dragonium Z is preferred to help Hydrapple heavily damage potential checks like Mega Venusaur on the switch in, Heavy-Duty Boots can be utilized on teams without entry hazard control options so Hydrapple can more reliably utilize Regenerator to remain healthy. Eject Pack is a niche option on offense teams that can maintain momentum, turning Hydrapple into an one-time offensive pivot. Hydrapple's EV spread allows it to outspeed and OHKO Magic Guard Clefable with Leaf Storm at +2 and survive a neutral Iron Moth Sludge Wave from full health while not being 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Mienshao's Close Combat. Thanks to its offensive prowess and defensive profile, Hydrapple can be used on nearly any team, helping offense teams shore up matchups against dangerous threats like Iron Boulder and Zeraora while helping defensive teams break through opposing defensive structures. While Hydrapple can take on nearly any threat from full health, options like Draco Meteor Mega Latias and Buginium Z Scizor threaten to KO it from high, if not full, health. Strong Steel-type teammates like Scizor, Celesteela, and Aegislash can help against these threats, and Hydrapple can work in tandem with them to wear down shared checks like Celesteela as well as handle threats like Zeraora, Rotom-W, and Ting-Lu that tend to switch in against them. Hydrapple also appreciates offensive pivots such as Mienshao and Iron Moth to bring it in against their defensive checks like Buzzwole and Ting-Lu; Hydrapple can handle these as well as faster threats like Iron Boulder and Zeraora for them. Magnezone is also a notable partner for Hydrapple; given that the two most reliable Hydrapple checks are Scizor and Celesteela, removing them can often allow Hydrapple to decimate the remainder of the opposing team. Hydrapple also covers Magnezone's Ground-type weakness, easily switching into Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, and Excadrill.</p>"

Swords Dance is mandatory for Iron Boulder to break past defensive options like Slowbro and Skarmory. Close Combat allows Iron Boulder to threaten Tyranitar and break past Ting-Lu at +2, which resists both of Iron Boulder's STAB moves. Zen Headbutt lets Iron Boulder immediately threaten Mega Venusaur, especially at +2, but Earthquake can be used instead to threaten Aegislash. Rockium Z allows Iron Boulder to secure OHKOs against the aforementioned Skarmory and Slowbro, as well as most other neutral targets, like Celesteela and Rotom-W, that would otherwise be able to stomach a +2 Mighty Cleave and threaten Iron Boulder in return. Psychium Z is an alternative, letting Iron Boulder OHKO Mega Venusaur without a Swords Dance boost and threaten certain Rock-resistant foes like Hippowdon, but is generally less consistent. Booster Energy is an option on hyper offensive teams, allowing Iron Boulder to outspeed all Choice Scarf users, at the cost of Iron Boulder's wallbreaking power provided by Z-Crystals. Swords Dance Iron Boulder is generally seen on teams that appreciate its natural Speed and can take advantage of Iron Boulder removing common defensive staples like Clefable and Slowbro. Teammates such as Mienshao and Scizor can take advantage of holes left in the opposing team to sweep and can also weaken these defensive Pokemon to allow Iron Boulder to sweep later. Iron Boulder also appreciates entry hazard support, as even at +2, it can fail to KO many defensive options without hazard damage, so hazard setters like Hippowdon and Excadrill are appreciated. Iron Boulder is also relatively frail, so it appreciates pivots such as Iron Moth and Mienshao that can give it entry against foes such as Skeledirge and Clefable. Given its poor defensive typing, Iron Boulder is also weak to revenge killers such as Scizor, Mega Aerodactyl, and Azumarill, so teammates that can take hits from these threats, such as Celesteela and Mega Venusaur, are good teammates.</p>"

The ability to run all of Close Combat, Earthquake, and Zen Headbutt allows Iron Boulder to threaten Ting Lu, Aegislash, and Mega Venusaur at the same time. Choice Band Iron Boulder can 2HKO all of these threats, as well as immediately threatening Mega Latias and Tapu Fini with 2HKOs. Given its phenomenal Speed and instant power, Choice Band Iron Boulder can fit on most teamstyles that can provide it with safe entry. Defensive pivots like Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Clefable can provide it with a solid defensive backbone into options like Azumarill and Mega Aerodactyl that can threaten Iron Boulder while also providing entry points against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela. Alternatively, offensive pivots like Greninja and Iron Moth can take advantage of the defensive options that Iron Boulder lures in, such as Hippowdon and Quagsire, as well as the holes it can leave in an opposing team. In return, they provide entry points against foes like Skeledirge and Tyranitar. Despite Iron Boulder's power, it can fail to 2HKO certain defensive options, such as Skarmory, Quagsire, and Hippowdon. Therefore, entry hazard support from Clefable and Ting Lu is appreciated. Teammates that can break through these physical walls, such as Iron Moth and Hydrapple, are also good partners.</p>"

Malignant Chain is not only a strong STAB attack that easily breaks through common defensive staples in Clefable and Hydrapple but also comes with the ability to disrupt common checks to it in Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, and Tyranitar via its poison chance while simultaneously confusing them thanks to its ability and letting Pecharunt beat them in the long run. Shadow Ball allows Pecharunt to break through Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Skeledirge; combined with Ghostium Z, Pecharunt also threatens to deal massive damage to defensive staples such as Celesteela, Excadrill, and Mega Venusaur after a Nasty Plot. Alternatively, Hex lets Pecharunt threaten the likes of Hippowdon and Mega Latias more reliably without having to deplete its Z-Move against them, although its lack of initial power means it is more reliant on said targets being afflicted by Maligant Chain or statused by its teammates beforehand. Recover is used in the last slot to leverage Pecharunt's defensive capabilities to facilitate additional setup opportunities; notably, Pecharunt's bulk and typing also make it one of the best checks to Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Hawlucha, and Buzzwole. Besides the extra power on its Ghost-type moves granted by Ghostium Z, Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative option to ensure Pecharunt isn't worn down by entry hazards when attempting to absorb attacks from Pokemon such as Mienshao. Certain defensive pivots such as Slowking and Scizor can provide Pecharunt with safe switch-in opportunities against Pokemon that it forces out such as Tangrowth and Skarmory. Additionally, these Pokemon also answer potential revenge killers such as Alakazam and Iron Boulder, and they provide Pecharunt with a safety net versus defensive checks like Ting-Lu and Hippowdon, as it often relies on poison chances to beat them as opposed to direct damage. Entry hazards from the likes of Clefable, Skarmory, and Gastrodon can help supplement Pecharunt's offensive capabilities; Pecharunt supports these Pokemon by taking advantage of defensive pieces such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss often used against them. Lastly, teammates such as Zeraora, Iron Moth, and Zygarde-10% can form a synergistic offensive combination with Pecharunt, overwhelming shared checks like Ting-Lu more easily. In return, they appreciate Pecharunt's defensive capabilities against revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Mienshao.</p>"
