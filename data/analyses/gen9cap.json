    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor may find it worth forgoing Earthquake in favor of both Facade and Knock Off on the same set. Doing so allows it to threaten all of Venomicon, Air Balloon Gholdengo, Arghonaut, and Equilibra while retaining Facade's consistency. While dropping Gliscor's only STAB option makes it less immediately threatening towards Galarian Slowking, Chuggalong and Garganacl, it results in a set that combines both the progress making of Knock Off with Facade's ability to hit most targets neutrally regardless of their Tera type, making it a valid alternative as a late-game sweeper. Both Gliscor sets may find it beneficial to run Tera Dragon in order to patch up a team defensively against Ogerpon-W. While not as all-encompassing as Tera Water—notably worsening Gliscor's ability to deal with Hemogoblin and Chuggalong—Tera Dragon ensures Gliscor can safely punish Ogerpon-W with Toxic or Facade without risking a 2HKO from Power Whip or Ivy Cudgel. Entry hazard setter Gliscor has the option of running Poison Jab as its main attacking move to benefit stall teams. This allows Gliscor to punish Hatterene in order to set Spikes while also letting it directly threaten Ogerpon-W and fish for poison throughout a game. Poison Jab is almost exclusively run with Knock Off, due to the former compressing the damage and utility of Gliscor's usual Earthquake + Toxic combination. Another unique benefit is Poison Jab's greater PP count compared to Earthquake and Toxic, allowing it to outlast opposing Gliscor in the event of a PP stall war. Taunt is a flexible option for Gliscor on stall teams that allows Gliscor to deny hazards from opposing Arghonaut, Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu, prevent pivoting attempts from Galarian Slowking and Malaconda, and stop Alomomola, Clefable, Venomicon, and others from using their healing moves. While it comes with the opportunity cost of losing Knock Off or Toxic, it can serve as a potent means of denying progress from slower balance teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Even with full special defense investment, Gliscor is unable to stay in versus many of the tier's wallbreakers, including Darkrai, Deoxys-S, Primarina, Walking Wake, and Kyurem.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: While Gliscor threatens progress on most Pokemon with its combination of Toxic and Earthquake, many setup sweepers are able to circumvent Gliscor's options by way of their typing, Tera, or item choice. Air Balloon Gholdengo, Taunt Roaring Moon, Cawmodore, and Nasty Plot Venomicon all have the ability to use Gliscor as setup fodder, among others.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Some Pokemon that could be threatened or walled by Gliscor in theory, such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Meowscarada, commonly run coverage to target Gliscor's Ice weakness.</p> <p><strong>Miasmaw</strong>: Miasmaw is a major annoyance for Gliscor, as Neutralizing Gas shuts off Poison Heal and causes Gliscor to take massive poison damage, which usually forces it out. However, Miasmaw cannot consistently switch in on Gliscor due to its physical frailty and hazard weakness.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Gliscor</strong>: Swords Dance Gliscor is able to use opposing hazard setter Gliscor as setup fodder. Additionally, two hazard setter Gliscor facing off often results in a stalemate, where neither is encouraged to switch out and three layers of spikes are set on each side of the field. This can result in a PP stall war between the two Gliscor, resulting in the loss of one Gliscor and the other's resources being greatly limited.</p>",

      "Defensive Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Due to its unmatched longevity and myriad utility options, Gliscor establishes itself as one of the most effective hazard setters in the format. Its ability to outlast common defensive Pokemon like Arghonaut and Venomicon and threaten the likes of Galarian Slowking and Garganacl grants Gliscor numerous opportunities to set hazards throughout a game. Spikes is the primary hazard of choice, leveraging Gliscor's ability to generate free turns in order to set more layers of Spikes. Gliscor may choose to run Stealth Rock instead, either when paired with a Spikes setter or with U-turn for a less passive set overall. Toxic allows Gliscor to threaten Pokemon by putting them on a timer, such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Cresceidon, Arghonaut, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-W. This synergizes with Protect, allowing Gliscor to force chip damage on poisoned targets that threaten it out. Note that Gliscor sets running Toxic may find themselves walled and taken advantage of by Pokemon like Equilibra, Venomicon, and Air Balloon Gholdengo. For this reason, Gliscor may run Knock Off or U-turn in order to make progress or regain momentum in these matchups. Gliscor lacking Toxic, however, are unable to effectively threaten bulky setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Dragonite, and Revenankh. Protect is mandatory on every Gliscor set, enabling its longevity by giving it a free turn to recover with Poison Heal and having the benefit of scouting the opponent for coverage that may threaten it. A specially defensive spread grants Gliscor the ability to check special attackers like Raging Bolt, Iron Moth, Iron Crown, and Dragapult while retaining a positive matchup versus physical attackers like Hemogoblin, Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Kingambit by virtue of its typing. A physically defensive spread grants Gliscor more consistency against the physical threats it seeks to punish and notably lets it spread Toxic in the face of poor matchups like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Ogerpon-W. Water is Gliscor's primary choice of Tera type on specially defensive sets, granting it improved matchups versus Darkrai, Deoxys-S, Cresceidon, Chuggalong, Walking Wake, and Gholdengo. Tera Ghost can be used on physically defensive sets in order to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, at the cost of worsening matchups against the likes of Roaring Moon, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. The given physically defensive spread with 16 Special Defense EVs allows Gliscor to take a Life Orb-boosted Psycho Boost from Deoxys-S and a +1 Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt from full health. It's specially defensive EV spread with 36 Defense EVs allows Gliscor to survive Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-W from full health, and both spreads run 244 HP EVs to maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal.</p> <p>Gliscor can fit on any team style bar hyper offense, but it thrives the most on balance teams that appreciate its ability to soak up hits, set entry hazards, and spread Toxic or Knock Off to whittle down the opposing team. Teams will often partition Spikes and Stealth Rock between Gliscor and another Pokemon, like Stealth Rock on Garganacl or Venomicon or Spikes on Arghonaut and Skarmory. Gliscor may appreciate a spinblocker to secure hazards, with partners like Kitsunoh and Air Balloon Gholdengo denying Rapid Spin from Equilibra or Great Tusk, respectively, and the latter blocking Defog attempts from Corviknight. Other forms of hazard removal, like Cinderace's Court Change and Rapid Spin from Mollux, are easily denied by Gliscor itself, forcing Terastallization from the latter. While it often runs Knock Off itself, teams using Gliscor often use Knock Off from Arghonaut, Weavile, or Roaring Moon to force hazard damage on resilient Heavy-Duty Boots users like Cresceidon and Venomicon. Gliscor is often unable to fully wall or punish wallbreakers on its own, and it appreciates the presence of bulky Water or Ice-resistant Pokemon like Arghonaut, Mollux, and Cresceidon to form a defensive core. Pokemon that are heavily reliant on their items to function, such as Krilowatt, Cresceidon, and Mollux, heavily appreciate Gliscor’s ability to act as a consistent switch-in to Knock Off.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor sets itself apart from other sweepers like Kingambit and Zamazenta with its utility over the course of a game and ability to threaten a sweep multiple times. With its superb defensive profile, Swords Dance Gliscor is able to take advantage of lower-paced teams giving it setup opportunities and trade positively into offensive structures. Being able to set up Swords Dance without risk in the face of opposing Gliscor, Venomicon, Garganacl, Mollux, Clefable, and Alomomola, among others, allows it to punish passive play and break through defensive cores with its near-unresisted coverage. Knock Off is the secondary move of choice for Gliscor, as it allows Gliscor to make progress against Arghonaut and Cresceidon, more easily pressure Equilibra, and break through Air Balloon Gholdengo. Facade is an equally potent choice, allowing Gliscor to break through Venomicon and opposing Gliscor with greater ease, and provide strong neutral coverage as a mid-ground to hit most Tera types seeking to avoid Earthquake, like Tera Grass Iron Moth and Tera Flying Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Chuggalong, and Mollux. Protect is mandatory, as it grants Gliscor a free turn to activate Poison Heal and the ability to safely recover throughout a game. Water is Gliscor's most effective Tera type, flipping its weaknesses to Water and Ice and letting it take most hits neutrally while leveraging its good bulk. Tera Normal is a valid option for sets running Facade, greatly boosting Gliscor's wallbreaking capabilities and removing both of its weaknesses. A specially defensive spread grants Gliscor more opportunities to set up throughout a game and limits the amount of Pokemon that force it out, but a physically defensive spread allows Gliscor to more comfortably take on physical sweepers like Kingambit, Bulk Up Revenankh, and Hemogoblin. The given physically defensive spread with 16 Special Defense EVs allows Gliscor to take a Life Orb-boosted Psycho Boost from Deoxys-S and a +1 Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt from full health. Its specially defensive EV spread with 36 Defense EVs allows Gliscor to tank Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-W from full health, and both spreads run 244 HP EVs to maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal.</p> <p>Balanced, bulky offense, and even stall teams seeking a bulky late-game sweeper appreciate Swords Dance Gliscor. While it lacks the utility of its Spikes set, Swords Dance Gliscor remains an incredible asset for defensively oriented teams that need a way of breaking down opposing defensive teams. Gliscor pairs well with teammates that can stack hazards and spread Knock Off throughout a game and check the Pokemon that commonly force it out. Arghonaut is an obvious choice for this role, as it covers Gliscor's poor matchups into Weavile, Equilibra, Darkrai, and Hisuian Samurott, but other hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Venomicon, and Clefable are viable companions. Swords Dance Gliscor has a tendency to be forced out by Encore users like Cresceidon and Iron Valiant, so teammates like Mollux, Ogerpon-W, and Gholdengo serve well to punish those particular matchups. Gliscor appreciates offensive teammates to help break down its checks, such as Kyurem, Darkrai, Iron Crown, and Raging Bolt targeting Pokemon such as Arghonaut, Skarmory, and Great Tusk. Much like its hazard setter set, Gliscor provides a reliable absorber of Knock Off to benefit item-reliant teammates like Cresceidon, Galarian Slowking, Moltres, and Mollux. Additionally, Swords Dance Gliscor plays an important role on stall teams, spreading Knock Off and exerting offensive pressure on Pokemon with great longevity, such as Alomomola, Garganacl, Clefable, and opposing Gliscor, which are otherwise difficult for stall teams to remove. Pairing Gliscor with an Ogerpon-W check such as Hydrapple, Sinistcha, or Amoonguss forms a potent core, which should be used alongside stall staples like Dondozo, Blissey, Alomomola, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Clodsire.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "comments": "<h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Astrolotl and Ceruledge</strong>: Specially defensive Astrolotl is Iron Moth's most common counter, stomaching even its sun-boosted Choice Specs Tera Fire Overheat and threatening to KO it back with Stomping Tantrum. In combination with a Poison-resistant Pokemon like Venomicon, Iron Moth can cede crucial momentum, providing the opponent with an opportunity for a comeback. Flash Fire Ceruledge is Iron Moth's hardest counter, being immune to Overheat and Fiery Dance,  resistant to Solar Beam and Sludge Wave, and able to strike back with a boosted Shadow Sneak. However, Iron Moth can run Tera Ground + Tera Blast specifically to circumvent these counters.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock wears down Iron Moth exceptionally quickly. This is particularly notable with its Choice Specs set, which needs to switch out often to reset Overheat's Special Attack drops.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Sucker Punch Kingambit and Extreme Speed Dragonite can prey on Iron Moth's weak physical defense. Kingambit must be wary of Tera Fairy Iron Moth, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Roaring Moon, Cinderace, Meowscarada, Greninja, and Psyshock Iron Valiant can pick off Iron Moth before it can respond.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Clodsire, Skeledirge, Arghonaut, and Ting-Lu can easily tank most moves from Booster Energy Iron Moth, but they are 2HKOed by its sun-boosted Choice Specs Overheat with any prior damage or if it Terastallizes.</p> <p><strong>Rain Teams</strong>: Pelipper can override Jumbao's sun with rain, which weakens Iron Moth's best attacks. Floatzel and Quaquaval hit Iron Moth's weak physical defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Details</h5> <p>Choice Specs Iron Moth is the strongest wallbreaker available for sun teams. Its Tera Fire Overheat under sun can 2HKO Arghonaut and Skeledirge, two of the best special walls in the metagame, and still deal massive damage to frailer targets at -2. Solar Beam more reliably 2HKOes Arghonaut, Toxapex, and Garganacl so that Iron Moth isn't required to Terastallize to be effective. Fiery Dance lets Iron Moth snowball and end games once the opposing team has no remaining Unaware users and is sufficiently weakened. Sludge Wave 2HKOes Astrolotl and Dragonite and OHKOes Cinderace outside of sun, which could otherwise tank an Overheat and pivot around the weakened hit. Ground-type Tera Blast OHKOes Ceruledge, Astrolotl, Skeledirge, and opposing Iron Moth with a surprise hit.</p> <p>Drought Jumbao is a required teammate to set up sun. Healing Wish can help Iron Moth offset Stealth Rock damage and get into battle late-game. Other Protosynthesis users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk fit fantastically alongside Iron Moth. Roaring Moon's Choice Band-boosted attacks complement Iron Moth's strong special attacks, and its U-turn can bring Iron Moth in safely against a Fairy- or Steel-type switch-in. Great Tusk can remove entry hazards and switch into strong physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. In return, Iron Moth very easily switches into Jumbao, one of Great Tusk's hard counters. Eject Button Hatterene is a fantastic teammate that helps keep Stealth Rock off the field and give Iron Moth a crucial free switch.</p>"
      },
      "Booster Energy": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Details</h5> <p>Booster Energy Iron Moth fits best on hyper offense teams where Booster Energy's one-time use can be easily justified. Although it faces some competition  from Quiver Dance Volcarona, its instant power and higher natural Speed tier gives it a niche over Volcarona. Fiery Dance allows Iron Moth to snowball quickly, while Sludge Wave forces Arghonaut and Garganacl to think twice before Terastallizing into a Fairy-type. Energy Ball 2HKOes Arghonaut, Krilowatt, and Garganacl, but Psychic maintains coverage against Arghonaut while pressuring Venomicon, Dragapult, and Clodsire harder. Ground-type Tera Blast allows Iron Moth to push past Skeledirge, Astrolotl, Clodsire, and Ceruledge, which would otherwise give it serious trouble. Dazzling Gleam is best when Iron Moth is Tera Fairy, hitting Roaring Moon and Dragapult more effectively. Tera Fairy allows Iron Moth to stomach Roaring Moon's STAB moves and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, removing them for a surprise KO. Agility helps Iron Moth sweep better, but it displaces a coverage move and is generally outclassed by Volcarona as a setup sweeper. Tera Grass is the best option, turning Iron Moth's severe Ground weakness into a resistance and boosting Energy Ball. An EV spread of 124 Def / 132 SpA / 252 Spe can be used so that Booster Energy raises Iron Moth's Speed, but the drop in power is noticeable. Booster Energy Iron Moth can also fit on sun teams to thwart typical counterplay to its Choice Specs set. Solar Beam should be run to OHKO specially defensive Garganacl at +1 and with Quark Drive active. However, Choice Specs is usually more effective against unprepared teams.</p> <p>Iron Moth fits excellently on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Garchomp enable Iron Moth to net KOs more easily. Rapid Spin users like Caribolt and Great Tusk remove Stealth Rock to help Iron Moth leverage its good special bulk. Other hyper offense sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, Swords Dance Iron Valiant, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Scale Shot + Swords Dance Miasmaw tend to struggle with Jumbao, which Iron Moth can help deal with. Supreme Overlord Kingambit can clean up games after Iron Moth has broken holes and fainted.</p>"

  "Roaring Moon": {
    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Cresceidon serves as a major annoyance for Roaring Moon, as it can take most of what Roaring Moon can throw at it and either OHKO it with Moonblast or cripple it with Thunder Wave in return. However, Cresceidon is unable to reliably deal with Dragon Dance sets should Multiscale be broken, as it risks getting OHKOed by +1 Tera Flying Acrobatics. Similarly, Clefable can switch in and OHKO with Moonblast or cripple it with Thunder Wave and, in the case of Dragon Dance sets, Sticky Barb, but it risks getting 2HKOed by Acrobatics from Dragon Dance sets and Iron Head from Choice Band sets. Hemogoblin greatly threatens Roaring Moon with Pixilate Extreme Speed, but should Roaring Moon be sufficiently healthy, it can play around this with Terastallization.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with a great deal of physical bulk, such as Dondozo and Skarmory, are near insurmountable obstacles for most Roaring Moon sets, as they take little damage from anything Roaring Moon has to throw at them, and in return, they can deal a ton of damage with Body Press or, in the case of the latter, force it out with Whirlwind. However, should Roaring Moon carry Taunt, it can very easily turn the tables on these threats.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Arghonaut can often force out Roaring Moon with Circle Throw thanks to its ability to survive Acrobatics and avoid taking too much damage from what Choice Band sets have to throw at it. However, should Dragon Dance Roaring Moon Terastallize into a Flying-type, it has a chance to OHKO Arghonaut with Acrobatics, and Arghonaut cannot switch in on Outrage from Choice Band sets. Zamazenta can deal major damage to Roaring Moon with Body Press or Close Combat, or it can force it out with Roar, but it often requires the aid of Terastallization to deal with Dragon Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Roaring Moon’s low physical bulk leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by common priority users such as Hemogoblin, Dragonite, and Revenankh.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is one of the premier physical sweepers in the CAP metagame, owing its success to its great offensive typing, sky-high Attack, blistering Speed, decent bulk, and a unique coverage profile that allows it to hit most of the metagame neutrally. Furthermore, Roaring Moon also acts as a consistent form of item removal thanks to its access to Knock Off, greatly increasing its ability to pressure its checks and provide support for its teammates. Acrobatics serves as Roaring Moon’s main coverage option, allowing it to break through bulky Fighting-types, such as Arghoanut, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. Earthquake is the preferred choice for the last moveslot, as it allows Roaring Moon to deal with Raging Bolt and Kingambit. Alternatively, Roaring Moon can run Taunt to greatly improve its matchup against bulkier teams. Booster Energy gives a much-appreciated boost to Roaring Moon’s Attack and synergizes nicely with Acrobatics. Tera Flying is recommended to boost the power of Acrobatics, patch up its weakness to Fighting, and give it opportunities to set up on Ground-types such as Equilibra, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Tera Steel can be used to improve Roaring Moon's matchup against Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin and Cresceidon. An EV spread of 220 Atk / 36 Def / 252 Spe can be run to boost Roaring Moon's Speed instead of its Attack. This makes Roaring Moon nearly impossible to outspeed and allows it to act as an emergency check for other sweepers, but the significant power loss means that Roaring Moon will often miss out on crucial KOs, most notably missing out on a chance to OHKO Arghonaut with Acrobatics after Terastallizing.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon generally finds itself on hyper offense teams. Roaring Moon struggles greatly with Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin, Cresceidon, Iron Valiant, and Clefable, so Poison- and Steel-types such as Iron Moth and Gholdengo are oftentimes mandatory teammates. Chuggalong is particularly notable in this regard, as it can take advantage of priority users that offensive teams often rely upon to check Roaring Moon, notably Hemogoblin. Physically bulky Pokemon, such as Skarmory and Dondozo, often serve as roadblocks for Roaring Moon, so it greatly appreciates being paired alongside special wallbreakers that can dispatch these threats, such as Raging Bolt and Darkrai. In return, Roaring Moon can easily deal with many of the special walls that they are unable to break through. Offensive Psychic- and Fairy-types such as Deoxys-S, Iron Crown, Hemogoblin, and Iron Valiant make for good partners for Roaring Moon thanks to their ability to reliably dispatch bulky Fighting-types such as Arghonaut and Zamazenta. Other strong physical sweepers such as Dragonite, Miasmaw, and Kingambit work wonders when paired with Roaring Moon, as together, they can apply very consistent pressure on their shared checks. Finally, Roaring Moon gets a lot of value from Spikes to wear down physical walls, so it appreciates being paired with Spikes setters such as Hisuian Samurott, Glimmora, and Deoxys-S.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band Roaring Moon is one of the strongest and most reliable sun attackers in the CAP metagame, serving as a powerful physical wallbreaker and offensive pivot for these teams. Knock Off serves as Roaring Moon’s primary attack, being extremely spammable thanks to its high power and lack of Dark-resistant Pokemon while also doubling as a progress-making tool. Outrage allows Roaring Moon to 2HKO Arghoanut and quickly finish off weakened teams after any opposing Fairy-types have been disposed of. Earthquake acts as the main coverage move of choice, allowing Roaring Moon to break past bulky Fire-types and Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Hemogoblin. Alternatively, Iron Head can be used instead to deal more damage against Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tera Fairy Garganacl. U-turn allows Roaring Moon to act as a fast pivot that can generate momentum for its team while also dealing significant damage to opposing Roaring Moon. Tera Dark is generally recommended to ensure that Knock Off is as strong as possible and improve its matchup against Dragapult. Alternatively, Roaring Moon can instead choose to run Tera Steel to patch up its weakness to Fairy and increase the power of Iron Head, greatly improving its matchup against Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin, Crecesidon, and Clefable. Roaring Moon generally prefers to run an EV spread of 220 Atk / 36 Def / 252 Spe to ensure that Protosynthesis boosts its Speed, with the rest going into Defense to minimize its priority weakness. Alternatively, Roaring Moon can instead choose to maximize its Attack with a spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe, making it so that Protosynthesis grants it an Attack boost and makes it even harder to wall. However, the boost from Choice Band is usually good enough on its own for Roaring Moon to do its job as a wallbreaker, and not having the Speed boost makes it a much worse revenge killer and worsens its matchup against opposing sun teams.</p> <p>Choice Band Roaring Moon makes itself at home on sun teams. On these teams, Malaconda is a mandatory teammate, as not only does it set sun for Roaring Moon, but it can also switch Roaring Moon in safely and provide paralysis support to allow it to outspeed foes outside of sun. Walking Wake is another notable teammate for Roaring Moon, as the two form an incredibly strong wallbreaking core thanks to their ability to quickly wear down each other's checks while also doing incredibly well against offensive teams thanks to having their Speed boosted under sun. Roaring Moon often struggles to deal with bulky Fairy-types such as Cresceidon and Clefable, so it greatly appreciates being paired with Fire- and Poison-types such as Heatran, Cinderace, Iron Moth, Venomicon, and Pecharunt that can deal with these threats for it. Finally, Roaring Moon often finds itself switching quite a bit, so it is worn down rather quickly by entry hazards. As such, it greatly appreciates being paired with hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk and Hatterene.</p>"

However, Life Orb chip damage makes revenge killing Stratagem easier. Stealth Rock can be run on such a set to give Stratagem some utility, and it often can place entry hazards with the switches it forces. However, Stratagem can struggle to wallbreak without a setup move. Calm Mind is also an option to let Stratagem quickly end games when given a setup opportunity, but Calm Mind is harder to set up with than Meteor Beam due to Stratagem's frailty. Earth Power can be used to OHKO Glimmora and Heatran at the cost of either valuable coverage or a setup move, weakening its ability to wallbreak past a large amount of the metagame.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Foes</strong>: Stratagem struggles to beat special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Cresceidon, Ting-Lu, and Equilibra. The former two can cripple it with Thunder Wave, Ting-Lu is able to remove the +1 boost with Whirlwind, and Equilibra can OHKO Stratagem with Flash Cannon.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Meteor Beam Stratagem is a terrifying wallbreaker due to its blazing Speed stat, great coverage options, and excellence at breaking holes through walls such as Equilibra and Ting-Lu. It can also serve as an excellent wincon once checks such as Galarian Slowking and Arghonaut have been weakened. Due to its frailty, Stratagem usually needs to come in on a free switch such as when an ally is KOed, although it is able to switch into Landorus-T and Mollux relatively safely. Energy Ball provides coverage against Arghonaut, Cresceidon, and Ting-Lu, although Stratagem is not guaranteed to OHKO these foes. Fire Blast is essential coverage, allowing Stratagem to deal large amounts of damage to the Steel-types that would otherwise wall it such as Equilibra and Gholdengo. Tera Fire strengthens Fire Blast and allows Stratagem to beat Equilibra and Heatran consistently thanks to Levitate while also OHKOing offensive Gholdengo. It also allows Stratagem to resist Pixilate Extreme Speed from Hemogoblin and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, making it harder to revenge kill. Tera Grass allows Stratagem to 2HKO Arghonaut and Ting-Lu at +1 while also OHKOing Cresceidon at +1 if Multiscale is broken prior.</p> <p>Stratagem fits best on hyper offense teams and can serve different uses depending on the matchup. Against balance structures, Stratagem serves as an excellent wallbreaker and paves the way for teammates such as Chuggalong and Iron Moth to sweep. Against hyper offense teams, Stratagem can easily be a late-game wincon, since it is hard to revenge kill once Booster Energy has been expended from threats such as Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. Entry hazard leads such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S make excellent teammates for it. Glimmora's Toxic Spikes support annoys walls such as Arghonaut and Ting-Lu, while Deoxys-S has an offensive presence with Psycho Boost. In return, Stratagem is able to offensively pressure hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Mollux, although it cannot prevent Equilibra from removing hazards. Deoxys-S can use a Life Orb and pair excellently with Stratagem by cleaning teams after it wallbreaks. Stratagem cannot easily beat special walls such as Equilibra, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking, so Pokemon that can easily defeat these threats such as Great Tusk, Ogerpon-W, and Miasmaw make excellent teammates. Chuggalong can switch into priority for Stratagem, having an especially great matchup against Rillaboom. Iron Moth can also fill a similar role as Chuggalong for Stratagem, but while it lacks the ability to deal with priority, it applies more immediate pressure. Both Chuggalong and Iron Moth appreciate Stratagem's ability to switch into Ground-type moves for them and weaken their checks such as Equilibra, Arghonaut, and Ting-Lu.</p>"

Ice Punch can be run to hit Gliscor and Landorus-T, but the utility of Arghonaut's other moves makes it niche at best. Toxic can be used over Spikes if there's another setter on the team, but Venomicon remains a hard counter. Tera Poison is an option that allows Arghonaut to be immune to Toxic and resist Fairy, but keeping the Psychic weakness and obtaining a Ground weakness is not worth it. Finally, Covert Cloak allows Arghonaut to best Garganacl and become a more consistent switch-in to Heatran, Mollux, and Pecharunt, but provides very little otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Offensive Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin, Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus all threaten Arghonaut and have ways to deal with it even if it Terrastalizes. Defensive Fairy-types like Clefable and Cresceidon both can similarly force it out. Only Iron Valiant and Clefable want to switch into Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Venomicon, Zapdos, Gliscor, and Tomohawk can all shrug off Arghonaut's attacks and threaten it with either a strong STAB move or their utility options. The former two do not appreciate losing their item and so can't mindlessly switch in, and Gliscor's Poison Heal must be activated before it can switch in freely. Skarmory can't immediately threaten Arghonaut but can phaze Arghonaut out with Whirlwind. Venomicon-E threatens huge damage even after Arghonaut Terastallizes. Tera Flying Acrobatics Roaring Moon similarly threatens to KO Arghonaut after minimal damage.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Krilowatt, Caribolt, Raging Bolt, and Plasmanta can all hit Arghonaut super effectively, with Plasmanta even being able to beat it after Terastallizing. However, Arghonaut can take the others on after it Terastallizes into the Fairy-type, and Krilowatt is scared of switching into Arghonaut, as it gets crippled by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada all threaten to OHKO Arghonaut and can pivot out with U-turn on a predicted Tera Fairy. They also all can remove Arghonaut's item with their own Knock Off, making it easier to pick off by their teammates. Serperior threatens huge damage with Leaf Storm despite Arghonaut's Unaware and can even paralyze it with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Gliscor, Snaelstrom, and Pecharunt can all badly poison Arghonaut, while Cresceidon, Gholdengo, and Zapdos can paralyze it through Thunder Wave or Static, making it significantly more passive. Similarly, Heatran, Rotom-W, Mollux, and Volcanion all threaten to burn it, making Arghonaut deal pitiful damage. All of the above also empower Hex users like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and the aforementioned Pecharunt.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Arghonaut is one of the best defensive pivots in CAP thanks to Unaware, strong defenses and a fantastic support movepool. Circle Throw phazes setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Volcarona, and Stratagem. It also forces out Equilibra, the tier's premier spinner, making it easier to stack layers of Spikes. Knock Off threatens the Ghost-types that try to switch into Circle Throw such as Dragapult and Gholdengo and puts pressure on foes that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots to switch into entry hazards such as Venomicon, Volcarona, and Dragonite. 248 HP and 224 Defense EVs with an Impish nature guarantee that Arghonaut survives +2 Miasmaw's five-hit Scale Shot and Kingambit's Tera Blast Fairy with five Supreme Overlord boosts. The remaining 36 EVs are put into Special Defense to better tank special attacks, allowing Arghonaut to survive Krilowatt's Surf and Thunderbolt combination, as well as avoiding being 2HKOed by its Tera Water-boosted Surf after Arghonaut has Terastallized. While Leftovers gives Arghonaut much-appreciated passive recovery, Heavy-Duty Boots can be run instead to ignore Spikes at the cost of being more reliant on Recover. Tera Fairy allows Arghonaut to completely change its defensive profile, letting it beat Hemogoblin, Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant while stopping Miasmaw's Scale Shot.</p> <p>Arghonaut fits best on balance and stall teams, checking most setup sweepers and gaining momentum through the combination of Circle Throw and Spikes. Stealth Rock setters such as Clefable, Venomicon, and Heatran can aid in stacking hazards. Venomicon in particular is a great partner, taking defensive pressure off Arghonaut by checking Fairy-types like Hemogoblin and Iron Valiant as well as offensive Grass-types like Ogerpon-W and Meowscarada. Bulky Ground-types such as Equilibra, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor can help against offensive Electric-types such as Krilowatt, Caribolt, and Raging Bolt. The former two also help check opposing Psychic-types, while Gliscor can act as a solid Knock Off switch-in once its Poison Heal has activated. Equilibra can also remove hazards with Rapid Spin to keep Leftovers Arghonaut as healthy as possible. Offensive pivots such as Dragapult, Krilowatt, and Rillaboom appreciate the Spikes support and item removal that Arghonaut provides.</p>"

However, they don't like taking an Ice Beam on the switch in. Rillaboom and Malaconda also give Krilowatt trouble, as they can take an Ice Beam, then either OHKO with Grassy Glide or cripple it with Knock Off, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Galarian Slowking can easily take Krilowatt's attacks and can deal decent damage with Sludge Bomb, set up Future Sight, or pivot out with Chilly Reception. Equilibra and Ting-Lu can also be a problem because they are immune to Volt Switch and can respond with Earth Power and Earthquake, respectively, but they don't like switching into a Surf.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Terastallization</strong>: Krilowatt relies heavily on threatening super effective damage, so Terastallization that can remove foes' weaknesses, like Tera Dragon Cresceidon and Tera Grass Heatran, can suddenly catch Krilowatt off guard, making these foes harder to deal with.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Krilowatt functions as a good pivot with its good stats, great offensive typing, and exceptional ability in Magic Guard, which allows it to pivot constantly without fear of getting chipped down by entry hazards. Its STAB combination is also amazing in conjunction with Ice Beam, threatening a large portion of the metagame for super effective damage. Ice Beam covers Grass- and Dragon-types such as Caribolt, Rillaboom, Dragapult, Chuggalong, and Miasmaw. Tera Water sheds Krilowatt's weakness to Ground, allowing it to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu without getting OHKOed. Tera Flying flips its Ground and Grass matchups completely, which can catch Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Caribolt, and Rillaboom off guard.</p> <p>Krilowatt shines best on balance and bulky offense teams that can capitalize on it forcing out foes with its decent offensive presence and bringing in teammates safely using Volt Switch. Krilowatt should always be paired with a Knock Off absorber like Clefable or Gliscor, as most of its offensive presence is due to Life Orb, and both Clefable and Gliscor can provide entry hazards to chip down foes further. Gliscor specifically pairs well with Krilowatt, as it can help wear down Krilowatt's checks with Toxic. Pokemon that can set up Spikes, like the aforementioned Gliscor, Arghonaut, and Skarmory, are amazing teammates for Krilowatt, as its offensive coverage forces a lot of switching. Krilowatt pairs well with sweepers like Hemogoblin and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, as they take advantage of the free switch in  and chip damage that Krilowatt provides with Volt Switch, allowing them to break through their checks. Krilowatt is weak to Grass- and Ground-type attacks from foes like Meowscarada, Ogerpon-W, and Equilibra, so pairing it with Pokemon who can take on these threats such as Kyurem, Ogerpon-W, and Venomicon can really help keep Krilowatt healthy. Dragapult can deal huge damage to special walls like Galarian Slowking and Malaconda and can form a good VoltTurn core with Krilowatt. Krilowatt is a useful option on rain teams, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, bringing in rain sweepers like Barraskewda and Raging Bolt in to deal massive damage to foes, as well as benefitting from rain boosting its own Surf.</p>"

Thunder Wave can also be used as an option to cripple Chuggalong and unsuspecting physical threats such as Roaring Moon and Miasmaw looking for free setup, but Ground-types are immune to it and it makes Mollux even worse against them. Hydro Pump can be used when Mollux is employed on rain teams to threaten Ting-Lu and Garganacl, but the lack of accuracy can make Mollux more inconsistent, while the lack of PP worsens the matchup against balance teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Pokemon with Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Great Tusk, Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Gliscor greatly threaten Mollux with their Ground-type STAB moves. Pokemon such as Miasmaw and Roaring Moon can produce similar pressure with Ground-type coverage. Pokemon that Mollux usually checks consistently, such as Hemogoblin, Krilowatt, and Ogerpon-W, can run surprise Ground-type coverage to deal with Mollux.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Garganacl and Heatran can switch into any move that Mollux can use and are both immune to the burns and poisons that it can threaten other checks with while threatening it with Salt Cure and Earth Power, respectively. Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu have to worry a bit more about Lava Plume's burn chance, but they take little damage from Mollux and can freely set up Future Sight and Spikes against it, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off from Arghonaut and Ogerpon-W cripples Mollux by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, leaving it extremely vulnerable to entry hazards and jeopardizing its ability to check threats such as Darkrai and Krilowatt.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Miasmaw, and Jolly Kingambit can easily wallbreak past Mollux's weaker Defense stat with little risk. Mollux can discourage setup with Clear Smog but otherwise is greatly threatened.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Deoxys-S can greatly threaten Mollux with Psycho Boost. Iron Crown can quickly wear Mollux down with Psychic Noise and deny recovery or easily 2HKO it with Psyshock.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mollux's typing combined with recovery and an excellent ability in Dry Skin allows it to be a premium check to a wide variety of threats such as Iron Valiant, Hemogoblin, and Ogerpon-W. Stealth Rock allows Mollux to be an entry hazard setter that discourages Equilibra from switching in to use Rapid Spin. Rapid Spin allows Mollux to serve as a spinner that threatens common spin-blockers like Gholdengo and Necturna. Clear Smog shuts down setup sweepers such as Chuggalong, Raging Bolt, and Hemogoblin. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be chosen instead, as the poison chance can cripple Ground-type switch-ins. In addition, the increased Base Power can force out Ogerpon-W. Tera Fairy allows Mollux to be useful against sun by pressuring Walking Wake with its immunities and improves its matchup against Kingambit and Dragapult. Tera Steel gives Mollux a Future Sight resistance, making it a useful switch-in against Galarian Slowking. In addition, it walls non-Flamethrower Chuggalong and resists Stored Power, allowing it to use Clear Smog in a pinch. Tera Flying allows Mollux to flip its matchup against Equilibra, grants an immunity to Spikes, and prevents Ogerpon-W from catching it off guard with Stomping Tantrum. The given EV spread allows Mollux to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and threaten it with a Lava Plume. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense to allow Mollux to better switch in against Krilowatt and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Mollux fits best on balance teams, where its role compression and ability to check a large number of threats are appreciated. Its 4x Ground weakness leaves it very vulnerable to threats such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, the latter of which also makes a good teammate thanks to its Ground immunity. Corviknight and Equilibra make excellent partners for similar reasons. In return, Mollux is a solid answer to Pokemon that threaten them such as Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake. Mollux's large weakness to entry hazards if Heavy-Duty Boots is Knocked Off can easily compromise its ability to serve as a spinner. Thus, either a secondary hazard remover such as Equilibra or Corviknight or a Knock Off switch-in such as Gliscor or Clefable is needed. Mollux cannot threaten Garganacl to any degree and is quickly worn down by Salt Cure or KOed by Earthquake. Thus, allies that can offensively pressure Garganacl such as Ogerpon-W and Gholdengo are appreciated. Mollux is unable to hit Heatran and is very vulnerable to being trapped by Magma Storm and KOed by Earth Power, so Pokemon that can threaten Heatran such as Cresceidon and Ogerpon-W are excellent allies. Mollux can struggle to check physical threats such as Roaring Moon and Miasmaw, so physical walls such as Cresceidon, Arghonaut, and Skarmory fit well as teammates. Arghonaut can also help Mollux deal with Chuggalong, specifically its Stored Power sets, which otherwise OHKO Mollux. Psychic-types such as Deoxys-S and Galarian Slowking greatly threaten Mollux. Pokemon that can check these foes such as Equilibra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu make excellent teammates.</p>"

However, due to Malaconda's relatively small damage output, Glare is usually more effective long-term. Sucker Punch can be run to surprise and KO threats. This is especially useful against Dragapult. However, the loss of utility or longevity makes the move niche. Malaconda can opt to invest EVs in Special Defense instead of Defense in order to switch into Galarian Slowking and Mollux more easily. However, this runs the risk of Malaconda getting OHKOed by U-turn from Dragapult and Landorus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Malaconda's 4x weakness to Bug can be easily taken advantage of by Pokemon carrying U-turn such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Landorus-T. This often forces Malaconda in awkward positions where it must sacrifice momentum to avoid being OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Because of Malaconda's low physical bulk, it is easily taken advantage of by strong physical attackers such as Hemogoblin, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon such as Gliscor and Ogerpon-W can remove Malaconda's Heat Rock with Knock Off. The loss of Heat Rock greatly limits Walking Wake and Raging Bolt's wallbreaking potential and allows sun turns to more easily be stalled out by Equilibra and Gliscor with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Malaconda is vulnerable to all forms of hazards, often causing it to struggle to set up multiple instances of sun if hazards are down. However, Malaconda can mitigate this threat should it forgo Heat Rock for Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Miasmaw</strong>: Miasmaw can act as an anti-lead against Malaconda by preventing sun with Neutralizing Gas and threatening to sweep on the spot, usually forcing Malaconda out.</p>",

Knock Off allows Malaconda to threaten Galarian Slowking and punish potential switch-ins such as Venomicon, Great Tusk, and Hemogoblin with item removal. As Malaconda is often the best switch-in to Dragapult, Knock Off gives Malaconda a way to meaningfully threaten it. In addition, Knock Off heavily deters Galarian Slowking from switching in to change the weather with Chilly Reception. Parting Shot provides essential slow pivoting to safely bring an ally in while weakening the opposing Pokemon's offenses. This makes setting up for sweepers such as Raging Bolt and Chuggalong much easier. Malaconda's last two moveslots are extremely flexible. Glare shuts down setup sweepers such as Chuggalong, Ogerpon-W, Darkrai, and Roaring Moon while crippling Cresceidon. Rapid Spin allows Malaconda to remove entry hazards for its team. This helps allies such as Raging Bolt and Chuggalong set up. Synthesis can be used instead to provide Malaconda longevity, preventing Galarian Slowking from quickly wearing it out while resetting weather. Tera Fairy allows Malaconda to shed its massive weakness to U-turn and pivot against threats such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Tera Water prevents Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Heatran from forcing Malaconda out while allowing it to use Glare on Iron Moth and Chuggalong in a pinch. Heat Rock is the preferred item, as it extends sun's duration, allowing Malaconda's teammates to wallbreak more easily. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead to increase Malaconda's longevity by ignoring hazards, allowing it to switch in against Galarian Slowking and Krilowatt more consistently.</p> <p>Malaconda's sun-setting ability enables a plethora of excellent teammates such as Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. Walking Wake is synonymous with sun, as its sun-boosted Hydro Steam is able to decimate walls such as Galarian Slowking and Equilibra. Raging Bolt pairs well as a teammate thanks to its ability to easily break through Malaconda's checks such as Mollux and Venomicon. Raging Bolt also has a good matchup against Arghonaut and rain, which sun teams can struggle against. Choice Band Roaring Moon can slot excellently with Malaconda, as it easily pressures threats that check Malaconda such as Galarian Slowking and Mollux while providing excellent speed control with Protosynthesis's Speed boost. Sun structures are extremely vulnerable to threats such as Roaring Moon and Great Tusk, so Hemogoblin is an excellent revenge killer for these threats. In addition, Hemogoblin appreciates its Flare Blitz getting boosted by sun. Hemogoblin itself is a large threat against Malaconda. Therefore, Venomicon and Chuggalong are excellent allies. Great Tusk can slot in as a secondary spinner and a potential wincon with Bulk Up. With Protosynthesis's Speed boost, it is able to revenge kill threats such as Darkrai, while Protosynthesis's Defense boost allows it to counter Kingambit. Heatran is another possible teammate and can provide excellent value by trapping threats such as Arghonaut and Cresceidon with Magma Storm and removing them with Solar Beam. Hatterene is also a good fit, as it provides entry hazard control and Healing Wish support. Both of these qualities increases Malaconda's longevity, allowing it to be used more aggressively.</p>"

Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Jumbao OHKO Kingambit without Terastallizing.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jumbao is a strong asset to bulky offense teams, providing them with speed control and incredibly useful Healing Wish support. Defensive pivots that lack reliable recovery, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Equilibra, and Rotom-W, benefit immensely from Jumbao's ability to bring them back to full health late in the game, which gives them the freedom to take more hits early on.

Leftovers helps make up for Double-Edge's recoil alongside Horn Leech, while Magnet powers up Caribolt's Electric-type attacks even further. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Choice Scarf Jumbao at +1 Speed and Krilowatt at +0, but Adamant is an option to deal as much damage as possible, supporting its hyper offense teammates. Tera Grass is an option to turn Ground-types like Equilibra and Great Tusk into setup fodder, but Caribolt's main focus should be on wallbreaking as much as possible for its teammates.</p> <p>Caribolt is best utilized on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredible wallbreaking ability. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Venomicon-E appreciate Caribolt removing the hazard, allowing Iron Moth and Baxcalibur to run more offensive items over Heavy-Duty Boots. Other physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragonite love Caribolt powering through Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Arghonaut; Roaring Moon pairs particularly well with Caribolt, as it can threaten the Grass-types like Jumbao and Amoonguss that give Caribolt trouble with Tera Flying + Acrobatics. This love is shared by special sweepers like Iron Valiant and Hatterene, which need Skeledirge off the table before attempting a sweep. Caribolt appreciates entry hazards weakening physically bulky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu—which can beat Caribolt if it Terastallizes—into KO range of its attacks, so pairing it with a dedicated lead like Greninja or Meowscarada is suggested.</p>"

It can also run an EV spread of 52 HP / 52 Def / 112 SpA / 40 SpD / 52 Spe with a Modest nature if offensive prowess is preferred over Speed or raw bulk. This spread lets Equilibra avoid the OHKO from Hemogoblin's Flare Blitz and Walking Wake's Hydro Steam out of sun, lets it outspeed Skeledirge, and invests heavily in Special Attack for incredibly powerful Doom Desires. Bulletproof can be run to hard wall every Gholdengo set and, in conjunction with Tera Fairy, also wall Darkrai and Chuggalong.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Venomicon, Skarmory, Moltres, Zapdos, and Corviknight can all take Equilibra's hits well and retaliate with super efective moves.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Leftovers are essential for Equilibra if it wants to be kept healthy on a match. Knock Off from the likes of Gliscor, Arghonaut, and Clefable as well as Trick from Choice Scarf Gholdengo can make it way harder for it to stay healthy and would make it have to rely on Pain Split for healing.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Arghonaut, Rotom-W, Cresceidon, and Primarina can tank Equilibra's attacks then hit back with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Grass-types</strong>: Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior can sponge Equilibra's hits then strike back with their powerful STAB attacks. The former two can threaten an OHKO with Ivy Cudgel and Wood Hammer, with Ogerpon-W being an especially notable check, since it resists both of Equilibra's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Miasmaw, Zamazenta, and Gouging Fire can all heavily damage Equilibra, as they outpace Equilibra, target its weaker Defense stat, and can hit it super effectively. Roaring Moon and Greak Tusk can also heavily damage Equilibra while having the option to use Knock Off as a neutral option to remove Equilibra's Leftovers if it stays in or any switch-in's item.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Between its amazing defensive typing, high special bulk, and great matchups against common Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult, Equilibra is one of CAP's most reliable defensive pivots and entry hazard removal options. It fits primarily on balance teams, using its powerful Doom Desire to enable teammates and force checkmate scenarios where it can guarantee damage or a KO. Equilibra makes great use of Leftovers thanks to its many immunities and resilience to hazards, as with its immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web and 4x resistance to Stealth Rock, Heavy-Duty Boots is completely unnecessary. Pain Split maximizes Equilibra's recovery, which is useful to extend its longevity against bulkier teams; however, Protect can be used instead in order to maximize recovery from Leftovers, stall Doom Desire turns, scout Choice-locked foes and foes attempting to Tera, and block checkmate attempts done with opposing Doom Desire or Future Sight at the cost of leaving Equilibra without recovery if it loses its item. Flash Cannon can be used over Doom Desire if it needs to immediately pressure foes like Iron Valiant, Air Balloon Gholdengo, Enamorus, Gliscor, Rillaboom, and Hatterene. Maximum special bulk allows Equilibra to sponge powerful STAB attacks from special wallbreakers like Dragapult, Kyurem, and Darkrai and avoid being OHKOed by Focus Blast from +2 Gholdengo. Tera Water lets Equilibra take on Water- and Fire-type moves that would otherwise threaten it, whereas Tera Dragon is an alternative that offers a better matchup against Grass- and Electric-type foes like Caribolt and Krilowatt at the cost of a less useful defensive typing as a whole.</p> <p>Cresceidon appreciates Equilibra's ability to take on threatening Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Chuggalong and to remove entry hazards if Cresceidon loses its Heavy-Duty Boots; in return, Cresceidon deals with strong Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type wallbreakers that threaten Equilibra like Great Tusk, Gouging Fire, and Walking Wake. Arghonaut is another bulky Water-type that checks powerful physical wallbreakers like Zamazenta and Cinderace, can absorb Knock Off, and appreciates Equilibra checking Gliscor and keeping the field clear of hazards. Wallbreakers like Kyurem, Dragapult, and Ogerpon-W pair well with Equilibra, as the pressure it provides with Doom Desire is very valuable. Venomicon and Equilibra cover each other's weaknesess very well, as Venomicon can switch into the physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom, Hemogoblin, and Ogerpon-W that Equilibra fears, while Equilibra tanks the hits of the special wallbreakers like Stratagem and Kyurem that Venomicon can't take on.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots can be used over Loaded Dice on teams without much entry hazard control, as it alleviates Miasmaw's weakness to hazards, but it makes Scale Shot far less consistent at dealing damage. Fire Fang is a usable alternative to Tera Blast Fire that gives Miasmaw access to Fire-type coverage without Terastallizing, but it is generally not recommended, as it deals significantly less damage. First Impression allows Miasmaw to double as a revenge killer, but it requires Miasmaw to give up valuable coverage and does next to nothing to help it perform its primary role as a sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Miasmaw's typing leaves it very vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, which, in conjunction with its low physical bulk, greatly limit the number of opportunities it gets to set up.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Corviknight</strong>: Unless Miasmaw is running Tera Blast Fire, it is countered by Skarmory and Corviknight, as they resist Scale Shot, are immune to Miasmaw's other coverage moves, and can offset any boosts Miasmaw gains from Swords Dance by using Iron Defense. However, these Pokemon take massive damage from the aforementioned Tera Blast Fire.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: If Miasmaw is unable to land a Scale Shot, its middling Speed leaves it very vulnerable to getting revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Weavile and Dragapult. Even after using Scale Shot, Miasmaw must still be wary of Life Orb Deoxys-S, as it outspeeds and OHKOes Miasmaw with Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock damage. Similarly, Choice Scarf users such as Darkrai and Enamorus can take care of Miasmaw with Ice Beam and Moonblast, respectively, though the former requires that Miasmaw has taken prior damage, and the latter is not a common Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: As Miasmaw is quite frail on the physical side, especially after having its Defense dropped from repeated uses of Scale Shot, it is extremely vulnerable to Sucker Punch from the likes of Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott. Similarly, Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Hemogoblin are perfectly capable of revenge killing Miasmaw, but this measure may prove ineffective should Miasmaw Terastallize into a Ghost-type.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Dondozo, despite having Unaware shut off by Neutralizing Gas, serves as a perfectly serviceable check for Miasmaw, as it takes minimal damage from Scale Shot and OHKOes Miasmaw in return with Avalanche. Arghonaut can switch in when Miasmaw sets up and forces it out with Circle Throw or cripples it with Knock Off. In a similar vein, Great Tusk usually avoids the OHKO from +2 Scale Shot and can easily finish Miasmaw off with Ice Spinner. Zamazenta takes little damage from Miasmaw's attacks after a boost from Iron Defense and deals significant damage with Heavy Slam or forces it out with Roar. However, these Pokemon need to be relatively healthy to safely deal with Miasmaw.</p> <p><strong>Fast Status Spreaders</strong>: Cresceidon can switch in on the turn Miasmaw uses Swords Dance or Scale Shot and cripples it with Thunder Wave or Encore, or it can deal a large amount of damage with Moonblast, but it cannot deal with Miasmaw after it has set up, as it is OHKOed by +2 Gunk Shot. Dragapult can severely limit Miasmaw's effectiveness as a sweeper with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, or it can outright OHKO it with Dragon Darts. However, Dragapult cannot switch in directly, and it is unable to check Miasmaw at +1 Speed, since it is torn to shreds by Scale Shot.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Miasmaw is a deadly physical sweeper, and it owes its success to its sky-high Attack stat, access to Scale Shot, and incredibly powerful ability in Neutralizing Gas. Together, these qualities allow it to circumvent common counterplay for sweepers such as Arghonaut and Pixilate Extreme Speed from Hemogoblin and allow it to easily decimate weakened teams after a single Swords Dance boost. Earthquake serves as Miasmaw's main coverage move, hitting Steel-types that would otherwise take little damage from Scale Shot such as Equilibra, Heatran, and Kingambit. Gunk Shot is the preferred option for the last moveslot, as it allows Miasmaw to dispatch otherwise bothersome Fairy-types such as Cresceidon, Iron Valiant, and Clefable that would attempt to block Scale Shot. However, if Miasmaw is backed by teammates that can deal with these Pokemon, it can instead choose to run Substitute to protect itself from priority moves and harmful status conditions. When used alongside Tera Ghost, it can also generate opportunities to turn Extreme Speed users such as Hemogoblin and Dragonite into setup fodder. Tera Blast can be run alongside Tera Fire to provide coverage against Skarmory and Corviknight, both of which Miasmaw otherwise struggles against. Loaded Dice is generally recommended to ensure that Scale Shot deals consistently strong damage. Tera Ghost prevents Miasmaw from being revenge killed by Extreme Speed from the likes of Hemogoblin and Dragonite while also allowing it to serve as a situational spinblocker. Alternatively, Tera Poison improves Miasmaw's matchups against Fairy-types by patching up its Fairy weakness and strengthening Gunk Shot, notably allowing it to OHKO Cresceidon and Clefable prior to using Swords Dance.</p> <p>Miasmaw finds itself at home on hyper offense teams. Its typing leaves it extremely vulnerable to entry hazards, so running it alongside hazard control such as Caribolt, Great Tusk, or Hatterene is mandatory. Miasmaw struggles to break through Skarmory and Corviknight if it does not have access to Tera Blast Fire, so it appreciates being paired with a Fire-type that can take advantage of these Pokemon such as Iron Moth or Hemogoblin. Other strong Dragon-type sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon work well with Miasmaw, as not only do they help wear down each other's checks, but they also heavily appreciate Miasmaw's ability to deal with Hemogoblin, which would otherwise stop these Pokemon dead in their tracks as they take massive damage from Pixilate Extreme Speed. Miasmaw's physical frailty and weakness to hazards mean that it may have trouble finding ample opportunities to set up during a game, and, as a result, it is a good idea to pair it alongside a Pokemon that can set dual screens or Aurora Veil, such as Alolan Ninetales or Deoxys-S. Special wallbreakers such as Stratagem, Chuggalong, and Deoxys-S pair well with Miasmaw, as they can deal with many of the physically bulky Pokemon that may give Miasmaw trouble; in return, Miasmaw demolishes any special walls that would otherwise prevent them from making progress. Finally, Miasmaw gets good value from Spikes to help wear down physical walls, so Pokemon that can set Spikes such as Hisuian Samurott, Deoxys-S, and Glimmora naturally make for good teammates.</p>"

It also allows it to keep up momentum on sun teams. Tera Fairy allows Venomicon to tank a boosted Knock Off from Roaring Moon, heal off the damage with Roost, and wall Roaring Moon. Tera Steel, however, can surprise Stratagem and KO it with Body Press while also easing the pressure from opposing Future Sights and Doom Desires.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gholdengo and Kitsunoh</strong>: These two are the biggest nuisance for Venomicon, as they resist Hurricane, are immune to Sludge Bomb and Body Press, and are somewhat unbothered by Knock Off.

Krilowatt fears Knock Off, as it would lose a good chunk of its power, but if it comes in on any other move, it threatens Venomicon out easily.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem</strong>: Kyurem can threaten Venomicon out with a powerful Ice-type STAB move. However, it does have to worry about Body Press, especially if Venomicon Terastallizes.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Venomicon weak to Stealth Rock makes losing its Heavy-Duty Boots a bad situation, as it wants to stay as healthy as possible.

Sludge Bomb allows Venomicon to check Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin, Iron Valiant, and Cresceidon and poison potential switch-ins such as Zapdos and Dragapult. However, Hurricane can help check Fighting-types such as Revenankh and Arghonaut while also hitting Chuggalong neutrally. Body Press hits Steel-types such as Equilibra and Kingambit while also synergizing greatly with Stamina. Stealth Rock is a fantastic choice for the last slot, allowing Venomicon to compress roles within itself even further. That being said, Knock Off is an alternative, should Stealth Rock already be present on another team member. 152 Defense EVs allow Venomicon to OHKO Speed Booster Energy Roaring Moon with Body Press after Stealth Rock damage, with the rest going into Special Defense to cover its weaker defensive stat. Tera Water allows Venomicon to check sun teams, have an easier time versus Heatran, tanks an Ice Beam from Kyurem, and helps Venomicon tank Doom Desire for its teammates. Tera Dragon also helps Venomicon check sun teams and allows it to handle Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting deserve a mention mainly to nail Kingambit with Body Press, and it also provides a valuable resistance to Stealth Rock, which can be useful should Venomicon lose its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p>Steel-types such as Equilibra and Kingambit appreciate Venomicon's ability to shut down Fighting- and Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Landorus-T. In return, they check Gholdengo and Kitsunoh, which can take anything Venomicon throws at them, and Equilibra can provide entry hazard removal should Venomicon lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Psychic-types such as Deoxys-S and Galarian Slowking can be a pain as well, so Dark-types like Darkrai and Kingambit can be effective at threatening them and absorbing Future Sight. Knock Off absorbers such as Ogerpon-W and Gliscor are fantastic partners because Venomicon wants to keep its Heavy-Duty Boots for as long as possible.

Body Press gets boosted by every hit that lands on Venomicon thanks to Stamina and pairs extremely well with Hurricane and Sludge Bomb, nailing Steel-types such as Kingambit and Equilibra. Tera Water gives Venomicon the ability to check sun teams, beat Heatran one-on-one more easily, tank an Ice Beam from Kyurem, though it still fears Freeze-Dry, and tank Doom Desire for its teammates. Tera Dragon also lets Venomicon check sun teams, but it also grants it the strength to handle Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting mainly nails Kingambit with Body Press, but it also provides an important resistance to Stealth Rock, which can be helpful should Venomicon lose its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Venomicon fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive benefits and ability to act as a late-game sweeper. As a result, Venomicon benefits from having more offensive partners, such as Weavile and Dragapult, that help apply pressure to foes. Ogerpon-W and Great Tusk help ease the matchup against Steel-types such as Equilibra and Gholdengo that Venomicon struggles with. Other good partners such as Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit that appreciate Venomicon's ability to blow open holes in the opponent's defensive core so they can clean up.

At +2, it will even OHKO Multiscale Cresceidon. Explosion also gives a free switch-in to a teammate, grabbing huge amounts of momentum quickly. However, Explosion is unreliable, as it takes away valuable utility and can be hard to use with Hemogoblin’s low Speed. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to cripple threats like Great Tusk, Venomicon, and Kingambit but is mostly useless against checks such as Gliscor and Krilowatt. Choice Band gives Hemogoblin immediate power, allowing it to sweep with Extreme Speed more easily and break through Unaware Dondozo with Tera Fairy. However, this prevents Hemogoblin from using Bulk Up, leaves Hemogoblin vulnerable to all hazards, and is easily taken advantage of by Venomicon. Trick can be used in conjunction with Choice Band to cripple threats such as Venomicon and Equilibra with a hampering item. However, the lack of Choice Band or a setup move is noticeable, making Hemogoblin’s attacks rather weak. Tera Water allows Hemogoblin to more easily win mirror matchups against opposing Hemogoblin by resisting Flare Blitz, but otherwise is inferior to Tera Ground. Hemogoblin can also choose to run a specially defensive EV spread with a recovery move such as Moonlight or Wish and Tera Poison. This allows it to more easily set up on Venomicon while also making it more resilient into special wallbreakers such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Wish also provides healing for teammates. However, doing so heavily reduces Hemogoblin's revenge killing potential due to a lack of Attack investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Venomicon, Galarian Slowking, and Mollux can all tank Hemogoblin’s attacks and threaten it with Sludge Bomb. Pecharunt is more rare but does the same and threatens Toxic or Malignant Chain. All of them have to be wary of Hemogoblin Terastallizing, however.</p> <p><strong>Fast Fairy-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Iron Moth, Plasmanta, Venomicon-E, and Heatran can tank a Pixilate-boosted Extreme Speed and threaten back with Poison-type STAB moves and Earth Power for the latter. Heatran has the added danger of trapping Hemogoblin with Magma Storm.</p> <p><strong>Krilowatt</strong>: Krilowatt's great natural bulk lets it take a single Extreme Speed and force Hemogoblin out with the threat of a super effective Surf.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor and Landorus-T can absorb an attack from Hemogoblin and immediately threaten it back with Earthquake, while Great Tusk can threaten it with Headlong Rush and tank a hit at the cost of a defensive Tera.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-resistant Tera Users</strong>: Tera Poison and Tera Fire from threats such as Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Great Tusk can completely shut down a revenge kill attempt from Hemogoblin, with Tera Fire also heavily reducing Flare Blitz's damage, forcing Hemogoblin to either get KOed itself, or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Users:</strong> Skeledirge and Dondozo are walls that are nearly impossible for Hemogoblin to break through. Skeledirge can slowly use Torch Song to chip its way through Hemogoblin’s HP, while Dondozo takes chunks of Hemogoblin’s health through Waterfall or Liquidation. Arghonaut can wall Hemogoblin too after burning Tera, freely setting Spikes if Hemogoblin lacks Taunt. Arghonaut can also force Hemogoblin out afterwards with Circle Throw.</p>",

Pixilate-boosted Extreme Speed allows Hemogoblin to easily KO weakened targets and pressure offensive threats. Its strength also lets Hemogoblin sweep through teams with frail offensive cores such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant with particular ease if it finds a setup opportunity. Flare Blitz dents threats that resist Extreme Speed, such as Equilibra and Gholdengo. Bulk Up raises Hemogoblin’s middling Attack, allowing it to always OHKO defensive Equilibra with Flare Blitz at +1 and offensive Great Tusk with Extreme Speed at +2. Bulk Up also makes it harder to revenge kill Hemogoblin, turning offensive Great Tusk’s Headlong Rush and Booster Energy Roaring Moon’s Earthquake into a 2HKO at +1. Taunt stops slower foes such as Venomicon, Arghonaut, and Clefable from recovering their HP, allowing Hemogoblin to slowly wear down its checks throughout the game. Spikes is an option to capitalize on forced switches. Tera Fairy maximizes Extreme Speed’s wallbreaking power, while Tera Poison allows Hemogoblin to beat Cresceidon and turn defensive Venomicon into setup fodder. Tera Ground with Tera Blast allows Hemogoblin to break past threats such as Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta, as well as allowing it to win the mirror matchup against opposing Hemogoblin. The EV spread allows Hemogoblin to maximize Attack while outspeeding Adamant Kingambit. Alternatively, Hemogoblin can run 76 Speed EVs to outspeed Venomicon while gaining bulk</p> <p>Both Hex and Choice Specs Dragapult provide great synergy with Hemogoblin. Dragapult provides great speed control and can beat Great Tusk and Iron Moth, which Hemogoblin can struggle against. Dragapult’s Will-O-Wisp can wear down Hemogoblin’s checks such as Cresceidon, Venomicon, and Great Tusk over time, allowing it to KO them with Extreme Speed. Ground-immune teammates such as Equilibra and Gliscor greatly assist Hemogoblin by checking threats such as Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor. Ogerpon-W threatens Gliscor and Skeledirge for Hemogoblin while easily switching into Water-types such as Krilowatt. Together they can navigate around Venomicon and overwhelm it. With Taunt from Hemogoblin and Encore from Ogerpon-W, Venomicon quickly gets chipped and cannot easily recover HP without giving Hemogoblin setup opportunities. Plasmanta is also a great teammate, although more niche; it easily breaks through walls such as Venomicon, Cresceidon, Dondozo, and Skeledirge that Hemogoblin would otherwise struggle against. Plasmanta is also a great check to Ogerpon-W, which greatly threatens Hemogoblin. Entry hazards and duel screens leads such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S found on hyper offense greatly benefit Hemogoblin, giving it easier sweeping and setup opportunities.</p>"

Rocky Helmet in conjunction with Rough Skin can be utilized instead to punish foes using contact moves such as Landorus-T's U-turn and Weavile's Triple Axel. It also punishes opponents who try to mindlessly use Knock Off with Pokemon like Arghonaut, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon. Cresceidon can use Tera Poison to avoid being poisoned by Venomicon and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb and foes using Toxic while also checking Hemogoblin better. Tera Dragon is an option to shed its Electric and Grass weaknesses, becoming a solid check to foes such as Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Caribolt.</p> <p>Hex Dragapult is a fantastic partner, checking the Electric- and Grass-types that threaten Cresceidon and running through paralyzed foes. Despite its commendable bulk and Fairy typing, Cresceidon is not the best Knock Off switch-in, as Heavy-Duty Boots aids it in soft-checking foes like Gholdengo and Stratagem. As such, a second Knock Off switch-in such as Gliscor, Skarmory, or Landorus-T is appreciated. If Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, then hazard removal options such as Equilibra, Great Tusk, and Corviknight help Cresceidon stay healthy. Equilibra is generally a great match with Cresceidon, taking on Electric-types such as Caribolt and Raging Bolt for it, while Cresceidon answers Water- and Fire-types such as Arghonaut, Walking Wake, and Cinderace. Together, they also can effectively check Hemogoblin without needing to expend Terastallization, as Equilibra can outspeed paralyzed Hemogoblin and OHKO most variants with Earth Power. Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Garganacl all alleviate Cresceidon's status weakness by switching into Toxic and Thunder Wave from the opponent's walls.</p>"
