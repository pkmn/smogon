        "description": "<p>Mega Venusaur excels as a wall on Grass teams, effectively tanking Fire- and Ice-type hits with its Thick Fat ability. It relies on Sludge Bomb as its main attack, dealing with Grass- and Fairy-types—such as Rillaboom and Iron Valiant—while also poisoning walls like Mega Sableye, Iron Hands, and Porygon2. Synthesis provides reliable healing, which, combined with Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb's poison, allows Mega Venusaur to wear down foes such as Garchomp. Hidden Power Fire handles Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo, although Earth Power can also be used to answer Steel-, Poison- and Fire-types such as Heatran and Iron Moth. The Speed EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outpace Adamant Azumarill. Mega Venusaur's teammates greatly appreciate its ability to handle threats like Mega Diancie and Mega Scizor and clear Toxic Spikes. Ferrothorn and Cradily form a solid defensive core, absorbing hits from Flying- and Psychic-types such as Galarian Moltres and Tapu Lele, while Mega Venusaur tanks Fire-, Ice-, and Fighting-type attacks. Whimsicott and Tapu Bulu help with the Dragon matchup, and Celebi handles the problematic Poison-types like Toxapex and Nidoking. Rillaboom and Breloom provide strong priority, allowing them to threaten faster threats such as Nihilego. Rillaboom also sets up Grassy Terrain to supply additional passive recovery along with Mega Venusaur's Leech Seed, boosting longevity. Meowscarada and Zarude serve as speedy wallbreakers that are capable of breaking through walls such as Clodsire and Skeledirge. Both also benefit from pivoting into Mega Venusaur to tank attacks from the aforementioned Fighting-, Fire-, and Ice-types.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Venusaur finds a solid position on Poison teams thanks to its secondary Grass typing, good natural bulk, and helpful set of tools. Giga Drain threatens Water- and Ground-types like Barraskewda, Swampert, and Great Tusk. Hidden Power Fire is used to deal with Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Leech Seed provides recovery and forces out bulky targets such as Blissey. Earth Power threatens Fire- and Poison-type targets like non-Air Balloon Heatran and Toxapex. Sludge Bomb handles Fairy- and Grass-types like Mega Altaria, Tapu Koko, and Ogerpon-W along with being able to spread poison, thus chipping foes down. The given EV spread is used to maximize Mega Venusaur's bulk while still allowing it to outspeed Adamant Azumarill. Alolan Muk serves as a solid partner for Mega Venusaur, being a specially defensive wall capable of threatening Psychic- and Ghost-types like Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, Blacephalon, and Gholdengo. Galarian Slowking can handle threats such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Kyurem, which easily blast through Mega Venusaur. Crobat provides Defog support, granting Mega Venusaur safe entry, and it can also deal with threats such as Mega Gallade with Brave Bird and Substitute Hydreigon with Infiltrator Toxic. Toxapex complements Mega Venusaur as a physically defensive wall, capable of taking on foes like Mega Scizor, Galarian Zapdos, and Weavile along with providing Z-Haze for boosted threats like Kommo-o. Offensive threats like Sneasler, Nidoking, and Nihilego appreciate Mega Venusaur being able to take hits from bulky Ground-types like Clodsire and Hippowdon. In response, Sneasler can remove specially defensive threats like Hisuian Goodra and Blissey thanks to its powerful Close Combat, Nidoking can remove threats like Corviknight, Gliscor, and Gholdengo thanks to its diverse and offensive movepool, and Nihilego can handle Fire- and Flying-type threats like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T.</p>"

Tough Claws-boosted Flare Blitz fires off nuclear-powered attacks, heavily denting walls such as Mandibuzz, Gliscor, and Mega Sableye. Dragon Claw, also powered up by Tough Claws, threatens Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Kommo-o. Earthquake threatens switch-ins like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Heatran, while Roost increases Mega Charizard X's longevity and mitigates recoil damage from Flare Blitz. Alternatively, Thunder Punch may be used to deal more damage to Slowbro, Pelipper, and Tapu Fini while still retaining super effective coverage against Toxapex. Volcarona is an exceptional teammate, as it threatens physical walls such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Hippowdon after a Quiver Dance. Torkoal supports Mega Charizard X with sun to boost Flare Blitz's power and remove rain, Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins, and Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Rotom-H sets up Reflect and Light Screen to ease Mega Charizard X's setup process and offers pivoting with Volt Switch. Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a great late-game cleaner and is appreciated to wear down troublesome walls like Skeledirge and Slowbro as well as cripple Toxapex and Porygon2 with Trick. Heatran traps and withers down Toxapex with Magma Storm and prevents Stealth Rock from being set up using Taunt. Cinderace provides entry hazard control with Court Change and brings Mega Charizard X in using U-turn.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y makes for a great wallbreaker on Flying teams. Fire Blast, although it has lower accuracy, can be used over Flamethrower, notably 2HKOing Alolan Muk and Clodsire under sun. Solar Beam covers Water-types that resist Flamethrower like Swampert and Rotom-W, and thanks to sun, it does not need to charge. Focus Blast targets Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Heatran. Alternatively, Scorching Sands can be used to target Heatran more reliably, as well as providing coverage against Toxapex and Iron Hands, the latter of which can be greatly hindered thanks to the burn chance. Hidden Power Electric can be run over Roost to greatly threaten Water teams in tandem with Solar Beam, threatening the likes of Pelipper, Mantine, and Gyarados. Dragonite and Mega Charizard Y form a great offensive pairing, with Mega Charizard Y threatening physically bulky threats like Mega Scizor and Corviknight for Dragonite, while Dragonite acts as a late-game sweeper and deals with Alolan Muk and Nihilego for Mega Charizard Y. Corviknight and Mantine are essential teammates, as they remove Stealth Rock with Defog, which would otherwise effectively leave Mega Charizard Y out of the match. Corviknight also brings Mega Charizard Y in with U-turn, while Mantine helps against rain teams, taking hits from Barraskewda and Mega Swampert. In turn, Mega Charizard Y takes out threats to them both like Rotom-W and Magnezone. It also appreciates entry hazard support from Landorus and Gliscor wearing down foes to help it wallbreak more easily, while both setters also provide an Electric immunity. In return, Mega Charizard Y handles Ice-types like Articuno and Mamoswine. Enamorus makes for a great partner because it handles Dark-types like Weavile and Greninja and provides Healing Wish support; it appreciates the removal of bulky Steel-types in return.</p>"

Heat Wave complements Hurricane well by heavily damaging Steel-types like Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, which makes Mega Pidgeot very effective against Psychic, Grass, and Bug teams. Roost heightens Mega Pidgeot's longevity by taking advantage of defensive Pokemon that can't hit it very hard, such as Mega Sableye and Slowbro. In the last slot, Toxic's ability to cripple switch-ins like Iron Hands, Rotom-W, and Mantine is preferred, but U-turn is valuable to keep momentum and flee from checks such as Heatran and Alolan Muk. Ursaluna forms an incredible wallbreaking core with Mega Pidgeot; it is able to demolish special walls like Clodsire and Hisuian Goodra and can switch into Electric-type moves that target the bird. In return, Mega Pidgeot helps Ursaluna beat physical walls like Mega Venusaur and Skarmory, revenge kills Grass- and Fighting-types such as Ogerpon-W and Keldeo that threaten the bear, and is able to U-turn into Ursaluna so it activates its Flame Orb safely. Staraptor is a great defensive pivot that removes entry hazards for Mega Pidgeot and brings it into the field unscathed with U-turn. Similarly, Chansey, Blissey, and Porygon2 are very bulky partners that can switch into most attacks aimed at Mega Pidgeot and pivot into it via Teleport. Chansey and Blissey also lay down Stealth Rock to help Mega Pidgeot net more KOs, notably letting it OHKO Mega Venusaur and 2HKO Toxapex with Hurricane.</p>"

Nasty Plot provides Alolan Raichu with the much-needed boost to OHKO Gliscor, Sinistcha, and Iron Hands with Shattered Psyche. Psyshock is preferred when using Life Orb, as it dispatches special walls like Clodsire and Galarian Slowking after minimal chip damage. Life Orb also lets Alolan Raichu OHKO Alolan Muk and Rotom-W with Rising Voltage at +2. Grass Knot and Focus Blast heavily damage Pokemon that scoff at its Electric- and Psychic-type moves like Mega Swampert, Iron Treads, and Hydreigon. However, it is to be noted that Alolan Raichu requires a Life Orb to have a shot at OHKOing Hydreigon. Normaum Z with Hyper Beam may be considered, as it pummels through targets Grass Knot covers on top of heavily damaging Mega Latias, which typically overwhelms Electric teams. Tapu Koko is a mandatory teammate for Alolan Raichu, as it sets Electric Terrain, deals with Dragon-types like Mega Altaria and Roaring Moon, and pressures Flying and Water teams extremely well due to its wide coverage. Physical attackers like Zeraora and Iron Hands help against special walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Hisuian Goodra that Alolan Raichu struggles against. Ground-immune teammates like Zapdos and Rotom-W are appreciated, as they not only switch in against speedy threats like Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Iron Treads when Electric Terrain ends but also deal with Grass- and Ground-types like Celebi and Great Tusk.</p>"

Flamethrower deals with Steel-types not threatened by Earth Power such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Ice Beam removes problematic Ground- and Flying-types like Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Zapdos. Stealth Rock can help chip foes that can swap into Earth Power like Mega Charizard Y. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be run to complete the BoltBeam coverage and hit Water-types like Pelipper, Dondozo, and Mantine, which otherwise wall Nidoking. Choice Scarf Sneasler forms a solid offensive core with Nidoking. Sneasler not only removes specially defensive targets like Hisuian Goodra and Blissey, but also removes faster targets like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona if running Rock Slide, while Nidoking deals with threats that would stop Sneasler like Gholdengo and Toxapex. Mega Venusaur handles the Water- and Ground-type foes that would overwhelm Nidoking such as Barraskewda, Mega Gyarados, Swampert, and Mamoswine. Alolan Muk deals with Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Hisuian Zoroark, Alolan Raichu, and Tapu Lele, which pose a significant issue for Nidoking. Galarian Slowking can take on threats such as Choice Specs Latios and Tornadus-T and use Future Sight to help overwhelm special walls like Swampert.

Encore enables Alolan Ninetales to disrupt walls and slower setup sweepers like Ting-Lu and Tapu Fini. Alolan Ninetales's teammates appreciate its supportive capabilities; setup sweepers like Swords Dance Weavile and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur have a lot more setup opportunities, and offensive Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan have an easier time switching in. Cloyster is a stellar partner; its defensive set removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and sets Spikes to wear down Keldeo and Toxapex for Alolan Ninetales, while Shell Smash variants can more easily set up with its assistance. SubRoost Kyurem helps Alolan Ninetales pressure Water teams with its own Freeze-Dry and checks Fighting-types like Galarian Zapdos with a Chople Berry.

Flare Blitz OHKOes multiple Steel-types that Rock teams can struggle with, such as Ferrothorn, Gholdengo, and, after Stealth Rock, Corviknight and Skarmory. Head Smash hits even harder and is the main option against neutral targets, notably 2HKOing Gliscor, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Extreme Speed mitigates the lacking Speed tier Hisuian Arcanine has, allowing it to revenge kill foes such as Greninja and Barraskewda. Close Combat OHKOes Heatran after Stealth Rock, Ursaluna after minimal chip, and 2HKOes Archaludon, minimizing would-be checks. Choice Scarf can be an alternative option to outspeed and KO foes such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Aerodactyl, and Zeraora, but the lack of damage output and minimal benefit to Extreme Speed makes it more situational. Ogerpon-C can handle the Ground- and Water-types that can easily pressure Hisuian Arcanine such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Swampert. Entry hazards from Shuckle and Mega Diancie can considerably increase Hisuian Arcanine's offensive pressure, with Shuckle's Sticky Web minimizing the reliance on Extreme Speed to outspeed foes, and Stealth Rock from Shuckle or Spikes from Mega Diancie easing KOs on foes.

Morning Sun gives Hisuian Arcanine even more staying power. Substitute capitalizes on its ability to force out Steel- and Flying-types like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Extreme Speed picks off weakened threats like Mega Lopunny and Sneasler. 28 Defense EVs let Hisuian Arcanine survive a +2 Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, allowing Hisuian Arcanine to OHKO it back with Flare Blitz. As Hisuian Arcanine is not strong enough to break through dedicated physical walls like Porygon2, Toxapex, and Archaludon, setup sweepers like Swords Dance Iron Boulder and Ogerpon-C that deal with these are greatly appreciated. Ogerpon-C also additionally deals with Water- and Ground-type walls like Hippowdon and Quagsire, which scoff at Hisuian Arcanine's attempts to wallbreak. Mega Diancie and Mega Aerodactyl deal with Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Kommo-o that check Hisuian Arcanine, and in return, they benefit from Hisuian Arcanine weakening or removing Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Skarmory, allowing Mega Diancie and Mega Aerodactyl to heavily pressure teams like Bug, Flying, and Steel late-game. Entry hazard support in Shuckle, particularly Sticky Web, lets Hisuian Arcanine deal with Choice Scarf threats like Excadrill and Gholdengo, and faster Pokemon like Choice Specs Greninja.

Mega Sableye is also excellent to pair with Alolan Muk, as it grants Dark a bulky Magic Bounce user. Meowscarada helps threaten out several Water- and Ground-type threats that threaten Alolan Muk like Choice Band Urshifu-R, Mega Swampert, and Great Tusk with its powerful Flower Trick. Both Hydreigon and Weavile appreciate having Alolan Muk on the team, as it can effectively Pursuit trap Tapu Lele. Alolan Muk complements Ting-Lu's hazard-stacking capabilities by spreading poison to wear down foes or removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Hydreigon is a wallbreaker that checks defensive Pokemon that Alolan Muk struggles to break like Hippowdon, opposing Alolan Muk, and Toxapex. Weavile checks Ground-, Dragon-, and Flying-types such as Garchomp, Mega Altaria, and Landorus.</p>"

Swords Dance boosts its power even further, overpowering foes such as Toxapex and Celesteela. Return is its main Flying-type STAB move, hitting Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur, Volcarona, and Kommo-o,. Using Frustration with 0 happiness is also an option, as it prevents Ditto from doing too much damage after copying Mega Pinsir. Quick Attack allows Mega Pinsir to revenge kill fast threats such as Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-H, and +1 Kommo-o. Close Combat nails Steel- and Rock-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, but Earthquake is also viable to hit Gholdengo and Aegislash, as well as Fire-types such as Torkoal and Volcanion. Mega Pinsir's secondary Flying typing makes it 4x weak to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates entry hazard removal from Rapid Spin users such as Forretress and Armaldo. Forretress also provides great defensive utility, taking physical Flying- and Rock-type moves with ease while having Volt Switch to pivot Mega Pinsir onto the field safely. Mega Pinsir appreciates entry hazards on the opposing side as well, such as Stealth Rock from Kleavor, Spikes and Toxic Spikes from Forretress, and Sticky Web from Araquanid and Galvantula. Furthermore, Kleavor can deal with Flying- and Fire-types such as Zapdos and Moltres, and Araquanid can deal with Fire-types as well as take on strong special attacks from the likes of Tapu Lele and Gholdengo, dealing damage back with Mirror Coat. Araquanid's access to Magic Coat allows it to deflect status and hazards as well. Scizor can check Ice- and Rock-types such as Baxcalibur and Ogerpon-C with its STAB Bullet Punch, as well as pivot with U-turn and remove Stealth Rock with Defog. Choice Scarf Buzzwole is a great partner and revenge killer, being able to wipe out the remaining foes if Mega Pinsir is knocked out. Volcarona appreciates Mega Pinsir's ability to deal with Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur, and in return, it acts as a special sweeper that can deal with physical walls such as Skarmory. Lokix is a great revenge killer thanks to its strong First Impression putting foes into range of Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack. Its access to Throat Chop and Knock Off also deals with Ghost-types, and the former prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which would otherwise be a pain to deal with, while the latter removes items. Equipping Lokix with a Z-Crystal, such as Buginium Z or Darkinium Z, can deal massive damage to foes that would otherwise be difficult to break through.</p>"

Reversing the momentum of fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard X, and Excadrill allows Ditto to force counterplay against offensive teams. Ditto can also take advantage of entry hazard setters and removers, such as Ferrothorn, Kleavor, and Zapdos, using their own longevity or utility against them. In order to take advantage of Pokemon that use either Return or Frustration, such as Mega Altaria or Mega Pinsir, Ditto likes to run 128 Happiness instead of 255 or 0. Walls like Blissey and Porygon2 appreciate Ditto being able to prevent threats such as Baxcalibur and Spectrier from using them as setup fodder, while Ditto appreciates both defensive switch-ins and slow pivots via their use of Teleport. Mega Lopunny is a staple on Normal teams that accents Ditto's role expertly; many of the offensive threats and setup sweepers that revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Galarian Moltres, are usually very weak to their own sets or coverage. Mega Lopunny can lure a threat in and pivot with U-turn, allowing Ditto to come in safely and transform. Ditto appreciates Mega Lopunny's Speed tier and fast pivot with U-turn, as well as potentially setting up Ditto with Encore Sets to stop foes from using Substitute or setting up completely. Hisuian Zoroark makes for another stellar teammate for Ditto, as Hisuian Zoroark disguised as a passive Pokemon, such as Blissey, or another offensive threat, such as Diggersby or Mega Lopunny, can lead to Hisuian Zoroark wallbreaking and netting KOs on vital foes, making it easier for Ditto to sweep once it has transformed. While Ditto is immune to Sticky Web, it is susceptible to other hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, so forms of hazard control such as Staraptor or Cyclizar are appreciated. Staraptor is another defensive option, while Cyclizar can enable Ditto to utilize Transform with a Substitute from Shed Tail. Smeargle on more offense-oriented teams' pairs well with Ditto, as Smeargle can set hazards with Stone Axe or Ceaseless Edge and spread status with Nuzzle, Mortal Spin, or Spore, allowing Ditto to exploit the opposing team easier. Smeargle will usually give up Sticky Web when paired with Ditto so as to not hinder Ditto's revenge killing prowess.</p>"

Earthquake pairs well with Stone Edge, threatening the likes of Heatran and Hisuian Goodra and OHKOing Tapu Koko after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Fang is a great coverage option against Ground- and Dragon-types such as Landorus and Garchomp. Dual Wingbeat breaks through Fighting- and Grass-types such as Kommo-o, Mega Gallade, and Ogerpon-W. Pursuit allows Mega Aerodactyl to take advantage of foes like Victini and Latias that are forced out due to being Choice-locked into an undesirable move, and it punishes Gholdengo if it switches out expecting Earthquake. Stealth Rock aids both Mega Aerodactyl and its teammates in their wallbreaking or sweeping, while Taunt shuts down passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Mantine and Corviknight are essential teammates, as they remove Stealth Rock with Defog so that Mega Aerodactyl finds more opportunities to switch in; they also provide a defensive backbone to shield Mega Aerodactyl from Water- and Ice-types like Mega Swampert and Choice Scarf Weavile. In return, Mega Aerodactyl deals with Fire- and Electric-types that the two of them hate like Volcarona, Zapdos, and Zeraora. Moltres is helpful in dealing with Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Landorus and Gliscor both set up entry hazards to aid Mega Aerodactyl in its cleaning when it's not running Stealth Rock; the two of them also act as stallbreakers, provide an Electric immunity, and bust through Toxapex. Despite its great Speed tier, Mega Aerodactyl is outsped by Kommo-o and Hisuian Lilligant at +1 and by Choice Scarf users such as Nihilego, making Choice Scarf Enamorus a great teammate that is able to revenge kill these threats. Special wallbreakers like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus-T deal with physically defensive walls like Celesteela, Slowbro, and Ferrothorn, which would otherwise wall Mega Aerodactyl; they can also pivot Mega Aerodactyl in against specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking and Hisuian Goodra.</p>"

Heat Wave beats Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Iron Treads, and Ferrothorn, thus making it an incredible asset in the Steel and Grass matchups. Hidden Power Ice cleanly OHKOes Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used if reliably eliminating Gastrodon and Swampert is more important. Volt Switch lets Zapdos switch out of its checks like Tyranitar and Blissey, keeping momentum in favor of Zapdos's team. As dangerous as Zapdos is, it is highly susceptible to Stealth Rock; hence, Rotom-W is a great partner that can use Defog while also helping Zapdos beat Ground-types thanks to Hydro Pump. Iron Hands and Zeraora help Zapdos wallbreak by wearing down special walls like Heatran, Blissey, and Clodsire. Regieleki and Alolan Raichu can take advantage of Zapdos weakening teams and removing Ground-types so that they can clean up with their deadly Rising Voltage later in the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Zapdos is one of the few Defog options Flying teams have access to that heavily punishes Gholdengo. Aside from this perk, defensive Zapdos is also able to switch into Iron Valiant, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Scizor thanks to its decent bulk and typing. Heat Wave deters Gholdengo from switching in to block Defog, lets Zapdos check Mega Scizor and Bisharp, and roasts Ferrothorn and Jirachi. Alternatively, Hurricane when paired with Discharge makes Water teams unable to switch into Zapdos, and it lets Zapdos answer Mega Venusaur, Mega Pinsir, and Great Tusk. Volt Switch pivots in teammates like Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite, letting Zapdos keep the momentum going. Pressure ensures entry hazards stay off by draining the opponent's Stealth Rock PP, but Static is useful for punishing Triple Axel users like Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny, both of which are problematic for Flying teams due to their high Speed. The given EV spread allow Zapdos to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's attacks and Mega Lopunny's Return and the OHKO from +2 Iron Valiant's Ice Punch, allowing Zapdos to retaliate or pivot out to the appropriate teammate. 16 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant Bisharp, and a Modest nature allows Zapdos to 2HKO Gholdengo. The alternative EV spread lets Zapdos outspeed Urshifu-R and OHKO it with Discharge. Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite appreciate Zapdos's pivoting capabilitie, and they deal with Heatran, Blissey, and Gliscor, which readily check Zapdos. Celesteela is the preferred Steel-type partner to Zapdos, as it deals with Fairy- and Ice-types like Mega Diancie, Alolan Ninetales, and Kyurem, which take advantage of Zapdos. In return, Zapdos keeps hazards off to improve Celesteela's staying power. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T checks Ogerpon-W, Kommo-o, and Iron Valiant for Zapdos and loves its ability to pivot it in against Mega Venusaur to use as setup fodder.</p>"

Knock Off targets Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowking, Jirachi, and Galarian Corsola. Finally, U-turn can bring in teammates while getting chip damage on the foe as well as switching Galarian Zapdos out of bad matchups like Slowbro and Gholdengo. Iron Valiant equipped with Choice Specs or a Z-Crystal is able to break through Pokemon that wall Galarian Zapdos such as Kyurem, Latias, Raging Bolt, and Tapu Koko. Mega Gallade is another great teammate for Galarian Zapdos, as it acts as a great setup sweeper and wallbreaker with Swords Dance and greatly improves the Poison matchup. Iron Hands also pairs well, as it has a neutrality to Flying and can hit Flying-types with Ice Punch or Thunder Punch and has access to a slow Volt Switch that can bring it in safely. Iron Hands's great bulk also allows it to take on otherwise problematic threats like Enamorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Pelipper. Great Tusk is a nice support Pokemon for Galarian Zapdos, as it provides an Electric-immunity as well as Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, helping Galarian Zapdos get more KOs. It's also a great physical wall and can take out threats such as Iron Hands and Zeraora. In return, Galarian Zapdos handles Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur for it.

Hisuian Samurott provides entry hazard support in order to wear down incoming foes into OHKO range for Galarian Moltres, and in return, Galarian Moltres can threaten the Grass- and Fighting-types the two of them struggle with such as Mega Venusaur and Urshifu-R. Grimmsnarl is another great teammate, as it is able to set up dual screens to further make Galarian Moltres difficult to KO, and it can also run Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock from being set. Because of Galarian Moltres's part-Flying-typing, it is vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Because of this vulnerability, it appreciates hazard control from Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce, and Mega Sableye is also able to cripple opposing foes with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Choice Band users such as Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada can check walls Galarian Moltres struggles with like Dondozo and Clodsire. In return, Meowscarada and Weavile appreciate Galarian Moltres matching up well against Volcarona and Roaring Moon appreciates Galarian Moltres matching up well against Great Tusk. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can be paired with other sweepers such as Swords Dance Weavile and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon to soften each other's checks to enable each other to sweep. For example, Weavile is able to threaten Ting-Lu and Clodsire, while Galarian Moltres is able to handle Choice Scarf Gholdengo in return.

Aqua Jet is Azumarill's answer to threats that outspeed it, such as Volcarona, Tapu Koko, and Nidoking. Aside from dealing with Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Slowbro, and Sinistcha, Knock Off is Azumarill's best coverage option against walls that resist its other attacks, such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Breakneck Blitz coming off Return beats Mega Venusaur as well as Icium Z Toxapex, which doesn't fear Knock Off. Alternatively, Liquidation could be used as a stronger STAB option for slower foes like Iron Hands, Ting-Lu, and Celesteela, which is important if a Jolly nature is used.

Future Sight is used to deal solid damage and create traps that physically attacking teammates such as Sneasler and Okidogi can make use of to break walls such as Blissey and Mega Venusaur, which would otherwise only take Future Sight or the physical hit. Ice Beam hits Flying-types like Enamorus, Zapdos, Landorus, and Thundurus-T. Flamethrower can be run over Sludge Bomb or Ice Beam and can threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela. Finally, Earthquake beats Heatran, which can be problematic for Poison teams, but should only be used if Galarian Slowking is already running Flamethrower. The given EV spread lets it survive Choice Specs Psyshock from Tapu Lele after Stealth Rock damage. Sneasler and Okidogi pair excellently with Galarian Slowking, using their Fighting-type STAB moves to threaten Dark-types like Hydreigon and Ting-Lu along with specially defensive targets such as Hisuian Goodra and Blissey. They also majorly appreciate Galarian Slowking's Future Sight helping form a devastating combination that can break past physical walls like Mega Venusaur and Great Tusk with ease. Sneasler also appreciates Galarian Slowking as a safe target to pivot into with U-turn against special attackers like Thundurus-T. Alolan Muk complements Galarian Slowking by threatening Ghost-types such as Blacephalon and Gholdengo along with serving as a safe switch-in against Psychic-types like Tapu Lele, which can otherwise break past Galarian Slowking with Psyshock. Crobat provides a solid Ground Immunity and entry hazard removal in Defog, and it also helps deal with foes like Ogerpon-W and Mega Gallade that threaten Galarian Slowking. Mega Venusaur helps by removing problematic Ground- and Water-types like Mamoswine and Dondozo.</p>"

Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's strongest STAB move, and its priority allows it to revenge kill faster threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Close Combat is Mega Scizor's strongest coverage move, enabling it to more easily beat Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. After a Swords Dance boost, Mega Scizor becomes strong enough to 2HKO Celesteela, opposing Mega Scizor, and physically defensive Gastrodon. Knock Off removes essential items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T and Black Sludge from Toxapex, and it also provides Mega Scizor with strong coverage against Aegislash, Skeledirge, and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Trailblaze can also be used to 2HKO bulky Water- or Ground-type Pokemon most other Steel-types struggle with such as Mega Swampert and Gastrodon, as well as potentially OHKO Azumarill and Rotom-W after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. 132 Speed EVs are invested in order for Mega Scizor to outspeed Jolly Azumarill as well as Hydreigon and Urshifu-S after a Trailblaze. Heatran and Ferrothorn are great teammates because they are able to set entry hazards to wear down incoming foes, and Heatran also has the added benefit of providing a Fire immunity thanks to its ability. Ferrothorn can also provide passive healing for Mega Scizor via the use of Leech Seed. In return, Mega Scizor is able to threaten faster Fighting-types such as Sneasler and Iron Valiant with Bullet Punch. Gholdengo is able to threaten Toxapex and Tapu Lele, and it along with Aegislash can also hinder foes with Toxic and Thunder Wave respectively if they are running defensive sets, easing set up for Mega Scizor. In return, Mega Scizor can remove Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Moltres. Specially defensive Celesteela is an excellent special wall that can wall Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Altaria, while also being able to spread status and use Leech Seed to aid Mega Scizor in its sweeping. As Mega Scizor is more vulnerable to hazards compared to other Steel-types, it appreciates hazard removal from the likes of Corviknight, Excadrill, and Iron Treads. Excadrill and Iron Treads also have the added merit of handling Fire-types like Victini and Ogerpon-H. Excadrill can also bypass Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce and inflict poison on it thanks to Mold Breaker, while Iron Treads can threaten both Landorus formes with Ice Spinner.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Scizor's neutrality to Ground and Fighting and role compression as a wall and sweeper make it a formidable asset for Steel teams. Knock Off hinders predicted checks that Mega Scizor lures in on the switch such as Celesteela, Porygon2, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, notably removing Heavy-Duty Boots to enable entry hazards that are characteristic of Steel teams. The first EV spread with an Adamant nature maximizes damage output, notably OHKOing Hisuian Lilligant, Meowscarada, and Kyurem with +2 Bullet Punch; it also outspeeds Adamant Azumarill and has the rest invested in HP to optimize mixed bulk. The second EV spread with an Impish nature also outspeeds Adamant Azumarill and avoids a 2HKO after Stealth Rock from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat and Adamant Mega Swampert's Earthquake, yet requires a layer of Spikes to OHKO Hisuian Lilligant and Meowscarada with +2 Bullet Punch. Mega Scizor is extremely vulnerable to Fire-type moves, so Heatran is a solid partner to mitigate this weakness. As Mega Scizor can often have a difficult time sweeping because Bullet Punch is easy to resist, Excadrill and Iron Treads make an offensive core with Mega Scizor, as they can pressure the Fire-, Electric- and Steel-types that would check it; notably, the former can additionally handle Rotom-W and the latter offensively checks Landorus. Ferrothorn and Hisuian Goodra are also options to further complement and handle Water-types for it. Gholdengo can wear down the opposing team as it stallbreaks past foes such as Toxapex, Mega Sableye, and Hisuian Goodra, easing Mega Scizor's sweep late-game; it also acts as an additional check for Fighting-types Mega Scizor can't consistently switch into such as Iron Valiant. Corviknight can remove entry hazards, increasing the longevity of Mega Scizor and the rest of its team, as well as pivot to it with U-turn to ease switching. Skarmory is also an alternative that can set Spikes, letting Mega Scizor reach OHKOes that it wouldn't otherwise.</p>"

After a Swords Dance boost, Scizor becomes a powerful revenge killer that deals with fast frail threats like Iron Valiant, Mega-Diancie, and Sneasler using Bullet Punch. Close Combat is mandatory coverage, being able to take out Ferrothorn, Hisuian Goodra, and Blissey after a boost. Knock Off handles Psychic- and Ghost- types like Jirachi, Slowbro, and Gholdengo while hindering walls that switch in. Alternatively, Trailblaze increases Scizor's mediocre Speed while taking on Water- and Ground- types like Azumarill, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Metal Coat is the optimal item for the boost to Bullet Punch it provides without the downside of Life Orb recoil, which secures OHKOs on Pokemon like Latios and Mega Lopunny at +2. 216 Speed EVs let it outspeed base 100 Pokemon after -1 from Sticky Webs or a single Trailblaze boost. Sticky Web is often provided by Galvantula, which also takes care of Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex that Scizor struggles with. Araquanid handles Fire- types like Volcarona and Blacephalon while also providing Sticky Web support and a burn immunity. Volcarona appreciates Scizor's removal of walls and Choice Scarf users like Nihilego while in return dealing with bulky physical walls such as Zapdos or Great Tusk. Kleavor sets Stealth Rock, which chips down opposing teams into boosted Bullet Punch range while also handling Fire- types like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Finally Mega Pinsir removes Fighting- types and can more easily pick off teams that have been weakened by Scizor's powerful priority move.</p>"

With Mental Herb, it isn't scared to set up entry hazards in front of common Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Zeraora. Encore shuts down setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and bulky walls such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn, locking them into their setup and recovery moves. Shuckle can generate momentum after setting up hazards by using Final Gambit, allowing teammates such as Shell Smash Omastar, Mega Diancie, and Choice Band Tyranitar to come in and start exerting pressure. Toxic can also be used to punish more passive Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Mega Diancie can bounce back any hazards or status moves directed at Shuckle and provides amazing offensive pressure and coverage against Poison-, Steel-, and Dragon-types. Sticky Web allows Choice Band Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Specs Gholdengo and Nidoking, both of which are threats to Rock. Omastar and Minior benefit from Stealth Rock breaking potential Focus Sashes and are great partners to have in the Grass and Fighting matchups. Thanks to Sticky Web, Omastar outspeeds Sand Rush Excadrill after one shell smash and +1 Spe Nihilego outspeeds Barraskewda in the rain. Power Herb Nihilego is able to sweep teams as well with Meteor Beam and amazing coverage.

Thick Fat coupled with Eviolite gives Piloswine tremendous bulk, with which it can check dangerous Fire-type threats to Ice such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y by disposing of them with Rock Slide. 12 EVs in Attack guarantees an OHKO on offensive Volcarona. Another one of Piloswine's amazing traits is its Ground typing, which makes it a great asset in the Electric matchup by preventing a Volt Switch onslaught while also letting it hit Electric-types super effectively with STAB Earthquake. Toxic is an option to put defensive switch-ins such as Skeledirge and Rotom-W on a timer, helping Piloswine's teammates overpower them, but Roar is an alternative choice to force out threats that may use it to set up, such as Mega Scizor, and to rack up hazard damage from its Stealth Rock and Cloyster's Spikes to wear down threats such as Urshifu-R and Mega Venusaur. Piloswine appreciates Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil, which let it wall the opposition more easily. Piloswine is, however, extremely vulnerable to Water-types, so partnering it with Kyurem or Arctozolt is appreciated, as they can easily break Water teams. Substitute Baxcalibur also threatens Poison teams, which can cripple Piloswine with Toxic. Weavile with a Z-Crystal is also a good Knock Off absorber for Piloswine, as losing Eviolite ruins Piloswine; Weavile also forces immense progress by removing key items from Celesteela and Skeledirge, which become susceptible to Stealth Rock afterwards, or outright breaking through them with a Z-Move. Galarian Darmanitan and Shell Smash Cloyster can threaten Steel teams with Flare Blitz and Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Fire, respectively. The Stealth Rocks and Toxic spread by Piloswine also accentuates the breaking power of teammates such as Swords Dance or Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Belly Drum Cetitan. IronPress Avalugg and defensive Cloyster with Hidden Power Fire are also good partners in being able to shut down Mega Scizor. Avalugg, Articuno, and Cloyster are also capable of removing entry hazards, with the latter two also being able to pivot in Piloswine with U-turn and Teleport, respectively.</p>"

Paired with Whirlpool, it has an easier time overcoming these threats, turning 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Mirror Coat allows Galarian Corsola to nab a surprise OHKO on Regieleki and Blacephalon, both of which deal too much damage for it to handle with just Night Shade. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp makes Galarian Corsola a solid check to physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and provides chip damage, similar to Whirlpool. Strength Sap gives Galarian Corsola a form of recovery and allows it to deal with Choice Band Excadrill and Mega Swampert. As Galarian Corsola is reliant on Eviolite to be a competent wall, Knock Off absorbers like Mega Sableye and Gholdengo with a Z crystal are appreciated. Mega Sableye also spreads burn on the opposing team, which helps Galarian Corsola take on physical attackers, and Gholdengo prevents Defog users like Corviknight from removing the hazards Galarian Corsola sets. Setup sweepers like Sinistcha, Mimikyu, and Ceruledge love Galarian Corsola's ability to handle Landorus, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie, and in return, they deal with Mega Swampert, Alolan Muk, and Toxapex, which Galarian Corsola struggles with.

Ice Punch is an alternative as well, as it threatens to OHKO foes such as Landorus and Gliscor. Additionally, Tyranitar is able to set up sand, aiding teammates such as Garganacl, Cradilly, and Nihilego with a Special Defense boost. A Jolly nature allows Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Specs Iron Valiant outside of Electric Terrain and Mega Diancie while Sticky Web is up and OHKO both with Heavy Slam. This does, however, cause a loss of power, making the Steel and Poison matchups much harder by not 2HKOing Corviknight and Mega Venusaur with Stone Edge. Shuckle can set up Sticky Web, which allows Tyranitar to outspeed threats such as Gholdengo and Nidoking. Mega Diancie is a great special wallbreaker that Tyranitar needs on its team to deal with the Fighting-types that threaten it such as Kommo-o and Great Tusk. Cradily gives Tyranitar a switch-in to Ground-type moves that can reliably take hits and proceed to use Recover to maintain its health while also setting up Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Terrakion pairs amazingly with Tyranitar by taking the physical wallbreaking load off of Tyranitar and splitting it between the two powerhouses. Terrakion is able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny while also benefitting from Tyranitar's Pursuit trapping ability. As a wall, Garganacl appreciates Tyranitar removing Leftovers from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Ting-Lu. Ogerpon-C creates additional pressure in the Ground and Water matchups, complementing Tyranitar's power with great coverage. Nihilego helps with Tyranitar's weakness to Fairy-types, providing great Special Defense in sand, as well as Poison coverage. Although Tyranitar has great bulk, Rhyperior and Omastar are better checks to Scizor, a huge threat to the Rock type. Rhyperior's great bulk and ability allow it to beat Scizor, while Omastar's neutrality to Steel-type moves allows it to beat Scizor one-on-one.</p>"

Psychic and Earth Power threaten Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Nidoking; Earth Power also targets Steel-types like Archaludon and non-Air Balloon Heatran and, when boosted by Groundium Z, allows Celebi to heavily damage Alolan Muk and OHKO Hisuian Goodra at +2 after one layer of Spikes. Recover increases Celebi's longevity, providing it with multiple setup opportunities against bulkier teams. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fire allows Celebi to break through Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn after a boost while also dealing significant damage to other foes like Skarmory and Celesteela. Ferrothorn provides entry hazard support that makes it easier for Celebi to break through bulky foes while also handling physical attackers like Weavile, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Ogerpon-C, with its Rock typing and Sturdy ability, makes for an excellent teammate that can threaten Flying-, Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-types like Tornadus-T, Volcarona, the Mega Charizard formes, and Kyurem. Mega Venusaur can aid Celebi in wearing down or eliminating Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn with its great options in Leech Seed, Hidden Power Fire, and Earth Power, enabling Celebi to forgo Hidden Power Fire for Recover; Mega Venusaur also threatens common Fairy-types like Mimikyu, Tapu Koko, and Alolan Ninetales. Choice Scarf Meowscarada can take on faster threats like Greninja and Blacephalon as well as aid against Dragon-types like Latias and Dragonite. Hisuian Lilligant, Breloom, and Whimsicott are excellent partners for their ability to threaten Dark-types; Hisuian Lilligant and Breloom can handle Hydreigon and Ting-Lu, while Whimsicott, in addition to Hydreigon, also beats Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz. Additionally, Breloom can also use Mach Punch to revenge kill faster Dark-types like Meowscarada and Greninja, while Whimsicott can provide Defog support and handle the aforementioned Dragon-types.</p>"

Giga Drain threatens Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types like Hippowdon, Barraskewda, and Mega Diancie while keeping Celebi healthy. Earth Power allows Celebi to hit Fire-, Steel-, Poison-, and Electric-types like non-Air Balloon Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, Toxapex, and Alolan Raichu. Colbur Berry is an alternative option that allows Celebi to survive Dark-type moves from threats like Hisuian Samurott and Mega Sharpedo, letting it heavily chip or outright remove them if at +2. The EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Electric Terrain-boosted Rising Voltage from Magnet Regieleki and Ice Punch from Mega Swampert while letting Celebi outspeed Mega Swampert outside of rain. Iron Boulder, with its Rock typing, incredible Speed tier, and diverse coverage options, proves to be a valuable partner for Celebi, dispatching Flying-, Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-types such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, Volcarona, and Kyurem. Iron Boulder can also equip itself with a Choice Scarf to eliminate faster threats like Weavile, Mega Aerodactyl, and common Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Blacephalon. Victini can break through Steel- and Bug-types like Gholdengo, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor and special walls like Alolan Muk when using a Choice Band set. In return, Celebi handles pesky Ground- and Water-types like Hippowdon, Rotom-W, and Slowbro for them. Mega Gallade and Choice Specs Tapu Lele eliminate Dark-types like Hydreigon, Mega Tyranitar, and Galarian Moltres. Furthermore, Mega Gallade can remove Steel- and Ice-types like Corviknight and Kyurem as well as special walls like Chansey and Alolan Muk, while Tapu Lele, in addition to Kyurem, also threatens other Dragon-types like Latios. Slowbro can take advantage of its high physical bulk, Water typing, and access to Scald to handle Fire- and Steel-types like Cinderace and Mega Scizor while also assisting Celebi against Ground teams by dealing with Excadrill and Mamoswine. Slowbro can also run a Colbur Berry alongside Body Press and Thunder Wave to either remove or cripple Dark-types like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Weavile, or it can go itemless to counter Ceruledge; this also lets it take reduced damage from Knock Off. Specially defensive Jirachi can switch into threats like Choice Specs Latios and Kyurem while also setting Stealth Rock and providing a pivoting option with U-turn. Both teammates are also adept at spreading paralysis. In return, Slowbro appreciates Celebi handling threats like Choice Specs Tapu Koko and Ogerpon-W, while Jirachi benefits from the removal of the aforementioned Ground-, Water-, and Electric-types. Celebi also benefits from its teammates removing Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Sneasler.</p>"

Earthquake nails Water-resistant foes like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Water Absorb Clodsire as well as Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Iron Hands, and Zeraora. Furthermore, with sufficient chip damage, it's capable of overwhelming Ferrothorn and Gastrodon. Waterfall is nicely complemented by rain as it outdamages Ice Punch when combatting Flying-types like Zapdos and Corviknight. Waterfall is notably preferred over Liquidation due to its higher PP and potential to break through walls, such as the aforementioned Corviknight, via flinching. Ice Punch targets Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragonite, Latias, and Tapu Bulu due to their resistances to Mega Swampert's STAB combination. Flip Turn allows Mega Swampert to escape unfavorable situations and form pivoting cores with teammates like Pelipper, Greninja, and Barraskewda. Alternatively, Stealth Rock may be used to take advantage of Mega Swampert's ability to force switches, while other options such as Stone Edge and Toxic may be used to threaten Mantine, Pelipper, and Rotom-W which wall it otherwise. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Choice Scarf Thundurus-T, Volcarona after one Quiver Dance, and opposing Mega Swampert. However, an Adamant nature may be used for higher damage rolls against Kommo-o, Mega Venusaur, and Gastrodon. Pelipper is a perfect teammate, as it provides rain with Drizzle, slowly pivots into Mega Swampert with U-turn, and removes entry hazards with Defog. In return, Mega Swampert provides an immunity against the aforementioned Electric-type moves and threatens Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Toxapex provides a buffer against Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada as well as Kommo-o while also providing Toxic Spikes to enhance Mega Swampert's wallbreaking capabilities. Furthermore, Toxapex appreciates Mega Swampert forcing out Heatran and Gholdengo, as they easily take advantage of Toxapex's passivity. Urshifu-R and Barraskewda deal with threats like Ferrothorn, Hydreigon, and Kyurem, while Mega Swampert removes Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire. Other Swift Swim users like Basculegion-F and Barraskewda take on threats like Slowbro and Tapu Koko outside of rain, respectively. Greninja provides speed control outside of rain and beats Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Alolan Ninetales with Gunk Shot as well as overloads shared Water-resistant foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur with a Choice Specs set. Empoleon is a good teammate as it can free up Mega Swampert's Stealth Rock moveslot and switch into Freeze-Dry users like Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

Roar allows Swampert to phaze out setup sweepers that it can take hits from such as Mega Charizard X and Galarian Moltres; notably, the both of them are especially vulnerable to Stealth Rock due to their lack of recovery. Flip Turn allows Swampert to take advantage of its low Speed to bring in a teammate safely. Greninja serves as a great partner, as not only can it threaten Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Sinistcha, and Ogerpon-W, but it also takes on a myriad of threats like Great Tusk, Mega Latias, and Slowbro with its coverage. Toxapex forms a defensive partnership with Swampert, as it can stack hazards with Toxic Spikes as well as take on Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada, Tapu Bulu, and Azumarill, while Swampert can switch into a predicted Electric-type attack from Regieleki and Mangezone. Ogerpon-W appreciates Swampert taking on Poison-types it dislikes like Toxapex and Water Absorb Clodsire, and in return, it eases the Ground matchup by taking out the Landorus formes and Excadrill. Pelipper provides a Ground immunity, and it takes on Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Keldeo; Barraskewda can also be used alongside Pelipper so that rain teams can opt to use this version over Mega Swampert instead. Hisuian Samurott can also stack entry hazards with Ceaseless Edge, and it assists in the Ghost matchup by taking on the likes of Sinistcha and non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Keldeo and Urshifu-R deal with Kyurem, which can remove Swampert with Freeze-Dry.</p>"

Hurricane under rain is able to consistently hit Grass- and Fighting-types like Mega Venusaur and Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Scald punishes switch-ins like Iron Hands and Zeraora with a potential bur, and it also targets Hippowdon. U-turn in tandem with its low Speed allows Pelipper to bring in its teammates safely. With 9 Speed IVs, Pelipper underspeeds Hippowdon, guaranteeing it sets up rain after Hippowdon's sand. Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Kingdra appreciate Pelipper's rain, as it activates their Swift Swim to outspeed and threaten Tapu Koko, Alolan Raichu, and Mega Latias, respectively. Ogerpon-W is another beneficiary of rain, as it further boosts the power of Ivy Cudgel. Notably, Ivy Cudgel now outright OHKOes Thundurus-T, has a high chance of OHKOing Alolan Muk after Stealth Rock damage, and guarantees a 2HKO on Galarian Weezing when unboosted. Urshifu-R and Keldeo can deal with Kyurem and bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Empoleon. Toxapex sets up Toxic Spikes or spreads poison directly with Toxic to aid Pelipper's teammates; it is also great in the Fairy matchup, handling the likes of Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, and Azumarill.</p>"

Metal Burst lets Mega Sableye reduce its passivity by damaging foes more than Knock Off, notably OHKOing Kommo-o after withstanding Clangorous Soulblaze and Mega Diancie. Protect is an alternative that lets it safely Mega Evolve when it's threatened by foes such as Mega Diancie and Mega Lopunny, ensuring that it can block entry hazards mid-game with Magic Bounce and easing its prediction against Choice-locked foes such as Galarian Darmanitan and Enamorus. The given EV spread allows Mega Sableye to avoid an OHKO from Mega Diancie's Moonblast and a 2HKO from Excadrill's Earthquake. Mega Sableye is forced out by Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Tapu Koko, so Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu are good partners to mitigate this weakness; the latter also sets hazards up, which Mega Sableye can maintain by blocking Rapid Spin from Excadrill, Iron Treads, and Terapagos. Mandibuzz complements Mega Sableye by checking Fighting-types it can't consistently handle such as Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk and providing hazard control as further backup if Mega Sableye is unable to keep entry hazards off of its side of the field. As Mega Sableye cripples foes throughout a battle, setup sweepers such as Hydreigon and Weavile and cleaners like Choice Scarf Meowscarada find easier setup opportunities to KO foes on the other team.</p>"

Due to Sableye's meager HP and need for longevity, Recover's a must-have utility option, further enabling Metal Burst. Protect allows Sableye to Mega Evolve safely, ensuring it can utilize Magic Bounce later into the game. Metal Burst retaliates against Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, while Dazzling Gleam eliminates Mega Sableye's passivity in front of Hydreigon and Roaring Moon. Will-O-Wisp in conjunction with Prankster renders physical attackers like Mega Gallade, Dragonite, and Mamoswine less threatening. The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Nidoking's Earth Power, assuming Mega Sableye uses Knock Off after the first Earth Power. Mimikyu threatens Dark-types such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Moltres, and opposing Mega Sableye. Gholdengo checks Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant as well as preventing foes from removing entry hazards set by Froslass and Galarian Corsola. Blacephalon handles opposing Gholdengo and utilizes Choice Scarf to clean through Steel, Ghost, and Psychic teams once Heatran, Mega Sableye, and Galarian Slowking, respectively, are removed. Skeledirge has great synergy with Mega Sableye, appreciating the prevention of opposing Stealth Rock and in return walling Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

Heat Rock allows Torkoal's sun to support teammates for longer, but Heavy-Duty Boots can also be used so that Torkoal can switch in more freely without fearing entry hazards and have an easier time removing them. Yawn is an option that pairs well with Stealth Rock because it forces switches. Volcarona makes for a great partner, as it appreciates the sun Torkoal sets so that its Flamethrower can hit new benchmarks, notably OHKOing Landorus and 2HKOing Empoleon and Alolan Muk after a boost, as well as now being able to survive a Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Greninja to set up one Quiver Dance. In return, Volcarona is able to deal with Fighting- and Ground-types such as Kommo-o, Swampert, and Great Tusk thanks to its coverage. Cinderace threatens Normal- and Rock-type foes such as Porygon2, Ogerpon-C, and Hisuian Arcanine and can don a Choice Scarf to dispatch speedy threats such as Choice Scarf Iron Treads and Tapu Lele. Heatran deals with problematic walls such as Toxapex and Archaludon by trapping them with Magma Storm and removing them with Earth Power as well as Diancie with Flash Cannon. Heatran also runs Stealth Rock so that Torkoal can opt to use another option such as Yawn.

Thunderbolt wears down Celesteela and Mantine more efficiently. Ice Beam is another option and allows Mega Latias to OHKO Mega Garchomp and Landorus without needing boosts, making it an effective check to these threats. Alternatively, Refresh helps Mega Latias shrug off Toxic from threats like Clodsire and Tapu Koko, preventing it from being stalled out. Using Mega Latias can be a liability due to not being able to run the Dragon-immune Mega Altaria, so teammates like Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra that can stave off Dragon-type attacks are mandatory. Archaludon also helps Mega Latias by setting Stealth Rock to chip down Celesteela and Corviknight, taking on Triple Axel users like Meowscarada and Weavile, and being able to check the aforementioned Mega Altaria. Hisuian Goodra deals with Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele, checks Gholdengo and Heatran, and annoys Celesteela and Ferrothorn with its coverage and ability in Sap Sipper.

Latios's strongest STAB move is its devastating Draco Meteor, destroying dangerous threats like Kyurem and Archaludon. Luster Purge covers bulky Fighting- and Poison-types such as Buzzwole and Toxapex while the high Special Defense drop chance gives Latios the potential to break through special walls that take neutral damage from Psychic-type moves like Gastrodon. Thunderbolt is an option for Water- and Flying-types like Empoleon and Celesteela, which is complemented by Ice Beam for threats like Sinistcha, Landorus, and Gliscor. Aura Sphere is an option on Latios for Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn that otherwise wall it. Trick cripples common switch-ins like Blissey, Alolan Muk, and Galarian Slowking by locking them into one move. Flip Turn can be used to preserve momentum by allowing Latos to switch out of counters such as Tapu Lele. while also preventing it from being Pursuit trapped by Dark-types like Alolan Muk that can switch in on its STAB moves. For teammates, Latios appreciates both Steel-types Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra switching into Bug-, Ice-, and Dragon-type attacks while providing Stealth Rock and Toxic support, respectively. Archaludon checks Weavile and Mimikyu, while Hisuian Goodra covers Tapu Koko, Greninja, and Tapu Fini. Latios in return removes Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Keldeo that threaten them. Mega Altaria provides a Dragon immunity and a Dark resistance, dealing with Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Garchomp removes Steel-types like Heatran and punishes physical attackers like Scizor with Rocky Helmet while providing Stealth Rock and Spikes. Garchomp and Mega Altaria also benefit from Latios defeating physical walls such as Mega Venusaur and Skarmory. Kommo-o benefits from Latios's ability to break through Poison-types while covering Dark- and Steel-types like Mega Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo for Latios. Roaring Moon is a strong Choice Scarf user, outspeeding and removing threats like Enamorus and Latias. Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Mega Altaria also crucially break through special walls like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra, benefiting Latios further.</p>"

Stealth Rock is useful to wear down pivots and exert more offensive pressure against Flying, Poison, and Water teams. U-turn allows Jirachi to serve as a pivot to switch in its offensive teammates. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used to heal its teammates back to full health and remove status. With 124 Speed EVs, Jirachi can outspeed threats such as Mega Tyranitar and Mamoswine to fire off Iron Head or switch out with U-turn. Mega Gallade is a great offensive teammate for Jirachi, as it can threaten out Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, and Heatran. Victini is an offensive pivot that poses a threat to Grass- and Bug-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Mega Pinsir while also taking advantage of Steel-types that pivot into Jirachi. Slowbro forms a defensive pair with Jirachi to wall physical attackers like Cinderace and non-Choice Band Excadrill.

Deoxys-S appreciates Mega Gallade's ability to remove Dark- and Steel-types like Ting-Lu, Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Ferrothorn and special walls like Blissey and Articuno. In return, Deoxys-S can eliminate Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mega Aerodactyl, and Zapdos.

Defog removes entry hazards, allowing its teammates to switch in more safely, and it also removes opponents' dual screens to ease the Fairy matchup. Alternatively, Empoleon can run Stealth Rock to wear down foes over time to aid its offensive partners. Flash Cannon targets Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele. Knock Off targets Ghost- and Psychic-types like Hisuian Zoroark and Jirachi while removing items from foes that rely on them like Rotom-W and Corviknight. Alternatively, Flip Turn allows Empoleon to take advantage of its low Speed by acting as a slow pivot to bring its teammates in safely. Pelipper pairs well with Empoleon, as the two of them form a pivoting core, and it appreciates Empoleon taking on Tapu Lele and Kyurem. In return, Pelipper can run Defog so that Empoleon can choose to run Stealth Rock instead. Rain-boosted sweepers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda appreciate Empoleon taking on Kyurem's Freeze-Dry and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, respectively, and in return, it provides an Electric immunity and can sweep under rain. Urshifu-R and Keldeo appreciate Empoleon setting up Stealth Rock and challenging Fairy-types; in return, the two of them challenge Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Hisuian Goodra. Choice Specs Greninja, with its great coverage, handles a myriad of threats to Empoleon such as non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and the Landorus formes, and it appreciates Defog and Stealth Rock support in return. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott can stack Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, and it takes on Ghost- and Psychic-types if Empoleon forgoes Knock Off.

Earthquake allows Garchomp to threaten Steel- and Fire-types like Gholdengo, Hisuian Goodra, and Mega Charizard X. Dragon Tail phazes out setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Mega Latias, and Galarian Moltres, dealing a decent amount of chip damage; Roar may be used instead to force Fairy-types out. Fire Blast threatens Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Corviknight. Alternatively, a combination of Spikes and Stealth Rock in conjunction with Dragon Tail or Roar enable Garchomp to cause an incredible buildup of damage. Toxic may be used instead, as it puts opposing walls such as Ting-Lu, Staraptor, and Mandibuzz on a timer. Rocky Helmet in conjunction with Rough Skin provides even more chip damage on top of the entry hazards, heavily damaging foes with multi-hit moves such as Urshifu-R, Meowscarada, and Weavile while also punishing U-turn and Flip Turn from Sneasler and Barraskweda, respectively. The given EV spread permits Garchomp to outpace Pokemon with a base Speed of 100 like Mega Charizard X, Jirachi, and Volcarona while maintaining maximum defensive bulk. Kyurem capatalizes greatly on Garchomp's hazards, appreciating special walls such as Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Alolan Muk being worn down. In return, Kyurem removes Flying-types like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz and greatly weakens Mega Sableye, preventing it from repeatedly switching in to bounce back hazards being set by Garchomp. Hisuian Goodra provides a Fairy- and Ice-type neutrality, combating foes such as Tapu Koko, Alolan Ninetales, and, notably, Mega Diancie, which also hinders Garchomp's ability to stack hazards. Mega Altaria offers a much-valued immunity to Dragon-type moves, threatening Roaring Moon, Walking Wake, Kommo-o, and Latios while also cherishing Garchomp's hazards and ability to check Poison- and Steel-types like Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Iron Treads. Mega Latias is incredibly threatening in the Flying matchup due to its BoltBeam coverage, though it struggles against Celesteela, while also easily sweeping teams lacking Galarian Moltres via Stored Power and Calm Mind. Roaring Moon is a versatile teammate capable of handling multiple roles; a Choice Scarf set allows it to threaten Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, Alolan Ninetales, and Tapu Lele via Iron Head, while Dragon Dance sets can overpower physically defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Celesteela. Kommo-o is a great setup sweeper that removes pesky walls such as Porygon2 and Mega Scizor and is a massive threat to opposing Dragon teams. Both Roaring Moon and Kommo-o value Garchomp's entry hazards, with the latter also appreciating the removal of Clodsire. Choice Scarf Latias and Latios are excellent speed control options due to their ability to force switches in the Dragon matchup, luring out Hisuian Goodra for Garchomp.

Fire Fang targets Pokemon like Corviknight and Celesteela that wall Garchomp's STAB combination and can also OHKO Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance. It should also be noted that Garchomp can benefit from not Mega Evolving immediately, since the base forme's higher Speed lets it outrun threats like Kyurem, Urshifu-R, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele after a Scale Shot. With the chip damage from the Stealth Rock and sand that Hippowdon sets up, Mega Garchomp, after a Swords Dance boost, can use a Sand Force-enhanced Earthquake to take out neutral targets like Mega Venusaur and Mega Scizor. Excadrill provides speed control with Sand Rush and removes Ice- and Fairy types like Enamorus and Weavile, clearing the way for Mega Garchomp to remove walls like Slowbro and Celesteela that check Excadrill. Landorus is another good partner because it complements Mega Garchomp's physical strength with its powerful special attacks, which let it remove threats like Kyurem and Tapu Bulu with Focus Blast and Sludge Wave.

Knock Off hinders defensive switch-ins like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex by removing their Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Low Kick targets foes like Heatran, Iron Treads, and Mega Tyranitar. Kyurem, Alolan Ninetales, and Arctozolt are excellent partners for their ability to break through bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Swampert, which Weavile struggles against. Arctozolt, Galarian Darmanitan, Cetitan, and Kyurem can also wear down or eliminate Steel-types like Skarmory, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Archaludon, allowing Weavile to clean up late-game. Cloyster and Piloswine set entry hazards, which, in conjunction with Weavile's Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots, can wear down bulky foes. Additionally, Cloyster also provides entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, increasing Weavile's survivability, while Piloswine can check Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran.</p>"

Hidden Power Fire is essential for dealing as much damage as possible before Klefki or Excadrill set too many entry hazards or break Magnezone after enough attacks. Flash Cannon obliterates Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele. Substitute allows Magnezone to block Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Celesteela, and it also provides an opportunity to secure a second OHKO against Fairy teams after trapping and eliminating Klefki. Volt Switch helps Magnezone to maintain momentum and chip away at Corviknight before it inevitably uses U-turn turns, while Thunderbolt 2HKOes Celesteela. The first EV spread lets Magnezone survive two Moonblasts from Choice Specs Tapu Lele while still being able to outspeed Skarmory. Maximum Special Attack and Speed can be considered, as this lets Magnezone outspeed and OHKO most variants of Mega Scizor before getting OHKOed by it. As Magnezone is able to deal with Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Excadrill, which take Electric-type attacks with ease, Rising Voltage users like Regieleki and Alolan Raichu greatly benefit from having Magnezone as a teammate. In return, these teammates provide speed control, dealing with Iron Valiant, Volcarona, and Ogerpon-W. Tapu Koko benefits from Celesteela getting removed, as this means it's able to use Hidden Power Ice more freely against Flying teams, and it deals with Kommo-o and Mega Gallade. Zapdos and Rotom-W are great Ground-immune teammates to fall back on after Magnezone's Air Balloon is popped, and Rotom-W appreciates the removal of Mold Breaker Excadrill, which otherwise threatens it. Raging Bolt becomes even scarier once Steel-types are removed by Magnezone, allowing it to spam Draco Meteor with impunity. Iron Hands and Zeraora appreciate Magnezone removing Klefki in the Fairy matchup, preventing it from setting its dual screens, and trapping Protect scouters like Ferrothorn in Steel teams, which allows them to play more aggressively against these teams. Magnezone also is a slow pivot that brings in these wallbreakers, which is greatly appreciated by most Electric-types.</p>"

Knock Off removes important items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite and Leftovers from Corviknight. Taunt shuts down entry hazard attempts as well as attempts to remove its teammates' hazards with Defog. Roost grants Gliscor a form of longevity on top of Poison Heal. 244 HP and 20 Defense EVs allow it to survive a V-create from Choice Band Victini, while 8 Speed EVs outspeed Modest Raging Bolt. Corviknight and Mantine remove hazards with Defog so Gliscor can switch in more safely. Additionally, Corviknight provides slow pivoting and threatens Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie, while Mantine handles Water-types like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert. Thundurus-T takes pressure off Gliscor by providing an additional Electric immunity; it also threatens Water- and Flying-types such as Urshifu-R, Swampert, Mantine, and Corviknight with its coverage. It appreciates Gliscor removing Clodsire and blocking entry hazard setup with Taunt. Late-game sweepers such as Mega Charizard Y and Galarian Moltres appreciate Gliscor's stallbreaking against Toxapex, Clodsire, and Heatran so they can start their own sweep.

Ice Shard helps it pick off faster Pokemon that can threaten it, such as Thundurus-T, Enamorus, and Latias. Knock Off heavily weakens Pokemon reliant on their items, such as Corviknight, Porygon2, and Celesteela, making them much easier for Mamoswine to take advantage of later on. Alternatively, Superpower is Mamoswine’s best option for beating bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Rotom-W. Landorus is an outstanding teammate for Mamoswine to have, as it can threaten physical walls Mamoswine would rather not face, such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro, and help it beat Ground-immune Pokemon such as Skarmory and Rotom-W with Gravity. Scale Shot Mega Garchomp and Sand Rush Excadrill appreciate Mamoswine wearing down bulky Pokemon such as Celesteela and Gliscor for them to clean up late-game. Ting-Lu and Hippowdon help Mamoswine do its job more effectively by setting up entry hazards, allowing it to net more KOs. They also can rack up chip damage with Whirlwind, and Hippowdon sets sand for further residual damage. Clodsire and Gastrodon can safely switch into Water-type moves that threaten Mamoswine, and they can set hazards to help its wallbreaking. Clodsire, in particular, is able to switch into Grass-type attacks from the likes of Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Ogerpon-W, and Brambleghast, and it can inflict status and set Toxic Spikes up, limiting the longevity of stall Pokemon such as Slowbro, Ting-Lu, and Blissey. Gastrodon is an excellent Water Absorb user that can ease up Water matchups for Mamoswine, as it can safely wall Water-type Pokemon such as Choice Specs Walking Wake, Dondozo, and Mega Swampert with the proper moveset to take advantage of later on.</p>"

        "description": "<p>For Fighting teams, Mega Gallade is one of the best choices, courtesy of its incredible offensive power, typing, and Speed, being the best counter to Fighting's biggest roadblock, Toxapex. Swords Dance increases Mega Gallade's power to the maximum, letting it freely overpower the likes of Mandibuzz and Celesteela. Zen Headbutt beautifully complements a Fighting-type STAB move, as it lets Mega Gallade easily break through any opposing Poison-types that may be annoying walls such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Knock Off is another tool in Mega Gallade's arsenal, which lets it take care of Psychic- and Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Slowbro, and Aegislash—and wears down Celesteela into range of Close Combat finishing it off. Triple Axel is another option to easily take care of Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Enamorus. Shadow Sneak can also be considered to pick off faster weakened threats such as Gengar, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Mega Alakazam. With all its benefits, Mega Gallade has a few checks in Skeledirge and defensive Gholdengo; hence, offensive Great Tusk and Urshifu-R are great partners in helping take these down. Defensive Great Tusk also helps in setting and removing entry hazards, which is appreciated by Mega Gallade. Mega Gallade is also easily revenge killed by faster offensive threats such as Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Blacephalon, so Assault Vest Iron Hands is a good check to stop these in their tracks and deal good damage back while also being able to pivot in Mega Gallade with Volt Switch. Breloom and Lilligant-H also helps significantly in the Water matchup against the likes of Mega Swampert and Barraskewda; they can also put opposing foes to sleep to make Gallade's setup easier. Choice Scarf Sneasler helps in the Fairy matchup against the likes of Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko while also being able to set and absorb Toxic Spikes and can U-Turn to pivot in Mega Gallade safely. Iron Valiant is also an amazing partner in the form of a specially offensive threat, complementing Mega Gallade, as it can easily take care of Mega Sableye. Choice Scarf Iron Valiant also outspeeds Mega Swampert under rain and Regieleki under Electric Terrain, making it a great revenge killer if Mega Gallade gets knocked out.</p>"

      "Swords Dance (Psychic)": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Gallade is a potent wallbreaker on Psychic teams thanks to its greatly appreciated Dark neutrality and good coverage in Knock Off and Triple Axel. Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to grab a boost on a forced switch and potentially win the game with its high base Speed and astronomical Attack after one boost. Knock Off is crucial to hit opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Slowbro and Gholdengo that would otherwise wall this set, and its item removal is always handy in breaking defensive teams reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots down with Stealth Rock damage and removing key items from Celesteela and Toxapex. Finally, Zen Headbutt does massive work against Poison teams after a single Swords Dance and deals high amounts of damage to Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Toxapex. Triple Axel is another alternative, allowing Mega Gallade to hit Flying- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Shadow Sneak can allow Mega Gallade to outspeed and take out Ghost-types such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Scarf Blacephalon that could otherwise beat it. Tapu Lele forms a wallbreaking core with Mega Gallade, as they both threaten common checks to each other. Tapu Lele beats Mega Sableye with Moonblast, while Mega Gallade crushes Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela that trouble Tapu Lele with Close Combat. Jirachi can take Fairy-type attacks such as Tapu Lele's Moonblast aimed for Mega Gallade, as well as paralyze threats and beat them down with Thunder Wave and Serene Grace-boosted Iron Head, letting Mega Gallade break through them with a timely paralysis. Finally, Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support and a safe pivot in with U-turn. Victini provides speed control with Choice Scarf and defeats Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Gholdengo that Mega Gallade is forced out by while appreciating Mega Gallade's ability to pound Heatran to dust. Deoxys-S provides entry hazard and dual screens support, which Mega Gallade can take advantage of with Knock Off and Swords Dance to break through bulkier teams. Slowbro provides crucial momentum with Teleport while also being able to annoy teams with Scald burns and Future Sight and switch in repeatedly through Regenerator. Celebi can break through troubling physical walls such as Hippowdon and Dondozo that Mega Gallade struggles to make progress against. Finally, Choice Scarf Latias can both remove entry hazards with Defog and use Healing Wish to give Mega Gallade a second chance to break through the opposing team.</p>"

Its Ground immunity and Water-type resistance make Pokemon like Mega Swampert unable to bother it; it also has access to Hydro Pump to hit annoying Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Hippowdon. Rotom-W is also a really good blanket check to Ice- and Fire-types like Mamoswine, Victini, and Galarian Darmanitan. Volt Switch provides great momentum, which is needed in hyper offense teams. In addition to providing momentum, Rotom-W has access to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, crippling foes such as Mega Garchomp and Mimikyu with Will-O-Wisp, while Toxic punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Kyurem. Defog lets Rotom-W compress roles, freeing up Zapdos to run Choice Specs, while Rotom-W prevents hazards from hurting teammates. Pain Split is another option, as it massively improves Rotom-W's longevity; however, this requires Zapdos to run Defog. The 44 invested Speed EVs ensure Rotom-W outspeeds Jolly Azumarill so that it can punish Azumarill for setting up Belly Drum with Will-O-Wisp or Volt Switch. Zapdos covers Rotom-W's weakness to Grass-types with access to Hurricane and Heat Wave, being able to OHKO the likes of Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, respectively, while also being immune to Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake. Regieleki can be used as a Rapid Spinner, removing pressure from Rotom-W to function as the only hazard removal while also luring in Ground-types that Rotom-W can punish such as Iron Treads or Great Tusk. With access to Taunt and having an amazing Speed tier, Zeraora can prevent hazards from coming up and allow Rotom-W to switch in freely and get off a strong Hydro Pump or gain a lot of momentum and Volt Switch into one of its offensive teammates. Zeraora also pressures Hydreigon and Gholdengo, which can use Rotom-W as setup fodder. Iron Hands provides the coverage and bulk against Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Volcarona, and SubRoost Kyurem that Rotom-W can't deal with while also putting a lot of pressure on Normal teams, as Rotom-W can Volt Switch against Blissey into Iron Hands and force Blissey to tank a hit or switch out. Alolan Raichu gives Rotom-W's slow Volt Switch a lot of value as it is strong but frail, being able to deal with Ice-types like Baxcalibut with Focus Blast and Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Clodsire with Psyshock. Magnezone provides a valuable Poison immunity while also checking other threats like Tapu Lele, Meowscarada, and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

Magma Storm is a powerful trapping tool against walls like Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Clodsire. Earth Power targets Fire- and Poison-types like opposing Heatran and Toxapex, which are immune to or resist Magma Storm. Flash Cannon allows Heatran to OHKO Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Enamorus, which threaten Fire teams. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice threatens Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. With Taunt, Heatran can stop recovery for foes like Toxapex and Clodsire while also denying entry hazards from these foes as well as others like Gliscor. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows it to support itself and its teammates like Ceruledge and Volcarona by wearing down the opposing team. Air Balloon provides Heatran with a Ground immunity, allowing it to deal with the aforementioned threats safely as long as its Air Balloon is intact. Torkoal and Ninetales serve as sun setters, boosting the power of Heatran's Magma Storm and softening Water-type moves. Torkoal also provides entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin and acts as an alternate Stealth Rock setter. Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X handles Dragon-types like Kyurem and Hydreigon. In return, Heatran can sponge attacks from Choice Scarf Latias. Mega Charizard Y is another sun setter that also provides a Ground immunity in case Heatran's Air Balloon has already been popped and offensively threatens Sand Rush Excadrill and Mega Swampert, which pose an immense threat to Fire teams, by resetting the weather and threatening them back with Fire Blast and Solar Beam, respectively. Z-Celebrate Victini deals with Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Iron Hands. Teammates like Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Blacephalon appreciate Heatran's ability to trap and eliminate foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Volcarona can threaten Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Hydreigon that pose problems for Heatran. Choice Scarf Iron Moth and Blacephalon serve as revenge killers; Iron Moth deals with Kommo-o, while Blacephalon threatens Mega Gallade and can eliminate the Landorus formes for Heatran if running Hidden Power Ice, allowing Heatran to run a different move. Focus Sash Ceruledge can use its Fighting immunity to switch into Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, and Sneasler, threatening them back with its STAB moves. It also serves as a wallbreaker, removing special walls like Blissey and Swampert and Rock-types like Mega Tyranitar and Iron Boulder. In return, Heatran can deny entry hazards with Taunt to keep Ceruledge's Focus Sash intact, allowing it to reliably take on the aforementioned foes. Volcanion boasts a Water immunity, which allows it switch in against Water-type attacks from Choice Specs Greninja, Azumarill, and Choice Band Barraskewda; it can also eliminate bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Ting-Lu with Steam Eruption, which can potentially burn other foes.</p>"

Earth Power threatens Poison- and Fire-types and makes Heatran an important asset against opposing Steel teams by hitting opposing Heatran. Roar lets Heatran phaze the likes of Nasty Plot Hydreigon and Z-Celebrate Victini and synergizes well with Stealth Rock to deal extra damage. Alternatively, Toxic cripples walls like Mantine and Rotom-W, as well as Pokemon that fancy switching into Heatran such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Substitute pairs well with Toxic and allows Heatran to be massively annoying against types like Steel, Electric, and Psychic by capitalizing on the many switches it forces in these matchups. Thanks to their typing and bulk, Corviknight and Celesteela are excellent teammates to check Ground- and Fighting-types like Mamoswine and Great Tusk for Heatran. Setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Z-Happy Hour Jirachi appreciate Heatran wearing down teams with burn and Toxic. Iron Treads removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and deals with Mega Charizard Y, Zeraora, and Cinderace with its Choice Scarf set.

U-turn preserves Psychic's momentum and allows Victini to switch out of Pokemon that wall it like Dragonite and Mega Altaria. Trick cripples common switch-ins such as Storm Drain Gastrodon, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Brick Break lets Victini further threaten Steel and Dark teams by hitting Heatran and Mega Tyranitar hard. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is an excellent teammate due to its ability to check Dark- and Dragon-types like Weavile, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon. It also sets up Psychic Terrain, protecting Victini from priority moves from the likes of Mimikyu and Azumarill. Jirachi and Celebi aid in Victini's wallbreaking by setting up Stealth Rock and replenishing its HP with Healing Wish. Furthermore, they form a pivot core with Victini that deals sizable chip damage while keeping momentum. Latias also provides Healing Wish support and removes entry hazards with Defog to preserve Victini's longevity. Mega Gallade and Victini can each weaken certain physical walls for the other to dispose of such as Ting-Lu and Skeledirge. Deoxys-S breaks through roadblocks like Toxapex, Garchomp, and Swampert and aids in cleaning weakened Flying and Water teams.

Focus Blast is a great form of coverage for Victini, as it can break down Dark-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Hisuian Arcanine, and Heatran; its low accuracy is also boosted by Victory Star. Alternatively, after a boost, Thunderbolt can threaten Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Greninja, Pelipper, and Mega Charizard Y. Torkoal is an excellent teammate to pair with Victini, as not only does it provide sun to boost Victini's Searing Shot, notably giving it a favorable roll to take out Tapu Lele after a boost, but it also provides entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock of its own, which breaks Sturdy of foes like Skarmory and Ogerpon-C, allowing Victini to sweep. Cinderace can break through bulky Pokemon such as Blissey with itsLibero-boosted STAB High Jump Kick while also using Court Change to remove hazards for Victini. Rotom-H provides an immunity to Ground-types with Levitate and assists by setting up dual screens, letting Victini take advantage of them to set up; it also has a niche in being another hazard removal teammate with Defog. Volcarona's Bug typing and access to Quiver Dance and Bug Buzz can check threatening Dark-types such as Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon. Mega Charizard X is a powerful wallbreak that, paired alongside Victini, can take out Dragon-type threats such as Dragonite after its Multiscale is worn down and Kyurem. Ceruledge is another offensive setup sweeper that can take out Ghost-type Pokemon like Blacephalon and a weakened Iron Boulder with Shadow Sneak.</p>"

      "Heavy-Duty Boots (Psychic)": {
        "description": "<p>Victini straps on its Heavy-Duty Boots to ignore entry hazards set by Steel, Fairy, and Flying teams, which limit its progress-making capabilities. Bolt Strike synergizes with V-create, targeting Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex and Gyarados. Substitute eases the Steel and Flying matchups by reducing the need for predictions and ensuring that Victini can deal damage to Heatran or Gliscor by scaring out Ferrothorn or Corviknight. Toxic puts walls like Porygon2 and Slowbro on a timer. Encore prevents slower setup users like Swords Dance Iron Hands and Nasty Plot Hydreigon from gaining momentum while also locking defensive foes like Corviknight and Gliscor into unfavorable moves. Power-Up Punch is effective in conjunction with Substitute, as it provides Victini with enough firepower to break through walls in subsequent turns, allowing it to OHKO Gliscor with V-create at +1 after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Slowbro and Heatran with Bolt Strike. If these extra wallbreaking capabilities are unnecessary, U-turn lets Victini pivot out of Heatran or Swampert. Victini finds it hard to break through dedicated physical walls like Hippowdon and Archaludon and Dragon-types like Dragonite, so teammates like Latios and Choice Specs Tapu Lele that deal with these are excellent teammates . Setup sweepers like Mega Gallade, Mega Latias, Iron Boulder, and Celebi can find use with Victini locking walls like Ferrothorn and Toxapex into unfavorable moves, and they also remove Landorus, Archaludon, Mega Swampert, and Ogerpon-W. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder provides speed control, hammering fast threats like Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Greninja, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon. Slowbro and Galarian Slowking are decent walls that safely pivot Victini in; Slowbro also takes on scary Ground- and Water-types like Excadrill and Barraskewda, while Galarian Slowking is able to set Toxic Spikes and check Iron Valiant and Keldeo. Jirachi provides hazards and deals with Mega Diancie and Kyurem; in return, Victini deals with Gholdengo and Mega Scizor.</p>"

While sand is active, Excadrill outspeeds Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which otherwise poses a threat to Ground-type teams. Earthquake in tandem with Choice Band 2KHOes defensive switch-ins like Archaludon and Ferrothorn. Iron Head poses a threat to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie, while hitting Pokemon with Levitate such as Latios. Rock Slide helps to target Flying- and Bug-type threats like Zapdos and Volcarona. Poison Jab is excellent coverage that deals with Grass-types like Ogerpon-W and Tapu Bulu. X-Scissor can alternatively be used to check Psychic-type switch-ins like Slowbro while still being good against Ogerpon-W. Eject Button Hippowdon is a necessary teammate to pair with Excadrill due to its ability to set sand while also being an excellent defensive pivot that sets entry hazards. Landorus, with the help of Gravity, allows Excadrill to hit Pokemon with Levitate like Rotom-W, and it is also a great answer to defensive Steel- and Flying-types like Skarmory and Corviknight once Gravity is active. It also assists in dealing with Tapu Bulu and Slowbro, depending on which move Excadrill lacks. Mamoswine helps Excadrill by wallbreaking Flying-types that it naturally cannot deal with, like Gliscor, with its powerful Ice-type STAB moves. Clodsire, with the ability Water Absorb, turns into a great specially defensive wall, as it is immune to any incoming Water-type attacks while also being an excellent means of spreading status and setting up hazards with Poison Jab and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Alternatively, Sandy Shocks is another great Gravity setter for Excadrill that can naturally check Flying- and Water-types like Pelipper and Celesteela with its Electric-type STAB moves. Sandy Shocks is also a great answer to Mega Charizard Y, as Drought activates its Protosynthesis. Great Tusk, in conjunction with Excadrill, utilizes a Choice Scarf to remove Dark-types like Weavile and Ting-Lu with its powerful Fighting-type STAB moves.</p>"

Corkscrew Crash lets Excadrill overwhelm multiple checks, OHKOing Tornadus-T when unboosted; Sinistcha, Mega Latias, and Mega Sableye at +2; and Mega Venusaur at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill compress utility by removing entry hazards for its team while also raising its Speed; Rapid Spin is also a good move to finish foes off to make Excadrill more difficult to revenge kill. Excadrill appreciates Hippowdon, which is a sand setter required to easily enable Sand Rush. Excadrill can struggle against Water-types that are immune to Ground such as Rotom-W and Pelipper, so it appreciates Gastrodon and Clodsire as allies to pivot to; in turn they can support Excadrill by setting entry hazards or crippling the aforementioned foes with status. Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, and Skarmory can also be problematic for Excadrill to deal with, so checks such as Mega Garchomp and Mamoswine are appreciated.</p>"

Alternatively, Knock Off can be used over U-turn to take advantage of Encore forcing switches by providing important item removal. The given EV spread makes Whimsicott as fast as possible while maximizing the damage of its Moonblast, letting it 2HKO Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz, and OHKO pokemon like Iron Valiant. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Whimsicott to switch in several times per match without being worn down by entry hazards. Ferrothorn is an excellent partner, since its Steel typing lets it wall Poison- and Steel-type attacks that threaten Whimsicott, and its entry hazards also pair well with Whimsicott's ability to force switches. Celebi is an excellent partner for Whimsicott thanks to its ability to threaten Poison and Steel teams that can make Whimsicott's opportunities to switch in very limited. Ogerpon-C benefits greatly from Whimsicott clearing away hazards so that it can make use of Sturdy to tank a hit it otherwise can't, and it appreciates Encore to help create setup opportunities. A Sunny Day set with Heat Rock can turn Whimsicott into a makeshift sun setter for teams that utilize Chlorophyll sweepers like Venusaur, Hisuian Lilligant, and Scovillain.</p>"

Leaf Blade is a reliable secondary STAB move that can break Toxapex and offensive Gholdengo while also dealing with Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Slowbro; however, Sleep Powder can be used instead to facilitate setting up with Victory Dance. Hustle-boosted Ice Spinner takes out Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types like Garchomp, Landorus, Dragonite, Mega Aerodactyl, and Zapdos after a Victory Dance. At +1, All Out-Pummeling can reliably KO tanks like Celesteela, Corviknight, and Iron Hands and, thanks to the Hustle boost, Fighting-resistant foes like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y while ignoring the accuracy drop. Meowscarada is a perfect teammate that appreciates Hisuian Lilligant's removal of walls like Ferrothorn and Archaludon that switch into it. Meowscarada in return threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Latios, and Latias, which Hisuian Lilligant can't touch. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are defensive partners that deal with Fairy- and Poison-types like Tapu Lele and Sneasler while wearing down teams with Leech Seed and entry hazards, respectively. Ogerpon-C threatens Flying- and Fire-types like Moltres and Torkoal while benefiting from the removal of Steel-types.

Earthquake further complements Galarian Darmanitarian's moveset to provide nearly unresisted coverage alongside its STAB Icicle Crash, OHKOing Fire-types that resist its other moves such as Ceruledge and Heatran. U-turn allows Galarian Darmanitan to gain momentum on predicted switches and wears down checks over time.

Getting Choice locked into the wrong move often forces Galarian Darmanitan to switch out; therefore, Piloswine and Articuno act as defensive partners to resort to in such scenarios. Articuno and Cloyster can provide entry hazard control to mitigate Galarian Darmanitan's weakness to Stealth Rock, raising its longevity, with the former also providing pivoting to ease Galarian Darmanitan's entry into the field.

Hyper Voice provides a complementary STAB option that shines in neutral matchups, 2HKOing Mega Venusaur and Toxapex after a boost, but Flamethrower complements Focus Blast to hit Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor. Hisuian Zoroark's sole weakness to Dark can lure in checks that can threaten a good portion of its team such as Alolan Muk and Mandibuzz. Mega Sableye is a good partner to check them in turn, and it can also prevent entry hazards from being set on its side with Magic Bounce to increase Hisuian Zoroark's longevity and allow it to bluff with Illusion further. Mimikyu discourages Dark-type attacks thanks to its Fairy typing, giving a safe option for Hisuian Zoroark to bluff as with Illusion, and an intact Disguise also lures the opposing team to expect setup and either bring in a physical wall or use utility moves such as Taunt and Will-O-Wisp that don't hinder Hisuian Zoroark as much they would Mimikyu, easing setup. Hisuian Zoroark's Illusion in general can be used to bluff as other Pokemon to lure counterplay to them that it exploits; for example, as Gholdengo, it can discourage status moves by pretending to have Good as Gold, and as Sinistcha, it can revenge kill unsuspecting foes that would normally outspeed Sinistcha.</p>"

Flamethrower hits foes it wouldn't OHKO otherwise, even after a boost, such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight after minimal chip, and opposing Hisuian Zoroark. Flamethrower alongside Focus Blast considerably eases the Steel matchup for its team, but Hyper Voice is an alternative that deals the most damage in neutral matchups, OHKOing Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T at +1 after Stealth Rock. Hyper Voice can also be used to trigger Breakneck Blitz over Z-Happy Hour to allow Hisuian Zoroark to lure in and overwhelm foes such as Keldeo, Hisuian Lilligant, and Landorus in a pinch. As Hisuian Zoroark lures in Dark-types to check it, Mega Lopunny is a solid partner to keep momentum against such foes, especially as Hisuian Zoroark can bluff as Mega Lopunny more effectively than other teammates, as both hold an item that cannot be removed by Trick or Switcheroo. Mega Lopunny also pressures special walls that Hisuian Zoroark can otherwise struggle with, such as Mega Sableye, Blissey, and Alolan Muk. Entry hazard control by Staraptor is also valuable to ensure Hisuan Zoroark's bluffing capabilities and raise its longevity; Staraptor can also provide a slow pivot to let Hisuian Zoroark come in safely. Chansey and Blissey can set Stealth Rock to let Hisuian Zoroark more easily threaten a sweep and can support it by providing safe pivoting for it with Teleport.

Hidden Power Ice deals with Flying- and Dragon-types like Gliscor, the Landorus formes, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Thunder Wave can be used over Hidden Power Ice to paralyze setup sweepers and fast threats that can't be effectively slowed down with Sticky Web, most notably Dragonite, Galarian Zapdos, Mega Aerodactyl, opposing Mega Pinsir, and Volcarona, without having to rely on Thunder to do so. This comes at the cost of losing coverage against Pokemon that resist both Thunder and Energy Ball, however. Sticky Web lowers the amount of Quiver Dance boosts needed for Volcarona to outspeed Regieleki, Unburden Sneasler, and Sand Rush Excadrill, making its setup more efficient. Sticky Web also allows choice Scarf users like Kleavor and Buzzwole to outspeed those Pokemon, limiting the amount of revenge killing options against them and improving their effectiveness against Fire- and Rock-types by taking care of Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Hisuian Arcanine, and Iron Boulder. Sticky Web gives Mega Pinsir more opportunities to use Return instead of Quick Attack to increase its damage output or Earthquake to KO Pokemon that would usually threaten it like Choice Scarf Nihilego and Hisuian Arcanine.

It's an incredible asset for Grass teams, as it can manage notable threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Melmetal. Gyro Ball capitalizes on its low Speed and threatens Fairy-types and fast foes like Alolan Ninetales and Tapu Lele. However, Iron Head provides more consistent damage against slower foes like Hatterene and is less susceptible to PP stalling, which is particularly useful against Kyurem if Ferrothorn isn't running Body Press. Depending on its teammates, Ferrothorn can opt for Stealth Rock or Spikes, as Cradily can also set up Stealth Rock, while Meowscarada has access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. With the combination of Leech Seed and Leftovers, Ferrothorn gains substantial recovery each turn, enabling it to wear down and punish switch-ins such as Heatran, Aegislash, and Nidoking. Protect serves as a scouting tool and extends the benefits of Leech Seed and Leftovers, while Body Press allows Ferrothorn to utilize its high Defense and deal significant damage to Steel- and Dark-types, like Melmetal and Weavile. When in conjunction with Gyro Ball, Body Press ensures that Substitute Kyurem won't be able to PP stall Ferrothorn, and when used with Iron Head, it guarantees an OHKO against Weavile. The featured EV spread both prevents a 2HKO from Choice Band Weavile's Icicle Crash and lets Ferrothorn almost always beat SubRoost Kyurem.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a formidable defensive core with Mega Venusaur, as the latter's typing and ability enable it to come in on Fighting- and Ice-types such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Galarian Darmanitan.

Cradily is another valuable partner, providing natural special bulk and a favorable matchup against Blacephalon and Nidoking. Offensive partners such as Rillaboom, Meowscarada, Iron Leaves, and Zarude greatly appreciate Ferrothorn weakening the opposing team with entry hazards and Leech Seed. In return, Rillaboom sets up Grassy Terrain for additional recovery and provides strong priority damage, while Choice Scarf Meowscarada can revenge kill threats such as boosted Kommo-o. Whimsicott and Celebi handle Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Kommo-o, which would otherwise pose a threat to Ferrothorn.

Power Whip minimizes passivity against the foes it's meant to check, notably OHKOing Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Knock Off provides utility by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Volcarona, Mantine, and Victini, leaving them vulnerable to the entry hazard stacking that is characteristic of Steel teams. The given EV spread with a Careful nature avoids a 2HKO from Landorus's Earth Power, with the rest invested in Defense to ease checking foes such as Mega Swampert, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Aerodactyl. The alternate EV spread with an Impish nature instead maximizes physical bulk, notably avoiding a 2HKO from Ogerpon-C's Low Kick. As Ferrothorn is easy to force out by Fire-type moves, Heatran is a solid partner to make a defensive core with it, especially because it can also set Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn to run Spikes to hazard stack further; this can be further complemented with a check to Fighting-types in Gholdengo, which keeps entry hazards set by Ferrothorn on the other side of the field by blocking hazard removal. Offensive Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill benefit from Ferrothorn wearing down and hindering the opposing team for a late-game sweep, mitigating Ferrothorn's passivity issues.

        "description": "<p>Terrakion is the ideal Choice Scarf user for Rock teams due to its high Speed stat and access to powerful coverage moves in Earthquake and Close Combat. Close Combat provides coverage against Steel-, Normal-, and Dark-types such as Heatran, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja. Earthquake does heavy damage against Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko as well as against Poison-types like Toxapex and Clodsire. Poison Jab is able to pressure Grass- and Fairy-types that Rock teams struggle to deal with, being able to OHKO Tapu Bulu and Whimsicott as well as deal high amounts of damage to Azumarill and Tapu Lele. Choice Scarf allows Terrakion to be an amazing revenge killer, outspeeding threats like Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Terrakion pairs well with Shuckle, as its Stealth Rock and Sticky Web support allows Terrakion to net more KOs and outspeed faster Pokemon like Regieleki, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Adamant Barraskewda under rain. Terrakion also pairs well with Mega Diancie, which softens the likes of Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Toxapex for Terrakion thanks to its coverage. Alolan Golem helps Terrakion with the Steel matchup by trapping Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Celesteela with its ability Magnet Pull. Nihilego is able to help with the Fairy matchup with Sludge Wave dealing big damage to Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Clefable. Tyranitar helps Terrakion by setting up sand, which boosts Terrakion's Special Defense stat, allowing it to survive Surf from Choice Scarf Greninja and Dazzling Gleam from Tapu Koko. Tyranitar also provides Pursuit support against faster Choice Scarf users such as Latias while also being able to break walls for Terrakion, allowing it to clean teams more easily.</p>"

Bleakwind Storm can be used if Tornadus-T is paired with Mega Charizard Y, as its accuracy is not affected by sun. Focus Blast grants Tornadus-T excellent neutral coverage and is able to hit most Steel- and Rock-types, like Heatran and Tyranitar, hard. Heat Wave, however, has the benefit of nailing Jirachi, Gholdengo, and Corviknight, which makes it a better option against Psychic, Ghost, and, if using Knock Off, Steel teams. In the last slot, Taunt is preferred, so Tornadus-T can safely set up on walls like Toxapex and Ting-Lu, but Knock Off's ability to cripple the likes of defensive Heatran and Galarian Slowking is worth considering. Tornadus-T has a very poor matchup against Electric-types, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, are must-haves. They're also able to lay down Stealth Rock and have access to Defog, making them incredible teammates. Similarly, Corviknight and Celesteela stomach most Ice-type attacks aimed at Tornadus-T, thanks to their bulk and Steel typing. Mega Charizard Y forms a terrifying wallbreaking duo alongside Tornadus-T that breaks down shared checks such as Heatran and Blissey. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Agility Thundurus-T greatly appreciate Tornadus-T weakening or removing walls for them. 88 HP and 8 Special Defense EVs can be used over Special Attack to ensure Tornadus-T lives an Ice Beam from Choice Scarf Greninja from full health.</p>"

Hidden Power Ice forms a great BoltBeam combination with Thunderbolt, threatening Ground-types such as the Landorus formes, Gliscor, and Garchomp, with the removal of the former two allowing it to sweep Flying teams late-game. Grass Knot handles certain Ground-types better than Hidden Power Ice such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, and physically defensive Ting-Lu. Agility allows Thundurus-T to outspeed and threaten normally faster foes such as Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and rain-boosted Mega Swampert. Gigavolt Havoc allows Thundurus-T to immediately remove bulky threats such as Rotom-W, Hatterene, and Mega Gallade as well as hindrances to its sweep like specially defensive Celesteela, Toxapex, and Ogerpon-W. Gliscor and Landorus make for great partners, as they alleviate pressure from Thundurus-T, cover the Electric matchup, and set up entry hazards. Additionally, Gliscor provides pivoting via U-turn and removes items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite and Zapdos, while Landorus's coverage allows it to cover threats such as Mega Charizard X, Tyranitar, and Tapu Bulu. Entry hazard removal from Corviknight and Mantine is appreciated by Thundurus-T due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Additionally, Corviknight and Celesteela handle Fairy- and Rock-types like Tapu Bulu, Mega Diancie, and Iron Boulder. Early-game wallbreakers such as Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y remove walls that Thundurus-T struggles with such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn. In return, they appreciate Thundurus-T's Electric immunity. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides great speed control, with it potentially being able to sweep through Dragon and Dark teams that lack a proper answer; it also provides Healing Wish support to potentially re-enable a sweep from Thundurus-T. In return, it handles Steel-types for Thundurus-T like Corviknight and Mega Scizor. Thundurus-T's ability to threaten walls such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu can also enable other sweepers like Dragonite, Mega Aerodactyl, and Galarian Moltres to start a sweep of their own.</p>"

Sludge Wave hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Celebi as well as other Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Clefable, easing the Fairy and Grass matchups due to unresisted coverage. Focus Blast breaks through Kyurem, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn. Rock Polish enables Landorus as a late-game cleaner, shutting down revenge killing abilities from faster foes like Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Greninja, while Nasty Plot allows Landorus to easily break past the likes of Blissey and Mega Sableye and become terrifying with Gravity-aided Earth Power spam. Rock Slide is another option to hit Volcarona, as it is dangerous once set up, as well as Mantine, Zapdos, and Araquanid; however, using it is very situational and forces Landorus to use an unpreferred nature. Gravity allows Landorus to ease the Flying and Steel matchups and easily spam Earth Power, increasing its potential to new heights and also supporting its teammates like Choice Band Sand Rush Excadrill. Gastrodon is a great teammate due to its ability to soak up Water-type moves from foes like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert, while Gastrodon appreciates Landorus's ability to threaten Grass-types with Sludge Wave. Mamoswine is heavily valued as a sponge for Ice-type moves due to its ability Thick Fat, taking on SubRoost Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales. In return, Mamoswine cleans up Flying teams once Landorus deals with Celesteela, Corviknight, or Skarmory. Choice Scarf or Bulk Up Great Tusk forms a great wallbreaking core, taking out threats like Triple Axel Mega Lopunny and Dragonite, while also appreciating Gravity support. Clodsire provides entry hazards to chip down walls for Landorus, switches into revenge killers like Meowscarada and Tapu Koko, and counters Volcarona with Unaware so Landorus doesn't need to use Rock Slide. Mega Steelix is valued in the Ice and Fairy matchups, taking on Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Koko, Azumarill, and Weavile. Mega Garchomp and Garchomp threaten specially defensive walls like Slowking, Blissey, and Mantine while also providing a Water neutrality with decent defensive stats.</p>"

Focus Blast targets Dark- and Ice-types like Hydreigon, Piloswine, and Kyurem and can 2HKO switch-ins like Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn. Alternatively, Rock Slide in tandem with a neutral nature and 4 Attack EVs can be used to target Flying- and Bug-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, and Volcarona; it also breaks Gholdengo's Air Balloon and hits Ice-types more accurately than Focus Blast. Sludge Wave takes on Grass- and Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Celebi. Stealth Rock wears down incoming foes so that Landorus and its teammates can wallbreak and sweep more efficiently, and it breaks Sturdy from Ogerpon-C. Alternatively, Rock Polish allows Landorus to serve as a cleaner as well by outspeeding and threatening Choice Scarf Weavile, Greninja, and Meowscarada. Tornadus-T makes for a great teammate, taking on problematic Grass- and Fighting-types such as Ogerpon-C, Hisuian Lilligant, and Mega Gallade. Corviknight and Mantine both remove Stealth Rock with Defog so Landorus has an easier time switching in. Corviknight also threatens Ice-types such as Weavile and Alolan Ninetales and provides slow pivoting with U-turn, while Mantine fares well against Water-types like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert. Mega Aerodactyl not only threatens Ice-types, but its coverage also allows it to threaten opposing Landorus, Garchomp, and Tornadus-T; it can also run Stealth Rock so Landorus can run Rock Polish instead. Landorus's wallbreaking opens up sweeping opportunities for Galarian Moltres and Dragonite, which appreciate the removal of their checks such as Alolan Muk and Iron Hands.</p>"

It's also very desirable thanks to its defensive traits, which include an immunity to Electric-type attacks and Intimidate. U-turn takes advantage of the switches Landorus-T forces, allowing it to pivot out of walls that come in on it such as Corviknight and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, Knock Off cripples some of the bulky Pokemon it invites in, like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, by removing their items. Stone Edge notably hits Kyurem the hardest and is Landorus-T's best move versus Flying-types like Zapdos and Pelipper. Alternatively, Explosion lets Landorus-T score a surprise KO against an offensive threat it normally cannot OHKO, such as Keldeo or Mega Lopunny. Special wallbreakers like Galarian Moltres, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y are great partners to deal with the aforementioned physical walls Landorus-T draws in. Thundurus-T relieves pressure from Landorus-T by acting as a secondary Electric immunity and is a great asset against the Water and Flying teams Landorus-T can't do much to. Mega Aerodactyl is able to form a powerful revenge killing core alongside Landorus-T while providing Stealth Rock support for it to clean teams more easily. Corviknight switches into most Ice-type attacks aimed at Landorus-T, removes Stealth Rock with Defog, and is able to bring Landorus-T safely onto the field via its slow U-turn.</p>"

Freeze-Dry is highly effective in the Water matchup by answering would-be checks like Swampert, Gastrodon, and Slowking. Focus Blast catches Ferrothorn and Tyranitar off guard should they expect a STAB move, while Earth Power hits Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran for more damage. Mega Altaria is heavily appreciated as an answer to Dragon-types like Kommo-o, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. Garchomp provides entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to ease Kyurem's wallbreaking. Latias checks Fighting-types such as Iron Hands, Galarian Zapdos, and Terrakion, is able to replenish Kyurem's health with Healing Wish, and removes troublesome entry hazards—especially Stealth Rock, given Kyurem's Rock weakness—with Defog.

Moreover, it shrugs a hit from and beats the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R one-on-one if using a Chople Berry. Freeze-Dry lands a strong hit on Water-types like Toxapex and Gastrodon, turning Kyurem into a valuable asset in that matchup. Alongside it, Earth Power grants Kyurem near-perfect neutral coverage by nailing Steel- and Fire-types such as Magnezone and Skeledirge. The given EV spread allows Kyurem's Substitute to live one Seismic Toss from Blissey. Alolan Ninetales provides Snow and Aurora Veil support, bolstering Kyurem's defensive utility while preventing Celesteela and Heatran from breaking its Substitute. Defensive Cloyster is able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, set up Spikes to help Kyurem stallbreak more easily, and switch into physical Steel-type attacks from Mega Scizor and Melmetal. Similarly, Piloswine lays down Stealth Rock and deals with Fire- and Rock-types that Kyurem loses to, such as Volcarona and Mega Diancie.

Secret Sword enables Keldeo to break special walls such as Blissey and Hisuian Goodra that would otherwise wall it. Vacuum Wave serves as a Fighting team's main form of priority, being used to pick off weakened targets such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Meowscarada, which can be a nuisance to Fighting teams. Finally, Keldeo can use Icy Wind to immediately remove threats such as Garchomp and Latios in a pinch. Alternatively, Scald can be used as a completely accurate Water-type STAB move in situations where Hydro Pump's higher power isn't needed, while Hidden Power Electric enables Keldeo to break past Pelipper and Mantine. Iron Hands serves as an excellent partner to Keldeo, as it is able to break through Water-types that can handle Keldeo such as Tapu Fini and Toxapex along with taking on faster Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Pidgeot; in return, it appreciates Keldeo breaking Ground-types such as Gliscor and Great Tusk. Mega Gallade can break through problematic threats that can easily take on Keldeo such as Mega Venusaur and Water Absorb Clodsire, which otherwise wall Keldeo. Iron Valiant deals with Dragon-type threats such as Kommo-o, Mega Altaria, and Latias along with using coverage moves like Shadow Ball to beat Sinistcha. Breloom and Hisuian Lilligant both assist Keldeo by breaking down Water-types like Swampert and Greninja and appreciate Keldeo handling Fire-types like Torkoal and Ceruledge.

In addition to targeting Grass-types, Ice Beam also targets Dragon- and Flying-types like Dragonite and Zapdos. Extrasensory deals with Poison- and Fighting-types like Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and 2HKOes Assault Vest Iron Hands. When boosted by rain, Hydro Pump provides Greninja with an incredible nuke, allowing it to OHKO threats like Mega Gallade and Mega Scizor and 2HKO Celesteela and non-Assault Vest Alolan Muk. Alternatively, Switcheroo can also be used in the last moveslot, allowing Greninja to punish would-be switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Hisuian Goodra. Physical attackers like Mega Swampert, Choice Band Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W can eliminate special walls like Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk. With their secondary Ground typing, Swampert and Mega Swampert can handle Electric-types like Iron Hands and Raging Bolt and provide Stealth Rock support and safe entry to Greninja with Flip Turn. Mega Swampert and Barraskewda also provide valuable speed control, threatening foes like Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf users like Enamorus, with Barraskewda even outspeeding Choice Scarf variants of Meowscarada and Sneasler. Greninja appreciates Fighting-type coverage from teammates like Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Barraskewda to break through foes like Ferrothorn and Kyurem. Ogerpon-W can also remove bulky Water-types like Swampert and Gastrodon. Pelipper boosts the power of Greninja's Hydro Pump with its rain, can also provide a safe entry to Greninja with U-turn, and removes entry hazards with Defog. Toxapex offers an important neutrality to Grass and a resistance to Fighting, which allows it to take on foes like Meowscarada and Iron Valiant.

Alternatively, Dark Pulse nails Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Zoroark, and Slowbro, while Switcheroo lets Greninja weaken special walls that it cannot threaten otherwise like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Blissey. Sludge Wave is the preferred option out of the three, however, due to nailing threats that many of Greninja's teammates struggle with like Ogerpon-W and non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Ice Beam allows Greninja to handle Dragon- and Flying-types like Garchomp, Mega Latias, and the Landorus formes. Extrasensory targets Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, Okidogi, and Keldeo. Choice Scarf Meowscarada provides speed control and forms a Protean core with Greninja, with it outspeeding and taking on Swampert, Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant. Ting-Lu sets up entry hazards to aid Greninja's wallbreaking, giving Greninja a good chance to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock damage, and it also handles Steel-types such as Excadrill, Gholdengo, and Iron Crown. Furthermore, it provides an Electric immunity, which allows it to take on Electric-types like Tapu Koko, terrain-boosted Alolan Raichu, and Zeraora. Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mandibuzz, and Galarian Moltres aid Greninja in the Ground matchup due to their immunities. Hydreigon also deals with Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Scarf Kleavor with its STAB moves; Mandibuzz removes entry hazards with Defog and pivots Greninja in with U-turn; and Galarian Moltres can sweep late-game with Agility and Nasty Plot after Greninja wallbreaks. Alolan Muk's great special bulk helps Greninja deal with Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Enamorus.

These options also cover for Hisuian Goodra's passivity, as they can turn into dangerous wincons against Fighting, Fairy, and Normal teams. Kommo-o and Swords Dance Garchomp deal with Heatran, Archaludon, and Toxapex, which sit on Hisuian Goodra, and in return, Hisuian Goodra takes on Gholdengo, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Choice Scarf Nihilego with ease. Choice Scarf Latias can be considered, as it provides Healing Wish, which gives Hisuian Goodra more longevity, and also deals with Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Keldeo. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is serviceable, as it lures and removes items from bulky walls like Porygon2 and Celesteela and pivots in Hisuian Goodra to check these while still being able to outspeed and pick off threats like Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant.</p>"

Its IronPress combination also lets it act as a win condition. Protect raises Hisuian Goodra's longevity by letting it heal further with Leftovers and scout for super effective coverage from foes, but Rest can be used instead for further longevity at the cost of even more passivity; this can be mitigated with Chesto Berry, however. Shell Armor prevents foes from breaking past Hisuian Goodra's Defense boosts with a critical hit, but Sap Sipper provides an immunity to Leech Seed from foes such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Venusaur. As Hisuian Goodra can struggle with Fighting- and Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Mega Swampert, and Mega Lopunny, Mega Altaria and Latias make for good partners to check them, making a defensive core with Hisuian Goodra. This Hisuian Goodra set can struggle with Ghost-types such as Gholdengo, Ceruledge, and Mega Sableye, so partners such as Kommo-o, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon mitigate Hisuian Goodra's passivity against them. Roaring Moon in particular can also act as an offensive check to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Mega Diancie, which can otherwise overwhelm Hisuian Goodra.</p>"

Hisuian Goodra makes use of protect to scout Choice item foes such as Mamoswine and Sneasler while also providing passive recovery via Leftovers. Dragon Tail phazes setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Galarian Moltres and chips Steel-type threats like Heatran. Knock Off removes favored items from bulky switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Porygon2. Ice Beam removes Ground-type switch-ins like Landorus and Garchomp, while Flamethrower can deal heavy damage to the likes of Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Alternatively, Hisuian Goodra can run Flamethrower alongside Earthquake to decimate the Steel-type matchup and pose a threat to Heatran. Toxic can status the likes of Tornadus-T and Iron Hands, putting them on a timer and allowing Hisuian Goodra to become a great annoyance. With the use of Sap Sipper, Hisuian Goodra can be a great check foes like Celesteela and Ferrothorn attempting to use Leech Seed. Gholdengo has a Fighting immunity, is one of Steel's best checks to entry hazard removal, and mixed Fighting-types like Kommo-o without a boost. Since Hisuian Goodra has a difficult time against Fighting-types, Skarmory and Corviknight are great partners, as they both are neutral to Fighting and immune to Ground, which assists versus the likes of Excadrill and Great Tusk, and provide hazard support along with hazard removal depending on which one you choose. Mega Scizor is a fierce wallbreaker that assists in checking foes likeMega Lopunny and Iron Valiant with a +2 Swords Dance. It's also a decent check to the Ogerpon formes too with moves like Superpower. Choice Scarf Iron Treads provides great speed control and deals with Hisuian Arcanine, Zeraora, and Clodsire for Hisuian Goodra. Iron Treads also provides an Electric immunity, which helps prevent Hisuian Goodra from getting worn down over time in the Electric matchup. Ferrothorn can set hazards, spread residual damage, sponge attacks, and provide an optimal switch-in to Mega Swampert and Ogerpon-W, which it can also threaten back with Power Whip.</p>"

Diamond Storm does considerable damage to special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk and can also provide a Defense boost. Psychic heavily damages Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Nidoking, which eases the matchup against Poison teams. Earth Power deals heavy damage to Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran and Iron Treads and is paired nicely with Mystical Fire to damage Skarmory and Corviknight. On a hyper offensive team, Mega Diancie runs four attacks for coverage. With Shuckle's Sticky Web up, its good Speed tier becomes more devastating and outspeeds Pokemon like Mega Gallade and Zeraora. Mega Diancie also pairs well with Omastar and Terrakion, as Omastar takes care of the Ground matchup with a well-timed Shell Smash, while Terrakion's access to Earthquake and Close Combat takes care of most Steel-types. On bulky offense, Mega Diancie prefers to run Spikes, as the chip damage sets up a potential late-game cleanup from more offensive Pokemon on the team like Terrakion and Nihilego.

Earth Power can be used to counter Steel teams, OHKOing Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone, while dealing heavy damage to the likes of Skeledirge and Garganacl. Mystical Fire targets Steel-types that don't mind Earth Power, such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor under Psychic Terrain. Alternatively, Mega Diancie can run Nature Power and use the various terrains set by its teammates to expand its wallbreaking abilities. Stealth Rock can be used to allow Mega Diancie to set its own hazard, but four attacks are recommended given Mega Diancie's wide coverage. Klefki provides Spikes and dual screens support which allows Mega Diancie to OHKO threats like Gholdengo, and it can also carry Thunder Wave to let Mega Diancie outspeed and take out threats like Mega Gallade and Mega Aerodactyl. Tapu Koko takes on Water-types and aids in the Steel matchup by forcing out Corviknight and Celesteela. Tapu Bulu counters Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk and Urshifu-R, while Tapu Lele takes on Poison-types and prevents priority moves from Azumarill and Mega Scizor. Iron Valiant is a great partner for the Steel matchup, but it also benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain to outspeed and take out faster threats such as Zeraora and Greninja.

Greninja checks Ground-types like Clodsire, Garchomp, and Landorus and aids in the Flying matchup. Urshifu-R checks Pokemon like Kyurem and Hydreigon, which take advantage of Toxapex.

Toxic puts threats like Rotom-W, Baxcalibur, and Urshifu-R on a timer and spreads chip damage on offensive teams like Dragon, Psychic, and Fire. Knock Off is another great option to bother Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Celesteela. Haze, paired with Icium Z, shuts down setup sweepers like Z-Happy Hour Jirachi and Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, immediately regaining its health to continue walling them. Toxic Spikes are an option instead of Toxic or Knock Off; however, Toxapex has other teammates capable of setting them up and it increases Toxapex's passivity. The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from +1 SpA Jirachi's Psychic, allowing Toxapex to activate its Z-Crystal. Mega Venusaur and Crobat are excellent teammates due to their Ground-type neutrality and immunity, respectively, checking Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Mamoswine, while the former also threatens Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Due to Toxapex's Psychic-type weakness, Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking are notable teammates, checking Tapu Lele, Deoxys-S, and Latias; Galarian Slowking, in particular, forms a very strong Regenerator core with Toxapex. Clodsire and Nidoking patch up Toxapex's Electric-type weakness, and Nidoking specifically threatens Steel teams with its wide array of coverage. Galarian Weezing provides another Ground-type immunity and removes entry hazards with Defog as well as serving as a concrete answer to Baxcalibur.

Toxic punishes bulky switch-ins like Mantine, Rotom-W, Porygon2, and Volcanion. Magic Coat counters entry hazards and status spread from Pokemon like Shuckle, Celesteela, and Klefki that will attempt to exploit Araquanid's passivity. Leech Life is a niche option that gives Araquanid minor recovery and threatens Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Hydreigon, Latios, and Latias. Mirror Coat is an option for Water-resistant foes and omniboost sweepers like Pelipper, Kommo-o, and Hisuian Zoroark, as Araquanid can comfortably take an attack and OHKO them in return.

Shadow Claw notably allows Mimikyu to threaten Psychic teams even under Psychic Terrain, while Drain Punch deals more damage to Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Magnezone, and Excadrill and can mitigate Life Orb recoil. Shadow Sneak enables Mimikyu to revenge kill weakened foes and pick off faster threats like Blacephalon, Gengar, and Victini. Disguise almost always allows Mimikyu to set up a Swords Dance or revenge kill faster foes that Shadow Sneak cannot deal enough damage to.

Destiny Bond surprises fast threats like Zeraora, which Mimikyu can't OHKO or forcibly remove walls like Archaludon and Mandibuzz late-game. Trick lets Mimikyu fool walls like Hippowdon, Archaludon, and Celesteela swapping in to check its more common Swords Dance set, greatly benefiting its team mates like Ceruledge, Sinistcha, and Gholdengo that setup. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp limits threats like Choice Band Excadrill, Ogerpon-W, and Zeraora, which Mimikyu can't deal meaningful damage against. An Adamant nature is preferred as it gets important damage breakpoints, namely OHKOing Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant with Play Rough after Stealth Rock damage, but a Jolly nature outspeeds and picks off Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o. Mimikyu's damage is extremely low, being walled by most Steel- and Poison-types like Ferrothorn and Toxapex and even failing to 2HKO Slowbro.

Taunt is preferred to shut down phazers like Haze Toxapex and Hippowdon and bulky walls like Porygon2 and Clodsire, which can inconvenience Kommo-o with Toxic. Meanwhile, Clangorous Soul allows for more boosts and breaking power, notably enabling Clangorous Soulblaze to OHKO the aforementioned Hippowdon and Toxapex. Furthermore, Clangorous Soulblaze allows Kommo-o to set up on Fairy-types and Soundproof Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Trace Porygon2, and opposing Kommo-o. Soundproof prevents revenge killing attempts from Ditto or opposing Kommo-o, and a Naive nature permits Kommo-o to outpace Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora after obtaining the omni-boost. Mega Altaria is a wonderful teammate, as it helps weaken and clean up opposing Dragon teams; In return, it appreciates Kommo-o dealing with the aforementioned Steel-types. Kyurem aids in matchups against Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mantine, and Dragonite, as well as Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, and Mega Altaria. Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon provide speed control; the former offers healing and setup opportunities with Healing Wish, while the latter checks Psychic-types like Deoxys-S, Victini, and Latias. Garchomp offers entry hazards support to pressure and chip down Kommo-o's switch-ins and aids in the Steel matchup with Earthquake. Hisuian Goodra is a huge help in the Fairy matchup, taking on Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Diancie. Mega Latios threatens Flying-type threats with its BoltBeam coverage; in addition, when paired with Garchomp, it puts a lot of pressure on Poison teams, which Kommo-o tends to struggle against.

Baxcalibur is excellent in the Dark and Flying matchups, dispatching threats like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Enamorus with its Swords Dance or Dragon Dance set, and it also ravages Poison teams with Galarian Slowking, which Kommo-o might not be able to handle.

Grass Knot provides much needed coverage against troublesome Ground-types, most notably taking care of Swampert, Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch pairs wells with Tapu Koko's speed, allowing it to escape unfavorable matchups and bring in teammates like Zapdos against the likes of Mega Venusaur or Mega Scizor. Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal with Ground-types that aren't threatened by Grass Knot such as Garchomp and Landorus-T.

Both of them also appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to remove Mega Sableye and Skeledirge and luring in and critically damaging Landorus-Therian with Hidden Power Ice. Regieleki brings raw Electric-type power in the form of a boosted Rising Voltage, which is capable of sweeping teams that don't have an answer to it, and it also provides hazard removal thanks to Rapid Spin. Magnezone provides an immunity to Poison, which Tapu Koko appreciates, and more importantly traps and removes threats such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

      "Fast Pivot (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting a great Speed tier and solid coverage, Tapu Koko not only provides Electric Terrain to enable Iron Valiant, but also provides a means to deal with Flying's defensive core for Fairy teams thanks to its access to Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice. Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's most spammable attack, which it uses to eliminate roadblocks such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Toxapex, but Discharge can be used to spread paralysis against faster foes. Hidden Power Ice threatens Ground-types such as Landorus and Gliscor. U-turn is its preferred pivot option, as Tapu Koko lures in Ground-types like Ursaluna and Great Tusk that block Volt Switch, which Iron Valiant and Tapu Bulu can then handle. That said, it can also run Toxic to wear down walls like Zapdos and Hippowdon, or Taunt to shut down entry hazard and dual screens setters like Klefki, Jirachi, and Galvantula or setup sweepers like Volcarona. Roost extends Tapu Koko's longevity and thus its opportunities to pivot. Heavy-Duty Boots pairs well with Tapu Koko's role as a pivot, but Expert Belt increases its chances to OHKO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice and Toxapex with Thunderbolt. Tapu Koko's partner in crime on Fairy teams is Iron Valiant, which appreciates being pivoted into for Quark Drive to be activated and returns the favor by dealing with Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, and even some Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Mega Venusaur when using a Fightinium Z and Psychium Z, respectively. Mega Diancie provides some form of hazard control with Magic Bounce, which Tapu Koko especially appreciates if it's not running Heavy-Duty Boots, and it can handle troublesome Flying- and Fire-types such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Klefki is another great partner, as it sets up screens, allowing Tapu Koko to pivot more freely, and provides a valuable immunity to Poison. Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu serve as powerful wallbreakers that can weaken the opposing team to allow Tapu Koko to clean late-game. Tapu Lele handles foes such as Clodsire, Mega Venusaur, Nidoking, and even Mega Scizor when running Hidden Power Fire, while Tapu Bulu powers through Ground-types that don't fear Tapu Koko's Hidden Power Ice, such as Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Belly Drum Azumarill also helps in the Ground matchup,and it can utilize its priority move Aqua Jet to eliminate faster threats such as Gengar and Nihilego.</p>"

Its decent Speed tier and astounding offensive prowess combined with its great typing makes it extremely threatening because with access to STAB Moonblast, it is Psychic's best check to most Dark-type threats. Tapu Lele's presence also sets up Psychic Terrain, shielding itself and its team from dangerous priority such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Focus Blast lets it easily take care of the pesky Steel-types that resist its STAB attacks such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Iron Treads. Future Sight lets Tapu Lele set up an attack for later and then switch out to a teammate such as Victini or Mega Gallade to help it set up or get a KO. Shadow Ball lets it beat Gholdengo and clean up against Psychic and Ghost teams, while Thunderbolt gives it general coverage versus foes like Mantine and Celesteela. Tapu Lele is often not able to beat specially defensive walls such as Alolan Muk and Blissey; hence, it appreciates partnering up with Mega Gallade to eliminate them. Mega Alakazam is a good partner, as it helps in the Electric and Water matchups courtesy of Trace copying Surge Surfer and Swift Swim, respectively, and it appreciates Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain boosting its Expanding Force. Slowbro sponges hits from faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos, and can also pivot Tapu Lele in with Teleport to wreak havoc. Victini and Armarouge can eliminate Steel-types, especially Aegislash and Gholdengo, easing the burden for Tapu Lele. Jirachi can slow teams down with Thunder Wave and pivot Tapu Lele into physical walls such as Mandibuzz and Slowbro with U-turn.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge ability and complementary STAB types along with excellent coverage moves allow it to shine as a cleaner on Fairy teams. Psychic is its preferred Psychic-type STAB move, which it uses to take out Poison-types such as Toxapex, Nidoking, and Mega Venusaur, though it can also run Psyshock to hit Clodsire harder. Moonblast deals with Dark- and Dragon-types like Mega Sableye, Galarian Moltres, Kommo-o, and Latias. Focus Blast checks threats such as Heatran and Iron Treads. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes most Mega Scizor sets, while Thunderbolt threatens a wider selection of Water- and Flying-types like Celesteela, Mantine, and Mega Charizard Y. Shadow Ball could also be used to provide coverage against Aegislash and Gholdengo. Thanks to Psychic Surge, Tapu Lele shuts down priority moves from revenge killers and setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, allowing it to KO them with Hidden Power Fire, Thunderbolt, and Moonblast, respectively. Choice Scarf allows Tapu Lele to outspeed threats such as Zeraora, Choice Scarf Excadrill, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny. Tapu Lele pairs well with wallbreakers like Tapu Bulu and Azumarill that can weaken or eliminate its checks, with the former taking care of Meowscarada, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon, while the latter handles Volcarona, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Landorus. Tapu Koko helps in the Water- and Flying-type matchups by dealing with Landorus and Corviknight and offers a great Speed tier and coverage. Iron Valiant answers Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra and uses All-Out Pummeling to eliminate Dark-types like Alolan Muk, one of the best counters to Tapu Lele, and Ting-Lu, which could tank a few hits from Tapu Lele and threaten it with Poison Jab or Heavy Slam. The duo of Tapu Koko and Iron Valiant further assists Tapu Lele's late-game cleaning, as Tapu Koko activates Iron Valiant's Quark Drive, allowing it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users that are faster than Tapu Lele like Terrakion, Blacephalon, and Nihilego. Klefki's utility moves, such as Spikes, Thunder Wave, and dual screens, make it an excellent supporting partner. Thanks to Foul Play, Klefki is also able to answer bulky Swords Dance Mega Scizor, which could otherwise tank a Hidden Power Fire from Tapu Lele and KO it. Mega Diancie contributes to keeping Tapu Lele healthy by threatening hazard setters with Magic Bounce as well as Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, which can be troublesome to deal with for Tapu Lele. Mimikyu is a great partner in the Ghost matchup, being able to threaten fast foes such as Blacephalon. Ribombee's Sticky Web allows Tapu Lele to outrun faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Iron Valiant, and Gengar.</p>"

High Horsepower heavily damages Aegislash and Gholdengo and lets Tapu Bulu be a massive asset against Steel and Water teams by hitting Toxapex for heavy damage. Substitute allows Tapu Bulu to set up on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Swampert, and Mega Sableye, while Zen Headbutt is its best move against Mega Venusaur and Crobat. Klefki is a great teammate, as it sets up Spikes to ease Tapu Bulu's wallbreaking as well as Reflect and Light Screen to provide more setup opportunities. Mega Diancie threatens Flying- and Fire-types like Zapdos, Dragonite, and Volcarona for Tapu Bulu. In return, Tapu Bulu checks Gastrodon, Heatran, and Clodsire, letting Mega Diancie have more leeway on its moveset.

Grass Knot targets Ground-types attempting to take on Nihilego's Power Gem such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Mamoswine. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam deals with Dragon- and Dark-types like Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Mega Sableye. Thunderbolt threatens Water-types like Toxapex, Urshifu-R, and Keldeo. Hidden Power Ice removes the Landorus formes for Poison teams along with dealing significant damage to Garchomp and Dragonite. However, Sludge Wave threatens Fairy- and Grass-types like Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, and Ogerpon-C. Nidoking serves as an excellent special attacking complement, being able to remove Steel-types that wall Nihilego such as non-Air Balloon Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Gholdengo. Sneasler can help to break through problematic special walls such as Blissey and Hisuian Goodra thanks to its powerful Close Combat, and in return, it appreciates Nihilego beating physical walls like Toxapex and Great Tusk. Mega Venusaur helps to deal with Water- and Ground-types that Nihilego cannot handle such as Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Iron Treads. Crobat possesses a necessary Ground immunity and is able to come in on the likes of Clodsire and Excadrill along with being able to check Mega Gallade for Nihilego with its powerful Brave Bird. Alolan Muk can use Pursuit to trap and eliminate problematic Psychic- and Ghost-type threats for Nihilego like Deoxys-S, Tapu Lele, and Blacephalon while also removing Choice Scarf from foes such as Greninja, allowing for Nihilego to outspeed them. Galarian Slowking can safely pivot in Nihilego with Chilly Reception, as well as setting up Future Sight to pressure Nihilego's checks like Iron Hands and Clodsire.

Thunderbolt complements its coverage to hit foes such as Corviknight and Toxapex, and Grass Knot stops Nihilego from being walled by Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Gastrodon. The first EV spread ensures that Beast Boost triggers on Nihilego's Speed stat, easing cleaning against offensive teams, particularly Water teams because Mega Swampert is outsped by Nihilego after a boost and Sticky Web support. The second EV spread is also an option to instead handle better the matchup against more defensive teams by boosting its Special Attack instead, OHKOing Ursaluna with Grass Knot at +1 and Toxapex and Celesteela with Thunderbolt at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. Entry hazards from Shuckle and Mega Diancie better Nihilego's consistency at sweeping, with Shuckle's Sticky Web reducing Nihilego's reliance on a Speed boost from its ability, allowing it to outspeed foes such as Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Shuckle's Stealth Rock and Mega Diancie's Spikes weaken foes to put them into KO range for Nihilego, OHKOing utility Great Tusk with Grass Knot and 2HKOing Kommo-o with Sludge Wave after Stealth Rock damage. Ogerpon-C can break past bulky Ground-types Nihilego can't easily get past such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Garchomp. Nihilego's poor physical bulk leaves it vulnerable to priority from foes such as Mega Scizor and Azumarill; Hisuian Arcanine and Ogerpon-C can offensively check such foes.</p>"

Drain Punch and Thunder Punch provide Buzzwole with enough coverage to break through walls such as Celesteela, Blissey, and Archaludon. Darkest Lariat and Earthquake are notable for being able to 2HKO Gholdengo at +1, but Thunder Punch is still able to eventually break through Gholdengo with enough boosts. Substitute prevents Toxapex, Mega Sableye, and Ferrothorn from hampering it with status or Leech Seed. The EV spread provided prevents Buzzwole's Substitute from being broken by Seismic Toss, Scald, or Discharge from foes like Toxapex and Porygon2 and prevents Mega Swampert from 2HKOing Buzzwole in rain. 104 Speed EVs let Buzzwole outspeed Jolly Ursaluna and Azumarill, as well as Choice Band Victini and Urshifu-R if Sticky Web is in effect. The alternative spread provides Buzzwole with even more bulk, preventing Mantine's Scald from breaking the Substitute, but 72 Speed EVs only let Buzzwole outspeed up to Adamant Ursaluna, Gholdengo without Speed investment, and most Heatran, and up to Choice Specs Kyurem and Tapu Lele under Sticky Web. Due to this, Sticky Web setters like Araquanid and Galvantula are greatly appreciated; they also handle Volcarona and Landorus, which Buzzwole struggles with. Scizor deals with Fairy- and Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Mega Aerodactyl and in return, Buzzwole smashes Toxapex, Mantine, and Corviknight. Similarly, Mega Pinisr loves bulky walls like Archaludon, Iron Hands, and Toxapex getting worn down, as this lets Pinsir clean types like Dragon, Poison, and Fighting late-game. Volcarona is a special sweeper that works in tandem with Buzzwole to overwhelm teams and deals with Mega Venusaur and Gholdengo for Buzzwole. Choice Scarf Kleavor deals with fast threats like Mega Pidgeot and Mega Aerodactyl, which Buzzwole can't deal with and can pivot Buzzwole into walls like Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Forretress removes entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, which hamper Buzzwole's ability to wallbreak; Forretress can also pivot in Buzzwole against Defog users like Corviknight, which Buzzwole can exploit.</p>"

Leech Seed provides additional recovery for Celesteela on top of Leftovers and wears down foes that lack recovery like Barraskewda and Latias. Protect allows Celesteela to both guarantee recovery from Leftovers and scout moves from Choice-locked foes like Blacephalon and Zeraora. Toxic spreads status to foes on top of Leech Seed, wearing down walls such as Mantine in the process. Air Slash threatens Fighting- and Grass-types such as Mega Gallade, Keldeo, and Hisuian Lilligant. Flamethrower threatens the aforementioned Grass-types as well as Steel-types like Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight. 248 HP and 48 Special Defense EVs allow Celesteela to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's Thunderbolt, while the remaining EVs are invested into Defense so it can take hits from Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade. Mantine forms a defensive pairing with Celesteela, as its Water typing and its ability Water Absorb makes it great against Fire- and Water-types like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Urshifu-R. Gliscor's Ground typing and STAB Earthquake make it an important asset in the Electric matchup, and it helps Celesteela make progress against opposing teams with entry hazards, spread status with Toxic, and remove items with Knock Off. Landorus threatens Fire- and Electric-types such as Heatran, Ceruledge, and Raging Bolt. In return, it appreciates Celesteela checking Ice- and Fairy-types like Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Alolan Ninetales. Galarian Moltres and Dragonite appreciate Celesteela removing threats such as Enamorus and Ogerpon-C so they can begin sweeping.

Flamethrower targets Steel-types that resist Heavy Slam such as Corviknight, Iron Treads, and Mega Scizor, while Air Slash threatens Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Great Tusk, and Kommo-o. Alternatively, Toxic may be used to put bulkier Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Gastrodon on a timer, however, without Flamethrower, Celesteela is extremely passive in front of the aforementioned Steel-types, as well as Ferrothorn and Gholdengo which are immune to Leech Seed. Giga Drain is another option to improve the Water and Ground matchups, hitting Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Slowbro as well as improving longevity, however, it's a lot more matchup reliant than the other listed options. Protect in conjunction with Leech Seed is Celesteela's main method of forcing progress, spreading chip damage while also massively boosting its longevity. The given EV spread allows Celesteela to survive two consecutive uses of Close Combat from the likes of Mega Lopunny in addition to Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Terrakion. Heatran is by far Celesteela's most advantageous teammate due to its immunity to Fire-type moves letting it take on threats such as Volcarona and Blacephalon. In return, Celesteela walls Ground-types like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Ferrothorn is an essential teammate due to its ability to check Water-types such as Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W as well as provide utility in the form of entry hazards and additional Leech Seed support, wearing down teams greatly. Furthermore, Ferrothorn is a great answer to Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Alolan Raichu. Ghost-type teammates such as Aegislash and Gholdengo alleviate the Fighting matchup, lessening the amount of pressure put onto Celesteela as a primary switch-in and also removing threats like Skeledirge, Slowbro, and Toxapex. Choice Scarf Iron Treads and Excadrill provide an immunity against the aforementioned Electric-type Pokemon, while the former checks Landorus with Ice Spinner and the latter hinders Mega Sableye with Toxic. Furthermore, Excadrill and Iron Treads are Steel's best answers to Ogerpon-H. Mega Scizor is a great pivot into Knock Off and can take on Fighting-types due to its neutrality to them and access to Roost. Assault Vest Melmetal is a great blanket check to special attackers like Tapu Koko, Kyurem, and Gholdengo, while Hisuian Goodra is an excellent sponge for Water-type attacks, walling Volcanion, Choice Specs Pelipper, and Basculegion-F.</p>"

Mimikyu is a great wallbreaker, capable of weakening Dark, Fighting, and Dragon teams, setting Blacephalon up for success late-game. Mega Sableye prevents the setting of Stealth Rock, allowing Blacephalon to pivot freely. Gholdengo threatens Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Clefable and takes advantage of passive Blacephalon switch-ins like Toxapex and Blissey. Hisuian Zoroark's immunity to Ghost-type moves is heavily appreciated, and it lures in Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Tyranitar, and Ting-Lu with Illusion, hitting them with Focus Blast. Furthermore, Hisuian Zoroark can bluff other Blacephalon switch-ins—such as Heatran and Toxapex—to eliminate them, easing Blacephalon's job later into the match.

        "description": "<p>Cinderace acts as role compression on Fire teams, being able to apply offensive pressure on foes like Azumarill and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon with its coverage, remove entry hazards with Court Change, and revenge kill faster threats such as Iron Boulder and Ceruledge with Sucker Punch. Pyro Ball and Gunk Shot can be used over Sucker Punch, with the former handling Bug- and Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight and the latter taking on Fairy-types like Clefable and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant. High Jump Kick allows Cinderace to deal with Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types such as Blissey, Mega Tyranitar, and Ting-Lu. Iron Head is a niche option that allows Cinderace to lure in and remove Mega Diancie in the Fairy matchup. With U-turn, Cinderace can pivot out of unfavorable matchups such as Toxapex and Great Tusk and bring in a teammate that can deal with them. Heatran and Iron Moth are such teammates, with the former handling Toxapex by trapping it with Magma Storm and removing it with Earth Power and the latter taking Great Tusk out with Energy Ball. When it forgoes Sucker Punch, Cinderace appreciates Choice Scarf Blacephalon taking on Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Ceruledge, which can switch into High Jump Kick, and in return, Cinderace takes on Dark-types for Blacephalon. Torkoal sets up sun to boost Pyro Ball when it's being run and places Stealth Rock to further aid Cinderace. Notably, sun-boosted Pyro Ball 2HKOes Mega Sableye. When Cinderace runs Sucker Punch, its ability to revenge kill faster and weakened threats like Iron Boulder enables setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, Z-Celebrate Victini, and Ceruledge to start their own sweep, and the latter two specifically appreciate Court Change support so they can find an opportunity to switch in.</p>"

At +2, Pyro Ball OHKOes walls like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Clodsire after Stealth Rock damage. Breakneck Blitz allows Cinderace to catch walls such as Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and mixed Hippowdon off guard and instantly remove them. Gunk Shot targets Fairy-types like Tapu Fini, Iron Valiant, and Azumarill, while Sucker Punch may be used to prevent revenge killing attempts from Iron Boulder, Latias, and Barraskewda, OHKOing them at +2. Alternatively, High Jump Kick removes Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock Damage, Mega Tyranitar, and Heatran. Torkoal offers Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins like Rotom-W and Porygon2, sets up Drought to boost Pyro Ball's power output, and removes entry hazards via Rapid Spin to allow Cinderace to pivot freely. Victini and Mega Charizard X appreciate Cinderace luring in and eliminating the previously mentioned Sucker Punch targets while heavily weakening shared checks like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Great Tusk. Volcarona appreciates Cinderace's ability to remove special walls like Clodsire, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking. In return, Volcarona threatens walls such as Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Slowbro. Heatran provides Stealth Rock support and uses its stallbreaking ability to remove Toxapex, preserving Cinderace's Normalium Z to use in a pinch. Like Volcarona, Blacephalon appreciates Cinderace weakening special walls to let it clean up late-game; it can also break problematic foes like Slowbro and Skeledirge. Iron Moth scares away Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, and Swampert via Energy Ball and threatens Tapu Fini for Cinderace if it doesn't run Gunk Shot. Volcanion is a great switch-in against Water-types like Barraskewda, Basculegion-F, and Ogerpon-W and appreciates Cinderace's ability to remove Ground-types such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Clodsire. Mega Charizard Y and Scovillain help break down physically defensive Pokemon and remove the aforementioned Ground- and Water-type walls via Grass-type coverage, with the former also providing Drought. In exchange, Cinderace threatens Clodsire, Hisuian Goodra, and many of the aforementioned special walls so Mega Charizard Y can freely throw out attacks incautiously, while Scovillain can clean up late-game using Chlorophyll under sun.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With crucial neutralities to Rock and Ice, as well as several other resistances that let it wall several metagame threats such as Mamoswine, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Boulder, Corviknight is a solid entry hazard remover and pivot that mitigates the weakness to Stealth Rock commonly found on Flying teams. Body Press minimizes its passivity, notably hitting foes such as Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Ogerpon-C, but Iron Head can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Alolan Ninetales. Pressure ensures that Corviknight doesn't run out of Defog PP as easily because it can switch into foes setting up Stealth Rock and lower their PP, such as Piloswine, Archaludon, and Ferrothorn, but Mirror Armor can be used instead to avoid a 2HKO from Mega Diancie's Mystical Fire. The first EV spread, even if Corviknight loses Leftovers, avoids a 2HKO from Mega Gallade's Close Combat, a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat after Stealth Rock, and an OHKO from Great Tusk's +1 All-Out Pummeling. However, the alternate EV spread still avoids a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat, and it avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Protean Greninja's Ice Beam with Leftovers recovery. Mantine is a solid partner for Corviknight, as it can switch into Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Heatran, and it also forms a defensive core by more consistently handling special attackers for it. Corviknight's role compression also allows Mantine to run Toxic over Defog, or if Mantine is desired as a Defogger instead, Corviknight can run Iron Head + Body Press. Gliscor and Landorus are also good allies to switch into Electric-types that force out Corviknight such as Zapdos, Raging Bolt, Zeraora, and Alolan Raichu, in turn also forming a pivoting core with Corviknight. Offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Aerodactyl, and Tornadus-T appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting to safely be brought onto the field; in return, they act as offensive checks to foes that Corviknight can't threaten by itself such as Great Tusk, Mega Gallade, and Ogerpon-W.</p>"

Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to pivot out of Pokemon like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which are not OHKOed by rain-boosted Liquidation, while still dealing respectable damage and maintaining momentum to get in its teammates to deal with these Pokemon. Close Combat is the strongest coverage move that Barraskewda has access to and it most notably threatens Ferrothorn, which is able to take Liquidation from Barraskewda. Psychic Fangs in conjunction with an Adamant nature lets Barraskewda 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, and its secondary effect of destroying dual screens, while situational, is useful in the Fairy matchup. Crunch is an alternative option to let Barraskewda target Psychic-types like Latios, Mega Latias, and Slowbro, which are able to switch into Liquidation. Poison Jab is also an option to target Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Azumarill, which resist Liquidation and Close Combat. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, whereas an Adamant nature can also be run to achieve the aforementioned results with Psychic Fangs. Pelipper is a mandatory partner of Barraskewda, as it not only sets rain but also offers a slow U-turn as a form of pivoting, which lets Barraskewda get on the field safely, and its ability to threaten opposing Grass teams with Hurricane helps Barraskewda get past Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. Mega Swampert can form a potent Swift Swim offensive core with Barraskewda, wearing down each other's checks such as Ferrothorn and Porygon2. Swampert also works well with Barraskewda, offering hazard support in Stealth Rock to weaken opposing Pokemon so Barraskewda can secure KOs. It also provides slow pivoting with Flip Turn, and its Ground typing is a must to stave off opposing Electric-types like Regieleki, which are faster than Barraskewda outside of rain. Toxapex is also a strong defensive teammate for Barraskewda, being able to cripple Barraskewda's checks with Toxic and also handle setup sweepers like Mega Altaria and Mega Scizor with Haze. Greninja is able to break past physically defensive walls like opposing Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur, which are reliable answers to Barraskewda, while Greninja appreciates Barraskewda being able to handle specially defensive walls like Blissey and Ting-Lu.</p>"

Aqua Jet is a strong priority option to pick off faster albeit weakened sweepers and cleaners such as Ceruledge and Sneasler. Thunder Punch targets Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex, Pelipper, and Mantine, while Ice Spinner handles Dragon- and Ground-types such as Dragonite and Clodsire. However, Aqua Jet is preferred, since it stops opposing sweepers and cleaners in their tracks to enable its teammates to sweep or clean late-game. U-turn allows Urshifu-R to pivot out of unfavorable matchups, such as against Mantine and Dragonite, and bring a teammate in to deal with them. Pelipper is not only neutral to Grass, but it also sets up rain to boost Urshifu-R's Water-type STAB attacks, turning it into a potential late-game cleaner with rain-boosted Aqua Jet. It notably has a good chance of OHKOing Alolan Raichu with Aqua Jet under rain, and rain further makes Surging Strikes harder to switch into. Additionally, Pelipper removes entry hazards with Defog and pivots it in safely with U-turn. Swift Swim users such as Mega Swampert and Barraskewda thus make for great teammates as well, as they appreciate Urshifu-R's wallbreaking so they can clean late-game. Mega Swampert also provides an Electric immunity to deal with the likes of Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Zeraora. Toxapex and Empoleon are great defensive partners due to their part-Poison and part-Steel typings, respectively, that allow them to take on Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Alolan Ninetales, which Urshifu-R dislikes. Additionally, they can stack entry hazards with Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively, to aid Urshifu-R in wallbreaking, and Toxapex also removes boosts from setup sweepers with Haze. Greninja forms a strong wallbreaking duo with Urshifu-R, with it taking on the likes of Sinistcha, the Ogerpon formes, and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant for Urshifu-R, while it appreciates the removal of Ferrothorn and Empoleon in return. Ogerpon-W eases the Ground matchup thanks to its resistance, handling the Landorus formes and Garchomp in the process.</p>"

Thunderbolt offers a secondary STAB option for consistent Electric-type damage outside of Electric Terrain, while Volt Switch allows Regieleki to soften up its answers such as Porygon2 and bring in partners to either set up Electric Terrain for it or deal with the foe currently on the field. Ancient Power hits Volcarona harder than an Electric-type STAB move would while also giving Regieleki a chance to become more threatening with an omniboost. Rapid Spin allows Regieleki to have some utility outside of its sheer attacking prowess, letting it help its team if there is a Ground-type switching into it. Choice Specs allows Regieleki to annihilate nearly anything that isn't Blissey or a very specially bulky Electric-resistant foe, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets Regieleki function much better as a Rapid Spin user as well as a pivot, and Magnet allows Regieleki to not get punished as much for clicking a move. Tapu Koko is a mandatory teammate, as it deals very good damage to Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus, and Mamoswine that otherwise stuff Regieleki, and it sets up Electric Terrain to boost Regieleki's Rising Voltage to the heights of its power. Zapdos and Rotom-W both deal with Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T with Hurricane and Hydro Pump while giving Regieleki a pivot to bring it in. Furthermore, both come with unique benefits as well—Zapdos deals with Grass-types like the aforementioned Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur if Regieleki cannot immediately break through them, while Rotom-W offers entry hazard control through Defog as well as a stopgap to dangerous physical attackers like Iron Boulder thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Iron Hands provides both a way to deal with pesky special walls like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra as well as a slow pivot for Regieleki. Zeraora pairs well with Regieleki, as both are incredible attackers physically and specially, respectively, and they chip down each other's checks well. In particular, Zeraora deals with Blissey and Hisuian Goodra, major annoyances for Regieleki, while Regieleki sweeps away physically defensive Mega Venusaur.</p>"

Close Combat synergizes well with Kleavor's STAB moves, crushing Steel-types like Iron Treads. U-turn allows Kleavor to pivot out of Great Tusk and Skarmory to bring in teammates like Araquanid or Volcarona. Night Slash banishes Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Knock Off softens walls like Corviknight and Porygon2 for its teammates, and X-Scissor takes down Slowbro to make way for Mega Pinsir. Araquanid and Galvantula are excellent teammates, as these set up Sticky Web to patch up Kleavor's unassuming speed, even when using a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Additionally, they also help in dealing with pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona and Landorus, respectively. Physical setup sweepers benefit from Kleavor's ability to set hazards offensively, Knock Off items from walls, and deal with Skeledirge and Slowbro, which often wall Mega Pinsir, Scizor, and Mega Scizor. In return, they deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types like Great Tusk and Mega Diancie. Quiver Dance Volcarona appreciates Skeledirge removed, as this lets it clean up Ghost teams at +1; it can also be brought in against passive walls like Slowbro and Skarmory. Forretress provides Rapid Spin and loves Kleavor's ability to set Stealth Rock, as this allows it to run other hazards like Toxic Spikes or Volt Switch to better support the team. Lokix provides great offensive support with its access to priority in First Impression and Sucker Punch to finish off teams weakened by Kleavor through entry hazards and repeated Knock Offs.

Earthquake targets Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo, Archaludon, and Toxapex. Drain Punch provides Ursaluna with reliable recovery while dealing damage, taking advantage of high-HP walls like Ting-Lu and Blissey. A Jolly nature is more desirable, as most walls like Mandibuzz and Mega Venusaur only invest enough Speed for Adamant Azumarill, which Speed ties with Adamant Ursaluna. However, an Adamant nature allows Ursaluna to OHKO Iron Hand and potentially OHKO Archaludon with Earthquake.

U-turn pivots Sneasler out of switch-ins such as Skeledirge, Aegislash, and Gliscor, bringing in Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Mega Gallade. Switcheroo further punishes walls like Corviknight if the extra speed is unneeded. Alternatively, Rock Slide lets it revenge kill Quiver Dance Volcarona, freeing up a moveslot on Iron Hands, while Toxic Spikes greatly pressure Fairy teams wary of Dire Claw. Night Slash can also be the final move for Sneasler, as it notably hits Gholdengo and Aegislash, but pivoting out of these threats is usually the better option. Choice Scarf Sneasler is a late-game cleaner, so wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Kommo-o and Mega Gallade are appreciated, as these deal with Corviknight, Gliscor, and Toxapex.

Galarian Slowking can take on special threats such as Choice Specs Latios and Tornadus-T, along with using Future Sight to pair with Sneasler's Close Combat to deal immense damage to threats.

Earth Power pairs well with Moonblast, hitting Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types that resist Moonblast like Toxapex, Heatran, and Cinderace. On the other hand, Mystical Fire targets the likes of Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight; however, Earth Power is preferred due to the greater number of targets it hits. Superpower not only hits threats like Empoleon and Ogerpon-C, but it can also help Enamorus snowball through Normal and Rock teams thanks to Contrary boosting. Healing Wish allows Enamorus to cure status and grant longevity to a weakened teammate. Gliscor and Landorus both provide entry hazard support and Electric immunity, and Landorus also wallbreaks to enable a sweep from Enamorus. Corviknight and Mantine remove Stealth Rock for Enamorus with Defog, and they can switch into Sneasler and Mega Swampert, respectively. Mega Charizard Y and Tornadus-T both handle bulky threats like Mega Venusaur and Swampert. In return, Enamorus provides Healing Wish support. Mega Aerodactyl forms a great revenge killing core with Enamorus, handling Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Galarian Slowking for Enamorus while also appreciating Enamorus removing Choice Scarf Nihilego.</p>"

Flower Trick is Meowscarada's most powerful move, picking off weakened foes such as Tapu Lele and Terrakion. Play Rough is essential, as it deals with many threats to Dark teams like Galarian Zapdos, Mega Gallade, and Iron Valiant. U-turn allows Meowscarada to switch out of unfavorable situations, pivoting into powerful teammates such as Galarian Moltres and Mega Tyranitar while keeping momentum for the team. Knock Off cripples defensive switch-ins—such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Clefable—as well as offensive Pokemon like Zeraora and Iron Treads. Toxic Spikes can be run instead to better pressure Normal, Fairy, and Fighting teams. Meowscarada's teammates appreciate its ability to check a myriad of threats as well as its revenge killing capabilities. Wallbreakers like Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon are great partners to deal with physical walls like Celesteela and Mega Venusaur. Ting-Lu and Tyranitar provide entry hazard support for Meowscarada—ensuring it is able to net more KO's—and are great defensive pivots for it to fall back upon. Similarly, Mega Sableye provides a Fighting immunity, bounces back status moves, and prevents entry hazards from going up, letting Meowscarada switch in unscathed.</p>"

Flower Trick is Meowscarada's best STAB option and is capable of dealing with weakened Pokemon like Clodsire and Spectrier. Flower Trick's guaranteed critical hit is also very useful in the Fairy matchup and lets Meowscarada revenge kill Azumarill and a weakened Tapu Lele behind Reflect. U-turn allows Meowscarada to maintain an advantage against its defensive checks like Corviknight by being able to pivot into its teammates like Scovillain. Knock Off is a tool to cripple Meowscarada's defensive switch-ins like Toxapex and Klefki in addition to the aforementioned Corviknight. Play Rough is a strong coverage option to threaten opposing Dragon-type Pokemon like Kommo-o, Kyurem, and Latios, which Grass teams tend to struggle against. Low Kick is a less frequent option but lets Meowscarada OHKO Bisharp while threatening Heatran with a 2HKO; however, Play Rough is preferred to have an easier time against Dragon teams. Meowscarada has an easier time revenge killing foes with entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Cradily. Ferrothorn appreciates Meowscarada's ability to check Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Iron Valiant and Galarian Zapdos with STAB Play Rough. Hisuian Lilligant is also a fantastic offensive partner for Meowscarada. It is able to check the Flying-types that switch into Meowscarada like Celesteela and Landorus-T while also assisting in the Dragon matchup, outspeeding common Pokemon like Garchomp and Dragonite. Hisuian Lilligant also makes the Steel matchup easier for Grass; its ability to threaten Heatran is appreciated by Meowscarada, while Meowscarada can threaten Gholdengo with Knock Off, which Lilligant cannot beat. Mega Venusaur is also a mandatory defensive partner for Meowscarada; its Bug neutrality and bulk allows it to act as a consistent check to Mega Scizor, which easily switches into any move of Meowscarada, and Venusaur is able to check it with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur also checks opposing Fairy-types for Meowscarada like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant, while Meowscarada is able to threaten the Psychic-types that force out Mega Venusaur such as Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Victini. Whismicott is one of the best hazard removal options on Grass, and Meowscarada appreciates not having Stealth Rock and Spikes chip it down, because it comes in often to threaten a KO. Whimsicott's Fairy typing also allows Meowscarada and its teammates not to be overwhelmed by Dragon-types like Garchomp, and it can encore Calm Mind Mega Latias. Celebi with Nasty Plot and Groundium Z can break defensive Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra while also being able to threaten opposing Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Toxapex.</p>"

Bitter Blade allows Ceruledge to deal with Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor while restoring its HP, letting it reactivate Focus Sash if not already consumed. Shadow Sneak allows Ceruledge to revenge kill weakened threats like Barraskewda, Iron Boulder, and opposing Ceruledge while also letting it clean opposing Ghost teams. Focus Sash guarantees that Ceruledge activates Weak Armor if it's hit with a physical attack while setting up with Swords Dance. Weak Armor's activation allows Ceruledge to outspeed faster threats like Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada, Iron Boulder, and the Landorus formes. Mimikyu handles Dark-types like Mandibuzz, Ting-Lu, and Hydreigon, and, in return, Ceruledge can deal with Steel- and Poison-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur. Sinistcha boasts Water and Ground resistances, which allow it to check foes like Ogerpon-W, Urshifu-R, and Great Tusk. Mega Sableye provides entry hazard control, allowing Ceruledge to maintain its Focus Sash. Galarian Corsola and Brambleghast set entry hazards, which makes it easier for Ceruledge to break through bulky foes. Additionally, Brambleghast provides entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin while also providing the same resistances as Sinistcha. Hisuian Zoroark, Gengar, and Gholdengo are excellent partners that help Ceruledge against physical walls like Archaludon, Toxapex, and Great Tusk.

At +2, Ceruledge 2HKOes Great Tusk and has a good chance to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock damage with Poltergeist. Shadow Sneak allows Ceruledge to take out boosted albeit weakened Pokemon like Dragonite, Alolan Raichu, Iron Boulder, and opposing Ceruledge. With Focus Sash, Ceruledge ensures its Weak Armor is activated from most physical attacks, and it lets Ceruledge set up Swords Dance once. Cinderace and Torkoal are great partners for Ceruledge, as they provide entry hazard control with Court Change and Rapid Spin, respectively, so that its Focus Sash is kept intact. Additionally, Torkoal sets up sun to further boost Ceruledge's Bitter Blade and Stealth Rock to aid its sweeping, while Cinderace targets Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar, which can pose challenges to Ceruledge's sweeping. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Victini and Mega Charizard X remove bulky Pokemon that Ceruledge dislikes. Victini takes on Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Urshifu-R, and Dondozo, while Mega Charizard X breaks past Heatran. In return, Victini appreciates Ceruledge handling Psychic-types like Iron Boulder and Mega Latias. Hisuian Arcanine revenge kills boosted sweepers such as Roaring Moon so that Ceruledge can sweep, and it can threaten Flying-types such as Galarian Moltres and Zapdos. Ceruledge can also enable other sweepers and cleaners such as Volcarona by removing Pokemon that threaten them such as Skeledirge so they can start their own sweep.</p>"

Earthquake targets Steel- and Fire-types like Gholdengo, Archaludon, Heatran, and Victini as well as Toxapex. Alternatively, Knock Off provides Cetitan with a way to threaten Slowbro and Rotom-W. Ice Shard, after a Belly Drum boost, allows Cetitan to pick off Choice Scarf foes like Sneasler and Iron Boulder, which outspeed it even in snow. A Jolly nature can also be used to allow Cetitan to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Blacephalon, Iron Moth, and Iron Treads in snow. Alolan Ninetales is an essential teammate for its ability to set snow and provide Aurora Veil support, facilitating Cetitan's sweeping capabilities. Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales also break through bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W, which Cetitan may struggle against.

Poison Jab not only spreads status but also lets it hit Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Ogerpon-W, and Enamorus. Pairing Haze up with Icium Z allows Clodsire the ability to recover any damage from setup sweepers such as Volcarona, Ogerpon-W, and Kommo-o. The given EV spread allows Clodsire avoid a 2KHO from Choice Scarf Meowscarada with Flower Trick, unboosted Ogerpon-W with Horn Leech, and Choice Scarf Greninja with Ice Beam. Landorus provides an immunity to Ground-type moves that threaten Clodsire and offensively threatens Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Celebi, and Archaludon. Hippowdon is a phenomenal defensive teammate, as it provides Stealth Rock support along with setting sand upon switching in. Hippowdon also defensively supports Clodsire by checking the likes of Ceruledge, Great Tusk, and Iron Hands. Excadrill, in conjunction with sand, is a powerful wallbreaker for Clodsire that can outspeed many Pokemon and deal raw damage with a Choice Band, checking threats such as Tapu Lele, Greninja, and Mega Gallade. Garchomp is an effective teammate that assists by checking Dragon-type threats such as Kommo-o and Kyurem. Mamoswine is another great teammate for Clodsire, as its Ice typing and powerful STAB moves assists in checking threats like the Landorus formes and Dragonite.

Clodsire's access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock provides it with good opportunities to set entry hazards, with Stealth Rock being preferred because it damages every Pokemon. Alternatively, Curse can patch up Clodsire's poor physical stats and make it a win condition. Mega Venusaur serves as a great defensive compliment to Clodsire with its ability to handle Water- and Ground-types like Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, and Excadrill.

Furthermore, Knock Off also allows Great Tusk to hit Ghost-types, such as Air Balloon Gholdengo. Earthquake combined with Great Tusk's Electric immunity and general bulk allows Great Tusk to stop threats such as Regieleki and Mega Charizard X from running through Fighting teams. Taunt can be run as an alternative option over Rapid Spin to prevent threats such as Ting-Lu and Skarmory from setting entry hazards or Defog users like Corviknight from removing Great Tusk's Stealth Rock. Leftovers grants Great Tusk longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots provides safe entry, allowing it to use Rapid Spin without worrying about hazard damage. The given EV spreads maximize Great Tusk's physical bulk; 120 Speed EVs are preferred to let Great Tusk outspeed Modest Volcanion, but 96 Speed EVs can be used instead to further increase its bulk while still allowing Great Tusk to outspeed threats such as Latios and Iron Moth after a Rapid Spin. Sneasler serves as an excellent teammate with its incredible Speed and Poison typing, enabling it to handle Fairy- and Grass-types, such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Bulu, and Breloom. Iron Valiant can threaten opposing Great Tusk and Dark-types like Sableye and Mandibuzz with Moonblast, allowing for Great Tusk to reliably get Stealth Rock up. Iron Valiant also uses coverage moves such as Thunderbolt to deal with Slowbro and Mega Charizard Y while appreciating Great Tusk's handling of Poison-types, such as Sneasler and Galarian Slowking. Mega Gallade can check Poison- and Fighting-type threats such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo. Kommo-o appreciates Great Tusk keeping hazards off the field and, in response, can set up safely with Clangorous Soulblaze, enabling it to overcome Flying and Water teams that greatly threaten Great Tusk.

Earthquake hits Pokemon like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Toxapex, while Ice Spinner nails Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Zapdos, allowing Great Tusk to boast unresisted coverage in combination with Close Combat. Rapid Spin allows Great Tusk to gain a Speed boost to easily snowball against slower teams and remove entry hazards for teammates; however, Knock Off is great for Air Balloon Gholdengo and weakened Slowbro as well as generally forcing progress against teams by removing their items. Gastrodon and Clodsire are essential teammates for Great Tusk due to their immunities to Water-type attacks, letting them fend off Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Keldeo. Gastrodon also has an appreciated neutrality to Ice-type attacks, letting it check Choice Scarf Weavile, and Clodsire is neutral to Grass-type attacks, letting it wall Meowscarada.

Furthermore, Gastrodon and Clodsire provide chip damage via Toxic and entry hazards, wearing down walls like Slowbro, Swampert, and Mantine that give Great Tusk a hard time. Landorus forms a potent wallbreaking core with Great Tusk, breaking Slowbro, Dondozo, and Mandibuzz as well as offering Gravity, letting Great Tusk more easily spam Earthquake.

Knock Off weakens walls such as Rotom-W, Staraptor, and Celesteela that wall Iron Treads. Alternatively, Stone Edge is an option to remove Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Mega Pinsir. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards and gives Iron Treads enough Speed to clean up weakened Electric, Ground, and Dragon teams. Air Balloon lets Iron Treads safely switch into Excadrill and Mamoswine and creates uncomfortable situations for Ground and Bug teams due to its initial immunity to Ground-type moves and Sticky Web. Soft Sand allows Earthquake to 2HKO Mega Sableye after Stealth Rock damage, preventing Mega Sableye from switching in to spinblock Iron Treads. As Iron Treads is relatively weak, stallbreakers like Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Swords Dance Mega Scizor are excellent for weakening or removing walls; Gholdengo beats Archaludon and Mega Sableye and Mega Scizor deals with Ferrothorn and Slowbro. Mega Scizor also provides great neutralities that allow it to switch into Fighting- and Ground-types like Mega Lopunny and Clodsire with ease, while Gholdengo handles Body Press users like Skarmory and Fighting-types like Sneasler. Choice Scarf teammates such as Gholdengo, Heatran, and Archaludon supplement Iron Treads's speed control, as they outspeed and pick off Mega Gallade, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny, which threaten to OHKO Iron Treads. Heatran also provides a Fire immunity and hazards or Toxic to further chip down opposing teams. Physically defensive Archaludon and Ferrothorn are great for dealing with Ogerpon-W, which can use Iron Treads as setup fodder, and support Iron Treads through debilitating foes with Thunder Wave and setting hazards. Celesteela and Skarmory are Ground-immune teammates that can switch into Mega Diancie or Choice Band Excadrill to avoid Iron Treads's Air Balloon from breaking prematurely; Celesteela is also a decent mixed wall that smothers Dragon and Fairy teams, while Skarmory has access to hazards and Whirlwind to further weaken opposing teams for Iron Treads.</p>"

Alternatively, Knock Off pressures defensive switch-ins such as Rotom-W, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn while also being Iron Treads's best move against Air Balloon Gholdengo and Latias. Iron Treads can provide emergency entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin for faster-paced Steel teams. Hard Press is a niche option to remove frail targets like Meowscarada; however, Iron Head allows Iron Treads to revenge kill weakened Pokemon. Gholdengo is an excellent teammate that greatly capitalizes on Z-Moves, offers a Fighting-type immunity, and acts as a situational Ground-type immunity with Air Balloon. It also removes walls like Slowbro, Corviknight, and defensive Great Tusk. In return, Iron Treads offers a valuable answer to Fire-types such as Cinderace, Volcanion, and Victini. Heatran absorbs Fire-type attacks from faster threats like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Iron Moth, in addition to setting up Stealth Rock to wear down switch-ins for Iron Treads. Celesteela and Corviknight offer a Ground-type immunity, walling Sand Rush Excadrill and Hippowdon. Furthermore, Corviknight provides slow pivoting via U-turn, while Celesteela pressures foes with residual chip damage using Toxic and Leech Seed. In exchange, Iron Treads threatens Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Sandy Shocks, as well as Fire teams, removing Hisuian Arcanine and Ceruledge once its Focus Sash has been broken. Ferrothorn is a great buffer against Water- and Ground- types like Gastrodon, Swampert, Mamoswine, and Slowking. Additionally, Ferrothorn boasts an array of utility options such as Leech Seed, Knock Off, and Spikes, wearing down Iron Treads's switch-ins and allowing for a free Stone Edge moveslot.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Hands is a great addition to an Electric team, as its bulk combined with an Assault Vest allows it to take hits from Pokémon that Electric teams otherwise struggle against like Kyurem and Landorus-T while also pivoting into frail teammates. Drain Punch is Iron Hands’s only form of recovery and is capable of dealing blows to Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Ferrothorn. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to threaten Ground-types like Landorus and Garchomp, as it can take an attack from Landorus and an unboosted Garchomp. Rock Slide allows Iron Hands to OHKO Blacephalon, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y, while Thunder Punch still deals with Mega Charizard Y while also dealing with Water-types and bulkier Flying-types such as Manaphy, Slowbro, and Corviknight. Volt Switch allows it to pivot out of checks like Tapu Lele and Mega Sableye and into Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Regieleki that can deal damage to the opposing team, while Earthquake allows it to deal with Gholdengo and opposing Iron Hands, as they would wall it otherwise. The EV spread allows Iron Hands to avoid an OHKO from +2 Dragonite's Earthquake or a 2HKO from Mega Charizard Y, allowing Iron Hands to retaliate with an Ice Punch or Rock Slide. The EV spread also allows it to OHKO Garchomp with Ice Punch while in Electric Terrain due to Quark Drive set by its teammates. Tapu Koko is an amazing partner with Iron Hands, as it can take care of Mega Sableye and Mamoswine while also setting Electric Terrain, which allows Iron Hands to hit harder through Pokemon like Toxapex. Iron Hands is weak to Ground-type Pokemon like Mamoswine and Landorus-T, so Pokemon with a Ground immunity like Zapdos and Rotom-W can ease some pressure on Iron Hands while also taking some hits defensively. Both can also form a pivoting core with Iron Hands to pivot frail teammates in on both physical and special attackers, increasing the amount of times these teammates can come in, and both also have the opportunity to use Defog, allowing Iron Hands to avoid taking entry hazard damage. Rotom-W in particular can cripple physical attackers that Iron Hands can’t handle, like Mamoswine and Garchomp, with Will-O-Wisp. Regieleki is also a great teammate, as it can capitalize on Iron Hands's removal of special walls for it to sweep.</p>"

Thunder Punch breaks through problematic Flying- and Water-types like Tornadus-T, Mega Pidgeot, and Manaphy. Ice Punch deals with Ground- and Grass-types switching in to take on Iron Hands's Thunder Punch such as Gliscor and Celebi. Drain Punch provides Iron Hands with a form of recovery while still enabling it to check threats such as Hydreigon. Finally, Volt Switch allows Iron Hands to be a slow pivot for Fighting teams that can safely bring in frail offensive threats like Sneasler. Alternatively, Heavy Slam can be used to let Iron Hands crush Fairy-types like Mega Diancie. The chosen EV spread allows for Iron Hands to OHKO uninvested Tornadus-T while maintaining bulk. For teammates, Iron Valiant is a special attacking threat that can break past physical walls like Slowbro and Mega Sableye that hamper Iron Hands. Iron Hands appreciates Mega Gallade being able to handle Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Okidogi, which wall it. Great Tusk provides Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support to help with Iron Hands's longevity and make it more threatening, the latter potentially allowing it to 2HKO physically bulky Toxapex. Sneasler can handle Fairy-types that Iron Hands cannot such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele while appreciating Iron Hands's slow Volt Switch to safely get it on the field. Since Keldeo is able to deal with Ground-types such as Great Tusk and the Landorus formes, which threaten Iron Hands immensely, it serves as an excellent teammate. Similarly, Hisuian Lilligant, after a boost, can break past Ground-types such as Swampert and Sand Rush Excadrill along with Water-types that can overwhelm Iron Hands like Rotom-W. Kommo-o helps Iron Hands with breaking through walls such as Scizor and Gholdengo that can prove problematic for it.</p>"

Dazzling Gleam covers threats such as Hydreigon and Kommo-o. Torkoal sets up sun to boost Iron Moth's Fiery Dance to make it a more terrifying snowballing option and Stealth Rock to aid Iron Moth's cleaning, notably breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy from their users. Both Torkoal and Cinderace also serve as entry hazard control with Rapid Spin and Court Change, respectively, and the latter can bring Iron Moth in with U-turn to keep momentum. Mega Charizard X and Hisuian Arcanine pair well with Iron Moth, as they take on Heatran and Blissey, which otherwise wall Iron Moth. Heatran itself serves as a great partner, as due to its access to Magma Storm and Taunt, it can shut down and eliminate walls such as Toxapex. In return, Heatran appreciates Iron Moth taking on Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Mega Swampert, and Gastrodon. Thanks to Iron Moth's ability to take on bulky foes such as Mega Sableye and Tapu Fini as well as speedy Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Choice Scarf Enamorus, it can enable late-game sweepers such as Ceruledge and Volcarona to begin their own sweep.</p>"

Make It Rain lets Gholdengo hit foes such as Alolan Muk, Mandibuzz, and Kommo-o, as well as OHKO Ice- and Fairy-type foes such as Mamoswine, Alolan Ninetales, and Iron Valiant, and at +2, this move OHKOes Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Ursaluna. The given EV spread allows Gholdengo to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine and avoid a 2HKO from Mega Scizor's Knock Off, Ogerpon-C's Knock Off after Stealth Rock, and Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Thunderbolt. Mega Sableye forms a good defensive core with Gholdengo, as Mega Sableye mitigates its vulnerability to Dark- and Ghost-type foes such as Meowscarada, Greninja, and Hisuian Zoroark, while Gholdengo handles Fairy-types including Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Sinistcha can switch into Ground-types such as Garchomp, Mega Swampert, and Great Tusk that Gholdengo is vulnerable to.

Heavy Slam alongside 32 Attack EVs allows Ting-Lu to OHKO Choice Scarf Tapu Lele as well as dissuade other Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu from switching in for free. Ruination allows Ting-Lu to deal consistent damage to opposing walls such as Corviknight and Porygon2 and force them to use up their recovery moves' PP, softening them up in the long run for a teammate like Meowscarada or Hydreigon. Rock Slide allows Ting-Lu to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Quiver Dance Volcarona, which can be an issue if not running Whirlwind. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to stop setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Volcarona as well as Swords Dance Garchomp, Nasty Plot + Substitute Hydreigon, and Z-Celebrate Victini from using it as setup fodder, while both Spikes and Stealth Rock allow Ting-Lu to chip down defensive pieces like the previously talked-about Porygon2 as well as Ferrothorn, Hisuian Goodra, and Clodsire every time they attempt to answer a threat. Offensive teammates such as Meowscarada, Hydreigon, and Weavile appreciate Ting-Lu setting hazards to chip down their answers into range of their attacks. Alolan Muk provides a Fairy neutrality to answer threats like Tapu Lele and Enamorus alongside Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Staraptor. Mega Sableye offers hazard control to let Ting-Lu maximize its longevity and come in safely to check threats, combats Mega Gallade and Sneasler thanks to its Fighting immunity, blocks Rapid Spin from the likes of Iron Treads and Terapagos, and provides Knock Off support to help whittle down the aforementioned Heavy-Duty Boots users.

Iron Head targets Mega Diancie and Alolan Ninetales; though it doesn't OHKO Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Mega Altaria, Iron Head deals enough damage to pick these Pokemon off late-game. U-turn lets Roaring Moon keep up the momentum against walls that usually switch into it, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Archaludon. Knock Off, aside from dealing with Ghost-types like Blacephalon and Gengar, also strips switch-ins like Staraptor, Rotom-W, and Corviknight of their items, making it easier for Dragon teams to overwhelm these defensive Pokemon late-game. Roaring Moon is unfortunately still outsped by even faster Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Meowscarada, or Swift Swim and Sand Rush Pokemon like Barraskewda and Excadrill, so switch-ins to these threats like Hisuian Goodra, Archaludon, or Mega Latias are appreciated. Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra also help a lot against a plethora of threats, with Archaludon providing Stealth Rock while weathering physical assaults from Mega Altaria, Weavile, and opposing Roaring Moon. Whereas Hisuian Goodra takes minimal damage from Tapu Lele and SubRoost Kyurem while also having the ability to phaze out threats Roaring Moon struggles to handle like Autotomize Celesteela or Volcarona. Kyurem and Z-move Kommo-o wear down the defensive cores of Water, Flying, Poison, Steel, and Normal teams which can provide an opening for Roaring Moon to clean up these teams late-game. Mega Altaria and Mega Latias love Roaring Moon removing Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant, as this opens up an opportunity for them to overwhelm Fairy and Fighting teams late-game. Garchomp wears down Steel- and Poison-types like Skarmory and Toxapex that Roaring Moon has trouble with, sets Spikes, and can phaze out threats like Volcarona and Unburden Sneasler that take advantage of Roaring Moon.</p>"

Alternatively, Knock Off removes items from checks like Corviknight and Rotom-W before Roaring Moon sets up and sweeps later. Knock Off is also preferred on Heavy-Duty Boots sets, as it offers more utility and upfront damage. Earthquake complements its Roaring Moon's Dark-type STAB attack by dealing with Fairy- and Dark-types like Tapu Koko and Alolan Muk. Substitute gives Roaring Moon safety while setting up, turning Slowbro and Toxapex into setup fodder, while Iron Head enables it to clean up Fairy teams at +1 if it finds time to set up; Iron Head also OHKOes Mega Diancie at +0. Mega Altaria with Dragon Dance or Agility complements Roaring Moon, dealing with Fighting- and Dragon-types like Iron Valiant, Kommo-o, and opposing Mega Altaria that Roaring Moon struggles with. Mega Altaria can also use Will-O-Wisp to prevent Celesteela, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu from breaking Roaring Moon's Substitute in one hit. Choice Scarf Latias handles Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny, and it provides Healing Wish to provide Roaring Moon with a second chance to sweep. Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra provide crucial neutralities to Ice and Fairy, and they deal with Weavile and Meowscarada and Tapu Lele and Kyurem, respectively.

Its STAB Moonblast is one of its best qualities, being able to easily beat Mega Sableye and OHKO most opposing Fighting- and Dragon-types such as Buzzwole and Mega Altaria. Thunderbolt is great coverage to hit Flying- and Water-types like Tornadus-T and Toxapex that otherwise wall Iron Valiant, while Energy Ball lets it deal with Mega Swampert, which it can outspeed even under rain, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon more easily. Shadow Ball prevents Iron Valiant from being walled by Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Aegislash while also improving the Psychic matchup. Knock Off and Trick cripple defensive switch-ins such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Clodsire by removing or replacing important items and forcing them to go without passive recovery or be Choice locked. Iron Valiant is also a great asset in the Fairy and Electric matchups, as it uses opposing Tapu Koko's Electric Surge to activate its own Quark Drive and outspeed even Regieleki and Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain.

Iron Hands and Great Tusk are great teammates for the Electric matchup while also beating the likes of Toxapex, Galarian Moltres, and Gholdengo. Cobalion and Great Tusk can set up Stealth Rock and even clear entry hazards in the case of the latter. Cobalion also helps against Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele, while Great Tusk helps deal with Tapu Koko and Assault Vest Iron Hands. Choice Band Urshifu-R is a great ally to beat Fire-types such as Volcarona and Skeledirge and Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill. Kommo-o deals with bulky Water-, Fire-, and Grass-types like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Mega Venusaur with its massive Clangorus Soulblaze in conjunction with Taunt. Breloom is also a natural counter to Water-types, being able to deal with Swampert, and hindering defensive walls such as Toxapex with Spore.

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-W is a strong wallbreaker on Water teams by virtue of its great Attack, which can be further boosted by Swords Dance; great Speed; a unique resistance to Ground, improving that matchup; and a selection of coverage options it can choose from. Horn Leech not only lets Ogerpon-W recover HP, but it also targets the likes of Urshifu-R, Slowbro, and Mantine, which can otherwise shrug off an Ivy Cudgel. At +2, Play Rough targets Dragon- and Fighting-types such as Kyurem, Kommo-o, and Iron Hands. After a Swords Dance boost, Superpower is great against Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra, Archaludon, and Ferrothorn; unboosted, it also OHKOes Kyurem after Stealth Rock chip. Taunt shuts down passive walls such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Thunder Wave Archaludon to force them out and get the opportunity to set up, while after a boost, Knock Off targets Sinistcha. Swampert provides entry hazard support to help Ogerpon-W wallbreak and pivoting with Flip Turn; its Electric immunity improves the matchup against the type, handling the likes of Zeraora, Iron Hands, and Regieleki. Empoleon and Pelipper remove hazards in Defog so that Ogerpon-W does not get worn down. Additionally, Empoleon threatens Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Alolan Ninetales, as well as Tornadus-T and Kyurem, while Pelipper sets up rain to boost Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel, handles Grass-types like Meowscarada and Mega Venusaur, and brings it in safely with U-turn. In return, Empoleon appreciates Ogerpon-W handling Ground-types such as Great Tusk and the Landorus formes, while Pelipper appreciates the removal of Hisuian Arcanine, the Landorus formes, and Gholdengo. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, with its amazing bulk, handles fast Fighting- and Dragon-types like Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and can shift its Choice Scarf to walls like Toxapex and Clodsire with Trick so Ogerpon-W can handle them more easily. Choice Specs Greninja, with its colorful coverage boosted by Protean, handles a multitude of threats like opposing Ogerpon-W, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur. When paired with Pelipper, Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking opens up the door for rain-boosted sweepers and cleaners such as Mega Swampert and Barraskewda.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-C is a formidable choice on Grass teams that holds its own over its Rock typing, coupled with it's amazing Attack and Speed, makes it a formidable threat to the Bug-, Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types that threaten Grass teams such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, Alolan Ninetales, and Tornadus-T with the powerful and accurate Ivy Cudgel. Swords Dance can boost Ogerpon-C's Attack to a threatening level, boosting Ivy Cudgel even more to break through formidable walls such as Corviknight and Celesteela. Horn Leech grants recovery for Ogerpon-C while also regaining Sturdy once it gets back to full. At +2, Superpower breaks through Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Archaludon, Heatran, and Hydreigon. Choice Scarf Meowscarada can handle any threatening Dragon-types for Ogerpon-C such as Roaring Moon, MegaAltaria, and Kommo-o with its Protean-boosted Play Rough while also removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite and Leftovers from Corviknight with Knock Off. Mega Venusaur is a defensive teammate for Ogerpon-C that can take threatening Fire- and Ice-type moves with its ability, Thick Fat, such as Meowscarada's Triple Axel. Ferrothorn is another defensive teammate that can provide entry hazard support and take on physical threats such as Melmetal and Weavile. Sinistcha is a great late-game setup sweeper that can become a wincon alongside Ogerpon-C with access to Calm Mind and Strength Sap. Breloom provides a form of priority with Technician-boosted Mach Punch and can put foes to sleep with Spore.</p>"

Horn Leech is a STAB move that grants Ogerpon-C longevity, mitigating chip damage to more reliably trigger Sturdy, and it threatens common checks to Rock teams such as Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Rotom-W. Knock Off 2HKOes foes such as Sinistcha and Gholdengo while also removing Heavy-Duty Boots to make foes vulnerable to entry hazards. Superpower is an alternative option to hit Steel-types that could otherwise wall Ogerpon-C, and after a Swords Dance, it OHKOes Ferrothorn and, after Stealth Rock, Archaludon as well. Shuckle and Mega Diancie can set entry hazards to let Ogerpon-C more easily apply offensive pressure; the former's Sticky Web allows Ogerpon-C to outspeed foes such as Mega Gallade, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny. As Ogerpon-C struggles with taking care of Fighting-types such as Kommo-o, Mega Lopunny, and Sneasler, partners like Mega Diancie and Iron Boulder, which can simultaneously take advantage of Shuckle's Sticky Web and offensively check these threats, pair well. Ogerpon-C can struggle with Steel-types as well, so allies that can more easily overwhelm them such as Hisuian Arcanine and Z-Crystal Iron Boulder are also appreciated.</p>"

Flash Cannon targets problematic Fairy-types like Mimikyu and Mega Altaria, in addition to OHKOing Iron Valiant and Mega Diancie. Body Press synergizes with Stamina, providing Archaludon with a way to threaten Steel-, Dark-, and Ice-types like Hisuian Goodra, Roaring Moon, and Cetitan. Stealth Rock wears down foes, aiding against offensive threats like Enamorus and Ceruledge. Thunder Wave punishes switch-ins by slowing them down, making it easier for teammates to revenge kill them. Foul Play allows Archaludon to eliminate Ceruledge as well as punish other physical attackers like Ogerpon-W and Mega Scizor. Lastly, Protect allows Archaludon to capitalize on Leftovers recovery and potentially scout against Choice-locked foes like Tapu Lele and Greninja. The EV spread allows Archaludon to outspeed defensive Great Tusk and survive Mega Diancie's Earth Power. Due to its low Special Defense, Archaludon is threatened by special attackers like Tapu Lele, Kyurem, Hydreigon, and Greninja, making Hisuian Goodra a valuable teammate that can handle these foes. Mega Altaria, Latias, and Latios are excellent partners for their ability to deal with Fighting-types like Mega Gallade, Kommo-o, and Keldeo. Latias and Latios also provide a Ground immunity and, along with Kyurem, can deal with Ground-types like Clodsire and Hippowdon; Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Raging Bolt are exceptional wallbreakers that help take out foes like Volcarona, Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela. All of these Pokemon also help Archaludon deal with Toxapex.</p>"

With Devastating Drake, Raging Bolt breaks through bulkier targets like Mega Venusaur and Archaludon, and it also applies tremendous pressure on bulky Ground-types, having a high chance to KO Gliscor without a boost, OHKOing specially defensive Swampert at +1, and providing good odds to OHKO Water Absorb Clodsire at +1. With its typing, Raging Bolt switches in against foes like Mega Charizard Y and Ogerpon-W and threatens them out with its STAB moves. Thunderclap lets Raging Bolt revenge kill faster threats like Greninja and Enamorus as well as Iron Valiant at +1. 136 Speed EVs allow Raging Bolt to outspeed Jolly Ursaluna and specially defensive Heatran. Rotom-W and Zapdos provide crucial Ground-immune teammates for the team. Rotom-W can take on threats like Sand Rush Excadrill, Mega Swampert, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Zapdos can remove foes like Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu and serve an offensive or defensive role, assisting against Ground and Fighting teams. Tapu Koko threatens Dragon- and Dark-types like Latios, Hydreigon, and Weavile, and with Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice, it helps in alleviating Ground matchups, removing threats like Landorus. Tapu Koko also sets Electric Terrain to boost Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, most notably allowing it to OHKO bulkier threats like Mega Diancie and Galarian Darmanitan with +1 Thunderclap. Iron Hands and Choice Band Zeraora eliminate special walls like Hisuian Goodra and Blissey as well as Ferrothorn while also covering Ice- and Dark-types like Kyurem and Mega Tyranitar. Regieleki and Alolan Raichu offer valuable speed control. Regieleki possesses incredible natural Speed, outspeeding Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and +1 Volcarona, while Alolan Raichu can outspeed +1 Roaring Moon, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and even Sand Rush Excadrill when under Electric Terrain.

Iron Boulder can use Shattered Psyche to tear through Fighting- and Poison-types such as Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Mighty Cleave and Close Combat complement each other, allowing Iron Boulder to deal with Volcarona, Hisuian Goodra, and Galarian Moltres. After a boost, All-Out Pummeling can even break the likes of Archaludon and Ting-Lu. Shuckle can easily set entry hazards to make it easier on Iron Boulder to set up and threaten defensive checks like Heatran. With its secondary Grass typing, Ogerpon-C can break through Water- and Ground-types like Hippowdon and Mega Swampert more easily while also being a secondary setup sweeper that pairs well with Iron Boulder. Mega Diancie, in conjunction with Iron Boulder, can break through Fighting and Dark teams with its Fairy typing and powerful Moonblast, being the best way to remove the likes of Mega Sableye. Thanks to its Fire typing, Hisuian Arcanine can assist in breaking through Steel- and Grass-types such as Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu with Flare Blitz. Mega Aerodacty can assist in the matchup versus the likes of Excadrill once Sticky Web is set , assisting in removing the few foes that outspeed Iron Boulder.</p>"

Close Combat smashes Steel-types aiming to take on Mighty Cleave such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra and is Iron Boulder's main way to revenge kill the aforementioned Dark-types. Earthquake threatens Alolan Muk, which can swap in against Iron Boulder due to its immunity to Zen Headbutt, and OHKOes Electric-types like Alolan Raichu and Regieleki. Megahorn deals with Ogerpon-W, which greatly threatens Psychic's most common physical wall in Slowbro, while Zen Headbutt lets it clean Fighting teams late-game. Alternatively, Iron Boulder can choose to run Throat Chop to deal with Ghost-types more effectively or Iron Head to finish off Mega Altaria and OHKO Alolan Ninetales and Mega Diancie. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Gallade, Nasty Plot Deoxys-S, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Choice Band Victini support Iron Boulder by either greatly weakening or outright removing defensive walls like Celesteela, Archaludon, and Porygon2, which helps it clean Flying, Dragon, and Normal teams late-game. Entry hazards from Jirachi and Deoxys-S are helpful to offset Iron Boulder's mediocre damage. Jirachi can pivot Iron Boulder in with U-turn. Celebi swaps into Ground- and Water-types like Mega Swampert and Ogerpon-W and can utilize a Nasty Plot set to break through Water and Ground teams. Mega Latias swaps into predicted Ground- and Grass-type moves and appreciates Iron Boulder weakening or removing Alolan Muk to attempt to set up a sweep with Calm Mind.</p>"
