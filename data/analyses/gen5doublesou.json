        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Hitmontop offers Intimidate combined with the rare access to Fake Out and Wide Guard. On top of this, Hitmontop has other support moves at its disposal, including Feint and Helping Hand. These moves, alongside better offensive pressure, separate Hitmontop from Scrafty. Hitmontop, however, is balanced by a mediocre Attack stat, susceptibility to Intimidate, reliance on Close Combat for damage, and low offensive pressure in the face of the metagame's most common Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Close Combat is Hitmontop's strongest STAB attack, allowing it to OHKO Excadrill and non-Chople Berry Tyranitar. Hitmontop mitigates its inability to damage bulky foes such as Jellicent and Cresselia with Toxic, which puts them on a timer and eventually forces them off the field. Helping Hand also mitigates Hitmontop's lack of offensive pressure by boosting the power of Hitmontop's teammate. Feint allows Hitmontop's teammate to pick up a crucial KO by preventing a foe from blocking incoming attacks with Protect. Wide Guard blocks powerful spread attacks such as Excadrill and Landorus-T's Earthquake, Kingdra's Muddy Water, and Heatran's Heat Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fighting Gem is the item of choice, allowing Hitmontop to secure the OHKO on Chople Berry Tyranitar, Heatran, and Kyurem-B. Fighting Gem also gives Hitmontop respectable damage output even against Fighting-resistant foes. Sitrus Berry is an option to increase its longevity, but it is typically not recommended due to Hitmontop's already low offensive presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>This EV spread outspeeds standard Heatran while maximizing Attack, with the remaining EVs dumped into HP to boost Hitmontop's overall bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hitmontop prefers to switch in and out frequently to reset Fake Out and Wide Guard while cycling Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>As many teams can benefit from Intimidate and Fake Out, Hitmontop can easily fit on teams with minimal direct support. That said, Hitmontop shines best on teams with set up Pokemon, such as Volcarona and Suicune, as the free turn generated through Fake Out allows them to setup easier. Heatran is another excellent teammate, as it benefits greatly from Fake Out. Additionally, Hitmontop can threaten opposing Heatran and Tyranitar and block Earthquake and Muddy Water with Wide Guard. Latios and Thundurus are two Pokemon that benefit from Intimidate, effectively increasing their physical bulk, and Hitmontop's good matchup into Tyranitar and Steel-types.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss is one of the best support Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. It has one of the largest array of support moves in its arsenal, including the unique combination of Follow Me and Tailwind. Togekiss's bulk is awesome, and it happens to be one of the most specially bulky users of Follow Me and Rage Powder. It's no slouch in the offensive department either, with a whopping base 120 Special Attack. Its typing is queer, having the ability to evade the common Earthquake. However, this renders it vulnerable to other common moves such as Blizzard and Rock Slide. Nonetheless, Togekiss is an extremely versatile Pokemon and should definitely be considered for a slot on your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roost is a great option to heal yourself when necessary. Body Slam is also a great option for spreading paralysis as it bypasses Taunt. Togekiss can also run an interesting support set with dual screens, but is outclassed by Pokemon such as Cresselia in this regard. Tri Attack is usable for spreading debilitating status effects onto your opponent. Hyper Voice is Togekiss's strongest spread move and benefits from STAB, but its poor coverage is disappointing. ExtremeSpeed can catch opponents off guard, but has a poor damage output and thus is a waste of a moveslot. After You is an interesting option for speeding up your team, but has major limitations that prevent it from being effective. Togekiss can also function as a weather inducer with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but the above sets are better. Togekiss also has other interesting moves such as Magic Coat, Encore, and Safeguard, but these function on a case-by-case basis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Togekiss is weak to Blizzard and Discharge, and due to these moves being common in Doubles, Togekiss might have trouble finding turns to set up. Blizzard users include Abomasnow, Kyurem, and Rotom-F, while Discharge users include Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus. Taunt users that outspeed Togekiss, including Prankster users, can prevent Togekiss from using its support moves and render it helpless, barring the moderately powerful Air Slash. Rock Slide is also a threat to Togekiss, and thus it has to beware of users such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Togekiss, like any other Tailwind user, is quite vulnerable to Trick Room, and thus steps should be taken to prevent it from being set on the field.</p> <p>Common Electric Pokemon such as Zapdos are thorns in Togekiss's side, but might not necessarily OHKO it, allowing Togekiss to unleash a Tailwind or Thunder Wave before death. Rain-boosted Swift Swim users such as Kabutops can also outspeed Togekiss and deal heavy damage, and Sand Rush-boosted Excadrill can do the same. Steel-types are checks to Togekiss as they can handle Air Slash with ease, but are usually unable to stop Togekiss from playing its support role.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set invests in bulk in order to maximize sustainability for Togekiss, permitting it to set up multiple Tailwinds throughout the match. Tailwind is an obvious option to double the Speed of all your teammates for three turns, granting a tactical advantage that has been the staple of many Doubles cores. Air Slash is an option to deal with slower and bulkier threats, such as Cresselia, while your sweepers wreak havoc on the other opponent. It also boasts a 60% chance to flinch opponents, rendering them motionless for that turn. Follow Me is a great option to grant setup opportunities for your teammate, as it lures all the opponents' attacks onto Togekiss's giant bulk and keeps your teammate safe. Protect is a classic option in Doubles to defend Togekiss from attacks, possibly leaving your teammate free to attack the opponent or to shield it from multi-hit moves. Helping Hand is a wonderful option to grant a 50% power boost to your teammate, allowing it to deliver powerful blows to the opponents.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outspeed Cresselia, minimum Speed Rotom-W, and some faster Hitmontop variants. 248 HP EVs are used so Togekiss can attain an odd HP number to receive less damage from hail and sandstorm. The rest of the EVs are put into its already stellar Special Defense as an extra boost. 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed maximum Speed neutral base 70s, specifically Hitmontop and Ludicolo. 16 Defense EVs can be given to allow Togekiss to survive a Choice Band- or Helping Hand-boosted Rock Slide from Tyranitar. A Sitrus Berry is given instead of Leftovers as it is more useful in sand and hail, being able to restore 25% of Togekiss's health instead of being nullified by weather. Additionally, it is more helpful in allowing Togekiss to tank two attacks in a turn.</p> <p>Togekiss usually aids teammates instead of having teammates aid it; it works well with powerful teammates with middling Speed such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, Breloom, Metagross, and more. Mold Breaker Excadrill is a great partner for Togekiss, with Follow Me to allow a Swords Dance boost; it can also use Earthquake freely, as Togekiss is immune to Ground-type attacks. Hitmontop is also a good partner thanks to Intimidate, helping to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense while providing Wide Guard support to protect Togekiss from Blizzards, Rock Slides and Discharges. Heracross and Mamoswine are also decent partners, having good synergy with Togekiss and appreciating Tailwind support. Heracross can defeat the Rock- and Ice-types that threaten Togekiss, while Mamoswine handles Electric- and Ice-types. Landorus-T can also be used, but has to beware of Blizzard.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Paralyzer": {
        "description": "<p>This Togekiss set works wonderfully on bulky offense teams due to its ability to Thunder Wave a majority of the opponents and slow them down for your sweepers. Air Slash is a great move in combination with Thunder Wave, granting the paraflinch combo. Not to mention Togekiss also has Serene Grace, being able to double the rate of flinching from Air Slash and therefore being able to keep the opponent immobile for longer. Follow Me is Togekiss's advantage over other Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus—the ability to lure attacks aimed at your partner and tank them with great special bulk is a huge selling point. Protect, as usual, is to defend Togekiss from attacks that are aimed at it. Helping Hand is a great move to give your partner a 50% power boost, allowing it to annihilate the already paralyzed opponents.</p> <p>The EVs are specially tailored to allow Togekiss to survive a multitude of powerful attacks, namely Rock Gem Terrakion's Rock Slide, Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor, Thundurus's Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Rotom-W's Thunderbolt. The HP EVs are given an odd number in order to reduce damage taken from sandstorm and hail. A Sitrus Berry is used to grant greater longevity, helping Togekiss take two attacks in one turn and is overall more useful than Leftovers in this metagame.</p> <p>Togekiss works great with bulky offensive Pokemon that benefit from opponents getting paralyzed, allowing them to go first and wreak havoc. These Pokemon include Metagross, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Kyurem-B. Hitmontop is once again a good partner with Intimidate to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense and can also use Wide Guard to protect Togekiss from the likes of Rock Slide, Blizzard, and Discharge.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Tailwind": {
        "description": "<p>Togekiss isn't only meant to function defensively; it can also go offensive thanks to its useful base 120 Special Attack. Tailwind is on the set in order to increase the Speed of the whole team, while Air Slash is for a reliable STAB and helpful flinches. Heat Wave is a good Fire-type move that can hit both opponents for decent damage and has a nice 30% chance to burn them. Aura Sphere is another reliable option to induce solid Fighting-type damage onto the opponent. Protect is useful in this instance to stall out Trick Room turns, while Helping Hand is good for boosting allies, especially when Togekiss's coverage is ineffective in that particular situation.</p> <p>208 HP EVs are used to give Togekiss an odd HP number to reduce damage from sandstorm and hail. 48 Speed EVs are given to allow Togekiss to outspeed 4 Speed base 85s, most notably Cresselia. Sitrus Berry is given to grant Togekiss greater longevity and to take more hits, while Flying Gem can give Togekiss a cool one-time damage boost. Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be used instead of Heat Wave for greater damage on individual opponents.</p> <p>Good teammates should have good coverage in tandem with Togekiss so they can take out bulkier opponents such as Cresselia. Tyranitar and Chandelure are good choices in this regard, and also benefit from Tailwind. Mamoswine and Heracross are also good partners—Mamoswine has good coverage and enjoys the flinches that Togekiss deals onto the opponent, while Heracross enjoys the Helping Hand support which permits it to OHKO Cresselia, and also beats the Ice- and Rock-types that trouble Togekiss. Hitmontop's Intimidate comes in handy to cover up Togekiss's weaker Defense, and its Wide Guard support grants protection against Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Discharge.</p>"

      "Shadow Tag Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Gothitelle is the only Pokemon with Shadow Tag, giving it a unique niche in the metagame. Gothitelle excels at trapping passive Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Amoonguss, shutting them down with Taunt and effectively turning the fight into a two-on-one. That said, Gothitelle can oftentimes find itself being a liability due to its passiveness and poor damage output. Additionally, trapping is not as powerful against more offensive teams, as they can ignore Gothitelle and focus down on its teammate. Finally, the lack of reliable setup sweepers in the tier means that Gothitelle's trapping oftentimes only results in a one for one trade, which might not outweigh Gothitelle's passiveness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taunt is necessary to shut down other passive support Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Jellicent, forcing them to use their weak attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trick Room is a strong speed control option, enabling Gothitelle's teammate or itself to beat opposing speed control. Helping Hand boosts the power of Gothitelle's teammate, mitigating Gothitelle's low damage output. Skill Swap can be used to give a teammate Shadow Tag, take away crucial abilities from the foe, such as Prankster from Thundurus, or reset abilities so they can be activated again, such as Intimidate. Giving a teammate Shadow Tag also allows Gothitelle to switch out to a more offensive teammate, mitigating its lackluster damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Calm nature ensures that Gothitelle survives a Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor with the rest dumped into Defense so that it can better tank strong physical attacks, such as Tyranitar's Crunch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gothitelle is best when trapping support Pokemon, so foes must be wary that Gothitelle can hard switch into them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Setup Pokemon, such as Suicune and Ferrothorn, are great teammates alongside Gothitelle because it can prevent the foe from switching from an unfavorable matchup, allowing its teammate to freely set up. Rain teams benefit greatly from Gothitelle's trapping because it can shut down Amoonguss and Jellicent, two common rain answers, allowing its teammate to remove them thus opening the door for Kingdra to sweep. Landorus-T is another excellent teammate, as U-turn allows Gothitelle to be brought in safely. Additionally, Gothitelle can use Skill Swap on Landorus-T, reactivating Intimidate and further weakening the opposing physical attackers. Finally, Pokemon with strong attacks, such as Dragon Gem Latios and Choice Band Kyurem-B, can benefit from Shadow Tag, allowing it to take out a crucial target.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other set options include Trick with Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. The idea is similar in that Gothitelle aims to shut down a passive support Pokemon by giving it a Choice item with Trick while trapping it but is typically less consistent due to Gothitelle needing to Trick away its item before it is able to support its teammate.</p> </li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Volcarona is a fringe setup sweeper with high offensive stats and decent coverage; however, it is weak without boosts, requires dedicated support to set up, is prone to opposing speed control, and is walled by a number of common threats, such as Jellicent and Heatran. Furthermore, Volcarona's typing leaves it extremely vulnerable to rain, Excadrill in sand, and Stealth Rock, making it often more trouble than is worth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quiver Dance is Volcarona's main niche, as even a single boost amplifies its already notable offensive stats to great heights, puts its Speed tier above Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T's, and lets it survive Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor. Heat Wave hits much of the metagame for neutral damage and OHKOes common Steel-types such as Excadrill, Scizor, and Genesect. It is especially fearsome at +1, where it can OHKO Metagross and 2HKO bulky neutral foes such as Thundurus and Landorus-T. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's best way of hitting foes that resist or shrug off Fire-type attacks: it OHKOes Latios and 2HKOes Cresselia, Tyranitar, and Gothitelle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lum Berry grants a one-time insurance and a setup opportunity against Thundurus's Thunder Wave and Amoonguss's Spore, both of which stop Volcarona from sweeping. Bug Gem guarantees an OHKO on Cresselia, Gothitelle, and Tyranitar with +1 Bug Buzz, as well as granting it an additional single-target nuke option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Volcarona thrives late-game once its checks are wittled down or removed, but setup opportunities are more limited due to Stealth Rock. Because Volcarona often has to take Stealth Rock damage, it favors setup opportunities against harmless foes such as Cresselia and Ferrothorn or in situations where a teammate can guarantee Volcarona's safety, such as with Fake Out or Rage Powder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amoonguss is a natural teammate for Volcarona, as it can redirect moves that would cripple Volcarona such as Thunder Wave and Genesect's Extreme Speed, and, more importantly, keeps it from being statused by Thundurus and opposing Amoonguss. Dark- and Electric-types such as Tyranitar and Thundurus beat Jellicent, which resists both of Volcarona's STAB attacks, with Tyranitar also disrupting rain and matching up well into Heatran. Bisharp beats Jellicent, and Defiant deters the common Stealth Rock setter Landorus-T from coming onto the field. Defiant Thundurus is able to do the same, with Superpower also beating Heatran. Water- and Fighting-types such as Jellicent and Conkeldurr also beat Heatran, which is as good as immune to Volcarona's attacks. Scrafty and Hitmontop provide Volcarona with Intimidate and Fake Out support to weaken Tyranitar and Excadrill and generate free setup turns for Volcarona, with the latter answering rain and Rock Slide with Wide Guard, and it sometimes runs Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock. Volcarona is also commonly paired with powerful wallbreakers such as Dragon Gem Latios and Choice Band Kyurem-B, as they punch holes in teams for it to clean up later.</p> </li> </ul>"

Additionally, Suicune's good defensive typing and excellent bulk make it difficult to take down after just one Calm Mind. That said, Suicune is held back by its reliance on Calm Mind, oftentimes doing little if it isn't able to set up. As a result, teams with Suicune are built to exploit certain matchups, making it a harder fit for most teams unlike Jellicent, which offers immediate utility on top of also being a solid defensive wincon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scald is Suicune's most reliable STAB attack, with the potential burn effect facilitating further setup opportunities against physical attackers like Tyranitar and Conkeldurr. Substitute blocks Toxic and allows Suicune to set up easier, since weak neutral attacks, such as Tyranitar's Rock Slide, do not break Suicune's Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item, since Suicune prefers staying on the field for many subsequent turns, therefore benefiting more from the passive healing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV spread ensures that Life Orb Kingdra's Muddy Water in rain does not break Substitute, with the rest dumped into Defense to allow Suicune to better tank strong physical attacks such as Choice Band Kyurem-B's Fusion Bolt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suicune needs Calm Mind to be effective, so its teammate should focus on removing foes that can deter setup, such as Thundurus and Choice Band Kyurem-B, or Pokemon that wall Suicune, such as Water Absorb Jellicent. Many of the attacks that hit Suicune for massive damage are burst options like Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor. Forcing the opponent to use their boosted attacks on a different Pokemon lets Suicune set up easier in future turns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intimidate users are mandatory next to Suicune, as its effect increases Suicune's bulk and makes it more difficult for foes to take out. Notably, -1 Landorus-T and Tyranitar do not break Substitute with Earthquake and Crunch, respectively. Landorus-T, therefore, is an excellent teammate, capable of weakening physical attackers with Intimidate, threatening Thundurus, and pivoting into Suicune with U-turn for a good setup opportunity. Hitmontop is another good Intimidate user that can facilitate setup opportunities with Fake Out. Heatran beats Grass-types, such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, that can deter setup. Gothitelle excels at trapping slower support Pokemon such as Jellicent and Amoonguss, allowing its partner to eliminate them and opening the door for Suicune to win or facilitating further setup opportunities for Suicune by locking the opponent in an unfavorable position.</p> </li> </ul>"

All in all, its typing and being the only reliable Fire-type make Heatran a mainstay in the metagame.</li> <li>Earth Power is only for opposing Heatran but can do reliable damage against Fire-resistant Pokemon, such as Tyranitar and Kingdra.</li> <li>Heatran aims to set up Substitute as quickly as possible, protecting it from moves that can OHKO it, such as Latios's Hidden Power Ground and Landorus-T's Earthquake, while allowing it to freely chip the opponent's team with Heat Wave. With the lack of abundant Fire-resistant Pokemon, Heatran oftentimes can exert immense offensive pressure with its Heat Wave by forcing Protect and switches, allowing it to generate free opportunities to set up Substitute.</li> <li>Heatran benefits greatly from Thundurus. In addition to Thundurus checking Water-types, its Prankster Thunder Wave can allow Heatran to outspeed threats, such as Latios, and set up Substitute while fishing for a full paralysis. Tyranitar is another excellent teammate due to its ability to check opposing Heatran, Thundurus; which can stop Heatran's Substitute with Taunt; Latios, and Cresselia. Heatran's Substitute can also stall for extra turns, allowing the sand damage to add up on the opposing team while Heatran recovers HP through Leftovers, thanks to its Steel typing. Amoonguss can facilitate Substitute with Spore or redirect super effective hits with Rage Powder.

This allows it to be played more aggressively to take advantage of the small number of Fire-resistant Pokemon in the metagame.</li> <li>Shuca Berry allows Heatran to tank a Ground-type attack that would otherwise OHKO it, notably improving the matchup against Latios and opposing Heatran. Earth Power is mainly to hit opposing Heatran super effectively. Flash Cannon is a second STAB attack that does better damage against Kyurem-B, Latios, and Tyranitar. Heatran can opt for more Speed if necessary. For example, 84 Speed EVs allow it to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T under Tailwind.</li> <li>Generally, this set likes to take advantage of Heatran's typing to generate free attacking opportunities by safely switching into resisted attacks. For example, Heatran counters the common Steel-types, such as Metagross and Genesect, so it can be played aggressively by switching directly into them, giving Heatran a free Heat Wave chance.</li> <li>Similarly to Substitute Heatran, Shuca Berry Heatran benefits greatly from Thundurus due to its speed control with Prankster Thunder Wave and its ability to check Water-types, such as Jellicent. Latios and Cresselia are also excellent teammates, as they can threaten Fighting-types, Landorus-T, and opposing Heatran while also having access to speed control. Since this set is worse against rain, Heatran appreciates teammates that can deter Kingdra, such as Jellicent. Finally, Tyranitar benefits from Heatran's ability to remove Steel-types and Amoonguss, and it can deter rain with Sand Stream and threaten opposing Jellicent, Latios, Cresselia, and Heatran.</li> <li>On dedicated Trick Room teams, Heatran can be used as a strong wallbreaker with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA, a Quiet nature, 0 Speed IVs, Fire Gem or Charcoal for the item, and a moveset of Eruption, Earth Power, Heat Wave, and Protect.</li> </ul>"

Cresselia uses its bulk, many speed control options, and supporting moves to assist its teammates. Although it has a rather weak Special Attack stat, this is partially mitigated by access to a reliable combination of moves with which it hits many of the top threats in the metagame super effectively. All in all, Cresselia is a threat if left alone and is a Pokemon that all teams must have an answer to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psychic is a STAB attack that can 2HKO Amoonguss, Conkeldurr, and Hitmontop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ice Beam is used to hit common Ice-weak foes, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Latios, super effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types, notably Heatran and Metagross, that resist Cresselia's other moves super effectively. Hidden Power Fire is used on teams that wish to improve their matchup against Scizor, Genesect, and Ferrothorn.</p> </li> <li> <p>The last moveslot is typically reserved for a speed control option, although the choice depends on the team. Thunder Wave is the most reliable, as its speed control benefits every type of team. Trick Room is an excellent option for teams with many slow Pokemon, such as Heatran, Conkeldurr, and Tyranitar. Trick Room can also be used to reset opposing Trick Room, ensuring Cresselia and its teammates keep the upper hand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expert Belt takes advantage of Cresselia's ability to hit common metagame threats super effectively by boosting the power of these hits without any drawbacks. Notably, it allows Cresselia to 2HKO Latios and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>The spread maximizes Cresselia's damage output, with a Timid nature ensuring that it outspeeds unboosted Adamant Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cresselia's main role is to take heavy attacks and threaten a super effective hit on many of the top Pokemon in the tier. Keep in mind that Cresselia's damage output is rather poor and can have trouble OHKOing even with super effective moves, so most of the time, it will be weakening the Pokemon for its partner to clean up later. Cresselia's bulk allows it to tank many hits so it can be kept on the field longer to scare off these threats from coming in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cresselia is great on sand teams because it threatens common sand answers like Landorus-T and Conkeldurr, has Levitate, allowing Excadrill to freely use Earthquake, and has access to speed control for Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar can beat Jellicent and opposing Cresselia, which shrug off any of Cresselia's attacks, and Excadrill beats opposing Tyranitar. Landorus-T is another excellent teammate, as it also threatens Tyranitar and can freely use Earthquake, and Intimidate allows Cresselia to better tank physical attacks. Heatran benefits from Cresselia threatening Landorus-T, Conkeldurr, and opposing Heatran, thus allowing it to set up Substitute more easily.

Helping Hand boosts the power of Cresselia's partner, allowing Pokemon, such as Excadrill and Heatran, to pick up KOs that they normally couldn't. Sunny Day can be used as an emergency check to rain teams. These support options can be used in place of one of Cresselia's coverage moves. Icy Wind is an alternative speed control option. Other sets include a Cresselia with more defensive investment to focus more as bulky support, Calm Mind with a defensive EV spread, which can be a win condition, and minimum speed for dedicated Trick Room teams.</p> </li> </ul>"

That said, Politoed isn't useless, in part due to a great defensive typing alongside a plethora of support moves. Scald is a reliable STAB attack, benefiting from Politoed's ability. Toxic is great to hinder Jellicent and Gastrodon, allowing Politoed to passively cripple two of Kingdra's most viable checks. Helping Hand helps mitigate Politoed's lack of offensive presence and is especially devastating alongside Kingdra's Muddy Water. Encore disrupts or punishes foes that try to take advantage of Politoed's passiveness by setting up a Substitute, or it can lock them into an undesirable move such as Protect. Alternatively, Hydro Pump can be used as a stronger STAB attack.</li> <li>Eject Button is the item of choice, because it allows Politoed to immediately bring in a more offensive partner after setting rain. Eject Button also allows Politoed to be safely preserved in case it needs to set rain again. Sitrus Berry can be used instead to increase its longevity.</li> <li>The offensive EV investment allows Politoed to OHKO 4 HP Choice Scarf Landorus-T. The Special Defense investment lives a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios with the remaining EVs dumped into Defense.</li> <li>Politoed's one job is to set rain.

        "description": "<ul> <li>Unlike defensive Politoed this set aims to maximize an offensive presence, pressuring the opposing team with its strong rain-boosted STAB attacks. Politoed's role, however, is still to set rain with Drizzle, so the choice between the defensive and offensive sets oftentimes comes down to personal preference.</li> <li>Hydro Pump is the strongest Water-type attack Politoed has access to and can do massive damage under rain. Scald is a reliable Water-type attack for when accuracy is preferred. Ice Beam can hit Water resistances, such as Latios and Amoonguss, super effectively. Toxic can be used to punish common bulky switch-ins such as Jellicent and Kyurem-B. Hidden Power Grass is a more offensive option to punish common Water-type switch-ins such as Jellicent and Gastrodon. Protect should only be used in combination with Water Gem.</li> <li>Choice Specs further boosts Politoed's power, while Water Gem trades the consistent power boost for the flexibility of switching moves. Both items, however, are equally valuable and the choice oftentimes comes down to player preference.</li> <li>This spread aims to maximize Politoed's damage output. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 204 SpA / 56 SpD can be used to survive Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios at the cost of slightly decreased power.</li> <li>Although Politoed's main job is still to set rain, it still has enough offensive presence to allow it to stay on the field, since it is not as big of a momentum sap as defensive Politoed. Due to the lack of defensive investment, if the opponent has another weather setter, it is best to play safely and preserve Politoed in order to win the weather war.</li> <li>Kingdra is a mandatory teammate to take advantage of rain. Pokemon that threaten or answer common rain checks, such as Jellicent, Thundurus, Amoonguss, and Dragon-types, are excellent teammates. Thundurus-T can threaten Jellicent, Amoonguss, and Thundurus. Steel-types, such as Metagross and Genesect, can threaten Kyurem-B and Latios while also benefitting from Politoed's ability to threaten Heatran. Finally, Thundurus can threaten Jellicent and Amoonguss while also offering speed control with its Prankster Thunder Wave to mitigate Politoed's low Speed.</li> </ul>"

Additionally, it struggles heavily to beat some of the metagame's most common Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Thundurus, and is hard-countered by Heatran.</li> <li>Bug Bite is a solid second Technician-boosted STAB attack that is stronger than Bullet Punch and can steal berries from common Pokemon such as Cresselia and Amoonguss.</li> <li>Steel Gem is the preferred item, because it powers up Bullet Punch, Scizor's most commonly used attack, notably allowing it to OHKO Latios after a Swords Dance boost.

If that isn't enough, a strong spread Water-type attack in Muddy Water makes Kingdra difficult to switch into, thus solidifying it as one of the most fearsome threats in the metagame.</li> <li>Muddy Water is a strong spread STAB attack with increased damage in rain. Draco Meteor is another STAB attack that can hit Dragon-types that resist Water super effectively, such as Latios and Kyurem-B. It's also a strong attack for Pokemon immune to Water, such as Gastrodon and Jellicent. Substitute most importantly blocks debilitating statuses, such as Thunder Wave paralysis, and it allows Kingdra to tank a hit with minimal damage. Hydro Pump can be used over Substitute if the damage is preferred, but this will greatly hinder the Thundurus and Amoonguss matchups.</li> <li>Water Gem is an option if using Hydro Pump to give Kingdra a nuke that is capable of OHKOing Thundurus. This, however, is fairly situational and weakens Kingdra's overall damage output, so Life Orb is the better option in most cases.</li> <li>A Timid nature is an option to outspeed or Speed tie opposing Kingdra, although it lowers Kingdra's damage output.</li> <li>Kingdra's combination of Speed and power can allow it to function both as a wallbreaker or a cleaner. Most of the time, Kingdra will be using Muddy Water and only uses Draco Meteor on threats that it can KO, such as Dragon-types or a weakened Amoonguss, since Kingdra will likely have to switch out afterwards.</li> <li>With how powerful Kingdra can be, teams with Kingdra are oftentimes built solely around supporting it. Politoed is a mandatory to set rain. Teammates that can threaten Thundurus, such as Thundurus-T or Kyurem-B, or redirect Thunder Wave, such as Amoonguss, are important to prevent Kingdra from being paralyzed. Thundurus-T and Kyurem-B both also threaten Amoonguss and Jellicent, which are two of the most common answers for Kingdra. Pokemon that can threaten Tyranitar, such as Genesect, Scizor, and Landorus-T, are important to ensure that rain stays on the field. Landorus-T also threatens Thundurus and can also pivot with U-turn, allowing one to switch Kingdra in safely. Finally, Grass-types, such as Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Shaymin-S, are common partners to threaten Water-types that resist Muddy Water, with Ferrothorn aiding with rain teams' often poor Trick Room matchups.</li> </ul>"

Sand amplifies Tyranitar's Special Defense, letting it function as an emergency check to rain - albeit not a foolproof one due to its Water weakness. The residual damage from sand chips away at foes, breaks Focus Sash, and negates Leftovers healing. However, Tyranitar is susceptible to Intimidate, and its typing makes it weak to common types, such as Ground, Fighting, and Steel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rock Slide is a reliable spread STAB attack, while Stone Edge can be used for more power, notably allowing Tyranitar to OHKO bulky Thundurus. Crunch is a secondary STAB attack that hits Latios, Jellicent, and Cresselia super effectively. Low Kick rounds out Tyranitar's attacks, allowing it to hit opposing Tyranitar and Heatran super effectively. Stealth Rock allows for additional residual damage and is important in helping Tyranitar pick up KOs, notably putting bulky Thundurus and Jellicent in range of Rock Slide and Crunch, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive a Fighting-type hit that it could not otherwise, such as opposing Tyranitar's Low Kick, -1 Hitmontop's Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat, or Landorus-T's Superpower.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tyranitar typically prefers to be sent out as early as possible so it can control the field with sand and Stealth Rock. Tyranitar's bulk lets it tank neutral hits fairly well, allowing it to trade with Pokemon such as Latios and Heatran. Against opposing weather setters, Tyranitar should be preserved as much as possible to win the weather war.</p> </li> <li> <p>Excadrill is a great offensive teammate, taking advantage of sand to turn into a fearsome sweeper that can outspeed the entire metagame. Thundurus's Thunder Wave slows down faster threats for Tyranitar, forming an annoying combination alongside Rock Slide's flinch chance. In return, Tyranitar can threaten opposing Latios and Kyurem-B for Thundurus. Latios appreciates Tyranitar's ability to threaten opposing Latios, Thundurus, and Kyurem-B, while Latios threatens Landorus-T and Conkeldurr for Tyranitar. Jellicent and Tyranitar form a formidable defensive core, with Jellicent being able to cover Fighting-, Steel-, and Water-types that threaten Tyranitar, while Tyranitar beats opposing Jellicent, Kyurem-B, and Thundurus. The residual damage from sand also benefits Jellicent as a defensive win condition by chipping away at the foe's HP, while Jellicent can recover off the damage. Finally, Conkeldurr appreciates Tyranitar being able to beat Jellicent and Psychic-types.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tyranitar has a vast movepool, allowing it to run different coverage moves based on a team's needs, such as Ice Beam, which OHKOes Landorus-T when run alongside a Brave nature. Choice Scarf lets Tyranitar outrun faster threats, such as Latios and Kyurem-B, and OHKO them. Other resistance Berries can be used for specific teams. Babiri Berry with Fire Blast can be helpful on teams that are weak to Steel-types, while Shuca Berry with Ice Beam can be useful on teams weak to Ground-types.</p> </li> </ul>"

Crunch is another STAB attack that does massive damage to Dark-weak foes that fail to pressure Tyranitar back, such as Cresselia and Jellicent. Pursuit lets Tyranitar trap foes that want to switch to generate offensive pressure, such as Latios after a Draco Meteor and Cresselia, as it 2HKOes them even if they don't switch out. Superpower is an alternative over Stone Edge to OHKO Heatran and opposing Tyranitar, and it is preferred over Low Kick for its higher Base Power.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thundurus is an excellent teammate due to Thunder Wave and its ability to threaten Landorus-T. Latios is another great teammate by threatening Fighting-types and Landorus-T while also supporting Tyranitar with Tailwind. Tyranitar supports Latios by threatening Thundurus, Kyurem-B, and opposing Latios. Jellicent and Cresselia set Trick Room while threatening common Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T and Hitmontop.

Rain teams also appreciate Breloom's ability to answer bulky Water-types, most notably Jellicent and Gastrodon, and Kyurem-B. Heatran is an excellent teammate due to its ability to threaten Amoonguss, while Breloom can facilitate Substitute with Spore and beat common Heatran checks such as Jellicent, Tyranitar, and Kyurem-B.

Additionally, it is immune to Intimidate and has a sky-high Attack stat that can be further boosted with Meteor Mash. This allows Metagross to snowball behind a Substitute, giving it the opportunity to quickly take over games. Metagross, however, is held back by a lackluster Speed tier, allowing common Pokemon, such as Thundurus and Heatran, to outspeed and break its Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p>Meteor Mash is the preferred STAB attack due to its Base Power, doing significant damage to Tyranitar and Kyurem-B, and chance of raising Metagross's Attack. Zen Headbutt is a secondary STAB attack that hits Amoonguss super effectively and does reliable damage to Steel-resistant foes such as Thundurus and Jellicent. Earthquake hits Heatran, a common Metagross counter, and opposing Metagross super effectively.

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias is outclassed in most roles that it can perform in Doubles due to the omnipresent Psychic-types, Cresselia and Latios. Cresselia usually pulls off a support role better courtesy of its mind boggling bulk, something Latias can only dream of rivaling. Latios, on the other hand, largely outclasses Latias as an offensive Pokemon, due to its higher Special Attack stat. That said, thanks to its good bulk, useful resistances to common attacking types—Water, Fire, Electric, and Fighting—and Speed, Latias is one of the best Tailwind setters in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you could describe Latias's movepool with a single word, it would be 'colossal'. That said, even with plenty of attacking and supportive options, there are few if any combinations Latias can use as effectively as the moves listed on the main set. There are two item options worth mentioning though: Yache Berry and Dragon Gem. Yache Berry is fairly self-explanatory; it helps Latias in countering Blizzard teams and taking Ice-type attacks comfortably in general. Dragon Gem, on the other hand, seems like complete madness, but because Latias secures OHKOs on Breloom, Kyurem-B, and Chandelure with it, it is a perfectly viable option if you wish to fling an extra hard-hitting Draco Meteor in your opponent's direction.</p> <p>As Latias is first and foremost a supporter, additional moves that help it support naturally get the first mentions. Icy Wind can be used as a different form of speed control, but it is often better used by more bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. Heal Pulse is an interesting option that lets Latias heal a teammate, but should be used with caution; it will hit the opponent if your teammate goes down. Safeguard also deserves a mention, as it prevents the opponent from repeatedly using Thunder Wave, which is usually one of Tailwind's worst enemies. Reflect and Light Screen seem great for Latias on paper, but it is no Cresselia, and therefore has a hard time setting said screens up. Sunny Day and Rain Dance are options to help either support your weather team or disrupt problematic opposing weather teams. Role Play can also help perform this, as well as copying useful abilities such as Intimidate, but it is generally hard to consistently use effectively due to the move's gimmicky nature. Magic Coat is useful for bouncing back Taunt and Thunder Wave, but it is very situational. Swagger can be used in tandem with a teammate carrying a Lum Berry to boost its Attack for free; it can also be used to disrupt the opposition, but relying on coin flips is usually a terrible idea.</p> <p>Latias can also pack a punch, so a fully offensive spread with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature is viable due to Latias having more bulk than Latios. The main moves for this set would be Draco Meteor, Psyshock, Hidden Power Fire, and Protect. Thunderbolt and Thunder could also be used to hit many bulky Water-types hard, and Grass Knot and Energy Ball could do the same against different Water-types. You could also opt to use Psychic over Psyshock, but because most Pokemon in Doubles invest in Special Defense rather than Defense, Psyshock hits most targets harder. Finally, Latias's humongous list of other options ends with a rather peculiar option: Mist Ball. This move works as a STAB move and a pseudo-Snarl at the same time, but Psyshock is a more consistent STAB Psychic-type attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types, such as Metagross and Bisharp, have no trouble walling Latias's attacks and can do a good amount of damage in return. Bug-types, such as Heracross, Genesect, and Scizor, can easily KO it with their STAB moves, and in Volcarona's case, even set up on Latias. Thundurus and Tornadus are problematic if Latias needs to set up Tailwind, as they can both Taunt it, the latter also being able to deal a big number with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Another huge problem for Latias is bulky or fast Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Weavile, as they can take it out with a STAB move of choice. Most Trick Room setters can both wall Latias and undermine its speed control, especially bulky setters such as Cresselia and Dusclops. Chandelure succeeds in both setting up Trick Room and dealing super effective damage, making it one of the big thorns in Latias's side. Latios will win against Latias if it gets lucky; it needs to win the Speed tie and hope that Latias doesn't carry Haban Berry, but if the situation is so, Latias gets OHKOed easily by Draco Meteor, boosted or not. Finally, Sableye is a Pokemon that will make Latias rip its (non-existent) hair out, due to its ability to shut Latias down with Taunt and burn the potential physical attackers standing at its side.</p>",

Draco Meteor might seem odd on a support Pokemon, and Dragon Pulse looks a bit more appealing on paper, but Draco Meteor provides fantastic utility by being able to OHKO many popular Dragon-types in Doubles and makes sure Latias can perform an alternative role as opposed to just being a fully support-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>To show the benefit of using Draco Meteor over Dragon Pulse, here are some important damage calculations:</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Salamence: 119.27 - 140.96%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Hydreigon: 109.2 - 129.44%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Garchomp: 104.46 - 124.02%</p> <p>Draco Meteor vs. 0 / 4 Latios: 100.33 - 118.27%</p> <p>The third slot is another move that prevents Latias from becoming dead weight after using Tailwind or Draco Meteor. Helping Hand is extremely useful, as it can boost Latias's teammates' moves after Tailwind has been set up, helping it fill the role of a supporter more effectively. Protect is very useful in the last slot for playing mindgames and is a general staple on many Pokemon in Doubles, but because Latias is as bulky as it is, Protect is not nearly as necessary as it would be on an offensive Pokemon. Psyshock is another viable option, as it hits common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Breloom for solid damage.</p> <p>The given spread allows Latias to use its amazing Speed tier to outpace key threats such as Terrakion, Salamence, and Garchomp. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD might look appealing for additional bulk, but Latias's Speed is what really sets it apart from Cresselia, and it is much harder to set Tailwind or use Thunder Wave if Latias is slow. Sitrus Berry is the main item, as it helps with Latias's overall longevity, but Haban Berry helps it deal with opposing Dragon-types much more effectively, as it can survive any Dragon-type attack and retaliate by either setting up Tailwind or hitting back hard with a Draco Meteor. Dragon Pulse could work over Draco Meteor, but it misses out on the important OHKOs listed above. Psychic is an option to hit Pokemon such as Breloom and Landorus-T for more damage, but Psyshock hits most Pokemon harder due to the metagame being more specially defensive in general.</p> <p>First and foremost when it comes to picking teammates, know that anything with middling to high Speed appreciates the speed control support from Latias. Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Heracross, and Victini are all good Pokemon to use on Tailwind teams and should therefore be considered for use alongside Latias. Even more notable Pokemon under this category are Ground-types that benefit from Tailwind. Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine are all fantastic teammates, as they can freely use Earthquake due to Latias's immunity to it. Steel-types synergize extremely well with Latias, as they resist attacks that hit Latias for super effective damage, so Pokemon such as Scizor and Metagross are good teammates as well. Finally, teams weak to sun and rain appreciate the presence of Latias, as its presence alone will be a thorn in the side of those archetypes.</p>"

This, alongside Hidden Power Ground to cover Heatran and Metagross, makes Latios difficult to reliably switch into and a threat that every team must prepare for.</li> <li>Psychic is another reliable STAB attack that can hit common Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Conkeldurr, without the drawback of Draco Meteor. Alternatively, teams can opt for Tailwind over Psychic if they require the speed control.</li> <li>Both Dragon Gem and Life Orb function to improve Latios's damage output. Dragon Gem gives Latios a one-time Draco Meteor nuke. The idea behind the Dragon Gem set is that Latios uses Draco Meteor most often and only uses Psychic or Hidden Power Ground against super effective targets such as Conkeldurr and Heatran, respectively, which already take a ton of damage even without a Life Orb boost. Given how common residual damage is, such as from Stealth Rock or sand, the lack of recoil with Dragon Gem can allow Latios to better tank hits, such as Landorus-T's U-turn, Excadrill's Iron Head, or Choice Band Genesect's Extreme Speed.</li> <li>On the other hand, Life Orb gives a boost to all of Latios's attacks, thus allowing it to function better as a wallbreaker by dishing out more damage to key metagame threats, such as Heatran, Metagross, and Amoonguss. Additionally, Life Orb gives Latios more consistent Draco Meteor damage. Overall, either set provides more or less the same value to a team, and deciding which item to use oftentimes comes down to personal playstyle.</li> <li>Latios's unique combination of speed and power can allow it to function as a reliable wallbreaker while also being able to outspeed and threaten much of the format's slower attackers, such as Kyurem-B.</li> <li>Latios requires minimal direct support due to its ability to fit on a variety of teams, although it does benefit from teammates that can remove Tyranitar, such as Conkeldurr, Landorus-T, and Genesect.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Genesect and Ferrothorn, although Latios will be slower than opposing Latios due to HP Fire IVs.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set with Trick over Protect and Ice Beam over Psychic can be used as a speedy revenge killer, allowing Latios to outspeed and OHKO opposing unboosted Latios, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T while enabling it to cripple bulkier Pokemon, such as Cresselia or Jellicent, with Trick.</li> </ul>"

However, Deoxys-A is extremely susceptible to speed control such as against rain, priority attackers, and Cresselia, as its paltry defenses leave it easily OHKOed by nearly any attack. Deoxys-A's single target damage is telegraphed and its pure Psychic typing doesn't fare well against common bulky Steel- and Psychic-types, which can punish the -2 Deoxys-A by forcing it off the field. As Deoxys-A is too frail to switch in at any time, it often functions as a revenge killer rather than a breaker and finds itself competing with Psychic-types with better offensive coverage or utility such as Latios and Cresselia.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psycho Boost is a single target nuke that OHKOes nearly the entire unresisted metagame, including Choice Band Kyurem-B and Thundurus after Stealth Rock. Superpower OHKOes Heatran and OHKOes both Chople Berry Tyranitar and Substitute Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Beam is Deoxys-A's best way of hitting Latios while also OHKOing Landorus-T without having to commit to Psycho Boost's Special Attack drop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Life Orb is necessary to hit many offensive benchmarks such as OHKOing Heatran with Superpower and Latios with Ice Beam. Focus Sash can be used to take a lethal hit, but it is not recommended, as it is easily broken by sand damage and Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV spread lets Deoxys-A outspeed max Speed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO Heatran with Superpower, with the remaining EVs invested in Special Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deoxys-A wants to use its Psycho Boost as much as possible to punch holes in the opponent's team early on, preventing Landorus-T from getting a favorable pivoting opportunity, and so its teammates can clean up late-game. However, it must remain wary of common priority users, such as Choice Band Extreme Speed Genesect, Bullet Punch Scizor, Sucker Punch Bisharp, and even Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, if Deoxys-A is chipped down from Life Orb recoil and sand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deoxys-A struggles against Steel-types such as Metagross and Genesect, so Fire-types like Heatran are necessary teammates. Landorus-T is another great partner, capable of taking out Thundurus with Stone Edge, preventing it from using Thunder Wave, leveraging Intimidate to weaken sand teams where Excadrill outspeeds Deoxys-A, and setting up Stealth Rock to put foes, such as Kyurem-B and Thundurus, in Psycho Boost range. Amoonguss also pairs well, as it can redirect common attacks that would eliminate Deoxys-A and Spore faster threats, such as Kingdra, and Trick Room users, such as Cresselia and Jellicent, to retain the Speed advantage. Thundurus also helps Deoxys-A keep its Speed advantage, as it can Thunder Wave faster foes like Kingdra and Taunt Trick Room setters. Genesect synergizes well offensively, as it threatens Dark- and Psychic-types with U-turn with which it can pivot safely into Deoxys-A. Furthermore, its Extreme Speed can either weaken foes for Deoxys-A to pick off with Psycho Boost or pick off foes Deoxys-A weakens, cleaning late-game.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also has good bulk, only being OHKOed by Grass-types and Outrage from Choice Band Kyurem-B. Gastrodon has access to reliable coverage, hitting common metagame staples, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Heatran, super effectively. This makes Gastrodon one of the best anti-metagame Pokemon, capable of countering common threats as well as being a soft check to rain, deterring Kingdra from spamming Muddy Water. Gastrodon's damage output, however, is low even on super effective hits. This could be mitigated with Storm Drain boosts but it is not particularly reliable. More importantly, it faces competition with Jellicent as a bulky Water-type, which has more utility and is an easier fit for most teams, relegating Gastrodon to only specific team compositions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gastrodon hits the entire metagame for at least neutral damage with Earth Power and Ice Beam, the former being a reliable STAB attack that OHKOes Heatran and the latter hitting Flying-types, such as Landorus-T and Thundurus, super effectively. Recover increases Gastrodon's longevity. Toxic supplements Gastrodon's low damage output, allowing it to put bulky Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Cresselia, on a timer. Scald or Muddy Water can be used for a Water-type STAB attack but does not hit any relevant threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is the preferred item to give Gastrodon instant recovery, allowing it to stay on the field longer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV spread lets Gastrodon survive consecutive Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor and has a high chance of surviving Life Orb Conkeldurr's Hammer Arm, while the Special Attack investment allows Gastrodon to OHKO Substitute Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gastrodon likes to control the field by using its excellent coverage and the threat of Toxic to deter common Pokemon from switching in. It also has an excellent matchup against Thundurus, rain and sand teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gastrodon prefers strong teammates that can make up for its potential low damage output. Genesect and Metagross benefit from Gastrodon's ability to beat Heatran, Thundurus, and Landorus-T. In return, Genesect and Metagross can both threaten Kyurem-B, which can shrug off Gastrodon's attacks and threaten a KO with a Choice Band Outrage. Heatran is another excellent teammate, as it can beat Amoonguss, while Gastrodon is able to threaten Landorus-T and opposing Heatran in return. Gastrodon can also redirect Water-type attacks, allowing Heatran to potentially set up a Substitute in front of Jellicent. Landorus-T's Intimidate can increase Gastrodon's longevity. In return, Gastrodon can redirect Water-type attacks and threaten opposing Landorus-T. The double Ground-type core also shuts down Thundurus, supporting the rest of Gastrodon's team, especially those that are more susceptible to Thundurus.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, its typing also leaves it weak to Stealth Rock and many common attacking types, and its bulk and dependence on Trick Room leave it prone to being picked off by strong neutral hits, which means it isn't as effective in weather wars as the other setters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grass Gem-boosted Wood Hammer OHKOes Tyranitar and Politoed, forcing them to switch out and leaving Abomasnow with the weather advantage. It also OHKOes Jellicent. Abomasnow's Snow Warning guarantees Blizzard always hits both foes, notably OHKOing Landorus-T and 2HKOing Latios. Ice Shard is an option to chip away at the aforementioned Ice-weak foes whenever Abomasnow is at a Speed disadvantage.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV spread lets Abomasnow take a Low Kick from bulky Tyranitar and OHKO it with a Grass Gem-boosted Wood Hammer. The rest of the EVs are spent in Special Attack. 0 Speed IVs are necessary to move before Tyranitar in Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>Abomasnow uses Wood Hammer as its Grass-type attack to guarantee the OHKO on Tyranitar, while other options like Energy Ball and Giga Drain do not. Another option for Abomasnow is Life Orb with a Quiet nature, making it a stronger Trick Room attacker that can OHKO Latios with Blizzard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Jellicent is a most natural partner for Abomasnow, as it sets up Trick Room and beats Heatran, which resists all of Abomasnow's attacks. Jellicent may even opt into a more offensive set such as Water Gem Water Spout, as Abomasnow beats common counterplay such as Tyranitar and opposing Jellicent, making a powerful offensive duo with their combined spread attacks. Cresselia may be used as an additional Trick Room setter that can boost Abomasnow's middling damage output with Helping Hand or run Expert Belt as to beat Fighting-types like Conkeldurr. Heatran is another natural partner, as Abomasnow beats Water-types and Latios and Heatran beats Steel-types such as Metagross and Scizor. Eruption Heatran works especially well, as nearly nothing can switch into a Blizzard and Charcoal-boosted Eruption at the same time. Slow Fighting-types like Conkeldurr and Scrafty work well in Trick Room and provide another way of beating Kyurem-B and Steel-types, especially Heatran.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, its middling Speed tier, numerous weaknesses against common attacking types, and offensive shortcomings in its lack of damage and susceptibility to Intimidate leave it as a very niche Pokemon in the metagame, one that is often better replaced by Kyurem-B or Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>Icicle Crash OHKOes Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Latios. Icicle Spear is an option to OHKO Focus Sash Landorus-T but is less consistent against Thundurus and Latios, as it requires 3 hits to OHKO them. Earthquake OHKOes Heatran and 2HKOes Metagross and Tyranitar. Ice Shard gets around Mamoswine's mediocre Speed tier to hit Landorus-T and Latios first, 2HKOing them and circumventing Focus Sash Landorus-T, while Stealth Rock grants it some utility and chips foes to get them in KO range of its teammates' attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus Sash allows Mamoswine to guarantee a damage trade one time and is especially useful for Mamoswine as it isn't affected by sand and hail damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other options include Superpower to OHKO Tyranitar without Chople Berry.

Support from strong Dragon-types such as Dragon Gem Latios also helps put other foes in range of Mamoswine's middling attacks. Heatran is a good teammate because it deals with Metagross, which outtrades Mamoswine despite Earthquake, and non-Ground-weak Steel-types in Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Genesect. Conkeldurr also deals with Ferrothorn and hits Kyurem-B and Excadrill, who beat Mamoswine.

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W manages to stand out as a premier Water-type in yet another tier thanks to its great typing, bulk, offenses, and ability. Its dual STAB moves coming off of its base 105 Special Attack stat allow it to threaten common Pokemon in weather teams, and from a defensive standpoint, its typing in tandem with its good bulk allows it to check dangerous Pokemon such as Heatran and Kingdra. Its ability in Levitate is the icing on the cake, allowing it to both easily check and partner well with Earthquake users such as Excadrill and Landorus. Sadly for Rotom-W, however, it faces competition from other Electric-types in the tier, most notably Zapdos and Thundurus, who are more powerful and have cooler support options such as Tailwind and priority Thunder Wave. Thankfully, however, Rotom-W's access to Hydro Pump gives it a niche these other threats do not have, allowing it to maim the Ground-types looking to absorb an Electric-type attack. All in all, Rotom-W is a top tier threat that every team should be prepared for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-W can utilize a ChestoRest set to heal off damage and cure itself of status, but the lack of a support move can hinder its effectiveness. A Rain Dance set can be effective to aid Politoed in winning weather wars. Sunny Day might seem like a strange option, but thanks to Rotom-W's typing and bulk, it can take hits from common rain attackers, set up Sunny Day, and maul Politoed with a STAB Thunderbolt. A Life Orb attacker set can be used to grant Rotom-W more attacking power and flexibility, but the recoil hampers its ability to check important threats. Light Screen can be used to pad the Special Defense of Rotom-W and its teammates. A Rindo Berry can be used to let Rotom-W survive a hit from Shaymin-S or Ferrothorn, letting it respond with the appropriate status move. Finally, Electroweb is an interesting option that lets Rotom-W grant more speed control to its team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass- and Dragon-types that resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves make for good counters to it. Abomasnow can easily switch into all of Rotom-W's moves and hit it hard with a STAB Giga Drain. Ferrothorn and Virizion also switch in with ease and can quickly dispatch Rotom-W, although they both must watch out for Will-O-Wisp. While Breloom and Shaymin-S don't enjoy taking one of Rotom-W's attacks, they can outspeed and KO with Bullet Seed and Seed Flare, respectively. Amoonguss is able to switch into Rotom-W with impunity, redirect its attacks with Rage Powder, put it to sleep with Spore, and heal off the damage with Regenerator. Latios, Latias, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B can all shrug off attacks from Rotom-W and deal huge amounts of damage back with their Dragon-type STAB moves. Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves. Although it can do little in return of Toxic, it grants its partner full protection from Rotom-W's Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Rotom-W makes an excellent offensive support Pokemon and can use its good bulk and offensive power to check powerful Pokemon such as Excadrill, Kingdra, and Tyranitar. Hydro Pump is a great attacking move here, as it is very powerful and has excellent neutral coverage. It also decimates Ground-types and Tyranitar, both of which wouldn't mind taking a Thunderbolt. The fact that it gets a boost under rain allows Rotom-W to be both a nice rain partner and an even better rain check. Thunderbolt is a nice secondary STAB move, mauling the bulky Water-types that would otherwise not be threatened by Rotom-W. Thunderbolt also gives Rotom-W a more accurate attacking option than Hydro Pump. Thunder Wave is used here in order to cripple faster Pokemon and allow Rotom-W to better support its team. It is also nice to give Rotom-W a way to hit Pokemon that otherwise would not be very threatened by it, such as Latios. Will-O-Wisp is nice to cripple physical attackers, but paralysis is generally a more useful status condition.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry is the main item on this set because it helps boost Rotom-W's survivabiity, allowing it to continue to be a threat to the opponent as well as granting it the ability to take multiple hits in a single turn when needed. Alternatively, Rotom-W may hold a Water Gem or an Electric Gem to power one of its STAB moves to net quicker KOs. The investment in bulk is used to let Rotom-W survive a Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from Ludicolo and either cripple it with paralysis or hit it with a Thunderbolt; the rest of the EVs are invested in Rotom-W's Special Attack to allow it to hit the things it checks for solid damage. Hidden Power Grass is a nice option to hit Gastrodon, which is otherwise a huge problem for this set. However, the loss of a support move can hamper Rotom-W's effectiveness. Thunder is a nice option in rain to grant Rotom-W more power, but its accuracy is shaky outside of rain, which can be a problem. Another option for this set is Discharge, as it gives Rotom-W a spread move with a nice paralysis chance. However, there is a noticeable drop in power between it and Thunderbolt, and the fact that it can also hit your partner can be a huge problem as it either forces Rotom-W's partner to Protect or forces you to pair Rotom-W with a Pokemon with an immunity to Electric-type attacks.</p> <p>Because Rotom-W is vulnerable to Grass- and Dragon-types that don't mind its attacks, Pokemon that can handle them such as Scizor and Abomasnow make for great partners. Scizor resists both Grass- and Dragon-type moves and can damage their users heavily with its Technician-boosted attacks. Abomasnow's STAB Blizzards can easily threaten both Grass- and Dragon-types, and it can also take care of Gastrodon with Giga Drain, making it another good choice. Other good partners include Hitmontop for its Intimidate support, Latios for its ability to outspeed other Dragon-types and beat Grass-types, and Tornadus for outspeeding all common Dragon-types and decimating things that can threaten Rotom-W with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus can also be effective partners, as they appreciate Rotom-W's ability to check rain as well as its paralysis support; they also don't have to worry about hitting Rotom-W with Earthquake thanks to its Levitate ability.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>With Choice Specs and maximum Special Attack investment, Rotom-W's Special Attack reaches a whopping 509, letting it dish out serious pain to just about anything it attacks. Hydro Pump is the main STAB attack here, and it is a great move to be locked into thanks to its great coverage and high power, which lets it heavily damage Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Scizor. Thunderbolt is the secondary STAB move and has nice coverage with Hydro Pump, eliminating pesky Water-types such as Jellicent and Suicune that don't mind a Hydro Pump. It also allows Rotom-W to be locked into a more reliable STAB move and not have to risk Hydro Pump's 80% accuracy. Thunder might seem like a strange option alongside Thunderbolt, but it serves an important purpose. Even if you are using Rotom-W outside of rain, Thunder is necessary to net important KOs against common rain Pokemon, making this set a much better rain check. Here are some damage calculations comparing the power of Thunder to that of Thunderbolt:</p> <ul> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunderbolt vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Ludicolo: 220-259 (73.57 - 86.62%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunder vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Ludicolo: 277-327 (92.64 - 109.36%) -- 56.25% chance to OHKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunderbolt vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Kingdra: 229-270 (78.69 - 92.78%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</li> <li>252+ SpA Choice Specs Rotom-W Thunder vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Kingdra: 288-340 (98.96 - 116.83%) -- 93.75% chance to OHKO</li> </ul> <p>If you are uncomfortable using Thunder outside of rain, Trick is another good option, as it lets you cripple a Pokemon by locking it into a move, severely hampering its usability. Trick is also useful because it prevents Pokemon from effectively taking advantage of moves such as Fake Out and Protect. Hidden Power Grass is mainly used to eliminate Gastrodon, which is very important because Gastrodon is immune to both of its STAB moves and not only redirects but also gets a boost from Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Ice is also an option to be able to eliminate Salamence and Shaymin-S. However, Thunder is able to OHKO both of them, so keep that in mind when deciding whether to use it.</p> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to fire off an attack while gaining momentum, but it is weaker than Thunderbolt and isn't able to be used as reliably due to forcing Rotom-W out when it is used. Another option for this set is Discharge, as it gives Rotom-W a spread move with a high chance to paralyze an opposing Pokemon. However, there is a noticable drop in power between it and Thunderbolt, and the fact that it can hit Rotom-W's partner can be a huge problem. This set really enjoys rain support, as not only does it grant Hydro Pump more power but it also allows Rotom-W to use Thunder reliably. The EVs allow Rotom-W to live a Life Orb-boosted Giga Drain from Ludicolo, which is even more important on this set because Rotom-W has a high chance to OHKO it in return with Thunder.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Scizor and Tornadus that can reliably eliminate Grass- and Dragon-types make good partners for this set as well. Garchomp, Excadrill, and Landorus appreciate this set's ability to easily wear down defensive Pokemon so they can clean up late-game. They also enjoy the fact that they can use their powerful Earthquakes without worrying about hurting Rotom-W. Cresselia also makes for a great partner as it can provide the speed control that Rotom-W likes having. It also enjoys the fact that this set can easily destroy things such as Scizor and Tyranitar that would otherwise threaten it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf set, Rotom-W can outspeed and beat faster threats such as Tornadus. Hydro Pump is one of the main STAB moves used, and it is a great attacking option due to its high Base Power and its impeccable coverage. It is also great because it can eliminate Ground-types which are looking to absorb a Thunderbolt or Volt Switch; it also hits Tyranitar, which otherwise would not be bothered by anything on this set. Thunderbolt is another great attacking option because it hits bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Politoed and is more reliable than Hydro Pump due to its perfect accuracy. Volt Switch is a great option for picking off weakened Pokemon while maintaining offensive momentum. It is also a great way to bring in Pokemon such as Politoed to give your team an edge in weather wars. Trick is a great option to cripple defensive Pokemon that might try to take advantage of the fact that Rotom-W will be locked into a move. The fact that it disrupts the use of moves such as Fake Out and Protect is also a nice bonus. Hidden Power Grass is the main option on this set to get rid of Gastrodon, which is very important because Rotom-W has no way to get past it otherwise. However, Hidden Power Ice is an option to KO Shaymin-S and Salamence.</p> <p>The EVs are very simple and are meant to make Rotom-W as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature is slashed first in order to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross, but if this benchmark isn't necessary for your team, a Modest nature can be used for more power, netting useful KOs such as an OHKO on Tyranitar outside of Sand. Thunder is an option over Thunderbolt, but it should only be used with rain support, as otherwise its accuracy will be too shaky. Sadly, due to the lack of investment in bulk, this set has more trouble switching into hits than others. This set works best on teams that are slower and need a way to take on fast attackers, so teams utilizing strategies such as Tailwind will likely be better served by another one.</p> <p>Politoed makes for a great partner for this set, giving Hydro Pump a large boost in power and enabling Rotom-W to use Thunder instead of Thunderbolt. In addition, Politoed appreciates Rotom-W's access to Volt Switch, as it allows Politoed to perform better in weather wars. Pokemon that can defeat the Grass- and Dragon-types that don't mind taking on this set, such as Scizor, Abomasnow, and Tornadus, make for good partners. Cresselia makes for another good partner to this set as it can provide Helping Hand support, allowing Rotom-W to gain KOs that it might otherwise miss out on, such as an OHKO on Shaymin-S with Thunder.</p>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Shaymin-S is infamous due to the combination of Serene Grace with Seed Flare and Air Slash. It can be difficult to reliably switch in to its attacks, as the opponent will be risking a potential Special Defense drop. Additionally, its high Speed combined with Serene Grace Air Slash makes it an annoyance, as it outspeeds much of the unboosted metagame and has a high chance of flinching foes. Although that might sound powerful, Shaymin-S has notable weaknesses that hold it back from being a top threat. It relies heavily on its Speed to be effective and thus is susceptible to speed control. Additionally, Grass and Flying aren't very useful offensive types, only hitting few Pokemon super effectively and notably leaving it walled by Thundurus, Metagross, and Heatran. This means that Shaymin-S oftentimes relies on RNG to make up for its underwhelming offensive output. While Grass is typically a solid defensive typing in the metagame, Shaymin-S lacks the bulk or utility required to make use of it and, as such, is difficult to fit on teams. Nonetheless, Serene Grace can allow Shaymin-S to still make an impact, making it a threat that teams should be wary of.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's strongest Grass-type STAB move, allowing it to OHKO bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Air Slash is a secondary STAB move that hits Amoonguss and Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr, super effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute blocks Thunder Wave and hits that would otherwise cause it to faint, mitigating two of Shaymin-S's biggest weaknesses. Earth Power is an option to hit Metagross and Heatran super effectively, which would otherwise wall Shaymin-S's attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grass Gem boosts the power of Seed Flare, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Jellicent and giving a 50% chance to OHKO Tyranitar in sand. Leftovers is an option when using Substitute to give Shaymin-S passive healing and mitigate the residual damage from sand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shaymin-S generally tries to set up Substitute as soon as possible. Shaymin-S behind a Substitute is a major threat, as a Seed Flare Special Defense drop or Air Slash flinch allows it to quickly control the field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shaymin-S finds itself on more offensive teams, as they can afford the utility loss of a bulky Grass-type. Shaymin-S fits well on rain teams, as it threatens bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Gastrodon, and Grass-types such as Amoonguss. The Special Defense drop from Seed Flare also benefits Kingdra greatly, improving its already high damage output. Shaymin-S also synergizes well with sand teams; its Air Slash threatens Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr, while its Ground immunity allows Excadrill to Earthquake freely next to Shaymin-S. In return, Excadrill threatens Thundurus, Heatran, and Metagross. Finally, Thundurus is an excellent teammate, as its paralysis support alongside the high flinch chance of Shaymin-S's Air Slash almost guarantees that the target won't move.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tailwind is a speed control option against foes that will likely use Protect, at the cost of better coverage. Lum Berry can be used to absorb Thunder Wave once, giving Shaymin-S more flexibility in the face of Thundurus. Life Orb can be used for increased damage.</p> </li> </ul>"

Additionally, Excadrill has an excellent typing that has an amazing matchup against some of the most common Pokemon, such as Thundurus, Tyranitar, and Metagross. Most notably, Excadrill hard-counters Thundurus, including a rare immunity to its Prankster Thunder Wave, which sets it apart from other fast attackers.</li> <li>Rock Slide is a secondary spread attack that can hit Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Thundurus, in addition to having decent odds of flinching opposing Pokemon. Substitute makes great use of Excadrill's typing, allowing it to set Substitute up easily against the likes of Thundurus. Substitute also blocks Intimidate, burns from Will-O-Wisp, and Amoonguss's Spore, which are common ways of slowing down Excadrill. Iron Head is a secondary STAB move that can be used to hit Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Latios or Landorus-T, harder. Finally, Swords Dance is a more aggressive option that makes use of Excadrill's excellent matchup into Thundurus, allowing Excadrill to snowball and take over the game.</li> <li>Life Orb is the preferred item, because it gives a consistent boost to all of Excadrill's attacks. Ground Gem is an option for a one-time power boost to Earthquake. The idea is that Rock Slide is typically only used on super-effective hits, so Excadrill can afford the drop in power. Leftovers is an option on those using Substitute, although this greatly weakens Excadrill's damage output.</li> <li>A Jolly nature can be used to ensure a Speed tie with opposing Excadrill but similarly will weaken Excadrill's damage output, notably missing the guaranteed OHKOs on Shuca Berry Heatran and Choice item Kyurem-B with Iron Head after sand damage.</li> <li>Unlike its other weather-reliant counterpart, Kingdra, Excadrill does not gain a power boost to its attacks; therefore, it mostly acts as a cleaner with its strong spread attacks once key threats, such as Landorus-T and Conkeldurr, have been removed or weakened.</li> <li>Tyranitar is a mandatory teammate to set sand. Because Tyranitar and Excadrill share common weaknesses, Pokemon that can cover Ground-, Fighting-, and Water-types make excellent teammates. Excadrill will use Earthquake most often so Ground-immune Pokemon are necessary. Finally, Intimidate can slow Excadrill down, so it will benefit from teammates that can threaten Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Hitmontop. Latios and Cresselia are two notable teammates, because they both threaten Landorus-T, the most common Intimidate user, Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, and are immune to Ground-type attacks. Thundurus is another excellent teammate that can hit Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed, super effectively. Amoonguss can redirect super effective hits and generate free turns with Spore, allowing Excadrill to more easily set up.</li> </ul>"

In addition, its low Speed makes it an excellent Trick Room attacker, while its decent bulk and priority move can allow it to function well outside of Trick Room too, making it great at trading against faster, non-Trick Room attackers.</li> <li>Hammer Arm is a strong STAB attack, with the Speed drop drawback oftentimes being a positive for Conkeldurr, allowing it to underspeed Amoonguss under Trick Room. Drain Punch can be used over Hammer Arm for increased longevity in exchange for raw power.</li> <li>Mach Punch allows Conkeldurr to finish off weakened foes. Ice Punch can hit common Fighting-resistant foes, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss.</li> <li>Detect is preferred over Protect in the rare chance the foe is using Imprison.</li> <li>A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is recommended, if using Hammer Arm, so that Conkeldurr can underspeed Amoonguss after using Hammer Arm. If using Drain Punch, an Adamant nature with 31 Speed IVs can be used, which allows Conkeldurr to outrun faster paralyzed threats such as Choice Scarf Genesect and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B.</li> <li>This spread maximizes Conkeldurr's Attack while allowing it to live Expert Belt Cresselia Psychic.</li> <li>Life Orb is the preferred item because it gives a consistent boost to all of Conkeldurr's attacks, notably allowing it to OHKO bulky Thundurus with Ice Punch.</li> <li>Conkeldurr benefits greatly from any type of speed control, although it can be more effective under Trick Room due to its low Speed. It is worth noting that, depending on the chosen STAB move, Conkeldurr can have a different role on the team. With Hammer Arm, Conkeldurr acts as a dedicated Trick Room attacker. With Drain Punch, it can focus more on whittling down the opposing team, exchanging raw damage output for better damage trading and health recovery.</li> <li>Cresselia and Jellicent are two common Trick Room setters that benefit from Conkeldurr's ability to beat Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Thundurus can provide speed control with its Prankster Thunder Wave while also threatening Jellicent. Tyranitar can threaten Psychic-types, such as Cresselia and Latios, and Jellicent.</li> <li>Thunder Punch is an option over Ice Punch to hit Jellicent; however, this would greatly reduce Conkeldurr's coverage, as it loses the ability to reliably damage Landorus-T and Amoonguss. Conkeldurr's low Speed in combination with common Fighting-resistant foes, such as Landorus-T, Thundurus, and Amoonguss, makes it easy to chip Conkeldurr if using Life Orb; therefore, Fighting Gem is an option to increase its longevity while maintaining a strong Fighting-type attack.</li> <li>Another option is a bulky set with a 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD EV spread, an Adamant nature, Drain Punch over Hammer Arm, and Sitrus Berry for the item. This set focuses on Conkeldurr's excellent coverage and passable bulk to force trades and can be more functional outside of Trick Room.</li> </ul>"

Scrafty's poor damage output, however, is a major downside, oftentimes missing KOs even on super effective hits. Added on to this is a susceptibility to Intimidate, meaning that Scrafty can find itself providing little utility after the initial Fake Out and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fake Out can generate pressure and opportunities for Scrafty's teammate, allowing it to set up Trick Room or Substitute more easily. Drain Punch is a reliable STAB attack with the added benefit of recovering some health. Low Kick more often has a higher Base Powder, allowing Scrafty to dish out more damage against heavier Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Heatran. Notably, Low Kick OHKOes non-Chople Berry Tyranitar. Crunch is Scrafty's strongest Dark-type STAB move, giving it a high chance to 2HKO Jellicent. Taunt can be used to give Scrafty additional utility, allowing it to shut down support Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Jellicent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is the preferred item to increase Scrafty's longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV spread allows Scrafty to tank Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor twice in a row while the remaining Attack investment allows it to still 2HKO key targets such as Tyranitar and Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty's utility comes from Intimidate and Fake Out, so it switches in and out often. Despite its low damage output, Scrafty's damage can still rack up if left unchecked, especially since it can be difficult to knock out thanks to Intimidate and its natural bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scrafty is common on Trick Room teams, as its unique skillset synergizes well with the needs of such teams. Cresselia and Jellicent are two common Trick Room setters that benefit from Intimidate and Scrafty threatening Latios and Tyranitar. Fake Out can also allow Cresselia and Jellicent to set up Trick Room easier. Latios is another excellent teammate, as it can benefit from Fake Out neutralizing a faster foe, such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, for a turn, allowing Latios to KO it. Additionally, Scrafty can threaten common Latios answers such as Tyranitar and Kyurem-B. It forms a solid Intimidate core with Landorus-T, neutralizing the opponent's physical attackers. Additionally, Landorus-T and Scrafty can control the pace of the battle, as Landorus-T pivots into a more favorable teammate, while Scrafty generates free turns with Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead of Detect or Taunt, Super Fang is an option to damage bulkier Pokemon such as Thundurus and Gastrodon. Ice Punch is another option that does solid damage to Landorus-T and Thundurus. Helping Hand boosts the power of Scrafty's partner, thereby slightly mitigating its own low damage output.</p> </li> </ul>"

Giga Drain is a weak STAB attack that does decent damage against Water-types.</li> <li>The given EV spread lives Metagross's Zen Headbutt while maximizing Special Defense so that Amoonguss can better tank common special moves, such as Life Orb Latios's Psychic or Kyurem-B's Ice Beam. A Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs minimizes Amoonguss's Speed so that it can function better as a Trick Room check. Most notably, it underspeeds Conkeldurr in Trick Room. Sitrus Berry can increase Amoonguss's longevity by allowing it to survive being attacked by both foes or 2HKOs it would not otherwise, thus allowing it to continue disrupting with Spore or redirection. Lum Berry is mainly for opposing Amoonguss, as it cures Amoonguss from sleep, whereas Mental Herb is mainly for Thundurus, preventing Amoonguss from being shut down by Taunt for one turn.</li> <li>Amoonguss can be extremely flexible with its spread and item depending on the needs of the team. For example, teams can opt for a more physically defensive set if necessary.</li> <li>Amoonguss aims to disrupt the opponent by putting key threats to sleep or supporting teammates with redirection. With its typing, Amoonguss can act as a pivot by switching into attacks and putting a threat to sleep. Against rain or Trick Room teams, it is best to preserve Amoonguss's health as much as possible, as it matches up well against them.</li> <li>Amoonguss is extremely flexible, so it can fit on many team compositions. Jellicent is an excellent teammate, forming a defensive core that is generally capable of answering anything in the metagame. Landorus-T is another great teammate due to Intimidate weakening opposing physical attackers, its ability to threaten Thundurus, Heatran, and Metagross, and access to U-turn, which allows it to pivot safely into Amoonguss. Finally, Amoonguss synergizes well with Heatran, as it can redirect Fighting- and Water-type attacks as well as allows Heatran to set up Substitute easier.</li> </ul>"

Generally, Will-O-Wisp provides more immediate support and utility, while Toxic helps Jellicent to function more as a wincon.</li> <li>Sitrus Berry is the preferred item, because it gives immediate healing, allowing Jellicent to avoid 2HKO's that it otherwise could not.</li> <li>Water Absorb makes Jellicent an even better check to rain teams. Cursed Body can be used on teams with sufficient rain answers and has a chance at disabling moves that hit Jellicent hard, such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt or Landorus-T's Earthquake. This allows Jellicent to stall it out when it couldn't otherwise.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Jellicent to survive Tyranitar's Crunch while maximizing Special Defense so that it can better tank common special moves such as Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor or Thundurus's Thunderbolt. Notably, this spread with Sitrus Berry gives Jellicent a 75% chance to be 3HKOed by bulky Thundurus's Thunderbolt.</li> <li>Since Jellicent is a defensive wincon, it can oftentimes win games by itself once its threats are removed. That said, Jellicent's excellent typing can allow it to switch in easily against common metagame threats. Additionally, access to recovery allows Jellicent to stay healthy and be used throughout the game, so it may be used early to spread status.</li> <li>Although Jellicent can fit easily on many teams, it appreciates teammates that can threaten Tyranitar, Thundurus, Grass-types, and Dragon-types. Landorus-T is an excellent teammate due to Intimidate support and its ability to threaten Tyranitar and Thundurus. Metagross and Genesect are able to threaten Tyranitar while also matching well into Grass-types and the two most common Dragon-types, Latios and Kyurem-B. Pokemon that can benefit from Trick Room also pair well with Jellicent. Conkeldurr is a notable one, as it can threaten Tyranitar, Kyurem-B, and Thundurus. Heatran, which can benefit from Trick Room, appreciates Jellicent's ability to threaten Landorus-T, Conkeldurr, opposing Heatran, and rain while it, in return, can check Amoonguss. Finally, Amoonguss has excellent synergy with Jellicent, forming a strong defensive core. For example, Jellicent can switch into Heatran, Cresselia, and Ice-type attacks that threaten Amoonguss, while Amoonguss covers Jellicent by switching into opposing Toxic and resists Electric-type attacks.</li> <li>Leftovers can be used for more passive healing. Mental Herb is an option for more dedicated Trick Room teams to avoid Taunt and guarantee a Trick Room.</li> </ul>"

Bisharp, however, is held back by its middling speed tier, and its Sucker Punch can be played around with redirection. Its low Special Defense also means that stray neutral special moves, such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt, will do massive damage. Finally, the three Intimidate users, Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Scrafty, all can hit Bisharp super effectively, mitigating its ability to snowball with Defiant. Night Slash is Bisharp's most reliable STAB move, OHKOing Jellicent with Dark Gem. Low Kick provides excellent coverage alongside Bisharp's Dark-type STAB attacks by covering Dark- and Steel-resistant Pokemon, such as Heatran and Tyranitar. Life Orb secures an OHKO on Heatran and Kyurem-B with Low Kick after Stealth Rock damage and allows Bisharp to fire off a strong Sucker Punch. Dark Gem grants a one-time boost to Sucker Punch, allowing Bisharp to do massive damage to a faster threat, such as OHKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1. It also allows Bisharp to OHKO Jellicent with Night Slash. Landorus-T is a good teammate because Bisharp benefits greatly from Stealth Rock support, which puts foes in KO range of Sucker Punch. Landorus-T can also check Heatran while benefiting from Bisharp's ability to check Jellicent and Latios. Physical attackers are also excellent teammates, because Bisharp deters Intimidate users from switching in. Choice Band Kyurem-B is another good teammate, as the threat of a Defiant boost can prevent Intimidate, allowing Kyurem-B to fire off strong a Outrage.

Rock Slide is an alternative that trades power for a consistent spread attack that can chip foes. Substitute blocks Intimidate drops and debilitating status such as Thunder Wave, while Taunt gives Terrakion utility against bulky support Pokemon that it cannot damage.</li> <li>Lum Berry improves Terrakion's matchup against Thundurus by keeping it safe from Thunder Wave once, allowing Terrakion to set up a Substitute or damage it with its Rock-type attacks. Fighting Gem increases Terrakion's already high damage output by giving it a one-time nuke option, guaranteeing the OHKO on Ferrothorn and a high chance to OHKO Kyurem-B after an Intimidate drop.</li> <li>Thundurus is an excellent teammate thanks to Thunder Wave slowing down threats that outspeed Terrakion, such as Latios and Kingdra. In return, Terrakion beats Kyurem-B and Tyranitar, two of Thundurus's biggest checks. Cresselia is another good teammate due to its access to speed control and ability to threaten Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Conkeldurr. Rain teams benefit from Terrakion's ability to threaten Kyurem-B, Thundurus, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn while Kingdra threatens Landorus-T. The duo of Kingdra and Terrakion also have strong STAB spread attacks that make it difficult for the foe to switch into.</li> </ul>"

Superpower hits Flying-resistant Pokemon super effectively, such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran.

Taunt further boosts Thundurus's utility, as it can shut down Amoonguss, prevent Substitute, and stop Trick Room from going up. On top of this, an impressive Special Attack stat alongside BoltBeam coverage gives Thundurus an offensive presence that most support Pokemon do not have. Notably, Thundurus is one of most teams' only options in consistently pressuring Jellicent.</li> <li>All of this combined solidifies Thundurus as one of the best Pokemon in the metagame and a threat that all teams must be prepared for.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Thundurus to survive Timid Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor and outspeed Adamant Landorus-T. Thundurus can run many other spreads depending on the needs of the team. For example, a spread of 252 HP / 60 Def / 176 SpD / 20 Spe and a Calm nature allow Thundurus to survive a Timid Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor while outrunning boosted base 70s.</li> <li>Thundurus has extremely high value, so it is recommended to preserve it as long as possible or until it has slowed down key threats with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave will always have utility at any stage of the game because a key full paralysis can oftentimes turn the tides of the battle.</li> <li>Thundurus can easily fit on many team archetypes and does not require much direct support to be effective; however, it does benefit greatly from teammates that can remove Kyurem-B and Tyranitar, two threats that can threaten an OHKO on Thundurus, such as Genesect and Conkeldurr.</li> <li>Thundurus has a plethora of other moves it can use. Hidden Power Flying is an option for better damage to Amoonguss. Substitute can block a strong incoming attack, such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Additionally, Substitute guarantees that Thundurus can take one hit, allowing it to more effectively spread paralysis. Protect can be used to increase Thundurus's longevity, as opponents oftentimes prioritize removing Thundurus. Finally, Sky Drop is an interesting option to remove a threat for one turn and is often used in combination with a setup Pokemon, such as Suicune.</li> <li>A set with a 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread, a Timid nature, and an Electric Gem can be used on teams that favor more offensive presence while still having the utility of Thunder Wave.</li> <li>A physical Thundurus with Defiant, a 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe spread, a Jolly nature, Life Orb, and a moveset of Wild Charge, Superpower, Crunch, and Protect is a solid anti-metagame option, as it can outspeed and threaten common Pokemon such as Latios, Tyranitar, and Jellicent.</li> </ul>"

This, in combination with its high Special Attack and decent Speed tier, allows it to be an offensive threat that is capable of checking the most common Pokemon in the metagame such as the aforementioned Thundurus and Jellicent. Thundurus-T, however, lacks the overall utility of its Incarnate forme, making it a harder fit for most teams. As a result, Thundurus-T is typically only used on more offensive teams, such as rain, where the utility of being a Thunder Wave absorber can be more beneficial than the use of Thunder Wave itself.</li> <li>If Thundurus-T is being used on a rain team, Thunder is recommended; otherwise, Thunderbolt should be used. Hidden Power Flying is typically recommended, as it hits Amoonguss super effectively. Hidden Power Ice is an option for teams that want to hit Landorus-T instead and is more suited for non-rain teams, as those already have multiple ways of hitting Landorus-T super effectively.</li> <li>Electric Gem is the preferred item, as it notably allows Thundurus-T to OHKO Jellicent with Thunder. Flying Gem can be used on rain teams for more damage against Amoonguss.</li> <li>Thundurus-T's main role is to use Thunder whenever possible and Volt Switch out against unfavorable matchups. If the opponent has a Thundurus, it is best to preserve Thundurus-T so that it can check Thundurus when needed.</li> <li>Politoed and Kingdra are excellent teammates, as they can threaten Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill. Thundurus-T, in turn, matches well into common rain answers such as Amoonguss, Jellicent, and Thundurus. Genesect is another teammate that benefits from Thundurus-T's ability to check Jellicent and Thundurus, while it can check Tyranitar and Kyurem-B for Thundurus-T. The two also form a formidable VoltTurn core, capable of pivoting between each other for better positioning.</li> <li>Other options include Choice Scarf, which turns Thundurus-T into a speedy, powerful pivot, and Choice Specs, which turns it into a strong wallbreaker. A Substitute set with Leftovers is another interesting option, taking advantage of its excellent matchup into common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Amoonguss, Jellicent, and Thundurus, setting up Substitute and spreading massive damage against the foe with its strong Electric-type attacks.</li> </ul>"

Fusion Bolt can hit bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed, super effectively without relying on Outrage. Sleep Talk bypasses the effects of Spore, allowing Kyurem-B to attack even while asleep.

Genesect can run an Occa Berry, but it still won't be able to survive most powerful Fire-type attacks used in the tier. Bug Gem is also an option for allowing Genesect to do major damage to Cresselia and Tyranitar without restricting its move selection, but Choice Band is generally the better item choice if you want extra power. Rock Polish is available, but Genesect doesn't quite have the bulk to pull it off in Doubles. Sitrus Berry is nice for longevity, but it is generally worse than more offensive items such as Expert Belt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fire-type Pokemon, such as Heatran, Volcarona, Chandelure, and Ninetales, do not fear Genesect at all and can easily exploit its 4x weakness to Fire-type moves without taking much damage from its attacks. Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in rain are also big threats, as their powerful moves will deal a lot of damage to Genesect. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp also threaten Genesect with powerful spread moves such as Earthquake, though it is worth noting that Choice Scarf Genesect can beat Landorus-T with Ice Beam.

It also hits common Pokemon such as Tyranitar in sandstorm for more damage than Bug Buzz, which is still a viable alternative if you want a special STAB that is unaffected by Intimidate. Thunder is the better choice for rain teams and can OHKO 252/0 Politoed, provided Genesect has a Special Attack boost from Download; however, it is risky if rain is not up. Ice Beam deals with Dragons-types and other Pokemon 4x weak to it, such as Landorus-T, allowing Genesect to outspeed and KO them. Protect is standard for prediction and can keep Genesect safe while its counters are removed. Flamethrower is an option over Protect to increase Genesect's coverage but means Genesect is even more threatened by its checks and counters, and will be forced to switch out more often.</p> <p>With a favorable Download boost, Genesect can easily defeat a lot of Pokemon with not-so-stellar defenses; however, anything with decent bulk can force it out. Genesect also hates Trick Room, as it works against Genesect's Speed. Pokemon with moves such as Taunt to stop the enemy from using Trick Room can be good partners. This set really benefits from Tailwind support as it helps Genesect take on faster opponents and also lets it U-turn out into a Tailwind setter to keep momentum. Genesect partners well with Chandelure and Heatran, as they make opponents think twice about using Fire-type attacks. Genesect takes no damage from sandstorm, meaning it is easy to fit onto a sandstorm team. Giga Drain can be used to take down Gastrodon if it is an issue. Blizzard is viable, especially in hail, as it really packs a punch and can deal major damage. A Focus Sash can secure a few surprise KOs, but Expert Belt and Life Orb are generally better. Expert Belt is the preferred choice for most teams as it helps Genesect get a number of significant KOs with no drawbacks.

Flamethrower provides more coverage but is worse on rain teams, on the one hand while Bug Buzz gives Genesect a special STAB move in case you don't want it to switch out. Explosion is great late-game, and can help deal with things your team might struggle with. Genesect must always be wary of getting predicted and locked into a bad move, as it doesn't have much bulk to rely on. Make sure you scout out the enemy's Choice Scarf users before being too reckless with Genesect due to this frailty.

Giga Drain can be used in the last slot if your team has trouble dealing with the commonly seen Gastrodon. Genesect benefits greatly from a Pokemon that resists Fire-type attacks, such as Tyranitar; Genesect's immunity to sandstorm makes Tyranitar an even better partner.
