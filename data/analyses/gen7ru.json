  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Gardevoir's high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing of Psychic / Fairy make it a hard Pokemon to switch into, especially for teams that use less sturdy Fairy checks such as Forretress and Steelix as their sole Steel-type. In addition to its main attacking moves, Gardevoir gets access to useful support moves, mainly Healing Wish. Moreover, Trace is a great ability on Gardevoir, as it can copy useful abilities such as Levitate from Flygon, and Regenerator from Slowbro. However, it has pitiful Defense, which makes it revenge killed quite easily and 2HKOed by most neutral hits. Although it outspeeds most bulkier Pokemon, there are faster Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Flygon, and its unboosted Speed stat makes it slower than most offensive Pokemon. Setup sweepers such as Barbaracle and Dragon Dance Zygarde-10% are also faster than Choice Scarf Gardevoir after boosting, making it imperfect at revenge killing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Destiny Bond can be used on the Choice Scarf set, but it is less reliable, as it may not be used consecutively. Hidden Power Fire can be used on the Choice Scarf set to hit Escavalier very hard, but is not worth using over Will-O-Wisp or Trick in most situations. Ghostium Z can be used with dual STAB moves + Calm Mind to KO Bronzong, but this set gets walled by Registeel, fails to outspeed common threats, and lacks power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong, Registeel, and Escavalier take little damage from Gardevoir's STAB moves and weaken it or KO back. However, Bronzong needs to be wary of Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Ball, while Registeel has to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast. Escavalier tanks everything apart from Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Florges, Porygon2, Cresselia, and Snorlax can tank Gardevoir's attacks and either inflict status ailments or damage it. They have to watch out for Trick, however. In Snorlax's case, it has to watch out for Psyshock as well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Salazzle, Sneasel, Mega Glalie, Roserade, and Ninetales threaten Choice Specs Gardevoir by attempting to outspeed and OHKO it due to its poor bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Sucker Punch from Honchkrow hits Gardevoir very hard due to its poor physical bulk. Toxicroak at +2 Attack is also very dangerous to Gardevoir, as it can straight up OHKO Choice Specs variants while threatening to OHKO Choice Scarf variants with Sucker Punch. Bullet Punch Machamp and First Impression Golisopod threaten major damage to any Gardevoir.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is Gardevoir's main STAB move, allowing it to hit threats such as Salazzle, Dragalge, and Venusaur. Moonblast is Gardevoir's secondary STAB move, which is a much safer move to spam and hits threats such as Flygon. Will-O-Wisp cripples offensive Steel-types like Metagross and Escavalier, which are often an opponent's only solid Gardevoir switch-ins, while Trick hinders bulkier Pokemon like Registeel and Curse Snorlax. Healing Wish is used to heal a worn-down teammate in order for them to threaten the opponent's team again. Memento can aid a setup sweeper such as Bararacle, or Dragon Dance Zygarde-10% by lowering the opponent's Attack and Special Attack. Focus Blast is an option to hit Steel-types like Registeel, but it does not hit very hard unboosted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are used to ensure Gardevoir hits as hard as it can and outspeeds notable threats in the tier, such as Aerodactyl and Noivern as well as Speed tying with other Gardevoir. Trace lets Gardevoir copy useful abilities, such as Regenerator, Sheer Force, Adaptability, and Levitate. It can also copy Chlorophyll and Sand Rush, which turns the tables versus weather teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gardevoir should be used as a cleaner most of the time after the opponent's team has been worn down. If the opponent's team is too bulky, Trick can be used to cripple a threat. However, refrain from using Trick if the opponent's setup sweepers have not been taken care of. Playing recklessly with allied wallbreakers such as Dragalge is fine, as Gardevoir can use Healing Wish to bring one of them back to full health late-game. Therefore, refraining from using Healing Wish until then is a good idea. Lastly, keep in mind that bluffing a Choice Specs set will cause foes to switch out to Steel-types often.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Escavalier and Choice Specs Dragalge appreciate Gardevoir as a cleaner and a Healing Wish user; Choice Band Escavalier is frequently used to trap Pokemon like Bronzong and opposing Gardevoir, and Choice Specs Dragalge is commonly used as a switch-in to threats like Virizion. Salazzle has good synergy with Choice Scarf Gardevoir, as it can power through walls with a +2 Acid Downpour, leaving Gardevoir to clean. Salazzle can also take advantage of Pokemon that tend to switch into Gardevoir, such as Florges and Escavalier. Finally, the aforementoned Choice Band Escavalier with Pursuit is also a good partner, as it can weaken Bronzong and Metagross, two of the best checks to Gardevoir.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is Gardevoir's primary STAB move, which allows it to get past specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges. Moonblast hits Dark-types and is a more spammable STAB move, as no Pokemon are immune to it and it is much stronger. Shadow Ball is an option to hit Bronzong and Metagross, which otherwise take all of Gardevoir's hits relatively easily. Hidden Power Fire allows Gardevoir to lure and KO Escavalier, which is one of its best answers. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to hit Registeel hard, as it resists both of Gardevoir's STAB moves. Trick cripples bulkier Pokemon. Healing Wish is an option to allow a weakened teammate to sweep after Gardevoir has weakened the opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment ensures that Gardevoir outspeeds bulky Pokemon and hits as hard as possible. A Timid nature is preferred for this set, as it allows Gardevoir to outspeed Pokemon like Vanilluxe, Mega Blastoise, and Necrozma. A Modest nature can be used for more power at the cost of outspeeding these Pokemon. Trace lets Gardevoir copy useful abilities such as Regenerator, Water Absorb, Sheer Force, Adaptability, and Levitate. It can also copy Chlorophyll and Sand Rush, which turns the tables versus weather teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gardevoir should be used as a wallbreaker and should never switch into attacks from an offensive Pokemon. Most bulky Pokemon will attempt to switch out and play around Gardevoir, so try to predict the opponent and use the move that deals with their switch-in. Try to have entry hazards up before wallbreaking with Gardevoir. Trick can completely dismantle setup sweepers, but watch out for Z-Crystals, as it will fail if the foe is holding one; notable examples of Z-Crystal users are Cresselia on stall teams and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf users such as Flygon capitalize on Gardevoir's ability to break bulky Pokemon. They can also take care of the Steel-types that check Gardevoir, especially Registeel and Metagross. Fire-types such as Arcanine, Ninetales, and Salazzle have nice synergy with Gardevoir, as they can help it take down Steel-types, while Gardevoir can break the bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon for them. Pokemon that can switch into Steel-types, in general, are good partners; Metagross is an example that can also provide offensive pressure, while Refresh Milotic can provide support by inflicting status ailments. Toxic Spikes and Spikes setters like Dragalge and Roserade have nice synergy with Gardevoir, as it can have an easier time wallbreaking with those entry hazards wearing the opposing team down. Setup sweepers such as Zygarde-10% appreciate Gardevoir's ability to wallbreak so they have an easier time cleaning the opposing team.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon is a solid pivot in RU thanks to its good Speed tier, good offensive typing, and access to U-turn. It can primarily act as a revenge killer with Choice Scarf, pressuring threats such as Raikou, Salazzle, and Mega Sceptile with its good STAB combination and decent offenses. Flygon is a versatile Pokemon, as its moveset is highly customizable to accommodate for certain threats and uses. For example, it could run Defog to clear entry hazards for its team, Aerial Ace to revenge kill Virizion, or Iron Tail to deal super effective damage to Fairy-types. However, Flygon is often overshadowed by Zygarde-10%, which has a better Speed tier and access to Extreme Speed and Thousand Arrows to combat revenge killers and beat Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate. Flygon does have better bulk, Levitate, and U-turn to make it a better Choice Scarf user, however. It also has competition as a Dragon-type Choice Scarf user from Goodra, which can threaten Pokemon that Flygon cannot and is forced out by fewer Pokemon. Flygon's defenses are far from stellar, limiting its defensive potential. Its Attack is also decent, but many times it is forced to use U-turn against bulkier teams. Flygon's Dragon / Ground typing allows it to safely come in against most Fire-types like Salazzle and Electric-types like Raikou, but it means that Flygon needs to be cautious of common Ice-type coverage moves from Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Raikou as well as Ice-types like Mega Glalie and Mega Abomasnow.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set using Substitute and Dragon Dance can turn Flygon into a threatening setup sweeper that fits on bulkier offensive teams thanks to Flygon's decent bulk and Levitate. However, this set is outclassed by Zygarde-10%. Iron Tail can also be considered so Flygon can hit Fairy-types for super effective damage. However, Iron Tail's low accuracy makes the move unreliable when it needs to take out these Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Outside of the rare Fire Punch, Bronzong has very little to fear from Flygon, as it resists its Dragon-type STAB moves and avoids Earthquake thanks to Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pokemon like Gardevoir, Florges, and Diancie can force Flygon out of the battle if they are healthy enough and take advantage of Flygon if it locks itself into Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Flygon's average offensive presence means that it struggles with breaking Pokemon such as Cresselia and Porygon2, as they can take any attack from Flygon and retaliate with either Toxic, Moonblast, or Ice Beam. Others like Mega Blastoise, Slowbro, and Milotic can take any attack that Flygon uses and threaten it out with Ice Beam, Toxic, or even a burn from Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage and Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Mega Glalie and Mega Abomasnow can threaten Flygon out of battle thanks to their powerful Ice-type moves. Flygon also needs to be careful of potential Ice-type coverage moves from Pokemon like Raikou, Salazzle, Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, and Donphan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is Flygon's best move on this set, as it not only separates Flygon from its competition but allows it to gain and maintain offensive momentum throughout the match by escaping bad matchups such as against Slowbro, Mega Blastoise, and Milotic. Earthquake is a strong STAB move with very few drawbacks. Outrage is Flygon's strongest Dragon-type STAB option and is generally a safe move to use late-game once Fairy-types are taken care of. Aerial Ace is used to revenge kill Virizion and other weakened Grass-types like Shaymin and Mega Sceptile. Dragon Claw is Flygon's safest Dragon-type STAB move to use, since it can revenge kill weakened foes such as Mega Sceptile, Virizion, and Noivern and makes Flygon less exploitable by Fairy-types. Defog can clear entry hazards for Flygon's team but should only be used in emergency situations. Fire Punch is also a good choice to revenge kill Bronzong, Escavalier, and weakened Shuca Berry Metagross as well as Grass-types like Virizion, Roserade, and Tsareena. However, its damage output is lackluster, and Flygon misses out on revenge killing Mega Sceptile reliably.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with Speed investment and a Choice Scarf ensures that Flygon will outspeed other Choice Scarf users such as Roserade, Houndoom, and Drapion as well as Speed tie with Choice Scarf Shaymin. An Adamant nature can be used instead to give Flygon more power while still being able to outspeed Choice Scarf Passimian. Levitate gives Flygon an immunity to Ground-type moves outside of Thousand Arrows, making it a decent switch-in to Pokemon like Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, and Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Flygon is a good pivot thanks to its access to U-turn and speed, allowing it to escape bad matchups and bring in an offensive answer to the foe, meaning Flygon gains and keeps offensive momentum for its team. Choice Scarf can also turn Flygon into a decent revenge killer if the foe is weak enough or even a late-game cleaner if its checks and counters are gone thanks to its great STAB combination and moves. However, Flygon's main goal is to pivot because this set has only average attacking power, so use U-turn as often as possible to bring other teammates in. Flygon should use its resistances to switch into Pokemon like Ninetales, Raikou, and Rhyperior. This play can be risky, though, since Pokemon like Raikou and Rhyperior can carry Ice-type coverage moves, which can result in losing Flygon. Defog should only be used if clearing Stealth Rock and Spikes is absolutely necessary. Flygon can safely use this move, since it does force switches with its STAB moves, but using this move when the opponent doesn't fall for it can result in Flygon being KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flygon fits on teams that need speed control, a soft check to Electric-, Fire-, and Ground-types, and a pivot to safely bring in offensive teammates. Pokemon such as Salazzle, Barbaracle, Toxicroak, and Virizion are good examples of teammates that appreciate being brought safely into battle with U-turn. Salazzle can also put pressure on Fairy-types and Bronzong for Flygon, while Virizion provides a safety net against Knock Off and Trick users. Other Pokemon such as Choice item Raikou, Forretress, and Mega Ampharos can form a pivoting core with Flygon; Raikou can also help beat the bulky Water-types that Flygon has trouble breaking. Steel-types such as Metagross, Escavalier, and Registeel can help Flygon by switching into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks for it. In return, Flygon can threaten Fire-types like Arcanine and Ninetales for these partners. Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Mega Sceptile also make decent teammates, since they beat defensive Water-type Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Slowbro, and Milotic for Flygon, while Flygon can check Pokemon like Salazzle for them in return. Entry hazard setters such as Metagross, Roserade, and Golisopod can provide further offensive pressure when Flygon needs to revenge kill a foe. Golisopod, in particular, appreciates Flygon's U-turn support safely bringing it in and can help mitigate Flygon's lackluster offensive output. Since Flygon does not have a reliable form of recovery, a cleric like Florges and Diancie can be considered to help keep it healthy so it can continue pivoting. These Pokemon also appreciate Flygon's ability to pressure Steel-types like Metagross for them. If Flygon is locked into Defog, it can be easily pressured out, so running another entry hazard remover such as Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Sigilyph would be recommended.</p>"

  "Noivern": {
    "overview": "<p>Noivern's fantastic Speed tier, access to Taunt and Roost, and decent bulk allow it to act as an effective revenge killer and stallbreaker. Noivern's Speed in particular allows it to outpace the majority of unboosted Pokemon in RarelyUsed, including threats like Virizion and Salazzle. The defensive perks of Noivern's Dragon / Flying typing, notably resistances to Fighting-, Fire-, Bug-, and Grass-type moves, let it act as a workable switch-in to common offensive Pokemon, such as Virizion, Arcanine, Golisopod, and Roserade, and force prediction from stronger wallbreakers like Flame Orb Machamp. Noivern has a fully customizable fourth moveslot with options such as Super Fang, U-turn, Flamethrower, and Draco Meteor, which allows it to improve bad matchups. For example, if a wallbreaking teammate such as Choice Band Pangoro needs opportunities to break defensive cores, Noivern can opt for U-turn to give it free turns. Choice Scarf Noivern is one of the best revenge killers in the tier, able to handle extremely quick setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Barbaracle and Rock Polish Tyrantrum while still providing utility in U-turn and Switcheroo. However, Noivern's bulk, while great for an offensive Pokemon, only allows it to barely avoid KOs from attacks like Virizion's Stone Edge, so any residual damage from sources such as Toxic and Stealth Rock severely cuts into its ability to switch into threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb makes Noivern's Draco Meteor much more potent. For example, Raikou can't switch into it, and Barbaracle is KOed after slight chip damage. Flyinium Z improves Noivern's viability as a revenge killer and gives it a stronger offensive presence, notably allowing it to OHKO Salazzle and remove Mega Blastoise after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage. More offensive sets using items like Life Orb and Choice Specs can immediately pressure bulky offense teams using less sturdy Flying-resistant Pokemon like Metagross. Protect can be used to scout against Choice-locked attackers such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir. A spread of 184 HP / 116 SpD / 208 Spe can be used on Taunt + Roost Noivern to always take Hidden Power Ice from Choice Specs Ninetales and Life Orb Shaymin while still outpacing Salazzle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Porygon2, Diancie, and Ice Beam Milotic have no issue switching into Noivern multiple times and removing it with their super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Toxic is the most dangerous form of residual damage for Noivern, as it severely cuts into Noivern's stallbreaking potential. Stealth Rock and other status such as paralysis are very difficult to deal with as well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon like Ribombee, Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir outpace and OHKO Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Florges and Diancie switch into Noivern pretty easily and OHKO it with STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Defensive Rock-types like Rhyperior and Gigalith can switch into any of Noivern's attacks and OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves or use it to set up Stealth Rock. Offensive Rock-types, notably Lycanroc-D, can use it to set up or just OHKO it with Stone Edge.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt allows Noivern to deal with defensive Pokemon like Mantine and prevent Pokemon like Shell Smash Barbaracle from setting up. Roost is important to keep Noivern healthy so it can beat defensive threats and pivot into offensive threats like Shaymin and Choice Specs Ninetales throughout the game. U-turn lets Noivern pivot out of walls that it struggles with such as Gyro Ball Bronzong and bring in a threatening wallbreaker to deal with them. Super Fang deals great initial damage to Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-type switch-ins like Metagross, Assault Vest Raikou, and Tyrantrum. Draco Meteor allows Noivern to nail offensive Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Tyrantrum and Mega Ampharos on the switch. Flamethrower allows Noivern to deal with more offensive Steel-types that would otherwise check it such as Metagross. When used with Rocky Helmet, it also lets it always beat defensive Steel-types such as Registeel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Infiltrator gives Noivern a way to handle Pokemon like SubSeed Shaymin more easily and improve its matchup against dual screens teams. One can run a spread with heavy HP investment, but it'll severely cut into Noivern's ability to revenge kill and remove threats. For example, Noivern can't revenge kill Salazzle with Stealth Rock up or even beat Pokemon like Flame Orb Machamp and Roserade one-on-one without Special Attack investment. Rocky Helmet on Flamethrower sets improves Noivern's mediocre matchup against Steel-types like Registeel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't switch directly into Toxic users like Registeel, as being inflicted with status heavily compromises Noivern's ability to stallbreak. Make use of Noivern's excellent Speed tier and plethora of resistances by revenge killing setup Pokemon like Virizion and checking Pokemon like Golisopod. Make use of U-turn to bring in wallbreakers such as Flame Orb Machamp and Taunt + Roost to stop walls such as Bronzong from making any headway.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow, powerful wallbreakers such as Flame Orb Machamp and Choice Band Metagross appreciate free turns given by Noivern's U-turn. Pursuit users like Drapion and Metagross can come in through U-turn and remove Noivern checks such as Bronzong. Defensive Pokemon like Registeel act as switch-ins to faster threats such as Ribombee and Choice Scarf Gardevoir for Noivern. There are also offensive teammates that turn some of Noivern's revenge killers into liabilities. For example, Barbaracle can set up on revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Tyrantrum and become a massive threat late-game. Entry hazard removal in the form of teammates such as Mega Blastoise and Mantine is important, as Stealth Rock wears Noivern down very quickly.</p>"

Use U-turn to generate momentum by pivoting out of switch-ins like Bronzong. Be cautious when using Draco Meteor; the Special Attack drop could cost you greatly, as it gives setup sweepers such as Ninetales free turns.

  "Vikavolt": {
    "overview": "<p>With its unique resistances to Fighting, Grass, and Steel to deal with Pokemon such as Machamp, Virizion, and Metagross, Vikavolt appears as a promising bulky pivot in RU. Vikavolt is one of the slowest Volt Switch users in the tier, allowing it to safely bring in a teammate. It also has access to Levitate, which makes it immune to Spikes as well as Ground-type attacks barring Thousand Arrows, such as Flygon's Earthquake and Nidoqueen's Earth Power. Vikavolt can even keep itself healthy with Roost. Despite those great traits, Noivern, Forretress, and Tsareena give Vikavolt an immense amount of competition for the same role; Noivern is much faster and has better offensive presence, Forretress can also set up Spikes for its team and is much bulkier, and Tsareena resists Thousand Arrows and is immune to priority moves thanks to Queenly Majesty. Additionally, Vikavolt has a Stealth Rock weakness, which limits the amount of times it can pivot. It is also vulnerable to Toxic damage, which detriments its decent bulk and puts it on a timer, and threatened out by faster Rock- and Fire-type Pokemon like Tyrantrum, Salazzle, and Arcanine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground could also deal super effective damage to Nidoqueen and Salazzle on the switch, but it is generally inferior to its other moves because the other moves are more applicable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because of its Bug typing, Vikavolt loses a quarter of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock. Vikavolt also needs to be wary of Toxic, as the status condition puts it on a timer and limits the amount of time it can pivot.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Many Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Goodra, and Lycanroc-D can threaten Vikavolt out of battle thanks to its low Speed. None of these Pokemon want to come directly into one of its moves, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon like Ninetales, Salazzle, and Arcanine can take out Vikavolt with their STAB moves and comfortably stomach Bug Buzz, but they would not want to switch into Volt Switch.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Vikavolt to pivot in and out of battle as well as bring in a teammate safely thanks to its low Speed. Bug Buzz allows Vikavolt to threaten out Grass-types like Shaymin, Virizion, and Tsareena, which resist Volt Switch. Roost heals Vikavolt from prior damage and grants it more time to pivot. Energy Ball hits Ground-type switch-ins such as Rhyperior, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>60 EVs in Speed allow Vikavolt to outpace Registeel and uninvested Donphan. The rest of the EVs should be used to capitalize on Vikavolt's bulk. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item to punish physically offensive Pokemon like Machamp, Virizion, and Metagross for using contact moves, which Vikavolt can take easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vikavolt should use its resistances to Fighting, Grass, and Steel to safely come in against Pokemon like Machamp, Shaymin, and Metagross, which are usually threatened out thanks to its raw power putting a sizable dent into anything that doesn't resist its moves. It can also come in against Pokemon that are generally no threat to it such as Roserade, Passimian, and Virizion lacking Stone Edge. Because Vikavolt usually forces switches, it can be a good idea to use Roost to keep itself healthy. Volt Switch should be the move used the most so Vikavolt can pivot in and out of battle. Should a Ground-type switch-in like Rhyperior be anticipated, it is generally safe to use Energy Ball to heavily dent or OHKO it. While it is generally an offensive support Pokemon, Vikavolt can attempt to wallbreak early- to mid-game through punching holes in defensive Pokemon like Rhyperior, Metagross, and Slowbro for its teammates. Do not let Vikavolt get worn down too much; try to remove Stealth Rock so Vikavolt can pivot much more throughout the match, and avoid Toxic if you can, since being poisoned also chips away Vikavolt's decent bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vikavolt can be used alongside other Volt Switch or U-turn users such as Raikou, Ribombee, and Mandibuzz. Teammates that can get rid of entry hazards such as Mega Blastoise, Florges, and Donphan are much appreciated by Vikavolt so it can pivot more often. Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Arcanine, Rhyperior, and Diancie also make good partners for Vikavolt. In return, Vikavolt can threaten out the Water- and Grass-types that plague them. Pokemon that can threaten Rock-types such as Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Virizion are also good teammates for Vikavolt. Offensive Pokemon like Gardevoir, Shaymin, Swellow, and Goodra appreciate Vikavolt's ability to weaken Steel-types like Metagross so they can spam their powerful STAB moves more often. They also appreciate the slow Volt Switch Vikavolt provides so they can come into battle safely. Wallbreakers like Machamp, Tyrantrum, and Bewear also appreciate Vikavolt's slow Volt Switch. A cleric or Healing Wish user like Florges, Diancie, or Gardevoir can help heal Vikavolt in case it has been badly poisoned or worn down heavily by Stealth Rock and weak attacks. Diancie can also set Stealth Rock and appreciates Vikavolt's ability to switch into Steel-, Water-, and Ground-types.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia's incredible 120 / 120 / 130 bulk, ability in Levitate, and access to reliable recovery turn it into one of the most threatening defensive Pokemon in the tier, capable of checking devastating Pokemon like Salazzle, Dragalge, and Virizion. A reasonably good base Speed stat of 85 lets Cresselia outpace and OHKO Pokemon like Pangoro with a bit of Speed investment. Its amazing support movepool with options like Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to support its teammates well. However, Cresselia is commonly labelled as a \"do-nothing\" Pokemon, and for good reason. Its lackluster Special Attack and lack of any way to beat opposing walls other than Toxic will leave it helpless against other balance staples like Registeel and stallbreaker Mandibuzz. Cresselia's mediocre defensive typing means that it'll only be resisting a couple of attacking types while losing to a plethora of Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-types. Moonlight's limited PP will quickly leave Cresselia struggling to switch into attackers like Dragalge. Cresselia also has a massive vulnerability to status, notably Toxic poison and paralysis. For example, if Cresselia has been inflicted with Toxic poison, it'll struggle to consistently switch into Pokemon like Shaymin, Salazzle, and Roserade. In the same way, once Cresselia is paralyzed, it will no longer be able to outpace and check Pokemon like Bewear and Pangoro.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Colbur Berry lets Cresselia avoid the threatening predictions that Pursuit trappers like Choice-locked Drapion impose. For example, Cresselia can simply heal on Drapion as it attacks and make the most optimal play from there. Hidden Power Fire lets Cresselia beat nuisances such as Escavalier and Mega Abomasnow. Thunder Wave cripples Choice Scarf users like Tyrantrum and Gardevoir, letting teammates like Virizion and Salazzle more easily sweep. Lunar Dance lets you play more aggressively with Cresselia and wreak more havoc with your sweepers early-game, as it can revive them later on with Lunar Dance. Dumping the Defense EVs into Special Defense and running a Calm nature lets Cresselia more easily check specially offensive threats like Shaymin and Dragalge. Cresselia can run Fairium Z on stall teams to allow it to OHKO threats like Swords Dance Bewear and Honchkrow. It also improves Cresselia's matchup against Pursuit trappers like Drapion, as the Z-Crystal lowers Knock Off's damage output. Cresselia can run a bulky sweeper set with Calm Mind / Substitute / Moonblast / Moonlight or Psyshock. It should run enough Speed investment for outspeeding Taunt + Toxic Mandibuzz but can also use more investment to outspeed Timid Mega Blastoise, depending on what the team needs. This set should run a Timid nature, and the rest of the EVs should go into HP and Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types like Yanmega run right through Cresselia, beating it with their super effective STAB moves. Escavalier can switch into Cresselia with impunity, threaten to OHKO it with Megahorn, and Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers like Snorlax use Cresselia's low offensive stats to freely set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Registeel, Bronzong, and Escavalier are all not affected by Toxic and take very little damage from Cresselia's attacks. They stall Cresselia out with Toxic, or, in Escavalier's case, use it as setup fodder or outright OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Drapion beat Cresselia with their super effective STAB moves. Drapion and other Dark-types like Sneasel can also threaten Cresselia with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status, especially Toxic poison and paralysis, heavily cripples Cresselia. The former forces it to heal constantly so it doesn't get too worn down, and the latter prevents it from checking Pokemon like Bewear and Pangoro.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Nidoqueen shuts down Cresselia, as it can't heal and is forced to switch out or rely on its lackluster Special Attack to get it out of a sticky situation.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonlight is Cresselia's form of reliable recovery, healing half of its HP in a single turn. Cresselia's main STAB move is Psyshock and is used used over Psychic because it reliably 2HKOes Virizion. Moonblast lets Cresselia hit Dark- and Dragon-types like Pangoro and Zygarde-10%. Ice Beam is an option to deal with threats such as Noivern, Zygarde-10%, and Flygon much better, although it does leave it more vulnerable to Dark-types. Toxic lets Cresselia cripple switch-ins like Porygon2 that would otherwise wall it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>144 Speed EVs let Cresselia outpace Pokemon like Pangoro and Honchkrow so it can OHKO them with Moonblast without having to worry about taking a powerful hit. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to maximize Cresselia's potential to soak up physical attacks. A Bold nature improves Cresselia's already respectable Defense stat. Leftovers gives Cresselia passive recovery and lets it more easily switch into attackers like Gardevoir and Nidoqueen. Levitate allows Cresselia to consistently switch into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Nidoqueen.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid Toxic from Pokemon like Registeel and Zygarde-10% at all costs, as once Cresselia gets badly poisoned, it will struggle to switch into a plethora of Pokemon. In the same way, avoid paralysis, as Cresselia will struggle to check Pokemon like Pangoro when paralyzed. Be careful not to burn through Cresselia's Moonlight, as once its mere 8 PP has been used, Cresselia will struggle to check threats like Salazzle and Choice Scarf Flygon. Be careful to not give Pokemon like Escavalier, Ninetales, and Metagross a free switch, since they can do a great amount of damage. Use Cresselia to consistently check Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Virizion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Status absorbers like Snorlax and Seismitoad work well with Cresselia.  Cresselia works best on balance teams, so make sure to pair it up with common balance picks like hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise and Mandibuzz and Choice Scarf users such as Shaymin and Gardevoir. Pokemon that can help mitigate Cresselia's weakness to Steel-, Bug-, and Dark-types make great teammates. For example, Bewear can beat Steel-types for Cresselia, and Tyrantrum and Gardevoir can take care of Bug- and Dark-types, respectively. Clerics like Florges can work decently with Cresselia, being able to heal any status, especially Toxic poison, that Cresselia could potentially be inflicted with. Pokemon resistant to Bug like Registeel work well with Cresselia, as they can come in on threatening Bug-types like Yanmega. A plethora of Pokemon work well with Cresselia depending on which other option it utilizes. For example, setup sweepers like Virizion appreciate Cresselia's ability to cripple revenge killers like Choice Scarf Drapion and Gardevoir with Thunder Wave. They also appreciate Healing Wish to heal them late-game. Shaymin synergizes well with Hidden Power Fire Cresselia, which can beat Steel-types like Escavalier.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is an excellent choice for sun teams, as it packs a good Speed tier, offensive stats, and most importantly, bulk. It also has useful moves such as Growth and Sleep Powder to break teams by boosting up or putting a check out of commission. Venusaur is exclusively a choice for sun teams, as it is outclassed by Roserade and Shaymin otherwise. Moreover, Venusaur gets completely walled by offensive Dragon-types such as Dragalge and Goodra. These threats get a free switch into Venusaur and can threaten its team. Despite its doubled Speed in sun, Venusaur can still be offensively checked by threats such as Choice Scarf Trace Gardevoir and priority from Golisopod and Zygarde-10% if it is chipped enough by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venusaur can use a Swords Dance set with Power Whip and Earthquake, but its Attack stat prior to setting up is relatively low, and it does not become very threatening even after a boost. Substitute + Leech Seed is also optional, but Whimsicott and Shaymin are better users of those moves due to Prankster and Natural Cure, respectively. Z-Celebrate is an option, but Venusaur lacks both the power and speed to break through the opposing team after the boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Goodra and Dragalge can switch into Venusaur multiple times and KO it with their STAB moves. Noivern and Flygon can take a hit and attempt to KO Venusaur with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Specially defensive Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong take little damage from Hidden Power Fire and can either wear Venusaur down over the course of the game or set up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Gigalith</strong>: Gigalith cannot check Venusaur directly, but Sand Stream removes sun, so Venusaur cannot take advantage of Chlorophyll for the rest of the game if Torkoal is down.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ninetales and Salazzle resist Grass and can KO Venusaur easily. They also benefit from sun, as their Fire-type moves get stronger.</p>",

      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Growth increases Venusaur's Attack and Special Attack by two stages in sun, making it a threatening sweeper. Sludge Bomb is the strongest attack, hitting Fairy- and Grass-types such as Florges, Shaymin, and Virizion for super effective damage. Giga Drain takes care of bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Mega Blastoise, as well as replenishes lost HP from Life Orb recoil and damage. Solar Beam can be used over Giga Drain for more damage output at the cost of only being able to use it in sun. Hidden Power Fire is boosted in the sun and is used to hit Pokemon like Escavalier while chipping away HP from the likes of Bronzong. Sleep Powder is an alternative to Growth, allowing Venusaur to induce sleep on a threat to allow a teammate like Leafeon to set up Swords Dance much more easily. It can also be used over Sludge Bomb to make Venusaur more threatening in the sun due to Sleep Powder + Growth, but then Venusaur will heavily rely on sun to do any significant damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Modest nature are used to ensure Venusaur gets the best out of its wallbreaking capabilities. Life Orb is used to further increase Venusaur's offensive capabilities; the recoil can be ignored, as Giga Drain helps recover from the lost HP. Alternatively, Grassium Z can be used to KO a defensive threat with Bloom Doom, but it is useless otherwise. It is preferred to pair it with Solar Beam, as it gives Venusaur a way to KO a threat once they have been lured in after they realize the Grass-type STAB move is Solar Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always try to switch Venusaur into bulky Water-types, as they lack a way to threaten Venusaur, apart from Slowbro and Air Slash Mantine, and use Growth on the next turn, as they will usually switch out. Giga Drain is the most spammable STAB move and should be used over Sludge Bomb if both KO the foe, as it can recover health. Use Growth on setup fodder such as Florges and Comfey, but be wary of setting up in front of Foul Play users like Umbreon, as Growth also raises Venusaur's Attack stat. Venusaur also draws its checks in, mainly Goodra, Dragalge, and Steel-types, so use that to your advantage. It is wise to save Venusaur until late-game, as it can become a dangerous late-game sweeper. Growth should be usually used on attacks that do not KO Venusaur, as it can just replenish HP with Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Venusaur, as it sets sun, which allows Venusaur to fulfill its niche in the tier. Torkoal also helps the team by providing Stealth Rock support, as well as Explosion to weaken threats and give a free switch in opportunity for Venusaur. Ninetales is another option for a sun setter, which itself acts as a setup sweeper, making Sleep Powder Venusaur a preferred choice in that case. Chlorophyll users, especially Leafeon, are also good partners for Venusaur, as they can take care of Venusaur's Dragon-type checks, as well as benefit from Chlorophyll. Venusaur also helps Leafeon by taking care of defensive Pokemon. Wallbreakers such as Tyrantrum and Dragon Dance Zygarde-10% are appreciated; they resist Fire-type moves for Venusaur and can weaken the opposing team for Venusaur to clean.</p>"

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is an excellent offensive Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker thanks to its strong Life Orb- and Sheer Force-boosted attacks and its access to Taunt and Toxic. Its effectiveness as a Stealth Rock setter is bolstered by the fact that it beats almost every entry hazard remover in the tier thanks to its impeccable coverage. Nidoqueen's typing gives it an immunity to Electric and useful resistances that allow it to check common Pokemon. However, Nidoqueen's average Speed tier prevents it from outpacing common Pokemon such as Necrozma, Goodra, and Roserade. Nidoqueen also struggles to beat walls like Milotic, Cresselia, and Umbreon unless running Toxic or niche coverage moves. For example, it can run Thunderbolt for Milotic or Focus Blast for Umbreon. However, Nidoqueen can still struggle to break through Pokemon even when running the appropriate coverage attack; one case of this is relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast to break through Pokemon like Snorlax and the aforementioned Umbreon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt allows Nidoqueen to 2HKO Milotic and OHKO Mantine. Modest Nidoqueen with Focus Blast 2HKOes walls such as Porygon2, Umbreon, and Snorlax. Toxic Spikes wears down defensive counterplay extremely quickly, allowing Nidoqueen and its teammates to break past defensive Pokemon. However, Nidoqueen has a hard time fitting this on most sets due to its extremely good movepool. Fire Blast hits Steel-types that can switch into Earth Power, such as Bronzong and Escavalier. Choice Scarf Nidoqueen can be used as a revenge killer and soft check to Rock- and Fighting-types like Tyrantrum and Passimian. Shuca Berry Nidoqueen gives offensive teams a reliable way of beating pains like Zygarde-10% and Flygon. This set also beats opposing Nidoqueen without having to rely on winning a Speed tie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Even with Taunt or Toxic, Nidoqueen struggles to break past specially defensive Pokemon such as Cresselia, Snorlax, Porygon2, and Milotic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type attacks from common Pokemon such as Flygon and Zygarde-10% KO Nidoqueen either outright or after slight chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Super effective Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Espeon, Sigilyph, and Necrozma beat Nidoqueen.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Mega Blastoise and Aqua Jet Golisopod outpace and heavily damage Nidoqueen.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock racks up chip damage as switches are made, especially against Pokemon with a Rock weakness like Yanmega and Salazzle. Earth Power is Nidoqueen's strongest, most reliable attack. Sludge Wave is Nidoqueen's strongest move and can take out Fairy-types such as Florges and hits Pokemon with Levitate such as Cresselia and Uxie harder than Ice Beam does. Ice Beam hits Flying-types such as Mandibuzz and Noivern and Ground-types like Donphan and Flygon super effectively. Toxic allows Nidoqueen to put a timer on Pokemon that completely wall it such as Cresselia and Porygon2. Taunt lets Nidoqueen prevent Defog and other status moves such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. It can also stop walls such as Porygon2 and Cresselia from recovering health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Nidoqueen outpace Pokemon like Cloyster and Metagross. 252 EVs invested into Special Attack let Nidoqueen hit as hard as possible. Sheer Force and Life Orb bolster Nidoqueen’s damage output. A Modest nature can be used so Nidoqueen can hit walls like Umbreon and Porygon2 much harder at the cost of being outpaced by Pokemon such as Jolly Tsareena, Honchkrow, and Modest Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to position Nidoqueen against Pokemon it forces it out early-game so it can freely set up Stealth Rock. However, if you can’t achieve this, Nidoqueen set up Stealth Rock later in the game against Pokemon that are Choice-locked into resisted attacks like Tyrantrum's Head Smash and Gardevoir's Moonblast. Make sure to use Toxic on potential switch-ins such as Porygon2 and Cresselia, as it prevents them from switching into attacks multiple times throughout a game. Play wisely when the opponent has Pokemon immune to Earth Power that can outpace and KO Nidoqueen such as Sigilyph and Flygon, as they may try to aggressively switch them in. Use Taunt liberally against walls that might be trying to heal such as Umbreon and Porygon2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A plethora of setup sweepers, including Salazzle, Dragon Dance Tyrantrum, and Raikou, appreciate Nidoqueen's ability to soften the opposition with Stealth Rock and shut down walls with Taunt or Toxic. For example, Tyrantrum enjoys Nidoqueen’s ability to cripple Pokemon like Milotic lacking Refresh and Pyukumuku. Wallbreakers such as Escavalier and Bewear are great teammates, as they can help deal with walls like Cresselia and Umbreon, which Nidoqueen struggles with. Roserade synergizes well with Nidoqueen, as it can set Spikes to aid Nidoqueen in wallbreaking, act as a switch-in to Water-type attacks like Scald from Milotic, and potentially use Sleep Powder to prevent Pokemon like Mantine from using Defog. Pokemon like Raikou, Mega Glalie, and Arcanine are able to take advantage of Pokemon that Nidoqueen is weak to, such as Mega Blastoise, Life Orb Roserade, and Vanilluxe, respectively.</p>"

It also gets great coverage in Solar Beam to beat Water- and Rock-types and Hidden Power Ice for Noivern and Flygon. Also, Drought combined with its good special bulk makes Ninetales more effective against Water-types than any of its competitors. However, while Ninetales has decent Speed, it still is vulnerable to faster attackers such as Zygarde-10% and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, which can revenge kill it. Ninetales also faces stiff competition from similar attackers like Salazzle, which can also utilize Nasty Plot and has better Speed, better Special Attack, and a secondary type for coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flame Charge could be used to increase Ninetales's Speed to become more threatening against offense, but this would be at the cost of Nasty Plot or Hidden Power Ice. Will-O-Wisp over Hidden Power Ice is another option, which can catch physical attackers, specifically Hariyama and Gigalith. However, this makes Ninetales more vulnerable against Flygon and Noivern. Grassium Z is another option, as it grants Ninetales the ability to break past Gigalith, Diancie, and Assault Vest Slowking with a +2 boosted Bloom Doom. Life Orb can be utilized to increase instant damage without removing Ninetales's ability to set up but will at the same time wear Ninetales down, decreasing its ability to set up. A Heat Rock set can be used to support sun teams, but that would limit Ninetales's ability to wallbreak. Psyshock can be used over Hidden Power Ice to hit Dragalge harder, but misses out on Pokemon like Noivern and Flygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense and a Fire resistance like Goodra and Thick Fat Snorlax take any of Ninetales's moves and can in return heavily damage or outright KO it. Assault Vest Slowking can check Ninetales using Future Sight and Scald but has to look out for Grassium Z variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Because of Ninetales's limited Speed, faster attackers such as Zygarde-10%, Aerodactyl, Swellow, Noivern, and common Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Tyrantrum can check or revenge kill it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Specially defensive Diancie can take a +2 Solar Beam and retaliate with Diamond Storm. Gigalith is specifically worrisome, as it removes sun with Sand Stream and increases its own Special Defense simultaneously. Both of these still have to look out for a +2 Doom Bloom, however, as that will OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, paralysis, and even Toxic all can hinder Ninetales ability to set up and sweep. Because of this, walls like Registeel and Cresselia become riskier to use as setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Ninetales's Special Attack enough to OHKO the vast majority of Pokemon. Fire Blast is Ninetales's main and most powerful attack. It alone is able to threaten a KO against anything that doesn't resist Fire. Solar Beam greatly complements this by giving Ninetales almost all the needed coverage to hit Rock- and Water-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Milotic, and Slowking. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice gives coverage against Noivern and Tyrantrum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack and Speed EVs maximize Ninetales's damage output and speed. With a Timid nature, Ninetales can Speed tie with maximum Speed Shaymin and Mega Glalie. Firium Z gives Ninetales the ability to break past defensive walls and open the way for a teammate to sweep. Notable KOs with Inferno Overdrive include Nidoqueen, Gardevoir, and Necrozma after Stealth Rock damage and, if Ninetales is at +2, Cresselia, Umbreon, and Mega Ampharos.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not directly switch Ninetales into any neutral attacks, as that will hinder its ability to set up at a later point. Only attempt to set up against Pokemon that can't hurt Ninetales like Fairy-types such as Florges and weaker Grass-types such as Rotom-C. Ninetales can also use passive walls like Registeel and Umbreon as setup fodder, but watch out for status like Toxic or Thunder Wave. Before all this you need to make sure answers like Thick Fat Snorlax are removed before attempting to sweep. Having your own Stealth Rock or Spikes on the field greatly improves Ninetales's ability to wallbreak. Finally, utilizing slow U-turn or Volt Switch users gives you more opportunities to safely come in and set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ninetales works best on offensive and balance-oriented teams that can provide additional offensive presence or momentum gain. Pokemon such as Noivern can use U-turn and Choice lock walls with Switcheroo. Choice Scarf Flygon can be a worthy partner for its ability to beat Gigalith and Goodra, and Flygon also has access to U-turn to pivot out of its bulkier counters, which Ninetales can then use as setup fodder. Shaymin can also synergize greatly, as it's able to check Gigalith and Diancie whereas Ninetales can use most of Shaymin's walls in Registeel, Umbreon and Cresselia as setup fodder. Furthermore, a Choice Scarf set can provide much-appreciated Healing Wish support. Victreebel can also be considered for its ability to check Diancie and take advantage of Sun using its Chlorophyll ability. It should be noted, however, that Victreebel won't be able to reliably take advantage of this weather condition, so making those turns count is important. Complementary wallbreakers include Bewear and Gardevoir, which pressure any wall that could stop Ninetales. Additionally, Choice Scarf Gardevoir is capable of providing Healing Wish support. Rhyperior and Gigalith both provide Stealth Rock and also deal with faster attackers like Swellow and Aerodactyl. Lastly, having entry hazard removal makes it harder to whittle down Ninetales. Ideal users such as Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Tsareena can fulfill this need and beat Gigalith and Diancie, two common Stealth Rock users.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat is a very powerful STAB move due to receiving boosts from both Choice Specs and Drought, capable of 2HKOing even extremely bulky Pokemon like specially defensive Mandibuzz after Stealth Rock damage; however, it lowers Ninetales's Special Attack by two stages upon use. Although it isn't as strong as Overheat, Fire Blast provides Ninetales with a secondary, more spammable STAB attack. Flamethrower can be used instead to give Ninetales a more reliable means of finishing off weakened foes such as Machamp. Solar Beam pairs nicely with Ninetales's STAB moves, since allows Ninetales to threaten bulky Rock- and Water-types like Rhyperior, Milotic, Mega Blastoise, and Slowking. Hidden Power Ice rounds out Ninetales's coverage, letting it threaten Dragon-types that are resistant to Fire such as Noivern, Tyrantrum, Dragalge, and Choice Scarf Flygon. Psyshock can be used instead to deal more consistent damage to Dragalge and Hariyama, though these are the only targets that it hits, limiting its usefulness.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack in tandem with Choice Specs allows Ninetales to hit as hard possible, while maximum investment in Speed and a Timid nature allow it to outrun Pokemon like Drapion, Roserade, and Yanmega. Drought summons sun for five turns, which is useful for increasing the power of Ninetales's STAB moves and reducing the turns needed to use Solar Beam from two to one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Ninetales should mainly be used to wallbreak early- and mid-game, since this can pave the way for a teammate to have an easier time finishing the opposing team off late-game. Switching Ninetales in on stronger, neutral attacks from Pokemon like Gardevoir is ill advised, especially if Stealth Rock is on its side of the field, due to it lacking the bulk to handle stronger attacks and this cutting into its longevity; however, Ninetales can switch in on weaker or resisted attacks from Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Vanilluxe. The ideal methods of getting Ninetales in are on predicted double switches to Pokemon like Bronzong and Roserade, through the use of U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate has been KOed in order to revenge kill the foe. Since Ninetales is Choice locked, prediction plays a major role in it succeeding at wallbreaking; for example, if it predicts a Water- or Rock-type to switch in, it should use Solar Beam. Once these Pokemon have been removed, Ninetales is free to spam its STAB moves. Ninetales can also take advantage of the switches it forces by doubling into a teammate that can take advantage of the Pokemon that switched in, like Virizion against Pokemon like Gigalith. Exercise caution when using Overheat if the opponent has a Pokemon like Barbaracle that can take advantage of Ninetales being locked into it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ninetales appreciates being paired with entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, Forretress and Rotom-C due to its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock. The latter three are also capable of bringing Ninetales in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch. Conversely, Ninetales also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Metagross, Rhyperior, and Roserade to guarantee certain OHKOs and 2HKOs such as on Mega Blastoise with Solar Beam and on Cresselia with Overheat, respectively. Since Ninetales struggles with breaking through certain specially bulky Pokemon like Snorlax and Gigalith, it appreciates being paired with powerful physical wallbreakers that can pressure them like Tyrantrum, Escavalier, and Bewear, with Ninetales being able to remove physically bulky Pokemon like Forretress as well as bulkier entry hazard setters like Metagross and Rhyperior with the appropriate coverage move. Grass-types such as Virizion, Shaymin, and Roserade synergize well with Ninetales due to their ability to deal with Water- and Rock-types like Mega Blastoise, Milotic, and Diancie, with the former also being capable of taking on Pokemon like Snorlax for Ninetales. Shaymin and Roserade especially appreciate the removal of Steel-types and can provide useful Healing Wish and Spikes support, respectively. Ninetales appreciates having pivots, such as Flygon and Raikou, as teammates due to their ability to get Ninetales into play safely against Pokemon that they tend to bait in like Bronzong and Registeel. Late-game cleaners like Zygarde-10% and Choice Scarf Gardevoir appreciate Ninetales breaking through bulky Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Tangela, and Bronzong and have a much easier time finishing teams off as a result, with the latter being able to cripple Ninetales's switch-ins with Trick and also provide useful Healing Wish support should Ninetales get worn down too quickly.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Golbat's vast utility options combined with its typing and Eviolite-boosted bulk make it an exceptional stallbreaker. Its access to Taunt, Toxic, Super Fang, and Defog allow Golbat to beat passive walls and Stealth Rock setters such as Milotic, Registeel, and Bronzong. Golbat can also find many opportunities to come into battle thanks to its Eviolite-boosted bulk, access to Roost, immunity to Toxic, and ability to switch into prominent threats such as Golisopod, Roserade, and Toxicroak. However, Golbat is heavily pressured by Stealth Rock, since it is forced to use Roost before it can clear the entry hazard, which makes it easier to take advantage of. Golbat is also reliant on Eviolite for its bulk, which makes it vulnerable to Knock Off and Trick users. Golbat faces heavy competition from Sigilyph and Florges as a Defog user, since they are less passive and are not weak to Stealth Rock. Noivern also gives Golbat hefty competition as a stallbreaker because it is much less passive than Golbat.</p>",

This option is difficult to use over Golbat's other, arguably superior utility moves, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Since Golbat is constantly switching into entry hazards and resisted hits, it usually is forced to use Roost before it can do anything, which can make Golbat more passive and more easily pressured by wallbreakers.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Donphan, Passimian, and Drapion can pressure Golbat by removing its Eviolite, which it needs to check certain threats.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Tyrantrum, and Raikou don't care about many of Golbat's moves and can retaliate back with super effective moves. Other Pokemon like Virizion, Machamp, and Nidoqueen can carry coverage moves to beat Golbat, too.</p> <p><strong>Faster Stallbreakers</strong>: Although Golbat is quite bulky, it falls prey to rival stallbreakers such as Mismagius, Houndoom, and Noivern, which all turn Golbat into setup fodder.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Golbat's strongest STAB move and allows it to beat Pokemon such as Shaymin, Machamp, and Bewear. Defog can allow Golbat to clear entry hazards, further pressuring Pokemon like Roserade and Golisopod. Taunt and Toxic can shut down passive Pokemon such as Milotic, Diancie, and Cresselia. Super Fang is an interesting move to chip away at bulky Pokemon that are immune to Toxic such as Registeel and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with 16 Speed EVs allows Golbat to outspeed maximum Speed Machamp, Adamant Honchkrow, and Pokemon with base 60 Speed such as Bewear. The rest of the EVs are invested in Golbat's physical bulk so it can take as many resisted hits as possible. Infiltrator bypasses Substitute and screens, making Golbat less passive.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golbat should use its bulk and typing to come in against Pokemon such as Roserade, Toxicroak, and Golisopod. It can also switch in against Pokemon like Registeel and Bronzong as they set Stealth Rock, as well as passive Pokemon like Mantine and Slowbro as they go for Toxic. Despite its solid bulk, Golbat should be cautious of switching into Knock Off because it relies on Eviolite for its defensive utility. It also should be cautious of switching into super effective coverage moves from Pokemon that it normally can beat like Machamp, Virizion, and Milotic. Golbat's Stealth Rock weakness makes it harder to check certain Pokemon, so optimal plays need to be made to let it safely come in and use Defog. Also, be cautious of using Roost, since Golbat loses its Flying typing as it recovers HP, making it easier for Pokemon with Ground-type coverage like Metagross to beat it. Avoid status conditions as much as possible, as they can hinder Golbat's ability to check certain threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golbat fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that need a stallbreaker and a reliable check to Bug-, Fighting-, and Fairy-types. Defensive teammates such as Registeel, Cresselia, and Goodra appreciate Golbat's ability to check these types. Other partners such as Necrozma, Tangela, Metagross, and Machamp can help check Pokemon that Golbat loses to such as Tyrantrum, Raikou, and Nidoqueen. Tyrantrum and Machamp also appreciate Golbat's ability to wear down their defensive checks with Super Fang. Bulky Z-Move users like Cresselia, Slowbro, and Bewear can help Golbat by taking Knock Off for it. Other entry hazard removers such as Donphan, Mega Blastoise, and Sigilyph can take pressure off of Golbat so that it can focus on stallbreaking. Since Golbat may switch into Stealth Rock often, a Wish passer or Healing Wish user like Vaporeon, Florges, or Gardevoir can help Golbat by recovering its health as it switches into the entry hazard.</p>"

  "Arcanine": {
    "overview": "<p>Arcanine is one of RarelyUsed's prominent Fire-type Pokemon because it has the stats, movepool, and abilities to shine as a wallbreaker. Thanks to its good offenses and movepool, Arcanine can reliably 2HKO almost every defensive Pokemon in the metagame as well as threaten Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma, Metagross, and Registeel. Flash Fire notably allows it to be one of the best counters to Ninetales in the tier. Arcanine also has a good Speed tier, outpacing offensive threats such as Roserade, Gardevoir, and Metagross. Despite those great traits, Arcanine's biggest flaw is that it is easily worn down by Stealth Rock, Flare Blitz recoil, and Life Orb, limiting the number of times it can safely switch in and compromising its potential as a check to Fire-types. Arcanine relies heavily on prediction, so one wrong prediction can leave it helpless against Pokemon such as Milotic, Mega Blastoise, and Golisopod. Fast threats such as Raikou and Zygarde-10% as well as common Choice Scarf users such as Tyrantrum, Drapion, and Flygon can outpace Arcanine. However, Extreme Speed does help against these threats if they are weakened. Arcanine faces competition as a Fire-type from Ninetales and Salazzle, which have better Speed tiers, boost their stats, and, in Ninetales's case, can reliably OHKO bulky Water-type Pokemon with Solar Beam. Arcanine also has competition as a Fire-type check with Houndoom, as Houndoom can also check Psychic-types and has a better matchup against bulkier teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Close Combat can be used considering the considerable damage it deals to Pokemon that resist Flare Blitz such as Snorlax, Tyrantrum, and Rhyperior. A mixed offensive set using a Hasty nature and Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal decent damage to Pokemon such as Flygon, as well as OHKO Noivern after Stealth Rock. Arcanine prefers the coverage it has with Close Combat, however. Defensive Arcanine seems appealing thanks to Intimidate and moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Morning Sun, and Roar. However, Arcanine is a mediocre wall because it is weak to Stealth Rock and Toxic damage and its defensive stats are only average at best. Choice Band can be run instead of Life Orb to grant Arcanine more power, but Arcanine prefers to switch its moves around and be able to recover its HP with Morning Sun. Intimidate can also be run to reduce the power of physically offensive Pokemon like Machamp, but Arcanine loses out on countering Ninetales, which is one of its main selling points.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards like Stealth Rock limit Arcanine's chances to be brought into battle, since it is vulnerable to every entry hazard in the game. Arcanine is also prone to being worn down by the recoil from Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and its own Life Orb.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Arcanine has very common weaknesses in Water, Rock, and Ground, which are easily exploited by Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Tyrantrum, and Zygarde-10%. Other Pokemon such as Metagross and Virizion can also carry coverage moves that score super effective damage on Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Defensive Water-type Pokemon can give Arcanine trouble, because all of them can come in on Flare Blitz and proceed to threaten Arcanine out. Slowbro in particular is only 3HKOed by Wild Charge and easily recovers the damage dealt to it with Slack Off and Regenerator. Rhyperior completely walls Arcanine's STAB moves and even stomachs one Close Combat before revenge killing it with its STAB moves. Opposing Arcanine also come in for free on Flare Blitz and forces it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Many faster Pokemon such as Lycanroc-D, Salazzle, and Zygarde-10% can revenge kill Arcanine or threaten it out. Some of them such as Gardevoir and Tyrantrum can carry a Choice Scarf to get the jump on Arcanine. Setup sweepers such as Barbaracle, Dragon Dance Tyrantrum, and Flygon threaten Arcanine out by boosting their Speed. Pokemon such as Noivern can hurt Arcanine because they target its weaker Special Defense. Running Extreme Speed does help against these Pokemon, especially if they have been weakened prior. Arcanine can also afford taking a hit from these Pokemon as long as they don't run super effective coverage.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's strongest STAB move, heavily damaging or KOing Pokemon like Shaymin, Metagross, and Bewear. Wild Charge is Arcanine's best tool for hitting Water-type Pokemon. It has the power to OHKO Mantine and Araquanid while 2HKOing Mega Blastoise, Milotic, and Golisopod. Morning Sun recovers the recoil and damage Arcanine has sustained. Extreme Speed is great to reliably revenge kill weakened faster threats such as Raikou, Zygarde-10%, and Flygon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature and a Life Orb allow Arcanine to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. Flash Fire boosts Arcanine's Flare Blitz to insane levels after it is hit by a rival's Fire-type move. Using a Z-Crystal such as Firium Z or Electrium Z can ease prediction for Arcanine by giving it a one-time nuke to OHKO Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, and Milotic. Said Z-Moves also don't deal recoil damage, meaning Arcanine doesn't necessarily have to use Morning Sun in its set. However, keep in mind that Arcanine is weaker after using its Z-Move compared to Life Orb variants.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arcanine is a wallbreaker that can come in early- to mid-game as long as entry hazards are cleared. If running Extreme Speed, Arcanine can also be brought late-game to act as a cleaner by picking off weakened threats. Arcanine can safely come in on Pokemon like Ninetales thanks to its Fire typing and Flash Fire. It also can try to come in when predicting that a passive Pokemon such as Registeel will not use Toxic. Arcanine forces a lot of switches, so use Wild Charge or Morning Sun if you predict the opponent to switch to a Water-type like Mega Blastoise, Milotic, or Golisopod. Arcanine is heavily worn down by Stealth Rock and recoil from Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Life Orb, so try not to switch Arcanine in too frequently and keep hazards off when it does come in. Using a pivot is also preferred so that Arcanine can get the jump on a foe it can threaten.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers are mandatory teammates for Arcanine so that it doesn't lose a quarter of its health every time it comes into battle. Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Mantine, and Forretress fit this role excellently. Water-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Shaymin, Toxicroak, Mantine, and Seismitoad help absorb Water-type moves that target Arcanine. They also help Arcanine by threatening Water-types so that Arcanine doesn't have to predict them coming in for it to wallbreak. Pokemon like Shaymin and Virizion can check the Ground-type Pokemon that Arcanine struggles with such as Rhyperior and Donphan. Arcanine is great for taking out Steel-types for teammates like Roserade, Gardevoir, and Noivern, as well as checking Fire-types for teammates like Toxicroak, Shaymin, and Metagross. Pokemon like Noivern, Yanmega, and Salazzle appreciate Arcanine's ability to threaten Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross, Necrozma, and Nidoqueen with chip damage. Special walls such as Registeel, Snorlax, and Florges can help sponge special hits that target Arcanine's weaker defensive stat. A slow pivot such as Mandibuzz, Mega Ampharos, or Forretress can bring Arcanine in on a foe it can threaten safely. Fast pivots such as Raikou, Yanmega, and Flygon also help Arcanine safely come into battle by threatening out the foe with their powerful attacks.</p>"

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>Machamp's niche over other Fighting-types in the RU tier is its ability Guts, which can transform it into a powerful wallbreaker with Flame Orb, boasting over 590 Attack, while maintaining the flexibility to switch its moves and not worry about Toxic. Machamp's STAB move usefully threatens many of the tier's Stealth Rock setters, including Registeel, Rhyperior, and Gigalith, and the rest of its movepool allows it to either OHKO or 2HKO the remainder of the metagame. Even stall teams have little in the way of checks for Machamp, as Close Combat, Knock Off, and Facade can break through everything in conjunction with Machamp's Guts-boosted power and ability to switch moves. However, Machamp competes for a spot with Bewear and Pangoro, the tier's other premier Fighting-types, which both have access to Swords Dance along with better physical bulk in the former's case and a stronger Knock Off for the latter. In addition, without defensive investment, Machamp is fairly easy to revenge kill due to its poor Speed tier and lack of a STAB priority move, and it is worn down quickly thanks to residual damage stacking up from Flame Orb and pivoting into entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Machamp's niche in RU is as a Guts wallbreaker or Assault Vest user, and aside from that it does not have much going for it. Earthquake guarantees the OHKO on Nidoqueen after a Guts boost, unlike Ice Punch. Heavy Slam gives Machamp the potential to OHKO Florges.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Espeon, Cresselia, and Sigilyph can outspeed Machamp and revenge kill it with their super effective STAB moves, though none appreciate switching in on a Knock Off or Facade. Cresselia also needs heavy Speed investment to outspeed Machamp.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Gardevoir, Slurpuff, and Florges can come in on Machamp and OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves, though they have to beware Bullet Punch, and even Florges is 2HKOed by Facade.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: A plethora of Pokemon in the tier can revenge kill Machamp, such as Salazzle and Zygarde-10%, as well as some of the Fighting-types Machamp competes with in Bewear and Pangoro.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and Flame Orb can quickly wear Machamp down, causing it to be picked off by faster Pokemon or priority moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Machamp's most powerful STAB move, capable of decimating virtually any nonresistant target, and it can be spammed when Ghost-types are not present. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types capable of switching into Machamp's STAB Close Combat, principally Mismagius, Slowbro, and Cresselia, along with removing items. Facade gives Machamp a strong alternative to Close Combat that will not lower its defenses, and it heavily damages common Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Noivern, Florges, and Araquanid. Priority Bullet Punch makes Machamp more useful versus offensively inclined teams and threatens faster offensive Fairy-types such as Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Machamp to hit as hard as possible while ensuring it will outspeed the plethora of defensive Pokemon in the tier. Flame Orb allows Machamp to safely trigger Guts to boost its Attack and Facade's Base Power, turning Machamp into a powerful wallbreaker. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed and obliterate Adamant Bewear and Pangoro.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Play Machamp aggressively, bringing it on double switches expecting the opponent to send in a Pokemon it threatens out, such as Registeel or Umbreon. Use Facade liberally, as it provides a high-Base Power move that comes without drawback and can 2HKO a majority of switch-ins along with one of Machamp's coverage moves. Be careful to preserve Close Combat PP against stall teams, as they will often attempt to Protect stall your team and pivot around in order to waste PP due to them lacking proper switch-ins to Machamp's Guts-boosted attacks. Be wary of leading with Machamp, as without Guts activated it will be significantly weaker on the first turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Mismagius, Gardevoir, and Espeon, whose ability to dent a team is hindered by the presence of Registeel or Umbreon, appreciate Machamp threatening these foes on a double switch. Healing Wish or Lunar Dance users such as Shaymin, Gardevoir, and Cresselia are also good options, as they can bring a weakened Machamp back onto the field to give it a second go at breaking through teams that relied on wearing it down. Pokemon providing VoltTurn support, such as Raikou, Swellow, and Mega Ampharos, can get Machamp in for free to fire off a powerful attack. Rhyperior and Registeel can come in on Flying-types such as Noivern and Golbat, which can force Machamp out if they find a way in, and they also provide Stealth Rock support for your team. Nidoqueen appreciates Machamp weakening their shared check in Cresselia, and vice versa, while supporting the team by setting up Stealth Rock. Escavalier can come in on and often Pursuit trap faster Psychic-types and force out Fairy-types that threaten Machamp.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat's power and accuracy make it the optimal STAB attack, though the defensive stat drops cause Machamp to get quickly weakened by healthy Mega Blastoise and easily forced out after getting a KO. Knock Off annoys any Pokemon reliant on Leftovers and keeps Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Necrozma and Mismagius from safely switching in. Ice Punch provides good coverage without defensive drops like Close Combat and OHKOes Roserade and Noivern. Alternatively, Thunder Punch lets Machamp 2HKO Mega Blastoise without losing most of its HP in the process and catches Water-types that might try to check it such as Golisopod and Mantine. Bullet Punch is necessary to keep Gardevoir and Florges from being consistent answers to Machamp. It can also be handy against weakened sweepers, but it needs to be super effective or Guts boosted to deal much damage. Facade is an option if you want to improve Machamp's matchup against defensive teams, where it's likely to get statused, at the expense of coverage against offense. Guts-boosted Facade deals massive damage to Psychic-types that otherwise check Machamp like Cresselia and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest gives Machamp the special bulk to take almost any special attack that isn't a boosted or super effective Z-Move. This makes Machamp extremely difficult for offensive teams to take down without losing valuable Pokemon in the process. Guts works with Assault Vest to let Machamp switch into Water-types' Scald and become even more powerful if burned. It also makes Toxic, which common Pokemon like Registeel will send Machamp's way, much less of an issue. Maximum HP is necessary for checking special attackers such as Mega Blastoise as effectively as possible. 56 Speed EVs are enough to let Machamp outpace Mega Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against offensive teams, Machamp should try to switch in for free so it can take hits and KO back. Chances to switch in come from predicted switches to bulky Pokemon like Registeel and Milotic as well as to threatening special attackers such as Roserade and Ninetales. It makes for an excellent lead, as few Pokemon can immediately threaten it with an OHKO and it beats common Stealth Rock setters such as Registeel and Bronzong. If it needs to switch in on something, it should switch in on a passive, status-reliant wall like Registeel or Milotic; inexperienced opponents might take your Machamp's lack of Flame Orb to mean it's using No Guard, so even if Machamp doesn't get statused on the switch, it might in subsequent turns. Another source of switch-in opportunities is Mega Blastoise if running Thunder Punch; only its Aura Sphere does much damage. Should an offensive foe let itself get KOed to hit Machamp hard, Machamp will likely be left too weak to check anything else. Thus, Machamp is often limited to forcing a trade; make the Pokemon it trades with a valuable team component like Mega Blastoise so the opponent will be at the greater disadvantage. Try to get Machamp burned or paralyzed as soon as possible against defensive teams so it can start wallbreaking. Toxic poison also works, but it takes Machamp down much faster. Machamp should prioritize eliminating Pokemon that keep teammates from sweeping, as it's unlikely to last long enough to win on its own.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cleaners like Raikou and Zygarde-10% love having Machamp to weaken Steel- or Water-types that can stop them. Stealth Rock setters that struggle against Mega Blastoise such as Metagross and Rhyperior benefit from Machamp weakening or KOing it. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can provide Healing Wish to make Machamp a threat all over again, outpaces the many offensive Pokemon that can revenge kill Machamp, and appreciates a Pokemon that punishes Steel-types so heavily. Machamp without Thunder Punch can't consistently answer Mega Blastoise, so consider pairing such Machamp with a Grass-type like Roserade or Shaymin. They enjoy weakened Steel-types and pressured Noivern to boot. Pretty much any aggressive team will find Assault Vest Machamp's ability to threaten offense and defense alike useful. It's quite self-sufficient and doesn't stack many weaknesses.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro's excellent defensive typing and great defensive stats allow it to act as a physical blanket check to key offensive Pokemon in the tier like Metagross and Tyrantrum. Its resistance to Fighting-type moves is particularly noteworthy, letting it switch into various threats such as Passimian, Toxicroak, and Bewear with ease. This is achieved thanks to Slowbro's exceptional longevity; its combination of Regenerator and Slack Off ensures it will be able to pivot into physical attackers throughout the whole match. Unfortunately, Slowbro faces competition from the other Water- and Psychic-types in the tier, such as Milotic, Mantine, and Necrozma, although unlike the former two, it is able to avoid passivity issues due to its decent Special Attack combined with a good offensive movepool. Although its typing blesses it with important resistances, it is also cursed with multiple weaknesses to common offensive typings like Grass, Dark, and Electric, which makes Slowbro vulnerable to powerful threats like Shaymin, Mega Blastoise, and Raikou. Additionally, it can get chipped for big damage or removed from the game entirely by trappers such as Drapion and Escavalier. Slowbro is also unable to dent most Water-types like Milotic and Mega Blastoise unless running the niche Grass Knot or Toxic. Finally, its mediocre Special Defense stat leaves it unable to wall specially offensive threats such as Noivern and Nidoqueen.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect allows Slowbro to avoid Pursuit mind games, bait Z-Moves, and rack up Leftovers healing. However, it is important to note that Slowbro really needs all its coverage to hit its targets. Waterium Z can prevent Slowbro from being crippled by Trick users like Medicham and Metagross, reduce the damage from Knock Off from the likes of Machamp, and allows Slowbro to drop a Water-type nuke that heavily dents most offensive Pokemon such as Drapion, Pangoro, and Escavalier. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to punish fast attackers and cleaners like Virizion and Mismagius on the switch. Rindo Berry lets Slowbro deal with Grass-types better, particularly Virizion, which takes substantial damage from Slowbro's Psyshock. Yawn can force switches versus Pokemon it loses to and help another teammate set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Virizion can all threaten to KO Slowbro with their STAB moves. Although most fear switching into Ice Beam or Psyshock, they become far more solid checks if they're running Synthesis. Although Electric-types are somewhat uncommon, Raikou, Mega Ampharos, and Rotom-C can all switch into it with ease and obtain momentum with Volt Switch, or in Raikou's case, set up with Calm Mind. Mega Ampharos can even switch in on its base forme to weaken Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro is unable to dent Water-types unless running Toxic or Grass Knot. Most offensive Water-types carry super effective moves like Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse or Araquanid's Leech Life, while defensive Water-types can take advantage of Slowbro by Defogging, recovering, or passing Wish.</p> <p><strong>Specially Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense, special attackers like Noivern and Nidoqueen can easily break through it.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic puts a timer on Slowbro's time on the field and negates Regenerator's healing effect. It forces Slowbro to either switch constantly or use Slack Off more than it would like. Additionally, Toxic completely invalidates Calm Mind variants from sweeping.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock hits many Pokemon that resist Scald, such as Virizion, Roserade, and Toxicroak. Ice Beam targets Grass-types like Shaymin and Mega Sceptile, along with Dragon-types such as Noivern, that resist Scald and take little damage from Psyshock. Calm Mind can be used to make Slowbro a bulky setup sweeper and wall more specially offensive threats like Necrozma. Grass Knot allows Slowbro to hit Water-types like Milotic, Mega Blastoise, and Slowking, which otherwise completely wall it. Toxic lets Slowbro whittle its defensive checks such as Mega Blastoise, Cresselia, Mandibuzz, and non-Refresh Milotic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers allows Slowbro to passively regain health every turn, which can ease pressure off repeated uses of Slack Off or constant switching. Alternatively, Colbur Berry is an option that helps it when faced with a Dark-type like Drapion or Pangoro or Pokemon with Dark-type coverage like Mega Blastoise, Toxicroak, Machamp, and Donphan. Regenerator allows Slowbro to pivot into most neutral physical attacks with ease and takes pressure off using Slack Off repeatedly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike other defensive Pokemon, Slowbro should avoid spamming Slack Off due to its ability to regain health through Regenerator; this usually makes attacking with its STAB moves or Ice Beam more beneficial, although neglecting Slack Off completely isn't ideal either. Use Slack Off when Slowbro can't KO the opposing Pokemon quickly and its HP is low. Scald should be used most of the time due to its decent power and useful chance to burn. However, if the opposing team has a Water-resistant Pokemon such as Shaymin, Goodra, or Roserade, try to predict if the opponent will switch into it and use the appropriate coverage move. Slowbro should exploit its access to Regenerator and high Defense by switching into Pokemon it walls or threatens such as Toxicroak and Zygarde-10% throughout the game, forcing them out and regaining most of the health lost in the process. Slowbro should avoid staying in on special attackers such as Gardevoir and Ninetales due to its mediocre Special Defense stat, which means most decently strong special attacks can severely dent it. Walls such as Registeel and Cresselia often run Toxic to cripple Slowbro and severely limit its longevity on the field. Scout for potential Toxic users before sending Slowbro out to beat them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragalge and Goodra appreciate Slowbro's ability to deal with most physical Dragon-types like Zygarde-10% and Tyrantrum, while they easily switch into Grass- and Electric-types like Shaymin, Roserade, and Raikou. Fairy-types like Florges and Diancie can deal with most Dark- and Bug-types that Slowbro struggles with, such as Pangoro and Yanmega. Pokemon that invite the Pokemon Slowbro walls appreciate its ability to wall them. Some examples include Salazzle baiting in Flygon and Virizion luring Toxicroak. Mega Abomasnow appreciates a switch-in to dangerous Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-types, and in return it can switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks thrown at Slowbro, as well as pressure the Water-types Slowbro hates. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges and Bronzong can take pressure off Slowbro from checking special attackers like Gardevoir and Noivern. Additionally, Florges can provide Aromatherapy support to rid Slowbro of pesky status, while Bronzong can set Stealth Rock to further support the whole team.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster's unique access to Spikes, Shell Smash, Skill Link, and Icicle Spear allows it to act as a potentially fearsome wallbreaker or sweeper that can bypass Substitute and Sturdy as well as pressuring rival entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen and Rhyperior while being able to set up hazards itself. Thanks to its enormous Defense and use of Focus Sash, Cloyster is almost guaranteed to set up either Shell Smash or one layer of Spikes. While those attributes sound incredibly appealing in RU's more offensive metagame, keep in mind that Cloyster lacks coverage to hit common Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Bronzong super effectively. Cloyster's Defense is amazing, but its Special Defense combined with its relatively low unboosted Speed usually leaves it threatened out by Pokemon like Roserade, Raikou, Gardevoir, and Mega Sceptile prior to boosting. Its bad defensive typing also leaves it vulnerable to all entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, and Fighting-types like Machamp, Toxicroak, and Bewear. It also has to be cautious of Taunt from Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Houndoom, and Vanilluxe, which stops it from setting up Spikes or boosting with Shell Smash, making it much less dangerous. Cloyster is also shut down by status conditions, cutting its sweep short. Even if Cloyster does set up, it is easily shut down by priority moves such as Bullet Punch from Machamp and Accelerock from Lycanroc-D. Cloyster faces a lot of competition for a spot on a team. As a physically offensive Water-type, it has to compete against Barbaracle and Golisopod because both of them have a stronger offensive presence before boosting and are better at pressuring Steel-types. As a Spikes setter, Roserade and Golisopod are arguably more appealing because Roserade is faster, applies immediate offensive pressure without having to set up, and has all the tools it needs to pressure entry hazard removers, while Cloyster usually has to resort to Explosion, and Golisopod does not have Cloyster's Fighting weakness, can pressure Steel-types with Liquidation, has priority in Aqua Jet and First Impression, and can pivot with Emergency Exit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out offensive set with Shell Smash / Icicle Spear / Hydro Pump / Explosion and Normalium Z makes Cloyster even more threatening late-game, especially when its checks and counters are softened or KOed. However, this set has some competition with Barbaracle; while Cloyster is better at luring Water-types, has a Ground neutrality, and can set up against physically offensive Pokemon, Barbaracle is the overall better option because of its more immediate offensive pressure and ability to deal super effective damage to Steel-types. Cloyster can also set up Toxic Spikes, since it can pressure Defoggers like Mandibuzz and Florges and beat Pokemon that can absorb them such as Nidoqueen and Drapion, but it is useless against Steel-types such as Metagross and Bronzong. Ice Shard is a good option to pressure Roserade, Timid Nidoqueen, and Virizion, but Cloyster can set up to beat these Pokemon anyway. Skill Link Rock Blast is an interesting option that can deal with Pokemon that resist Icicle Spear such as Arcanine, Ninetales, and Snorlax, but Explosion already does a considerable amount of damage to these Pokemon. Cloyster can also utilize Choice Scarf to provide role compression of a Spikes setter with speed control, as well as netting a surprise KO with Explosion against Pokemon like Raikou and Ninetales. However, it fails to outspeed other Choice Scarf Pokemon like Shaymin, and it is noticeably weaker without a boost from Shell Smash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Cloyster has issues breaking Steel-types such as Metagross, Registeel, and Bronzong because it only runs Icicle Spear and Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Sceptile, Roserade, Shaymin, and Virizion can apply immediate pressure against Cloyster and force it out of the battle. However, none of them want to come in when it sets up Shell Smash or uses Icicle Spear or even the rare Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Cloyster's Ice typing leaves it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Machamp, Toxicroak, and Bewear before it can boost with Shell Smash. After it has boosted, these Pokemon need to be wary about switching directly into it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Mega Blastoise can easily take on Cloyster's Icicle Spear. However, none of them want to come in on Explosion, as it can severely dent or even OHKO them after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Raikou, Gardevoir, and Necrozma target Cloyster's weaker Special Defense stat to potentially knock it out, especially if Cloyster goes for Spikes instead of Shell Smash against them.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: After Cloyster has activated Focus Sash, it becomes vulnerable to priority moves such as Zygarde-10%'s Extreme Speed, Machamp's Bullet Punch, and Lycanroc-D's Accelerock.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Toxic can stop Cloyster from setting up entry hazards or wallbreaking and breaks its Focus Sash, severely limiting what it can do. Cloyster getting burned or paralyzed makes it lose a lot of offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Because Cloyster is not very fast, it is very vulnerable to being shut down by Taunt users such as Vanilluxe, Houndoom, and Noivern. These Pokemon also easily beat Cloyster with their powerful special moves, especially if its Focus Sash has been broken prior. However, none of these Pokemon want to directly switch into any of Cloyster's moves, especially if it has boosted with Shell Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash can turn Cloyster into a potentially threatening offensive force, as it boosts Attack and Speed by two stages. Skill Link-boosted Icicle Spear is effectively a 125-Base Power STAB move that can break Raikou's Substitute and Donphan's Sturdy. Spikes helps Cloyster's teammates sweep thanks to the residual damage it provides. Explosion gives Cloyster a way of dealing with bulky Water-types that wall Icicle Spear such as Mega Blastoise, Milotic, and Golisopod. It also can be used to stop spinners such as Mega Blastoise, Forretress, and Adamant Tsareena from removing the Spikes it sets up. Rapid Spin can be used instead to remove entry hazards from Cloyster's side of the battlefield but makes it much more vulnerable to bulky Water-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used so Cloyster can be as strong and fast as possible, especially after it boosts with Shell Smash. A Jolly nature allows Cloyster to outpace Guts Machamp and Bewear before it sets up Shell Smash. After it has used Shell Smash, Cloyster can outspeed common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Shaymin. An Adamant nature can be used instead for extra power after boosting with Shell Smash, but this usually isn't recommended because Cloyster is in a crowded Speed tier when unboosted. Adamant Cloyster also fails to outpace Choice Scarf Shaymin and Flygon. Skill Link guarantees Icicle Spear will hit five times, turning it into an effective tool to break Focus Sash, Sturdy, and Substitute. A Focus Sash allows Cloyster to survive one powerful hit so it can set up Spikes or Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cloyster can safely set up Shell Smash thanks to its enormous Defense and Focus Sash so it can pressure entry hazard setters and Taunt users like Mandibuzz. It can wallbreak or set up Spikes early on as a lead, but it can also be preserved for later to clean up. Cloyster should be played aggressively and switch directly into opposing hazard setters such as Necrozma, Rhyperior, and Nidoqueen to preserve its Focus Sash as they set up their hazards and use its Focus Sash to either set up Spikes itself or use Shell Smash so it can deal as much damage as possible. If Cloyster has used its Focus Sash and the opponent brings in a Pokemon that resists Icicle Spear such as Milotic, Snorlax, or Mega Blastoise, then it can use Explosion to dent that Pokemon or even KO it. Explosion should also be used against a spinner like Mega Blastoise or Tsareena to stop them from removing the Spikes Cloyster sets up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster's ability to pressure entry hazard setters is appreciated by Pokemon that are vulnerable to Stealth Rock such as Arcanine, Noivern, and Salazzle. These Pokemon also help Cloyster beat Steel-type Pokemon that it cannot break. Necrozma, Gardevoir, and Slowbro can also be good partners, as they have better matchups against the common Machamp and other Fighting-type leads so Cloyster can set up Spikes later. Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Espeon can help deter entry hazards with Taunt and Magic Bounce to make it easier for Cloyster to sweep late-game. Mandibuzz can also use Taunt to stop Defoggers like Mantine and Florges from removing hazards. Mismagius and Alolan Marowak can spinblock for Cloyster, as it's important to keep Cloyster's Spikes up. These two also pressure common Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Bronzong. Stealth Rock setters like Necrozma, Rhyperior, and Nidoqueen can stack hazards with Cloyster. If Cloyster is running Rapid Spin, then partners like Ninetales, Salazzle, and Yanmega appreciate Cloyster's ability to remove hazards itself. If Cloyster is used early-game to set up Spikes, late-game setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10%, Arcanine, Raikou, and Metagross will appreciate the Spikes support to help them net important KOs.</p>"

  "Marowak-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Marowak is a good wallbreaker thanks to its rare offensive typing, decent bulk, and signature item Thick Club giving a major boost to its Attack. It also has two fantastic abilities, Rock Head and Lightning Rod. The former allows it to spam a recoil-free Flare Blitz, and the latter allows it to better check Pokemon like Raikou by giving it an immunity to Electric-type moves. However, Alolan Marowak is very easily worn down by residual damage from entry hazards, Toxic damage, and weak attacks. It is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off because not only is the move super effective against it, Alolan Marowak also risks losing its main source of power, Thick Club. Alolan Marowak's poor Speed means that it is outpaced by most of RarelyUsed's offensive threats and faster walls that threaten it such as Milotic and Mandibuzz. Furthermore, Alolan Marowak has major competition as a Fire-type wallbreaker from Pokemon such as Arcanine, Ninetales, and Salazzle because of their much better Speed tiers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alolan Marowak can also function as an offensive Stealth Rock setter with its other ability Lightning Rod to check Electric-type Pokemon such as Raikou and Rotom-C. Forgoing Rock Head, however, sacrifices Alolan Marowak's ability to spam recoil-free Flare Blitz. Knock Off can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Mantine by removing their items. Alolan Marowak prefers the coverage brought by Low Kick or Earthquake, however, and most Pokemon are already threatened by Alolan Marowak's STAB moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Because of its low Speed, Alolan Marowak is easily revenge killed by faster bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Milotic, and Mantine.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Alolan Marowak is vulnerable to all entry hazards, as they cut into its longevity. Stealth Rock alone depletes a quarter of its health when it switches in. Alolan Marowak is also vulnerable to being worn down by poison damage from Toxic or Toxic Spikes. Since it lacks reliable recovery, even resisted hits chip away at Alolan Marowak's health.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Alolan Marowak can fall prey to many Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Tyrantrum, and Honchkrow because of its poor Speed tier.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Zygarde-10% and Flygon outspeed Alolan Marowak and threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Donphan can stomach a Flare Blitz from Alolan Marowak and OHKOes it in return with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Marowak's Ghost typing and overreliance on Thick Club mean it is very vulnerable to Knock Off users such as Drapion and Pangoro and Pursuit trappers such as Honchkrow. Mandibuzz can also easily OHKO Alolan Marowak with Foul Play after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Rock-types such as Tyrantrum and Lycanroc-D outspeed Alolan Marowak and can hurt it with their powerful STAB moves. Rhyperior survives one Low Kick or Earthquake if Alolan Marowak doesn't boost with Swords Dance and OHKOes it in return with its own Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Alolan Marowak's strongest STAB move, hitting insanely hard with no recoil thanks to its Rock Head ability. Shadow Bone is a very spammable secondary STAB move, thanks to the limited number of Ghost-resistant Pokemon in RarelyUsed, with a nice chance of lowering the foe's Defense. Swords Dance allows Alolan Marowak to hit even harder. Low Kick allows it to heavily damage Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, such as Rhyperior, Snorlax, and Tyrantrum. Earthquake is a decent alternative to better check Pokemon such as Arcanine, Raikou, and Mega Ampharos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with an Adamant nature allows Alolan Marowak to be as sturdy and strong as possible. 44 Speed EVs allow Alolan Marowak to outpace and dent uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Registeel and Donphan. Thick Club boosts Alolan Marowak's Attack, allowing it to act as a powerful wallbreaker. Rock Head lets Alolan Marowak use Flare Blitz without taking recoil damage. An alternative EV spread of 36 HP / 252 Atk / 220 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to outpace uninvested Mandibuzz and Milotic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Before Alolan Marowak comes into battle, make sure that all entry hazards are removed, as they cut into its longevity. In spite of its passable bulk, Alolan Marowak cannot take repeated hits. In order to get Alolan Marowak safely into the battle, bring it in after a teammate has been knocked out, use a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user, or bring Alolan Marowak in on a threat whose attacks it resists or is immune to, such as Florges, Choice Band Snorlax, or Bewear locked into a Normal- or Fighting-type move. Alolan Marowak forces many switches. Use this to either set up Swords Dance or use a coverage move to get the jump on your opponent. Do not let Alolan Marowak get poisoned from Toxic or Toxic Spikes, as poison damage racks up and eats away at its bulk. Avoid letting Alolan Marowak lose its Thick Club to Knock Off or Trick users such as Mandibuzz, Gardevoir, and Espeon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers are practically mandatory teammates to help support Alolan Marowak. Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, Mantine, and Donphan are great at this role. Teammates that resist Knock Off such as Machamp, Bewear, and Florges are also helpful, as Alolan Marowak often forces the opponent to go for the move. Mega Evolutions such as Mega Blastoise and Mega Ampharos and Z-Move users such as Virizion and Barbaracle are also noteworthy, since they are immune to Trick and don't take as much damage from Knock Off. Grass-type partners such as Shaymin, Virizion, and Tsareena can help stomach STAB moves from Ground- and Water-types aimed at Alolan Marowak and pressure them in return. Slow pivots such as Mega Ampharos and Forretress can bring Alolan Marowak safely into battle. Fast pivots such as Raikou, Noivern, and Yanmega can force switches thanks to their raw power, which allows Alolan Marowak to come in to battle safely. Clerics such as Umbreon and Healing Wish users such as Shaymin and Gardevoir can help heal any damage and status conditions Alolan Marowak has obtained.</p>"

  "Tangela": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangela carves its niche in the RU tier due to a stellar Eviolite-boosted Defense stat that allows it to check dangerous offensive Pokemon, such as Zygarde-10% and Barbaracle. Its great bulk also allows it to pivot into the likes of Lycanroc-D, Tyrantrum, and Metagross. Its pivoting capabilities are further enhanced by access to Regenerator, Leech Seed, and Synthesis, alongside several support moves like Knock Off and Sleep Powder, which allow Tangela to keep itself useful and be a huge annoyance during a match. However, despite having an unmatched pivoting potential, Tangela faces competition from many other Grass-type options, like Virizion, Shaymin, and Roserade, which offer different support options and pose greater threats due to better offensive stats and movepools. While having a pure Grass typing can help Tangela check opposing Water- and Electric-types, its abysmal Special Defense stat makes it hard to check the likes of Mega Blastoise, Milotic, and Raikou, which can deliver a powerful hit with coverage in Ice Beam and Signal Beam. The abundance of Poison- and Fire-types in the tier is also a great hindrance for Tangela's viability; Ninetales, Salazzle, Roserade, Drapion, and Toxicroak can take advantage of its general passivity to switch into it and fire off powerful moves. Tangela's pivoting capability is also severely hampered by Toxic, which is not a problem for other Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade that can mitigate status ailments with their access to Natural Cure or Poison typing. Likewise, entry hazards are very hurtful for Tangela, since they reduce Regenerator’s healing considerably when it enters the field. Knock Off is another major concern for Tangela, as it reduces its defensive stats considerably. Machamp, Donphan, and Tsareena are examples of Pokemon able to remove Tangela's Eviolite, which makes them harder to check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Synthesis can be an option to keep Tangela even healthier during a match. Tangela can run Toxic to cripple common roadblocks, such as Goodra, Mandibuzz, and Arcanine. Stun Spore can be used as a more spammable alternative to Sleep Powder, allowing Tangela to cripple multiple Pokemon during a match. Hidden Power Fire can be used as a way to heavily damage the likes of Escavalier and Mega Abomasnow as well as to hit the likes of Registeel for decent damage. Tangela can run Giga Drain or Grass Knot as its STAB move over Leaf Storm; Giga Drain is considerably weaker but allows Tangela to recover itself while doing damage, while Grass Knot has a more consistent damage output, despite being weaker against lighter Pokemon, such as Zygarde-10% and Bewear. An offensive EV spread of 84 HP / 252 SpA / 172 Spe and a Modest nature makes Tangela much less passive and enables it to outspeed Milotic while still being able to check most of the Pokemon it is supposed to.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Tangela's abysmal Special Defense, most special attackers can force it out. Mega Blastoise, Mega Ampharos, Raikou, Espeon, and Gardevoir are all able to get off a huge hit on Tangela with their STAB or coverage moves, but they have to be careful about Sleep Powder and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ninetales, Salazzle, Arcanine, and Houndoom can threaten Tangela with powerful Fire-type moves, though they dislike getting put to sleep or taking a Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tangela can do little to nothing against the likes of Mandibuzz, Mantine, and Noivern, while they can spread status or fire off super effective moves against it. While they aren't optimal switch-ins, Honchkrow and Swellow can also force out Tangela due to their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types can beat Tangela. Roserade, Mega Abomasnow, and Shaymin can beat Tangela due to their secondary STAB moves or Seed Flare's secondary effect and usually don't mind taking a Knock Off, though Hidden Power Flying can hit them for considerable damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Tangela usually relying on Regenerator as its only way of recovery, it can be easily worn down by residual damage. Poison, burn, and entry hazard damage can easily stop Tangela from recovering its health and checking what it is supposed to.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick Users</strong>: Machamp, Donphan, Tsareena, and Pangoro can remove Tangela's Eviolite with Knock Off, making them harder to check. On the other hand, Pokemon that run Choice items such as Gardevoir, Espeon, and Metagross can shut Tangela down with Trick, heavily limiting its utility.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Tangela's main STAB move that allows it to threaten Water- and Ground-types such as Mega Blastoise, Milotic, Gastrodon, and Donphan as well as deliver a huge hit against the likes of Zygarde-10%, Bewear, and Pangoro. Knock Off allows Tangela to remove many relevant items from its opposition, such as defensive Pokemon's Leftovers and offensive threats' Choice items. Leech Seed is very useful for Tangela alongside Knock Off to inflict chip damage on Steel- and Poison-types such as Registeel and Forretress while recovering back its health. Sleep Powder lets Tangela put many relevant threats to sleep that otherwise could be a menace, like Ninetales, Drapion, and Salazzle. Sludge Bomb rounds out Tangela's coverage against many other Grass-types such as Virizion, Mega Abomasnow, and Tsareena and is very useful due to its chance to poison foes. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice allows Tangela to threaten Noivern and doubles as a safer option to beat Zygarde-10%. However, it leaves Tangela more vulnerable against Virizion. Hidden Power Flying is an option that makes beating Synthesis Virizion way easier and leaves Tangela less vulnerable against the likes of Toxicroak and Emboar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite boosts Tangela's Defense to great levels while also making its Special Defense a little less bad. Regenerator allows Tangela to repeatedly switch into many threats with safety. 56 EVs in Special Defense and maximum HP investment allows Tangela to take Timid Mega Blastoise's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock, while 92 EVs in Special Attack enable Tangela to OHKO it back with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock. The rest is dumped into Defense to let Tangela check Zygarde-10% safely. Alternatively, an EV spread of 248 HP / 232 Def / 28 SpD makes Zygarde-10% unable to KO Tangela with Devastating Drake followed by Outrage after one Dragon Dance. The rest is dumped into its Special Defense to help take special hits more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Knock Off is Tangela's most useful tool and must be used constantly to remove items from its switch-ins and identify potential Z-Move users. Sleep Powder should be used against more threatening Pokemon on the switch, such as Salazzle, Honchkrow, and Noivern, to limit your opponent's options. Due to its access to Regenerator, Tangela can switch into dangerous physical attackers such as Choice Band Tyrantrum and Choice Band Metagross to scout their moves and make switching into them easier. Be aware of Pokemon that can run Toxic to cripple Tangela, such as Donphan and Choice Band Zygarde-10%. Tangela should not stay in on special attackers such as Gardevoir and Raikou because of its bad Special Defense stat. While Leaf Storm is a very powerful STAB move and should be used frequently, be careful about its Special Attack drop, since it can allow opposing Pokemon to set up way more easily against it, such as Virizion and even Zygarde-10%.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tangela can be used to form Fire / Water / Grass cores. Milotic, Slowbro, and Mantine can form defensive cores and offer utility alongside it, while Golisopod and Mega Blastoise offer powerful attacks and entry hazard options. These Water-types can also switch into Fire- and Ice-type moves for Tangela. On the other hand, Arcanine, Salazzle, Ninetales, and Houndoom complement the core's offensive presence and appreciate Tangela's ability to switch into Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type attacks. Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Tyrantrum, and Lycanroc-D greatly benefit from Tangela's ability to lure in Fire-, Flying- and Poison-types, which allows them to set up Stealth Rock or fire off powerful attacks. Steel-types like Registeel, Bronzong, Metagross, and Escavalier can switch into Ice-type moves that threaten Tangela and are also immune to Toxic. On the other hand, Tangela offers a useful Ground-type resistance and can pivot into many Fighting-types. Florges, Mantine, and Goodra can make Tangela's life easier against special attackers like Mega Blastoise, Ninetales, and Roserade. Additionally, Florges is able to offer cleric support to remove status from Tangela, and the former two can also remove hazards from the field.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Through a combination of Imposter and Choice Scarf, Ditto can turn the tables on a plethora of dangerous setup sweepers, like Barbaracle, Virizion, and Salazzle. Ditto functions well as an offense revenge killer, since after copying one of the opponent's powerful Pokemon, they will usually lack effective switch-ins to it, allowing Ditto to claim one or two KOs before it's forced out. In addition to this, Ditto's ability to refresh its PP indefinitely by switching in and out can be used to PP stall defensive teams, and it can also copy enemy moves as well as utility moves like Heal Bell or Defog for its team's benefit against such teams. However, Ditto does not copy the enemy's HP stat and therefore can only be switched in if predicting an attack that the target Pokemon resists, such as Salazzle's Sludge Bomb, as a pathetic base 48 HP often means it can be severely damaged or outright KOed without good prediction. Despite the move being rather uncommon in RU with the exception of Raikou, Imposter is blocked by Substitute, meaning Ditto can often fail to beat Substitute sweepers. Additionally, Ditto can struggle versus balance, as even if it copies something theoretically dangerous, the enemy team will usually have a sturdy defensive answer. The potential entry hazard stacking nature of these teams can also give Ditto trouble.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other Hidden Power types can be used instead to try to eliminate specific threats. Hidden Power Ice can be run in order to lure in and KO Noivern if copied off something like Ninetales, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to beat Roserade. However, these are very specific instances and are usually not worth giving up the Salazzle-beating property of Hidden Power Ground.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute blocks Imposter, making Ditto completely useless against setup threats that carry it, most notably Raikou.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon that can boost their defensive stats along with their offensive ones can use Ditto as setup fodder, like Espeon, Snorlax, Sigilyph, and Necrozma.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Due to holding a Choice Scarf itself, Ditto will end up forcing a Speed tie between itself and the foe. They can also switch in if they are faster than whatever Ditto has already transformed into.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal and Paralysis</strong>: Removal of Ditto’s Choice Scarf via Knock Off from common users of the move like Passimian, Mandibuzz, and Donphan prevents Ditto from doing its job, as it's reliant on its Choice Scarf to outspeed whatever it transforms into. Paralysis will also hinder this, preventing it from outspeeding any foe whatsoever.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Ditto hates having to take entry hazard damage as it switches in, with Toxic Spikes being especially detrimental to its longevity.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is Ditto's only move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf is chosen as the necessary item so Ditto doesn't have to rely on Speed ties to beat its chosen targets. If the opponent is also holding a Choice Scarf, it results in a Speed tie. The defensive investment helps in the rare Ditto mirror matchup by minimizing opposing Ditto's Struggle damage. Imposter gives Ditto its entire niche, allowing it to transform into the opposing Pokemon immediately upon switching in. The chosen IVs are used for Hidden Power Ground, helping Ditto revenge kill Salazzle. However, depending on the chosen target, IVs can be changed, like Hidden Power Fire for Roserade, but this relies on the opponent carrying Hidden Power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ditto's primary purpose is to revenge kill boosted setup sweepers like Salazzle, Virizion, and Ninetales. By far the safest way to use Ditto is to bring it in after a teammate falls and click the appropriate move for the situation. Bringing it in with slow pivots is also helpful, as Ditto only gets a maximum of five chances to come in if you restrict yourself to only switching it in after one of its teammates faints. Predicting a move that will be not very effective against whatever Ditto transforms into, like Virizion's Leaf Blade, is also a good way to get it in safely. Do not switch Ditto in on Pokemon whose STAB moves are neutral or super effective to themselves, as Ditto will easily be KOed if it tries thanks to its low HP. The opponent will most likely assume Ditto will always be locked into one move courtesy of Choice Scarf, so they may try to play around it by switching appropriately. It is advised to scout what possible moves your opponent may make and predict accordingly. Foes with too big of a difference in base HP, most notably Snorlax, are very difficult for Ditto to take on effectively. Against defensive teams, Ditto can infinitely copy foes' PP by switching in and out, therefore able to turn the tables by using their own Heal Bell, Defog, and Recover to benefit its own team and stall out the PP of opposing teams that rely on residual damage to win. Ditto can also be used for scouting purposes, able to check for surprise coverage moves such as Zen Headbutt on Virizion and Rock Slide on Passimian. Great care should be taken to keep Ditto away from Knock Off and Trick users, as Ditto loses most of its value if its Choice Scarf is removed. For instance, switching in on Passimian's Knock Off may seem appealing due to Passimian's Dark resistance, but Ditto should always attempt to keep its Choice Scarf as long as it can. Ditto should also be kept away from Toxic, as it massively cuts into its ability to switch in and do its job, in tandem with possibly taking entry hazard damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ditto fits well on balance and offense teams in need of a versatile revenge killer, notably ones carrying Fighting-types to deal with Snorlax and Bewear, both of which Ditto has difficulty beating. These teams also struggle with very bulky teams, so Ditto's ability to infinitely copy their utility moves is beneficial to helping its team beat those sorts of opposing Pokemon. Cleric support from the likes of Florges, Diancie, and Vaporeon is great for keeping Ditto's health up and keeping it free of status. Pokemon that are hard to break through without setup also make for good partners, such as Mandibuzz and Cresselia, due to Ditto's ability to punish setup. Entry hazard removal is also very good alongside Ditto, making sure it doesn't take any unnecessary damage. Donphan, Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, and Flygon can all take on the entry hazard-clearing role. Grounded Poison-types, like Nidoqueen and Roserade, can be used as well to clear the field of Toxic Spikes more easily. Pokemon that can switch in on Knock Off and Trick make good partners, namely Fighting-type Z-Crystal users that don't mind Knock Off, like Bewear, Toxicroak, and Virizion.</p>"

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vaporeon is insurance against one of the best Pokemon in the tier, Mega Blastoise, and access to Wish and Heal Bell makes it a decent pick for balance teams. Vaporeon's fantastic bulk lets it blanket check other special attackers like Salazzle, Ninetales, and Swellow. Wish + Protect is fantastic for supporting teammates, and Vaporeon's extremely high HP stat accentuates its prominence as a Wish user. However, Vaporeon is often outclassed as a bulky Water-type and Mega Blastoise switch-in by Mantine, which can blanket check a plethora of special attackers, provide Defog support, and match up well against most Grass-types, arguably one of the most threatening types in RarelyUsed. Vaporeon's passive nature will give free turns to the opponent frequently, something that can leave you in an awful spot in such a fast-paced metagame. For example, Vaporeon's over-reliance on Protect to effectively use Wish allows the opponent to easily double switch to wallbreakers and setup sweepers. Vaporeon lacking Ice Beam can't keep up with aggressive hazard stack teams carrying Roserade. Vaporeon's poor offensive presence gives plenty of setup opportunities to opposing Pokemon like Mega Abomasnow and Snorlax.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic lets Vaporeon cripple checks like Virizion, Mega Ampharos, and Mega Abomasnow on the switch. Roar helps Vaporeon's matchup against setup sweepers, removing them from the field and potentially racking up entry hazard damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Virizion and Roserade can take advantage of Vaporeon's presence to set up on it or set Spikes, respectively. Shaymin also beats Vaporeon one-on-one easily with its strong, super effective STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong attackers like Machamp, Choice Band Tyrantrum, and Bewear OHKO Vaporeon, but the latter two must respect Scald’s burn chance if they attempt to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Vaporeon's passive nature leaves it helpless against setup sweepers like Toxicroak, Raikou, and Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt Pokemon like Noivern and Mandibuzz effectively stop Vaporeon, preventing it from healing or providing Wish and cleric support.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Mega Ampharos and Raikou are able to 2HKO Vaporeon with their super effective STAB attacks and can also gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Vaporeon's main attack and has a good chance to burn. Wish lets Vaporeon have some recovery and heal teammates. Protect improves Wish's reliability and lets Vaporeon scout against Choice item users like Tyrantrum. Heal Bell lets Vaporeon act as a cleric, healing any status that has been inflicted on the team. Although Vaporeon is typically helpless against Pokemon like Toxicroak, Roserade, and Virizion, Ice Beam can help with this, damaging them all decently on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature make Vaporeon as specially bulky as possible, letting it avoid the 2HKO from Pokemon like Choice Specs Yanmega and Choice Specs Swellow after Stealth Rock and giving it as much insurance as possible against the biggest threat in the tier, Mega Blastoise. Leftovers gives it passive recovery. Water Absorb lets it heal when hit by Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Mantine and Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Support teammates, especially those lacking recovery, with Wish. Position Vaporeon against slow, passive Pokemon so as to seamlessly pass Wishes. Fish for burns with Scald as physical attackers like Virizion switch into you, as once they're burned they'll have next to no use. Use Protect to effectively heal Vaporeon with Wish, scout against potential Choice-locked attackers, hamper the power of Z-Moves, and take full advantage of Leftovers. Hit Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin on the switch with Ice Beam, and take advantage of them being forced to use Synthesis to get a free switch to a teammate. Try to avoid Knock Off, as once Vaporeon loses Leftovers, it'll be chipped very easily from weak attacks and Stealth Rock. Consequently, you'll have to focus more on healing Vaporeon with Wish as opposed to passing Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sturdy Steel-types like Stealth Rock Bronzong greatly appreciate Vaporeon's Wish support. If you opt for Ice Beam over Heal Bell, make sure to pair Vaporeon with teammates such as Guts Machamp that don't struggle with status users such as Registeel. Venusaur in particular is a fantastic partner, being able to take on Grass-types and Electric-types that Vaporeon can't deal with as well as cripple Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong with Knock Off. Fire-types like Ninetales and Arcanine appreciate Wish support to help with their Stealth Rock weakness, and they bust through Steel-types and Roserade in return. Vaporeon can take on Rock- and Ground-types for them as well.</p>"

Other very fast Pokemon such as Swellow, Ribombee, or Mega Sceptile also outclass it in its revenge killing and pivoting roles; the only unique thing it has that stands out is the ability to force switches with a combination of Yawn and Volt Switch; however, this niche is very hard to pull off and not appreciated by most teams.</p>",

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl sits in a phenomenal Speed tier that allows it to outpace popular offensive threats such as Swellow and Salazzle. In conjunction with its tremendous Speed stat, Aerodactyl's solid coverage options allow it to function as an effective revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Aerodactyl can trap and weaken problematic Pokemon for offensive teams such as Swellow, Espeon, and Salazzle with Pursuit, as these Pokemon will often switch out when faced with Aerodactyl, fearing a powerful Stone Edge or super effective Earthquake. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl's only decent Attack stat can make it difficult for it to break through bulkier walls such as Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Slowbro. In a similar vein, Aerodactyl's poor defensive stats and weakness to common Water-, Steel-, and Rock-type attacks make it somewhat of a defensive liability and, as such, harder to fit on various team archetypes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast is capable of 2HKOing Bewear and can snipe Forretress while dealing some chip to Bronzong. Aside from these targets, it is generally far less useful than Earthquake's utility, though. In a similar vein, Aqua Tail smacks Rhyperior and Donphan for huge damage, though the ability to hit Steel-types for super effective damage with Earthquake is usually superior. Aerodactyl can also make use of a Hone Claws set with Flyinium Z and Sky Attack, but this set is often unreliable and still struggles to break through Pokemon such as Bronzong, Metagross, and Rhyperior. Choice Band is an alternative option that boosts Aerodactyl's Attack stat further; however, the inability to use support moves such as Roost and Taunt can leave it far less useful to a team, while not being able to switch moves can leave Aerodactyl as setup bait for a threatening sweeper such as Zygarde-10% if not locked into Ice Fang or Klinklang when not locked into Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong, Metagross, and Forretress resist Aerodactyl's STAB combination and take little damage from Earthquake. In return, these Pokemon can use Aerodactyl as setup fodder or simply KO it with their super effective Steel-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Steelix resist Aerodactyl's STAB combination and take very little damage from Earthquake due to their high base Defense stats. These Pokemon can OHKO Aerodactyl with their respective STAB moves as well, making them particularly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Tyrantrum can outspeed Aerodactyl and heavily damage it or even OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks, making them solid offensive checks.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Powerful priority moves such as Honchkrow's Sucker Punch and Lycanroc-D's Accelerock bypass Aerodactyl's high Speed stat and do massive damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Milotic and Slowbro are capable of taking any attack Aerodactyl can throw at them and in return deal huge damage with a super effective STAB Water-type attack.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is a powerful Rock-type STAB move, nailing Noivern, Arcanine, and Mantine for super effective damage. It has rather lackluster accuracy, however. Earthquake has excellent synergy with Stone Edge, dealing super effective damage to Steel- and Rock-types like Metagross, Registeel, and Gigalith as they switch into Aerodactyl. Pursuit is very useful for trapping and weakening offensive threats usually forced out by Aerodactyl such as Swellow, Salazzle, and Noivern. Roost extends Aerodactyl's longevity throughout a battle, and lets it directly switch into some of the threats it's supposed to trap, like Noivern and Salazzle. Its lackluster bulk can make finding opportunities to Roost safely somewhat hard, however. Taunt can be used in order to shut down bulky walls that bother Aerodactyl such as Registeel and Cresselia. Ice Fang is an option that ensures Aerodactyl can revenge kill Zygarde-10% from full, while also nailing Flygon and Virizion. However, Ice Fang is quite weak against anything else, and Zygarde-10% in particular takes considerable damage from Earthquake. Lastly, Crunch is useful for hitting Bronzong, one of the most reliable counters to Aerodactyl, for super effective damage, while hitting Psychic-types such as Uxie, Slowbro, and Cresselia for slightly more damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Aerodactyl to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed Pokemon such as Swellow and Salazzle. Unnerve is the ability of choice in order to bypass Berries from the likes of Shuca Berry Metagross, Colbur Berry Mismagius, Sitrus Berry Slurpuff, and Colbur Berry Uxie. Life Orb is the selected item, boosting Aerodactyl's damage output while still allowing it to switch up moves and take advantage of its impressive coverage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aerodactyl sports very low defenses, so avoid directly switching it into attacks, as even powerful resisted attacks will do significant damage. Keeping Aerodactyl healthy until the later stages of a game is often optimal, as it serves as an excellent late-game cleaner once its checks and counters have been appropriately weakened or removed entirely. Make use of Volt Switch or U-turn and well-timed double switches to get Aerodactyl in as often as possible to pressure the opposing team. Aerodactyl makes for a decent offensive check to Pokemon such as Swellow, Salazzle, and Yanmega, so these Pokemon will often switch out when facing Aerodactyl. In this case, using Pursuit to weaken or potentially KO these Pokemon is often advisable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aerodactyl greatly appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Forretress and Roserade, as these hazards chip away at bulkier walls for Aerodactyl to eventually clean up late-game. Similarly, Aerodactyl does not appreciate coming into the field repeatedly with Stealth Rock up, so hazard removal support from Pokemon such as Mantine, Dhelmise, and Donphan works well with Aerodactyl. Powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Swellow and Choice Band Escavalier are excellent partners for Aerodactyl, as they can break through bulkier walls for Aerodactyl to sweep late-game. Bulky Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Metagross are bothersome for Aerodactyl, so Pokemon that can combat them such as Virizion and Milotic make for solid teammates. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Raikou and Flygon pair well with Aerodactyl, as they can provide it with free switches in as well as chip away at bulkier Pokemon with their VoltTurn attacks. Shaymin also works very well with Aerodactyl, as it greatly appreciates Aerodactyl's prowess in trapping Pokemon such as Swellow and Salazzle, and also can switch into Scald with impunity.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>As Snorlax continues to descend into lower tiers, it brings with it its tried-and-true Curse sets and manages to establish its perpetual dominance in the SM RU metagame as evident by its influential and consistent roles as a setup sweeper, wallbreaker, and defensive threat. Snorlax's Thick Fat ability in conjunction with its defensive stats allows it to check a variety of Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, Salazzle, and Mega Glalie, while its ability to make use of Curse further bolsters its defensive prowess and enables it to sweep. Figy Berry opens up the option for a different spin on its conventional Curse set, making use of it with Gluttony and Recycle to give Snorlax a tool that capitalizes on its matchup versus offensive teams. Along with three great abilities, Snorlax possesses a movepool that complements its job as a wallbreaker and defensive Pokemon, granting it access to Pursuit, which can dispose of frail attackers like Swellow, Mismagius, and Espeon, alongside the necessary coverage moves and STAB attacks to break through physically bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Metagross. Snorlax, however, is forced to rely either on Rest, which oftentimes puts in situations where it has to compromise its team's momentum to stay in the game, or Recycle + Figy Berry, which makes it susceptible to status; its relatively low Speed means it will often be too offensively pressured to rely on these recovery options. Sets not using any form of recovery will usually be overwhelmed quickly, and Snorlax has a number of counters that can hold back its sweeper and Choice Band sets, requiring its teammates to provide additional support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Belly Drum can be used on the Gluttony set for an immediate boost in power and wallbreaking potential, allowing Snorlax to function as a ferocious wallbreaker at the cost of its longevity. Likewise, offensive Curse sets with or without ChestoRest can be used to overpower walls at a faster rate while still having the bulk to last versus offensive threats. Assault Vest can be used if your team is particularly vulnerable to the special attackers that Snorlax checks; however, the set lacks quite a bit of power and is easy to wear down due to its lack of recovery. Snorlax can also try to employ a similar offensive set but with the use of Protect + Leftovers to last longer throughout the match. Whirlwind can be used on more defensive sets to hold off setup sweepers such as Salazzle. Normalium Z is an option on the standard Curse set to cushion Knock Off damage, allow Snorlax to break through Encore, give it a one-time boost in power, and make it immune to Trick, but it comes at the cost of Leftovers recovery, which is usually more valuable for a slow setup sweeper. Lastly, the vast majority of Snorlax's counters are susceptible to Toxic, so Snorlax can employ the move on its standard Curse set so that it won't need as much support to sweep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Alolan Marowak, Palossand, and Mismagius are capable of stopping most variants of Curse Snorlax; however, Choice Band Snorlax and Recycle Snorlax with the right coverage can easily beat them.</p> <p><strong>Strong Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Choice Band Pangoro, Choice Band Tyrantrum, and Swords Dance Virizion can apply a significant amount of pressure on Snorlax and outright KO it in some cases. Escavalier and Tyrantrum in particular are capable of switching into Snorlax's Normal-type STAB attacks with ease.</p> <p><strong>Haze</strong>: Milotic can hold off Curse sets with Haze and even stomach any hit aside from Self-Destruct from Choice Band Snorlax. It can alternate between Haze and Recover to hold off Snorlax throughout the majority of the match, making it a very reliable check.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Taunt and Setup Pokemon</strong>: Taunt Mismagius and Swords Dance Escavalier can either stop Snorlax from setting up with Taunt or just proceed to overpower it altogether.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard CurseLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse allows Snorlax to boost its stats and overpower a slew of physical attackers, such as Flygon and Honchkrow. Body Slam is used to inflict paralysis on targets, making it easier for Snorlax to rack up boosts on them. Frustration is a more powerful alternative; the power comes in handy for 2HKOing Slowbro at +3, which Body Slam fails to do. Frustration also doesn't inflict status where it sometimes isn't wanted, such as on Unaware or Haze users that are better off poisoned. Rest keeps Snorlax healthy while setting up and allows it to heal crippling status. Earthquake provides Snorlax with additional coverage to target Ghost- and Steel-types such as Palossand, Metagross, and Alolan Marowak. Earthquake also has the benefit of OHKOing Salazzle with no boosts. Sleep Talk allows Snorlax to boost as it sleeps in exchange for greater coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Snorlax's overall bulk and allow it to overpower physical attackers such as Honchkrow after a single boost. The Defense EVs in particular are useful for avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gardevoir's Psyshock. The Special Defense investment allows Snorlax to better check the likes of Nidoqueen, Florges, and Ninetales. Thick Fat is the most useful ability on a set that uses Rest, and it allows Snorlax to check or set up on various Fire- and Ice-types such as Vanilluxe, Salazzle, and Mega Glalie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Snorlax is incapable of sweeping very well in the early-game, it can still be useful by switching in on a wide variety of special attackers such as Florges, Gardevoir, Salazzle, and Roserade to check them. Caution is advised when switching in on some of these special attackers, though, as they can give Snorlax a Choice item with Trick to make it nearly useless. Snorlax can also be brought in to absorb status from the likes of Slowbro and Cresselia. In other words, Snorlax can be used as a bulky pivot until it can find the right time to set up Curse. When using Curse, be sure that Pokemon such as Alolan Marowak are at least a little weakened beforehand. This can be done by anticipating a switch and hitting it with Earthquake prior to setting up. Should a strong physical attacker such as Honchkrow or Choice Scarf Tyrantrum come in on Snorlax as it uses Curse, it's best to use Curse one more time before going for Rest, as that will make it easier for Snorlax to sustain the damage from their following attacks as it's asleep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Florges, Vaporeon, and Umbreon are imperative if one uses Snorlax without Sleep Talk; Florges can even stomach Fighting-type attacks. Many of Snorlax's checks are susceptible to Spikes, so Forretress can make a good partner for its ability to set Spikes and wear down Snorlax's checks with residual damage. Knock Off support from the likes of Tangela and Tsareena can wear down some of the Pokemon meant to check Snorlax, making it easier for Snorlax to beat them over time. Toxic Spikes support from Dragalge or Nidoqueen can be extremely useful in putting a stop to Unaware users, certain Ghost-types, and Haze Milotic, while Snorlax can check various special attackers such as Gardevoir and physical attackers like Mega Glalie that the two struggle with.</p>"
      },
      "Recycle CurseLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse allows Snorlax to boost its stats and overpower various physical attackers such as Honchkrow. Recycle is imperative to this set's function, as it allows Snorlax to continually make use of its Figy Berry to act as a pseudo-Recover. Facade is used, as this Snorlax has no way to alleviate status ailments itself without deteriorating the effectiveness of the set with suboptimal moves. In particular, Facade encourages Snorlax to get burned so that Facade doubles in power and Snorlax cannot be affected by more crippling status such as poison. In the last slot, Earthquake targets the greatest number of Normal-resistant Pokemon, such as Gigalith and Metagross, while Fire Punch alongside Facade has no immunities, allowing Snorlax to muscle past most Pokemon and avoid being overpowered by Swords Dance Escavalier and walled by Mismagius and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gluttony in conjunction with Figy Berry allows Snorlax to recover its health by half of its maximum HP when at or under 50% health. The EVs' focus on bulk best takes advantage of this set's greatest qualities by making Snorlax a resilient setup sweeper. A more offensive EV spread with an Adamant nature can be used to break through defensive cores more quickly and allow Snorlax to pose as an immediate offensive threat, but the bulk in conjunction with the instant recovery is what helps make the set so hard to take down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring this Snorlax in on special attackers that can't threaten it like Florges and Nidoqueen and begin setting up. It's usually best to use Recycle right after Snorlax consumes its Figy Berry so that Snorlax can have a safety net in case it's forced out or sustains a critical hit during setup. Avoid taking Knock Offs from Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, as a Figy Berry lost that way cannot be restored. When up against defensive teams, try to get Snorlax burned instead of poisoned: it's a far more manageable status condition because of Facade and the minimal residual damage, whereas Toxic will prevent it from sweeping altogether due to the added damage each passing turn. This Snorlax can be used to check certain special attackers such as Gardevoir and Mismagius; however, be cautious of Trick and do note that it's a bit shakier against certain offensive threats without Thick Fat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish and Lunar Dance users such as Shaymin, Cresselia, and Gardevoir make excellent partners, as they can help bring Snorlax back to tip-top shape should it accidentally take a Toxic. Shaymin can also sponge Toxic and deal with Unaware users, while Gardevoir and Cresselia can check Fighting-types. Nidoqueen also makes for a good partner, as it checks various Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and provides Snorlax with Stealth Rock support; it can also punish Pokemon that Snorlax lures like Bronzong with Fire Blast and Toxic users such as Milotic with Thunderbolt. Pokemon that share similar checks in Unaware users or physical walls carrying Toxic, such as Escavalier and Choice Band Tyrantrum, can make for good partners by softening up Snorlax's checks or Pursuit trapping some of them in the case of Escavalier.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Snorlax's best STAB attack because it provides some crucial KOs, such as a 2HKO on Slowbro, specially defensive Cresselia, and an OHKO on Shaymin after Stealth Rock damage. Frustration, however, can be used at the cost of the greater power in order to not induce recoil and compromise Snorlax's bulk. Earthquake allows Snorlax to destroy conventional Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Metagross, Gigalith, Diancie, and Registeel. Pursuit allows Snorlax to trap many Pokemon it's capable of checking or forcing out, such as Swellow, Mismagius, Cryogonal, Nidoqueen, Yanmega, and Salazzle. In the last slot, Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to lure and OHKO physical walls such as Pyukumuku and Slowbro to pave the way for another sweeper. Fire Punch can be used to OHKO Escavalier, 2HKO Bronzong, and has a chance to OHKO Forretress from full. Facade can be used to make Snorlax a scald absorber and hits harder than Double-Edge without the recoil. However, it is very reliant on getting hit by status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Snorlax to outspeed Bronzong so that it doesn't have to sustain unnecessary damage when 2HKOing it as a result of being slower. The Speed is also useful to outspeed base 30 Speed Pokemon such as Slowbro for similar reasons. The defensive EVs are poured into Special Defense to maximize Snorlax's bulk, allowing it to withstand two of Swellow's Boombursts and two of Nidoqueen's Earth Powers after Stealth Rock. Immunity is the ability of choice, as it's useful for switching into defensive Pokemon such as Bronzong, Cresselia, Pyukumuku, and Registeel without much risk, making Snorlax better in matchups versus defensive teams but shakier in matchups against offensive teams due to the lack of Thick Fat making it harder for Snorlax to switch into Pokemon such as Mega Glalie; however, outside of Mega Glalie, Ninetales, and Vanilluxe, there aren't many notable threats that an offensive Snorlax would need Thick Fat for.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Snorlax can be brought in on weaker special attackers such as Mismagius, Yanmega, and Espeon. It can also check stronger special attackers such as Swellow and Nidoqueen. When using Immunity, Snorlax can easily switch in on many walls such as Pyukumuku, Cresselia, Registeel, and Bronzong. Snorlax can also Pursuit trap some of those it switches in on, as Bronzong, Espeon, Mismagius, and Swellow in particular are unlikely to stay in on Snorlax if they can help it. However, be cautious of using Pursuit when setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Flygon are present, as they can easily exploit a Choice-locked Snorlax. Versus slower setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Slowbro, Snorlax should be brought in as soon as possible, as it can put a stop to them with Self-Destruct or 2HKO them with Double-Edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish support from Gardevoir or Shaymin allows Snorlax to last a lot longer and mitigates its lack of recovery. Shaymin can also provide a cushion for Scald burns, while Gardevoir can check Fighting-types. Snorlax pairs particularly well with Gardevoir by Pursuit trapping, luring, or wearing down many of its checks such as Bronzong, Metagross, and Cresselia. Nidoqueen works well with Snorlax by checking Fighting- and Steel-types and providing Stealth Rock support, while Snorlax can Pursuit trap or weaken many of Nidoqueen's checks.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articuno is an excellent support Pokemon on stall and balance teams due to its access to the rare Pressure, which allows it to keep Stealth Rock off the field against passive users of the move, such as Registeel and Palossand, while its great defensive stats let it act as a blanket check to various offensive entry hazard setters like Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Golisopod. Articuno is also excellent at stalling out common defensive cores due to its ability to avoid status through Heal Bell or Substitute and burn through the foe's PP.  Articuno's ability to break common cores can allow it to support more offensive teammates and helps mitigate its issues with passivity. However, Articuno's weak defensive typing makes it particularly vulnerable to Stealth Rock; entry hazard setters that can exploit its weaknesses heavily limit its effectiveness throughout the match. This makes it a particularly matchup-dependent Pokemon. On one hand, it can easily dominate matches where the opponent relies on passive setters like Bronzong; however, it can be a dead slot on teams that use Pokemon such as Metagross and Diancie to set up Stealth Rock. Finally, while Articuno has an amazing matchup against passive teams, it struggles to take on more offensive builds, where Pokemon like Salazzle and Raikou can take advantage of its weak damage output.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hurricane can be used as Articuno's STAB move, letting it nail Fighting-types such as Virizion, Hariyama, and Passimian as well as hit neutral targets harder, including Fire-types like Salazzle, although the coverage and PP provided by Freeze-Dry are otherwise far superior. Haze can let Articuno act as a pseudo-Unaware Pokemon on stall teams, although it has trouble fitting it on its moveset. This move, however, notably allows Articuno to prevent Stealth Rock from Calm Mind Necrozma.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Steel-types</strong>: Metagross's ubiquity in the tier and ability to easily scare out Articuno mean that it will always be able to set up Stealth Rock on its face. Less commonly, Pokemon such as Klinklang and Escavalier can also force Articuno out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Pokemon like Tyrantrum and Lycanroc can get free turns off Articuno and force it out. Diancie, Gigalith, and Rhyperior can set up Stealth Rock on Articuno, although they must be wary of Substitute variants.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Articuno invites Fire-types such as Ninetales and Salazzle, which are a huge pain for the bulky teams it is usually found on.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Raikou, Necrozma, and Virizion can take advantage of Articuno's passivity and set up on its face.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is Articuno's main niche and allows it to neuter Pokemon such as Registeel and Bronzong, rendering them useless and unable to fulfill their main purpose on teams. Freeze-Dry is a reliable STAB move that lets Articuno beat Water-types like Blastoise easily. Its high PP should also be noted, as it allows Articuno to PP stall its targets more easily. Heal Bell lets Articuno act as a cleric for its team as well as beat passive Pokemon that rely on Toxic for damage, such as Registeel or Cresselia. This move is particularly useful on stall teams, where Articuno cannot afford to be statused on the switch. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to help Articuno PP stall moves such as Stone Edge from Rhyperior and Power Gem from Diancie, as well as avoid status, although it makes Articuno more vulnerable to being statused on the switch. Substitute notably allows it to potentially stall through defensive cores.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread lets Articuno outspeed Choice Band Tyrantrum and Taunt + Toxic Mandibuzz, both common nuisances against bulkier teams, while the remaining EVs are poured into HP and Special Defense to help Articuno wall threats such as Mega Blastoise and Roserade. Slower and bulkier spreads are also viable. Some relevant Speed benchmarks include Adamant Tyrantrum and Modest Nidoqueen. Pressure immensely aids Articuno in PP stalling several moves such as Toxic and Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's important to have the field clear of entry hazards before sending Articuno out. If the opponent's entry hazard setters are walled by Articuno, hard switch it into them to prevent having to take Stealth Rock damage and use Defog to remove them afterwards. Heal Bell variants have a lot more leeway against Toxic users like Registeel; with Pressure, it has enough PP to stall out a single Pokemon's Toxic. If running Substitute, try to predict whether the opponent will try to use Toxic against Articuno as it switches in, as it is heavily crippled if statused. Preserve Heal Bell's PP as much as possible; for example, switch to a Steel-type on a predicted Toxic. While Articuno can beat a single Toxic user one-on-one, multiple users of the move can overwhelm Articuno teams with little trouble. If Stealth Rock has been set up on the field already, avoid using Articuno to remove it unless absolutely necessary. Try to use Articuno's teammates first, or position your team to force the opponent to use Defog themselves. Pressure can be used to stall through a specific threat, but Articuno can also be switched into moves throughout the match to slowly stall out their PP, especially against moves such as Defog, Toxic, and Scald.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Articuno is a good choice on bulky teams like stall and balance. As such, Pokemon commonly found in these archetypes generally work well with it; staples like Milotic, Registeel, and Mandibuzz, for example, synergize well with Articuno. While Articuno is an excellent Defogger, it won't be consistent if it is the sole entry hazard remover in a team due to the existence of Pokemon like Rhyperior and Metagross. Other removers like Mandibuzz and Donphan can keep entry hazards off the field against these Pokemon. Articuno is setup bait for many dangerous offensive Pokemon, so bulky teammates like Donphan, Bronzong, and Pyukumuku can help mitigate its weak offense matchup. Fire-type switch-ins, like Gigalith and Goodra, can check Pokemon such as Salazzle and Ninetales that can set up on Articuno. In return, Articuno can help whittle down walls for them to wallbreak later on. Cleaners like Mega Sceptile and Ditto appreciate Articuno's ability to shut down defensive answers like Registeel and can help pressure the opponent more offensively.</p>"

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Magic Bounce lets Xatu block entry hazards from defensive Stealth Rock users, mainly the omnipresent Registeel as well as Bronzong. While Xatu struggles to switch directly into offensive hazard setters like Metagross and Roserade due to mediocre bulk, it still beats them one-on-one and forces prediction with the threat of Magic Bounce. Xatu's fantastic movepool also gives it the option to further support its team with U-turn or pose a massive threat to passive teams with Calm Mind in its last moveslot. However, Xatu is very matchup reliant. It fails to consistently beat offensive hazard setters, and its mediocre stats and defensive typing prevent it from threatening offensive teams with Calm Mind, meaning it'll only truly excel against balance teams with Registeel or Bronzong as their Stealth Rock user or against passive defensive teams lacking an Unaware user when running Calm Mind. Xatu is exploitable as well; many common Pokemon such as Zygarde-10%, Ninetales, Barbaracle, and Houndoom set up on it for free, and Pursuit users like Sneasel and Drapion can remove it, making it much easier for the opponent to set up Stealth Rock. It also has competition with Espeon, which offers a much more formidable offensive presence, and with other Defog users. For example, Defog Magic Guard Sigilyph beats Registeel and Bronzong lacking Gyro Ball nearly as well as Xatu while having better stats all around, and other Defog users such as Mandibuzz trade the ability to excel against Registeel for a much more impressive defensive presence and typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Night Shade lets Xatu deal consistent damage to defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Bronzong, but U-turn and Calm Mind are generally much more useful. Air Slash can be used on stall teams to deal with Pangoro, force out Golisopod, 2HKO Araquanid with Stealth Rock up, and do more damage against Bewear and Virizion. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Slowbro.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Houndoom, Sneasel, Drapion, Honchkrow, and Mandibuzz all pose massive threats to Xatu. Houndoom sets up on it for free thanks to Flash Fire; Sneasel, Drapion, and Honchkrow can all remove it with Pursuit; and Mandibuzz soaks up all of its attacks easily and beats it one-on-one with Foul Play or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Diancie and Rhyperior are very effective at beating Xatu: their super effective STAB moves make it difficult for Xatu to come in, meaning that they can set up Stealth Rock pretty freely. Lycanroc-D can set up Swords Dance on Xatu and proceed to demolish entire teams, and other Rock-types like Choice Scarf Tyrantrum easily remove Xatu.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Xatu's mediocre offensive stats make it difficult to prevent setup from Pokemon such as Zygarde-10%, Houndoom, and Barbaracle. Weakness Policy Metagross takes advantage of Xatu as well, soaking up Heat Wave to boost its offensive stats while setting up Agility.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Xatu's mediocre bulk leaves it struggling against wallbreakers like Mega Blastoise, Tyrantrum, Choice Band Metagross, and Arcanine. For example, it has to set up Calm Mind at least three times to be safe against Mega Blastoise, and physical wallbreakers have no trouble taking it out.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heat Wave is important for hitting Steel-types like Metagross and Escavalier that would otherwise wall Xatu. It's especially helpful for chipping defensive ones like Registeel and Bronzong, as the main reason to run Xatu is to block Stealth Rock from them. U-turn lets Xatu generate momentum, pivoting out of switch-ins such as Mandibuzz, Florges, and Milotic and bringing in wallbreakers. Calm Mind lets Xatu function as a wincon against passive defensive teams, as Magic Bounce lets it circumvent the typical counterplay, notably Toxic and phazing moves such as Whirlwind, that these teams run. Psyshock is used over Psychic to hit Pokemon such as Roserade and Virizion much harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs are used to outpace Stealth Rock Metagross. Rocky Helmet lets Xatu more effectively block Stealth Rock from defensive users like Registeel and improves its chances against offensive Stealth Rock users such as Metagross. Magic Bounce is extremely important, as without it Xatu can't bounce back hazards and status moves from Pokemon such as Registeel. A Timid nature in conjunction with 216 Speed EVs allows Xatu to outpace every entry hazard setter up through Roserade. 148 EVs from Defense and then HP can be moved over to Special Attack to allow Xatu to OHKO Roserade, but Roserade faints to uninvested Psyshock after a round of Life Orb or some chip damage as is, so it's situational.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Xatu to block Stealth Rock from Registeel and Bronzong, and keep in mind that if Stealth Rock Metagross is chipped a bit, you can switch in and wear it down with Rocky Helmet while recovering health with Roost until Xatu can remove it with Heat Wave. Xatu can also switch into Roserade lacking Poisonium Z unless chipped, so capitalize on that to block its Spikes. Calm Mind shouldn't be revealed until checks such as Mega Ampharos and Honchkrow are either chipped into range of Xatu's boosted attacks or removed completely. This is because if you reveal Calm Mind, they'll be played much more carefully, making it much harder to make full use of it. Use U-turn to pivot out of walls like Mandibuzz and Milotic that Xatu struggles with and bring in a threatening wallbreaker to deal with them. Take advantage of Xatu's useful defensive typing to switch in and check common threats such as Virizion lacking Stone Edge. Use Roost liberally, as Xatu's mediocre bulk makes it very difficult to switch into offensive entry hazard setters when chipped.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards, notably Houndoom, Golisopod, and Swellow, appreciate Xatu's ability to keep them off the field thanks to Magic Bounce and as such make great teammates. Wallbreakers like Ninetales, Flame Orb Machamp, and Roserade appreciate Xatu's U-turn support giving them free turns, as their lackluster bulk makes it difficult to come in otherwise. With their typings and good offensive presence, they support Calm Mind Xatu pretty well, being able to chip its checks and counters. Defensive teammates such as Porygon2 can work in the same way, slowly wearing at the opposition until Xatu can effectively set up Calm Mind. Pokemon like Gardevoir, Shaymin, Florges, and Diancie that struggle greatly with defensive Steel-types appreciate Xatu's ability to completely beat Registeel and Bronzong.</p>"

  "Espeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Espeon is a wallbreaker capable of punching holes into most balance builds, boasting great power when running Calm Mind or Choice Specs to overcome checks such as Bronzong and Mandibuzz. Nice coverage, a good Speed tier, a high Special Attack stat, and access to recovery in Morning Sun are some of the traits Espeon has to offer. Without a doubt, though, the flashiest aspect of Espeon comes from its ability Magic Bounce, which sends back any status moves and hazards to its user. However, Espeon's high Speed and Special Attack are obfuscated by its mediocre bulk, being only able to take very few special hits. Morning Sun also is a move with abysmal PP, which can be detrimental when Espeon attempts to set up. Despite having good ways to deal with Ghost- and Dark-types, it is still frail and very susceptible to Pursuit trapping. Due to not being able to switch into a lot of hits, Espeon usually needs pivoting to work properly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can turn Espeon into a revenge killer to setup sweepers like Barbaracle, Salazzle, and Mega Sceptile. Espeon can run a slower and bulkier Calm Mind set with a spread of 120 HP / 136 SpD / 252 Spe and a Timid nature, which allows it to set up on the likes of Registeel and Ninetales. However, this set lacks the immediate power Espeon has after one Calm Mind boost, and it's more geared towards beating bulkier teams without a Haze or Unaware user.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong can take at least one super effective hit and retaliate with Gyro Ball. Metagross and Escavalier can set up on Espeon when it lacks Hidden Power Fire and threaten it with their STAB attacks or Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Umbreon can take virtually anything from Espeon and stall it out with Wish and Foul Play. Mandibuzz can usually take a hit and U-turn out to a faster threat or deal huge damage with Knock Off or Foul Play. Choice Scarf Drapion and Sneasel can Pursuit trap Espeon or take it out with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Porygon2, Florges, Snorlax, Cresselia, and Registeel can deal with most hits from Choice Specs Espeon and proceed to beat it due to their resistances or recovery moves. However, they must be wary of Trick, as it may render them useless.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: The likes of Swellow, Noivern, Salazzle, Zygarde-10%, and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum can outspeed Espeon and take it down with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Golisopod and Honchkrow can revenge kill Espeon from full with First Impression and Sucker Punch. After some chip damage, Toxicroak and Choice Band Zygarde-10% can do the same.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Espeon's Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels against the likes of Florges, Roserade, and Dragalge, allowing it to take special neutral hits more easily and hit a lot harder. Psychic is Espeon's hardest-hitting STAB move, but Psyshock can be used to deal with the likes of Snorlax and other Pokemon with high Special Defense. Shadow Ball is the main coverage move on this set and allows Espeon to hit Bronzong, Metagross, and Cresselia super effectively. It also lets Espeon hit Steelix and Registeel neutrally. Morning Sun allows Espeon to stay healthy and keep setting up against the likes of Bronzong and Registeel. Alternatively, Zap Cannon is an one-time nuke when paired with Electrium Z that allows Espeon to break through some of its checks, outright OHKOing most Mandibuzz variants after Stealth Rock. It also offers good neutral coverage despite its shaky accuracy of 50%, allowing Espeon to blow up Water-types like Milotic and Mega Blastoise, deal with Pursuit trappers such as Drapion, and hit Registeel harder than Shadow Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature allows Espeon to hit hard and reach a great Speed tier, outspeeding the likes of Virizion, Ninetales, and Shaymin. Magic Bounce makes Espeon immune to Taunt and other status moves, allowing it to set up comfortably. Leftovers give Espeon some longevity to set up and recover off entry hazard damage. Electrium Z is essential if running Zap Cannon so Espeon is able to use Gigavolt Havoc. Colbur Berry can also be run to make Espeon less vulnerable against Knock Off and Pursuit users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Magic Bounce to your benefit by switching into possible status moves, such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, and into passive hazard users, such as Bronzong and Registeel, to reflect entry hazards and get setup opportunities. Make use of forced switches to use Calm Mind and deal with whatever comes in. After a Calm Mind boost, Espeon can even deal with the likes of Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Salazzle much more easily. When running Electrium Z, you can bluff Choice Specs and make switch-ins feel comfortable by taking a resisted or ineffective Psychic, just to start setting up or hit them with a super effective move. Note that not all Pursuit trappers can deal with Espeon; Drapion, Escavalier, and Metagross can all be dealt with via Gigavolt Havoc after some residual damage or a boost. However, faster Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel and Choice Scarf Drapion may stop Espeon dead in its tracks. Snorlax is the only Pursuit trapper that can always KO Espeon due to its great Special Defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Espeon appreciates Pokemon that can take on Dark-types, especially Umbreon, as partners. Bewear, Florges, Virizion, and Machamp are great teammates that can take them on. Fairy-types such as Florges resist Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can give Wish support or set up on them. The likes of Sigilyph and Necrozma can form Calm Mind cores alongside Espeon to overcome each other's checks. Pursuit trapping is nice to take Metagross and Bronzong out of the way for Espeon. Drapion, Sneasel, and Escavalier can take them out and offer offensive presence or nice resistances. Pokemon with Knock Off are good partners to Espeon, since they can remove the passive recovery of Leftovers from the likes of Registeel, Forretress, and Diancie. Mandibuzz and Escavalier can provide this support as well as a good defensive presence. Offensive partners that can deal with Pokemon that resist Espeon's attacks such as Registeel and Steelix are good choices alongside Espeon. The likes of Mega Blastoise and Ninetales can take out those defensive Pokemon, while Espeon can break through Pokemon that resist their attacks such as Milotic, Noivern, and Rhyperior.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is Espeon's main coverage move, enabling it to 2HKO Pokemon that resist Psychic such as Metagross, Cresselia, and Bronzong. Dazzling Gleam allows Espeon to 2HKO most Mandibuzz variants and take out the likes of Drapion and Pangoro and has a little chance of 2HKOing Umbreon. Trick allows Espeon to render defensive switch-ins like Umbreon, Registeel, and Bronzong almost useless, as they will be locked into one move. Hidden Power Fire allows Espeon to 2HKO Escavalier and damage other Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment into Special Attack and Speed with Choice Specs is necessary to maximize Espeon's capabilities as a wallbreaker and give it immediate power. Magic Bounce protects Espeon from Thunder Wave's paralysis.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure Espeon will get in safely, be it with smart switching into status moves or with pivoting. Although Magic Bounce allows Espeon to bounce back entry hazards, you must measure very well when it's time to switch in, since Espeon can be wrecked by moves such as Bronzong's Gyro Ball. Choose wisely what move Espeon will get locked into; opposing Pokemon can take advantage of a Choice-locked Espeon, especially the likes of Escavalier, Snorlax, and Drapion, which can Pursuit trap it when it's locked into Psychic. Trick is a powerful tool that allows Espeon to limit the utility of many defensive switch-ins, so try to Trick Espeon's Choice Specs onto Pokemon like Bronzong, Registeel, and Cresselia.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivoting from Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Mega Ampharos pairs well with Espeon to bring it safely into the field. Gardevoir is a very nice pick alongside Espeon, and when equipped with a Choice Scarf, its cleaning potential becomes way greater after Espeon's wallbreaking job has been done. Roserade, Golisopod, and Mega Glalie all can support Espeon with Spikes, which makes most rolls positive for Espeon, while also packing a huge punch. Drapion, Escavalier, and Sneasel are good teammates that can remove Steel-types' items with Knock Off and Pursuit trap Pokemon that resist Espeon's attacks such as Bronzong. After Espeon gets trapped by the likes of Drapion and Sneasel, Pokemon such as Barbaracle, Zygarde-10%, and Salazzle can capitalize on their Choice-locked move to set up and sweep right after.</p>"

Furthermore, its access to Foul Play can be a detriment to the physical attackers that try to come in and use Umbreon for setup, so Pokemon like Tyrantrum and Escavalier have to be careful about taking STAB Foul Play, as it can 2HKO them. That being said, Pokemon like Swords Dance Bewear, Calm Mind Florges, and Curse Snorlax take very little from it and can use Umbreon as setup fodder. In addition, its weakness to Fighting is bothersome with Virizion and Pangoro being very threatening to Umbreon and defensive teams in general.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moonlight on the cleric set instead of Protect is an option to not have Umbreon waste two turns by using Wish + Protect and instead just heal up. Taunt + Moonlight alongside Toxic can allow Umbreon to check and beat a number of Pokemon like Cresselia, Curse Snorlax, Slowbro, Milotic, and Porygon2. Screech is an option on the cleric set instead of Heal Bell to let it reliably beat Slowbro and Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Bewear, Toxicroak, Machamp, and Pangoro all don't take that much damage from Foul Play and can KO Umbreon with their STAB Fighting-type moves. Virizion has Justified to get an Attack boost from Foul Play and can set up with Swords Dance and KO Umbreon with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Yanmega, Galvantula, Araquanid, Golisopod, and Escavalier all have super effective STAB attacks that can KO Umbreon, but the last two have to be wary of Foul Play, as it can do a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Gardevoir packs a super effective Moonblast that can 2HKO Umbreon, but keep in mind that without Choice Specs or Life Orb, it only has a 7.4% chance to 2HKO. Florges with Calm Mind can also set up on Umbreon, but its Moonblast is very weak without boosts and fails to 2HKO specially defensive Umbreon. The same applies for Diancie.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleric": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish is the biggest reason to use Umbreon, as it lets it heal itself and teammates that need it, along with Protect, which guarantees that Umbreon gets recovery from Wish alongside passive recovery from Leftovers, gives the enemy an extra round of Toxic damage if they're poisoned, and scouts for moves and Choice-locked Pokemon. Heal Bell is a good option to get rid of harmful status for Umbreon and its team, but Toxic can be used over Heal Bell if it's not needed, as it can allow Umbreon to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Milotic, which it otherwise wouldn't be able to. Foul Play is the only way that Umbreon can do any meaningful damage, so it's chosen as the fourth move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment is used to maximize Umbreon's special bulk and let it check threats such as Nidoqueen and Swellow. However, a physically defensive spread is a viable option to let Umbreon act as a better check to the likes of Honchkrow, Zygarde-10%, and Metagross. Leftovers is used for passive recovery and goes really well with Protect. Synchronize is the only ability worth using, as inflicting the same status to the foe is more helpful, and it also synergizes with Heal Bell.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Umbreon to check threats such as Nidoqueen and Swellow throughout the game while utilizing Wish to heal Umbreon as well as pass it to other teammates that need it. However, be careful when using the Wish + Protect combination when healing Umbreon, as your opponent could easily see the Protect coming and take advantage of it by gaining momentum or setting up. Heal Bell only has 8 PP, so use it conservatively. For example, if you have a Pokemon that is burned but doesn't mind the Attack drop, saving Heal Bell for when other Pokemon get poisoned or burned might be better.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nidoqueen can set up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes and is also able to check the Fairy-, Fighting-, and Bug-type attacks and Pokemon that Umbreon's weak against while appreciating the Wish support and Umbreon's ability to switch into Psychic- and Ice-type attacks. Mantine is also a good teammate for the nice synergy that it provides, and it can also provide support with Defog. Diancie can pack Heal Bell to allow Umbreon to carry another move and benefits from the Wish support. In general, any bulky Pokemon that appreciates Wish or Heal Bell support, such as Mega Blastoise, Gigalith, Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Escavalier can be a nice option for a teammate.</p>"

Some of the Pokemon it checks include Nidoqueen, Salazzle, Gardevoir, Noivern, Swellow, and Necrozma. It has a premier ability in Regenerator that allows it to check these Pokemon throughout the match. Its extensive movepool includes a plethora of coverage and utility options like Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Dragon Tail. However, despite all its positives, it faces stiff competition for a slot on most teams from its Psychic-type counterparts such as Slowbro and Cresselia, which possess unique advantages including better natural physical bulk. It also has a crippling weakness to Pursuit and the ever-present Knock Off. Finally, Slowking struggles to take on the plethora of strong physical attackers in the tier, even ones without super effective coverage like Donphan, Zygarde-10%, and Bewear.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowking has a plethora of other options due to its expansive movepool, but it does still face competition from other bulky Water- and Psychic-types. A defensive Nasty Plot set can be used, as it boosts its Special Attack and is threatening faster than Slowbro and Cresselia. An offensive Trick Room set is an option to check special attackers while posing a bigger threat to offensive teams. Shadow Ball hits bulkier Psychic-types, such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and opposing Slowking, as well as Mismagius. Psychic or Psyshock are alternate STAB moves that can hit Toxicroak and Dragalge without waiting for Future Sight to hit, but typically Future Sight's power is appreciated.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, allowing it to check Fire-types and deny free switch-ins to physical attackers, such as Tsareena and Pangoro. Despite it not hitting immediately, Future Sight allows Slowking to limit future switches because it hits very hard. Fire Blast hits Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade as well as Steel-types such as Escavalier. Dragon Tail prevents Slowking from being setup fodder for Snorlax, Escavalier, and other bulky setup sweepers. It also works nicely with Future Sight because the foe will try to play around it by switching into a Dark- or Steel-type, which Dragon Tail will phaze out. Ice Beam is an option that allows Slowking to check Swellow, Dragalge, and Noivern more reliably.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Assault Vest bolsters Slowking's already great Special Defense, allowing it to act as a blanket check to special attackers. The main issue with running Assault Vest is that Slowking cannot run Slack Off, but Regenerator makes up for this and allows Slowking to check these attackers throughout the match. 252 HP EVs and 80 Special Defense EVs are used in order to take +2 Acid Downpour from Salazzle after Stealth Rock and check Swellow more reliably. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack, which, along with a Modest nature, allows Slowking to hit harder. Slowking can run many alternative EV spreads to check different threats. For example, it can run 136 Defense EVs to take Adamant Zygarde-10%'s Devastating Drake and Barbaracle's +2 Stone Edge, both after Stealth Rock. These are just two examples of alternative EV spreads; spreads with Speed investment to outspeed Bronzong or more Special Defense investment to be more forgiving against Salazzle are also possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot Slowking into Pokemon that it checks, such as Nidoqueen, Salazzle, and Sigilyph, so it can threaten the opposing team by using Future Sight or another STAB move. Remember that Regenerator is Slowking's only way of gaining back health, so it is even more important to pivot Slowking into Pokemon that it checks so it can recover health with its ability while avoiding losing it unnecessarily. Threaten physical attackers that try to switch into Slowking by going for Scald, which has a chance to burn and cripple them. Use Dragon Tail if you predict that the foe will attempt to set up. This is especially helpful against foes that cannot OHKO Slowking such as Snorlax, but you should be careful if the Pokemon in question is a strong physical attacker such as Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%. In conjunction with entry hazards, use Dragon Tail to wear down the opposing team quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking has a hard time taking on powerful physical attackers, even ones that do not have powerful super effective coverage, such as Bewear and Tyrantrum. As a result, Pokemon that take on these threats, such as Metagross, Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Mandibuzz, make for great partners. Golisopod also takes on some of these attackers while setting up Spikes, which Slowking can exploit by using Dragon Tail, and also revenge killing Grass- and Dark-types with First Impression. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade make for good teammates, as they take on the Grass- and Electric-types that threaten Slowking, like Raikou and Tsareena. They also appreciate Slowking taking on the Fire-types that threaten them. Similarly, Slowking appreciates teammates that can take on the Dark- and Ghost-types that threaten it. Examples of such Pokemon are Passimian, Florges, and Snorlax. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Flygon, Mandibuzz, and Mega Ampharos can give Slowking more opportunities to switch in, thus maximizing the amount of health it gains back from Regenerator.</p>"

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress's huge Defense stat lets it act as one of the best physical sponges in the tier, being able to switch into threats like Metagross, Virizion, and Bewear. Its access to all entry hazards and Rapid Spin makes it an appealing choice on teams that desire its ability to compress several roles in one, and its access to slow Volt Switch allows it to bring teammates in safely and avoid as much passivity as possible. Forretress's amazing typing only leaves it with a single weakness, although its neutrality to Rock and Flying as a Steel-type can put a strain on teambuilding. However, Forretress's extremely lacking base 60 Special Defense makes special attackers a huge threat to watch out for. Due to Forretress's lacking offensive presence beyond Volt Switch and Toxic, it is easily spinblocked by common Ghost-types like Mismagius and Alolan Marowak, while hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Sigilyph, and Mandibuzz are able to switch into it with impunity and remove whatever hazards Forretress had set up; this is somewhat mitigated by Forretress's ability to pivot out of them or put them on a timer with Toxic, however. Furthermore, a lack of reliable recovery means it is prone to being whittled down by Stealth Rock and other residual damage. Although Forretress's very low Speed stat will increase Gyro Ball's power, it will otherwise often be moving last against most Pokemon in the tier, which hinders its ability as a spinner and hazard setter; Pokemon like Rhyperior are able to KO it before it gets the opportunity to use Rapid Spin or Spikes. Lastly, Forretress possesses a crippling weakness to Fire, one of the best offensive typings in the meta, which severely undermines its defensive utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter is a serviceable option that lets Forretress be less passive and beat slower and bulkier Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Steelix. Forretress can be used as suicide lead with Custap Berry and Stealth Rock / Spikes / Explosion / Rapid Spin or Gyro Ball on hyper offensive teams, being able to set up multiple hazards and preventing either opposing hazards from being set or Forretress' hazards from being removed. Pin Missile is an option that nails entry hazard deterrents and removers like Espeon and Tsareena, as well as other setup sweepers like Celebrate Shaymin and Necrozma that can otherwise freely set up on Forretress, but it is very hard to fit on a moveset. Forretress has access to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes; however, these entry hazards are usually less useful than Spikes because of the former being more common than Spikes and the latter being easily removed by the plethora of relevant Poison-types in the tier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ninetales, Salazzle, and Arcanine are able to switch into Forretress with impunity and OHKO it due to its 4x weakness to Fire.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Forretress's very lacking Special Defense stat makes special attackers a huge threat to it. However, it is able to take a few resisted hits from some weaker special threats like Florges.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Forretress's lack of offenses makes it setup bait versus Pokemon like Salazzle, Snorlax, and Barbaracle. Although Volt Switch allows it to escape these matchups, it still gives them a free turn.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Palossand are able to switch into Forretress and spinblock it easily, preventing Forretress from accomplishing one of its roles.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Milotic and Slowbro are able to switch into Forretress with ease and threaten it with Scald. Additionally, Milotic doesn't care about Toxic due to Refresh.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Mandibuzz and Mismagius can prevent Forretress from setting Spikes, while Trick users such as Gardevoir and Espeon can cripple it by Tricking a Choice item.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyro Ball is Forretress's most consistent attacking move, and when coupled with its very low Speed, it will often have a high Base Power. Spikes is a useful support move that is able to punish switches. Volt Switch allows Forretress to pivot into another teammate and helps Forretress avoid being too passive and letting Pokemon set up on it. Rapid Spin lets Forretress act as entry hazard removal to support Pokemon like Yanmega and Houndoom. However, it usually isn't a very successful spinner due to the number of Ghost-types that are able to spinblock it, such as Mismagius, Palossand, and Alolan Marowak. Toxic lets it pressure more defensive hazard removers and spinblockers, such as Mandibuzz and Palossand.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Forretress maximize its physical bulk, allowing it to easily switch into threats such as Flygon and set Spikes or spin on them. Leftovers is the preferred item due to the passive recovery it grants. Overcoat allows Forretress to not be whittled down by hail from Mega Abomasnow and Vanilluxe and lets Forretress counter non-Hidden Power Fire Roserade and Venusaur, although both variants are rare. Sturdy can be used if these Pokemon are not a threat to live any hit from full. Forretress can alternatively invest in Special Defense to check some specific special attackers better, such as Mega Abomasnow and Choice Specs Gardevoir, although this means it would be less effective as a physical blanket check, and its Special Defensive is still mediocre when invested in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Forretress as a sponge against physical attackers like Zygarde-10% and Escavalier, and use Spikes or Rapid Spin when given free turns by them. Do not attempt to utilize it as a wall over extended periods of time, as Forretress is prone to being whittled down and won't be able to effectively pivot into the threats it's supposed to check. Instead, it performs excellently as a defensive pivot, switching into attacks and pivoting out to safety, bringing another teammate in with Volt Switch. Use Volt Switch against sweepers that can use Forretress as setup fodder to prevent them from cleaning your team. When an opposing Ghost-type is on the field, try and predict if it will attempt to switch into Forretress to spinblock it, and switch into an appropriate countermeasure or use Toxic on them. While it cannot switch into powerful special attacks, Forretress's wonderful defensive typing does allow it to come into certain resisted attacks such as Blizzard from Mega Abomasnow and Moonblast from Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Try and spread Toxic poison as much as possible to cripple walls such as Cresselia and Mandibuzz.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress appreciates support from clerics like Florges, which grant it far more longevity with Wish. Similarly, Healing Wish users such as Gardevoir and Shaymin pair well with Forretress. Due to its crippling Fire weakness, a solid Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Milotic, Rhyperior, Snorlax, or Noivern is necessary so your team is not as vulnerable to powerful Fire-types like Arcanine, Ninetales, and Salazzle. Forretress pairs well with wallbreakers and sweepers like Pangoro, Roserade, and Zygarde-10% that appreciate a slow and safe Volt Switch. A Pokemon with Pursuit like Drapion, Sneasel, or Aerodactyl is able to eliminate Ghost-types that may try to spinblock Forretress, allowing you to control entry hazards far more reliably. Pokemon like Ghost-types, Taunt users, and Passimian are able to deter the hazards Forretress sets up from being removed.</p>"

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Steelix carves a niche in the RU metagame with its ability to check physically offensive threats such as Tyrantrum thanks to its colossal Defense and solid defensive typing that grants it resistances to Normal, Rock, Steel, and Dragon. A 4x resistance to Stealth Rock combined with Leftovers allows Steelix to easily preserve Sturdy and act as an emergency check to threats such as Salazzle. However, a lack of reliable recovery means Steelix is easily worn down when switching into repeated attacks. Unlike other Steel-types such as Bronzong and Registeel, Steelix lacks a resistance to Ice or Grass, requiring teams to find other checks to Ice- and Grass-types. Additionally, Steelix's weakness to common types such as Water, Fighting, and Fire, poor special bulk, and relatively low Attack leave it exploitable by prominent threats such as Mega Blastoise, Shaymin, and Bewear.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gyro Ball with a Brave nature can be used instead of Heavy Slam to take advantage of Steelix's low Speed but fails to hit opposing slow Pokemon such as Florges for significant damage. Curse can be used to increase Steelix's offensive presence and make it harder to KO, allowing Steelix to better deal with Pokemon such as Metagross.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Mega Blastoise and Mantine can easily switch into Steelix's attacks and force Steelix out. However, they dislike switching into Toxic. Other Water-types such as Refresh Milotic, Seismitoad, and trapper Araquanid do not mind switching into Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Salazzle, Ninetales, and Houndoom are able to easily KO Steelix once Sturdy is broken. Mega Ampharos is especially notable because it can OHKO Steelix through Sturdy with Mold Breaker Focus Blast. None of these special attackers are able to safely switch into Steelix, however.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Shaymin and Virizion are able to easily switch into Earthquake and deal massive damage to Steelix. Roserade and Mega Abomasnow can also deal significant damage to Steelix but are unable to switch into Heavy Slam.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Bewear and Machamp can OHKO Steelix if Sturdy is broken, and Bewear is able to switch into Heavy Slam thanks to its ability Fluffy.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock enables Steelix to pressure opposing Pokemon with residual damage. Heavy Slam is Steelix's primary STAB move and allows it to hit Pokemon such as Florges and Diancie.

Toxic allows Steelix to cripple bulky Water-types such as Mega Blastoise, Seismitoad, and Mantine, which would otherwise take advantage of it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Investment in HP and Defense enhances Steelix's ability to check physical attackers like Tyrantrum. Leftovers provides Steelix with passive recovery and a way to regain Sturdy. Sturdy guarantees Steelix will survive at least one hit, allowing it to reliably set Stealth Rock or attack threats such as Salazzle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Steelix in against Pokemon it can check such as Tyrantrum in order to set Stealth Rock, but keep in mind that Steelix needs to stay relatively healthy in order to beat them.

It appreciates Pokemon that can handle bulky Water-types such as Roserade and Shaymin. Entry hazard removers such as Mantine and Mega Blastoise can clear hazards for Steelix, limiting its tendency to get worn down. Both of these Pokemon also appreciate Steelix's ability to check Electric-types such as Raikou. Clerics such as Florges and Vaporeon have the ability to heal Steelix with Wish. Florges also has the ability to check Fighting-types such as Bewear thanks to its Fairy typing.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>Sneasel carves itself a niche in the RU tier by virtue of its unique Dark and Ice STAB moves that make it difficult to switch into, as few Pokemon in the tier resist both; combined, they hit a wide expanse of the tier for super effective damage. This makes many common physical walls such as Mandibuzz, Rhyperior, and Slowbro wary of switching in on Sneasel. Additionally, its high Speed stat puts it above most of the unboosted tier, which, combined with its STAB Ice-type priority, makes it difficult for offensive teams to deal with and a great revenge killer for prominent offensive threats. Sneasel's access to Pursuit allows it to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon as well as catch threats that are weak to Ice as they switch out for big damage, which is a unique trait among Dark-types and sets it apart from rivals such as Drapion. However, Sneasel's frailty and poor defensive typing lead it to contribute little defensively and leave it unable to switch in on much, and a weakness to Stealth Rock can lead to it being worn down quickly. Also, a lackluster base Attack stat means Sneasel hits neutral targets for low damage and often misses OHKOs or 2HKOs on some bulkier targets, even those weak to it, which prevents it from dealing huge damage to teams from the get-go and means it requires support to realize its full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Eviolite and Swords Dance is an option, but it forfeits one of Sneasel's very valued moveslots and often misses the power from a boosting item. It is also rather difficult to set up with even with Eviolite and not particularly strong afterwards either. Focus Sash + Counter can be used to catch some physical attackers off guard, but this once again gives up one of Sneasel's moveslots. Additionally, unboosted Sneasel is quite weak, and it doesn't stay at full HP very well to utilize this strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types</strong>: Florges and Diancie are bulky enough to take Icicle Crash, resist Knock Off, and threaten Sneasel with an OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Milotic and Pyukumuku switch into Sneasel with ease and scare it off by threatening it with Scald or, in Pyukumuku's case, Counter. However, Knock Off is rather crippling, as it often gets rid of Leftovers or some other important item.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-type Pokemon, such as Forretress and Escavalier, have little problem taking on Sneasel, as they resist Icicle Crash, take Knock Off decently, and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB attacks. However, though they may take the hit, none of these Pokemon particularly enjoy being hit by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon Not Weak to Sneasel</strong>: Sneasel's below-average Attack means that bulky Pokemon that aren't weak to its STAB attacks such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Gigalith take little from Sneasel's attacks and force it to switch. Some offensive Pokemon with high Defense stats such as Cloyster also easily take hits from Sneasel and can use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Sneasel's frailty, offensive Pokemon that outspeed it such as Salazzle, as well as Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Gardevoir can KO it with ease, and only foes weak to Ice Shard have anything to fear in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is strong, is spammable, and removes items from targets, often leaving them vulnerable. Icicle Crash rounds out Sneasel's STAB coverage and allows it to threaten a wider range of Pokemon than most Dark-types, as well as threaten Ice-weak foes in order to take advantage of its speedy Pursuit. Its 30% flinch chance can also come in handy in a pinch. Ice Shard picks off weakened offensive threats and frail threats weak to Ice such as Swellow as well as revenge killing potent sweepers such as Rock Polish Tyrantrum and Chlorophyll Venusaur in sun. Pursuit allows Sneasel to secure KOs on weakened foes and takes advantage of the switches Sneasel causes with its high Speed and expansive coverage to deal large chunks to or outright KO the foe as it switches out. Low Kick could be used over Pursuit to nail Mega Glalie, Gigalith, Snorlax, and Registeel, which otherwise stop Sneasel in its tracks, but Sneasel doesn't often find space to use it, as its other options are generally more valuable. Similarly, Iron Tail is an option over Pursuit to hit other switch-ins in Florges, Diancie, and Gigalith hard on the switch, but Sneasel again can't fit it onto a moveset very easily, and Pokemon like Florges and Gigalith greatly dislike Knock Off to begin with. Also, Iron Tail is somewhat unreliable due to its low accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Speed and Attack EVs maximize Sneasel's offensive prowess, and a Jolly nature keeps Sneasel's amazing Speed tier intact, allowing it to stay faster than numerous threats such as Espeon, Heliolisk, Virizion, and Mismagius. None of its abilities are particularly practical, so Inner Focus is chosen for situational usefulness should Sneasel happen to take a weak Fake Out or another flinch-causing move. The item choice largely depends on the team: Choice Band is used for a large boost in power, makes Knock Off and Icicle Crash much more difficult to switch in to, and allows Sneasel to become a very threatening Pursuit trapper at the cost of being locked into the move afterwards. Life Orb is preferred on more offensive teams that want to take advantage of Sneasel's excellent dual STAB to break holes in the opposing team or effectively clean in the late-game, but it reduces the effectiveness of Pursuit. Black Glasses could be used to take advantage of the power boost to Pursuit and Knock Off while bluffing a Choice item, but the power is sorely missed on Ice-type moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its frailty and poor defensive typing, Sneasel is best used as a revenge killer or after being brought in by a slow U-turn or Volt Switch such as from Forretress. After getting Sneasel in, utilize its fantastic two-move coverage to threaten a large variety of prominent Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Goodra, Flygon, Shaymin, Donphan, and Bronzong. Use Knock Off liberally, as it has essentially no drawbacks and has the advantage of removing valuable items from foes. Also take advantage of Pursuit to trap problematic Psychic- and Ghost-types, and use the threat of Sneasel's Ice-type STAB moves to threaten out enemies weak to Ice in order to chunk them later with Pursuit. Additionally, due to Sneasel's high Speed and decent power, it can preserved for the late-game in order to act as a cleaner once its checks are sufficiently weakened. When using Sneasel, note that since Z-Crystals cannot be knocked off, so holding one reduces the Base Power of Knock Off to a paltry 65. This allows bulky foes weak to Dark such as Necrozma, Slowbro, and Cresselia to take advantage of Sneasel, as opposed to the other way around.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primary partners to Sneasel are Pokemon that can clean up after Sneasel has worn down the opposing team, such as Salazzle, Barbaracle, Swellow, and Choice Scarf Passimian. Sneasel also appreciates teammates that can break holes in the opposition for it to clean afterwards, such as Metagross, Goodra, Nidoqueen, and Salazzle. Teammates that enjoy Psychic- and Ghost-types weakened or removed, such as Roserade, Toxicroak, Snorlax, and Necrozma, value the support Sneasel brings to the table with Pursuit. Sneasel pairs well with partners that can dispatch bulky Water- and Fairy-types to allow Sneasel more room to break teams, such as Shaymin, Roserade, Toxicroak, Raikou, and Escavalier. Special mention goes to Roserade, as it threatens both of these typings and also sets up Spikes for Sneasel to capitalize on. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Heliolisk, Rotom-H, Choice Scarf Flygon, and Passimian are practically necessary to get Sneasel on the field outside of revenge killing. As Sneasel is frail and weak to numerous common typings such as Fire, Fighting, Fairy, and Steel, partners that can easily switch into and beat Pokemon of these typings are very appreciated, such as Metagross, Ninetales, Escavalier, and Salazzle. Sneasel also likes being paired with entry hazard setters, as it enjoys the extra chip damage to help support its below-average Attack and assist it in wallbreaking, late-game cleaning, and revenge killing. The aforementioned Nidoqueen and Roserade are especially good partners, as they enjoy offensive Psychic-types being removed by Sneasel and in return threaten and weaken bulky Fairy- and Water-types that Sneasel dislikes. Nidoqueen is also a soft Steel-type check, being able to switch into the likes of Escavalier and Registeel. Mega Glalie can form a threatening Ice-type spam core with Sneasel, as Sneasel is able to weaken or remove common Ice checks in Bronzong and Registeel, while Glalie can weaken Water-types for Sneasel with Freeze-Dry and set up Spikes for it to clean or wallbreak more effectively. Sneasel also very much appreciates hazard control on its own side, as it is worn down quickly between a weakness to Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil. Rapid Spin users such as Donphan also enjoy that Sneasel can remove Ghost-types that can block Rapid Spin with its Pursuit.</p>"

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantine's typing and excellent special bulk let it handle menacing, commonplace attackers like Mega Blastoise, Ninetales, and Roserade. The high usage of these attackers means it gets opportunities to switch in against many teams, letting it use Defog with decent consistency, and the ability to run any two of Air Slash, Scald, and Toxic can make it tricky for offensive teams to safely respond to early-game. However, vulnerability to Electric-type attacks and Toxic renders it easily forced out by Pokemon that might have those moves. Registeel and Bronzong are prevalent Stealth Rock users that practically always have Toxic, so it's extremely difficult for Mantine to keep entry hazards away against teams with them. A Stealth Rock weakness means it often switches in with significant HP lost and is under a lot of pressure to clear hazards, and the high number of Stealth Rock setters that run Toxic makes this job even harder. It faces significant competition from Milotic, which boasts greater versatility by not requiring three specific moves and the ability to beat Steel-types by using Refresh. Only having one customizable moveslot means it'll be helpless against certain setup users depending on its fourth move; for example, using Haze over Air Slash makes Toxicroak and Machamp a counter, and using Air Slash allows bulky Pokemon like Curse Snorlax to be a problem.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can hit Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types all at once, specifically surprising Noivern, but its overall poor coverage and power usually aren't worthwhile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Anything running Toxic, including common blanket checks like Registeel and Milotic, can leave Mantine pretty useless. It's too weak to KO foes before poison damage racks up. Almost every Pokemon can learn Toxic, so any attacker wanting to lure Mantine can easily do so.</p> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: A 4x weakness to Electric makes Mantine easily OHKOed or 2HKOed by anything running moves of the type. Such Pokemon include Raikou, Mega Ampharos, Rotom-C, Goodra, and Mismagius.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Mantine has fairly poor physical bulk, so any physical attacker faster than it has an easy time beating it. Wallbreakers like Guts Machamp and Choice Band Zygarde-10% are free to throw out attacks, and Swords Dance users such as Toxicroak and Virizion OHKO it after boosting. Most don't like taking one or both of Scald and Air Slash as they switch in, though.</p> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock removing a quarter of Mantine's HP puts it in KO range of attackers it could otherwise check like Poisonium Z Salazzle. Rock-types like Tyrantrum and Lycanroc-D force Mantine out with the power of their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Mantine's weak attacks render it helpless against Taunt users with recovery like Mandibuzz and Noivern.</p>",

      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aptitude at switching into common special attackers gives Mantine plenty of Defog opportunities. Scald's burn chance keeps physical attackers and Steel-types from switching in freely. Air Slash and Supersonic Skystrike hit Grass- and Fighting-types that could exploit Scald, including Virizion, Roserade, Shaymin, Hariyama, and Toxicroak. Haze eliminates boosts from special setup wallbreakers like Salazzle. Toxic is an option to take attackers like Mega Blastoise and Ninetales down as efficiently as possible.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>136 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Machamp, which would otherwise handle Mantine without issue. The remaining investment goes in special bulk to maximize Mantine's ability to check special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Opportunities to switch in come from common special attackers that can't hope to break through a healthy Mantine like Mega Blastoise and Ninetales. Supersonic Skystrike should punish Grass-types, Toxicroak, and Machamp expecting Scald on the switch, and spreading Toxic if Mantine has it weakens the opposition for a teammate to clean up. Blanket checks like Milotic can run Toxic, so they must be scouted before Mantine can safely switch in. However, trading Toxic with an opposing wall can be productive if Mantine is no longer necessary or your team has a cleric. Don't be afraid to let Mantine go down if the foes it checks have been sufficiently weakened for teammates to handle; putting too much focus on keeping Mantine around can drain your momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mantine's slow, somewhat passive nature limits it to balanced and defensive teams. Registeel and Ground-types such as Rhyperior absorb Electric-type attacks sent Mantine's way, and threatening physical attackers can be answered by bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia. Florges and Umbreon offer Heal Bell, meaning Mantine is much less afraid of Toxic users, and appreciate a solid Ninetales switch-in. Choice Scarf Gardevoir's Healing Wish is a way for more offensive teams to revitalize Mantine. Fast sweepers such as Zygarde-10% and Barbaracle appreciate Mantine softening the opposition up with Toxic and attacks.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Houndoom's typing gives it a powerful secondary Dark-type STAB move that much of the tier struggles against, lets it counter Pokemon like Ninetales, Necrozma, and Sigilyph in conjunction with its ability, helps it act as an offensive check to a plethora of Psychic-, Ghost-, and Fire-types, and gives it a good matchup against priority users like Toxicroak and Abomasnow. Houndoom has a great Speed tier, outpacing threats like Roserade, Toxicroak, and Gardevoir. A decent support movepool gives Houndoom options like Taunt that let it completely obliterate stall, shutting down staples such as Pyukumuku and Cresselia. However, Houndoom's bulk, particularly physically, leaves much to be desired and limits its setup opportunities. A glaring weakness to every entry hazard in the game, especially Stealth Rock, further limits its ability to set up and makes it difficult to check Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fire-types. Dark Pulse's low Base Power leaves Houndoom very reliant on its Z-Move against Water-types such as Milotic, meaning it'll be helpless against them if another Pokemon can successfully lure its Z-Move. Other Fire-types such as Salazzle and Ninetales are usually more consistent picks due to their amazing Speed and much better damage output, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute lets Houndoom threaten slower teams that rely on their Choice Scarf user to force out setup sweepers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Faster Rock-types such as Lycanroc-D, Gigalith, and Tyrantrum beat Houndoom with their super effective STAB attacks. Gigalith can even stomach a boosted Black Hole Eclipse, so it does not need to worry when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Passimian as well as faster threats like Virizion force out Houndoom with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types threaten Houndoom, especially after it has used its Z-Move, and others like specially defensive Milotic outright beat it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Defensive threats like specially defensive Milotic, Diancie, Goodra, and Snorlax can take hits from Houndoom and KO it in return. Although some walls can be threatened by Houndoom's Z-Move, after it has been used, they have no trouble walling it.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot lets Houndoom boost its Special Attack to scary levels. Dark Pulse is Houndoom's strongest, most reliable STAB attack that can be boosted by Darkinium Z for a one-time nuke. Fire Blast is Houndoom's secondary STAB attack that hits harder at the cost of accuracy. Taunt lets Houndoom get around Pokemon like Toxic Mandibuzz and lets it decimate stall staples like Pyukumuku. It is also fantastic for stopping Pokemon like Porygon2 from healing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs along with a Timid nature let Houndoom outpace Pokemon like Roserade. Darkinium Z lets Houndoom break through defensive counterplay like Milotic after boosting. Flash Fire gives Houndoom some defensive utility, letting it hard counter Ninetales.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Understand that many Fire-, Psychic-, and Ghost-types are free setup for Houndoom, so use this to your advantage by positioning Houndoom against Pokemon like Ninetales and Sigilyph. Keep in mind that using unboosted Dark Pulse and sometimes Fire Blast is a great middle-ground play that can discourage offensive early-game plays like hard switching to revenge killers, notably Tyrantrum and Virizion. Chip down defensive threats such as specially defensive Milotic and clear entry hazards from your side of the field so as to give Houndoom an easier time at breaking the opposing team. If given the opportunity, eliminate revenge killers that threaten Houndoom. Use Taunt against stall to prevent Pokemon like Toxic Pyukumuku and Toxic Cresselia from crippling Houndoom. Similarly, prevent walls like Porygon2 and Mantine from healing by using Taunt on them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivots like U-turn Noivern, Volt Switch Raikou or Mega Ampharos can bring Houndoom in freely, giving it more setup opportunities. Roserade provides Spikes, which is fantastic for softening walls, and can take on a few specific checks to Houndoom, notably Mega Blastoise and specially defensive Milotic. If using Houndoom on a balance team, make sure to pack answers to common Pokemon that force it out. For example, Registeel can take on opposing Choice Scarf Tyrantrum and provide Stealth Rock, and Mandibuzz can answer Zygarde-10% and Virizion. Pair Houndoom with entry hazard removers like Mega Blastoise so that when it comes in to set up it won't drop to a weak attack. Be wary of stacking heavy weakness when teambuilding with Houndoom. For example, it's very easy to stack a Ground weakness when using a core like Houndoom + Toxicroak, so make sure to patch up the team later on with a sturdy answer to Ground-types, notably physically defensive Mandibuzz or Tsareena.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Ice is able to OHKO Zygarde-10% and Noivern, the latter after Stealth Rock damage, which can otherwise take a hit and KO Houndoom one-on-one. Destiny Bond allows Houndoom to take out foes that could otherwise soak up its attacks like Goodra and Snorlax, but keep in mind that it can't be used in rapid succession. Overheat serves as a powerful STAB move that achieves KOs against Pokemon that Fire Blast misses out on such as Virizion and Raikou while boasting generally higher power and slightly better accuracy. However, note that the Special Attack drop upon use makes it difficult to spam repeatedly. Toxic cripples defensive switch-ins like Milotic and Mantine, putting them on a timer. Hidden Power Grass is a viable alternative to Hidden Power Ice that takes out Rhyperior and Seismitoad at the expense of missing out on Hidden Power Ice targets like Zygarde-10% and Noivern.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>12 Defense EVs allow Houndoom to always survive Choice Band Zygarde-10%'s Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are tailored to maximizing both Houndoom's damage output and Speed, and a Timid nature ensures that it outpaces Pokemon like Choice Scarf Toxicroak and +1 Adamant Flygon. A Modest nature is a viable option with its ability to more reliably 2HKO Arcanine and OHKO Mismagius, but it leaves Houndoom unable to outspeed the Pokemon previously mentioned. Flash Fire grants Houndoom an immunity to Fire-type attacks, allowing it to better take on Pokemon like Ninetales.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Houndoom operates as a revenge killer as well as a late-game cleaner once checks such as Milotic and Florges are disposed of. Utilizing its Speed tier and decently powerful attacks, Houndoom can revenge kill generally fast Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum. Choosing to not reveal Houndoom's item also allows it to surprise and take out foes like Virizion and Zygarde-10% one-on-one, which could otherwise outspeed and OHKO it. Houndoom can make use of Flash Fire to pivot into Pokemon like Ninetales and Choice-locked Salazzle, which pose no threat to Houndoom and give it a chance to freely fire off a move. While it can switch into weaker attacks like Mega Abomasnow's Ice Shard, Houndoom generally wants to be brought in through slow pivots, as its poor bulk limits its chances of directly switching into most Pokemon. Finally, while Houndoom's fourth moveslot options are effective for dealing with its checks or breaking past certain Pokemon, it is ill-advised to use these moves recklessly, as being Choice-locked into any one of these moves can be highly exploitable by setup sweepers and wallbreakers alike.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Zygarde-10%, Mega Ampharos, and Machamp help break down Pokemon that Houndoom struggles against like Diancie, Mandibuzz, and Porygon2 while also being generally strong Pokemon that can weaken teams to aid Houndoom in cleaning late-game. The likes of Zygarde-10% and Raikou also appreciate Houndoom's ability to break past Grass- and Ice-types like Shaymin and Sneasel. Entry hazard setters such as Metagross and Rhyperior can chip down the opposing team, giving Houndoom more leeway when attempting to revenge kill or clean. Metagross also possesses the firepower to dismantle many of Houndoom's checks, including Florges, Gigalith, and Mantine if running Thunder Punch, while providing both momentum and wallbreaking potential with Explosion. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Tsareena, and Florges allows Houndoom to enter play more often, and Tsareena can provide additional pivoting capabilities through U-turn. Choice Scarf Houndoom fails to outspeed particularly fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Flygon and +1 Shaymin, so Pokemon like Tangela and Goodra can be switched in to sponge attacks that would otherwise power through it.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's niche in RU is carved by its ability to break past Pokemon such as Cresselia and Umbreon thanks to Sniper, Focus Energy, and Scope Lens. A reasonable Speed stat allows Kingdra to outpace metagame staples such as Nidoqueen, Mega Blastoise, and Necrozma, and it can take advantage of its typing to use Pokemon like Milotic and Bronzong as setup fodder. However, Kingdra's mediocre bulk can make it difficult to set up both Focus Energy and Substitute or Agility, especially if the opponent plays wisely enough to pressure it throughout the game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs Swift Swim Kingdra can be used on rain teams, but weather generally isn’t a good playstyle in RU. A cleaner set that utilizes a set of Draco Meteor / Hydro Pump / Rain Dance / Ice Beam and Life Orb / Dragonium Z can be used as well. However, Kingdra's power is very underwhelming, so it's usually better off running Focus Energy and Agility to retain a good match up against offensive teams while still having some use against bulky teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Gardevoir can revenge kill Kingdra. Other Pokemon like Noivern, Swellow, and Yanmega outpace and revenge kill Kingdra thanks to having moves that bypass Substitute such as Boomburst and Bug Buzz.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Speically defensive Pokemon like Florges, Snorlax, and Cresselia can stomach a hit from Kingdra and retaliate with their own attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "CritDra": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Energy allows Kingdra to boost its critical hit rate. Draco Meteor is Kingdra's strongest STAB attack and synergizes well with Focus Energy and Scope Lens because critical hits ignore Draco Meteor's Special Attack drops. Hydro Pump lets Kingdra hit Fairy- and Steel-types that would otherwise wall it like Gardevoir and Registeel and OHKO Pokemon that can survive a Draco Meteor like Rhyperior. Surf is an alternative option that is more accurate than Hydro Pump but does not OHKO Pokemon like Gardevoir. Substitute lets Kingdra threaten defensive teams that might try to beat it with more passive means such as Toxic. Running Agility over Substitute allows Kingdra to improve its matchup against offensive teams, and is particularly useful if Kingdra is being run on double screens teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scope Lens used in conjunction with Focus Energy allows Kingdra to achieve a critical hit every time it attacks. Sniper greatly increases the power of Kingdra's critical hits. A Timid nature and 252 EVs invested in Speed let Kingdra outpace Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise and Necrozma. 252 EVs invested in Special Attack maximize Kingdra's wallbreaking potential.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Substitute on predicted status moves from Pokemon like Milotic in order to gain setup opportunities. Play sensibly against Choice-locked Pokemon that could potentially give you free setup opportunities. For example, if a Choice Scarf Salazzle is locked into Fire Blast, Kingdra can force a switch or easily take the 4x resisted attack and set up Focus Energy or a Substitute. When utilizing Substitute, play wisely to get Kingdra positioned against Pokemon it can freely set up a Substitute against, such as Milotic and Araquanid. Many Choice Scarf users like Roserade threaten Kingdra’s attempts to sweep, so make sure to scout for potential Choice Scarf users and handle all of them before attempting a sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Salazzle, Nidoqueen, and Metagross deal with Fairy-types that Kingdra can't get around like Florges, making them great teammates. Likewise, Dragon-types like Flygon and Zygarde-10% prevent Kingdra from setting up, so Pokemon such as Mega Glalie are also good teammates. Entry hazard setters like Roserade, Nidoqueen, Steelix, Mega Glalie, and Rhyperior are great teammates; the chip damage that hazards provide helps Kingdra KO Pokemon like Umbreon and Florges. Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Vanilluxe, and Salazzle, which struggle with special walls like Cresselia, work great in tandem with Kingdra, as they can help each other wear down their checks and counters. Checks to Yanmega and Swellow such as Snorlax and Registeel are important teammates for Kingdra, since both can bypass Kingdra's Substitute using Bug Buzz or Boomburst. If running Substitute, Kingdra can improve its matchup against offensive teams by partnering with a Sticky Web user like Galvantula or Ribombee.</p>"

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>With its solid typing and great Attack and Defense, Donphan is a reliable tank in RarelyUsed that can check top threats in the tier such as Zygarde-10%, Noivern, and Tyrantrum. Donphan is also unique in that it has access to Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards and Ice Shard as a priority move to pick off weakened threats such as Zygarde-10%, Roserade, and Noivern. Despite these solid traits, Donphan's biggest issue is that it is easy to wear down with weak attacks and status conditions thanks to a lack of reliable recovery. This is especially bad considering Donphan has to repeatedly switch into Pokemon it is supposed to check and entry hazards to clear them away, breaking its Sturdy ability every time. Donphan may have a high Attack, but it has issues breaking common defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Mantine. Donphan's low Speed and Special Defense are easily exploited by Pokemon that can hit it with super effective attacks such as Mega Blastoise, Roserade, and Milotic. While Donphan's typing and bulk allows it to check Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types, it still receives tough competition from other entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, and Mantine thanks to either stronger offensive presences with Mega Blastoise or better resistances and recovery with Mandibuzz and Mantine. It also has competition as an offensive Ground-type from the likes of Zygarde-10% and Rhyperior. Zygarde-10% is much faster and has a better STAB move with Thousand Arrows, while Rhyperior has a higher Attack and better typing both offensively and defensively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used so Donphan has a better match up against physically defensive Pokemon such as Milotic without Refresh and Mandibuzz. Choice Band is a decent option that gives Donphan more immediate power. Donphan also has interesting coverage options such as Gunk Shot and Seed Bomb to hit targets that other Ground-types cannot. However, this set is largely outclassed by Rhyperior thanks to its higher Attack, better coverage options, and stronger defensive presence thanks to its Solid Rock ability taking super effective hits that Donphan cannot. Stone Edge can be used on the main set to hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Noivern, Honchkrow, and Mandibuzz for super effective damage, but the utility provided by Ice Shard and Knock Off are much more useful. A defensive set can be appealing thanks to Donphan's solid bulk. However, this set is lackluster because Donphan lacks reliable recovery and sacrifices its power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As Donphan lacks a reliable way to recover its HP, it is easily worn down by entry hazards and status conditions such as poison from Toxic. Burns from Will-O-Wisp not only chip away at Donphan's HP, but they also halve its Attack, making it lose a lot of offensive pressure against the foe. Poison from Toxic puts Donphan on a timer, and the residual damage stacks up.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: While Donphan has great raw power, it still fails to dent Pokemon with high Defense stats such as Milotic, Mandibuzz, and Tangela because all of these Pokemon can shrug off a hit from Donphan and recover their HP. Golisopod resists all of Donphan's attacks and retaliates back with Liquidation. Cloyster also survives any attack Donphan uses on it and sets up Shell Smash against it.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Gardevoir, and Espeon target Donphan's much weaker Special Defense stat, forcing it out of battle.</p> <p><strong>Water- and Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Barbaracle, and Milotic threaten out Donphan with their powerful STAB moves. Similarly, Grass-type Pokemon such as Virizion and Shaymin resist Earthquake and also threaten to KO Donphan. However, most of the Water-type Pokemon and Roserade do not want to switch into Donphan's Earthquake, and weakened Grass-types do not want to stay in on Donphan's Ice Shard or even the rare Gunk Shot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin is the most important move in this set because it removes entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes for its team. Earthquake is Donphan's most powerful STAB move that deals with Pokemon such as Metagross, Arcanine, and Tyrantrum. Knock Off further supports Donphan's team by crippling Pokemon reliant on their items such as Bronzong, Porygon2, and Registeel. It is also great against Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mismagius that try to switch in on Rapid Spin. Ice Shard is crucial so that Donphan can check weakened offensive threats such as Roserade, Virizion, and Noivern. The move is also a guaranteed OHKO against Zygarde-10% after Stealth Rock. Gunk Shot can be utilized to gain momentum against any Grass-type Pokemon that tries to switch into Donphan such as Shaymin and Virizion, as well as to damage Gardevoir and Florges more. Stealth Rock can be utilized if Donphan’s team lacks a dedicated user of the move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV set allows Donphan to be as strong and sturdy as possible. Leftovers gives Donphan a little extra health back every turn so that it has an easier time checking Pokemon such as Zygarde-10%, Tyrantrum, and Toxicroak, allowing Donphan to Rapid Spin more often by restoring its Sturdy if it comes in on Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Donphan is a Rapid Spinner designed to tank hits from physically attacking Pokemon such as Zygarde-10%, Tyrantrum, and Toxicroak, so it needs to be as healthy as possible throughout the match. This is especially true if the opponent still has an entry hazard setter and if Donphan has a teammate that needs hazard control. Donphan can easily come in on Stealth Rock users that do not threaten it very much, such as Metagross, Registeel, or Tank Rhyperior. It can also come into battle with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch if a teammate has fainted or from an aggressive double switch. From there, Donphan can threaten the opponent out with a powerful Earthquake or revenge kill with Ice Shard if the foe is weakened enough. If the opponent has a Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mismagius or Alolan Marowak and switches them in on Donphan expecting it to go for Rapid Spin, then it is advised to go for Knock Off, as the move does massive damage to these Pokemon, putting Mismagius within Ice Shard KO range and heavily crippling Alolan Marowak. Do not let Donphan take any status conditions, as poison from Toxic severely limits its longevity and the number of times it can switch in on Pokemon it is supposed to check. Being burned from Will-O-Wisp, meanwhile, makes Donphan lose offensive pressure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Donphan appreciates support from clerics such as Umbreon or Vaporeon or Healing Wish users such as Shaymin and Gardevoir, as Donphan itself lacks a reliable form of recovery. Pokemon such as Ninetales, Noivern, Salazzle, and Swellow appreciate Donphan's ability to clear entry hazards away and threaten Stealth Rock users. These Pokemon also appreciate Donphan's ability to threaten out Zygarde-10%. Teammates that can absorb Water-type attacks aimed at Donphan such as Virizion, Toxicroak, Mantine, and Seismitoad are needed. On that note, partners like Roserade, Shaymin, and Raikou can also keep Water-type Pokemon in check. Donphan also needs partners that can take Grass-type attacks such as Ninetales, Metagross, or Registeel. Metagross and Registeel also provide entry hazards for Donphan's team. Donphan, in return, can check Ground-types for Metagross and Registeel. Spikes setters such as Roserade and Golisopod love that Donphan can remove entry hazards without removing their own Spikes. Slow pivots such as Mega Ampharos, Mandibuzz, or Forretress can help bring Donphan safely into battle. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Snorlax, Florges, and Goodra can help take attacks that target Donphan's weaker Special Defense.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the most physically bulky Pokemon in RU thanks to the combination of its very good physical bulk that is further boosted by Eviolite. Access to Recover lets it stay healthy throughout a match and allows it to be a reliable check to common wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Tyrantrum. Porygon2 also has the ability Trace, which can allow it to copy a potentially useful defensive ability such as Prism Armor, Regenerator, or Water Absorb. While Porygon2 sounds like an amazing Pokemon in the metagame, it is weak against the prominent Fighting-types such as Virizion, Machamp, and Toxicroak. Porygon2's bulk is largely thanks to Eviolite, so once it loses it from Knock Off or Trick, it becomes much easier to take out. Furthermore, Porygon2's vulnerability to residual damage from entry hazards and Toxic mean that it can be overwhelmed easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive set utilizing Z-Conversion with Download, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Conversion, and Recover can potentially make Porygon2 much more offensively threatening. However, without defensive investment and Eviolite, it is difficult to set up and it is still outsped by Zygarde-10% even if it does set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Porygon2's Normal typing means that it takes super effective damage from common Fighting-types such as Virizion, Machamp, and Toxicroak, though Virizion and Toxicroak do not want to switch into a Thunder Wave at the risk of losing their speed. While Machamp can exploit Toxic or Thunder Wave to get a Guts boost, being fully paralyzed can potentially cost it a crucial KO and being badly poisoned does put Machamp on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Losing Eviolite</strong>: Because Porygon2 is over reliant on its Eviolite, it cannot stay in against Knock Off users like Machamp, Drapion, and Donphan, as well as Trick and Switcheroo users like Gardevoir, Choice Scarf Metagross, and Choice Scarf Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Escavalier can easily take any of Porygon2's attacks and force it out of battle. Metagross can potentially chip Porygon2 with Stealth Rock and Toxic. However, Metagross and Escavalier do not want to switch into Foul Play or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Porygon2 can have issues against common wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Roserade, and Shaymin. Shaymin can lower Porygon2's Special Defense with Seed Flare and proceed to take it out the next turn. Z-Move users such as Ninetales, Raikou, and Salazzle can OHKO Porygon2 with their respective Z-Moves after Stealth Rock damage at +2.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax and Calm Mind Cresselia take very little from any of Porygon2's moves and can easily set up in front of it. Cresselia can even block Toxic with Substitute and begin setting up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While it has access to Recover, Porygon2 lacks a reliable method of dealing with status conditions, especially Toxic. It also takes damage from all entry hazards every time it comes into the battle.</p>",

It also deals considerable damage to Tyrantrum. Foul Play allows Porygon2 to be a reliable check to Metagross. Toxic can be used to break down bulkier Pokemon, while Thunder Wave can paralyze fast offensive threats. Thunderbolt can be run on this set alongside Ice Beam for BoltBeam coverage. It would also allow Porygon2 to hit Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mega Blastoise, and Mantine much harder. However, the ability to check physical attackers with Foul Play is generally more important.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense EVs along with Eviolite makes Porygon2 as physically bulky as possible. Trace allows Porygon2 to copy the foe's ability, which can potentially aid in its defensive utility.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Porygon2 can easily come in on most physical attackers like Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Tyrantrum and cripple them with Toxic or Thunder Wave, chip them down with Ice Beam or Foul Play, or recover any health lost with Recover. Porygon2 can also pivot into certain Pokemon to copy their abilities to aid in its defensive role. For example, copying Slowbro's Regenerator can help heal its HP when it switches out, Mantine and Seismitoad's Water Absorb makes it immune to Scald, and Espeon's Magic Bounce can help it bounce Toxic and Stealth Rock back at the foe. Use Recover liberally to make sure that Porygon2 doesn't struggle to check the threats it's supposed to. Do not let Porygon2 get afflicted with status conditions, especially Toxic, because they're detrimental to its defensive utility. Keep Porygon2 away from a potential Knock Off or Trick because it needs its Eviolite to tank hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Porygon2 cannot do much to defensive Steel-types like Registeel, partners like Arcanine, Machamp, and Nidoqueen can be very beneficial because they can all deal super effective damage to them. Z-Move users like Synthesis Virizion and Z-Celebrate Shaymin, as well as Mega Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Ampharos, can help Porygon2 by providing it with a switch-in to an incoming Knock Off or Trick. Defensive Psychic-types, like Slowbro and Cresselia, and offensive ones, like Gardevoir and Necrozma, can deal with Fighting-types, making them ideal teammates for Porygon2. Gardevoir can also potentially provide Healing Wish support in case Porygon2 becomes afflicted with Toxic. Heal Bell users like Florges and Vaporeon can heal Porygon2 afflicted with Toxic poison. Florges also resists Knock Off thanks to its Fairy typing.</p>"

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou is one of the premier Calm Mind users in RarelyUsed thanks to its great stats and decent movepool, allowing it to take on a multitude of threats. Its great Speed means it can outpace most of the biggest threats in RarelyUsed, including Ninetales, Espeon, and Virizion, and Speed ties with Zygarde-10%. Its amazing Special Attack, powered up by Calm Mind as well as Z-Moves, allows Raikou to punch massive holes in just about everything in the tier for neutral damage with just Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice as well as its various coverage options like Aura Sphere, Extrasensory, and Shadow Ball. Its good bulk also allows it to be an effective user of Substitute, which can allow it to safely set up. Raikou is also a very versatile and unpredictable Pokemon; it can also be a decent wallbreaker with Choice Specs, a revenge killer with Choice Scarf, or a pivot with Assault Vest and can utilize many different Z-Crystals with its Calm Mind sets. However, while Raikou has decent mixed bulk for an offensive Pokemon, its noticeably lower Defense stat means that it's vulnerable to being revenge killed by Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, Assault Vest Machamp, Arcanine, and especially Ground-type coverage move users. Despite Raikou's high offensive stats, its damage output is rather unimpressive without a boost or a Z-Crystal, which can potentially leave it walled by common special walls such as Florges, Snorlax, and Goodra. It is also prone to being worn down by entry hazards and Toxic, which can shorten its sweep and reduce the number of times it can use Substitute. Despite these few shortcomings, Raikou is still unparalleled as an Electric-type in RarelyUsed.</p>",

Other Z-Crystals such as Ghostium Z, Psychium Z, and Electrium Z, in conjunction with Shadow Ball, Extrasensory, or Thunderbolt, can also be used to power past certain Pokemon such as Metagross, Bronzong, Virizion, Venusaur, and Dragalge for much more damage than usual. The Z-Move is incredibly flexible and can be crafted to fit Raikou's team. Raikou can utilize Choice Specs to become a powerful wallbreaker with immediate offensive pressure. Choice Scarf is also appealing so that Raikou can outpace the entire unboosted metagame and pivot with Volt Switch. Assault Vest is another viable alternative so that Raikou can function as a pivot that can survive special attacks from Pokemon like Mega Blastoise and Noivern. Keep in mind that these options forfeit the wallbreaking power that Z-Crystals can provide. Raikou can use Weather Ball if it is paired with a weather setter like Ninetales or Vanilluxe so that it has a better matchup against specific targets: Ninetales can help Raikou beat Grass- and Steel-types by turning Weather Ball into a Fire-type attack, and Vanilluxe turns it into an Ice-type move that can beat Grass- and Dragon-types. However, Weather Ball is heavily reliant on weather being set up, making it a rather inconsistent option, and like Aura Sphere locks Raikou into a Rash nature. Life Orb can give Raikou a little extra power on top of Calm Mind boosts, but it does cut into Raikou's longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground-types such as Zygarde-10%, Rhyperior, and Flygon are immune to Raikou's STAB attacks and threaten to revenge kill it with their own STAB moves. However, none of them want to directly switch into a Hidden Power Ice or Grass, and they can fail to revenge kill Raikou if it is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Raikou's Defense is considerably lower than its Special Defense, which can make it vulnerable to physically offensive Pokemon that can take a Thunderbolt such as Tyrantrum, Toxicroak, and Assault Vest Machamp.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Registeel, Snorlax, and Goodra can take any of Raikou's moves and can retaliate against it from there. However, Registeel and Snorlax do not want to take a boosted All-Out Pummeling from the Calm Mind set.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Toxic</strong>: Raikou is vulnerable to residual damage from all entry hazards and poison from Toxic, which can cut into its health and not allow it to sweep as well as at could at full health.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: When running Aura Sphere, Raikou is forced to have a Rash nature. This can make it miss out on outspeeding threats that a Timid Raikou should have no trouble with, such as Espeon and Virizion. Regardless, Timid Raikou is still outpaced by Salazzle and Choice Scarf users such as Tyrantrum, Drapion, and Passimian.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Raikou a safety net against incoming attacks and status conditions so that it can set up with Calm Mind. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice combined give Raikou perfect coverage to hit everything in RarelyUsed for neutral damage. Hidden Power Grass can be run instead to hit Pokemon like Rhyperior, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon much harder, but forgoing Hidden Power Ice does make Raikou struggle against Grass- and Dragon-types such as Shaymin and Dragalge. Raikou can still set up against Roserade and Venusaur if they switch into a Calm Mind, however. Protect is a viable choice over Substitute, as it allows Raikou to more reliably rack up Leftovers recovery, scout for potential Choice Scarf users, and block Golisopod's First Impression.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Timid is the preferred nature so that Raikou can be as fast as possible with maximum Speed investment. Pressure combined with Substitute can give Raikou an edge in PP stalling wars. Leftovers provides passive recovery that can help keep Raikou healthy as well as compensate for the HP lost from using Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Raikou can perform its role all throughout a match. In the early stages of a battle, it can scout the foe's set by setting up Substitute. Late-game, after its checks and counters have been softened or taken out, Raikou can clean up with Calm Mind. Make absolutely sure Raikou is healthy when it is ready to begin sweeping. Poison from Toxic puts it on a timer and limits the number of times it can use Substitute. Unlike all-out offensive Calm Mind sets, this Raikou can set up Calm Mind in front of Toxic users such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Mandibuzz thanks to Substitute. Keep in mind that Hidden Power in general is a weak coverage move and can do lackluster damage to its target, whether it's against Rhyperior, Seismitoad, or Shaymin, so make sure that those Pokemon are weakened first. To bring Raikou safely into battle, bring it in via a pivot, on an aggressive double switch, or after a partner has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots like Flygon, Mandibuzz, and Forretress can help bring Raikou safely into battle. Forretress can also set up Spikes so that Raikou can net KOs it couldn't before. Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Shaymin, and Donphan can help keep Ground-types in check. Donphan and Mega Blastoise can also clear entry hazards away for Raikou. Raikou also appreciates Grass- and Dragon-types checks as partners. Salazzle, Gardevoir, and Florges are good examples of Pokemon to pair with Raikou in this regard. Physical wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Machamp are also good partners for Raikou because they threaten the special walls that can stop Raikou from sweeping. A cleric or Healing Wish user like Vaporeon, Shaymin, or Gardevoir can heal Raikou in case it has been poisoned or taken damage prior from when it's ready to sweep.</p>"

      "Calm Mind + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind can turn Raikou into a potentially threatening late-game cleaner. Thunderbolt is Raikou's most consistent STAB move, dealing decent damage to a wide number of targets. Hidden Power Ice allows Raikou to hit Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt such as Roserade, Virizion, and Zygarde-10%. Hidden Power Grass can be run instead of Hidden Power Ice to deal more damage to Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad, but this can make Raikou struggle against Pokemon like Roserade and Dragalge. Aura Sphere does more damage to Pokemon like Registeel, Snorlax, and Rhyperior. Hyper Beam paired with Normalium Z can be run instead to deal massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it, ideally Grass- or Dragon-types like Virizion, Venusaur, and Goodra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z turns Aura Sphere into an All-Out Pummeling that can OHKO Rhyperior and Tyrantrum, 2HKO Registeel, Metagross, and Snorlax at +1, and deal 50% to Bronzong at +1. Because Aura Sphere is an event-exclusive move, Raikou is nature locked to always be Rash. Timid should be run instead if Raikou chooses to run Normalium Z + Hyper Beam so that Raikou doesn't miss out on outspeeding Espeon or Virizion. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Raikou to hit as hard and fast as possible. Keep in mind with Rash that Raikou is outsped by Pokemon such as Zygarde-10%, Virizion, and Lycanroc-D, but it still can outspeed Ninetales. Pressure is Raikou's only ability, but this set can utilize it by winning PP stall wars with the foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Raikou can either help its team break down walls early- to mid-game or set up and clean late-game once faster threats such as Virizion, Espeon, and Zygarde-10% are gone. Raikou should never directly come in on any attack, since it needs to be healthy as possible when it is ready to sweep. Instead, bring it in on an aggressive double switch or with the help of a slow pivot like Forretress and Tsareena. Raikou should set up on Pokemon that are of no threat to it such as Slowbro, Porygon2, and opposing Raikou. It can aim to set up on Scald users like Milotic or Slowbro, as being burned is less detrimental to it than being afflicted by Toxic. Try to save Raikou's Z-Move for a target that resists its BoltBeam coverage; All-Out Pummeling should aim to dent Snorlax, Registeel, and Rhyperior, while Breakneck Blitz should be used against Pokemon like Shaymin, Virizion, and Goodra. Raikou should not be afflicted with Toxic because the residual damage adds up over time, shortening the amount of time that Raikou can sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raikou needs a partner that can deal with Ground-types, as they stop its sweep short. Pokemon such as Shaymin, Virizion, Seismitoad, and Tangela fit this role excellently. Entry hazard setters such as Roserade, Necrozma, and Golisopod make Raikou's sweep much easier. Araquanid can also be beneficial; since this Raikou is outsped by Pokemon that Timid variants outpace, having Sticky Web to slow down these Pokemon should be considered. Healing Wish users like Gardevoir or clerics like Florges can keep Raikou healthy so that it can continue to function throughout the game. Heal Bell users in particular help cure Raikou of potential status conditions like Toxic. Pokemon such as Arcanine, Barbaracle, and Nidoqueen appreciate Raikou's ability to beat bulky Water-type Pokemon. Physical wallbreakers such as Machamp, Bewear, and Virizion can help Raikou by threatening or weakening the special walls that can prevent it from sweeping through the opposing team. Physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Tangela, and Donphan can help Raikou take on attacks that are aimed at Raikou's lower Defense. Donphan can also help Raikou by keeping hazards off the field with Rapid Spin.</p>"

  "Swellow": {
    "overview": "<p>Swellow has access to Scrappy Boomburst, and coupled with its incredible Speed and decent Special Attack stat, makes Swellow one of the most troublesome Pokemon for offensive teams to deal with. Additionally, it naturally outspeeds very fast Pokemon such as Virizion, Salazzle, and Noivern, all of which pose an issue to offensive teams. Swellow also has coverage moves that can hit Pokemon that resist Boomburst and U-turn to give it momentum, allowing it to perform well even against defensive teams. However, Swellow is incredibly frail and is almost always 2HKOed if not OHKOed by most neutral hits. Furthermore, being a Flying-type hinders its ability to spam U-turn when Stealth Rock is on the field.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used over Choice Specs with Work Up over the last move to punish certain specially defensive Pokemon such as Mantine, Porygon2, and Umbreon, although it finds it difficult to set up. Tailwind or Defog can also be used as the last move on the Choice Specs set, the former allowing Swellow's teammates to be more threatening by doubling their Speed, and the latter providing an emergency removal of hazards should the team's main hazard remover go down. However, most teams appreciate its ability to always revenge kill Virizion from full. Flame Orb with Guts and Facade is an option, but it is suboptimal because it's weaker than Choice Specs and has far more checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Gigalith, Rhyperior, Diancie, and Registeel can tank Boombursts and attempt to set up entry hazards or hit Swellow hard with their STAB moves. However, they should be wary of Swellow clicking U-turn and switching to a teammate that can handle them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mantine, Umbreon, and Snorlax can tank a Boomburst and hit Swellow hard. Mantine has to be careful of not switching into Swellow with Stealth Rock up, as it can then be 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon</strong>: With a Choice Scarf, Passimian, Tyrantrum, Gardevoir, and Flygon all outspeed Swellow and can KO it, although none of them would like to switch into Boomburst.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Toxicroak, Honchkrow, Donphan, Zygarde-10%, and Sneasel can KO Swellow with their priority moves, but they cannot switch into Boomburst.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Boomburst": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is the premier move for Swellow to use, as it can 2HKO almost all Pokemon in the tier that do not resist it. U-turn is very useful for Swellow, as opponents tend to switch to a Normal-resistant Pokemon when faced with it, allowing it to gain momentum for the team. Heat Wave, despite usually being very weak, is used to hit Escavalier, Bronzong, and Registeel, as they resist Boomburst. Air Slash can be used to OHKO Virizion, as well as Abomasnow prior to Mega Evolving, which can check it by virtue of Soundproof. Alternatively, if your team doesn't need Swellow to always revenge kill Virizion, Hidden Power Grass can be used in order to KO Rhyperior and hit most Rock-types like Diancie for at least some damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature maximizes Swellow's ability to break through teams while making it very fast. Choice Specs further complements Swellow's wallbreaking capabilities, and Scrappy allows Swellow to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Alolan Marowak with its powerful Boomburst.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main purpose for using Swellow is to be able to use Boomburst as often as possible. Due to this, Swellow can be used both as a wallbreaker and as a late-game cleaner due to its Speed and power. It should be used as a wallbreaker versus teams that have Steelix as the premier Steel-type and no bulky Rock-types like Gigalith and Rhyperior. However, if the opposing team has Normal-type checks, use U-turn in order to pivot out of them and switch to a Pokemon that fares well against those checks. Also, having entry hazards on the opposing field makes it easier for Swellow to wear its checks down, as most of them are grounded.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types like Machamp, Passimian, and Virizion are great partners for Swellow, as they can deal with Swellow's checks easily and break the opposing team or clean late-game. Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Tyrantrum, and Gardevoir appreciate Swellow weakening the team for them to clean. Drapion is also a useful teammate, as it can trap some of Swellow's checks such as Bronzong and Metagross, and heavily cripple Registeel with Knock Off.</p> <p>Defensively, Escavalier and Registeel are good teammates, as they can check Ice Shard users like Mega Glalie and Sneasel. In addition, Forretress, Roserade, and Dragalge complement Swellow's ability to break teams by providing Spikes support. Finally, Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Tsareena support Swellow by removing entry hazards, which hamper its potential. Since Swellow benefits from Spikes stacking, having a Rapid Spin user over a Defog user is recommended.</p>"

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Hariyama makes for a respectable tank thanks to its elephantine HP and access to Thick Fat, making it an ideal switch-in against Pokemon like Salazzle, Ninetales, and Mega Blastoise. Hariyama's Attack is also quite respectable, and it has the right coverage to hit everything in the tier for at least neutral damage, which makes switching into it difficult. However, Machamp is a major competitor for the same role, since it can act as a status absorber with Guts to boost its offensive potential. However, Hariyama has useful resistances thanks to Thick Fat and its slightly better special bulk. Hariyama is also worn down quickly by entry hazards, status, and repeatedly switching into resisted attacks thanks to its lack of reliable recovery. It is also slow and easily revenge killed by faster wallbreakers such as Bewear, Necrozma, and Noivern.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy Slam can OHKO Diancie, take out Gardevoir on the switch, and KO Florges after Stealth Rock, but it has little utility outside of these specific targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Noivern, Swellow, Honchkrow, and Golbat can threaten Hariyama out of the battle. However, they do not want to switch into Stone Edge or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Gardevoir, Diancie, and Florges take very little from Hariyama's attacks and can take it out with Moonblast. Diancie does not want to switch into Earthquake, however, and Gardevoir has to be careful of a potential Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Necrozma, Cresselia, and Slowbro can comfortably stomach Hariyama's moves outside of Knock Off and can force it out of battle with their STAB attacks, Toxic, or a Scald burn. Slowbro can also heal any damage dealt by switching out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Thanks to its low Speed, Hariyama is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Machamp, Bewear, and Tyrantrum if it has been weakened enough. However, these Pokemon do not want to risk switching into Hariyama.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Repeatedly switching into entry hazards and special attackers does wear down Hariyama thanks to its lack of reliable recovery. Status conditions also chip away at Hariyama's bulk. Toxic puts Hariyama on a timer, while being burned from Scald or Will-O-Wisp depletes its HP while also reducing its offensive presence.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Hariyama's strongest STAB move, but it comes with the cost of lowering its defenses. Knock Off can threaten Ghost and Psychic-types that attempt to switch in against Close Combat like Mismagius, Cresselia, and Alolan Marowak and remove items from bulky Pokemon like Registeel and Bronzong. Stone Edge and Earthquake form a combination that can hurt anything that resists Close Combat such as Golisopod, Noivern, Salazzle, Nidoqueen, and Diancie. Bullet Punch is a decent option to revenge kill weakened Pokemon like Gardevoir and Noivern.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given investment with an Assault Vest allows Hariyama to take hits from Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Salazzle, and Mega Blastoise while still outpacing uninvested Pokemon up to base 60 Speed like Tangela, Registeel, and Diancie. Thick Fat gives Hariyama extra resistances to Fire- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Arcanine, Raikou, and Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hariyama can use its sheer bulk to directly pivot into threatening special attackers such as Mega Blastoise, Raikou, and Mega Sceptile. It can also find opportunities to come in against Stealth Rock setters such as Registeel, Nidoqueen, and Bronzong as they set entry hazards, but it must be cautious of Toxic. Once in battle, Close Combat is generally a safe move to use because of its raw power and coverage, but be cautious of repeated uses, because it lowers Hariyama's defenses with each use. Knock Off is also a good move to use early- to mid-game, as it can cripple defensive checks such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Golbat, which makes these Pokemon less threatening late-game. Hariyama can usually force switches, so it would be wise to take advantage of that and go for a coverage move to possibly OHKO or 2HKO Pokemon like Noivern, Diancie, or Sigilyph. Hariyama is incredibly bulky, but make sure the battlefield is clear of entry hazards, as repeatedly switching into them wears down Hariyama. Additionally, keep Hariyama away from Knock Off, as it needs its Assault Vest to reliably pivot into special attackers. Finally, do not let it be inflicted with status, as Toxic will chip away at Hariyama's bulk every turn, and being burned from Scald lowers its offensive presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gardevoir is an ideal partner for Hariyama, since it can provide Healing Wish support if Hariyama has sustained prior damage. In return, Hariyama can threaten the Steel-, Dark-, and Fire-types that can take Gardevoir's STAB attacks. Pokemon like Virizion, Noivern, Flygon, and Mega Sceptile appreciate Hariyama's ability to act as a switch-in to Fire- and Ice-type moves. Noivern and Flygon can also safely bring Hariyama in safely with U-turn. Teammates like Registeel, Metagross, and Golisopod can help ease Hariyama's time against Psychic- and Fairy-types, while partners such as Raikou, Rhyperior, and Tyrantrum make dealing with Flying-types much easier. Entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Sigilyph can extend Hariyama's longevity by removing entry hazards that wear it down. Sigilyph can also switch into Toxic for Hariyama. A Z-Move user such as Virizion, Raikou, or Bewear or a Mega Evolution such as Mega Blastoise gives Hariyama a safety net against Knock Off, as it needs its Assault Vest in order to check special attackers.</p>"

Boasting a great STAB combination, Medicham is one of the hardest Pokemon to wall in the tier, having just a few safe counters, such as Cresselia and Uxie. Medicham makes up for its lackluster bulk of 60 / 75 / 75 with its great offensive presence and decent base 80 Speed stat, which allows it to Speed tie with Gardevoir and outspeed slower threats like Mega Blastoise and Tyrantrum. Alongside Medicham's STAB options, it has coverage such as Thunder Punch to deal with Flying-types and Slowbro, as well as Fake Out and Bullet Punch to pick off faster threats. However, its lack of defensive presence makes it hard to justify using over Fighting-types like Virizion, Bewear, and Toxicroak, which can offer useful resistances alongside their access to Swords Dance. Additionally, Pangoro and Machamp have raw power and can beat common Fighting-resistant Pokemon due to their access to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out can be used alongside Bullet Punch to chip faster threats with priority. Psycho Cut can also be used as a Psychic-type STAB move that is able to OHKO Bewear without a miss chance. Medicham can hold Choice Scarf to revenge kill a myriad of fast threats, such as Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, and Raikou.

Zen Headbutt acts as a secondary STAB option to deal with Ghost-types that are immune to High Jump Kick like Alolan Marowak and Mismagius. Thunder Punch is Medicham's best coverage option, hitting the likes of Slowbro and Mantine for super effective damage. Ice Punch can also be used to OHKO Noivern. Bullet Punch is a great priority option to KO Gardevoir after some chip damage, as well as finish off faster Pokemon should they take a huge hit from Medicham's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pure Power boosts Medicham's Attack stat to stellar levels and is essential for its wallbreaking capabilities. Life Orb further boosts the power of Medicham's moves and turns a lot of rolls into guaranteed OHKOs or 2HKOs. Maximum Speed and Attack investment is crucial to make Medicham harder to revenge kill and hit as hard as possible. Jolly is the nature of choice to outspeed the likes of Necrozma and Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When playing with Medicham, it should get as many opportunities to get safely into the field as possible by pivoting, double switching, or switching in after one of its partners is KOed by a slower opposing Pokemon. Medicham can put in work against both resilient and offensive builds due to its amazing power and decent Speed tier, so don't be afraid of punching holes with High Jump Kick or Zen Headbutt, since Medicham can usually hit the switch-in hard and KO it with another hit or with priority Bullet Punch. Be aware of Pokemon that usually run Protect, such as Bronzong and Registeel, which can force mind games against Medicham due to High Jump Kick's recoil damage upon failure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Faster Pokemon that can act as cleaners like Salazzle, Swellow, Zygarde-10%, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir greatly appreciate Medicham's ability to weaken and remove defensive threats from play so they can sweep easier. Volt Switch and U-turn support is a great way of bringing Medicham safely into the field to use its power effectively. The likes of Flygon, Rotom-C, and Raikou can fill this role and provide speed control or entry hazard removal. Since most of the Pokemon capable of resisting Medicham's STAB combination are Ghost- and Psychic-types, Pursuit trapping can be a great choice to deal with Pokemon such as Cresselia and Slowbro. Drapion and Escavalier can offer great offensive presence alongside Medicham and beat the few threats that Medicham has problems breaking through. Special attackers like Gardevoir and Espeon are nice teammates for Medicham that can overcome shared checks with coverage options such as Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball, luring out and KOing these Pokemon so Medicham can wallbreak more efficiently.</p>"

This is because unlike other bulky Water-types, Milotic isn't thwarted by status conditions thanks to Refresh, which, when combined with the move's high PP and Recover, allows Milotic to PP stall Pokemon that rely on status conditions to deal damage such as Registeel, Cresselia, and Porygon2. Milotic can also beat bulky setup sweepers such as Necrozma, Barbaracle, and Snorlax because of its access to Haze. Marvel Scale also helps with its niche, as it can allow Milotic to act as a status absorber and wall Pokemon like Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%. Unfortunately, Milotic's abilities don't aid it unless it outright walls certain Pokemon, and its low offensive output and Speed mean it is vulnerable to faster wallbreakers such as Virizion, Raikou, and Toxicroak and to Taunt users such as Noivern, Mandibuzz, and Mismagius. However, running Ice Beam does improve its matchup against Grass-types like Roserade and Mega Sceptile at the expense of being able to beat bulky offense teams. If Milotic chooses to forgo Refresh for Ice Beam, then it also becomes vulnerable to being worn down by status conditions more quickly. Milotic faces a lot of competition for a spot on a team; as a bulky Water-type, Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Mantine offer far superior utility by virtue of their typings, abilities, and access to Defog in Mantine's case, and as a status absorber, Machamp is far less passive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Tail could be used instead of Haze to offensively combat setup sweepers and has better synergy with entry hazards. However, Dragon Tail has less PP and has a chance to miss, which makes Haze the better choice. Competitive gives Milotic a method to beat Defog users and Sticky Web teams, but it misses out on Marvel Scale's defensive utility. Flame Orb can give Milotic an immediate Marvel Scale boost, but this is not recommended because it misses out on the passive recovery of Leftovers, and the need to use Recover more often invites more wallbreakers into battle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Noivern, and Mismagius can threaten Milotic out of battle simply by using Taunt, which leaves Milotic with few options to retaliate against them. Noivern can also further cripple Milotic by using Switcheroo to give it a Choice Scarf. Other Trick users like Gardevoir and Espeon also threaten Milotic.</p> <p><strong>Scald-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Virizion, Dragalge, and Slowking can easily threaten Milotic out of battle thanks to their resistance to Scald. Despite having the type advantage, Virizion does have to worry about being burned and switching into Ice Beam. Machamp can easily switch into Scald and gain a Guts boost from the burn. Toxicroak is especially dangerous, since it is immune to Scald thanks to Dry Skin and can easily set up against Milotic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Raikou can easily force Milotic out of battle and begin setting up with Substitute and Calm Mind. Other Pokemon like Modest Nidoqueen and Choice Specs Goodra can carry Electric-type coverage moves to beat Milotic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Mega Sceptile can pivot into Milotic and threaten it out of battle. They all can be threatened by Ice Beam, however.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: If Milotic runs Ice Beam over Refresh, it cannot combat status conditions as well. Even if Milotic runs Refresh, it still has to use a turn to get rid of poison from Toxic, which can give the foe an opportunity to take advantage of it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic improves Milotic's matchups against Mandibuzz, Araquanid, and Slowbro, while Haze can be used to beat setup Pokemon such as Sigilyph, Necrozma, and Zygarde-10%. Refresh allows Milotic to potentially beat more passive Pokemon like Registeel, Porygon2, and Bronzong thanks to the move's high PP. Ice Beam is a decent alternative to Refresh to improve Milotic's offensive output and chip away at Scald-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile, Noivern, and Toxicroak at the expense of Refresh's high PP and ability to beat bulky Pokemon. It's important to note that Milotic's moveset is incredibly flexible and can be customized to fit what its team needs.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Milotic to avoid a 2HKO from Nidoqueen's Thunderbolt and Necrozma's +1 Photon Geyser as well as an OHKO from +2 Salazzle's Acid Downpour and Barbaracle's Continental Crush and makes it safer to stay in against Mega Blastoise in case Dark Pulse makes Milotic flinch. Marvel Scale allows Milotic to gain a Defense boost in case it is afflicted by a status condition, which can make it harder to take down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Milotic should use its bulk to pivot into Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Metagross, Nidoqueen, Gardevoir, and Goodra. Afterwards, it can force out setup sweepers like Necrozma, Salazzle, and Barbaracle with Haze or the threat of a Scald burn. Be cautious with this play, because some of these Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Goodra, and Gardevoir can carry super effective coverage against Milotic, and Metagross and Gardevoir could just as easily threaten Milotic with Trick. Milotic can also easily pivot into bulky Pokemon like Registeel, Porygon2, and Cresselia and Scald users such as Slowbro, Mantine, and Gastrodon to gain a Defense boost from the status conditions they afflict. It can even PP stall these Pokemon by spamming Refresh due to the move's absurdly high PP. Use Ice Beam to pressure Grass- and Dragon-types, Toxicroak, and certain Defog users like Mandibuzz so that your team's entry hazards can stay on the field longer. Keep Milotic as healthy as possible so that it can beat the Pokemon it needs to. This means keeping Milotic away from Toxic if you choose to forgo Refresh, because its longevity will diminish over time despite the boost from Marvel Scale. Milotic is extremely passive, so it should avoid Taunt users such as Mandibuzz, Noivern, and Mismagius at all costs. Running Ice Beam does improve its matchup against Noivern and Mandibuzz, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Milotic can fit on more defensive teams that need a solid wall, a status absorber, and a method to beat setup sweepers. A check to Grass- and Electric-types such as Noivern, Ninetales, and Nidoqueen is generally appreciated to give Milotic an easier time pivoting into offensive Pokemon. Other offensive Pokemon like Gardevoir, Necrozma, and Sigilyph can help Milotic combat Machamp and Toxicroak, two Pokemon that give it some trouble. Physically offensive Pokemon such as Golisopod, Virizion, and Bewear pair well with Milotic, as it can act as a check to Scald users for them. Golisopod in particular can benefit from Milotic's ability to threaten spinners like Donphan and Mega Blastoise, as well as target threatening Defog users like Mandibuzz and Sigilyph with Ice Beam to keep its Spikes on the field longer. Defensive teammates such as Slowbro, Porygon2, and Cresselia greatly appreciate Milotic's Haze support to prevent setup sweepers from quickly overwhelming them. They also love Milotic's ability to absorb status conditions to give them a much easier time walling offensive threats, and in return they can wall Pokemon that Milotic cannot alone such as Zygarde-10%, Tyrantrum, and Machamp.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Between its powerful Refrigerate-boosted STAB attacks and various coverage moves, Mega Glalie is a difficult Pokemon to switch into in the RU tier. It acts as an aggressive Spikes setter, as it forces many switches, that give it the opportunity to set Spikes layers up, and it threatens common entry hazard controllers such as Donphan and Mandibuzz by virtue of its strong STAB attacks. Mega Glalie also sports an above average base 100 Speed, allowing it to outpace and threaten a large number of threats in the metagame, including Roserade and Honchkrow, and threaten them with its STAB attacks. Glalie also has access to the valuable STAB Ice Shard, which allows it to pick off a number of threats in the tier, such as Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%, Noivern, and Chlorophyll Venusaur, which can be hard to revenge kill. However, a terrible defensive typing and only average bulk leave Mega Glalie unable to switch in on much and forced out by a number of faster offensive threats, and a weakness to Stealth Rock combined with a main STAB move that causes recoil makes it so that Glalie's time on the field is often short. Finally, Glalie's coverage moves leave a bit to be desired, as they often fail to net 2HKOs on their targets, causing Glalie to be forced out and potentially take more hazard damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Return can be used over Double-Edge to mitigate recoil, but the drop in power is very noticeable. Facade can be used to make Glalie less susceptible to Burn, but is much too weak as a primary STAB attack and isn't worth using over coverage or utility moves. Freeze-Dry 2HKOes Slowbro, Mantine, and Mega Blastoise, while guaranteeing an OHKO on Seismitoad; however, most targets of Freeze-Dry are already 2HKOed by Double-Edge, such as the aforementioned Mantine and Seismitoad, and other Water-types such as Milotic and Vaporeon are not 2HKOed by Freeze-Dry regardless. Taunt is an option in the last slot to deny recovery from switch-ins or make Pokemon such as Registeel setup bait for a teammate. Hidden Power Fire can be used over Earthquake or Super Fang to snipe Escavalier, though this makes Glalie weaker versus more specially bulky targets and bulky Fire-types. If using a special attack such as Freeze-Dry or Hidden Power Fire, a Naive nature is recommended, as it preserves Glalie's Speed tier without weakening any of Glalie’s attacks. Crunch hits Bronzong for more damage than Glalie's other options, but generally it isn't worth the moveslot because it still often misses the 2HKO and reduces Glalie's effectiveness versus other Ice-resistant Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ice-resistant Pokemon</strong>: As Glalie often only uses Earthquake as coverage, bulky Pokemon that resist Ice and can stomach an Earthquake such as Slowbro and Thick Fat Snorlax switch into Glalie with ease. However, it is worth noting that many of Glalie's switch-ins either have no recovery and can be worn down over time or give Glalie room to set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Given Glalie's poor defensive typing and only average defenses, many threats that outpace it and don't fear Ice Shard such as Salazzle threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Glalie's weakness to Stealth Rock, susceptibility to Spikes, and recoil-causing primary STAB attack all cause it to be worn down very quickly.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Mega Glalie's strongest STAB attack due to Refrigerate, and thanks to its power combined with Ice's fantastic offensive coverage, it is capable of 2HKOing a large portion of the tier. Ice Shard allows Glalie to hit faster threats and pick off weakened opponents, and is one of the most reliable ways to offensively check notable threats to offensive teams such as Flygon, Swellow, and Venusaur. Earthquake allows Glalie to do more damage to Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Registeel and Arcanine. Super Fang can be used instead to allow Glalie to shave off half of the HP of switch-ins such as Bronzong, Registeel, and Milotic, allowing a teammate or Glalie itself to break through them with more ease later on. The last slot is mostly team-dependent. Spikes lets Glalie support its team by dealing chip damage to grounded foes, wearing down the opposing team more quickly. Glalie uses its powerful Ice-type STAB moves to threaten foes out to safely set Spikes up, and it also threatens hazard clearers, making sure its Spikes stay on the field. Explosion can be used as a last-ditch effort to deal huge damage to a foe once Glalie has done what it needs to do. The move can take out Pokemon that would usually wall it—for example, Double-Edge + Explosion 2HKOes Porygon2, Cresselia, and Escavalier, which would comfortably take a Double-Edge by itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is used as to keep Glalie's above average Speed tier intact, outpacing threats such as Roserade and Sigilyph. An Adamant nature could be used to boost Glalie's power, though it has the significant drawback of causing Glalie to be outsped by anything faster than base 86 Speed with a positive nature, such as the aforementioned threats. Glalie's choice of legal abilities prior to Mega Evolution isn't particularly relevant, as it should be Mega Evolving as soon as possible. However, Inner Focus is preferred, as it could come in handy should Glalie need to bypass the effects of a weak Fake Out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Glalie's main merit lies in its incredibly powerful primary STAB move, Double-Edge, so that should often be the move it uses first. Use Glalie's coverage to pressure Pokemon that resist Double-Edge to create holes in the opposition for its teammates to exploit. Set up Spikes on predicted switches to foes Glalie can't deal significant damage to in order to help wear down the opposing team, and use the threat of its STAB attacks to deter hazard clearers. As Glalie has a poor defensive typing and only average bulk, it should usually be paired with U-turn or Volt Switch users to get it on the field. Make sure to keep entry hazards off the field, as they, in combination with Double-Edge recoil, can cause Glalie to be worn down very quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primary teammates for Glalie are those that use its wallbreaking power and the support it can provide with Spikes to clean the opposing team after it has been weakened, such as Salazzle and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Good teammates for Glalie also include those that appreciate Spikes support to help them break walls themselves, like Swellow and Choice Band Escavalier. Similarly, partners such as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Metagross are appreciated, as Glalie is often forced to switch out versus Steel-types that they can beat. Due to Glalie's Ice typing, it is susceptible to entry hazards, especially since it takes recoil damage from its primary STAB move. Therefore, having teammates that provide hazard control such as Mantine, Donphan, and Tsareena is essential, though it is worth noting that Defog does not synergize well with Spikes. Again because of its Ice typing, Glalie is unable to switch into much and relies on Volt Switch and U-turn support from teammates like Uxie and Raikou to get on the field.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross is the premier offensive Steel-type in RU thanks to its excellent offensive stats and defensive typing. Its amazing versatility makes it quite hard to accurately predict its set, being able to fulfill several niches such as Stealth Rock setter, wallbreaker, sweeper, and revenge killer. Incorrectly predicting what set it is running can allow Metagross to utilize the free turns to wallbreak or set up. This is further exemplified by its ability to run several coverage moves. Meteor Mash's chance to boost its Attack can leave would-be counters such as Bronzong, Milotic, and Tangela insufficient after slight chip damage, while its great coverage options limit the number of checks that can switch into it; however, they also leave Metagross with a bad case of four-moveslot syndrome. On one hand, Metagross's base 70 Speed stat allows it to outspeed common nuisances to bulky offense teams, such as Bewear and Pangoro, but on the other hand, it leaves it extremely vulnerable to Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Nidoqueen, and Necrozma. Although it has few weaknesses, most of them are very common and easily exploit Metagross. For example, Metagross's weakness to Dark means it can be easily trapped and removed from play by Pokemon such as Drapion, Escavalier, and Honchkrow, while its Fire-type weakness can leave it setup fodder against Ninetales and Salazzle. Even though Meteor Mash is a great STAB move, Steel is a mediocre offensive typing, being resisted by common Water-, Steel-, and Fire-types such as Milotic, Slowbro, Forretress, Arcanine, and Ninetales. Metagross does have coverage for most of them, but it is left very prediction reliant on teams with several Steel-resistant Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt is an option that provides decent neutral coverage and is able to heavily damage Pokemon like Seismitoad and take out most Fighting-types such as Bewear and Machamp while still hitting most Thunder Punch targets decently hard. However, it does leave Metagross more vulnerable to Water-types that are able to take a Zen Headbutt, like Milotic and Slowbro. Electrium Z lets Metagross break common switch-ins such as Mandibuzz, Milotic, and Slowbro, although it sorely misses the utility or power that its other items grant it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Mega Blastoise can switch into Metagross's Steel STAB attacks with ease and threaten it out with Scald or Dark Pulse. However, most of them take a lot of damage from either Explosion or Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Salazzle and Ninetales can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf sets with ease and switch into every move bar Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type coverage</strong>: Fast Mandibuzz can switch into every set with ease as long as Metagross doesn't click Explosion and proceed to cripple it with Knock Off or outright KO it with Foul Play. Slower variants can check it, although it is unable to switch into most sets as easily as faster variants can. Honchkrow is able to revenge kill it with Sucker Punch after some slight chip damage. Drapion and Escavalier can threaten it with Knock Off or trap it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Many Ground-types in RU like Donphan, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior can take a hit and heavily damage non-Shuca Berry variants of Metagross. However, they must be wary of Meteor Mash boosts, Explosion, and Shuca Berry.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is a powerful STAB move and has a useful chance to boost Attack, which can let Metagross overwhelm regular checks such as Tangela, Milotic, and Rhyperior. Earthquake boasts almost unresisted coverage alongside Meteor Mash, hitting Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-types such as Arcanine, Registeel, and Mega Ampharos super effectively. Toxic lets Metagross cripple defensive checks such as non-Refresh Milotic and Slowbro, notably being the only option that can cripple Mandibuzz. Explosion is an option on hyper offense, letting Metagross blow up a counter or a fast threat such as Milotic or Noivern so another member of the team can sweep without having to worry about them. Bullet Punch can pick off faster Fairy- and Rock-types such as Slurpuff, Gardevoir, and Aerodactyl, as well as KOing very weakened threats. It can even allow Metagross to clean up offensive teams if it gets enough Meteor Mash boosts. Thunder Punch allows Metagross to hit bulky Water-types such as Mantine, Milotic, and Mega Blastoise on the switch. Pursuit lets Metagross switch into and remove Pokemon such as Espeon and Choice Scarf Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread lets Metagross outspeed Adamant Bewear, Pangoro, and Mantine while maximizing its offensive presence. The remaining EVs go into HP to increase its bulk. Shuca Berry allows it to take Ground-type moves from the likes of Nidoqueen, Zygarde-10%, Rhyperior, and Tyrantrum and check them. Alternatively, Custap Berry lets it fire off a powerful Explosion even against faster threats once its HP drops below 25%. This is particularly useful on hyper offense builds, which appreciate the extra momentum and weakening or removing of a single threat at the expense of Metagross's life. Clear Body lets it have a decent matchup against Sticky Web teams and prevents stat drops from moves such as Psychic or Seed Flare. A Colbur Berry is a decent option to prevent being Pursuit trapped by the likes of Escavalier and Honchkrow and to take Dark-type coverage from Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise and Tsareena. Running an Iapapa Berry improves Metagross's longevity, making it a consistent switch-in to the likes of Gardevoir throughout the whole match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Metagross's excellent defensive typing and bulk to pivot into threats it walls, such as Gardevoir, Tyrantrum, Snorlax, Vanilluxe, and Mega Abomasnow, using them as fodder to set up Stealth Rock early in the match. Once Stealth Rock is up, Metagross is free to dish out powerful attacks or fish for Meteor Mash boosts to wallbreak. Don't rely too much on Metagross as your only switch-in to these Pokemon, however, as its lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down. Only use Explosion once Metagross isn't needed anymore and Pokemon such as Gardevoir are dealt with. Use it to blow up a Pokemon that counters one of Metagross's teammates so it can sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shuca Berry Metagross is an excellent offensive glue, being able to provide Stealth Rock, a wide array of resistances, and good offensive presence. This means it easily fits on many offensive and bulky offensive teams. Therefore, many offense staples like Roserade do well with Metagross. Pokemon that are able to beat bulky Water-types, such as Machamp and Toxicroak, pair well with Metagross. Additionally, they can pressure Steel-types like Forretress. Pokemon that are walled by Fairy-types, like Goodra and Mega Blastoise, appreciate Metagross's ability to switch in and scare them away. In return, they can pressure Fire-type Pokemon and wear down bulky Water-types like Araquanid.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is a high-powered STAB move with a useful chance to boost Metagross's Attack, allowing it to break through common counters with some luck. Earthquake provides coverage against Fire- and Steel-types like Arcanine and Registeel. Thunder Punch lets Metagross damage bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic. Bullet Punch lets Metagross clean teams once they are sufficiently weakened and circumvent its mediocre Speed stat. It also helps against weakened threats such as Noivern or Virizion. Pursuit is an option that lets Metagross switch into and remove Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Espeon, while Explosion's high power lets it break common switch-ins to Metagross like Slowbro and provides extra momentum. Trick lets Metagross cripple a usual counter such as fast Mandibuzz without going down like with Explosion, although it leaves Metagross a lot less powerful. Hammer Arm hits Normal-types such as Bewear and Porygon2 without having to hope for a Meteor Mash boost while still hitting most Earthquake targets, notably allowing Metagross to always switch into and beat CurseLax, although the Speed-lowering effect can leave Metagross vulnerable to slower threats like Pangoro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band is a necessity to increase Metagross's wallbreaking abilities. Clear Body gives it a decent matchup against Sticky Web teams and prevents random stat drops from moves such as Bug Buzz. An Adamant nature gives Metagross more power, although Jolly is an option to outspeed Pokemon like Cresselia and Tyrantrum.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Metagross's wide array of resistances to switch it into Pokemon it walls and dish out powerful attacks. Be aware that Metagross's main STAB attack can give many free turns to Pokemon that resist Steel, such as Ninetales and Raikou. Thus, try to predict when the opponent might try to bring them in, and smack them with the appropriate coverage move. Bullet Punch should only be used against weakened threats, as it can leave Metagross setup fodder to many threatening pokemon like Necrozma and Barbaracle. Similarly, avoid using Explosion unless Metagross is no longer needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metagross is a wallbreaker with good defensive utility, so teams that need a hard-hitting switch-in to Fairy-, Flying-, and Rock-type Pokemon will appreciate Choice Band Metagross. VoltTurn support from the likes of Mega Ampharos and Passimian lets Metagross switch in with ease and threaten the Pokemon that switch into them. Choice Band Metagross is able to deal with its usual counters better than other sets can thanks to its sheer power, although because it is still reliant on prediction, it appreciates teammates that remove usual roadblocks to it like Water- and Fire-types.</p>"

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility increases Metagross's lacking Speed stat to high levels, enabling it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir. Meteor Mash is Metagross's main STAB move and has a nifty chance to boost its Attack, allowing it to bypass common counters like Donphan with luck. Earthquake hits Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon that might try to check Metagross, like Arcanine, Registeel, and Mega Ampharos. Thunder Punch nails Water-type switch-ins like Mega Blastoise and Milotic, although it lacks the power to take out bulkier Pokemon like Slowbro. Explosion can let Metagross KO Pokemon that would otherwise check it like Mandibuzz and Milotic at the expense of its own life.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb powers up its moves, allowing it to deal consistent damage and boosting Explosion and Thunder Punch, which allows it to bypass its usual counters like Mandibuzz and Milotic. Weakness Policy can be run to power up its attacks significantly, although activating it leaves Metagross very weakened and vulnerable to revenge killing. Clear Body can allow it to sweep Sticky Web teams if it is able to set up. An Adamant nature provides Metagross with more power, notably letting it OHKO Milotic with a Life Orb-boosted Explosion after Stealth Rock, although a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Shaymin and Flygon as well as Choice Scarf Houndoom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Metagross has many good setup opportunities, make sure to conserve it until its counters are taken out or weakened enough for it to sweep. Explosion sets should be used more as a wallbreaker, luring in and heavily weakening or outright KOing usual switch-ins to other common Metagross sets. This can allow other teammates to set up a sweep with far less difficulty. This set can bluff the more common Shuca Berry set if running Weakness Policy, which can allow Metagross to even set up on Pokemon such as Flygon and Zygarde-10%. Although Metagross isn't very weak to the usual forms of priority like Extreme Speed and Ice Shard, it should still be wary of Sucker Punch from the likes of Toxicroak, Honchkrow, and Lycanroc-D and Golisopod’s First Impression, all of which can weaken it or KO it if sufficiently weakened. Also, even weak priority can KO Metagross if it is low on health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Arcanine and Machamp that dislike Water- and Flying-types appreciate Metagross's ability to lure them in and KO them with a Life Orb-boosted Explosion. Many of Metagross's counters do not have reliable recovery. As a result, entry hazards from the likes of Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Golisopod can help it KO targets like Forretress. Pokemon that can help Metagross set up through their use of double screens, VoltTurn support, and Yawn are important to maximize its chances of setting up. Therefore, Pokemon like Electrode, Flygon, and Uxie make for great partners.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is Metagross's main STAB move and can allow it to get past its counters with some luck thanks to a nifty chance to boost its Attack. Zen Headbutt is a secondary STAB move that allows Metagross to OHKO Virizion as well as deal neutral damage on Fire- and Water-type Pokemon that resist Meteor Mash. Earthquake hits Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-types that might want to switch into its other moves, like Ninetales, opposing Metagross, and Raikou. Trick can cripple a bulky wall such as Snorlax or Bronzong, severely reducing their effectiveness. Explosion can be used on more offensive builds to dispose of a threat once Metagross is no longer needed. Thunder Punch nails bulky Water-types like Mega Blastoise and Vaporeon, as well as hitting fast Mandibuzz slightly stronger than Meteor Mash. Ice Punch can reliably revenge kill Noivern and Grass-types like Virizion, although they're already hit hard by Meteor Mash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf boosts Metagross's mediocre Speed stat, allowing it to revenge kill several threats like Salazzle, Swellow, and Virizion. Clear Body can help it combat Sticky Web teams and avoids annoying stat drops from moves like Psychic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Metagross has a much better matchup against offensive teams, having limited switch-ins outside of Pokemon such as a well-played Arcanine or Raikou. Although it has the coverage to KO most offensive Pokemon, once it is locked into a move it cannot take advantage of its movepool. Thus, try to predict when the opponent might send out a Pokemon that resists Steel, and hit it with the appropriate coverage move or double switch out to a teammate that can handle it. Metagross's vulnerability to Pursuit can leave it unable to KO more than one threat if a Pokemon such as Escavalier, Honchkrow, or Drapion is on the opposing team. Thus, make sure to gauge when it's appropriate to revenge kill a threat. Trick can cripple opposing Pokemon like Mandibuzz, but be wary of using it until all fast threats like Salazzle are dealt with. Similarly, Explosion can KO a threat to the team, but only do so once Metagross isn't needed anymore. After Pokemon that wall Metagross like Slowbro and Milotic are dealt with, Metagross should attempt to clean the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite its Speed boost, Choice Scarf Metagross is unable to outspeed fast threats like Aerodactyl and Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%. Additionally, it is slower than all other viable Choice Scarf users like Salazzle, Raikou, and Goodra, meaning its teammates must have a way to combat these type of Pokemon; this makes partners such as Slowbro and Porygon2 ideal. Pokemon that can threaten Water-, Fire-, and Steel-types can make using Metagross far less prediction reliant. These include Pokemon like Roserade, Zygarde-10%, and Araquanid. Wallbreakers like Toxicroak and Choice Specs Goodra can pave the way for Metagross to clean the opposing team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Registeel's bulk lets it easily wall many specially offensive Pokemon in the tier like Diancie, Shaymin, and Swellow while serving as a blanket check to many Pokemon that can only hit it neutrally, especially with special attacks. This, in tandem with access to helpful utility moves such as Stealth Rock, also allows it to be a very consistent entry hazard setter. Registeel can also cripple opposing Pokemon with status without ever being overly passive, as it can stall with Protect and Toxic and deal solid damage with Seismic Toss. On the other hand, its typing means that it is weak to the ever-common Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types, specifically being pressured by Salazzle and Zygarde-10% with their super effective STAB moves. In addition, it is susceptible to Taunt, which makes it susceptible to Pokemon like Noivern and Mismagius.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster threats like Salazzle and Metagross on the switch, but, as a consequence, Registeel becomes more passive, as it loses out on the damage from Toxic, becoming unable to do anything to a status-afflicted Ghost-type.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxic-Immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon immune to Toxic, such as Escavalier, Metagross, have an easy time switching into Registeel and threaten to set up and hit it with Earthquake, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Rhyperior, and Zygarde-10% can all 2HKO Registeel with their Ground-type STAB moves or start setting up on a predicted switch out. Ground-type coverage such as Earthquake from Mega Abomasnow can also damage it sufficiently.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Salazzle, Arcanine, and Houndoom can all heavily damage Registeel with their powerful Fire-type STAB moves, and Ninetales can OHKO it using Inferno Overdrive boosted by Drought. However, Fire-types don't like taking Stealth Rock damage, and they dislike being crippled by status.</p> <p><strong>Fighting types</strong>: Virizion, Toxicroak, Bewear, and Pangoro can all heavily damage or cleanly OHKO Registeel with their respective STAB moves, depending on the Pokemon's set or chip damage, and can force it out very easily. None like Thunder Wave, but Virizion can potentially shut it down with Taunt, and Pangoro may hold a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Mismagius and Noivern can completely shut down Registeel, forcing it out or leaving it incapable of doing anything but using Seismic Toss.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismic Toss does a solid 100 HP of damage to anything that isn't a Ghost-type, allowing Registeel to dish out decent damage or break Substitutes of Pokemon that may try to set up on it. Toxic is used in tandem with Seismic Toss to whittle down the array of bulky Pokemon in the tier such as Porygon2, Slowbro, and Umbreon. Stealth Rock is mandatory to pressure Pokemon switching in while breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy, making teammates have an easier time cleaning up late-game. Protect has a multitude of uses, such as stalling for extra damage from Toxic and recovery from Leftovers, scouting for Choice items, and cushioning Z-Moves that may otherwise outright KO Registeel. Earthquake can be used to KO the Fire-types Registeel lures in such as Salazzle, which may try to set up Nasty Plot, expecting you to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 252 EVs in HP and Special Defense along with a Calm nature maximizes Registeel's special bulk. Leftovers is used to mitigate Registeel's lack of recovery and help it stay out for longer on the field. Clear Body is chosen to avoid stray stat drops from moves such as Shadow Ball and Psychic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock should be set up as early as possible to start racking up chip damage, heavily damaging Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-type Pokemon such as Ninetales, Salazzle, and Yanmega, limiting their use in play. Switch Registeel into foes that cannot do much to it, such as Dragalge, Florges, Cresselia, and Diancie, in order to force them out, allowing it to get Stealth Rock up or take advantage of status. However, be wary of super effective coverage moves such as Focus Blast from Gardevoir and Hidden Power Fire from Roserade, as, despite Registeel's special bulk, it will still take a measurable chunk of damage from them. While it can take neutral physical hits fairly well, do not switch Registeel into them too often, as lack of Defense investment along with no recovery outside of Leftovers means it will get worn down fairly fast. Make use of Protect to stall out turns of Toxic damage along with PP and to heal with Leftovers while scouting for possible Choice items, but do not overuse it, as it may lead to free switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia, Noivern, and Golbat are all good checks to Fighting-types, with the latter helping Registeel's longevity by removing entry hazards with Defog, while Cresselia can deal with Pokemon like Salazzle and Virizion slightly better. Umbreon provides Wish and Heal Bell support, upping Registeel's longevity while serving as a check to Nidoqueen. Araquanid is a more offensive partner, but due to its resistances to all of Registeel's weaknesses and Water Bubble, it can come in on a wide variety of moves that threaten it and can often force their users out or outright KO them, while Registeel supports it by taking the Flying-, Rock-, and special Electric-type moves that it fears.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra carves itself a niche in the tier by providing Stealth Rock support and acting as a solid check to top metagame threats like Zygarde-10%, Barbaracle, Tyrantrum, and Metagross thanks to its typing, reliable recovery, and solid bulk. However, although Torterra has a decent Attack stat and access to strong STAB moves, it struggles to make much headway with Flying-types such as Noivern and Mandibuzz, Grass-types like Shaymin and Virizion, and other defensive threats like Bronzong all being extremely common in the tier. Torterra's performance as a Stealth Rock setter is somewhat lackluster at times due to the fact that it's forced out by Mega Blastoise and just flat-out can't do anything to common Defoggers in Mandibuzz and Sigilyph. Though Torterra's defensive typing definitely has its boons, it leaves Torterra with crippling weaknesses to Flying, Fire, and Ice. This along with its mediocre Special Defense means it's absolute food for prominent Pokemon like Ninetales, Noivern, Arcanine, and Mega Abomasnow. Additionally, it cannot switch into Scald due to the potential of being crippled by a burn, which is a big issue for a Grass-type. Nonetheless, Torterra can provide useful role compression to a team, being a sturdy Stealth Rock setter able to check threatening Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Barbaracle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is a decent option if Torterra's team already has a Stealth Rock user. It allows Torterra to act as a decent breaker; however, its poor Speed means it is easily forced out by Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Ninetales, and Noivern. 36 Speed EVs can be run on this set in order to outspeed Porygon2, which usually carries Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Torterra's STAB combination is totally walled by Grass-types like Virizion and Shaymin that can comfortably switch into and take advantage of it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-types like Ninetales and Arcanine resist Wood Hammer and threaten Torterra with their super effective STAB moves in return. Both should be wary of Earthquake, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Similarly to Grass-type Pokemon, Torterra is unable to deal any significant damage to Flying-type Pokemon like Noivern and Mandibuzz, both of which can force it out and even freely remove Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Ice-types like Mega Abomasnow and Cloyster easily OHKO Torterra with their STAB moves, with the former being able to directly switch into Torterra. Similarly, Pokemon like Mega Blastoise and Raikou that run Ice-type coverage can break through Torterra with ease.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from Toxic, burn, and entry hazards wears down Torterra rapidly, forcing it to use up more of its already sparse Synthesis PP and putting it in range of attacks it wouldn't be in range of otherwise, leaving it unable to do its job properly.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is mandatory on every competitive team, and Torterra is a decent user of the move thanks to its durability. Wood Hammer threatens bulky Water- and Ground-types like Milotic, Seismitoad, and Flygon and notably OHKOes Zygarde-10% if boosted by Overgrow, allowing Torterra to effectively check it. Earthquake is Torterra's secondary STAB move and has good coverage alongside Wood Hammer, threatening Steel-types like Registeel and Metagross and Fire-types like Arcanine and Ninetales. Synthesis allows Torterra to continually check Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Barbaracle, and Metagross throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is run to help Torterra check physical threats like Zygarde-10%, Barbaracle, and Metagross. Overgrow means Wood Hammer hits incredibly hard when Torterra is weakened, in particular allowing it to OHKO Zygarde-10%. Leftovers gives Torterra some passive recovery so it isn't forced to heal up with Synthesis as often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stealth Rock should be set up early-game against Pokemon that are forced out by or fail to threaten Torterra such as Metagross, Barbaracle, and Zygarde-10% locked into Thousand Arrows in order to chip down Torterra's Flying- and Fire-type checks, namely Noivern, Mandibuzz, and Arcanine. Synthesis should be used semi-regularly against Pokemon that Torterra forces out in matchups where it needs to be healthy enough to check the aforementioned threats. Additionally, Wood Hammer shouldn't be used too liberally, as the recoil will force Torterra to waste Synthesis's already sparse PP. Avoid letting Torterra get hit with status, namely burn and poison, as they will severely hinder it by reducing its longevity and, in burn's case, significantly hurt its offensive presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torterra fits best on bulkier offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to check troublesome Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Barbaracle. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Mantine are great partners for Torterra, as they help to cover Torterra's Fire and Ice weaknesses. Torterra is worn down heavily by Spikes, so entry hazard removers like Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, and the aforementioned Mantine are very useful. Steel-types like Registeel and Bronzong appreciate Torterra checking Zygarde-10%, and in turn, they check Pokemon like Roserade, Gardevoir, Swellow, and, in Bronzong's case, Mega Abomasnow. Lastly, Torterra invites Flying-types like Noivern and Mandibuzz, so Pokemon that can take advantage of them like Tyrantrum and Raikou are great teammates.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Powerful STAB moves, potent coverage, and high versatility make Roserade RU's premier Spiker. Said versatility gives Roserade the means to potentially beat almost any entry hazard remover, including the best spinner in Mega Blastoise, and its offensive prowess forces many switches that further ease setting Spikes. Sludge Bomb and Technician-boosted Hidden Power can cover almost anything that could hope to take Leaf Storm, including Flying-types, Fire-types, and Steel-types; this makes Roserade a problem for frail, offensive teams and slow, bulky teams alike. A Grass / Poison typing gives Roserade the resistances to switch into Water-types and check a fair number of foes in a pinch as well. With Hidden Power Fire, Sleep Powder, and multiple items to choose from, Roserade can be tough to predict and consistently switch into. However, relative frailty keeps Roserade from switching in on many foes that aren't passive or Water type, and even then, it needs Synthesis to consistently answer Water-types. Poor bulk also makes Roserade easy to pick off or revenge kill, and though its Speed is decent, it falls short of major threats such as Ninetales. Roserade experiences moveslot issues, as it wants both Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power to hit as many foes as possible and Synthesis to stick around longer, not to mention Sleep Powder, but can only fit two of these moves. It faces some competition from fellow Grass-types Shaymin and Virizion, which boast a Ground resistance as well as greater Speed and bulk. Unique access to Spikes and Technician Hidden Power keeps Roserade relevant, though.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Focus Sash set guarantees a use of Spikes, eliminates the need for Synthesis, and makes running Sleep Powder easier, but it reduces Roserade's offensive potential. Roserade's decent attack options and average Speed make it sound like an effective Choice Scarf user, but it suffers from extremely exploitable STAB moves. Grassium Z Roserade can throw out a powerful Grass-type attack without lowering its Special Attack, but it fails to hit as many potential checks as Poisonium Z sets. Other attack options include Grass Knot, which lets Roserade pressure Mantine and avoid Special Attack drops at the expense of consistent damage, and Hidden Power Ice, which threatens many of Acid Downpour's targets without requiring a Z-Crystal but is useless against Steel-types, unlike Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mantine and specially defensive Mandibuzz can remove Spikes and easily take any of Roserade's attacks outside of Acid Downpour. Cresselia and Porygon2 are also too bulky for Roserade to beat single-handedly. None of them like getting poisoned by Sludge Bomb, though, and Mantine struggles with Sleep Powder variants.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragalge and Goodra take Roserade's attacks pretty comfortably, though they can get worn down quickly. Noivern can switch into the standard Life Orb set and threaten an easy KO but is OHKOed by Acid Downpour.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Salazzle can switch into any attack and force Roserade out. It's too frail to switch in more than twice and takes major damage from Acid Downpour, however. Alolan Marowak is slower but resists all of Roserade's common moves.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Most attackers with priority moves or higher Speed, including Golisopod, Zygarde-10%, and Ninetales, have no trouble OHKOing or 2HKOing Roserade.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roserade's ability to force switches gives it plenty of chances to use Spikes. Leaf Storm's power is necessary for threatening most relevant Water-types with an OHKO. It also deals hefty damage to anything that isn't both bulky and Grass resistant. Sludge Bomb is a reliable and decently strong STAB move that pressures Leaf Storm switch-ins like Mandibuzz, Noivern, and Goodra. Technician-boosted Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types for major damage. Synthesis allows Roserade to switch into Water-types more freely and get multiple Spikes layers against passive walls like Registeel but limits it to two attacks. Sleep Powder is an option to make setting Spikes against slower foes even easier and can create setup opportunities for teammates, but it's difficult to fit and misses often.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Roserade's offensive nature makes maximum Special Attack and Speed investment optimal. It needs a Timid nature to stay ahead of the common Speed tiers just below it. Life Orb gives Roserade's attacks even greater potency, an the recoil doesn't matter much thanks to Roserade's already lacking bulk. Poisonium Z can be used to nuke common switch-ins and give Roserade a bit more staying power, but teammates will often want a Z-Crystal more. Technician should always be used when running Hidden Power to strengthen it; otherwise, Natural Cure is optimal for removing Scald burns and other occasional status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roserade's chances to switch in come from Water-types, walls it can threaten or set Spikes against like Florges, and predicted switches to Pokemon it checks. However, be careful when directly switching Roserade into Water-types; Mega Blastoise 2HKOes it with Dark Pulse or Ice Beam, making aggressive use of Spikes risky. Slowbro can OHKO Roserade on the switch with Psyshock, and Ice Beam Milotic likely 2HKOes. Making double switches is the best way to get Roserade into battle unharmed and is particularly important if it lacks Synthesis. Setting Spikes should be your default action when a foe is forced out, especially if that foe is a spinner or Defogger, but if the opponent is relying on shaky offensive answers to Roserade like Fire-types, smacking them with an attack to limit their switches will lower the pressure they exert. Don't use Leaf Storm recklessly, though; some Pokemon can set up on -2 Roserade, including Ninetales, Zygarde-10%, and Necrozma. Roserade's main job is to set Spikes and punch holes early-game; once it's done so, you're generally free to let it get revenge killed so you don't lose momentum. Keep it around if it's running Synthesis and is a major threat to your opponent's bulky core, though.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roserade is best suited for particularly offensive teams, which benefit most from entry hazards and don't mind Roserade's lack of defensive value. Sweepers such as Barbaracle, Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%, and Cloyster like having Spikes to make OHKOing foes easier. For example, Spikes damage is necessary for Zygarde-10% to possibly OHKO Milotic with boosted attacks. Defoggers contradict using an offensive Spikes setter, so you'll need a spinner or Magic Bounce user like Mega Blastoise, Donphan, or Espeon if you want entry hazard control. The only Defoggers that Roserade struggles against are Flying-types like Mandibuzz and Mantine, so Pokemon that can punish them like Raikou and Tyrantrum are advised. Roserade gets forced out easily; you can use the likes of Noivern and Goodra to switch into Fire-types and try bulky blanket checks like Cresselia and Porygon2 to absorb Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows. Choice Scarf or priority users such as Gardevoir and Golisopod can minimize the damage dealt by foes exploiting Roserade.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With its decent defensive typing, good mixed bulk, and access to Recover, Gastrodon is a good defensive Pokemon that can check some of RU's most prominent offensive threats such as Zygarde-10%, Mega Blastoise, Metagross, and Noivern. Gastrodon's Storm Drain ability also gives it even more defensive presence, allowing it to come in against Water-type moves like Scald and check offensive Water-types like Barbaracle. While Gastrodon's defensive typing leaves it with only one weakness, Grass is an omnipresent offensive type in RU, meaning Pokemon like Virizion, Roserade, and Shaymin can easily take it out. Its inability to deal with status conditions and vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards mean that Gastrodon can be easily overwhelmed. In fact, most of the Water-types Gastrodon would like to check like Milotic and Slowbro often carry Toxic to cripple it. Gastrodon is also rather passive, since it usually relies on Toxic for most of its damage output, meaning common wallbreakers like Machamp and Escavalier can easily threaten it out of battle. Its main competition comes from Slowbro, which is less passive, has a Fighting resistance, and has arguably a better defensive ability in Regenerator.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Yawn can be used to force switches against setup sweepers like Barbaracle. Clear Smog could also be useful for combating setup sweepers such as Raikou and Barbaracle. Gastrodon can potentially pull off an offensive set with Life Orb or Choice Specs, but it fails to take out common defensive cores with its poor offensive movepool, only adequate offenses, and poor speed. Rindo Berry is another option to allow Gastrodon to deal with Hidden Power Grass variants of Salazzle and Raikou much better, as well as potentially KOing a Grass-type like Mega Sceptile with Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Because of its nasty 4x weakness to Grass, Gastrodon is forced out of battle by Pokemon like Virizion, Roserade, Shaymin, and Mega Sceptile. Roserade and Shaymin are not thwarted by Toxic thanks to their Poison typing and Natural Cure, respectively. Virizion does need to be cautious about directly switching into Toxic or Scald, however. Grass-types also need to be cautious about switching into Ice Beam. Gastrodon also needs to worry about foes with Grass-type coverage like Ninetales, Hidden Power Grass Salazzle, and Yanmega.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Gastrodon takes damage from all entry hazards and is especially vulnerable to Toxic, which can wear it down to where it can be KOed before it can use Recover.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Machamp, Curse Snorlax, and Goodra can easily overwhelm Gastrodon with their powerful offenses. Machamp, in particular, can use status conditions from Gastrodon to activate its Guts. Snorlax also doesn't mind Toxic or Scald because it can stomach any hit Gastrodon goes for and proceed to set up or use Rest in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Status-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon that can deal with status conditions such as Taunt Mandibuzz, Refresh Milotic, and Registeel can easily pivot into Toxic and force Gastrodon out of battle with Taunt or their own Toxic.</p>",

Ice Beam can OHKO Zygarde-10%, Noivern after Stealth Rock damage, and a weakened Flygon, as well as dealing important chip damage to a potential Grass-type that attempts to switch into it such as Virizion, Roserade, or Shaymin. Toxic can cripple common switch-ins such as Slowbro, Goodra, and Florges. Scald is a decent option that can spread burns to physically offensive Pokemon like Metagross and Tyrantrum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread and a Careful nature, Gastrodon is 4HKOed by Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse and only 2HKOed by +2 Barbaracle's Continental Crush and Choice Band Zygarde-10%'s Outrage and Thousand Arrows after Stealth Rock. 16 Attack EVs guarantee that Barbaracle will be OHKOed after Spikes or Stealth Rock damage and a Shell Smash Defense drop. Storm Drain gives Gastrodon a Water immunity and a Special Attack boost if it is hit by a Water-type move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gastrodon should aim to use its resistances and immunities to pivot into Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Metagross, Barbaracle, Arcanine, Raikou, and Noivern so it gets an opportunity to use Toxic, an attack, or Recover. Thanks to Storm Drain, Gastrodon can easily take a Scald from Milotic, Slowbro, and Mantine; however, be cautious about these Pokemon going for Toxic if they expect Gastrodon to directly switch into them. Gastrodon should use Toxic on bulky switch-ins like Mandibuzz, Goodra, and Florges. If running Scald, use it to potentially burn any physical attackers like Metagross, Barbaracle, and Tyrantrum if they decide to stay in on Gastrodon. Be careful with using Scald if the opposing team has Machamp, as it can use its Guts ability to gain a boost in power from a Scald burn. Gastrodon should also be cautious of using Scald against bulky Pokemon like Slowbro, Milotic, and Porygon2, since Gastrodon would rather poison these targets than accidentally burn them. Gastrodon should use Recover whenever it can, ideally by forcing a switch against a Pokemon like Salazzle or Raikou. Be aware of any Grass-types the opponent may have on their team, as they can easily pivot into any of Gastrodon's STAB moves and proceed to threaten it out. Roserade and Shaymin are noteworthy, as they can also handle Toxic either by being immune to it or getting rid of it with Natural Cure. Gastrodon also has to worry about Grass-type coverage from Pokemon such as Ninetales and Yanmega as well as Hidden Power Grass from Raikou and Salazzle. These Pokemon do need to be cautious of switching into Ice Beam or Earthquake, however. If threatened with Toxic, pivot Gastodon out and replace it with a status-immune Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gastrodon's immunity to Scald is a big sigh of relief for physically offensive Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Metagross, and Flygon. Its Water immunity in general can be beneficial to Pokemon like Rhyperior, Arcanine, and Lycanroc-D. A check to Grass-types is mandatory when using Gastrodon, so offensive checks like Noivern, Ninetales, and Salazzle as well as defensive checks like Registeel, Goodra, and Dragalge synergize extremely well with it. Salazzle and Dragalge can also directly switch into Toxic and absorb Toxic Spikes for Gastrodon. Although niche, Golbat makes a decent partner for Gastrodon, since it can remove entry hazards with Defog and switch into Grass-type attacks for Gastrodon. Other hazard removers like Forretress, Tsareena, and Mega Blastoise appreciate Gastrodon checking Pokemon that threaten them out such as Salazzle, Raikou, and Arcanine. A cleric or Healing Wish user such as Florges or Shaymin can help cure Gastrodon of status and recover its HP. Pokemon like Noivern, Gardevoir, and Swellow appreciate Gastrodon's ability to soft check Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that resist their STAB moves. In return, all of these Pokemon can threaten out status absorbers like Machamp for Gastrodon.</p>"

  "Mismagius": {
    "overview": "<p>Ghost is an uncommon but potent attacking type, and Mismagius's Speed and access to Nasty Plot make it a premier offensive Ghost-type in the tier. Coupled with solid neutral coverage and a Z-Move of its choice, this combination lets Mismagius take advantage of the tier's shortage of Pokemon resistant or immune to Ghost to pick apart common balance cores. Its ability Levitate allows it to avoid entry hazards such as Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web as well as handily check Nidoqueen and certain variants of Curse Snorlax. Unfortunately, Mismagius's raw strength is rather low, and it is reliant on Nasty Plot-boosted attacks or Z-Moves to do effective damage. Its effectiveness is also compromised by a mediocre defensive stat spread, with low physical bulk and basically zero special resistances, which can make setup or even survival difficult, as it risks being 2HKOed at worst by every invested neutral attack, rendering it especially vulnerable to faster attackers. Furthermore, Mismagius must compete with other setup attackers such as Virizion, Bewear, Raikou, and Toxicroak, which boast stallbreaking ability while possessing either comparable Speed, greater immediate power, or better defensive utility. However, Mismagius can still make use of its immunities and type coverage to harass most bulky Pokemon such as Registeel, Milotic, physically defensive Mandibuzz, and Mantine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mismagius can consider a bulkier Will-O-Wisp + Hex set that takes a slower but still effective approach to wallbreaking while being less vulnerable to slower physical attackers, but it loses much of its worth against more offensive teams compared to Nasty Plot variants. Dazzling Gleam could be used to handle specific targets such as Bewear and Pangoro better than its other moves, but it is relatively unnecessary, as both of them get OHKOed by a +2 Gigavolt Havoc or get chipped into +2 Thunderbolt range after an initial Thunderbolt. Memento is an appealing option to give its teammates such as Barbaracle and Lycanroc-D prime setup opportunities, keeping up heavy offensive pressure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit is a huge thorn in Mismagius's side, as Mismagius can be prematurely removed from the game should it make a misstep. Pursuit Snorlax is one of the most reliable trappers against Mismagius, while Sneasel's Choice Band-boosted Pursuit has a chance to OHKO Mismagius even if it stays in. Drapion and Escavalier can trap an unboosted Mismagius or one that has already expended its Z-Move but must tread carefully against a +2 Z-Move. While Escavalier can use Protect to help bear the brunt of the +2 Z-Move, it likely still won't be able to Pursuit trap Mismagius, as it risks getting beaten one-on-one. Honchkrow can corner Mismagius with Pursuit and Sucker Punch mind games. Bear in mind, however, that all these Pursuit users bar Snorlax do risk getting tripped up by Colbur Berry sets.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-type Pokemon</strong>: Any Snorlax set that isn't helpless against Ghost-types can be a big roadblock for Mismagius. Porygon2 can usually beat down Mismagius one-on-one, as it outdamages and beats non-Electrium Z Mismagius fairly comfortably while it Recovers and thwarts Mismagius's efforts. It can also cripple Mismagius with status ailments, but the threat of Taunt or Substitute makes this a less reliable response. However, Porygon2 variants that lack Foul Play may risk getting overpowered by Electrium Z Mismagius, especially if it gets Taunted at the wrong moment.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Mismagius is highly vulnerable to almost every Pokemon faster than it, as it doesn't resist most of their attacks. The likes of Aerodactyl, Zygarde-10%, Swellow, Virizion, and various physical Choice Scarf users such as Tyrantrum and Flygon have little trouble taking down Mismagius, with Swellow receiving special mention for being able to penetrate Mismagius's Substitute with Scrappy Boomburst, as well as boasting an immunity to Shadow Ball. However, Mismagius does have enough special bulk to survive blows from some special attackers such as Noivern, Salazzle, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, although without Never-Ending Nightmare or those attackers being weakened beforehand, Mismagius still usually loses this matchup anyway. Priority moves such as Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, Metagross's Bullet Punch, Golisopod's First Impression, and Mega Abomasnow's Ice Shard can do a large number to Mismagius or outright KO it, but these Pokemon do risk getting KOed by the appropriate Z-Move should they fail to KO, and Toxicroak must also be cautious of the potential Substitute or Colbur Berry.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot doubles Mismagius's Special Attack, allowing its attacks to sting that much harder. Shadow Ball is Mismagius's primary attacking move, hitting a large majority of the tier for at least neutral damage. Thunderbolt makes for a great coverage option, smacking Mandibuzz and Milotic hard, and it also has enough power to OHKO Mega Blastoise and even the most specially defensive Mantine variants after a Nasty Plot boost. It is notable that +2 Thunderbolt followed by +0 Thunderbolt is capable of 2HKOing physically defensive Milotic, meaning Milotic's Haze won't save it. Taunt shuts down recovery and status moves, giving Mismagius an easier time breaking defensive teams and turning mono-attacking Pokemon such as Registeel and RestTalk Snorlax into complete setup fodder. It also stops Stealth Rock and Defog, which can sometimes come in handy for entry hazard control when combined with Mismagius's spinblocking capability. Substitute is another way to take advantage of Pokemon that are reliant on status or have ineffective attacks, exchanging the ability to prevent the use of non-attacking moves for a safety buffer against revenge killing or Pursuit attempts, as well as heavily punishing Pokemon Choice-locked into attacks that Mismagius is immune to.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Speed investment alongside a Timid nature lets Mismagius outspeed as many threats as possible, such as Yanmega, Adamant Zygarde-10%, Shaymin, and Ninetales, as well as Speed tie with opposing Mismagius. 8 Defense EVs allow Mismagius to never get OHKOed by Adamant Donphan's Knock Off. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack to maximize Mismagius's damage output. Ghostium Z grants Mismagius access to Never-Ending Nightmare, providing an immediate source of raw STAB damage. At +2, Never-Ending Nightmare has enough power to OHKO Goodra and bulky Escavalier (though Protect must be scouted), while an unboosted Never-Ending Nightmare can OHKO the likes of Cresselia, Bronzong, Roserade, and bulky Arcanine after Stealth Rock damage roughly half of the time, as well as secure the OHKO on Ninetales after Stealth Rock damage. Electrium Z is another alternative, as it allows Mismagius the potential to OHKO Mega Blastoise, as well as set up directly in front of Milotic and specially defensive Mandibuzz to then OHKO them with +2 Gigavolt Havoc. It also allows Mismagius to OHKO Drapion and Bewear at +2. Both item options weaken Knock Off as a bonus, though keep in mind that neither will save Mismagius from the stronger Knock Offs coming from Drapion, Sneasel, and Pangoro. Colbur Berry is a fine alternative item choice should the team's Z-Crystal slot be used up. Colbur Berry allows Mismagius to either switch into Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse and do a chunk with Thunderbolt, making it easier to revenge kill and thus preventing it from using Rapid Spin, or win against Mega Blastoise one-on-one. It also enables Mismagius to better withstand Mandibuzz's Foul Play and helps reduce the threat of Pursuit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mismagius's best chance to set up Nasty Plot usually comes in the form of walls that it can scare out or Pokemon that cannot threaten it as it sets up, such as Bronzong, Cresselia, Registeel, Mantine, and RestTalk Snorlax. Mismagius can use either Taunt or Substitute to neutralize most of the aforementioned Pokemon to begin breaking through the opponent's defensive backbone. Mismagius is also one of the few offensive Pokemon that can set up on Nidoqueen. Because Mismagius's longevity can be lacking, it would be unwise to hold on to its Z-Move for longer than necessary, and using it at the right moment can be crucial in softening up a threat or forcing a switch while racking up entry hazard damage. While Mismagius doesn't have too much to fear from most Pursuit users due to the threat of its +2 Z-Move, it would be ideal to remove them before Mismagius sets up so that Mismagius doesn't have to use its Z-Move prematurely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mismagius is a great fit on offensive hazard stacking teams where its aforementioned qualities of preserving entry hazards can be a useful asset and it can keep up the pressure with Nasty Plot as well as disrupt the opposition with Taunt or Substitute. Powerful entry hazard setters such as Roserade, Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, Metagross, Golisopod, Mega Glalie, and Araquanid are appealing teammates, as they can help maintain offensive momentum. Mismagius appreciates having teammates that can dispose of bulky Pokemon that withstand Ghost-type attacks such as non-RestTalk Snorlax, Porygon2, Mandibuzz, and Umbreon. Fighting-types such as Bewear, Virizion, and Toxicroak make terrific teammates, as they can put major pressure on bulky Normal-types as well as Mandibuzz and they especially appreciate any entry hazards on the field to make punching holes into the opponent's team easier on them. Mismagius is also vulnerable to most faster attackers such as Zygarde-10%, Noivern, and Choice Scarf users like Tyrantrum and Gardevoir, though it should be noted that faster special attackers can't revenge kill a healthy Mismagius and may be susceptible to a boosted attack. Setup sweepers and late-game cleaners, such as Barbaracle, Virizion, Speed Boost Yanmega, Zygarde-10%, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Z-Celebrate Shaymin, greatly appreciate Mismagius breaking the opponent's cores, with some of them even potentially taking advantage of some of the faster attackers that threaten Mismagius.</p>"

  "Honchkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Honchkrow is a threatening wallbreaker and potential cleaner in the metagame. Honchkrow has access to a very strong Brave Bird and a great coverage option in Superpower to increase its offensive presence. Moxie gives Honchkrow an Attack boost every time it KOes a Pokemon, threatening a snowball effect in which it keeps racking up boosts. Sucker Punch helps Honchkrow revenge kill and clean due to its priority. Sadly, Honchkrow is burdened with poor bulk and Speed, relying on Sucker Punch to KO faster threats like Salazzle and Flygon, and Sucker Punch is easily exploitable by switching to a resistant Pokemon or setting up on it. Honchkrow is also weak to Stealth Rock, giving it fewer opportunities to switch in. Brave Bird recoil also weakens Honchkrow, exploiting its restricted longevity. Despite its decent niche, it is rather difficult to justify using Honchkrow as a wallbreaker compared to other Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Zygarde-10%, and Virizion, as they are faster, have more reliable setup options, and have better defensive utility in the case of Mega Blastoise.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Night Slash is a good option for a consistent Dark-type STAB move as not having to play mind games versus Metagross can be invaluable at times, but due to its abysmal Speed, Honchkrow appreciates the priority that Sucker Punch provides. Roost is good for recovery, but Honchkrow has to give up Superpower or Taunt, which are both useful, and Honchkrow has horrible defenses, so it has few opportunities to heal. Steel Wing is decent for Diancie but very situational. Choice Scarf allows Honchkrow to be an effective revenge killer and a fast cleaner, but Honchkrow likes to use different moves and not have to worry about locking into a move. Fightinium Z is great for knocking down Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel and Tyrantrum without the drops that come with Superpower, but Honchkrow sorely misses the Dark-type nuke with Darkinium Z. Protect can be viable when First Impression from Golisopod can threaten to KO and is mainly good as a 4th slot move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: Diancie resists both of Honchkrow's STAB moves, can take a Superpower, and OHKOes it back with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Flying-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Unless they are all chipped, physically defensive Pokemon resistant to Flying like Steelix and Rhyperior can tank hits from Honchkrow and remove it with powerful attacks. However, they need to watch out for Superpower if they are weakened.</p> <p><strong>Faster Dark-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Due to its subpar Speed, Honchkrow is heavily pressured by Pokemon like Virizion and Drapion which all KO it back. Virizion resists Sucker Punch and can OHKO with Close Combat, and Drapion resists Sucker Punch and can damage Honchkrow with Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority</strong>: Due to its bad defenses, Honchkrow is prone to being revenge killed by faster priority moves like Extreme Speed from Arcanine and Zygarde-10%, which outprioritize Sucker Punch. Accelerock from Lycanroc-D and Ice Shard from Vanilluxe and Mega Glalie also outprioritize Sucker Punch and OHKO Honchkrow back. Honchkrow must also be wary of First Impression from Golisopod, which also OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to its Flying typing, Stealth Rock cuts into Honchkrow's already limited longevity. Status conditions such as burns, especially from Scald and Will-O-Wisp, make it lose a lot of offensive pressure. Brave Bird recoil makes Honchkrow easier to revenge kill.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Darkinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is a very powerful STAB move and breaks holes in the opponent's team. Sucker Punch in conjunction with Darkinium Z allows Honchkrow to have a one-time powerful Dark-type STAB move and not have to rely on prediction, doing massive damage to Brave Bird-resistant Pokemon like Bronzong and Metagross. Sucker Punch on its own is a fantastic priority move to revenge kill Pokemon like Gardevoir and Salazzle and can let Honchkrow clean weakened teams. Superpower gives Honchkrow a way to break past Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-types that can take a Brave Bird and not worry about Sucker Punch like Registeel and Rhyperior. Superpower also hits Mandibuzz hard when it uses Roost. Taunt allows Honchkrow to ease some prediction and stallbreak, disrupting the likes of Umbreon and Registeel and gives Honchkrow a way to stop them from spreading Toxic while also preventing entry hazard removal via Defog. Pursuit can help when reading switches from faster Pokemon that want to predict Sucker Punch and remove Psychic-types, Ghost-types, and weakened Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs in Speed and a Jolly nature allow Honchkrow to outspeed most defensive Pokemon like Florges and Mantine, giving it the opportunity to use Taunt to prevent entry hazards from being removed or effectively KO them if sufficiently weakened. Additionally, the EVs let it outspeed the likes of Metagross as well as standard Florges and Cresselia sets. Darkinium Z makes Sucker Punch a one-time attack to break through Bronzong and Metagross without having to rely on Sucker Punch. Z-Sucker Punch also heavily dents Cresselia. Life Orb is a solid option if you have another Pokemon with a Z-Crystal and is a lot more threatening versus teams without Darkinium Z Z-Sucker Punch targets, but this weakens Honchkrow more quickly, giving it less time to wallbreak, and makes it a liability to getting revenge killed. Adamant is an alternative nature and is useful to wallbreak more easier, but Honchkrow will lose the Speed that allows it to threaten Metagross, no longer Speed tie with Tyrantrum, and be unlikely to beat Cresselia. Darkinium Z can also be used for Z-Taunt; it gives Honchkrow +1 Attack immediately and helps in scenarios when using Superpower, as it can lower its Attack and Defense, which Z-Taunt alleviates. However, it's situational, and Black Hole Eclipse is a much better option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Honchkrow is best used early-game to support a different sweeper by punching a massive hole in the opponent's team. Honchkrow can also be used as a late-game cleaner due to the combination of Moxie and Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch-resistant Pokemon like Virizion and Toxicroak need to be removed, and faster Pokemon such as Salazzle and Raikou need to be chipped into range of Sucker Punch before Honchkrow attempts to clean. Bring Honchkrow in with a double switch, with a slow pivot, or after a teammate has been knocked out. It also needs to be kept as healthy as possible, so try to keep Stealth Rock off the field and do not let it get afflicted with any status condition. Toxic puts it on a timer, burns make it lose its offensive presence, and paralysis cuts its Speed and can potentially make it miss out on a crucial KO, so ensure you prevent that as best as you can. Honchkrow should never be switched into strong attacks, as it is rather frail. However, switching into predicted Psychic- and Ground-type moves is alright barring Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows. Decide if conserving Honchkrow's HP for a late-game sweep is worth it because recklessly using Brave Bird or switching into Stealth Rock cuts into Honchkrow's HP a lot, so it might not get to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Some of Honchkrow's best teammates are entry hazard setters and removers; the best example is Donphan, which is effective at spinning and keeping hazards on the opponent's side of the field, and it is an effective check to some faster threats like Zygarde-10% and Raikou. Araquanid is also really good for setting Sticky Web and weakening the opponent's team for Honchkrow to clean more easily. Tsareena is also good, as both it and Honchkrow are really potent wallbreakers, and Tsareena can use Rapid Spin reliably. Honchkrow works best with Pokemon like Mega Blastoise, Virizion, and Barbaracle that can pressure Rock- and Steel-types. Fire-types like Ninetales and Arcanine also threaten Steel-types. Healing Wish users like Gardevoir and Shaymin are great partners as they can heal Honchkrow when it is weakened, allowing more reckless play. Slow pivots like Tsareena and Forretress are extremely important to bring Honchkrow in safely. Fast pivots like Raikou and Flygon work as well, as they can force switches to give Honchkrow opportunities to come in.</p>"

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong is one of the bulkiest Stealth Rock setters in the tier thanks to its amazing defenses, fantastic defensive typing, and great ability in Levitate, all of which allow it to check common offensive Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Goodra, and Mega Sceptile. It can also provide some offensive presence with Psywave, which hits targets that resist Psychic for somewhat consistent damage like Registeel and Metagross. However, Bronzong is still extremely passive and normally invites in dangerous offensive Pokemon such as Zygarde-10%, Mega Blastoise, and Salazzle. Bronzong also lacks a reliable method of recovery outside of Leftovers, making it extremely vulnerable to Knock Off. Its low Speed makes it very vulnerable to being forced out by Taunt users such as Noivern, Mandibuzz, and Mismagius. Bronzong also has some hefty competition as a defensive Steel-type: Registeel is a better defensive pick if its team has a good Ground-resistant Pokemon, while Metagross has a much greater offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong could opt to run Trick Room and Explosion, since it has the durability to set it multiple times and can dent frail offensive checks like Salazzle and Noivern. Still, Bronzong requires offensive investment to deal any sort of meaningful damage. Heal Block is an interesting move to allow Bronzong to beat Curse Snorlax and other bulky Pokemon like Slowbro, Cresselia, and Porygon2, but Bronzong is often too strapped for slots to use it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Dark-types like Drapion, Houndoom, and Pangoro threaten Bronzong out of battle. Drapion can also Pursuit trap Bronzong easily. Bronzong also fears Knock Off from Pokemon like Donphan, Passimian, and Hariyama because it needs its Leftovers to recover its health and is vulnerable to Dark Pulse from the most common Rapid Spin user, Mega Blastoise.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Due to its low Speed, Bronzong is shut down by various Taunt users such as Noivern, Mandibuzz, and Mismagius.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Salazzle and Ninetales can force out Bronzong and set up with Nasty Plot. Heatproof variants of Bronzong have an easier time against them, though. Arcanine is notable, since it targets Bronzong's uninvested Defense. Many Fire-types can also run Will-O-Wisp to chip Bronzong's health and weaken the power of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Machamp, Toxicroak, and Escavalier can threaten Bronzong out of battle, since Machamp doesn't mind Toxic thanks to Guts, while the latter two are immune to it. Once in battle, they can use Knock Off or set up against Bronzong. Raikou is also a notable check; it can set up Substitute to stop Bronzong's Toxic, begin setting up, and beat it with a boosted Z-Move. It should be noted that Toxicroak and Raikou do not appreciate switching into Earthquake, however.</p> <p><strong>Sigilyph and Xatu</strong>: Both of these Pokemon are not bothered by any of Bronzong's moves and can keep Stealth Rock off the field with Magic Bounce and Defog.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bronzong's amazing defenses and handful of resistances allow it to set up Stealth Rock multiple times over the course of a match. Toxic wears down bulky switch-ins such as Slowbro, Mega Blastoise, and Cresselia. Psywave allows Bronzong to chip down Pokemon immune to Toxic such as Metagross, Registeel, and opposing Bronzong. Protect not only allows Bronzong to scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Tyrantrum, Bewear, and Noivern but also allows it to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and rack up Toxic damage. Gyro Ball could be run instead to deal a massive amount of damage to fast offensive threats like Noivern, Gardevoir, and Mega Sceptile, which gives Bronzong an edge over Registeel. Earthquake is a good move to catch Fire-types like Salazzle and Ninetales off guard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature is used to maximize Bronzong's special bulk and increase the damage that Gyro Ball will do. If you're not running Gyro Ball, Calm is preferred to outspeed Choice Band Snorlax. Levitate allows Bronzong to pivot in against Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Flygon, and Rhyperior. Leftovers gives Bronzong a little extra recovery every turn. Heatproof can be considered, since it gives Bronzong an extra resistance to Fire-type moves, which is also something that gives it a slight niche over Registeel and Metagross. If it's chosen over Levitate, Bronzong should always run Earthquake to beat Salazzle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzong should set up Stealth Rock as soon as it can. To do this, it can pivot into certain special attackers like Gardevoir, Goodra, and Mega Sceptile or into Ground-types like Flygon and Rhyperior. Be cautious when doing this, because Gardevoir and Noivern can easily go for Trick or Switcheroo and remove Bronzong's only method of recovering health. Similarly, Bronzong should steer clear of Knock Off users like Donphan, Machamp, and Escavalier. Use Protect to scout any potential Choice-locked Pokemon like Flygon, Tyrantrum, and Passimian as well as for Z-Moves from Raikou or Virizion, to rack up Toxic poison damage, and to gain a little extra Leftovers recovery. Toxic should be used against entry hazard clearers such as Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, and Donphan so that Bronzong's Stealth Rock is on the field as long as possible. Make sure that any bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Escavalier are in check, since all of them can chip Bronzong down or set up against it. It's important to know that they themselves can be chipped by Psywave. If Bronzong is utilizing Heatproof over Levitate, make sure it is used as a lure. Thus, keep Bronzong away from Earthquake, do not let it take Spikes damage, and make sure you can predict when a Fire-type or a foe with Fire-type coverage like Roserade comes in so Bronzong can fire off Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Raikou, Salazzle, and Lycanroc-D appreciate Bronzong's Levitate support and ability to hard wall Nidoqueen. Pairing Bronzong with a Spikes setter like Golisopod or Roserade can help pressure offensive Pokemon much more. Florges makes for a decent defensive partner for Bronzong, since it can provide Wish support as well as take Dark-type attacks aimed at Bronzong, while Bronzong in return can take Poison- and Steel-type attacks for Florges. A teammate that can check Fire-types such as Zygarde-10%, Mega Blastoise, or Slowbro is also recommended. Bronzong can check Grass-, Ice-, and Dragon-types in return. Having a Knock Off absorber such as Virizion, Z-Move Raikou, or Mega Blastoise can help Bronzong because it needs its Leftovers to recover health. Offensive Pokemon like Machamp, Salazzle, and Donphan can check the bulky Steel-types that can give Bronzong trouble.</p>"

  "Drapion": {
    "overview": "<p>Drapion carves itself a niche as a decent trapper and wallbreaker in RU. Its adequate Speed allows it to outspeed common Pokemon like Roserade and Choice Specs Gardevoir and dispose of them. Furthermore, it is one of the few Pursuit trappers in the tier; it can trap dangerous Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius, Cresselia, Metagross, and Bronzong thanks to the threat of a powerful Knock Off. However, despite having decent Speed, Drapion still fails to outpace offensive Pokemon that can threaten it such as Flygon and Shaymin. Due to its low Special Defense, Drapion also is highly susceptible to strong special attackers that outpace it like Salazzle and Swellow. It also struggles a great deal to break through many defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Pyukumuku, and Milotic due to its somewhat lackluster Attack stat in comparison to other wallbreakers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance can let Drapion become a stronger wallbreaker and break through its checks with Waterium Z or Groundium Z, although this set is far less splashable than Choice Band. Shuca Berry can also be sued to improve its matchup against Flygon and Zygarde-10%. A Choice Scarf set is feasible and can operate somewhat well, allowing Drapion to outrun the vast majority of the tier, meaning it can revenge kill frailer mons such as Sneasel, Salazzle, Virizion, Shaymin, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Drapion is a decent user of Toxic Spikes, as it is able to set them up in front of a Pokemon it forces out such as Bronzong or Mismagius. However, it has an extremely hard time fitting the move on any set. Ice Fang can be used to lure in Flygon and KO it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster and hard-hitting Pokemon can revenge kill Drapion very reliably, for example; Yanmega after a Speed boost, Swellow, Salazzle, Flygon, and Shaymin can all outspeed and OHKO Drapion.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Burns can cripple Drapion's ability to function as a hard hitter. Since Drapion values its Speed to sweep effectively, paralysis can also be extremely detrimental.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Donphan and Colbur Berry Palossand can switch into Drapion with impunity and force it out. Faster Ground-types, like Zygarde-10% and Flygon, can outspeed and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with sustainable bulk such as Milotic and Umbreon can check Drapion, and offensive Pokemon with high natural physical bulk like Cloyster and Tyrantrum can take Drapion's hits and hit back harder or set up.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist Poison Jab, so Drapion can struggle against the likes of Toxicroak and Dragalge if it isn't carrying Earthquake. Salazzle and Chlorophyll-boosted Venusaur can over overwhelm Drapion with their STAB attacks or coverage moves.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake allows Drapion to hit most Poison- and Rock-types such as Toxicroak, Dragalge and Tyrantrum super effectively. Aqua Tail can be used over Earthquake due to its ability to hit Donphan, Rhyperior, and Aerodactyl on the switch while still damaging most targets that Earthquake hits; however, it misses out on nailing Toxicroak, and none of the aforementioned targets like switching into Knock Off anyway. Aqua Tail also has slightly lower damage output and accuracy than Earthquake does.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The choice between Drapion's abilities isn't particularly important; Sniper powers up critical hits, which, while not the most reliable way to net KOs, can come in handy in a pinch. Alternatively, Battle Armor could be used over Sniper if you prefer its reliability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Knock Off liberally early-game, as many Pokemon dislike having their item removed. However, try to predict if the opponent tries to send in a Pokemon with an irremovable item or a resistance to Dark, such as Mega Blastoise or Florges, and hit them with the appropriate coverage move. Due to its immunity to Toxic, Drapion can switch into predicted uses of Toxic to Pursuit trap and eliminate foes like Bronzong. Drapion's excellent defensive typing allows it to also switch into Pokemon like Mismagius, Roserade, and variants of Shaymin lacking Earth Power in a pinch. Despite their relative rarity, burns and paralysis severely limit Drapion's effectiveness as a wallbreaker. Drapion's lacking Special Defense leaves it vulnerable to strong special attackers like Salazzle and Swellow that can outpace Drapion and dent it severely with their STAB attacks, so it's advised to not stay in against these types of foes. However, most special attackers dislike switching into Drapion's attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Drapion's ability to Pursuit trap foes are great partners, such as Gardevoir and Metagross. Drapion can form a wallbreaking core with other Pokemon like Mega Abomasnow, Machamp, and Roserade, as they can break through walls that Drapion is unable to, such as Pyukumuku, Mandibuzz, and Milotic. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Virizion are good partners for Drapion due to their ability to switch into and hit most Ground-types super effectively. Fighting-types like Medicham and Bewear are excellent teammates, since Drapion can beat Fairy-types with Poison Jab and Pursuit trap Ghost-types. In return, they can beat bulkier walls that Drapion is unable to break, such as Umbreon. Cleaners such as Swellow and Speed Boost Yanmega can take advantage of Drapion's wallbreaking abilities to sweep the opposing team.</p>"

  "Toxicroak": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak is one of the biggest nuisances for balance teams thanks to Dry Skin, which lets it use Pokemon like Milotic and Araquanid as setup bait, its immunity to Toxic, and access to Swords Dance. In fact, even offensive teams are forced to prepare for it because of Sucker Punch. It has the option to run Poisonium Z to flat-out invalidate checks to its Life Orb set such as Slowbro, Brave Bird Mandibuzz, and even Cresselia provided Stealth Rock is up. It also has further versatility by means of other potential sets such as Choice Scarf. Toxicroak's unique defensive typing allows it to check Pokemon like Virizion, Roserade lacking Hidden Power Fire, and Mega Blastoise in a pinch. However, although Toxicroak's Speed tier allows it to outpace common threats like Mega Blastoise, it leaves a lot to be desired with a good bit of the unboosted tier outpacing it, meaning Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Salazzle can revenge kill Toxicroak as long as they aren't in range of Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Toxicroak has to compete with a plethora of other Fighting-types for a teamslot. For example, a team might prefer Virizion's Speed tier, Sawk's utility in Sturdy, Assault Vest Machamp's ability to act as a glue Pokemon, or Pangoro's immediate power over Toxicroak's assets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off gives Toxicroak further utility in crippling Pokemon like Porygon2 and allows it to KO Slowbro with Stealth Rock damage. However, Sucker Punch + Darkinium Z does the same thing but trades Knock Off's utility for a good matchup against offensive teams. Ice Punch on Swords Dance sets lets Toxicroak deal with checks like Dragalge, Donphan, and Nidoqueen but is otherwise useless when another move like Sucker Punch would be much more useful. On Choice Scarf sets, Ice Punch makes it easier for Toxicroak to revenge kill Pokemon like Noivern. Earthquake on Swords Dance sets deals with checks like Dragalge, Nidoqueen, and Metagross while hitting opposing Toxicroak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Toxicroak's weak non-STAB Sucker Punch leaves it vulnerable to Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tyrantrum and Noivern as well as faster threats such as Ninetales and Choice Specs Ribombee.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Sturdy walls like Slowbro and Cresselia can deal with standard Life Orb Toxicroak, but both can be removed by Poisonium Z variants, and Slowbro has to watch out for Darkinium Z as well.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Donphan sponge up any of Toxicroak's attacks and KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Many Poison-types, notably Dragalge and Nidoqueen, are fantastic Toxicroak checks thanks to their typing, which lets them resist Toxicroak's STAB attacks.

Drain Punch improves Toxicroak's longevity and allows it to more freely set up on walls like Registeel, since it'll be able to heal off any damage taken. Sucker Punch, when boosted, is great for removing revenge killers such as Sigilyph and Choice Scarf Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb allows Toxicroak to increase its damage output at the cost of slight recoil. Dry Skin lets Toxicroak capitalize on its unique defensive typing by countering Pokemon like Golisopod lacking Drill Run and Araquanid. Poisonium Z lets Toxicroak dismantle defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Cresselia more easily, as Acid Downpour will almost always OHKO both of them after Stealth Rock damage, whereas Life Orb sets have to chip them down or fish for poison with Gunk Shot to remove them at +2. However, this cuts into Toxicroak's matchup against more offensive teams, as without Life Orb, its Sucker Punch will be extremely underwhelming. Darkinium Z works similarly to Poisonium Z, mainly removing Bronzong but also dealing with Slowbro and Cresselia. However, Toxicroak then struggles to deal with Brave Bird Mandibuzz, something Poisonium Z sets excel at.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up early-game against balance teams on passive defensive Pokemon like Registeel and bulky Water-types like Milotic and break down defensive cores to make it easier for setup sweepers or even Choice Scarf Pokemon to clean up opposing teams. However, against more offensive teams, Sucker Punch Toxicroak has the potential to sweep late-game, so keep in mind that it might be more advantageous to go that route instead. Make sure that opposing means of defensive counterplay are sufficiently chipped before trying to set up and wallbreak, especially when running a Life Orb set. For example, if the opposing team has a Cresselia, don't bother to set up. Instead, aim to poison it with Gunk Shot or focus on chipping it down with other means like Toxic and Stealth Rock from teammates before using Swords Dance. Although Toxicroak's main role is as a sweeper, it can still capitalize on its unique defensive typing to check Pokemon like Virizion and Araquanid. Also, when running a Z-Move, keep in mind that you can bluff a Choice Scarf set, so use that to set up on forced switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Toxicroak's ability to beat Water-types and break defensive cores work well with it. For example, late-game setup sweepers like Agility Metagross work well with it. Grass-types such as Shaymin work well with Toxicroak, as they appreciate its ability to break down Steel-types and take down Ground-types like Donphan and Gastrodon for it. Chip damage found in forms such as Toxic and Stealth Rock is key for chipping defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Cresselia, and Mandibuzz into range of Toxicroak's boosted attacks, so pairing it with teammates like Registeel and Toxic Metagross is beneficial. Other Fighting-types like Machamp and Virizion can be paired with Toxicroak, working as a wallbreaking core that wears down their checks together.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot allows Toxicroak to successfully remove setup sweepers like Virizion. Low Kick is used over other Fighting-type STAB moves like Drain Punch because it's much stronger against the usual targets, mainly Rock-, Steel-, and Normal-types such as Tyrantrum, Registeel, and Snorlax. Earthquake is great for revenge killing Pokemon like Salazzle and opposing Toxicroak that resist Toxicroak's STAB moves. Knock Off is great for crippling defensive switch-ins like Porygon2 and Bronzong and helps Toxicroak revenge kill Ghost- and Psychic-types like Mismagius and Sigilyph.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Toxicroak to revenge kill setup Pokemon like Drapion and Virizion. Dry Skin with Toxicroak's Poison / Fighting typing allows it to counter Pokemon like Araquanid and completely stop Pokemon like Toxic Mantine.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Toxicroak's main use is to revenge kill Pokemon, so use it to force out setup Pokemon like Salazzle. Toxicroak can be used to clean up weakened teams late-game as well. While other Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir have utility like Healing Wish, one of Choice Scarf Toxicroak's main advantages is its unique defensive typing that gives it the ability to act as a one- or two-time switch-in to many setup Pokemon such as Virizion, so make use of it to do so. As with every Choice item Pokemon, be cautious when using Toxicroak, as using a certain move might leave it vulnerable to opposing setup sweepers. For example, revenge killing a Virizion with Gunk Shot gives other setup Pokemon such as Barbaracle free rein to set up and sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers work great with Toxicroak, breaking down Pokemon that stand in the way of a late-game sweep with it. Thus, Pokemon such as Choice Band Metagross, Choice Band Tyrantrum, Choice Band Zygarde-10%, and Choice Specs Gardevoir as well as setup Pokemon such as Ninetales, Raikou, and Mega Abomasnow are good teammates. While a Choice Scarf allows Toxicroak to outpace the entire unboosted tier, it fails to beat Speed-boosting setup sweepers such as Zygarde-10% and Barbaracle, so make sure you have other ways to revenge kill them such as priority from Pokemon like Golisopod and niche Sturdy Pokemon like Sawk.</p>"

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow is quite the threat to be reckoned with in RU, as its potent STAB moves and solid coverage make it very difficult to switch into. Its solid bulk and key resistances to Water and Ground allow it multiple chances to fire off attacks or set up Swords Dance. Access to the coveted STAB Ice Shard allows Abomasnow to revenge a whole host of offensive threats, such as Zygarde-10%, Noivern, Roserade, and Virizion. Despite this, numerous common weaknesses mean Abomasnow can be offensively pressured easily. Also, Abomasnow is excruciatingly slow, so it needs considerable Speed investment to outpace most defensive Pokemon and is incapable of outspeeding the majority of offensive Pokemon; even with maximum Speed investment, Abomasnow is unable to outspeed Pokemon such as Umbreon and Porygon2 unless it uses a Speed-boosting nature. Abomasnow is also susceptible to all entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock, which, alongside a recoil-causing STAB move in Wood Hammer, can lead to it being worn down quickly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sets with Substitute can be used, as they allow Abomasnow to be less prediction reliant and whittle down its checks with residual damage—however, Abomasnow's most common checks are already exceedingly easy to wear down, especially thanks to hail damage, and this set requires it give up a valuable moveslot. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed is an option on the Swords Dance set, which allows Abomasnow to outspeed uninvested Umbreon and Porygon2 and allows it to hit them with a Wood Hammer before they can retaliate. However, the drop in power is very noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon, such as Salazzle and Arcanine, resist both of Abomasnow's STAB types and threaten to outspeed and OHKO it. Do note that they often do not appreciate coming into Blizzard or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Escavalier, Bronzong, and Registeel resist both of Abomasnow's STAB moves and take little from its coverage and thus stop Abomasnow in its tracks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Bewear, Machamp, Toxicroak, and Pangoro all outspeed Abomasnow and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves. However, they are generally unable to switch in to Abomasnow's STAB moves, with Bewear only coming in on Wood Hammer and Machamp into Blizzard reliably.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Neutral Pokemon</strong>: Despite Abomasnow's expansive coverage, there are still some defensive Pokemon that can switch into it effectively, such as Snorlax, and Porygon2, thanks to them taking neutral damage from Abomasnow's STAB moves and not enough from coverage. Umbreon and Porygon2 in particular are the most reliable stops to both Abomasnow sets, as they outspeed even maximum Speed neutral natured Abomasnow, avoid being 2HKOed by mixed Abomasnow's strongest option against them in Focus Blast, and do huge damage in return with Foul Play, especially if Abomasnow has boosted with Swords Dance. It is worth noting, however, that some such checks have their recovery diminished by hail.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Thanks to Abomasnow's myriad weaknesses and abysmal Speed, many of the offensive Pokemon in the tier, such as Raikou and Ribombee can threaten an OHKO with coverage such as Aura Sphere and Hidden Power Fire. However, it is worth noting that most such Pokemon are unable to reliably switch in to Abomasnow, and many Pokemon, such as Roserade and Nidoqueen, that can threaten Abomasnow this way are weak to Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Susceptibility to all hazards, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and a primary STAB move that causes recoil all cause Abomasnow to be worn down rather quickly.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Abomasnow's Attack to incredible levels, making it extremely difficult to come into safely. Wood Hammer is an immensely powerful STAB move with few reliable switch-ins. Ice Shard slightly patches up Abomasnow's poor Speed and gives it some sort of defense versus faster threats, and it also gives it a way to clean weakened teams. Earthquake hits Steel- and Fire-types for more damage than anything else that Abomasnow has to offer.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Investing 252 EVs into Speed lets Abomasnow outpace uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Registeel and other threats such as Dragalge and Rhyperior. The investment also allows base Abomasnow to outspeed uninvested Milotic so that it OHKOes Milotic with Wood Hammer before it can potentially be burned by Scald. Soundproof gives base Abomasnow the ability to pivot into attacks like Swellow's Boomburst.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Swords Dance on Pokemon threatened by Abomasnow's STAB moves, such as Rhyperior, Donphan, and Roserade. Abomasnow can also use its decent resistances and solid bulk to set up on a few offensive Pokemon, such as Zygarde-10% and Shaymin. After setting up, Abomasnow is devastatingly strong; use its immense power to blow huge holes in the opposition. Swords Dance Abomasnow can punish teams that rely on Registeel to check Abomasnow, as it is not a reliable answer to this set. Abomasnow can also function as a late-game cleaner with Swords Dance-boosted Ice Shard, so preserving it to do so is not a bad idea. Abomasnow has a few qualities that give choosing when to Mega Evolve a strategic component, such as choosing to Mega Evolve after an opposing weather setter has hit the field to disrupt the opposing team, or holding off on doing so to hit Milotic with Wood Hammer before it is able to attack. Be wary when switching Abomasnow into Pokemon that use sound moves, as they are all capable of OHKOing Abomasnow—some examples are Swellow with Heat Wave and Yanmega with Air Slash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Abomasnow set focuses on breaking through balance teams; as such, cleaners such as Zygarde-10%, Swellow, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir take advantage of the holes Abomasnow leaves in the opposition. Fire-type checks, such as Milotic, Flygon, Tyrantrum, and Rhyperior, are essential to cover Abomasnow's crippling Fire weakness. Partners with hazard control such as Mandibuzz and Flygon help to mitigate Abomasnow's weakness to entry hazards. Checks to Fighting-types such as Noivern, Slowbro, and Xatu are recommended to cover Abomasnow's other major weakness. Teammates that share mutual checks like Registeel with Abomasnow, including Gardevoir, Shaymin, and Goodra, appreciate Abomasnow's ability to heavily dent their mutual checks. Choice Scarf Tyrantrum is an especially notable partner, as it easily checks one of the biggest Fire-type threats in Salazzle and is extremely potent after opposing bulky Steel-types are weakened or removed by Abomasnow. Pokemon to draw in bulky Water- and Grass-types, such as Araquanid and Flygon, bring in the type of Pokemon that Abomasnow can set up on well.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is a powerful STAB move with no drawbacks under hail and few reliable switch-ins. Wood Hammer is another strong STAB move that nails Water-types that resist Blizzard. Giga Drain is less powerful, but it has the boon of giving Abomasnow more longevity, allowing it to come onto the field more often. Ice Shard somewhat mitigates Abomasnow's crippling Speed, and it is especially valuable in picking off threats such as Swellow, Roserade, Zygarde-10%, and Flygon. Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Registeel and Bronzong and is Abomasnow's strongest tool versus Porygon2, Snorlax, and Umbreon, which otherwise wall it. Earthquake is an option to hit Steel- and Fire-types with more reliable accuracy, with the cost of being weaker versus all relevant Steel-types and missing out on Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Snorlax.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>164 Speed EVs allow Abomasnow to outpace uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon, most notably Registeel. Maximum Special Attack gives Abomasnow's primary STAB move, Blizzard, the most power; a Rash or Mild nature being used so that the power of Ice Shard and Earthquake is not compromised, and not weakening its ability to switch into Pokemon such as Zygarde-10% and Donphan in the case of Rash variants, while Mild variants can more comfortably switch into threats like Raikou and Slowbro. The rest of the EVs go into Attack, guaranteeing that Registeel is 3HKOed by Earthquake and that Flygon is KOed by the combination of Ice Shard and hail damage. Soundproof is used as the ability, as it can potentially give Abomasnow free switches into attacks such as Swellow's Boomburst and Yanmega's Bug Buzz, although both have super-effective coverage that can heavily weaken Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Abomasnow into weaker attacks, especially those it resists, such as Steelix's Earthquake and Milotic's Scald, and use its powerful STAB moves to break down teams. However, be wary of Scald burns if using Wood Hammer. Note that Earthquake is only necessary to use for Fire- and Steel-types aside from Bronzong; otherwise, prioritize throwing out stronger STAB attacks. Ice Shard is a fantastic tool that allows Abomasnow to threaten a lot of Pokemon that would otherwise be unafraid of it, especially faster Ice-weak Pokemon such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Flygon. Abomasnow has a few qualities that give choosing when to Mega Evolve a strategic component, such as choosing to Mega Evolve after an opposing weather setter has hit the field to disrupt the opposing team, or remaining in base forme to hit Milotic with a Grass-type move before it is able to attack. Note that outspeeding minimum Speed Milotic with non-Mega Abomasnow requires 172 Speed EVs. Be wary when switching Abomasnow into Pokemon that use sound moves, as they are all capable of OHKOing Abomasnow—Swellow with Heat Wave and Ribombee with Hidden Power Fire are some examples.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-type checks such as Snorlax, Diancie, and Dragalge are able to switch into the greatest threats to Abomasnow. Checks to Fighting-types such as Uxie, Golbat, and Gardevoir are recommended to cover Abomasnow's other major weakness. Partners with hazard control such as Sigilyph and Espeon help to mitigate Abomasnow's weakness to entry hazards. Cleaners such as Zygarde-10%, Swellow, and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum make good teammates to take advantage of the holes Abomasnow leaves in the opposition. Pokemon to draw in bulky Water- and Grass-types, such as Metagross and Flygon, bring in the type of Pokemon that Abomasnow can switch in to well. U-turn or Volt Switch users like Uxie, Raikou, and Flygon are useful to give Abomasnow more opportunities to get on the field.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior's combination of physical bulk, useful resistances, and offensive presence lets it be an effective Stealth Rock setter on offensive teams. A Rock / Ground typing makes for a fearsome STAB combination that enables it to threaten one of the most common Stealth Rock setters in Registeel and force a decent number of switches, especially if opting to wallbreak with its Choice Band set. Said typing also provides some great resistances in Fire, Flying, and Rock, making Rhyperior a good check to the likes of Salazzle, Noivern, and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum. Solid Rock somewhat makes up for Rhyperior's many weaknesses by letting it take a super effective hit from threats like Nidoqueen and +1 Zygarde-10% to KO back. However, it's easily forced out by common Pokemon like Milotic and Shaymin, which can be vexing for offensive teams to switch into. A lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and pathetic Speed make Rhyperior easy for strong attackers to pick off mid- or late-game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rhyperior's Solid Rock means it can make decent use of Metal Burst to lure and KO almost any attacker, but its own attacks are usually strong and reliable enough.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water</strong>: All Pokemon that use Water-type attacks, including Milotic, Mega Blastoise, and Barbaracle, threaten Rhyperior with an easy KO. Milotic is the only one that can switch in on Rhyperior's attacks with consistency, however, and even it is in trouble against the Choice Band set.</p> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Grass-types like Shaymin, Tsareena, and Virizion can switch in on Stealth Rock or Earthquake and easily take Rhyperior out. Roserade and users of Grass-type coverage like Ninetales can similarly deal massive damage but aren't able to safely come in on a STAB attack. No Grass-type likes taking Megahorn or Ice Punch on the switch, either.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Particularly bulky Pokemon that aren't weak to one of Rhyperior's STAB moves like Milotic, Cresselia, and Bronzong can keep Stealth Rock sets at bay, and only Cresselia lacks means to deal with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: The likes of Bewear, Pangoro, and Machamp would rather not take Earthquake on the switch, but they outspeed Rhyperior and threaten major damage to it and its team.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Rhyperior has no recovery options except Leftovers, so poison quickly eliminates its ability to take hits. Burns don't occur often thanks to how threatening Scald already is to Rhyperior, but they'll leave it even easier to exploit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a must on any offensive team, and Rhyperior can use its bulk to set it up pretty reliably. Earthquake is the go-to STAB move for its great coverage and power. Rock Blast hits most of what Earthquake can't, including Flying- and Bug-types, and can mess with users of Focus Sash or Substitute; Megahorn is an alternative to pressure Grass-types, Bronzong, and Mandibuzz on a Roost. Toxic annoys Water-types and various defensive Pokemon, while Swords Dance lets Rhyperior beat walls more directly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Near-maximum HP and Special Defense investment optimizes Leftovers recovery and improves Rhyperior's ability to take special hits; 16 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature give Rhyperior an extra point in Attack thanks to stat calculation quirks. Running 84 Speed EVs is an option to let Rhyperior hit Registeel before it can use Toxic. Solid Rock is easily the best ability because it lets Rhyperior take a super effective hit from all but the strongest attackers. Leftovers means Rhyperior can get maximum use out of its bulk; Rindo Berry is an option to let a healthy Rhyperior tank boosted Grass-type coverage like Ninetales's Solar Beam and Salazzle's Hidden Power Grass. Another option in Rockium Z with Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Megahorn gives Rhyperior a great matchup against teams with multiple Defoggers, a way to nuke common switch-ins like Mega Blastoise, Shaymin, and Milotic, and reduced damage from Knock Off users like Drapion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Rhyperior tends to be straightforward; switch in on Pokemon it can take attacks from like Noivern, Salazzle, and Electric-types to force them out and set Stealth Rock up. If a threatening entry hazard remover like Mega Blastoise is on the opponent's team, it may be more productive to use an appropriate attack as it switches in rather than setting Stealth Rock just to get forced out. Similarly, walls like Milotic and Cresselia can be hindered by Toxic on the switch. Rhyperior's HP should be preserved if it's the only thing keeping a threat like Zygarde-10% or Tyrantrum from sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types like Shaymin, Roserade, and Virizion make up for Rhyperior's pressing Water weakness; Shaymin and Roserade in particular can use Synthesis to be consistent answers to the likes of Milotic and Mega Blastoise. Fire- and Dragon-types like Salazzle, Ninetales, Dragalge, and Goodra are options for dealing with Grass-types, though none is perfect at it. Fire-types also address Bronzong. Fast Pokemon like Noivern and Swellow threaten speedy offensive teams, which easily overwhelm Rhyperior; Choice Scarf Gardevoir can do the same as well as check Fighting-types and make Rhyperior a threat late-game with Healing Wish. Taunt users like Mandibuzz, Noivern, and Mismagius beat walls and create chances for Rhyperior to set Swords Dance up; Noivern also switches into Grass-types without worrying about them risking coverage moves thanks to Swords Dance Rhyperior's threatening presence, and Mismagius can spinblock.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake and Stone Edge are Rhyperior's optimal STAB moves. Megahorn deals massive damage to bulky Psychic-types like Bronzong and Cresselia. Ice Punch can be a safer move to lock into that still hits Grass-types thanks to good coverage and accuracy. Rock Blast can be used as a safer alternative to Stone Edge, but it lacks any specific use outside of getting more damage on Substitute users. Superpower can threaten Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-type walls without being as easy to switch into as Earthquake. Rock Wrecker's recharge turn can be justified by its sheer power, most notably always OHKOing Milotic after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rhyperior uses 204 Speed EVs to outpace Umbreon and all slower walls. Solid Rock lets Rhyperior tank super effective physical hits and KO back. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature can be threatening with Sticky Web support.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Like most wallbreakers, Rhyperior's at its best when aggressively switched in on predicted Pokemon it can threaten such as Steel-, Flying-, and Fire-types. Coverage moves should be used on switches to checks expecting the more common and stoppable Stealth Rock set like Bronzong, Shaymin, and Milotic. Preserving Rhyperior's health for mid- or late-game can let it take a hit from a valuable attacker and KO back.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set's lack of Stealth Rock mandates other setters such as Registeel and Bronzong, which also handle a good number of Pokemon Rhyperior's vulnerable to. Cleaners that benefit from weakened Steel-types like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Z-Celebrate Shaymin are sensible choices. Swellow is a particularly great option; the only Pokemon that consistently switch into its Boomburst are Rock- and Steel-types, which it can just use U-turn on to give Rhyperior a free switch. Rhyperior's ability to KO Milotic is good news for attackers like Mega Blastoise and Z-Crystal sweepers, the latter of which won't have to spend their Z-Move on it. In general, Rhyperior's team should make up for its lacking Speed and have switch-ins to Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-types in case they get in for free. Paralysis or Sticky Web support from Pokemon like Porygon2 and Araquanid in particular makes Rhyperior much more threatening to offensive teams.</p>"

  "Yanmega": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Tinted Lens making Yanmega's STAB moves a lot more spammable, it can act as a fantastic Choice Specs wallbreaker against bulkier and slower teams. Yanmega also has access to Speed Boost, which makes it a solid sweeper against frailer offensive teams, which generally don't carry the means to properly deal with it defensively nor offensively. Yanmega's typing is pretty bad defensively, however, as it leaves Yanmega weak to common offensive Fire-, Ice-, Electric-, Rock-, and Flying-types like Salazzle, Mega Abomasnow, Raikou, Rhyperior, and Ninetales. Its typing also gives it a hefty weakness to Stealth Rock, which cuts away 50% of its health upon switching in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tailwind can be used on Yanmega's Choice Specs set instead of U-turn or Giga Drain to support its team, but it's a rather poor option because U-turn and Giga Drain offer more utility in most cases. Shadow Ball can be used on Speed Boost sets because it gives Yanmega a good way to hit Pokemon like Bronzong and Gardevoir for super effective damage while also offering nice neutral coverage against a lot of Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Porygon2, Florges, Snorlax, and Gigalith can wall Yanmega with ease and either cripple it with Toxic and stall it out of health or just knock it out with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock cuts 50% of Yanmega's HP, putting it in KO range of a lot of attacks. Common Stealth Rock setters like Diancie, Gigalith, and Registeel can even set up Stealth Rock on Yanmega.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Forretress and Escavalier can absorb most hits from Speed Boost Yanmega, but they tend to struggle with the Choice Specs set a lot more. Registeel deserves its own special mention because of its ability to take hits from the Choice Specs set as well as the Speed Boost set, but its lack of reliable recovery means it gets worn down rather quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is Yanmega's strongest STAB move and does a ton of damage to Pokemon that aren't specially defensive walls. Air Slash is Yanmega's secondary STAB move; while less powerful than Bug Buzz, it allows Yanmega to deal with Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Assault Vest Hariyama. U-turn allows Yanmega to take advantage of switches and gain momentum for its team against Pokemon like Gigalith and Porygon2; U-turn can also rack up damage to allow Yanmega to 2HKO certain Pokemon later. Giga Drain lets Yanmega OHKO Rhyperior and 2HKO non-specially defensive Milotic, the latter after Stealth Rock damage. Psychic is able to OHKO both Nidoqueen and offensive Roserade and 2HKO Dragalge, which Yanmega fails to achieve with any other move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment in conjunction with a Timid nature maximizes Yanmega's offensive potential and allows it to outspeed and threaten Roserade, Rotom-C, and anything slower. Tinted Lens means Yanmega doesn't have to worry about Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, and when used with Choice Specs, it allows Yanmega to properly wallbreak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Yanmega to punch holes into bulky teams and clear the path for teammates to clean up. This Yanmega set wants to be spamming Bug Buzz, but it may be more beneficial to use Air Slash or Giga Drain when the opponent has certain Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Rhyperior. U-turn should be used minimally and only if Yanmega is forcing a switch and it is beneficial to gain momentum instead of firing off an attack. Prevent Yanmega from switching into Stealth Rock, as this will significantly damage it, putting it in KO range of a lot of attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Donphan is essential, since Yanmega loses around 50% of its health from switching into Stealth Rock. Xatu and Espeon also deserve a mention because they're able to consistently keep hazards off the field thanks to their ability, Magic Bounce. While Yanmega doesn't like getting chipped down by entry hazards itself, it appreciates entry hazards on the opposing side of the field, since Yanmega forces switches into its common answers like Registeel and Porygon2, allowing the entry hazards to chip away at their health. On bulkier teams, Pokemon such as Dragalge and Bronzong are able to consistently provide hazard support for Yanmega. For more offensive teams, Mega Glalie, Roserade, and Nidoqueen are able to pressure common forms of hazard removal to ensure their hazards stay up on the field. Late-game cleaners like Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%, Curse Snorlax, Toxicroak, and Nasty Plot Salazzle can break through the opposing team once Yanmega has made way for them to do so; they're also able to pressure Steel-types for Yanmega. Pokemon that have similar checks to Yanmega, like Necrozma, Gardevoir, Dragalge, and Snorlax, can overwhelm checks that they have in common.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect prevents Yanmega from being damaged, grants it a free Speed boost, and allows it to scout for Z-Moves. Bug Buzz is Yanmega's strongest STAB move, capable of hitting Dark- and Psychic-types like Umbreon, Necrozma, and Cresselia for super effective damage and ignoring Substitute. Air Slash is Yanmega's secondary STAB move and allows it to beat Pokemon like Bewear. Giga Drain heals Life Orb damage and lets Yanmega OHKO Rhyperior. Psychic can be used to hit Nidoqueen and Dragalge, which can take any other hit from this set and retaliate with a strong move, potentially OHKOing Yanmega. Hidden Power Ice nails Noivern.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment in conjunction with a Modest nature maximizes Yanmega's offensive potential; there's no reason to run a Timid nature, since Speed Boost will consistently make Yanmega faster. Speed Boost allows Yanmega to outspeed the whole unboosted tier after just one activation and as well as some of the boosted tier like Choice Scarf Gardevoir if it hasn't copied Speed Boost. Life Orb provides Yanmega with a major power boost, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO a large portion of the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Yanmega should be used as a wincon against frailer, more offensively oriented teams and can also be used as a late-game cleaner against bulkier teams. Use Protect to get a free Speed boost whenever attempting to sweep with Yanmega unless it is against Pokemon like Zygarde-10% because they might use the free turn to set up. Try to keep Yanmega healthy early-game, only bringing it in whenever it can revenge kill a weakened Pokemon. Prevent Yanmega from switching in to Stealth Rock, as this will significantly damage it, putting it in KO range of a lot of attacks, even its own Life Orb recoil if it has to fire off five attacks. Yanmega has trouble taking even neutral hits because of its rather lacking defensive stats, so prevent it from taking too much unnecessary damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Tsareena, Mandibuzz, and Mega Blastoise is mandatory with Yanmega due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Yanmega may not like entry hazards on its own side of the field, but it definitely likes to have them on the opposing side of the field, especially Spikes, since they allow Yanmega to pick up quite a few KOs that it otherwise just misses out on. Pokemon like Necrozma, Roserade, and Dragalge are capable of setting up entry hazards for Yanmega. Nidoqueen and Salazzle are able to beat a lot of Yanmega's common answers in Florges and Registeel; Nidoqueen can also set up Stealth Rock, aiding Yanmega with sweeping. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Feraligatr, Choice Band Zygarde-10%, and Choice Band Snorlax can weaken the opposing team for Yanmega and allow it to sweep more easily. Pokemon that can set up hail or sand like Abomasnow and Gigalith are excellent teammates because they negate Leftovers recovery from checks to Yanmega, potentially allowing it to break through them.</p>"

  "Rotom-Mow": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-C is a marginally threatening attacker that can utilize its passable offensive stats and support options to function as an offensive pivot. Its typing, ability, and access to Will-O-Wisp also give it a slight niche as a Defogger, as it can check certain Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross, Rhyperior, Diancie, and Gigalith while being immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. However, Rotom-C's unremarkable STAB combination leaves it unable to threaten prevalent Grass-, Poison-, and Dragon-types like Mega Sceptile, Shaymin, Roserade, Goodra, and Dragalge, while its defensive typing leaves it open to common offensive threats such as Golisopod, Salazzle, and Ninetales. Rotom-C also cannot break through various special walls such as Florges, Cresselia, Bronzong, and Registeel, as it lacks ways to boost its Special Attack and relies heavily on Leaf Storm for an attacking option. Many of Rotom-C's best checks are also common entry hazard setters, which hinders its viability as a Defogger. Rotom-C also lacks much defensive utility, as its average bulk and lack of reliable recovery make it easy to wear down and limit its opportunities to use Defog, and it can't make use of Levitate, since most Ground-types like Zygarde-10%, Nidoqueen, and Gastrodon have a way of hitting or crippling it. Rotom-C faces major competition with other Electric- and Grass-types like Raikou, Shaymin, and Virizion, which tend to offer a better offensive presence with their superior stats, coverage, or ability to set up. Tsareena notably gives it competition as a Grass-type entry hazard remover, as its superior movepool and offensive stats allow it to threaten a wider array of Pokemon while having a reliable form of recovery, giving it the longevity it needs to consistently perform its role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iapapa Berry slightly improves Rotom-C's longevity, which gives it more opportunities to use Defog at the cost of the power that Grassium Z provides. Dream Eater in conjunction with Psychium Z allows Rotom-C to lure in and remove Poison-types that can usually wall it such as Roserade and Dragalge, but Dream Eater is entirely useless after the Z-Move has been used, making its use incredibly situational and prediction reliant. Toxic is an option over Will-O-Wisp that cripples special walls like Cresselia and Porygon2, though Will-O-Wisp offers much better utility in crippling Pokemon such as Metagross and Virizion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass- and Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Roserade, Shaymin, Dragalge, and Mega Sceptile are able to counter Rotom-C due to their resistances to its STAB moves. Mega Sceptile can notably deny Volt Switch with Lightning Rod, while Roserade and Dragalge can OHKO Rotom-C with their respective Poison-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Salazzle, Ninetales, Houndoom, and Arcanine can all outspeed and OHKO Rotom-C with Fire Blast or Flare Blitz. Houndoom and Arcanine can also punish the use of Will-O-Wisp with Flash Fire.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Virizion, and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum can outspeed and pick off a weakened Rotom-C. Golisopod and Mega Abomasnow are especially notable, as they boast super effective priority moves against it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Rotom-C struggles to break through walls like Florges, Cresselia, and Porygon2, which can retaliate with Toxic. Registeel and Bronzong deserve special mentions because they're Stealth Rock users that can beat Rotom-C easily, though it can use Volt Switch against all of these Pokemon to preserve momentum.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because of Rotom-C's average bulk, it can take excessive amounts of damage switching into Stealth Rock or into entry hazard setters like Gigalith and Rhyperior, which can chip at it with Stone Edge or Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-C to generate momentum for its team while chipping various Pokemon that can usually switch into it such as Roserade and Registeel. Will-O-Wisp enables Rotom-C to cripple threats like Metagross while preventing the likes of Virizion and Tsareena from switching in for free. Thunderbolt is an alternative STAB option that doesn't force Rotom-C to switch out and allows it to consistently take on foes such as Mandibuzz, though this sacrifices the utility provided by Will-O-Wisp. With Stealth Rock support, Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Mega Sceptile and 2HKO Tangela while also dealing a considerable amount of damage to checks like offensive Roserade. However, this also forces Rotom-C to replace a useful utility option and doesn't do sufficient damage to targets such as Goodra and Shaymin, while Synthesis variations of Shaymin and Roserade can heal off damage quite easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed alongside a Timid nature is preferred so that Rotom-C can apply the most offensive pressure possible while outspeeding foes like Nidoqueen and Mega Blastoise. Grassium Z in conjunction with Leaf Storm gives Rotom-C a powerful one-time STAB move, which can OHKO Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Gardevoir after Stealth Rock damage while preventing Leaf Storm's stat reduction penalty.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Find opportunities to use Defog against entry hazard setters threatened by Rotom-C like Rhyperior, Gigalith, Diancie, and Steelix, which are usually forced out, though Rotom-C must be cautious when pivoting into these Pokemon, as they can cripple it with Toxic or chip it with their STAB moves. Pokemon like Metagross and Milotic are also targets that Rotom-C can take advantage of and use Defog against. Despite this, Rotom-C's average bulk and lack of recovery options make it rather easy to wear down, so it should exercise caution when directly switching into Stealth Rock users like Gigalith and Rhyperior, which can do significant damage with Stone Edge or Megahorn. Volt Switch will often be Rotom-C's attacking move of choice to generate momentum against switch-ins like Roserade and Goodra. Once such answers have been eliminated, Rotom-C can more freely use Leaf Storm, especially in tandem with Grassium Z to take out offensive threats like Gardevoir and Machamp. Be cautious when using Will-O-Wisp, as it can activate Flash Fire on Houndoom and Arcanine or make the special walls that like to switch into Rotom-C like Cresselia and Porygon2 immune to Toxic, which can be detrimental to teams that rely on status to wear them down. Similarly, Leaf Storm's stat reduction can make Rotom-C vulnerable to various wallbreakers and setup sweepers like Machamp, Necrozma, and Raikou.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-, Steel-, and Psychic-types like Salazzle, Metagross, and Gardevoir can exploit the Grass- and Poison-types Rotom-C can force into play like Roserade and Dragalge, and they appreciate the support provided by Volt Switch. Other Fire-types like Ninetales in addition to Flying- and Bug-types such as Noivern and Golisopod greatly appreciate Rotom-C's ability to remove Stealth Rock with Defog while threatening Rock-type entry hazard setters such as Gigalith and Diancie. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Machamp, Zygarde-10%, and Toxicroak can form an offensive core with Rotom-C, as they can clear away Pokemon that trouble it, which includes special walls like Registeel and Snorlax as well as Fire-, Poison, and Ice-types such as Houndoom, Dragalge, and Mega Abomasnow. In return, these Pokemon appreciate having physical walls like Slowbro disposed of. Setup sweepers like Virizion and Barbaracle can also take advantage of Pokemon crippled by Will-O-Wisp such as Metagross. Pokemon like Raikou, Machamp, and Necrozma can take advantage of Rotom-C after its Special Attack is lowered by Leaf Storm, so teammates like Registeel, Florges, and Drapion are respective checks to these Pokemon that prevent them from completely exploiting Rotom-C.</p>"

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Uxie is mostly overlooked in favor of its bulkier Psychic-type cousin Cresselia, it can act as a useful pivot and Stealth Rock user, which is enough to earn a niche. Its enormous supportive movepool, which features Yawn, U-turn, Memento, Knock Off, and Thunder Wave, makes it a very versatile Pokemon that can freely choose moves and EV spreads to accommodate its team's weaknesses. A high Speed stat for a defensive Pokemon allows it to potentially outspeed several threats to beat them with ease, such as Toxicroak, Roserade, and Nidoqueen. Uxie fits on offensive and bulky offensive teams that need a Fighting- and Poison-type counter that can avoid passivity issues, unlike Cresselia. Its ability to facilitate setup from the likes of Barbaracle and Slurpuff also makes it a great pick on these archetypes. Its great ability in Levitate can let it switch into dangerous Ground-types like Flygon and Nidoqueen. It also has a great matchup against opposing offensive teams, as it is able to quickly disrupt their momentum with Yawn and U-turn. However, despite having Yawn and U-turn to combat its passivity, Uxie's mediocre and uninvested Special Attack means its attacks are still very weak, which is an issue against Pokemon that don't mind being put to sleep, like Snorlax and Calm Mind Cresselia. Although base 130 / 130 defenses are amazing, they are let down by its slightly mediocre HP stat. This makes it more vulnerable to moves such as Pursuit compared to Cresselia. Most importantly, however, despite its extensive movepool, Uxie has no way to reliably recover its HP. This makes it very hard to consistently check the threats it's supposed to throughout the entire match. Although Wiki Berry slightly alleviates this, it makes Uxie much more inconsistent on bulkier teams, where Cresselia is preferred and its passivity can be accommodated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Uxie has quite a broad support movepool, featuring rare and unique moves with different applications. For example, Imprison can block foes' Stealth Rock, U-turn, or Knock Off, which can prevent Stealth Rock from ever being up. Heal Bell lets Uxie act as a cleric for its team. A combination of Protect + Leftovers can let Uxie passively recover health throughout the match, as well as scouting for dangerous coverage, Z-Moves, and Pursuit. However, Protect takes away an important moveslot, and the quick recovery Wiki Berry offers is generally more applicable. Uxie can opt to run several coverage options to hit some of its counters. For example, Ice Punch can be used to hit Pokemon 4x weak to Ice like Zygarde-10%, Noivern, and Flygon. Hidden Power Fire or Fire Punch can be used to 2HKO Escavalier, Mega Abomasnow, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage. Dazzling Gleam has a chance to OHKO Pangoro after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Grass Knot hits Water-types, which makes setting Stealth Rock safer against Mega Blastoise. However, Uxie’s lacking offenses mean these moves can become a wasted moveslot if their targets are not present. A dual screens set can be used on hyper offense teams to support setup sweepers such as Espeon, Barbaracle, and Slurpuff, differentiating itself from other screens setters like Meowstic-M and Electrode thanks to its rare access to Memento.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon like Drapion, Sneasel, and Pangoro can switch into Uxie's Psychic STAB attacks due to their immunity and set up or heavily damage it with a super effective STAB Knock Off. If Uxie opts for Colbur Berry, however, it can easily take a hit and escape. Additionally, most need to watch out for Yawn and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to Uxie's lacking offenses, setup sweepers that don't mind being put to sleep like Snorlax or can avoid it via Substitute like Raikou can easily set up in front of Uxie.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Palossand, and Alolan Marowak can hit Uxie super effectively or set up on it. Knock Off significantly improves Uxie's matchup against these Pokemon, however.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit from the likes of Honchkrow, Drapion, and Escavalier can heavily damage or outright KO an Uxie trying to switch. However, Colbur Berry significantly lowers the damage taken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Yawn forces switches against most Pokemon, and combined with U-turn or Memento, it will often give you the upper hand. Even if the opposing Pokemon stays in, you can use this opportunity to set up or KO it. Yawn also prevents Uxie from being setup fodder to dangerous Pokemon such as Barbaracle and makes it a great emergency check to Pokemon that have already set up, like a +2 Pangoro and +1 Raikou. It also takes advantage of Uxie's Stealth Rock, as the opponent will be constantly switching. Memento is useful on offensive teams with teammates that appreciate easy setup, like Barbaracle and Zygarde-10%, although it should only be used once their checks have been whittled down.</p> <p>Knock Off is a useful support move to remove key items such as Registeel's Leftovers. If running Knock Off, Uxie should run Zen Headbutt in conjunction with a Jolly nature. Thunder Wave can be used over Yawn to slow down threats immediately. However, slower threats like Escavalier, Alolan Marowak, and Diancie tend to not mind paralysis as much, and it is much less effective against Electric- and Ground-types, like Raikou and Flygon. Most importantly, though, Thunder Wave cannot force as many switches as Yawn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Wiki Berry provides a burst of recovery once Uxie's HP drops below 25%. This is useful because Uxie will often be switching into attacks and taking Stealth Rock damage. The 50% recovery drastically improves its longevity and helps it check Pokemon like Medicham throughout the game. Alternatively, Colbur Berry can serve as a safety net against Knock Off and Pursuit users like Escavalier. However, Uxie does not appreciate not having any recovery to speak of. The given EV spread has enough Speed investment to outspeed Roserade with the remainder put in Defense. However, there are many other EV spreads that Uxie can use to support specific teams. If Roserade is not an issue, it can run 176 EVs to outspeed Toxicroak. Other important speed benchmarks include Timid and Modest Nidoqueen, Medicham, Adamant Honchkrow, and TauntTox Mandibuzz. Special Defense investment can also be used if Uxie's primary goal is to check Poison-types such as Nidoqueen rather than Fighting-types. Levitate is Uxie's only ability, and it helps Uxie switch into Ground-types like Flygon with ease.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prioritize setting up Stealth Rock early-game. Because Uxie forces many switches, the earlier you can set it, the more damage will rack up on the opposing Pokemon. Due to Uxie's access to U-turn and solid matchup against opposing Stealth Rock users, it can function as a consistent lead. Later, Uxie can function as a pivot by switching into moves it resists. Its high bulk can also let it sponge neutral and even some weak super effective attacks, but remember that Uxie has no reliable recovery, so this should be avoided unless Uxie has done its job and isn't necessary anymore. At this point, Uxie can start to disrupt the opponent's momentum with Yawn and U-turn. Try to predict if the opponent will switch to a Dark-type or Pursuit trapper like Drapion and escape the situation by using U-turn. Alternatively, if running Colbur Berry, Uxie can surprise Pursuit trappers by staying in and using Yawn, forcing them into a mind game with an upper hand. Yawn should be used to force switches and cripple setup sweepers, forcing them to forgo their boosts or stay in and fall asleep. However, you shouldn't spam Yawn, as the opponent might just use one of their Pokemon as sleep fodder and make Uxie a lot less threatening.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers, like Dragon Dance Zygarde, Barbaracle, and Slurpuff, appreciate Uxie's ability to bait in passive Pokemon, disrupt momentum, set up Stealth Rock, and grant setup opportunities. Additionally, these Pokemon can set up on Pokemon locked into Pursuit, like Drapion and Escavalier, and help patch up Uxie's passive nature. Fairy-types like Florges and Slurpuff and Fighting-types like Virizion and Bewear can beat the Dark-types Uxie struggles with and switch into some Bug-types like Golisopod. Entry hazard setters such as Roserade, Mega Glalie, and Golisopod benefit from Uxie's ability to force switches, racking up substantial damage on the opposing Pokemon. Other U-turn or Volt Switch users, like Flygon and Raikou, can form a VoltTurn core with Uxie. Frail wallbreakers such as Medicham, Roserade, and Swellow, appreciate the slow U-turn support for a free switch in.</p>"

  "Shaymin": {
    "overview": "<p>Shaymin's well-rounded stats, ability to run a variety of sets, and absurdly powerful signature move in Seed Flare make it a big threat in the RU metagame. Its extensive movepool including recovery in Synthesis and Leech Seed, utility in Healing Wish, and a plethora of coverage options makes it difficult to check. Seed Flare's large chance to lower the foe's Special Defense allows Shaymin to easily pressure bulkier threats that would typically check it such as Snorlax and Cresselia. Shaymin's access to Natural Cure and recovery allows it to pressure defensive teams even more. Due to its very good bulk for an offensive Pokemon, it is able to fit seamlessly onto offensive teams and check Water- and Ground-types such as Mega Blastoise, Milotic, and Rhyperior. Natural Cure also allows it to absorb crippling status ailments such as poison and burn for its teammates. However, Shaymin's Seed Flare suffers from low accuracy and is easily PP stalled, and Shaymin lacks the power to break through bulky teams without getting Special Defense drops from Seed Flare. Shaymin also has difficulty fitting the coverage it needs and recovery all onto one set. Finally, despite its decent Speed, it is outsped and revenge killed by common threats such as Salazzle and Noivern.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shaymin has a lot of other options to consider due to its extensive movepool. Grassium Z is an option that allows Shaymin to fire off an extremely powerful and accurate Bloom Doom to muscle past its checks. However, by using this, Shaymin loses power on its vital coverage moves. Choice Specs could be used to boost Shaymin's Special Attack to extremely high levels, but it is extremely prediction-reliant, making it difficult to take advantage of the threatening coverage Shaymin has access to. Shaymin can use Tailwind to support slower teammates, but it is an unreliable strategy and coverage is typically better. Aromatherapy is an option for Shaymin if its teammates are easily crippled by status, but its Natural Cure ability is often enough for status absorption, and coverage is usually more useful. Leech Seed can be run on the offensive set to help with threats such as Umbreon, but more reliable recovery is typically more appreciated. Energy Ball on the Choice Scarf set is a much more reliable STAB move than Seed Flare and can revenge kill threats without risking a miss. However, Shaymin is pressed for moveslots as it is. Finally, Air Slash on offensive sets hits opposing Shaymin for the most damage while also hitting Virizion, Venusaur, and Roserade. However, besides Virizion and opposing Shaymin, those Pokemon are hit harder by Psychic, so this coverage is nearly always useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: It is difficult for Shaymin to break through very bulky special walls such as Cresselia, Umbreon, Porygon2, and Goodra unless it gets Special Defense drops from Seed Flare. Goodra is an especially good check due to its immunity to Seed Flare and Leech Seed. Similarly, Bronzong and Escavalier wall sets without Hidden Power Fire. In return, these Pokemon can recover off the damage, heal their teammates, or threaten Shaymin with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong can take any hit from Shaymin with ease and weaken it in return. Registeel is only pressured by Life Orb Earth Power and cannot have its Special Defense lowered. Escavalier and Metagross are also decent checks, but they are pressured by certain coverage.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Honchkrow, Yanmega, and Swellow can switch into Shaymin's Seed Flare and threaten it with their STAB moves; however, most of them cannot switch into Shaymin many times and are easily pressured by Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Salazzle, can switch in on Seed Flare easily and OHKO Shaymin but are vulnerable to coverage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seed Flare is the main reason to use Shaymin, since it hits extremely hard and can pressure bulkier teams easily due to its high chance to lower the foe's Special Defense. However, it is vulnerable to PP stalling. Earth Power hits Steel-types like Metagross and Registeel the hardest. Hidden Power Ice keeps Noivern from switching in freely and deals decent damage to Grass-types. Synthesis allows Shaymin to consistently switch into threats throughout the match and negates damage from entry hazards. Rest is similar to Synthesis in that it keeps Shaymin healthy, and it works nicely in conjunction with Natural Cure negating sleep; however, although it does restore more HP than Synthesis, has more PP, and is not hindered by sand, it loses momentum by requiring Shaymin to switch out after use. Dazzling Gleam is an option to hit Goodra and Mandibuzz for more damage; it also prevents Umbreon from PP stalling Seed Flare.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed increases Shaymin's offensive presence. Life Orb is used to further boost Shaymin's power, as while 100 Special Attack is good, it is not stellar. Natural Cure is Shaymin's only available ability, but it is useful to absorb status such as Toxic poison and Scald burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Shaymin into Pokemon that it checks, such as Milotic and Gigalith, to threaten them with Seed Flare. Sometimes, especially against bulkier threats such as Umbreon and Snorlax, it is beneficial to fish for Special Defense drops because Shaymin threatens nearly every -2 Pokemon in the tier. However, be careful of using Seed Flare too much; it is prone to being PP stalled. Use Synthesis in order to prevent Shaymin from being worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil so it can switch into Pokemon that it checks throughout the match. Beware of Seed Flare's low accuracy; it is not typically a reliable way to revenge kill Pokemon due to its chance to miss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shaymin struggles against extremely bulky special walls such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Snorlax if it does not get drops with Seed Flare. As a result, Pokemon that threaten these walls, such as Pangoro, Machamp, and Honchkrow, make for decent teammates. Fire-types such as Salazzle and Ninetales can threaten the Steel-types that switch into Shaymin. They also appreciate Shaymin's ability to switch into and threaten Water-types. Similarly, Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Aerodactyl, Flygon, and Cloyster are vulnerable to Water- and Ground-types so they appreciate Shaymin's ability to check them. Shaymin appreciates entry hazard support to wear down its checks and counters, so Stealth Rock from Nidoqueen and Registeel and Spikes from Mega Glalie are appreciated. Finally, slow setup sweepers such as Snorlax are decent partners, as Shaymin and they can easily wear down each other's checks and counters and they appreciate Shaymin's ability to outspeed strong wallbreakers with average Speed such as Bewear.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seed Flare is Shaymin's main STAB move; though it suffers from low accuracy and PP, its raw power and chance to drop the opposing Pokemon's Special Defense are invaluable. Healing Wish allows Shaymin to support its teammates by giving partners such as Nasty Plot Salazzle and Mismagius another chance to set up. Psychic dents Toxicroak, Roserade, and Virizion, which Shaymin fails to do much damage to otherwise. Hidden Power Ice revenge kills Swellow and Yanmega after Stealth Rock and Adamant Dragon Dance Flygon after some chip damage. Earth Power is an option to hit Steel- and Fire-types such as Metagross and Ninetales. Air Slash is a stronger alternative than Psychic to revenge kill Virizion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf allows Shaymin to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame. Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack gives Shaymin decent power and the ability to revenge kill many Pokemon in the tier. Finally, while Natural Cure is Shaymin's only ability, it is very useful for absorbing status such as Toxic poison and Scald burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Shaymin set should be used to either revenge kill opposing Pokemon or clean up after its checks and counters have been weakened. When faced with a threatening setup sweeper such as Zygarde-10%, the player may have to sacrifice a Pokemon in order to give a free switch to Shaymin and revenge kill the foe. Wear down checks and counters to Shaymin, such as Fire- and Steel-types, if your plan is to have it sweep late-game with Seed Flare. Switch Shaymin into a predicted Toxic or Scald in order to absorb the potential poison or burn for Shaymin's teammates. Additionally, use Healing Wish to revitalize a teammate that lacks recovery or is crippled by status. It can also give setup sweepers such as Agility Metagross a second chance to sweep. Despite this set's lack of recovery, it can still switch into Water-types like Mega Blastoise a few times. However, make these count by only switching in when necessary, as they are limited.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Shaymin set fits best on balanced or offensive teams that need its revenge killing capabilities or appreciate its ability to clean late-game. Setup sweepers or partners that are easily worn down, such as Flame Orb Machamp, Calm Mind Raikou, Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%, Salazzle, and Golisopod, appreciate the Healing Wish support that Shaymin can provide. Shaymin can also clean late-game, but in order to do this, its checks must be weakened. As a result, Shaymin appreciates entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, which a lot of its checks are weak to. Metagross, Gigalith, and Diancie can provide this support. Other Pokemon that wear down Shaymin's checks, such as Snorlax, Rhyperior, and Metagross, make good partners. Finally, since Shaymin outspeeds most other Choice Scarf users in the tier, Pokemon that are easily revenge killed by those Choice Scarf users such as Swellow, Toxicroak, and Aerodactyl appreciate Shaymin's ability to outspeed and KO them.</p>"
      },
      "Leech Seed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed is used to annoy typical switch-ins to Shaymin while acting as a passive form of recovery for it. Substitute is used in conjunction with Leech Seed to chip away at typical Shaymin checks such as Bronzong and Escavalier. This Shaymin set does not run a reliable recovery move because it is hard to fit coverage moves on Shaymin as it is. As a result, Protect can be used over Substitute in order to allow Shaymin to switch into threats such as Gigalith and Rhyperior throughout the match more reliably. It can also be used to scout for coverage and moves that Choice item users lock themselves into, which is useful against Choice Scarf Flygon and Gardevoir. Seed Flare is a very powerful STAB move that puts a lot of pressure on bulkier teams due to its chance to lower the foe's Special Defense. Air Slash hits the Grass-types that are not affected by Leech Seed, such as Roserade, Virizion, and opposing Shaymin, as well as Fighting- and Bug-types. Earth Power can be used to hit the Steel- and Fire-types that do not take much damage from Seed Flare, such as Metagross, Registeel, and Salazzle, whereas Psychic hits many threats for neutral damage and does more damage to Venusaur and Roserade than Air Slash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers synergizes with Leech Seed by allowing Shaymin to regain a decent portion of its HP every turn; this amount is typically nearly enough to make up for the HP lost to Substitute. Also, because this set does not use a reliable recovery move such as Synthesis, Leftovers is necessary to somewhat make up for that. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is used to give Shaymin some offensive presence. An EV spread with maximum HP and maximum Speed is an option, as it prevents Seismic Toss from breaking Shaymin's Substitute. However, the power provided by the Special Attack EVs is usually appreciated more. Natural Cure is Shaymin's only ability, but it is useful because it lets Shaymin switch in without fearing Toxic poison, Scald burns, nor any other status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Shaymin into Pokemon that it checks, such as Milotic and Gigalith, so you can have it set up a substitute or use Leech Seed to wear down the foe. Also use Leech Seed in order to keep Shaymin healthy throughout the match. Once Shaymin uses Leech Seed against a Pokemon, it is a good idea to repeatedly use Substitute if applicable, as it can further wear down the foe and Leftovers recovery combined with Leech Seed recovery typically heals nearly all of the damage Shaymin inflicts on itself using Substitute. Similarly, if Shaymin is using Protect, use Protect as much as you can to heal HP with Leech Seed and Leftovers. However, don't use it if you predict the foe to set up, as doing so can be a costly play. Because Leech Seed is annoying for many Pokemon, some will commonly switch out, especially those that cannot 2HKO Shaymin. As a result, going for Leech Seed again when predicting a switch can be utilized to further pressure the opponent. If Shaymin has to break through bulkier Pokemon, one can repeatedly use Seed Flare to fish for Special Defense drops, at which point Shaymin will likely be able to 2HKO them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The point of this set is to wear down typical checks to Shaymin, so Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Dragalge and Roserade is very helpful. Pokemon that have similar checks as Shaymin, such as Golisopod, Flygon, Yanmega, and Gardevoir, also make for great partners. Additionally, Shaymin is a great check to Water- and Ground-types, so Pokemon that do not have a good matchup against these types such as Toxicroak, Salazzle, Tyrantrum, and Flygon benefit from Shaymin being a partner. Slow setup sweepers like Snorlax benefit from having Shaymin to help wear down their checks and  revenge kill wallbreakers with average Speed.</p>"

      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebrate in conjunction with Normalium Z lets Shaymin boost all its stats by one stage. Seed Flare is Shaymin's strongest STAB move and can potentially break past checks like Mandibuzz with Special Defense drops. Air Slash hits Grass-types like Virizion and Roserade and covers targets like Noivern that Shaymin struggles with otherwise. Earth Power handles Steel-types like Registeel and Fire-types like Ninetales. Synthesis and Hidden Power Fire can be used to let Shaymin act as a consistent check to Water-types like Milotic while still  covering targets like Virizion and Registeel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z with Celebrate lets Shaymin boost all of its stats by a single stage. 252 Special Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs maximize Shaymin's potential to sweep teams. A Timid nature lets Shaymin outpace Choice Scarf users like Roserade after using Z-Celebrate. Natural Cure lets Shaymin absorb status conditions such as paralysis, which is especially useful when running Synthesis.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wait until late-game to set up, as earlier in the game, there will likely be roadblocks like Registeel that Shaymin struggles with. In a similar sense, make sure that any potential checks are adequately chipped so that Shaymin will be able to KO them. For example, wear down Pokemon like Noivern so that Shaymin doesn't have to worry about them halting its sweep. Capitalize on Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Band Zygarde-10% locked into Thousand Arrows and Choice Scarf Drapion locked into Knock Off to give Shaymin easy setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Golem is a great partner, being able to remove Steel-types, mainly Bronzong and Registeel, so that Shaymin has an easier time sweeping. Spikes setters like Golisopod and Forretress can chip down potential checks such as Registeel, giving Shaymin an easier time at sweeping late-game. Pursuit trappers like Sneasel and Drapion are excellent partners, being able to trap and remove problematic Pokemon like Bronzong. Pokemon that have similar checks as Shaymin can work as good teammates. For example, Choice Specs Yanmega can work with it to wear down checks like Registeel. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is great at crippling walls with Trick as well. Pokemon that can take advantage of some of Shaymin's checks are great teammates. Examples are Substitute Mismagius for Registeel and Mega Ampharos for Mandibuzz.</p>"

  "Emboar": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite Emboar's access to Reckless and high Attack stat, it finds itself outclassed by numerous other Fighting- and Fire-type wallbreakers in RU, such as Bewear, Toxicroak, Medicham, and Arcanine. Emboar's base 65 Speed stat and decent STAB combination mean it is able to outspeed and beat common Fighting- and Fire-type checks like Cresselia, Florges, Mega Ampharos, Adamant Tyrantrum, Rhyperior, and Milotic. It still falls short of prominent Pokemon such as Barbaracle, Tyrantrum, and Gardevoir, though. While Reckless is a great offensive ability, it comes with the downside of wearing down Emboar extremely quickly. Coupled with its relatively low Speed, lackluster bulk, and vulnerability to entry hazards, this often means Emboar won't last long in drawn-out battles against bulkier teams, unlike other wallbreakers with recovery and better defensive presences like Bewear and Toxicroak. Emboar's secondary STAB attack in Superpower also has a drawback in lowering its Attack and Defense stats; the opponent can take advantage of this to force Emboar out or set up on it, which further compounds its vulnerability to entry hazards. Despite its decent defensive typing, it offers very little defensive presence compared to Bewear, Toxicroak, or Arcanine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With an Expert Belt, Emboar is able to hit super effective targets such as Bronzong and Porygon2 hard, and it comes with the benefit of not locking Emboar into a single move. This can be very beneficial if the opponent has several Pokemon that resist one of its moves, and the lack of a Choice item also lets Emboar use Sucker Punch more reliably. While a Choice Scarf set may seem decent, Emboar's low Speed stat doesn't allow it to revenge kill any notable setup sweeper, and it provides very little utility over other Choice Scarf users, such as Tyrantrum and Flygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Double switching and offensive plays limit Emboar from coming in as often. An experienced player will likely avoid bringing passive Pokemon in for long periods of time, as well as pivoting to Pokemon that can beat Emboar such as Gardevoir.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Since Emboar is easily weakened by recoil from Flare Blitz and Wild Charge, miscellaneous damage from entry hazards, weather, and status can severely limit its survivability.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Araquanid discourage Emboar from spamming Flare Blitz, forcing it into mind games to try predicting them switching in by using the much more easily exploitable Wild Charge and Superpower. However, Expert Belt and Bulk Up variants have a better matchup versus these Pokemon. Other Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, such as Qwilfish, and Noivern, also pressure Emboar significantly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Despite its Speed allowing it to reach an important benchmark, Emboar is still outpaced by several common threats such as Mega Blastoise, Gardevoir, and Toxicroak. Though Sucker Punch somewhat mitigates this issue, it is very reliant on prediction and can end up backfiring easily.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Reckless-boosted Wild Charge hits Flying- and Water-types like Noivern, Slowbro, Mega Blastoise, and Milotic, which would be able to wall Emboar otherwise. Earthquake, while hitting very little on its own that Emboar's other coverage moves cannot, is a safer move to use than Superpower because it doesn't lower Emboar's Attack and Defense, and it still hits Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Dragalge, Diancie, Rhyperior, and Salazzle. It must be noted that the difference in damage between Earthquake and Superpower is very noticeable, and most of the Pokemon listed already dislike switching into Emboar anyway. Sucker Punch can provide priority, which can be used to revenge kill frail foes such as Salazzle and Swellow. However, it can be quite unreliable because being locked into the move is very easily exploitable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment lets Emboar hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Emboar to outspeed the crowded 242 Speed benchmark, which includes Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Adamant Tyrantrum, Bewear, and Florges. Choice Band makes Emboar hit extremely hard, though keep in mind this will make it wear itself down even further, and other Pokemon can take advantage of it when it is Choice locked. For example, Barbaracle can use it as setup fodder on a predicted Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is the move Emboar should use most often due to its tremendous power. However, if the opponent has several Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Milotic and Tyrantrum, try to predict the opponent switching into them by hitting them with the appropriate coverage move. Emboar's decent defensive typing lets it check several Pokemon such as Escavalier, Mega Abomasnow, and Sneasel in a pinch. However, due to its lackluster bulk and its tendency to quickly accumulate recoil damage, it is a very shaky check to them in the long run. Likewise, due to its dependency on its item to wallbreak, it isn't the greatest Knock Off switch-in despite its resistance to Dark. This can make building with Emboar somewhat awkward. Only use Sucker Punch sparingly, and only use it when you're certain the target will attack; opponents can easily take advantage of an Emboar that is locked into Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast sweepers such as Virizion and Dragon Dance Zygarde-10% appreciate Emboar's ability to break walls such as Cresselia, Mandibuzz, and Uxie. Emboar needs reliable entry hazard removal from the likes of Sigilyph and Mandibuzz to function properly due to the huge amounts of recoil it tends to accumulate. Conversely, it appreciates hazards support of its own to wear down its common switch-ins such as Milotic, Alolan Marowak, and Slowbro. Psychic-types such as Gardevoir and Espeon appreciate Emboar's ability to check and pressure Dark- and Bug-types, and they can wear down checks to Emboar like Dragalge and Salazzle in return. Additionally, Gardevoir can utilize Healing Wish to heal Emboar if it has taken too much damage, and Espeon is able to bounce back entry hazards using Magic Bounce to further support it. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch user such as Mega Ampharos or Uxie allows Emboar to enter the field safely. Emboar appreciates Pursuit users such as Drapion, Sneasel, Escavalier, and Aerodactyl that can trap Pokemon like Slowbro and Noivern that prevent it from spamming its STAB attacks.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland under sand is one of the scariest Pokemon that offensive teams can face. With an Adamant nature and a Choice Band, it hits extremely hard, especially with its STAB Return. It has the coverage to hit Pokemon that resist Return, such as Superpower and Crunch, making it very difficult to wall. It also has access to Pursuit, allowing it to trap and revenge kill frailer offensive Pokemon. However, Stoutland needs sand up to function effectively at all, giving it a mandatory partner in Gigalith. It is extremely prediction reliant; if the opponent predicts correctly by switching in Rock-, Steel-, or Ghost-types, Stoutland can be forced out, which loses momentum for the player. Finally, while Stoutland is extremely powerful, it fails to OHKO many offensive threats such as Mega Blastoise and Necrozma.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Silk Scarf and Life Orb are options in order to ease the need to predict with Stoutland, but the power drop is noticable. Play Rough is an option to hit Fighting- and Dark-types such as Passimian and Mandibuzz harder, but all of them take a lot of damage from Return anyway. Wild Charge is an option to surprise bulky Water-types such as Milotic, but generally Stoutland's other coverage moves hit more Pokemon. Giga Impact with a Normalium Z can muscle past some of Stoutland's checks while also lessening the need to predict, but the power drop and loss of coverage is typically worse than just running Choice Band. Fire Fang hits Escavalier and Forretress the hardest, but the former takes a lot from Superpower, and the coverage they privide is limited otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Metagross, Diancie, Mismagius, Rhyperior, Registeel, Bronzong, and Marowak-Alola are immune to or resist Stoutland's main STAB move, preventing Stoutland from spamming it. However, they typically fear coverage such as Superpower or Crunch. Even more offensive Pokemon such as Escavalier prevent this and force the player to predict a switch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While Stoutland is very powerful, certain physically bulky walls such as Mandibuzz, Slowbro, and Cresselia can barely avoid the 2HKO from Stoutland's moves, recover their HP, and hit Stoutland with their STAB attacks or set up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Lack of Sand</strong>: Stoutland needs sand up to effectively revenge kill opposing Pokemon or clean, so opposing weather setters such as Ninetales, Mega Abomasnow, and Vanilluxe render Stoutland nearly useless, although they can't switch in. Also, KOing Gigalith limits Stoutland's usefulness for the rest of the battle, so pressuring or luring it help check Stoutland.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: If Stoutland is worn down, priority from Pokemon such as Honchkrow and Toxicroak can KO it because they do not care about Sand Rush. However, none of these Pokemon can KO Stoutland if it is healthy.</p> <p><strong>Gardevoir</strong>: Gardevoir can Trace Sand Rush, KO Stoutland if it is weakened, and threaten the opposing team with its STAB attacks. However, it cannot switch in or KO Stoutland if it is at full health.</p>",

      "Sand Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Stoutland's main STAB move, hitting anything that is not a Rock-, Steel-, or Ghost-type hard. Superpower hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Return does not deal much damage to. Pursuit allows Stoutland to revenge kill frailer, more offensive Pokemon under sand, such as Swellow, Salazzle, and Espeon. Crunch hits targets that Return and Superpower cannot break through, such as Metagross and Mismagius, harder than Pursuit. Facade allows Stoutland to be threatening even when it is burned, which would otherwise cripple it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread, an Adamant nature, and a Choice Band maximize Stoutland's damage output while allowing it to outspeed nearly everything in RU under sand. A Jolly nature is unnecessary because Stoutland is only outsped by very fast and niche Choice Scarf users such as Noivern and Salazzle under sand. Sand Rush is the main reason to use Stoutland, as it allows it to revenge kill more offensive Pokemon and clean when sand is up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stoutland can be used to both revenge kill opposing Pokemon and clean up, as with Sand Rush activated, it outspeeds everything in the tier unboosted. It can easily clean up once its checks, mainly Normal-resistant Pokemon, are worn down. Stoutland is very prediction reliant; even though Return is extremely powerful, Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types can switch into it at least once, if not more. As a result, go for Superpower or Crunch if predicting one of these Pokemon to switch in in order to severely weaken them. Use Pursuit to trap and revenge kill offensive Pokemon that Stoutland threatens, such as Swellow and Salazzle. Stoutland needs sand up in order effectively revenge kill; as a result, use sand turns wisely. Keep Gigalith healthy so it can set sand for Stoutland throughout the match, and try to switch into Stoutland safely if sand is up every chance you get.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gigalith is a mandatory partner for Stoutland; its ability, Sand Stream, activates Stoutland's ability and allows it to effectively revenge kill and clean. Gigalith also provides Stealth Rock for Stoutland, which it appreciates in order to wear down its checks. While Gigalith provides Stealth Rock for Stoutland, it also appreciates Spikes from Forretress and Roserade to further weaken its checks. Other Pursuit users, particularly ones that threaten Ghost-types such as Honchkrow and Sneasel, are good partners for Stoutland, as Ghost-types prevent Stoutland from spamming its STAB move. Furthermore, partners that threaten Rock- and Steel-types such as Bewear, Pangoro, and Metagross make for decent partners, as Stoutland fails to 2HKO many Rock- and Steel-types with Return. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mandibuzz, Swellow, and Raikou make for decent partners, as they give Stoutland free switches. Because Gigalith and Stoutland are both weak to Fighting-types, Pokemon that can deal with them such as Nidoqueen, Mandibuzz, Florges, and Gardevoir make good teammates.</p>"

  "Gigalith": {
    "overview": "<p>Gigalith's access to Sand Stream, which boosts its Special Defense by 50%, makes it an extremely durable Pokemon with its base 85 / 130 / 80 bulk. Sand Stream is the biggest factor in making Gigalith a good Pokemon, as it makes Stoutland an incredible threat, removes sun, hinders moves such as Synthesis and Moonlight, and provides chip damage that can be an annoyance to the opponent (but to the user as well). Gigalith's movepool is also diverse enough with access to moves such as Stealth Rock, making it one of the most effective users of it, along with Stone Edge, Rock Blast, and Earthquake. In addition, with its Rock typing and incredible defenses, Gigalith makes for a good check against a number of threats such as Swellow, Salazzle, Dragalge, Goodra, and Ninetales. All that said, its typing also gives it a weakness to the common Water- and Ground-types in the tier such as Slowbro, Milotic, Rhyperior, and Flygon. Additionally, Gigalith is pitifully slow, has no recovery outside of Leftovers, and has to compete with other Rock-types in the tier, including Rhyperior, which can be more hard hitting, and Diancie, which has more utility with its Fairy typing and access to Heal Bell.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gigalith can run an offensive Choice Band set, but it is mostly outclassed in that role by Rhyperior and Tyrantrum. A set consisting of Curse alongside Rest, Stone Edge or Rock Blast, and Sleep Talk can be utilized, but a Curse set can be pulled off better by the likes of Snorlax. Explosion with possibly a Normal Gem is an option that can be used to retain momentum while going out with a bang to bring another Pokemon in safely, but it's a waste of Gigalith's bulk on balance teams and its ability to check multiple threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Donphan, Flygon, and Rhyperior have super effective STAB moves that can often 2HKO Gigalith easily. Nidoqueen can also 2HKO with Earth Power but has to be afraid of Gigalith's own Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Milotic, Slowbro, Slowking, and Mega Blastoise can all tank Gigalith's hits and fire off super effective Scalds to weaken it. Despite that, they are all susceptible to Toxic and don't like getting badly poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Virizion can easily switch in and exploit Gigalith's weaknesses. Shaymin, Tsareena, and Roserade can hurt Gigalith, but it can easily survive a hit or two and hit them back hard.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Bronzong doesn't care about Toxic while easily being able to switch into and set up Stealth Rock on Gigalith and wear it down with Toxic. It must be wary of rare Throat Chop vairants, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Escavalier, Metagross, and Klinklang are all immune to Toxic and can threaten Gigalith with super effective STAB moves, but they can take a lot of damage from Gigalith's Rock-type STAB or Earthquake. Metagross can mitigate this with a Shuca Berry, while Klinklang can avoid it altogether with Magnet Rise.</p>",

Stone Edge provides the necessary STAB move of choice, although Rock Blast is another option to consider that is more accurate and has more PP while being weaker most of the time, making it miss out on crucial 2HKOs that Stone Edge would get, with the biggest example being Shaymin. Earthquake provides good coverage and hits Pokemon that would otherwise check Gigalith, such as Nidoqueen. Toxic is used in the final slot to cripple bulky switch-ins such as Slowbro and Donphan. Throat Chop is an option to heavily damage Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread is straightforward with all points invested into HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature to make Gigalith able to check the Pokemon that it needs to. However, Impish with the same EV spread can be used to make Gigalith take hits from the likes of Honchkrow and Drapion a lot better while giving up some Special Defense. Leftovers is Gigalith's only form of recovery, so it needs it. Despite this, Smooth Rock is an option for sand-oriented teams, and it can make Stoutland's life easier by prolonging sand turns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Gigalith to set up Stealth Rock early in the game, and then try to keep it alive to potentially check Pokemon like Swellow and Salazzle later. If the opponent has certain entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise and Donphan, attempt to weaken them with attacks or Toxic before prioritizing Stealth Rock. Many threatening Pokemon such as Metagross, Virizion, Rhyperior, and Bewear may use Gigalith as a chance to come in freely on Stealth Rock or a Rock-type move, so either wearing them down with Earthquake and Toxic or switching out into a better matchup can prevent them from consistently getting chances to threaten Gigalith’s team. Toxic is also generally useful for crippling bulky switch-ins such as Slowbro and Palossand. Additionally, if you have Stoutland, then consider keeping Gigalith to set up sand in preparation for Stoutland's sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stoutland is the most obvious choice for a partner, as it greatly benefits from sand doubling its Speed. Grass-types in general have good synergy with Gigalith, making Pokemon like Shaymin, Roserade, and Virizion good partners. Roserade can also set up Spikes. Keep in mind, however, that sand being present will hinder Synthesis's healing ability.  Additionally, bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Milotic, and Mantine make for good teammates despite the shared Grass weakness for their ability to switch into and check Pokemon such as Donphan, Flygon, and Metagross. Sigilyph makes for a decent partner also, since it has Magic Guard, which avoids the chip damage from sand, while offering Defog support and protection against opposing Fighting- and Ground-types such as Pangoro, Machamp, Virizion, and the aforementioned Flygon and Donphan.</p>"

Seismitoad's great movepool gives it the option to run great utility moves like Knock Off, Refresh, and Protect. However, a lack of reliable recovery leaves Seismitoad susceptible to chip damage, meaning that it'll struggle heavily to check offensive Pokemon as the game progresses. Seismitoad's somewhat mediocre bulk and lack of recovery mean that it'll likely be dropped in favor of better Water-types like Slowbro and Mantine that have those those traits and other options like greater coverage for the former and Defog for the latter.

Stone Edge can be utilized to hit Flying-types such as Noivern, Mantine, and Mandibuzz, as well as Bug-types like Golisopod and Ribombee.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: When Sawk's Sturdy ability isn't active, its low bulk makes it susceptible to faster Pokemon including Virizion, Noivern, Ribombee, and Roserade.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Noivern, Mantine, and Yanmega can easily switch in on Close Combat or All-Out Pummeling and take Sawk out with ease with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: While none of them appreciate switching in on a Knock Off, Pokemon such as Metagross, Slowbro, and Sigilyph can take most other hits Sawk can dish out and either KO it or wall it outright in the case of Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes can easily whittle Sawk down and break its Sturdy.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Sawk's primary STAB move and is useful for both taking down numerous Steel- and Rock-types in the tier and for inflicting heavy damage when used as All-Out Pummeling. Knock Off is good for getting rid of items from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and is also used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types like Metagross, Bronzong, and Mismagius. Taunt cripples defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Bronzong, and Poison Jab rounds off the set, hitting Fairy-types like Gardevoir and Florges super effectively. Earthquake can be used to hit Poison-type Pokemon that otherwise resist Sawk's STAB move such as Toxicroak, Dragalge, and Salazzle, as well as to hit Fire-types such as Alolan Marowak and Arcanine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy is the ability of choice due to its utility against setup sweepers like Barbaracle and Nasty Plot Ninetales. A Jolly nature lets Sawk outspeed Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Goodra and, more importantly, Mega Blastoise. Fightinium Z turns Close Combat into an extremely powerful All-Out Pummeling, capable of KOing Mega Blastoise after Stealth Rock the majority of the time, while also making Sawk rely less on prediction due to the lack of Choice-locking.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's usually best not to directly switch Sawk in due to its frailty and the risk of breaking its Sturdy. It is especially not recommended to switch Sawk in when there are entry hazards or status users on the field or when a hail or sand setter such as Gigalith or Mega Abomasnow is present. Sawk's Sturdy ability can be utilized to safely get a hit in on any Pokemon, even Pokemon that hit it super effectively. Taunt is most effectively used when a defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz or Bronzong is on the field, preventing them from using moves like Toxic, Defog, or Stealth Rock in the case of the latter. Finally, All-Out Pummeling should be utilized when you want to unleash a powerful STAB attack against the opponent, but note that using it when a Pokemon that resists it is on the field is not recommended.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sawk fits wells on more offensive teams due to its frailty and lack of defensive presence. Sawk's Sturdy ability can most commonly be broken with entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes. To combat this, hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Sigilyph, and Tsareena are a must. Pokemon such as Raikou, Mega Ampharos, and Noivern can easily pivot Sawk into play, giving it free turns to break down teams and keep Sturdy intact. Since Flying-types are a thorn in Sawk's side, checks to these Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Barbaracle, and Raikou can be useful partners.</p>"

  "Sigilyph": {
    "overview": "<p>Sigilyph can function as an offensive Defogger that can threaten Nidoqueen, Roserade, Metagross, and Registeel with its combination of Psychic and Heat Wave or a powerful wallbreaker with Calm Mind. Magic Guard prevents damage from Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and status, allowing Sigilyph to avoid chip damage and use Defog or set up more consistently. However, Sigilyph is largely outclassed by other hazard control options such as Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, and Donphan, which can check a lot of threats due to their superior bulk or offer better offensive presence. Because Sigilyph's Speed stat is only decent for an offensive Pokemon, it will struggle to revenge kill faster threats such as Shaymin, Virizion, and Salazzle. Bad defensive typing and bulk also leave it weak to common threats like Tyrantrum and susceptible to coverage moves found on Pokemon like Donphan, Virizion, and Mega Blastoise. Vulnerability to Pursuit from Pokémon like Drapion is another factor that makes it more unreliable. The prevalence of defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Milotic, and Porygon2 is a big problem, since Sigilyph can't beat them reliably with its STAB moves if not running Calm Mind.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other coverage options like Ice Beam, Flash Cannon, and Energy Ball can be used to beat Pokemon like Flygon, Mandibuzz, Diancie, and Rhyperior but are hard to fit on standard sets because Sigilyph can't usually afford to drop its moves. A Calm Mind + 3 attacks set can be used to punch holes in defensive cores but lacks the longevity given by Roost. Icium Z and Ice Beam can be used on such a set as a way to lure Mandibuzz effectively. A Focus Sash + Thunder Wave or Tailwind set can be used as an emergency button to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Salazzle and Virizion, and Sigilyph is a perfect Pokemon for this role, since Magic Guard ensures it will always take a hit. Flame Orb + Psycho Shift can be used to cripple threats like Bewear and Honchkrow and spread burns on defensive Pokemon such as Bronzong and Registeel. However, this set will underwhelm in initial power due to the lack of Life Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mandibuzz</strong>: Mandibuzz is a full stop to Sigilyph, since it is immune to Psychic, takes little damage from Air Slash and Heat Wave, easily takes out Sigilyph with Foul Play or Knock Off, and can outlast Sigilyph by using Roost properly.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Diancie, Gigalith, Tyrantrum, and Rhyperior can take most of Sigilyph's moves when it lacks Flash Cannon or Energy Ball and retaliate with powerful STAB attacks or set entry hazards to pressure the opposing team. Lycanroc-D can set up Swords Dance on it and proceed to break through its partners with Splintered Stormshards, but it has to be careful of Focus Sash variants.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Drapion is immune to Psychic and can threaten Sigilyph with a powerful Knock Off or Pursuit to remove it from the match. Umbreon can take virtually anything from Sigilyph and use Wish to heal its teammates or proceed to beat Sigilyph with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Tyrantrum and Flygon can scare Sigilyph out with Head Smash or Outrage. Other Pokemon like Virizion, Mismagius, Zygarde-10%, and Salazzle can take it out with their STAB attacks or Z-Moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Psychic lets Sigilyph hit entry hazard setters like Nidoqueen and Roserade and OHKO Toxicroak and Bewear. Heat Wave is the preferred coverage move to hit Steel-types like Bronzong, Metagross, and Escavalier, which would otherwise wall Sigilyph completely. Roost keeps Sigilyph healthy during the match with proper prediction and is important for beating hazard setters like Registeel. Air Slash is a secondary STAB option to OHKO Virizion, however, not running Roost means you cannot Defog on Registeel. Defog is the main niche of the set, allowing Sigilyph to support teammates that are weak to Stealth Rock like Yanmega and Golisopod.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Sigilyph able to outspeed the likes of Roserade and Toxicroak and hit as hard as it can. Life Orb is mandatory to boost Sigilyph's power and make it able to OHKO defensive variants of Escavalier with Heat Wave. Magic Guard is also necessary to protect it from Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and status damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize slow pivots like Mega Ampharos, Xatu, and Mandibuzz to bring Sigilyph in safely. Roost is best used when forcing switches from slower Pokemon like Bewear and Machamp to heal so Sigilyph can find better opportunities to attack or use Defog later in the match. Utilize Magic Guard to switch into passive Pokemon like Milotic and Cresselia and remove entry hazards, especially if running Roost. When Sigilyph is on field, it’s usually good to use an appropriate coverage move, but you have to be attentive in the presence of Pokemon like Drapion and Sneasel, which can switch in on Psychic and Pursuit trap it. If the opposing team lacks a Pursuit trapper, Sigilyph can enter much more aggressively, especially against bulky builds that rely on status and hazard damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that beat Mandibuzz like Tyrantrum, Mega Abomasnow, and Rhyperior are very appreciated, since they can remove Sigilyph's most prevalent counter and provide offensive presence or hazard support. Choice Specs Yanmega is another very good partner, since it can pressure a lot of Sigilyph's checks such as Cresselia, Mandibuzz, and Bronzong with its strong Bug Buzz, open the way for Sigilyph to spam Psychic and Air Slash more freely, and circumvent its big Stealth Rock weakness with Sigilyph's Defog. Virizion can help by taking out Pokemon like Milotic and Porygon2, while Sigilyph can beat the likes of Nidoqueen and Dragalge. Fire-types such as Arcanine, Ninetales, and Salazzle appreciate Sigilyph's ability to keep the field clean with Defog.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is the best STAB option to threaten Fighting- and Poison-types immediately. Heat Wave handles Pokemon that resist Psychic such as Bronzong, Escavalier, and Registeel. Roost is essential on this set to recover HP and set up reliably. Calm Mind boosts Sigilyph's Special Attack and Special Defense to help it break through defensive cores and take special hits from Pokemon like Necrozma and Salazzle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is mandatory for making Sigilyph as strong and fast as possible. Life Orb is the preferable item for punching holes along with Calm Mind boosts. Magic Guard protects Sigilyph from passive damage, which is amazing for a setup sweeper.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With this set, Sigilyph can get opportunities to set up against Pokemon like Dragalge and Roserade after the Special Attack drop from their Draco Meteor and Leaf Storm as well as against Choice-locked Pokemon like Bewear and Gardevoir when they are locked into resisted moves. It also can get in against passive threats like Milotic, Florges, and Bronzong without Gyro Ball to set up and hit hard after some Calm Mind boosts. Roost must be used whenever it gets chipped down to minimize the chance of getting KOed by a critical hit after the boosts from Calm Mind. Try scouting for moves that can potentially stop Sigilyph from using Calm Mind comfortably, like Hidden Power Ice from Shaymin and Thunder Wave from Porygon2 and Cresselia. It's also good to reveal Calm Mind only when it's absolutely necessary, and this set must be careful about setting up when switch-ins still exist, especially Pursuit trappers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyrantrum, Bewear, and Rhyperior are great partners for pressuring Pokemon that aren't threatened by Sigilyph after boosts, like Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Drapion. Virizion and Espeon can form Calm Mind cores with Sigilyph to bypass each other's checks due to the use of Z-Moves like Bloom Doom, All-Out Pummeling, and Gigavolt Havoc. Pokemon that are able to take on Pursuit trappers like Drapion and Sneasel, including Rhyperior, Barbaracle and Escavalier, are a must. Sigilyph also likes the pivoting support of Flygon, Mandibuzz, and Mega Ampharos. Speed control such as Thunder Wave from Porygon2 and Sticky Web from Araquanid allows Sigilyph to outpace threats like Virizion and Salazzle.</p>"

Unfortunately, that's where the positive traits end with Cofagrigus. It is easily shut down by Taunt users such as Mandibuzz because of its low Speed, it is heavily worn down by status conditions and strong attacks, it has a low HP stat that does not complement its defenses, it lacks recovery besides the unreliable Pain Split, and it is overall just extremely passive. Other Pokemon such as Necrozma, Slowbro, and Cresselia are stronger options to deter Fighting-types thanks to their access to reliable recovery, better stats all around, way less passive field presence, and stronger utility options outside of checking Fighting-types.</p>",

  "Garbodor": {
    "overview": "<p>Garbodor fills a small niche as a physically defensive Spikes setter that can fit on certain entry hazard-stacking teams, as its pure Poison typing and respectable defensive stats give Garbodor many points of entry against enemy Fighting-, Fairy-, and Steel-types such as Virizion, Machamp, Toxicroak, Florges, and Registeel, which it can serve as a check to while laying down Spikes. Its ability in Aftermath ensures substantial chip damage on many of these Pokemon as Garbodor faints. Its access to a 100% accurate Toxic makes it an annoyance for many potential entry hazard removers like Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, and even Donphan to switch into, allowing it to keep Spikes on the field in longer battles. However, Garbodor has a nasty weakness to Psychic-types such as Necrozma and Slowbro. In addition to this, Garbodor's Poison typing does it no favors against RU's multitude of specially attacking Poison-types such as Salazzle, Nidoqueen, and Dragalge, which can force it out thanks to their strong attacks. Garbodor hates taking residual damage of any sort, as between a lack of Black Sludge recovery and Pain Split's unreliability, Garbodor can be hard-pressed to keep itself healthy. Compounding this, it's also vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards besides Toxic Spikes, dislikes Scald burns, and detests having its Rocky Helmet removed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stomping Tantrum can be used over Pain Split to pressure grounded Poison-types, but Garbodor will sorely miss the recovery Pain Split provides. Toxic Spikes can be used over Pain Split, but the synergy between Toxic and normal Spikes means Pain Split is often not worth giving up. Moreover, many of the tier's Poison-types, like Salazzle and Nidoqueen, can already switch into Garbodor easily. Black Sludge can be used as the held item, but Garbodor loses out on its utility of chipping away at contact attackers, making this option inferior to Rocky Helmet.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Necrozma, Espeon, and Sigilyph can all threaten big damage or a KO on Garbodor with their super effective STAB moves. Espeon and Xatu, in particular, can bounce back Garbodor's Spikes and do not fear Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Attacks</strong>: Many physical attackers carry Ground-type attacks and resist Gunk Shot, such as Donphan, Metagross, Rhyperior, and Zygarde-10%, and can force Garbodor out. Some Fighting-types that Garbodor is supposed to check, like Passimian and Hariyama, can surprise it by carrying Earthquake as well.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Certain Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Donphan and Golbat care very little about anything Garbodor can do to them, can remove its Spikes, and, in Donphan's case, can threaten Garbodor with Earthquake. Mandibuzz takes no damage from Spikes and can use Taunt on Garbodor, use Defog to remove its Spikes, and then switch to a Ground-type teammate to take its Gunk Shot. Sigilyph fears Gunk Shot, but it threatens Garbodor with a powerful Psychic and can use Defog to remove its Spikes while not fearing Toxic at all thanks to Magic Guard.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Garbodor hates having to take additional damage, as it has issues keeping itself healthy as is. Entry hazard damage, Scald burns, and attacks after its Rocky Helmet has been removed are all detrimental to its longevity.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot serves as Garbodor's main STAB move, dealing decent damage to neutral targets and having a nice chance to poison them. Toxic can be used to chip away at bulky walls that do not mind Gunk Shot or are immune to Spikes as they switch in, such as Cresselia and Mandibuzz. Garbodor is an effective user of Spikes due to its good bulk and typing, and Toxic allows it to have a good matchup against many common forms of entry hazard removal such as Mandibuzz and Mega Blastoise. Pain Split allows Garbodor to recover HP against bulky Steel-types that do not mind Toxic or Gunk Shot, such as Registeel and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment alongside an Impish nature is used to maximize Garbodor's physical bulk, enabling it to reliably take on certain physical attackers such as Virizion, Passimian, and Golisopod and set Spikes against them. Rocky Helmet can be used to further punish these contact attackers and weaken them into range of being KOed by one of Garbodor's teammates. Aftermath is chosen as Garbodor's ability to further bolster its matchup against contact attackers, threatening to take away 25% of their maximum HP if they KO Garbodor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garbodor can use its many good matchups to lay Spikes against the opposing team, coming in on attacks it resists like Fighting- and Grass-type ones. Opposing Fighting-types make reliable points of entry for Garbodor, as foes like Virizion and Machamp often struggle to damage it and fear Gunk Shot damage and poison. Using Toxic on opposing entry hazard removers such as Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, and Donphan puts a lot of pressure on them, making them unable to consistently remove Garbodor's Spikes, as Mandibuzz struggles to fit Taunt alongside Defog. Garbodor should not stay in on physical attackers that carry Earthquake such as Flygon and Donphan, which can remove its Spikes as well as threaten a clean 2HKO. Keep Garbodor away from special attackers, namely Psychic-types like Necrozma and Espeon, as they can easily overpower and force it out with their strong STAB attacks. Espeon and Xatu give Garbodor an especially big headache, as they aren't scared of Toxic and can bounce back Garbodor's Spikes with Magic Bounce, but they need to be wary of taking Gunk Shot on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams in need of some cushion against Fighting-types. Teammates such as Calm Mind Necrozma and Choice Band Metagross appreciate entry hazard support, which helps them to break through foes. Garbodor's Toxic can also assist in breaking down sturdy walls like Mandibuzz and Slowbro, further enabling these wallbreakers to function. Bronzong works very well with Garbodor, being able to cover Garbodor's Ground-type weakness as well as set up Stealth Rock, further assisting its team's wallbreaking capability. Additionally, Bronzong provides a check to Poison-types, most notably Nidoqueen. Due to the nature of entry hazard-stacking teams, Rapid Spin users are preferred over Defog users to remove entry hazards from Garbodor's side of the field. Mega Blastoise fulfills this role well, being able to threaten Psychic-types that scare Garbodor off with its powerful Dark Pulse. Wallbreakers that appreciate Fighting-types being kept in check by Garbodor, such as Rhyperior and Tyrantrum, make for good teammates. Teammates that can handle Psychic-types like Honchkrow, Escavalier, and Golisopod also work well alongside Garbodor, and they appreciate its Spikes support for their own wallbreaking purposes. Flygon makes for a good partner as well, as it's able to switch in on Nidoqueen sets that lack Ice Beam as well as draw in Pokemon that Garbodor can set Spikes against like Florges, Golisopod, and Mandibuzz. Pursuit users such as Metagross and Drapion can work well to alleviate pressure from enemy Psychic-types, namely Bronzong and Sigilyph.</p>"

  "Vanilluxe": {
    "overview": "<p>Snow Warning allows Vanilluxe to power off extremely powerful Blizzards, which can quickly dismantle teams lacking a sturdy Steel-type such as Registeel. A decent Speed tier puts it above many metagame threats, particularly Mega Blastoise, as well as other Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Tyrantrum. Blizzard + Freeze-Dry + Hidden Power Fire allows Vanilluxe to hit the majority of the tier for at least neutral damage, only missing out on Fire-types. It also has utility in Taunt that lets it prevent walls like Bronzong from setting up entry hazards and priority in the form of Ice Shard that lets it remove Pokemon like Noivern more easily. Despite this, Vanilluxe fails to make headway against the plethora of teams running sturdy Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong. Even against bulky offense, Vanilluxe will struggle to make immediate progress, as it'll have to worry about getting through other Steel-types like Metagross, and its mediocre defenses combined with an abysmal defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to faster bulky offense staples such as Virizion and Salazzle. Vanilluxe's underwhelming Special Attack stat means that all of its attacks bar Blizzard will be lacking. Vanilluxe is also worn down quickly by residual damage, especially Stealth Rock due to its typing, and it struggles to switch into weak attacks because of its mediocre bulk and bad defensive typing.</p>",

  "Escavalier": {
    "overview": "<p>Escavalier is a wallbreaker that is almost impossible to switch into thanks to its amazing Attack stat and powerful STAB moves that allow it to beat Pokemon like Shaymin, Cresselia, and Florges. Its access to Pursuit also allows it to trap faster Pokemon like Metagross, Gardevoir, and Roserade lacking Hidden Power Fire. Escavalier can find multiple opportunities to switch into Pokemon like Gardevoir, Mega Sceptile, and Espeon because of its good defensive typing and respectable bulk. Unfortunately, Escavalier's poor Speed leaves it outpaced by the majority of the tier, which makes it easy to revenge kill. This is further exacerbated by Escavalier's 4x weakness to Fire-type moves, meaning that Pokemon such as Salazzle, Arcanine, and Ninetales and Pokemon with Fire-type coverage like Necrozma, Nidoqueen, and Venusaur will always force it out. Escavalier also lacks a reliable method of recovery outside of Leftovers, which, combined with its low Speed and its tendency to switch into resisted hits and entry hazards, makes it easy to wear down. Finally, Escavalier faces immense competition from Metagross as a bulky offensive Steel-type thanks to the latter's better Speed tier and greater versatility. It also competes with Golisopod as an offensive Bug-type thanks to Golisopod's access to First Impression and Spikes, giving it a much stronger offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternative EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe on the tank set allows Escavalier to hit much harder and outspeed uninvested base 30 Speed Pokemon like Slowbro and Snorlax. This, however, comes at the cost of Escavalier's bulk. A set utilizing Swords Dance / Megahorn / Rest / Sleep Talk can make Escavalier a dangerous late-game cleaner provided its checks are taken care of, but it requires too much support to function well. Toxic can catch bulky Water- and Flying-types off guard, but Escavalier's other utility options are usually better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Escavalier's very low Speed and 4x weakness to Fire mean that it is always forced out by Fire-types such as Salazzle, Ninetales, and Arcanine as well as Pokemon with Fire-type coverage like Necrozma, Nidoqueen, and Roserade. Keep in mind that none of these Pokemon want to directly switch into Escavalier's moves, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because of Escavalier's reliance on Leftovers for recovery, it is often worn down by constantly switching into entry hazards and weak attacks from Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Shaymin, and Mega Sceptile.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Registeel, Gastrodon, and Mantine that resist one or both of Escavalier's STAB moves can usually stop it.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect allows Escavalier to scout for moves from Choice item Pokemon and gives it a free turn of Leftovers recovery. Pursuit allows Escavalier to trap and chip down Pokemon such as Metagross, Mega Sceptile, and Shaymin. Knock Off, alternatively, can remove items from defensive Pokemon like Registeel, Bronzong, Porygon2, and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Escavalier to hit as hard as possible while avoiding the 2HKO from Nidoqueen's Earth Power, assuming Escavalier uses Protect once for Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Escavalier should use its bulk and defensive typing to pivot into Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Shaymin, and Mega Sceptile. Once in battle, it can begin spamming Megahorn, which is very powerful but risks missing, or Iron Head, which picks up KOs more safely and hits targets like Bewear, Mismagius, and Florges that can take Megahorn. Use Protect to scout for moves from Choice item Pokemon, especially Trick and Switcheroo from Gardevoir and Noivern, and give Escavalier a free turn of Leftovers recovery so it can continue pivoting into special attackers. Protect is also great for scouting for Fire-type coverage from the likes of Nidoqueen, Goodra, and Venusaur, and it allows Escavalier to take less damage from Z-Moves. Pursuit should be used to trap Bronzong and frail Pokemon that cannot really hurt Escavalier, like Shaymin and Gardevoir Choice locked into their respective STAB moves. Since Escavalier needs its Leftovers to regain its health, it needs to steer clear of Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo, and its teammates should make sure that entry hazards are cleared.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-type checks such as Zygarde-10%, Slowbro, and Hariyama are practically mandatory when running Escavalier. Fire-types such as Salazzle, Ninetales, and Arcanine pair well with Escavalier, as they can take on the bulky Steel-types that give Escavalier trouble. Pokemon such as Roserade, Salazzle, Passimian, and Necrozma appreciate Escavalier's ability to pivot into and Pursuit trap Psychic-types, giving them an easier time setting up and cleaning later. Necrozma and Roserade can further limit the ability of foes to switch into Escavalier by setting up entry hazards, while Passimian can provide U-turn support to allow Escavalier to come into battle safely. Teammates like Raikou, Shaymin, and Mega Sceptile can support Escavalier by taking care of bulky Water-types that it doesn't threaten. Knock Off sponges such as Z-Move Virizion and Acrobatics Passimian can also help Escavalier by allowing it to keep its Leftovers. Healing Wish and cleric support from the likes of Gardevoir, Shaymin, and Florges can help keep Escavalier healthy, since it lacks a reliable method of recovery.</p>"

Knock Off can deal solid damage to and remove items from defensive switch-ins like Registeel and Porygon2. Drill Run can catch Fire-type switch-ins like Salazzle and Ninetales off guard as well as deal a good amount of damage to Nidoqueen, Registeel, and Toxicroak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread, Escavalier outspeeds uninvested base 30 Speed Pokemon like Slowbro and Snorlax and still has a considerable amount of bulk to pivot into Pokemon like Shaymin and Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Escavalier can pivot into certain special attackers, it also greatly appreciates coming into battle with the help of a pivot, since this set lacks the passive recovery that Leftovers provides. Escavalier's STAB moves should be used the most on this set; Megahorn has absurd power, but Iron Head is safer due to its better accuracy. Use Pursuit to chip down foes that do not want to stay in against Escavalier such as Roserade lacking Hidden Power Fire, Shaymin locked into Seed Flare, and Bronzong. If running Knock Off, use it to cripple defensive switch-ins like Porygon2 and Registeel. Drill Run should be used to catch Pokemon like Metagross, Salazzle, and Toxicroak off guard as they pivot into Escavalier expecting a STAB move. Keep Escavalier as healthy as possible so it can continue to wallbreak.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A check to Fire-types, such as Zygarde-10%, Goodra, or Snorlax, is required when running Escavalier. Because it lacks Leftovers recovery, pivots such as Passimian, Flygon, and Noivern are good Pokemon to pair with Escavalier so it can enter the battle safely. Healing Wish users like Shaymin and Gardevoir are also recommended, since they can heal Escavalier if it has sustained prior damage. Setup sweepers like Raikou, Salazzle, and Virizion also appreciate Escavalier weakening the opposition so they have an easier time cleaning up late-game. Raikou and Stone Edge Virizion can also help Escavalier beat bulky Water- and Flying-types. Offensive Pokemon such as Roserade, Passimian, and Necrozma appreciate Escavalier's ability to Pursuit trap Psychic-types, giving them an easier time setting up and cleaning later. Roserade and Necrozma can also set entry hazards to limit the ability of foes to switch into Escavalier. Finally, entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, and Golbat can help Escavalier by letting it switch into battle more often.</p>"

It also sports a high Speed tier and a strong STAB combination of Thunder and Bug Buzz, allowing it to be an offensive threat to teams that rely on Grass-types to tank Electric-type moves. However, its mediocre base 97 Special Attack means that it is reliant on Life Orb for good damage output. Furthermore, Galvantula is frail and has a mediocre defensive typing, which means it struggles to switch in safely; this frailty also makes it difficult for Galvantula to keep Sticky Web up reliably. It is also beaten by some entry hazard removers that can outlast or KO it, particularly Florges and Donphan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash can be used for nearly guaranteed Sticky Web, but it comes at the cost of a huge loss in power. Energy Ball can hit Ground- and Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Donphan, Gigalith, Diancie, and Seismitoad, although Galvantula misses its ability to acquire momentum for its team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Type Advantage</strong>: Pokemon such as Donphan, Dragalge, and Nidoqueen resist or are immune to most of Galvantula's attacks and can threaten it out with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Offensive Pokemon with a good Special Defense stat such as Goodra and Assault Vest Hariyama are able to tank Galvantula's attacks and retaliate hard.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Espeon and Xatu can make Galvantula think twice about setting up Sticky Web due to their ability to bounce it back. However, they also must be wary of switching into a potential Bug Buzz or Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with Taunt that are faster than Galvantula such as Aerodactyl and Salazzle create mind games with Galvantula, since they risk taking huge damage from Galvantula's STAB moves, but at the same time, Galvantula risks being afflicted with Taunt, disallowing it to get up Sticky Web.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Registeel, Diancie, Snorlax, Florges, and most other specially defensive walls can tank Galvantula's attacks and wall it completely.

      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is used to slow down opposing grounded Pokemon when they switch in, giving Galvantula's team a huge advantage. Thunder is a powerful STAB attack that utilizes Compound Eyes to hit a good 91% accuracy. Bug Buzz is used to hit Grass-types and other Electric-types, which resist Thunder. Volt Switch lets Galvantula pivot on its counters such as Florges and Registeel into a teammate that can handle them, and can let it escape sticky situations so it can potentially set up its hazards again.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Galvantula a much-needed 1.3x boost to its attacks. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Galvantula to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Timid nature lets Galvantula outspeed Flygon and other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Compound Eyes gives Galvantula an accuracy boost to Thunder, making it a more reliable 91% accuracy attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In general, it is a good idea to lead with Galvantula unless the opponent has a Pokemon that can anti-lead against it, such as Nidoqueen or Florges. In this case, it is better to find an opportunity later in the game to set up Sticky Web. Galvantula should attempt to set up Sticky Web as soon as possible to give the rest of its team an advantage. However, because of its poor bulk, Galvantula needs to come in on predicted switches or very weak attacks. Volt Switch can be used to get chip damage or momentum against Pokemon that wall Galvantula such as Gigalith and Goodra.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It is best to pair Galvantula with slow, hard hitters that can take advantage of Sticky Web like Nidoqueen and Honchkrow. Sticky Web allows these wallbreakers and sweepers to become more threatening, as one of their biggest flaws, their Speed, is no longer an issue. Sticky Web also helps almost every hard hitter, allowing Pokemon such as Mismagius, Salazzle, Choice Specs Gardevoir, and Choice Band Tyrantrum to run through teams. Even faster Pokemon such as Aerodactyl appreciate Sticky Web slowing down potential revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Tyrantrum. Because Flying-types and Levitate users are immune to Sticky Web, Pokemon like Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Tyrantrum that can deal with common Flying-types such as Swellow are useful. Since much of Galvantula's utility stems from its access to Sticky Web, Taunt users and spinblockers such as Noivern, Mismagius, and Honchkrow are helpful to keep Sticky Web on the field. Competitive Milotic can also deter Defog.</p>"

  "Klinklang": {
    "overview": "<p>Klinklang is an unusual but effective sweeper that excels against conventional offensive teams. Magnet Rise allows it to surprise and set up on slower staple Pokemon that use Ground-type moves to beat Steel like Donphan, Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior. Other common setup fodder includes Florges, non-Thunder Wave Cresselia, and Choice-locked attackers like Gardevoir, Goodra, and Noivern. A single Shift Gear boost makes Klinklang faster than every Choice Scarf user except Noivern, and its typing grants resistance to common priority moves like First Impression and Ice Shard, so it's incredibly difficult to offensively check after setting up. Frailer teams are often unable to handle Klinklang's Steel + Electric coverage late-game, as it is only resisted by Electric-types and Water / Ground types. Balance teams without such Pokemon can be in trouble too. However, Klinklang's mediocre Attack forces it to run an Adamant nature, and it might need multiple boosts to take out bulky Pokemon like Registeel. A poor Speed tier that lies below Timid Mega Blastoise before a boost keeps Klinklang from being useful outside of late-game, when it sets up to sweep. Being a Steel-type gives Klinklang a lot of competition from Pokemon like Metagross and Registeel, which can use their valuable typing to handle Fairy- and Rock-types throughout the whole game. Using a Steel-type sweeper makes teambuilding with Klinklang much more difficult, as you miss out on that defensive presence. Gear Grind's shaky accuracy means bad luck alone can stop a Klinklang sweep, reducing Klinklang's consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Steelium Z gives Klinklang an objectively stronger Z-Move, better pressuring Electric-types, but the ability to hit Steel- and Water-types makes Electrium Z superior in the great majority of situations. Return over Magnet Rise provides a neutral hit on Electric- and Water / Ground types, but exploiting a Ground immunity is a large part of Klinklang's niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Ground-types</strong>: Water / Ground types Gastrodon and Seismitoad make sweeping with Klinklang all but impossible. Steelix also walls Klinklang's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Registeel and Bronzong must have taken significant prior damage to lose to +1 Gigavolt Havoc, often forcing Klinklang to use Shift Gear against them multiple times. They quickly weaken Klinklang back with Seismic Toss or Psywave. Even a healthy Metagross can rack up a lot of damage with Meteor Mash.</p> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: Life Orb-boosted Sucker Punch from Toxicroak, Lycanroc-D, or Honchkrow is the only priority attack that threatens much damage to Klinklang.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Depending on the matchup, Klinklang might not get any particularly safe setup opportunities. If it must use Magnet Rise, aggressive switches by the opponent can keep it from boosting in time to win. Klinklang can also get surprised by coverage moves such as Fire Blast on Nidoqueen.</p>",

      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear makes Klinklang nearly impossible to outspeed. Gear Grind and Wild Charge make for Klinklang's best two-move coverage. Magnet Rise lets Klinklang set up on Donphan, Metagross, non-Fire Blast Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Electrium Z gives Klinklang the best chance at beating bulky Water- and Steel-types like Slowbro, Milotic, Registeel, and Bronzong. An Adamant nature is necessary to compensate for Klinklang's unremarkable Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>From Team Preview, identify the Pokemon Klinklang can set up on late-game to win. These typically include team staples like Donphan, Metagross, and Nidoqueen as well as Choice-locked Pokemon like Gardevoir. Once the opposition is weakened enough for Klinklang to OHKO or 2HKO them all, lure the identified setup fodder into play. Against the Pokemon reliant on Ground-type moves, Magnet Rise should be free to use, as opponents unfamiliar with the rare Klinklang will likely just go for the super effective attack. Be careful against players you know are familiar with Klinklang, however, as they might switch to an offensive check on the turn Magnet Rise is used, taking momentum. A frailer offensive check will lose if Klinklang uses Shift Gear on the switch, though, so the opponent will have to win some mind games. Save Gigavolt Havoc for the bulkiest foe. Against typical offensive teams, this usually means Metagross, which is a source of setup but difficult to quickly take out from high HP. Defensive Steel- and Water-types like Registeel, Bronzong, Slowbro, and Milotic are ideal targets as well. Gigavolt Havoc might not even be necessary in some frail offense matchups. In such cases, you can try using Z-Magnet Rise to get an evasion boost, possibly circumventing Sucker Punch as well as Ground-types' and Metagross' attempts to weaken Klinklang. Pick weakened foes off with Wild Charge whenever possible, as Gear Grind can miss. Just make sure the recoil doesn't leave Klinklang vulnerable to priority. More defensive teams that feature Registeel and a Water-type are much harder for Klinklang to sweep, so unless a convenient KO happens, it should primarily be used to force switches from Steel-weak walls such as Florges and Cresselia to give wallbreaking teammates chances to come in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klinklang needs exploitable Pokemon to come in so it can set up; teammates that encourage Ground-types or Metagross to switch in include Tyrantrum, Raikou, and Mega Sceptile (Donphan likes to threaten it with Ice Shard), while Salazzle, Noivern, and Virizion are fast threats that demand attacks from Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir. Fighting-types like Virizion, Machamp, and Bewear excel at threatening Steel-types and breaking defensive cores, which Klinklang tends to falter against. A Spikes setter such as Golisopod or Roserade provides chip damage that makes sweeping with the somewhat weak Klinklang easier. If you can compensate for the stacked weaknesses, fitting a Metagross or Registeel on Klinklang's team for their greater defensive presence is still possible.</p>"

  "Virizion": {
    "overview": "<p>Virizion is one of the most dangerous offensive threats in RU with its amazing Speed tier that allows it to outpace threats such as Shaymin, Arcanine, and Fightinium Z Raikou, a stellar STAB combination, and the ability to boost its power with Swords Dance and Z-Moves. Virizion can offensively threaten to break through some of the top Pokemon in the metagame such as Mega Blastoise, Slowbro, Registeel, Milotic, and Rhyperior, turning these Pokemon into potential setup fodder. It is also very hard for most Pokemon to switch into Virizion, as most of its checks are worn down quickly or taken out by Stone Edge, though it requires good prediction to avoid losing momentum. Furthermore, a high Special Defense and access to recovery with Synthesis allow it to be a decent defensive check to Pokemon like Raikou, Milotic, and Mega Sceptile. Despite these amazing attributes, Virizion's attacking power is rather lackluster without a boost from Swords Dance or a Z-Move, making it checked rather easily by Pokemon like Toxicroak, Dragalge, and, if it lacks Stone Edge, Noivern. In spite of its great Special Defense, its low Defense prevents it from switching into Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Golisopod, and Tyrantrum as well as it could. Virizion can also be quickly worn down by entry hazards, weak attacks, and status conditions. This is especially true with Life Orb sets, since they are forced to use Synthesis more than they would like to, and not running Synthesis makes this even worse.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set with Giga Drain, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power Fire can give Virizion a greater defensive presence and allow it to act as a lure to more physically defensive Pokemon like Cresselia and Tangela. However, Calm Mind boosts Virizion's power only one stage, when it needs to be as powerful as possible and boost as fast as possible to be threatening. Lum Berry is an appealing option to relieve Virizion of status conditions and allow it to act as a switch-in to Scald users like Milotic and Slowbro, but it forces Virizion to lose its offensive presence by forgoing its Z-Move. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Pokemon that resist Virizion's STAB combination such as Toxicroak and Dragalge for super effective damage. However, this move doesn't really hit much else outside of these targets. Grassium Z can also be considered to threaten Pokemon like Cresselia, Necrozma, and Nidoqueen much more, but this option is rather niche compared to the wide coverage that Fightinium Z provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon like Toxicroak, Salazzle, and Dragalge resist Virizion's STAB combination and can OHKO it with their powerful moves. Keep in mind that Salazzle and Toxicroak do get worn down quickly with Stealth Rock damage and Life Orb recoil and can fall to a boosted All-Out Pummeling. All of these Pokemon need to be wary of the rare Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Due to Virizion's nasty 4x weakness to Flying-type attacks, Pokemon like Noivern, Yanmega, and Swellow can easily OHKO it. However, some of these Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Swellow, and Honchrow do not want to directly switch into an All-Out Pummeling or even Close Combat, since they don't resist this move, and the others do not want to directly switch into Stone Edge variants.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Gardevoir, Necrozma, Espeon, and Slowbro can all stomach an unboosted Close Combat from Virizion and can threaten it out of battle with their powerful STAB attacks. They do need to be careful about switching into Leaf Blade, especially if Virizion has boosted with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Virizion is very vulnerable to common revenge killers like Golisopod, Noivern, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Its low Defense stat on top of Close Combat's Defense drops can leave it revenge killed by Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, Machamp, and Zygarde-10%.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Since it uses physical attacks, defensive Pokemon like Cresselia and Tangela can take a hit from Virizion and usually force it out of the battle with super effective attacks or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon like Arcanine and Ninetales can take a Close Combat and threaten Virizion out of the battle, but they cannot switch into All-Out Pummeling or the rare Stone Edge or Continental Crush.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: All forms of status conditions threaten to shorten Virizion's time sweeping. Poison from Toxic puts it on a timer, burns make it lose offensive pressure, and paralysis cuts its great Speed.</p>",

Leaf Blade and Close Combat combined threaten many Pokemon in RU such as Mega Blastoise, Slowbro, and Registeel. Synthesis keeps Virizion healthy, allowing it to stay in battle and sweep much longer as well as check Zygarde-10% and Blastoise much better. Stone Edge can also be used to dissuade Pokemon like Noivern and Salazzle from directly switching in, which is especially great if Virizion's team has issues against these Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Virizion an immediate offensive presence and can help threaten to KO Salazzle, Ribombee, and Noivern after Stealth Rock damage if they switch into it, as well as potentially threatening an OHKO on Mandibuzz and Arcanine at +2 after Stealth Rock. Fightinium Z gives Virizion a one-use nuke to KO Pokemon like Arcanine and Ninetales without boosting as well as Metagross, Shaymin, and Mandibuzz at +2. It also bypasses the defense drops that come with using Close Combat. Justified's Attack boost combined with a Z-Crystal makes Virizion a good switch-in to Knock Off from users such as Machamp and Tangela and Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Virzion can function throughout the game by keeping itself healthy with Synthesis. It can wallbreak early in the game and potentially clean up late-game if its checks and counters have been dealt with prior. Virizion's raw damage output is lackluster, so set up with Swords Dance as soon as possible. It can use its high Special Defense, Synthesis, and typing to come in against and check Pokemon like Raikou, Rhyperior, Slowbro, and Milotic. It can even threaten these foes out and begin setting up or heal itself with Synthesis. Just be cautious against Scald or Toxic from some of these Pokemon and be wary of Synthesis's low PP. Virizion can also come in against Knock Off from Pokemon like Machamp, although this play is risky and not always worth the extra boost. All-Out Pummeling should be saved for a Pokemon like Arcanine, Metagross, Mandibuzz, or Bewear or to bypass the defense drops from Close Combat, allowing Virizion to have a better defensive presence against revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Tyrantrum or even priority users at low HP. Afterwards, be mindful of spamming Close Combat, as the defense drops make it lose out of its decent bulk. If running Stone Edge, Virizion can lure Pokemon that normally check Synthesis sets such as Noivern and Salazzle and KO them after Stealth Rock damage. Do not let Virizion be afflicted with status conditions, as they can cut its sweep short.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Metagross, Registeel, and Raikou make good teammates, since they can check the Flying-types that can cut Virizion's sweep short. Registeel and Metagross can also switch into Poison-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type attacks for Virizion as well as force these Pokemon out and take Toxic for it. In return, all of these Pokemon appreciate Virizion's ability to threaten out Ground-types. Similarly, partners such as Arcanine, Milotic, Rhyperior, and Tyrantrum can check the Fire-types that threaten Virizion out of battle. Status conditions threaten to stop Virizion from sweeping. Thus, Healing Wish users like Gardevoir and Shaymin can help keep it healthy if it wallbreaks early-game. Defensive teammates such as Cresselia, Snorlax, Slowbro, Porygon2, and Tangela also appreciate Virizion's ability to take Knock Off or Trick so they don't lose their items. Teammates like Machamp, Toxicroak, and Roserade appreciate Stone Edge Virizion's ability to lure and take out Noivern and Salazzle, while partners like Goodra, Ninetales, and Donphan appreciate Synthesis Virizion checking threats to them like Zygarde-10% and Mega Blastoise.</p>"

Unfortunately, Vivillon's terrible bulk compounded with a poor defensive typing that comes with a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock limits its opportunities to enter play and set up and makes it vulnerable to numerous priority users like Golisopod, Lycanroc-D, and Zygarde-10%. Furthermore, even after a boost, Vivillon fails to break past specially bulky Pokemon like Snorlax and Goodra as well as close the gap between particularly fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Houndoom, which means it requires a considerable amount of preparation and team support to successfully pull off a sweep. Lastly, Vivillon contests with Pokemon like Ribombee and Yanmega as offensive Bug-types, as their superior Speed tiers and immediate offensive pressure can be used to break apart teams with more ease. Other setup sweepers such as Salazzle and Virizion require less support to function and are much harder to stop with boosts.</p>",

Flyinium Z is a useful tool to muscle past Pokemon that can survive a +1 Hurricane such as Ninetales and Assault Vest Hariyama while bypassing most defensive checks if Vivillon is able to get multiple boosts. Leftovers is another option that allows Vivillon to use Substitute more often, which presents it with more opportunities to use Quiver Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid sending Vivillon in if Stealth Rock is on the field, as it greatly reduces Vivillon's longevity and puts it in range of priority moves such as Zygarde-10%'s Extreme Speed. Vivillon should also be brought in through slow pivots or forced switches, as its poor bulk can similarly leave it open to faster attackers. Aim to set up with Vivillon once specially bulky foes such as Snorlax and Goodra have been sufficiently weakened, as they can stomach even a boosted Z-Move and retaliate with a powerful attack. Similarly, have faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Salazzle and users of priority like Lycanroc-D eliminated before attempting to set up, since they're able to deny a sweep by outpacing +1 Vivillon and targeting its poor defensive stats and typing, though Vivillon can take out most Choice Scarf users with multiple boosts. Vivillon can best set up against forced switches and passive Pokemon, as the likes of Slowbro and Tangela can be threatened by Sleep Powder or a super effective move. Pokemon like Choice-locked Rhyperior and Shaymin are also ideal setup targets, as Vivillon can use its Ground immunity and set of resistances to exploit these foes. Substitute should be utilized against forced switches in order to ease setup with Quiver Dance and prevent priority users from revenge killing it. In situations where Vivillon is unable to successfully pull off a sweep, it can still utilize its fast and accurate Sleep Powder to cripple foes such as Registeel and Gigalith, which can greatly support its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Vivillon's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise and Donphan make for great teammates, as they're able to remove them from the field. Pokemon like Registeel, Metagross, and Roserade are capable of setting entry hazards themselves, chipping the opposition and allowing Vivillon to sweep more easily. Pivots like Flygon and Mega Ampharos are able to bring Vivillon into play safely, and Flygon is also able to lure setup targets like Slowbro and Cresselia. Passimian is a notable option, as it can break through various Pokemon Vivillon struggles against like Registeel, Gigalith, and Porygon2. Wallbreakers such as Metagross, Zygarde-10%, and Drapion can form an offensive core with Vivillon, and the former two appreciate its ability to set up on foes like Slowbro and Tangela. Most notably, Fighting-types such as Machamp, Toxicroak, and Virizion can break through various Pokemon that can take Vivillon's moves like the aforementioned Registeel and Porygon2. Priority users like Zygarde-10%, Golisopod, and Lycanroc-D can be problematic for Vivillon, so Pokemon like Slowbro, Dragalge, and Bronzong are respective switch-ins to their attacks and are capable of removing them outright.</p>"

  "Florges": {
    "overview": "<p>Florges has solidified itself as one of the best Fairy-types and defensive staples in the tier by virtue of its immense special bulk, allowing it to check threats such as Mega Blastoise, Noivern, and Mega Sceptile. Florges's access to Synthesis gives it instant recovery to consistently pivot into these threats, but you should be wary of the limited amount of PP Synthesis has. Florges's viability is further increased by its status as one of the few viable Wish users in the tier, as well as fulfilling the role of a cleric, which only Diancie gives it competition for. Florges also possesses a decent offensive presence with its above-average Special Attack in conjunction with a powerful STAB move in Moonblast. Unfortunately, very mediocre physical bulk means Florges struggles to directly switch into strong threats like Choice Band Bewear and Guts Machamp. While Florges does outspeed these threats, it will most likely be forced to use Synthesis in response in order to be able to pivot into them or other threats later. Although Florges provides a lot of utility for a team, it can be very passive, which allows threats like Metagross, Ninetales, and Arcanine to take advantage of it and fire off a strong attack or use it as a setup fodder, particularly in the former two's case.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more physically defensive set with a Bold nature can be utilized to allow Florges to switch into Fighting-types and other physically offensive Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Golisopod easier at the cost of not being able to outspeed some of the tier's prominent threats like Tyrantrum and Bewear. Florges can run Defog if the need for entry hazard removal and a cleric needs to be compressed into one slot. However, Florges loses to a lot of the hazard setters in the tier such as Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Bronzong. Florges can also be overworked with trying to perform so many roles for a team. Toxic can be used to put Pokemon like Calm Mind Raikou and Necrozma on a timer, allowing Florges to better handle them between Moonblast and spamming its recovery moves, but Florges struggles to compress this onto its set over other utility moves that benefit more teams. Coverage options like Psychic and Hidden Power Fire can be run to punish threats like Salazzle and Escavalier attempting to freely pivot into Florges. However, Florges faces a lot of competition with Gardevoir and Ribombee, other Fairy-types with access to these coverage moves that fulfill an offensive role better. A Calm Mind variant can be used to help Florges break through a few offensive teams and allow it to take on threats like Calm Mind Raikou and Necrozma better, but the tier has a vast amount of Steel- and Poison-types that can prevent the effectiveness of such a set. A set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 32 SpA / 224 Spe, a Modest nature, and Pixie Plate can be used to fulfill a similar role but gives Florges more offensive presence at the expense of some Defense. Choice-locked Florges using either a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs can be used as a surprise set to more easily revenge kill or wallbreak, respectively, but this is severely outclassed by Gardevoir in this regard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Escavalier and Metagross offensively pressure Florges and force something to have to switch into their strong STAB moves and coverage options. Other bulky Steel-types like Registeel and Bronzong can Toxic stall Florges out of Aromatherapy and use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Strong Poison-types like Salazzle, Roserade, and Nidoqueen are capable of taking advantage of Florges's passivity as an opportunity to fire off strong STAB moves. Salazzle is also able to use it as a chance to set up a Nasty Plot, while Roserade and Nidoqueen can set up entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock. However, all of these threats can be lured by Psychic variants.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers like Lycanroc-D and Alolan Marowak can easily overwhelm Florges thanks to its poor Defense, as both can OHKO it at +2 after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleric": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Moonblast hits relatively hard and has the chance to drop a foe's Special Attack by one stage, allowing Florges to check it more easily. Synthesis allows Florges to keep switching into threats like Mega Blastoise and Mega Sceptile without much fear. Aromatherapy provides a way to cure status conditions such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp from Florges and its team. Wish provides Florges with the ability to recover the health of its teammates, especially ones that lack reliable recovery such as Bronzong and Nidoqueen. This can also provide a way for Florges to recover its own health without Synthesis's limited PP and reduced recovery in sand and hail; this is vital because Synthesis is important for the immediate recovery against offensive teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>136 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Florges to outspeed and remove threats like Bewear and Adamant Tyrantrum. The rest of the EVs are put into its physical bulk to tank hits from the physical Fighting-types in the tier. Leftovers provide Florges with passive recovery to perform its role as a cleric for longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Florges should use its massive Special Defense stat and Fairy typing to switch into Pokemon like Yanmega, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Ampharos. Florges should also aim to support its teammates with Wish and cleric support; however, Aromatherapy should not be used too liberally due to its low PP. If Florges is up against a wall it can't beat like Bronzong or Registeel, it should refrain from using Aromatherapy unless a teammate desperately needs its status removed at the cost of Florges's health or getting crippled by status again. Florges invites a lot of threats like Escavalier, Ninetales, and Salazzle to fire off a strong hit. Ninetales and Salazzle can use Florges's passivity as a setup opportunity to start breaking, which means Florges should not use utility moves every opportunity it is given, as it can give up a lot of momentum. However, Florges can minimize the damage output these Pokemon can achieve by passing a Wish to a teammate that can pivot in more safely as a result. Wish should be used a lot early on in a match in comparison to Synthesis due to Synthesis's low PP, which can be vital against offensive teams that can deny it the opportunity to receive its own Wish. Florges has poor Defense, which means it struggles to switch into a lot of physical threats like Zygarde-10% and Guts Machamp. For example, a Guts-boosted Close Combat from Machamp is able to 2HKO Florges, which forces it into scenarios where it may need to use Synthesis, as otherwise it won't be able to constantly switch into other threats later. Therefore, avoid switching into these Pokemon too liberally, since it can get easily overwhelmed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Florges fits best on balanced and bulky offense teams that appreciate the utility it can provide for its members. Pokemon like Rhyperior and Mega Blastoise are fantastic partners that are capable of checking the Fire-types such as Arcanine and Salazzle that take advantage of Florges's passivity. These partners can also help remove most of the Steel-types in the tier that Florges is unable to pressure. In return, Florges checks Grass-types like Mega Sceptile, Shaymin, and Virizion that threaten them and can increase their longevity by providing valuable Wish and cleric support. Entry hazard removal from Mantine, Mandibuzz, and the aforementioned Mega Blastoise help take pressure off Florges, giving it more opportunities to recover health or use Aromatherapy. Steel-types like Escavalier and Metagross work really well with Florges by handling opposing Steel- and Poison-types, which Florges can't punish effectively. Likewise, Ground-types such as Donphan, Nidoqueen, and Zygarde-10% are able to offensively pressure these Steel- and Poison-types like Metagross and Toxicroak. Florges can provide them with Wish and cleric support to prevent them from getting easily worn down in exchange. Setup Pokemon like Calm Mind Cresselia and Curse Snorlax appreciate Florges's ability to cure them of status ailments that hinder their ability to sweep, and in return, they can pivot into specially offensive Poison-types like Nidoqueen and Roserade. Virizion and Calm Mind Raikou are alternative setup sweepers that benefit massively from Florges curing their status conditions, allowing them to accumulate multiple boosts and increasing their longevity. Pokemon that lack and appreciate a form of substantial recovery such as Bronzong and Mega Ampharos work superbly with Florges thanks to its access to Wish support.</p>"

  "Pangoro": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to Pangoro's insane Attack stat, coverage, and STAB attacks, it has paved itself a path to being one of the scariest wallbreakers in the tier. Pangoro can utilize a Choice Band set, making it an even more powerful wallbreaker. In addition to this, Pangoro has access to Swords Dance, which can destroy teams that rely on passive cores such as Registeel + Slowbro if all of its checks have been removed from the field. However, it suffers from a fairly low Speed stat and poor defensive typing, which makes it revenge killed easily. Due to this, Defensive Pokemon such as Florges and Mandibuzz can neutralize it with enough Speed creep. In addition to Pangoro's Speed stat, it's typing gives it a weakness to Fairy-types, Flying-types, and Fighting-types such as Florges, Noivern, and Virizion, which are all very prominent in the tier. Furthermore, Pangoro has fierce competition with the plethora of other Fighting-types in the tier, including Virizion, Bewear, and Passimian, all of which either have better Speed tiers, reliable recovery, or better natural bulk. Due to this, finding a spot to fit Pangoro on a team is difficult, which ultimately results in its lack of usage. Although all of the former is true, Pangoro is extremely difficult to pivot around which makes it a valid option as a Fighting-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Jolly nature can be used to outpace Adamant Bewear, which can be useful from time to time, but it severely cuts into Pangoro's offensive capability. Scrappy is another amazing offensive ability that can be used with Superpower or Drain Punch to avoid predicting around Ghost-types such as Palossand or Mismagius on the switch. However, Ghost types are already reluctant to switch in on Pangoro, as they fear being hit by Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters.</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: While Fairy-types such as Gardevoir, Florges, and Diancie don't appreciate Bullet Punch or Gunk Shot, they can either outspeed it or take an unboosted Bullet Punch and then proceed to OHKO Pangoro with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: The plethora of faster Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Passimian, Virizion, and Toxicroak, all scare Pangoro out. Toxicroak resists both of Pangoro's STAB types, making it a more reliable check. Passimian has above-average physical bulk, which makes it a good check to Pangoro. However, no Fighting-type wants to switch into a +2 Pangoro, as most of them will take massive damage and be ultimately crippled for the rest of the match.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon such as Noivern, Mandibuzz, and Golbat outspeed Pangoro and threaten it with their STAB moves in Hurricane and Brave Bird. None of them appreciate directly switching into Pangoro, though, especially if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Pangoro's lacking Speed tier, it can easily be revenge killed by a plethora of faster offensive Pokemon, including Noivern, Mega Sceptile, Salazzle, Passimian, and Virizion. While some of these revenge killers need previous chip in order to successfully revenge kill Pangoro, a handful of them can flat out come in and OHKO it. However, it should be taken into account that all of these revenge killers can be knocked out via Bullet Punch if they don't have enough HP remaining.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Pangoro's most spammable move due to its secondary effect of removing the foe's item. Drain Punch gives Pangoro a strong Fighting-type STAB and some passive recovery. This is important, as it helps Pangoro come in more frequently to dish out powerful attacks. Bullet Punch is a fairly weak but necessary on Choice Band Pangoro, as it KOes Fairy-types such as Diancie, Florges, and Gardevoir with just a little bit of chip and can revenge kill weakened faster Pokemon in general. Moreover, Superpower provides Pangoro with an even stronger Fighting-type STAB move that deals immense damage to anything that can afford to take a hit. Superpower allows Pangoro to always 2HKO slow Milotic, and it has a shot to 2HKO Tangela after Stealth Rock damage. While this all sounds promising, Drain Punch is ultimately the most useful STAB move, as it still is extremely strong due to Iron Fist and it lets gives Pangoro longevity. Superpower also has the drawback of lowering Pangoro's Attack and Defense every single time it is used. This is annoying as it makes Pangoro easier to pivot around which negates one of its main assests. Gunk Shot can be utilized to destroy any Fairy-types that may want to switch in on an expected Dark- or Fighting-type move. However, Bullet Punch is usually more useful, as the only thing Gunk Shot really provides is a guaranteed OHKO on Florges, which is often faster than Pangoro anyway. Thunder Punch gives Pangoro a midground option that hits the likes of Slowbro, Milotic, and Mandibuzz.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pangoro's EV spread is straightforward with maximum Attack and maximum Speed investment combined with an Adamant nature, allowing Pangoro to dish out the most damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pangoro loves to be brought in via slow U-turns and Volt Switches and fire off immensely powerful attacks that punch holes through the opponent's team. Pangoro doesn't have the greatest bulk, so it can be easily worn down, which is why it loves to be brought in safely instead of through a manual switch. Pangoro should be brought in as much as possible throughout the early phase of the match as it helps break down defensive cores due to its amazing coverage options. If the opponent lacks a suitable Pangoro check, then every single time Pangoro is on the field unthreatened, it can very easily claim a KO. Pangoro should typically utilize Knock Off the most, as it is an easily spammable move due to its secondary effect of removing the foe's item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pangoro can find itself useful on a bunch of different teams, varying from hyper offense to even balance. It loves being brought in via VoltTurn synergy, making Noivern, Flygon, and Vikavolt amazing partners for Pangoro. Noivern can also lure in Rock- and Steel-types so Pangoro can come in and deal out another powerful attack. Pokemon such as Registeel, Salazzle, Escavalier, and Roserade punish Fairy-types for Pangoro, while Pokemon such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Golisopod eat up Fighting-type attacks. Setup sweepers such as Raikou, Necrozma, and the aforementioned Salazzle appreciate Pangoro's wallbreaking capabilities making it easier for them to set up and clean late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is Pangoro's most spammable move, as not only is it a strong attack due to Iron Fist and Life Orb, but it also recovers a decent amount of HP. Knock Off is Pangoro's main Dark-type STAB attack that can dish out powerful attacks. Bullet Punch is absolutely pivotal on Swords Dance Pangoro, helping it out against weakened faster attacks as well as dealing with Fairy-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb further increases Pangoro's offensive prowess. Combined with a +2 Attack boost from Swords Dance, Pangoro with Life Orb is devastating to switch into. However, Life Orb recoil may become troublesome in more drawn-out games. Lum Berry is another option as an item, as it allows Pangoro to be cured once from any burns or poisons that could trouble its sweeping or wallbreaking ability. This can be useful for setting up on Pokemon such as Registeel and Milotic, which want to cripple Pangoro by statusing it. This can put Pangoro in an amazing position, as it now has complete momentum and +2 Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pangoro can be extremely useful without even using Swords Dance, as its amazing offensive typing allows it to deal with the likes of Snorlax, Bronzong, Slowbro, and Gigalith. Due to this, if it is noted that Pangoro will have a tough time being able to set up, it can easily just spam its STAB moves in Knock Off and Drain Punch. If the opportunity arises, Pangoro can afford to set up where Bullet Punch could clean up any faster attackers. However, Swords Dance Pangoro is typically used more as a wallbreaker. Pangoro should mainly be brought in through slow U-turn or passive attacks, as its moderate bulk doesn't allow it to take many hits. If Pangoro wants to come in to set up, it should do so after an allied Pokemon has fainted or it has been brought onto the field without taking any unnecessary residual damage. This Pangoro set can also take advantage of common cores such as Registeel + Slowbro and blow them away with its strong STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Pangoro loves to be paired with bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and bulky Necrozma, as one of its primary threats is the plethora of faster Fighting-types that can revenge kill it. Swords Dance Pangoro also adores Pokemon that can chip away at faster threats so that it can sweep with more ease. This can include Spikes or Toxic Spikes users like Roserade and Dragalge as well as Pokemon that can utilize Toxic effectively such as Slowbro, Bronzong, and Registeel. The latter Bronzong and Registeel deserve a special mention for many reasons, as they can eat up Fairy-type attacks, provide Stealth Rock, and chip away foes with Toxic, Seismic Toss, or Psywave. Faster revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Flygon appreciate Pangoro's wallbreaking capability, which allows them to clean up or help Pangoro out by removing faster threats that force it out.</p>"

  "Barbaracle": {
    "overview": "<p>Barbaracle has been making waves in RU thanks to its Shell Smash set, which lets it boost its already good offensive abilities to greater levels. It has reasonably good bulk and a decent typing that let it set up on a plethora of Choice Scarf users, such as Gardevoir and Tyrantrum. Barbaracle's great movepool gives it many options for its last moveslot, giving it the potential to pick and choose what counterplay it wants to beat. For example, it can run Protect to beat teams relying on First Impression Golisopod as their counterplay. Barbaracle also has an incredible Speed stat after using Shell Smash, only outpaced by Choice Scarf users like Salazzle and Noivern. That being said, Barbaracle is very easy to pressure and remove by playing aggressively with Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-types like Virizion, Bewear, and Zygarde-10%. Although hard to revenge kill after boosting, Barbaracle's mediocre Speed tier prior to boosting leaves it vulnerable to common attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerial Ace gives Barbaracle a way to hit Pokemon like Toxicroak and Virizion that are resistant to its STAB moves. Protect lets Barbaracle beat priority users, namely Golisopod. However, Golisopod also commonly runs Aqua Jet, so Barbaracle will still lose the matchup if it is chipped as it sets up. Taunt can be run in the last slot to give Barbaracle more potential against stall teams carrying Pyukumuku. Earthquake gives Barbaracle a way around one of its best and most common checks, Metagross. Barbaracle can chip Metagross the first time it switches in with Earthquake and, if Metagross has taken enough damage, set up with Shell Smash after and outright beat it. However, Earthquake is hard to justify using because Metagross is easy to chip down even without Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Barbaracle struggles to set up on Pokemon that carry status-inducing moves. For example, Registeel and Bronzong can inflict it with Toxic poison, limiting its ability to sweep. Other Pokemon like Porygon2 and Cresselia can cripple it with paralysis, but keep in mind that Barbaracle can prevent status by setting up a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: First Impression from Golisopod, Sucker Punch from Honchkrow, and Bullet Punch from Medicham are all capable of revenge killing Barbaracle after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Checks</strong>: Bewear and Metagross are able to tank an attack after Barbaracle has used Shell Smash and have the potential to KO it back. Other Choice Scarf users, such as Salazzle, and quick Pokemon, like Stoutland under sand and Venusaur under sun, are capable of outpacing and revenge killing Barbaracle.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Extremely bulky physically defensive walls, such as Slowbro and Tangela, are capable of taking Continental Crush from Barbaracle and KOing it in return. Other Pokemon like physically defensive Umbreon have the potential to check Barbaracle as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash gives Barbaracle the potential to sweep through entire teams. Liquidation is Barbaracle's main STAB attack that lets it hit Ground-types and gives it a more accurate option over Stone Edge. Stone Edge is a STAB attack that has the opportunity to act as a nuke thanks to its Z-Move. Low Kick lets Barbaracle run over Steel-types like Registeel that could otherwise live any of its attacks and cripple it with Toxic. Low Kick also prevents Barbaracle from wasting its Z-Move against other potential checks like Virizion. Substitute also helps mitigate any chance of wasting its Z-Move. For example, if the opponent tries to lure out Barbaracle's Continental Crush by switching out from a wall into something they're sacrificing to the Z-Move, you can capitalize on this by setting up a Substitute. This lets Barbaracle keep its Z-Move and gives it the opportunity to Shell Smash again.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tough Claws boosts Liquidation and Low Kick, improving Barbaracle's chances against sturdier walls. The EV investment in Attack gives Barbaracle more wallbreaking potential. The 252 Speed EVs let it outpace Choice Scarf users that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it. Rockium Z lets Barbaracle break through robust walls like Milotic and offensive checks like Toxicroak and Virizion. A Jolly nature prevents Barbaracle from being outpaced by Choice Scarf users like Shaymin.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Choice Scarf Pokemon like Gardevoir by using them for free setup. If your opponent Pursuit traps one of your teammates with a Pokemon like Drapion or Sneasel, capitalize on that by freely setting up with Barbaracle the next turn. Play wisely against walls, knowing that your opponent will likely try to lure out Barbaracle's Z-Move before trying to check it with a wall. If Barbaracle lacks the specific move to handle checks like Metagross, make sure to wear them down over time with Barbaracle's teammates before attempting to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters, like Metagross, are important to use alongside Barbaracle, as the extra chip damage lets Barbaracle break past Pokemon like physically defensive Slowbro and Porygon2 that can check it in a pinch. Steel-types are great teammates that can switch into Grass-types, which Barbaracle struggles with. A good example is Registeel, which can also provide the aforementioned Stealth Rock. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Gardevoir and Choice Band Drapion help break through teams, giving Barbaracle more sweeping potential. Drapion can also remove a defensive check in Bronzong and remove items like Porygon2's Eviolite for Barbaracle. Hyper offensive teams can use dual screens from Meowstic-M. Memento support from Gardevoir on balance or hyper offense supports Barbaracle, giving it an almost guaranteed setup opportunity.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dragalge is a versatile Pokemon with access to an amazing ability in Adaptability and a stellar movepool to boot, utilizing moves such as Draco Meteor, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast to break through Fairy-types such as Florges much more easily than other Dragon-types. Boasting a Poison / Dragon typing, Dragalge is able to switch into many threatening offensive Pokemon in the RU tier such as Ninetales, Virizion, Raikou, Salazzle, Toxicroak, and Roserade. Dragalge's access to Toxic Spikes and ability to absorb them are what really forms its niche in the tier, giving it an edge over other special Dragon-types like Goodra, which it faces heavy competition from because of the latter's better Speed and coverage. However, Dragalge is cursed with being one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier and is prone to being forced out by offensive pressure due to its very lacking Speed tier, which makes it very susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Necrozma, Gardevoir, and Zygarde-10%. In addition, Dragalge's lack of reliable recovery makes it extremely susceptible to chip damage, which can hinder it throughout the game. Dragalge can also be forced out and Pursuit trapped for quite a bit of damage by Pokemon like Metagross and Drapion, which hinders its ability to comfortably beat Salazzle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with Black Sludge and Protect can work, but this set isn’t very good when compared to Dragalge's offensive set because it isn’t able to switch into as many foes and apply the offensive pressure that Dragalge normally should. Other coverage, such as Hidden Power Fire or Shadow Ball can be run to hit Steel-types like Metagross, Escavalier and Bronzong more accurately, but besides them it isn't optimal in comparison to Focus Blast. Sludge Wave gets a guaranteed OHKO on Virizion without Choice Specs, unlike Sludge Bomb, but the increased poison chance is more useful in most situations.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Gardevoir, Sigilyph, Necrozma, and Espeon are all huge banes to Dragalge's viability, due to their ability to easily take out Dragalge with their STAB moves; however, they're unable to switch into Dragalge. Gardevoir specifically can Trace Adaptability and become a huge threat with its boosted dual STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Walls</strong>: Cresselia, Mantine, and Porygon2 can withstand a Draco Meteor and shrug off the damage with their respective recovery options, but they struggle to deal with Dragalge if they're poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Dragalge can dent Steel-types with Focus Blast, it's unable to switch into them because they limit Dragalge’s ability to spam its STAB attacks, completely shutting it down if it’s locked into one of them. A lot of these Pokemon can be used as an opportunity to get up a layer of Toxic Spikes, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Zygarde-10%, Nidoqueen, Donphan, and Rhyperior are able to eviscerate Dragalge after a Special Attack drop or if it's locked into Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that naturally outpace Dragalge such as Tyrantrum and Goodra cannot switch into Dragalge but can take it on with their respective STAB moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Dragalge's strongest STAB move; with the boost from Adaptability and Dragalge's decent Special Attack stat, it is able to significantly damage almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Sludge Bomb is used to hit Grass and Fairy-types like Virizion and Florges. It is also more spammable than Draco Meteor due to it not dropping Dragalge's Special Attack stat after repeated use, and its 30% poison chance means you can fish for poison against walls like Porygon2, Mantine, and Cresselia. Focus Blast allows Dragalge to hit Steel-types that would otherwise wall it such as Registeel, Metagross, Escavalier, and Forretress. Toxic Spikes allows Dragalge to spread poison against grounded Pokemon. This lets Dragalge’s teammates break the opposing team a lot easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Investing 52 EVs in Speed will allow Dragalge to outrun neutral-natured base 50s like Donphan, Diancie, and Registeel. Maximum Special Attack with a Modest nature increases Dragalge's damage output to insane amounts. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP, maximizing Dragalge's potential bulk. Choice Specs gives Dragalge an immediate boost to its Special Attack, turning it into a potent wallbreaker that can easily punch holes through opposing teams. Dragonium Z can be used for an ridiculously powerful one time nuke with 195 Base Power that ignores the effects of Draco Meteor so your Special Attack doesn't drop. Hidden Power Fire can be used as a reliable alternative to Focus Blast, as it can OHKO both Forretress and offensive Escavalier and does more damage to Metagross whereas Choice Specs Focus Blast can miss and still doesn't 2HKO Registeel after a Protect.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should pivot Dragalge into Pokemon it can handle such as Ninetales, Virizion, Arcanine, Salazzle, and Roserade. However, Dragalge can't freely pivot around, as it does not possess any form of recovery, meaning that it will lose a massive amount of health throughout the game if you switch it in too liberally, which will ultimately cripple it's ability to break walls consistently. On forced switches, it's often more useful to set Toxic Spikes with Dragalge rather than attacking. It's often fine to set Toxic Spikes with its Choice Specs set, too, but you should also attempt to break walls down more, so assess which is more useful. If your opponent has Pokemon that can combat Toxic Spikes, such as Metagross, Toxicroak, and Salazzle, focus more on attacking rather than using turns to get up layers of Toxic Spikes. While Draco Meteor is extremely powerful, try not to use it an excessive amount of times, due to your Special Attack dropping with each use. However, Sludge Bomb can freely be used since it does not drop Dragalge's Special Attack like Draco Meteor. Sludge Bomb also has a Poison chance which can be useful if you're unable to get up Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragalge's main appeal is Toxic Spikes, meaning that it particularly shines on balance and bulky offense teams. Because of this, Pokemon that can use Dragalge’s Toxic Spikes to their advantage by stalling out poison turns like Raikou and Mega Sceptile make for excellent teammates. It's important to have entry hazard removal to make sure that Dragalge isn't chipped by hazards, so Pokemon like Mega Blastoise make for good teammates. Additionally, Mega Blastoise can also take on the Ice-types that can be annoying for Dragalge to deal with. Steel-types like Bronzong, Metagross, and Registeel provide a solid check to Psychic-types like Gardevoir for Dragalge. They can also set Stealth Rock, forming a strong hazard stacking core. Ground-types such as Rhyperior, Donphan, and Zygarde-10% can pressure Poison-types that are able to absorb Dragalge's Toxic Spikes, giving it more freedom to set entry hazards. Because Ground-types are good checks to Dragalge, it's important to possess check to them like Virizion and Shaymin. In return, Dragalge is able to wall the Poison-types that they struggle against, like Roserade. Pokemon that learn Spikes such as Golisopod, Roserade, and Forretress can form a strong hazard stacking core alongside Dragalge.</p>"

  "Tyrantrum": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyrantrum's most defining trait is its access to Rock Head and STAB Head Smash, giving it an absurdly powerful attack with no immediate drawbacks that dents any Pokemon that does not resist it and lets it act as a powerful holepuncher or cleaner. Rock is a powerful offensive typing, granting Tyrantrum good coverage against a majority of the tier and making Head Smash quite spammable. Tyrantrum has good neutral coverage and a considerably wide movepool, although all it really needs are moves that take on the few Pokemon in the tier that can consistently withstand its Head Smashes. These qualities present Tyrantrum as one of the tier's most potent attackers and holepunchers. However, Tyrantrum's Speed is noticeably lacking as a Choice Scarf user, failing to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Mega Sceptile. Tyrantrum's low Special Defense combined with its awkward defensive typing and multitude of weaknesses often turns it into a defensive liability, making Tyrantrum function as a glass cannon. Tyrantrum is thus heavily reliant on its few physical resistances and 4x resistance to Fire to avoid getting 2HKOed by invested attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyrantrum has access to Dragon Dance, which can be paired with a Z-Move such as Continental Crush, Devastating Drake, or even Tectonic Rage, but Tyrantrum's mediocre Speed even at +1 makes it much easier to revenge kill, and it lacks the immediate power that Tyrantrum prefers for wallbreaking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Donphan can take Choice Band Head Smash and retaliate with powerful super effective STAB Ground-type attacks. Faster Ground-types such as Flygon may be 2HKOed by Choice Band Head Smash, but they can outrun Tyrantrum and threaten it with Ground-type attacks. However, none of them want to switch into Choice Band Outrage, and Flygon is still 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Tyrantrum's Head Smash, meaning it wants a Choice Scarf of its own to consistently check Tyrantrum.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong resist Head Smash and retaliate with Steel-type STAB attacks or status ailments. However, it should be noted that Bronzong takes a lot of damage from Choice Band Head Smash, and Tyrantrum has coverage moves to hit them with, such as Earthquake for Registeel and Crunch for Bronzong. Escavalier can attempt to stomach one attack from Tyrantrum and fire back with Iron Head, although Escavalier's unboosted Iron Head won't be able to OHKO Tyrantrum without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Offensive Fighting-types such as Virizion and Toxicroak outrun Choice Band Tyrantrum and threaten with super effective Fighting-type STAB attacks. Other Fighting-types like Bewear and Sawk beat every variant of Tyrantrum 1v1, and Choice Scarf Passimian can handle most variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Tyrantrum dislikes taking hits, as it takes substantial damage from nearly any sort of invested attack, and being able to take it down before it can move is a great way to limit its damage output. Choice Band Tyrantrum is easy to deal with in this regard, as it is rather slow and thus falls prey to various faster Pokemon, such as Shaymin, Mega Glalie, Goodra, and Sneasel, but be aware that most offensive Pokemon that fail to OHKO Tyrantrum risk getting OHKOed in return. Choice Scarf Tyrantrum is harder to outrun, but faster Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir, Flygon, Shaymin, and Speed Boost Pokemon such as Yanmega, and weather sweepers such as Venusaur can revenge kill Tyrantrum and prevent it from cleaning. Tyrantrum's high Defense stat means it can take most priority moves, but Ice Shard from Mega Glalie and Sucker Punch from Honchkrow can still do decent damage.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is Tyrantrum's primary STAB move, crushing a large majority of offensive Pokemon and potentially 2HKOing even those that resist it, such as Flygon and Virizion. Outrage hits offensive Pokemon that resist Rock, notably OHKOing Flygon while doing substantial damage to Virizion. It also can be a good late-game cleaning tool, as it boasts perfect accuracy over Head Smash. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Registeel. Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB move that can pick off weakened foes or opposing Dragon-types, such as Flygon, Zygarde-10%, and Goodra, with much less risk than its other STAB attacks. However, it's only barely stronger than a resisted Head Smash, so it's usually not worth going for in most cases. Toxic can be an option, and while it is not a move you'd choose in a majority of circumstances, it may be the only way Tyrantrum can have some presence against bulky Pokemon that can heal off its blows such as Cresselia and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is necessary for Choice Scarf Tyrantrum to outspeed the likes of Jolteon, Swellow, and Salazzle, and full Attack investment simply maximizes the power of Head Smash for it to effortlessly KO most offensive Pokemon that don't resist it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tyrantrum's main role is to threaten offensive teams with Head Smash, which has enough power to 2HKO Flygon and Virizion after Stealth Rock damage, meaning that offensive teams have limited switch-ins to Tyrantrum and are quite prone to losing Pokemon to it. Keep an eye out for offensive Pokemon like Rhyperior that can switch into Head Smash and try to hit them with the appropriate coverage move or pull a double switch to maintain offensive momentum. However, be wary of any Fairy-types present if attempting to use Outrage, as it can mean Tyrantrum's premature end. Be sure to capitalize on Choice Scarf Tyrantrum's power over Aerodactyl, which checks most of the Pokemon Tyrantrum does while being able to switch moves and have access to Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Tyrantrum set is designed to prey on offensive teams, partners that can take on bulkier teams are appreciated. Escavalier is a very solid teammate, as it can switch into and threaten Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-type Pokemon for Tyrantrum and help put additional pressure on bulky Pokemon that intend to take hits from Tyrantrum, skewering the likes of Cresselia and Slowbro. Escavalier can also Pursuit trap Bronzong, removing another obstacle for Tyrantrum. In turn, Tyrantrum can protect Escavalier from Fire-type attacks and threaten a vast majority of fast Pokemon. Other wallbreakers and holepunchers include Flame Orb Machamp, Pangoro, Shaymin, and Toxicroak, which can harass slower teams, but be mindful of their shared weaknesses with Tyrantrum.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is Tyrantrum's main STAB attack and is strong enough to 2HKO Bronzong, meaning only the bulkiest of Pokemon that resist Rock can hope to stomach it. Outrage dents Ground- and Fighting-types looking to resist Head Smash, heavily damages Donphan, 2HKOes Rhyperior after Stealth Rock damage, and is accurate, unlike Head Smash. Earthquake's main use is to smash Pokemon like Registeel and Steelix that can take Tyrantrum's STAB moves.</p> <p>Tyrantrum's last moveslot is largely filler, and it is mostly used to help Tyrantrum continue wallbreaking targets while still making it difficult for checks to switch in. Superpower helps to take out bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon and Snorlax while still deterring Steel-types such as Bronzong and Registeel from switching in. Crunch can be used to 2HKO specially defensive Cresselia without the risky effects of Head Smash and Outrage as well as cripple Bronzong. Dragon Claw is an option by virtue of simply being a safe STAB move to throw out, notably being able to damage Head Smash switch-ins without locking into Outrage, but its wallbreaking power is low otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature with a Choice Band maximizes Tyrantrum's damage output against bulky Pokemon. A Jolly nature may be used to get the drop on the 242 speed tier, which includes relevant Pokemon like Florges, Mandibuzz, and Cresselia.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyrantrum primarily targets slower Pokemon, against which it can use Head Smash and brutalize any Pokemon that doesn't resist the move. Head Smash's obscene power and lack of a crippling drawback aside from accuracy mean this will be Tyrantrum's most used attack. While Tyrantrum can predict the opponent's switch to a bulky Pokemon that resists Rock and use its other moves to nail them coming in, the best time for Tyrantrum to use its coverage moves is if they can KO the initial target while covering the switch at the same time. Since the opponent will rarely have more than one Pokemon that can take Head Smashes well, Tyrantrum usually only needs to get a single correct prediction to be free to spam Head Smash throughout the match. Against more offensive teams, Tyrantrum is not expected to survive for long due to its middling Speed and common weaknesses. Thus, it should focus on busting open a huge hole whenever it can, taking advantage of any slower or offensively weaker Pokemon on the opponent's team as well as the fact that they do not possess good switch-ins to Tyrantrum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast Pokemon that can clean games, such as Swellow, Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%, Salazzle, and Yanmega, make great partners to Tyrantrum, as these Pokemon greatly appreciate Tyrantrum softening up the foe's team to have an easier time sweeping. Tyrantrum can also lure out and weaken or KO problematic Pokemon for these sweepers, such as Bronzong and Rhyperior, as well as provide mild defensive synergy with Salazzle, as it resists Fairy-, Steel-, and Ice-type moves for it. Tyrantrum especially appreciates VoltTurn support to be able to switch into bulky Pokemon with minimal risk and can be provided by fast Pokemon such as Swellow, Noivern, Raikou, and Flygon. Tyrantrum also benefits from many forms of speed control, such as Sticky Web and paralysis, to gain an advantage against faster targets, making any potential users of these moves, such as Galvantula, Cresselia, Slowbro, and Porygon2 helpful teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is Tyrantrum's secondary STAB move, and coupled with Dragonium Z, it can be used to hit most Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Bewear. However, locking into Outrage can be very dangerous if the opponent has a Fairy- or Steel-type that can KO Tyrantrum, such as Gardevoir or Metagross. Earthquake lets Tyrantrum hit Steel-types such as Registeel, which resist both of its STAB moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Tyrantrum to maximize its offensive presence. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Shaymin and Flygon, which would otherwise revenge kill Tyrantrum after a Rock Polish. However, sacrificing those advantages for an Adamant nature is an option if you prefer the extra power behind Tyrantrum's attacks, notably allowing it to OHKO Shaymin after some prior chip damage. Dragonium Z allows Tyrantrum to bypass its would-be checks, such as Rhyperior and Bewear, while Rockium Z lets it drop a nuke on neutral targets while bypassing Head Smash's shaky accuracy. If already using a Z-Move on your team, Rock Incense is a decent option to strengthen the power of Head Smash. This does lack the explosive power of Z-Moves that lets Tyantrum get past specific checks, though. Groundium Z is a serviceable option that lets Tyrantrum nail Pokemon such as non-Shuca Berry Metagross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rock Polish Tyrantrum is able to bluff a Choice Scarf set, being able to set up on frail, offensive Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Ninetales, and Swellow that fear its Choice Scarf set while also having a decent matchup versus bulkier teams due to the one-time nuke that Dragonium Z provides. Due to Tyrantrum's decent defensive typing, it is able to find setup opportunities from switching into common offensive Pokemon like Salazzle and setting up as they're forced out. Tyrantrum also finds setup opportunities on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Escavalier locked into Pursuit. Be wary of clicking Outrage when a Fairy-type such as Florges or Gardevoir is present on the opponent's field since the Fairy-type would gain a free turn. Against bulkier teams, make sure to gauge when the time is right to use the Z-Move, as eliminating a Rock-resistant Pokemon early-game can be extremely beneficial for Tyrantrum and leave it far less prediction reliant. For example, if you successfully eliminate a Rhyperior early-game, Tyrantrum can more easily spam Head Smash with little consequence. Steel-types such as Bronzong should be eliminated before attempting a Tyrantrum sweep, since they aren't hit by Earthquake hard enough and can stop a +2 Tyrantrum in its tracks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Mega Abomasnow, Ninetales, and Choice Band Escavalier can pave the way for a Tyrantrum sweep due to them being able to wear down common answers for it, such as Bronzong. Pursuit from the likes of Escavalier and Drapion is able to weaken Pokemon like Bronzong and Cresselia for Tyrantrum. Tyrantrum appreciates support from Spikes setters like Roserade, Mega Glalie, and Golisopod, since many of its checks, such as Shuca Berry Metagross and Nidoqueen, lack reliable recovery, making them prone to being weakened by repeated switches into spikes. Pokemon that can beat opposing Steel-types are a must, since Tyrantrum cannot sweep if they are present. Bewear and Fire Blast Nidoqueen are good examples of wallbreakers that can neuter Steel-types. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Virizion are able to depend on Tyrantrum to take Fire- and Flying-type attacks for them and set up on these attacks. In return, Grass-types can weaken prominent Ground-types like Rhyperior, which threaten Tyrantrum's ability to sweep.</p>"

  "Goodra": {
    "overview": "<p>Goodra's ability and typing, which give it a Grass-type immunity and Electric, Fire, and Water resistances, combined with great bulk let Goodra act as a fantastic sponge that can check offensive threats such as Roserade, Raikou, Ninetales, and Salazzle and switch into bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Milotic. On top of this, Goodra's respectable Speed gives it the ability to run Choice Scarf, outpacing Choice Scarf Tyrantrum and Aerodactyl. Goodra's solid Special Attack and amazing coverage make Choice Specs also great, as it renders Goodra hugely threatening to bulky offense and balance teams by hitting a wide range of Pokemon. However, Choice Scarf Goodra is pressured by popular Fairy- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Florges and Registeel, which are easily able to switch into most of its attacks and can use Goodra as setup fodder if it isn't careful about what it locks itself into. Furthermore, Goodra has no reliable recovery and is easily chipped away by status, entry hazards, and Pokemon that it can check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest Goodra with Dragon Tail in order to phaze checks can be used to more reliably check special attackers. However, this set is worse than both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf because it is checked easier by bulky Pokemon and its only value over other Assault Vest users in the tier is its Grass immunity. Choice Band Goodra can also be used in favor of Choice Specs to wallbreak. However, Outrage is an unreliable move that makes it easy for revenge killers to KO Goodra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Goodra, especially the Choice Scarf set, is walled heavily by Florges and forced out. The Choice Specs set is pressured and is forced into making a prediction if a Fairy-type such as Gardevoir or Florges is on the opposing team. Goodra is reluctant to spam Draco Meteor and has to get a Sludge Wave off on Florges to do anything.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel and Bronzong are very bulky and can take multiple Fire Blasts from Choice Scarf Goodra. Goodra is forced to predict when Steel-types are going to be switched in and is pressured by this. Unfortunately, Goodra still needs to hit multiple Fire Blasts even if getting the prediction right.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Goodra is very easily revenge killed by faster Dragon-type Pokemon such as Zygarde-10% and Flygon.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Goodra's poor Defense, physically strong Pokemon that outspeed Goodra such as Virizion, Zygarde-10%, Flygon, and Lycanroc-D will almost always force it out.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Assault Vest Slowking are easy switch-ins to Goodra, especially when the Choice Scarf set is used. Other Pokemon like Mantine, Florges, and specially defensive Mandibuzz can only be hit hard if hit with the correct move or if Goodra is running Choice Specs.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Goodra's most powerful STAB move and dishes out high damage on targets hit neutrally by it. Thunderbolt is used to hit Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise and Araquanid. Fire Blast is used for coverage on Steel-type Pokemon such as Metagross and Registeel. Earthquake allows Goodra to deal with Calm Mind Raikou and more reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Salazzle, as its accuracy is superior to that of Draco Meteor. Ice Beam can be used over Draco Meteor to hit Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Noivern, Flygon, and other Dragon-type Pokemon for super effective damage without losing stats or having a chance to miss. However, Ice Beam is a lot weaker and leaves no real option to heavily damage foes neutral to Dragon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment, a Timid nature, and Choice Scarf allow Goodra to Speed tie with other Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Gardevoir as well as outpace the entire unboosted metagame bar Mega Sceptile. Sap Sipper gives Goodra an immunity to Grass-type moves, allowing it to switch into Grass-types like Shaymin more easily. A Hasty nature alternatively allows Goodra to keep maximum Speed and some Attack in order to make use of Earthquake better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goodra should primarily be used as a revenge killer, having the Speed and moveset to take on Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Noivern, Salazzle, and Zygarde-10%. Make sure to use Fire Blast when predicting Steel-type Pokemon that wish to take advantage of Draco Meteor. If the opponent has a Florges or Registeel, try to predict what moves to use or what switches to make in order to not waste turns dealing little damage. Even though Goodra is offensive, it can still soft check Pokemon such as Roserade and Salazzle. Try to make use of Goodra's bulk and typing to check Pokemon as well as revenge killing. Be aware of status and entry hazards when using Goodra, as it has no reliable recovery. Too much damage over time leaves Goodra open to priority users such as Golisopod, Zygarde-10%, and Honchkrow. Watch out for locking into the wrong move, like Thunderbolt against a team with Dragon Dance Zygarde-10%.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Goodra has the ability to revenge kill and force switches, so entry hazards are good because they cause chip damage to the opponent's checks. Registeel, Metagross, Roserade, and Nidoqueen work especially well, as they also cover Goodra's Fairy-type weakness. Water-types are very good alongside Goodra thanks to its Electric resistance and ability to check Grass-type Pokemon with Sap Sipper. Mega Blastoise and Golisopod work very well with Goodra offensively, whereas Milotic and Slowbro work well defensively and also cover Goodra's weakness to physical attackers. Steel-type Pokemon such as Registeel, Metagross, Bronzong, and Escavalier can switch into Gardevoir and Florges, which check Goodra. Poison-type Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Salazzle are also very good checks to Florges. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Gardevoir help to remove threats to Goodra like Noivern, Flygon, and Zygarde-10%. Florges and Gardevoir also have the ability to keep Goodra healthy with Wish, Heal Bell, and Healing Wish.

    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10% is blessed with Thousand Arrows, a move widely regarded as the best offensive move in the game, making it a premier offensive threat in RarelyUsed. Zygarde-10% has a great STAB combination that allows it to pressure the almost omnipresent Steel-types of the tier while also hitting Pokemon resistant to Ground with Outrage. Zygarde-10%'s Speed tier lets it outpace most of the tier, including the likes of Virizion, Espeon, and Mismagius. Although its immediate power is rather low when compared to other Ground-types such as Rhyperior or even Donphan, Zygarde-10% can fix this with Dragon Dance and Dragonium Z, working wonders as a fast cleaner, or with a Choice Band, offering raw power to wallbreak. However, Zygarde-10% struggles to break past defensive Pokemon like Porygon2, Slowbro, and Cresselia, which have no problem switching into its attacks and forcing it out. It is also held back by its lackluster bulk, meaning it can only switch into or set up on some resisted moves and more passive Pokemon, such as Registeel. It is also very vulnerable to priority users if not locked into Extreme Speed, especially against those with Ice Shard. Having only Outrage as a reliable Dragon-type STAB move also makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Steel- or Fairy-type Pokemon, so it has to choose wisely when to use the attack.</p>",

Outrage is a secondary STAB move against Pokemon that resist Thousand Arrows, such as Shaymin, Virizion, and Golisopod. When paired with Dragonium Z, it can become a powerful nuke to take down defensive behemoths like Milotic, Cresselia, and Slowbro after a boost and some chip damage. Extreme Speed can pick off weakened foes when unboosted and is an option to deal with even faster Pokemon at +1 like Choice Scarf Salazzle and Noivern while also being in a higher priority bracket than other priority moves, such as Golisopod's First Impression and Honchkrow's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragonium Z improves Zygarde-10%'s potential as a cleaner, having great power to deal with most checks after a boost. A Jolly nature with maximum EVs in Attack and Speed is preferred to outspeed the likes of Virizion and Lycanroc when unboosted, but Adamant can be a good option to increase Zygarde-10%'s damage output while still leaving it able to outspeed threats such as Shaymin and Ninetales. Examples of notable KOs that can be reached with an Adamant nature include a guaranteed OHKO against Milotic and Umbreon and a 50% chance to OHKO Donphan after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When dealing with the likes of Milotic or Mandibuzz, Devastating Drake must be used carefully, as the opponent might switch out to another weakened Pokemon to waste its use. Be sure to remove Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon before locking Zygarde-10% into Outrage, as they can take advantage of it in that state. Try to find setup opportunities against Pokemon that get forced out or can't do much against Zygarde-10%. Be it after sacking another Pokemon or making use of pivoting, Zygarde-10% can be sent out against the likes of Drapion, Arcanine, or Ninetales to set up on a forced switch. Avoid switching Zygarde-10% directly into opposing attacks, since the chip damage will make setting up much more difficult. Ideally, Zygarde-10% might be preserved to set up in late-game situations, unless it needs to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zygarde-10% works great with entry hazard support, especially in the form of Spikes. Roserade, Golisopod, and Accelgor can offer great offensive synergy while stacking Spikes on the field. Knock Off users such as Pangoro, Drapion, and Escavalier are great offensive partners to Zygarde-10%, since they can remove items such as Porygon2's Eviolite and Milotic's Leftovers and weaken checks such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and Uxie, while Zygarde-10% can force out Pokemon like Ninetales and Arcanine. In more offensive teams, dual screens support from Meowstic-M, Uxie, and Electrode can make Zygarde-10%'s setup much easier while also protecting it from most priority moves. Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Forretress can cover Zygarde-10%'s weaknesses to Ice- and Dragon-type moves while offering hazard support and general defensive utility. Escavalier and Metagross can cover those weaknesses and provide offensive presence and wallbreaking power alongside hazard setting.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thousand Arrows deals great damage to most neutral targets and forces out offensive threats such as Raikou, Drapion, and Houndoom. Outrage is Zygarde-10%'s secondary STAB move, allowing it to 2HKO most Pokemon that resist Thousand Arrows. Examples include Shaymin, Virizion, and Araquanid. Extreme Speed is a reliable revenge killing measure against faster threats like Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Noivern, weakened Donphan, and Salazzle after prior damage. Toxic is a utility move that allows Zygarde-10% to cripple defensive Pokemon, such as Cresselia, Slowbro, and Tangela, putting them on a timer every time they switch into it. Earthquake's greater damage output, however, can guarantee a 2HKO against Mega Blastoise and offer more damage against various threats without getting locked into Outrage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band greatly increases Zygarde-10%'s raw power and damage output. A Jolly nature with maximum Attack and Speed investment is needed to outspeed threats such as Virizion and Lycanroc-D. You can run an Adamant nature so that Zygarde-10% can 2HKO Slowbro, Uxie, and Porygon2 with Outrage after Stealth Rock but Adamant fails to outpace Pokemon such as the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, Zygarde-10% will use Thousand Arrows due to its great capability of hitting most Pokemon on the tier. Outrage is a great tool to break opposing Pokemon that resist Thousand Arrows such as Shaymin, which can allow Zygarde-10%'s teammates to win the game later on as they are removed from the opposing team. However, be aware of Steel- and Fairy-types that can come into Outrage and knock it out. Against faster Pokemon and setup sweepers, Zygarde-10%'s partners must get these Pokemon weakened enough so Zygarde-10% can revenge kill them or clean with Extreme Speed. Toxic is a great way to give Zygarde-10%'s walls a hard time, since the likes of Slowbro and Cresselia will be forced to recover way more often. Zygarde-10% must be aware of which move it locks itself into, as it can be taken advantage of by opposing Pokemon, especially those that usually carry Protect, such as Bronzong and Registeel.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types like Machamp, Pangoro, and Toxicroak can be great partners to Zygarde-10% due to their access to Knock Off and Ice-type coverage, which allows them to take on common defensive roadblocks such as Tangela, Cresselia, and Donphan. Drapion is a great partner to Zygarde-10%, as it can trap most Psychic-types with a Choice Band set, such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Uxie, and beat other checks such as Donphan, Porygon2, and Tangela with its Swords Dance + Waterium Z set. Raikou, Swellow, and Yanmega can offer wallbreaking power and utility with Volt Switch and U-turn, as they can pivot Zygarde-10% in safely against their own checks and counters, such as Registeel, Tyrantrum, and Bronzong. Mega Abomasnow and Vanilluxe greatly appreciate Zygarde-10%'s ability to take out Steel-types, while they can reliably beat Slowbro and Milotic. Setup sweepers such as Barbaracle and Cloyster are great alongside Zygarde-10%, as it can weaken common defensive Pokemon so they can clean the game later on. Roserade, Forretress, and Accelgor can set up Spikes on the field, which makes Zygarde-10%’s work easier due to the chip damage its checks take every time they come into the field while Spikes are up.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Diancie is an interesting defensive Pokemon in the tier that compresses Stealth Rock with the ability to check Noivern, Arcanine, Goodra, Mega Ampharos, Swellow, and Houndoom thanks to its typing and mixed bulk. Diancie also has an easy time setting up entry hazards against a handful of the tier's removers such as Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, and Sigilyph. However, Diancie is completely hopeless against Steel-types like Metagross, Registeel, and Bronzong due to their resistance to its primary attacks alongside their immunity to Toxic, although Earth Power somewhat mitigates this flaw. Diancie also invites some of the most dangerous offensive Pokemon in the metagame like Zygarde-10%, Shaymin, Roserade, and Virizion in due to its typing. Diancie's lack of reliable recovery can also leave it worn down quickly throughout the match, and it can be chipped down by Stealth Rock and Spikes and crippled by poison and burns. Diancie faces competition from other defensive Rock-types like Rhyperior and Gigalith, which both have essential tools to pressure out Steel-types and can also check Salazzle as opposed to Diancie, but Diancie's higher Special Defense and part-Fairy-typing, which allow it to be a more reliable answer to Houndoom and other special attackers, can set it apart.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Power Gem can be used to defeat Pokemon such as Sigilyph, but is generally a worse coverage option than Earth Power. Diamond Storm paired with a Sassy nature gives Diancie a stronger attack that can also boost its Defense to toughen it up against physical attackers like Toxicroak and Drapion, but its lower accuracy and low PP compared to Power Gem can be detrimental in long, drawn-out games. Diancie could attempt at sweeping with a Calm Mind + Groundium Z set to bust through Metagross and Registeel, but this set needs to invest into its offensive stats, which makes it less effective defensively. This set is also outclassed by other Calm Mind users like Slowbro, Necrozma, and Raikou. Diancie can stall out foes with Protect and Toxic, but this removes coverage that Diancie often wants for checking Flying- and Fire-types. Shuca Berry is useful on more offensive teams, as Diancie can lure in Nidoqueen and Zygarde-10% and retaliate, but this item is difficult to justify over Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross and Escavalier destroy Diancie with their STAB moves. Metagross needs to be wary of Diancie's Earth Power, however. Defensive Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel completely wall Diancie as well, although the latter fears the rare Calm Mind + Groundium Z set.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Roserade, Shaymin, and Virizion can offensively pressure Diancie with super effective damage, although the latter should be wary of Moonblast. Tsareena can also remove Diancie's entry hazards while pressuring it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Golisopod and Barbaracle are offensive answers to Diancie, while Milotic and Slowbro take a Defensive approach, with the former taking advantage of Toxic by virtue of Marvel Scale.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Donphan can spin away Diancie's entry hazards, while Nidoqueen completely walls any set that isn't using Earth Power. Zygarde-10% and Flygon can revenge kill Diancie after it's chipped, although these two should scout for a potential Shuca Berry.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Diancie's main attack and is also important for fishing for Special Attack drops against the likes of Dragalge, Mismagius, and Necrozma. Earth Power offers the coverage to damage Nidoqueen, Metagross, and Houndoom super effectively. Toxic can be essential to crippling walls like Slowbro and Cresselia, but Heal Bell is an alternative if the team could use a cleric.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Calm nature boosts Diancie's Special Defense without compromising its power. Clear Body is Diancie's only ability but does have some use in preventing random stat drops from Psychic and Bug Buzz. Normalium Z can be used in tandem with Heal Bell to offer Diancie a one-time full recovery, making it more useful in matches against faster teams; however, Leftovers is generally more consistent and does not take up a Z slot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diancie should set up Stealth Rock as early as possible to deal chip damage and soften up any checks. Diancie should also often be switched in against foes it checks such as Noivern, Goodra, Arcanine, and Houndoom if it's healthy enough in order to stomach their attacks and potentially set up Stealth Rock. Spreading Toxic is not a bad strategy to help wear down defensive switch-ins like Donphan and Slowbro when Stealth Rock is already on the field in order to cripple the opposition and offer its teammates complementary chip damage to soften up the opponent's defenses. Diancie should avoid status if it isn't running Heal Bell, as it greatly hinders its longevity in the match. Diancie will often invite Steel-types, so aggressive doubles to bring in Fire- or Ground-types that prey on these Pokemon or possibly scouting and chipping with Earth Power can work.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diancie fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that require role compression to round out the rest of the team. Roserade, Virizion, and Shaymin are all offensive Grass-types that greatly appreciate Diancie’s ability to check Fire- and Flying-types. Ground- and Fire-types such as Zygarde-10%, Donphan, Salazzle, Arcanine, and Houndoom can offensively pressure the Steel-types that Diancie struggles with. Slowbro forms a strong defensive core with Diancie due to it checking Zygarde-10% and other Ground-types and its high Defense that complements Diancie's Special Defense. Entry hazards can chip Diancie fairly quickly if they're stacked up, so removal from Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, and Tsareena can be essential to keeping Diancie healthy.</p>"

Unfortunately, its Speed and Defense are incredibly lacking, which allows it to be revenge killed and Pursuit trapped easily by Pokemon such as Golisopod, Zygarde-10%, and Drapion. Hoopa's defensive typing also leaves it extremely vulnerable to Pokemon with Dark-type coverage moves like Donphan and Mega Blastoise, which makes it a terrible spinblocker.

  "Ribombee": {
    "overview": "<p>Ribombee can be a passable option as a fast special attacker thanks to its high Speed tier and good coverage. It can revenge kill an assortment of offensive threats, including Choice Band Zygarde-10%, Nasty Plot Salazzle, Noivern, and Virizion, and has Quiver Dance to beat Choice Scarf users that would otherwise revenge kill it. Ribombee also has a few appealing support options in Sticky Web, Tailwind, and Defog, which could potentially fill holes in a team. Unfortunately, several large weaknesses prevent Ribombee from being very common in the metagame. While Bug / Fairy isn't a terrible defensive typing, Ribombee's absurd frailty means it can only switch into passive walls and weak resisted hits. Anything remotely strong, even resisted, will likely 2HKO it. While fast, it still is outsped by every relevant Choice Scarf user when unboosted, and most of them will OHKO it as long as Stealth Rock is up. Priority users such as Machamp and Zygarde-10% can also prove troublesome. Having average Special Attack for a sweeper forces Ribombee to use its Z-Move to revenge kill prominent threats like Virizion, leaving it depleted for potential future sweeps. Finally, common special tanks on bulky teams like Registeel, Snorlax, and Bronzong can weather even boosted attacks, making Ribombee struggle to successfully dent holes in such teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Sticky Web lead set with Focus Sash is usable, but Sticky Web offense is too unreliable for this set to warrant much attention. Tailwind can give wallbreakers a couple turns to wreak havoc. Defog can be used if you desperately need hazard removal and can't fit it anywhere else, but Ribombee is horrible at removing because of its Stealth Rock weakness and inability to adequately threaten most hazard users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types easily punish Ribombee for attempting to sweep too early and can come in on most of its coverage options. Alolan Marowak and Arcanine get chances to fire off powerful attacks while Ninetales can set up Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types wall Ribombee's STAB moves, with most also having the bulk to take boosted Bug Buzz or Hidden Power Fire comfortably. Bronzong and Registeel can do so while retaliating with STAB attacks or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Ribombee's average Special Attack means that walls such as Snorlax and Porygon2 will take its hits easily and be free to either attack it or use Toxic and stall it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While it has an amazing natural Speed tier, Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir, Roserade, and Salazzle can revenge kill any unboosted Ribombee, and priority users like Zygarde-10%, Medicham, Pangoro, and Golisopod will beat it regardless with a little chip damage.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is great for pivoting out of some sturdier Fairy-type answers such as Registeel. Although Sticky Web on a Choice Specs set may seem odd, it's great for slowing down opposing teams, and Ribombee's offensive presence yields plenty of opportunities to set it up. Psychic improves Ribombee's ability to act as a revenge killer, letting it remove Pokemon like Salazzle. It also lets Ribombee hit Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Roserade. Sticky Web or Psychic can be dropped for Hidden Power Fire, which allows Ribombee to remove weakened Steel-types. However, Bug Buzz already hits Steel-types such as Bronzong and Metagross, so Hidden Power Fire is commonly inefficient.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature allows Ribombee to outpace Pokemon like Noivern, Zygarde-10%, and Raikou. Shield Dust lets Ribombee avoid secondary effects such as burn from Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Ribombee's defensive typing to pivot into and check attackers such as Synthesis Virizion, Zygarde-10%, Shaymin, and weakened Mega Blastoise. However, give such threats as few turns as possible, as Ribombee's lackluster bulk prevents it from switching in more than one or two times. Ribombee's somewhat lackluster Special Attack prevents it from being able to make headway against Pokemon such as Registeel, Milotic, and Porygon2. So, instead of attacking them, use U-turn on the switch in to gain momentum and give free turns to teammates. Set up Sticky Web on forced switches to support slower teammates. For example, if up against a Pokemon such as Virizion or Tsareena, take advantage of the free turn by setting up Sticky Web. However, use Sticky Web with caution to avoid giving opposing setup sweepers like Barbaracle free turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Ribombee is best used on bulky offense teams that really appreciate its defensive typing allowing it to be a one- or two-time switch-in to some of the tier's bigger threats, mainly Zygarde-10%, Virizion lacking Stone Edge, and Shaymin. Slow, powerful wallbreakers such as Guts Machamp, Choice Band Tyrantrum, and Pangoro appreciate Ribombee's ability to give them free turns through U-turn and, especially, Sticky Web, which lets them outpace checks such as Mega Blastoise. They also break down many of Ribombee's checks and counters, making it much easier to clean up late-game with Ribombee. Sticky Web is also fantastic support for setup sweepers, as it allows teammates like Virizion to beat Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Shaymin and Rock Polish Tyrantrum to outpace Choice Scarf Salazzle. Tyrantrum also makes use of Ribombee's weakness to Fire- and Poison-types to set up.</p>"
      },
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance allows Ribombee to boost its Special Attack and Speed to high levels and buff its Special Defense to something respectable. Moonblast is Ribombee's strongest STAB move, possessing strong neutral coverage. Psychic prevents common Poison-types such as Nidoqueen and Salazzle from walling Ribombee. Bug Buzz is used as a strong STAB option and to hit threats like Shaymin, Cresselia, Metagross, and Bronzong harder. Hidden Power Fire can be used instead to hits the numerous Steel-types in RU that resist Bug Buzz, including Escavalier, Klinklang, and Forretress.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs let Ribombee hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow unboosted Ribombee to outspeed threats like Noivern and Zygarde-10%, and even the fastest Choice Scarf users like Salazzle after a boost. Fairium Z lets Ribombee break through some naturally bulky Fairy-neutral checks like Gardevoir and Diancie. Shield Dust prevents secondary effects from attacks that Ribombee might tank while boosting like Milotic's Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Remove priority users such as Arcanine, Zygarde-10%, Golisopod, Medicham, and Mega Glalie before attempting to boost, as they can quickly cut a sweep short. Try to preserve Ribombee's health early-game so that it has a better chance to survive a hit when it needs to boost. You should avoid bringing it in with direct switches, but you can still use this set to revenge kill if necessary. Weakening Ribombee's checks and counters to the point where Twinkle Tackle can KO them will allow you to sweep more easily. Keeping entry hazards away for Ribombee allows it to revenge kill early- and mid-game without removing its ability to sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior can both threaten Steel-types and keep Stealth Rock on the field to increase Ribombee's chance of sweeping. Fighting-types such as Medicham, Virizion, and Bewear can break holes in special tanks like Snorlax, Registeel, and Porygon2, creating chances for Ribombee to sweep the rest of your opponent's team. Roserade and Gardevoir are interesting teammate options on hyper offense teams, as with Sleep Powder and Memento they can give Ribombee chances to set up freely. Mega Blastoise synergizes very well with Ribombee, providing both good coverage and hazard removal. Pursuit trappers like Drapion and Sneasel can remove troublesome Ribombee checks like Bronzong and Alolan Marowak.</p>"

Lycanroc-D also has unique access to Rock-type priority in Accelerock, which lets it revenge kill the likes of Swellow and Salazzle. It can also run Sucker Punch to hit the likes of Choice Scarf Flygon, Choice Scarf Medicham, and Zygarde-10% neutrally. Unfortunately, Lycanroc-D relies on low-Base Power moves such as Fire Fang and Drill Run to break through some of its checks that need to be weakened before it is able to sweep. Due to its poor bulk, it doesn't offer much defensive utility, being unable to set up properly even against Fire-type Pokemon such as Ninetales, which Lycanroc-D can't take despite resisting them, due to their additional coverage. Lycanroc-D also cannot set up against some of the most relevant defensive Pokemon in the tier, including Shuca Berry Metagross, Milotic, and Foul Play Mandibuzz. Another problem is the amount of support Lycanroc-D needs to work; although it can be very strong after a Swords Dance, it usually cannot set up properly without taking a big hit, needing support from pivoting, dual screens, or Memento to set up safely and stay healthy.</p>",

Stone Edge is Lycanroc-D's main STAB move, 2HKOing the likes of Milotic, Bewear, and Cresselia after a Swords Dance boost when boosted by a Life Orb. It also can turn into Splintered Stormshards when Lycanroc-D is holding a Lycanium Z, which allows it to OHKO them right away after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Fang lets Lycanroc-D deal with Bronzong after a Swords Dance boost while also doing good damage to Bewear. Drill Run is an option over Fire Fang to guarantee an OHKO on Pokemon such as Registeel and Nidoqueen while also offering greater damage against the likes of Rhyperior and non Shuca Berry Metagross. Sucker Punch is Lycanroc-D's main form of priority, allowing it to OHKO Choice Scarf Flygon, Gardevoir, and Zygarde-10% after a boost. Accelerock is a STAB priority option that allows Lycanroc-D to beat Noivern when unboosted after Stealth Rock damage as well as deal with Salazzle and Swellow better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and Attack with a Jolly nature lets Lycanroc-D be as fast and as powerful as it can. A Life Orb is the main item option to increase Lycanroc-D's power, which allows Sucker Punch and Accelerock to achieve essential KOs, such as unboosted Accelerock KOing Noivern after Stealth Rock, unboosted Accelerock OHKOing Salazzle, and boosted Sucker Punch OHKOing the likes of Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Zygarde-10%. Lycanium Z is an option to beat the likes of Milotic, Cresselia, Bewear, and Bronzong with Splintered Stormshards after some chip damage. Tough Claws is Lycanroc-D's only ability and is essential to Fire Fang and Sucker Punch's power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid being statused by the likes of Porygon2's Thunder Wave and Choice Scarf Gardevoir’s Will-O-Wisp, since they cripple Lycanroc-D and its ability to fire off Life Orb-boosted attacks. Use Swords Dance on forced switches against foes like Ninetales and Salazzle. Despite Lycanroc-D's poor bulk, it can still set up freely against Pokemon like Noivern and Salazzle. Before sending Lycanroc-D in to sweep, make sure to weaken some of its switch-ins, such as Rhyperior, Steelix, and Bewear.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivoting is essential with Lycanroc-D, since it has problems switching into virtually anything. U-turn or Volt Switch support from the likes of Uxie, Flygon, Raikou, and Mega Ampharos is very appreciated.

Wallbreakers such as Ninetales, Bewear, and Zygarde-10% make Lycanroc-D's life easier, since they can weaken Lycanroc-D's checks so it can clean up later in the game. Pokemon that resist Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves are essential when running Lycanroc-D. Shaymin, Virizion, and TauntTox Mandibuzz are good options that can help break cores and offer utility options. It's nice to pair Lycanroc-D with offensive Pokemon that take advantage of some of the defensive threats that Lycanroc-D can break through, such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Tyrantrum, and Zygarde-10%. Support like dual screens from Uxie and Meowstic and Spikes from Mega Glalie and Roserade is appreciated, as it allows Lycanroc-D to set up more safely and wear down its checks.</p>"

  "Araquanid": {
    "overview": "<p>Araquanid stands out as one of the most viable setters of Sticky Web thanks to its offensive presence and matchup against key entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Xatu. A great ability in Water Bubble, a solid Special Defense stat, and resistances to key types in the tier such as Ground, Fighting, and Water also make it capable of handling common threats in the metagame such as Nidoqueen, Slowbro, and Houndoom. However, Araquanid is quite slow and has pitiful physical bulk. A weakness to Stealth Rock also hampers its longevity by quite a bit. Its non-Water-type moves are not very powerful, and thus its movepool contains very few viable attacking options. Lastly, it faces competition as a Sticky Web setter from Ribombee and Galvantula, which are much faster and have similar offensive presence, and the former can also beat other entry hazard removers such as Tsareena that Araquanid has trouble with. Their higher Speed stats also help them fare a bit better against Mega Blastoise.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set utilizing Spider Web / Liquidation / Leech Life or Toxic / Rest with a Splash Plate or Metronome can be useful, as it can safely remove certain defensive threats in the tier such as Slowbro, Milotic, and Tangela from the match to clear the way for teammates. However, this set isn't popular because one of its main targets, Milotic, is not common enough to justify using and Substitute + Toxic can already handle most of its other targets. More offensive sets without Sticky Web, such as a Choice Band set, can seem like good options considering the power of Araquanid's STAB Liquidation, but these sets are often outclassed by Golisopod, which has access to priority moves and stronger non-Water-type moves. These sets also have trouble breaking through bulky Pokemon that resist Water.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Noivern, Shaymin, and Virizion can usually take a hit from Araquanid and hit back hard, with Noivern OHKOing it occasionally. More niche Water-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Milotic and Seismitoad can also work well, with the former even having Refresh to nullify Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Toxicroak, and Bewear prey on Araquanid's poor physical bulk and usually don't take much from any of its moves. Notably, Toxicroak is immune to Araquanid's Water-type STAB moves thanks to Dry Skin, resists Leech Life, and is unaffected by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Noivern, Yanmega, and Swellow, while unable to switch into Araquanid, can easily revenge kill it with strong STAB moves. Mantine is a more defensive option that is also immune to Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Raikou outspeeds Araquanid and can OHKO it with Stealth Rock up; it can 2HKO Araquanid otherwise. Mega Ampharos is a more niche option but also resists Araquanid's Liquidation and doesn't even need Stealth Rock to OHKO Araquanid.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock can wear down Araquanid quickly due to its lack of reliable recovery and weakness to the latter. While it's immune to burns, it is very much vulnerable to Toxic because of said lack of recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Araquanid makes for a good setter of Sticky Web thanks to its good power and solid defensive attributes. Liquidation is a strong STAB move capable of easily 2HKOing common entry hazard removers such as Donphan and Sigilyph. Magic Coat is capable of bouncing back status moves that can disrupt Araquanid and its team, particularly Taunt. Mirror Coat is used in the last slot to take advantage of Araquanid's naturally good special bulk and to beat Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Water Bubble boosts the power of Liquidation. Splash Plate complements this, giving Araquanid a significant offensive presence. An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment increase Araquanid's damage output further still. Maximum Speed investment allows Araquanid to outspeed defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Vaporeon. Once Sticky Web is up, it can also outspeed Florges.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sticky Web should be set when the foe switches out, the opponent's entry hazard remover has fainted, or the current matchup is generally in Araquanid's favor. The threat of Liquidation can also be used to pressure the opponent into giving Araquanid chances to set up Sticky Web. Unlike other setters of Sticky Web such as Ribombee and Galvantula, Araquanid can more easily set it up again if it had been removed earlier in the match thanks to its bulk. Said bulk also allows Araquanid can to switch into entry hazard removers in the tier such as Mega Blastoise and Donphan, and while Knock Off from the latter can do quite a bit of damage to Araquanid, it resists Earthquake and Ice Shard. Magic Coat is best utilized when you predict the opposing Pokemon will use a status move, particularly Stealth Rock from Pokemon like Registeel and Metagross, and Toxic from the likes of Mandibuzz. Mirror Coat is best utilized against special attackers such as Ribombee, Salazzle, and especially Mega Blastoise, which can be 2HKOed by its own reflected Dark Pulse.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow but powerful wallbreakers such as Tyrantrum, Honchkrow, Bewear, and Machamp heavily benefit from the Speed drops that Sticky Web gives to the opponent's team. To make Rapid Spin usage a bit more difficult, spinblockers such as Mismagius can be utilized as partners to this Araquanid set. Similarly, Pokemon capable of handling common Defog users such as Passimian and Taunt users such as Honchkrow and Mismagius are good partners to this Araquanid set. Additional entry hazard setters such as Roserade and Metagross can complement both Araquanid and other teammates by giving them additional wallbreaking power. These two Pokemon also benefit a lot from Sticky Web.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Toxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The combination of Substitute and Toxic allows Araquanid to effectively stall out common threats such as Slowbro, Mega Blastoise, and Mandibuzz. Liquidation serves as a strong STAB move backed by Araquanid's Water Bubble ability and is capable of hitting a wide range of Pokemon in the RU metagame neutrally. Leech Life is mainly used to hit Grass-types such as Shaymin, Tangela, and Mega Sceptile; the health recovery from the move is a bonus. Protect can be used over Leech Life to gain free Toxic damage and Leftovers recovery for a turn. However, this tends to leave Araquanid walled by Grass-types as a result.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>68 EVs in Speed allow Araquanid to outspeed Pokemon with base 50 Speed such as Registeel and Donphan. Maximum Attack investment makes Araquanid hit as hard as possible. Leftovers offsets the health reduction Substitute provides over time, and 188 HP EVs allow it to regain more health from Leftovers. It also works well alongside Leech Life to provide additional healing capability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Substitute when you expect a bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro or Mandibuzz to come into play, and then use Toxic to attempt to outstall them. Araquanid's typing should be utilized for opportunities to switch in on Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Bronzong, and Mega Blastoise. Liquidation's higher power via Water Bubble and better coverage mean that it is usually the more reliable attacking move over Leech Life. When the Pokemon you are trying to outstall resists Liquidation, you should use Toxic instead to apply better pressure. If Protect is used in the last slot, use it when you expect the foe to break Araquanid's Substitute, or as a way to scout for potential moves that may threaten Araquanid.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon such as Metagross, Machamp, and Houndoom appreciate Araquanid's ability to wear down bulky threats such as Slowbro and Mandibuzz. Cleaners such as Zygarde-10%, Salazzle, and Swellow can take advantage of Araquanid's ability to open holes in the opponent's team. More physically defensive Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Slowbro, and Forretress can help out with Araquanid's weakness to strong physical moves. Lastly, entry hazard removers such as Sigilyph, Donphan, and Tsareena help with Araquanid's vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes, allowing it to set up more Substitutes throughout a match.</p>"

  "Salazzle": {
    "overview": "<p>In a sea of lower-tier Fire-types, Salazzle stands out as one of the most lethal among them and one of the most powerful RU Pokemon. Its excellent STAB combination, great Speed, and access to Nasty Plot give it the means to pose as a threatening sweeper to every playstyle, and its great typing makes up for its minuscule defenses by granting it crucial 4x resistances and a Toxic immunity, which allow it to set up on Pokemon like Florges, Roserade, Registeel, and single-attack or Choice-locked Escavalier. Salazzle's defensive typing serves other purposes as well by diluting the threat of Toxic Spikes and letting it serve as an offensive check to Chlorophyll Venusaur and Synthesis Virizion. Salazzle is also a notable user of Z-Moves, using its Acid Downpour to its fullest by melting through a slew of tenacious specially defensive Pokemon such as Snorlax, Diancie, Milotic, and Cresselia with minimal support. Salazzle's frailty and Stealth Rock weakness result in it being a tad too easy to revenge kill with priority such as Sucker Punch or any ordinary Choice Scarf user, however. Salazzle's lack of bulk also restricts setup opportunities to forced switches and specific targets, and even then, due to Salazzle's limited coverage options, it requires additional support to break through the likes of Gigalith.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Pulse allows Nasty Plot Salazzle to get more damage on Goodra and Dragalge but is otherwise not as useful as Hidden Power Ice. Knock Off can be used as Nasty Plot's fourth move so that Salazzle can cripple its defensive checks prior to setting up. Knock Off can also cripple potential switch-ins like Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, giving Salazzle an easier time sweeping late-game. Encore can enable setup versus entry hazard setters and removers, ease Sucker Punch mind games, and turn the tables on opposing setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Raikou, but it is not particularly reliable. Substitute can be used to dodge Sucker Punch, evade Thunder Wave, and make Salazzle harder to revenge kill, but losing coverage makes Salazzle much easier to counter. Toxic + Hidden Power Ice can be run in the last two slots on Salazzle's Choice Scarf set to hit threats like Flygon for more damage as well as cripple switch-ins like Porygon2 and Mandibuzz, but should only be run if Barbaracle is covered well by Salazzle's teammates.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gigalith</strong>: Gigalith is by far Salazzle's best counter due to its incredible special bulk and lack of exploitative weaknesses. Gigalith is capable of taking hits from a +2 Salazzle and KOing it back while almost always outlasting it due to its ability to set sand and Stealth Rock up to wear Salazzle down quickly.</p> <p><strong>STAB-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Dragalge, Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Flygon, and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum resist Salazzle's Poison-type attacks and are capable of revenge killing it in the case of Tyrantrum, Aerodactyl, and Flygon or defensively checking it in the case of Dragalge.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Cresselia, Porygon2, Snorlax, and Assault Vest Slowking are all capable of taking a hit from full health and dealing massive damage back or outright crippling Salazzle, although prior chip damage can allow Salazzle to muscle through them with +2 Acid Downpour.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users and Faster Pokemon</strong>: Priority users such as Golisopod, Arcanine, and Honchkrow are capable of picking Salazzle off with their respective priority moves, whereas faster Pokemon such as Swellow, Noivern, weather sweepers, and just about any Choice Scarf user revenge kill Salazzle with ease.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot gives Salazzle the necessary power to break through a variety of walls, including Umbreon and Porygon2. Fire Blast complements Sludge Wave well and is used to KO Registeel at +2. Sludge Wave targets Water- and Dragon-types. Hidden Power Grass keeps Rhyperior, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon from checking Salazzle. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative that KOes Flygon and Zygarde-10% as well as pressuring Dragalge, but the former two can beat Salazzle through Choice Scarf or Extreme Speed anyway. Using Taunt is another option that allows Salazzle to shut down passive Thunder Wave users and Pyukumuku.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Poisonium Z is by far Salazzle's best item, as +2 Acid Downpour allows it to OHKO Diancie, Mega Blastoise, and Milotic as well as Snorlax and Cresselia after two switches into Stealth Rock. In addition, Poisonium Z allows Salazzle to more safely set up on passive Knock Off users and gives it the means to break through Prankster Encore. Life Orb can be used if another Z-Move user is more important to your team, and the initial power makes Salazzle's job as a revenge killer a bit easier, but Poisonium Z should always be the first choice due to the significance of the KOs it gets.</p> <p>The 8 HP EVs prevent Salazzle from being 3HKOed by Umbreon's Foul Play. Oblivious is the more useful ability, as it allows Salazzle to safely set up against Taunt users, and Corrosion simply isn't useful when Salazzle can only inflict poison 10% of the time with Sludge Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>There are only a few offensive Pokemon that Salazzle sets up on, but several Grass-types and defensive Pokemon, including Florges, Roserade, Registeel, and Umbreon, are easy enough to take advantage of. Aside from these Pokemon, Salazzle can be used to revenge kill threats such as Escavalier, Virizion, and Shaymin or even set up on them if a switch is anticipated. Salazzle should only be brought in when a teammate faints to revenge kill or if it's given the proper support with Volt Switch or U-turn users such as Mega Ampharos and Noivern.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog support from the likes of Mandibuzz is imperative, as Salazzle being at full health allows it to withstand many important attacks it otherwise wouldn't, including Cresselia's Psychic and two of Porygon2's Thunderbolt. Rapid Spin users such as Mega Blastoise and Donphan can provide similar support and work better on offensive teams, but aren't as consistent as Defoggers with reliable recovery. Pivots such as Noivern can use U-turn to bring Salazzle in against Pokemon it sets up on.</p> <p>Choice Specs Gardevoir and Salazzle share answers in Cresselia and Gigalith, so they can soften up each other's checks. Swellow, Honchkrow, and Yanmega share checks with Salazzle and can make good partners, since Salazzle and any one of the three can wear down these counters for one of them to sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Salazzle's main STAB move, allowing it to beat Pokemon such as Escavalier, Bewear, and Registeel and hit most Pokemon that don't resist Fire very hard. Sludge Wave allows Salazzle to hit Fairy-types and some Pokemon that are able to take Fire Blast, and it can be used if there's no need to risk a miss with Fire Blast. Hidden Power Grass allows Salazzle to KO Barbaracle and 2HKO specially defensive Rhyperior after Stealth Rock or slight chip damage. Dragon Pulse lets Salazzle hit other setup sweepers and switch-ins like Flygon and Dragalge. Hidden Power Ground is an option to revenge kill opposing Salazzle while still hitting Barbaracle hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Salazzle to outspeed and revenge kill a lot of threats, including Flygon, Venusaur, Swellow, Barbaracle, Noivern, and Cloyster. 252 EVs in Speed allow Salazzle to outspeed Pokemon such as +1 Zygarde-10% and +2 Naughty Cloyster, while 252 in Special Attack make Salazzle hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature is used to outspeed Modest Venusaur in sun, +2 Naive Cloyster, and +2 Barbaracle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Salazzle set should be used to revenge kill or to clean a game once its checks are weakened enough. Thanks to its Speed and great STAB combination, Choice Scarf Salazzle can revenge kill a lot of Pokemon most other Choice Scarf users can't such as Choice Scarf Flygon, Venusaur in sun, Choice Scarf Shaymin, +2 Barbaracle, and +2 Cloyster. While Salazzle can be brought in on resisted moves such as Florges's Moonblast, it usually doesn't want to take unnecessary damage; it should only come in through a free switch or slow U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is useful on offensive or balanced teams that need a check to Pokemon such as Shell Smash Cloyster and Rock Polish Tyrantrum. Defog and Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Donphan, and Mega Blastoise allows Salazzle to come in more often. Pokemon that can set entry hazards such as Golisopod and Registeel can be helpful, as they let Salazzle clean a game or revenge kill opposing Pokemon more easily. Strong wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Bewear, Life Orb Shaymin, and Choice Specs Gardevoir can help weaken Salazzle's checks to give it an easier time cleaning up, while Salazzle can help by weakening Registeel and Metagross, which can make it easier for those wallbreakers to spam their STAB moves.</p>"

  "Bewear": {
    "overview": "<p>Bewear differentiates itself from other Fighting-type wallbreakers with its defensive presence; its solid bulk combined with Fluffy allows Bewear to switch into physically offensive threats such as Golisopod, Tyrantrum, and Drapion. Bewear also sports an amazing Attack stat and a boosting option in Swords Dance to punch sizable holes in any Pokemon that doesn't resist its STAB combination. Unfortunately, Bewear's lacking Speed and Special Defense and Fluffy giving it an additional Fire-type weakness mean that it rarely gets the opportunity to sweep and invites in faster threats such as Salazzle, Mega Blastoise, and Necrozma. Bewear can also be worn down quickly by repeatedly switching into resisted attacks and entry hazards, Toxic damage, and recoil from Double-Edge. It can mitigate this somewhat by running Drain Punch, however. Despite its unique defensive traits, Bewear faces heavy competition from other Fighting-types in RU such as Machamp, Passimian, and Hariyama, as they all sport superior coverage options, Speed tiers, and Special Defense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up alongside Substitute and Leftovers can make Bewear more difficult to take down with physical attacks and can punish passive Pokemon like Bronzong and Registeel, but it loses out on the raw power of Swords Dance and a Z-Move. Taunt can also harass defensive Pokemon by preventing status and recovery, but it requires sacrificing a coverage move or Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Bewear's mediocre Speed and lacking Special Defense leave it vulnerable to getting revenge killed by Pokemon such as Salazzle, Noivern, Mega Blastoise, and Roserade. However, these Pokemon struggle to safely come in against Bewear.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulkier Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Cresselia are capable of pivoting into most, if not all, of Bewear's attacks safely, only taking notable damage from boosted Normal-type attacks. Gardevoir can use Trace to copy Fluffy, which allows it to switch into any attack other than Breakneck Blitz. Other Psychic-types like Necrozma, Sigilyph, and Espeon can threaten out Bewear easily and can attempt to pivot into Fighting-type moves, but they risk being KOed by other attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Although few and far between, Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Palossand, and Alolan Marowak can put Bewear in poor positions, as they can only be hit by weaker coverage options. They can also set up freely if Choice Band Bewear mistakenly locks itself into a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: If not running Drain Punch, Bewear is vulnerable to getting chipped down by entry hazards, Toxic, Double-Edge recoil, and resisted attacks from Pokemon like Golisopod, Lycanroc-D, and Metagross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Bewear's strongest Normal-type STAB attack, with recoil as its only drawback. Superpower scores easier KOs against Pokemon like Diancie, Bronzong, and Stealth Rock Metagross after a boost. Shadow Claw allows Bewear to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Palossand, and Alolan Marowak. Drain Punch is not as strong as Superpower, but it can let Bewear heal itself after taking damage from entry hazards, resisted attacks, or Double-Edge recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature gives Bewear the most wallbreaking power possible, but a Jolly nature can be used to outpace certain variants of Mantine and Metagross. Normalium Z powers up Double-Edge into Breakneck Blitz, which does not inflict recoil damage and allows Bewear to OHKO bulkier Pokemon like Cresselia, Slowbro, and Mandibuzz after a boost. Silk Scarf is a viable alternative if a Z-Crystal is being used elsewhere, as it gives Double-Edge more consistent power and can allow unboosted Double-Edge to potentially OHKO Florges after Stealth Rock damage. Fluffy is an excellent ability that eases setup while also allowing Bewear to actively check certain physical threats such as Barbaracle and Tyrantrum, although it leaves Bewear threatened out by most Fire-types like Salazzle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to Fluffy, Bewear can easily come in against physically offensive Pokemon like Barbaracle, Golisopod, and Rhyperior. It can also be brought in safely with the help of a pivot or after a teammate has fainted. Once in battle, Bewear can begin wallbreaking early- and mid-game or even sweep late-game, assuming all of its checks and counters have been dealt with. Fluffy can also allow Bewear to tank moves such as Virizion's Close Combat if needed, but don't let Bewear take too much damage if it is needed to check threats like Snorlax long-term. Bewear should begin setting up with Swords Dance after it has forced out the foe; then, it can threaten bulkier switch-ins such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Donphan with its Z-Move. However, if a more offensive check like Noivern, Gardevoir, or Nidoqueen is expected to switch in, attacking immediately, even with Breakneck Blitz, can heavily dent or KO these threats and make Bewear much harder to revenge kill. Ghost-types can switch into either STAB move with no issue, so predicting this play with Shadow Claw can open up Bewear to use its stronger STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Metagross, Registeel, and Rhyperior assists in many of Bewear's KOs, and these Pokemon can also alleviate Bewear's weakness to Fairy-, Flying-, and Fire-type Pokemon. Bewear can often struggle with Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Gardevoir, as they handle Superpower easily and can tank unboosted Normal-type moves, so partners such as Mismagius, Houndoom, and Drapion can assist Bewear by taking advantage of Psychic-types as well as Ghost-types. Houndoom and Drapion further assist Bewear with Pursuit. Pokemon like Shaymin and Ribombee can threaten physical sponges like Donphan and Tangela and bait in Registeel and certain Rock-types, which can give Bewear an opening to wallbreak. The former also provides Healing Wish support, which can give Bewear another chance to wallbreak if it has taken too much damage early-game. Bewear's vulnerability to many faster threats such as Salazzle, Noivern, and Mega Blastoise means that it appreciates partners such as Aerodactyl, Tyrantrum, and Mega Sceptile, which are capable of offensively checking such Pokemon. Cleaners like Zygarde-10% and Lycanroc-D are capable of capitalizing on Bewear's ability to wear down or remove Pokemon like Donphan and Golisopod. Pivots such as Flygon, Noivern, and Raikou can safely bring Bewear into battle so it can begin wallbreaking.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a fairly powerful Normal-type option with no drawbacks, but Double-Edge guarantees the 2HKO versus Slowbro and the OHKO against Florges and bulkier Noivern variants at the cost of inflicting recoil. Superpower is Bewear's strongest Fighting-type STAB option with the most reliable damage output, and the stat drops from using the move are often not a big hindrance, as Bewear is likely to switch out after getting a KO regardless. Shadow Claw enables Bewear to avoid getting walled by Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Alolan Marowak. Drain Punch gives Bewear a Fighting-type option that doesn't lower its stats, and it can also keep Bewear healthy in order to tank more hits. Facade can also be used to let Bewear be threatening even after a Scald burn, and it can punish bulkier foes for afflicting Bewear with Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature maximizes Bewear's damage output, with Jolly only being useful for outpacing a few Pokemon like Mantine and Jolly Pangoro. Choice Band gives Bewear great immediate power and capitalizes on its spammable STAB combination. Fluffy enables Bewear to check and threaten out more physical attackers, which lets it potentially punch a hole in the opposing team, but it does leave Bewear revenge killed more easily by Fire-types such as Salazzle and Houndoom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Bewear is capable of dealing great immediate damage without requiring a turn to set up, which can allow it to threaten Pokemon like Metagross and Machamp much more easily in order to get more chances to wallbreak. Bring Bewear into battle by switching into resisted hits such as Golisopod's First Impression, after a teammate has fainted, on a double switch, or with the help of a pivot. Avoiding certain attacks like Knock Off can allow Bewear to bluff a Swords Dance set more easily, often dissuading the use of Protect from Pokemon such as Registeel and Vaporeon, which can otherwise safely scout what move Bewear locks itself into. While Bewear's bulk alongside Fluffy can allow it to take a hit from Pokemon like Metagross and Machamp, it may need to stay healthy in order to switch into other threats such as Golisopod and Tyrantrum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from setters such as Necrozma, Roserade, and Forretress helps Bewear achieve various KOs. Necrozma and Roserade can also pressure certain physical walls such as opposing Forretress and Tangela, while Volt Switch from a partnering Forretress can get Bewear in safely. While Bewear can nail Psychic-types on the switch with Double-Edge, Pokemon capable of checking them like Golisopod and Houndoom are still appreciated, as Psychic-types can still pivot into Superpower and threaten Bewear if brought in safely. Pokemon such as Noivern and Dragalge can help check various threats to Bewear like Roserade and Salazzle while also drawing in Snorlax and Registeel, which creates an opening for Bewear to wallbreak. Dragalge is also able to absorb Toxic Spikes, which otherwise can wear Bewear down much more quickly. Cleaners such as Barbaracle and Shaymin appreciate Bewear's wallbreaking prowess and ability to pressure threats like Golisopod and Registeel, with Shaymin being capable of supporting Bewear with Healing Wish as well. Ghost-types are an issue even with proper coverage, as they are immune to both STAB moves, and locking Bewear into Shadow Claw can generate free turns for certain threats such as Barbaracle and Virizion, so having a Pursuit trapper such as Drapion, Houndoom, or Metagross could help ease Bewear's time wallbreaking.</p>"

In addition, Queenly Majesty makes Tsareena immune to priority moves, letting it serve as an offensive check to Mega Abomasnow and Honchkrow if it uses High Jump Kick. Tsareena's Speed puts it above base 70s such as Honchkrow and Metagross, but it's still slower than Mega Blastoise, Necrozma, and Nidoqueen, all of which can severely hurt Tsareena or KO it. Lastly, it competes with Virizion, Roserade, and Shaymin as an offensive Grass-type wallbreaker but has the niche of being a Rapid Spin user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band is an option to turn Tsareena into a powerful and unexpected wallbreaker, however, this set heavily competes with Virizion. It does, however, have the advantage of being far more initially threatening. Even though Tsareena is pressed for moves, U-turn can be a good option if you wish to preserve momentum, as Tsareena can force some switches such as against Milotic with its strong STAB move and Grass typing. Aromatherapy is also another option, letting Tsareena cure teammates' status ailments and acting as an offensive cleric.  Finally, a defensive set is viable on Tsareena with Trop Kick, Knock Off, Synthesis, and Rapid Spin, holding Leftovers, and utilizing a bulkier EV spread. Play Rough alongside Fairium Z can be used to nuke Mandibuzz and other Pokemon that can usually take a hit such as Virizion, Noivern, and Bewear.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Because of Tsareena's fairly low Speed, it can be KOed by Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Salazzle, Yanmega, Noivern, and Ninetales.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: If using Life Orb, residual damage from Stealth Rock, Toxic, and burn can rack up fairly quickly and Tsareena may be pressured.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Salazzle resists not only Power Whip, but High Jump Kick as well and can survive a Knock Off if Salazzle is holding a Z-Crystal. Other Fire-types like Arcanine and Ninetales can switch into Tsareena and threaten it out but must be careful to not take too much damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Venusaur resists both Power Whip and High Jump Kick but has to be wary of Knock Off. Rotom-C can pack Will-O-Wisp to burn Tsareena, but other than that it has no real way to damage it and takes a lot of damage from its moves. Virizion can enjoy an Attack boost thanks to Justified from switching into Knock Off, but it also has to be wary of High Jump Kick or Power Whip doing a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Escavalier 4x resists Power Whip and can severely damage or OHKO Tsareena with its STAB moves. Registeel can take on Tsareena without High Jump Kick, and even has Protect for variants with the move, but will lose its Leftovers in the process.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin is the main reason to use Tsareena, so it's a staple on this set. STAB Power Whip packs a stupendously strong punch that hurts everything that doesn't resist it. Knock Off is a good coverage move for a spinner to have, letting it hit Mismagius and Alolan Marowak while crippling Pokemon that rely on their items such as Registeel and Porygon2. Synthesis provides Tsareena with longevity, allowing it to check Milotic throughout the match and stay healthy to spin multiple times. However, High Jump Kick or Low Kick can be used in the last slot to give Tsareena more coverage and hit Porygon2, Mega Abomasnow and Registeel super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread is simple with maximum Attack and Speed investment. Meadow Plate boosts Power Whip's power without drawbacks, while Life Orb boosts the power of all of Tsareena's moves and allows it to function as more of a wallbreaker, especially with an Adamant nature. Lum Berry is another item option that cures Tsareena of a Scald burn or Toxic. A Jolly nature can be used at the expense of some firepower to outspeed Jolly Metagross, Honchkrow, and Tyrantrum, but the drop in power is noticeable. Queenly Majesty is the only viable ability Tsareena has, as it blocks priority from the likes of Mega Abomasnow, Zygarde-10%, Donphan, and Honchkrow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tsareena should primarily be used to spin away hazards for teammates such as Noivern, Golisopod, and Salazzle. In addition to this, it can also work as a wallbreaker with its powerful STAB and coverage moves. It's generally always preferred to use Knock Off first if the opponent has a Ghost-type, and KO them first before spinning. When using High Jump Kick, be careful of Protect users, most notably Registeel and Umbreon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock love having Tsareena as a partner. This includes Yanmega, Salazzle, Golisopod, Noivern, and Araquanid. Milotic and Slowking both have good synergy with Tsareena, sponging Fire- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Salazzle and Mega Glalie. Spikes users such as Cloyster and Golisopod benefit from having a Rapid Spin user instead of a Defogger. For that same reason, Tsareena can fit on Sticky Web teams, with setters of the move being Ribombee and Araquanid. Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Gardevoir can pair decently with Tsareena to provide speed control.</p>"

  "Passimian": {
    "overview": "<p>Passimian is a good Fighting-type in RU because it can act as a pivot, cleaner, and wallbreaker while also having good bulk to act as an offensive switch-in to the Bug-, Rock-, and Dark-types of RU such as Golisopod, Tyrantrum, and Drapion, as well as taking hits from Mega Blastoise and Virizion. It has a solid Speed tier that allows it to be faster than other Fighting-type wallbreakers like Bewear, Machamp, and Virizion with a Choice Scarf. Passimian is also the only viable Fighting-type with U-turn, making it a successful pivot and giving it a unique place among the sea of Fighting-types in RU. Defiant allows it to pressure Defog users such as Mandibuzz and Mantine as well as Sticky Web users such as Araquanid and Galvantula by boosting its Attack, so it can keep its team's entry hazards in battle. However, Passimian can't hit everything it wants in one moveset for super effective damage and its reliance on Choice items mean that Pokemon such as Slowbro, Golisopod, and Gardevoir can easily pivot against it if it goes for its Fighting-type STAB attack, making it somewhat easy to take advantage of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drain Punch is a neat move to provide extra longevity, but the move is rather weak compared to Close Combat and Passimian will never have room for it in a moveset. Acrobatics on the Choice Scarf set is a more accurate move to use against Pokemon like Golisopod, Toxicroak, and Virizion and can allow it to act as a more effective Knock Off sponge for late-game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Since Passimian relies on Choice items to be successful, it can easily be taken advantage of by Pokemon such as Golisopod, Golbat, Cresselia, and Gardevoir. This is especially the case if Passimian goes for Close Combat, since the aforementioned Pokemon proceed to threaten Passimian out of battle with their powerful STAB attacks. They do not want to risk switching into any of Passimian's coverage moves, however. Slowbro, in particular, can stomach any attack from Passimian and threaten it with a Scald burn or Toxic or simply recover the damage dealt with Slack Off and Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Passimian has issues with being worn down quickly, since it doesn't have a reliable method of recovery. Choice Scarf Passimian, in particular, is continually switching into attacks that chip away at its health. Both sets cannot combat status conditions very well, either; Toxic poison puts Passimian on a timer, burns from Scald or Will-O-Wisp halve its Attack, and paralysis cuts its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Choice Band Passimian is vulnerable to being forced out by faster Pokemon such as Ninetales, Roserade, and Toxicroak. Even with a Choice Scarf, Passimian is threatened out by Mega Sceptile and other Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Salazzle, and Noivern.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Passimian's strongest STAB attack and relatively safe to use. However, it does drop Passimian's defenses with each use, which can leave it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Pokemon it can't KO. U-turn is important so that Passimian escapes bad matchups against Pokemon like Slowbro, Cresselia, Gardevoir, Noivern, and Palossand as they attempt to switch in. Earthquake hits Poison-types such as Salazzle, Nidoqueen, Toxicroak, and Dragalge much harder than its other moves. Rock Slide can be run instead to hit Pokemon that resist Close Combat such as Golisopod and Noivern. Gunk Shot is also ideal for catching Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Florges and Grass-types such as Virizion and Shaymin off guard. Knock Off is another move to consider, since it removes the items from a defensive check such as Golbat, Sigilyph, and Florges.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf and proper investment, Passimian can outspeed Pokemon such as Raikou, Salazzle, and non-Choice Scarf Noivern and Speed tie with Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Defiant is the best ability to run to pressure Defog users such as Mandibuzz and Articuno as well as Sticky Web users like Ribombee and Araquanid.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Passimian's ability to force switches along with its access to U-turn to escape bad matchups is why it is a successful pivot in RU. It may have good bulk, but Passimian should not be used to take powerful attacks because it gets worn down enough by switching directly into entry hazards and even resisted hits. Because of this, try to bring Passimian in as a lead, after a teammate has fainted, or against more passive Pokemon such as Registeel. When making the play to come in against a passive Pokemon, be careful of potentially switching into a status move such as Toxic. Passimian's defensive typing can also be utilized to switch into Pokemon it can tank hits from such as Golisopod, Tyrantrum, and Mega Blastoise. If the foe decides to switch against Passimian, it would be wise to go for a coverage move to catch a predicted switch-in off guard, use Knock Off to remove items from a defensive switch-in, or simply use Close Combat. Although Close Combat is easy to spam, keep the drop to its defenses in mind, as they make Passimian much easier to revenge kill; be mindful of potential defensive switch-ins such as Slowbro, Gardevoir, and Golisopod as well. Knock Off is also a great move to spam throughout the game due to its lack of drawbacks and potential to remove items from defensive Pokemon like Bronzong and Golbat. If the foe is weakened enough, Passimian can act as a cleaner with its Choice Scarf. Because it needs its Choice Scarf to revenge kill and pivot successfully, Passimian needs to avoid Knock Off early- or mid-game. However, Passimian's resistance to the move can be valuable late-game if it can't do much else or has nothing left to revenge kill. Passimian also appreciates Spikes and Toxic Spikes cleared on its side, since it needs to be as healthy as it can to continue to play its part.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Passimian's pivoting abilities are greatly appreciated by slow wallbreakers such as Tyrantrum, Bewear, and Gardevoir and setup sweepers such as Raikou, Salazzle, and Virizion. Virizion can also create a Fighting spam core alongside Passimian, while Raikou, Salazzle, and Gardevoir can pressure physically defensive Pokemon for Passimian, making its time revenge killing and pivoting much easier. Entry hazard setters such as Metagross, Golisopod, and Roserade love Passimian's ability to pressure Defog users like Mandibuzz and Mantine. Metagross can also double as a Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-resistant teammate for Passimian. Sticky Web setters such as Araquanid and Ribombee can also make Passimian even more threatening by providing extra speed control. On the same note, an entry hazard remover such as Mega Blastoise, Forretress, or Tsareena is a good idea, since they can clear entry hazards away from Passimian's side, allowing it to pivot much more throughout the game. Passimian also needs defensive checks such as Slowbro, Gardevoir, and Golbat out of the way so it can have an easier time revenge killing. Teammates such as Shaymin, Drapion, and Rhyperior can help Passimian with that. A pivoting core can also be considered to allow Passimian's team to gain and keep offensive momentum. Partners like Yanmega, Forretress, and Ribombee can be paired for this reasoning. Ribombee can also lure in Steel-types for Passimian. Pokemon such as Necrozma, Slowbro, and Noivern greatly appreciate Passimian's defensive presence. Clerics like Florges, Diancie, and Vaporeon and Healing Wish users like Shaymin and Gardevoir can heal Passimian in case it has sustained prior damage.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Passimian's strongest STAB move that punches holes in anything that doesn't resist it. U-turn can allow Passimian to escape a potentially bad matchup such as against Slowbro, Cresselia, or Necrozma. Knock Off is a fantastic move that removes the items from defensive checks such as Golbat, Sigilyph, and Florges. Earthquake provides a wide amount of coverage and hits Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Toxicroak, and Dragalge very hard. Rock Slide can be used instead to deal super effective damage to Pokemon such as Noivern, Golisopod, and Mantine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread and a Choice Band, Passimian can power through Pokemon that normally aren't threatened by the Choice Scarf set such as Donphan, Milotic, and Diancie while still being able to outspeed Pokemon such as Bewear, Tyrantrum, and Mega Blastoise and Speed tie with Choice Specs Gardevoir. Defiant allows Passimian to come in against Defog users such as Mandibuzz and Mantine and Sticky Web in order to boost its Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Passimian is a powerful wallbreaker that can be used throughout a game. It can spam Knock Off to cripple defensive checks, pivot with U-turn early-game, and potentially clean up late-game if its checks and counters are gone. Bring Passimian in against Pokemon it resists attacks from such as Golisopod and Mega Blastoise. Another method is to try to bring Passimian in against a Defog user such as Mandibuzz or Mantine so that it can gain an Attack boost and punish anything that attempts to come in against it. This play can be rather risky, as the Defog user could predict this and go for a move such as Brave Bird or Scald instead. Because Passimian forces a lot of switches, it can be a good idea to go for a coverage move to catch a defensive check to Close Combat off guard, use Knock Off to remove an item, or pivot with U-turn to bring in a partner better suited to dealing with said threat. Be aware of using Close Combat because not only does the move only have 8 PP, but the defense drops can make Passimian easier to revenge kill. Keep Passimian away from status conditions, as they can shorten its time wallbreaking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special attackers such as Raikou, Ninetales, and Mega Sceptile appreciate Passimian's ability to threaten special walls so that they have an easier time sweeping late-game. Salazzle is another great partner, since it can threaten Fairy-types for Passimian. Other offensive Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Swellow, and Shaymin love Passimian's ability to threaten Steel-types so that they can spam their STAB moves more often. Gardevoir can also help Passimian by pressuring Poison-types and providing Healing Wish support. Because Passimian can pivot with U-turn, wallbreakers such as Mismagius, Necrozma, and Zygarde-10% appreciate being brought in safely into battle. Other Pokemon such as Ribombee, Noivern, and Forretress can form a pivoting core with Passimian. Entry hazard setters such as Necrozma, Golisopod, and Roserade love that Passimian can pressure Defog users with Defiant so that their entry hazards stay in battle. Sticky Web users such as Araquanid, Ribombee, and Galvantula can also make Passimian extra threatening. Passimian appreciates support from Pokemon such as Drapion, Tyrantrum, and Donphan, as they can pressure the Fairy-, Flying-, and Poison-types that give it trouble. Anti-offense Pokemon such as Golisopod, Choice Scarf Noivern, and Mega Sceptile can help Passimian by revenge killing Pokemon faster than Passimian that would revenge kill it, which makes its time wallbreaking much easier.</p>"

  "Golisopod": {
    "overview": "<p>Golisopod has cemented itself as one of the best revenge killers in RU thanks to its access to a powerful STAB-boosted priority First Impression, which can easily pick off weakened threats such as Virizion, Barbaracle, and Metagross. It also has Aqua Jet to revenge kill Pokemon that resist First Impression, such as Salazzle, Arcanine, Rhyperior, and Nidoqueen. Golisopod's high Attack can also make it a threatening wallbreaker that can force switches, which can allow it to set up Spikes to add more offensive pressure against the opposing team and make it nearly impossible to switch directly into it. Golisopod can also defensively check Pokemon such as Metagross, Zygarde-10%, and Passimian thanks to its solid bulk and typing. While these attributes are amazing, Golisopod is very easily worn down by Stealth Rock and status conditions. While its ability Emergency Exit can sometimes be useful, it adds to Golisopod's problem of being worn down by entry hazards easily, especially if it is holding a Sitrus Berry. Since First Impression only works on the first turn Golisopod is in battle, it can be forced out by faster Pokemon like Noivern, Gardevoir, and Raikou after it has used the move. Its low Speed not only forces Golisopod out against super effective attacks but also can make Golisopod fail to move before Extreme Speed, especially from users like Zygarde-10% and Arcanine. Golisopod can also have trouble breaking some Pokemon like Milotic, Mantine, and Toxicroak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other moves like Rock Slide and Dual Chop can potentially work, since Golisopod lures in Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Noivern, Mantine, and Dragalge. However, they have little use outside of hitting these targets. Drill Run is another move to consider, since it can stop Barbaracle and Toxicroak from setting up in front of Golisopod. Knock Off is a decent option to cripple some of Golisopod's defensive checks like Choice Scarf Noivern, Milotic, and Forretress. Choice Band can be utilized to boost Golisopod's Attack to absurd levels, but being locked into one move, especially if it's First Impression, can make Golisopod more exploitable by the foe and forces it out much more often.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Golisopod is vulnerable to all entry hazards and loses a quarter of its health every time it comes into battle from Stealth Rock alone. Emergency Exit doesn't help with this weakness, as Golisopod is forced out of battle and is chipped further if hazards are still on the field.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Golisopod dislikes being afflicted with status conditions, as Toxic poison and burns limit its time in battle and force it to lose offensive momentum. Although it can soft check Water-types, bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Mantine, and Slowbro can survive First Impression and threaten Golisopod with a potential Scald burn. Dragalge, in particular, is not threatened by any of Golisopod's moves and can begin setting Toxic Spikes in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: After it has used First Impression, Golisopod falls prey to faster Pokemon such as Toxicroak, Mega Sceptile, and Goodra. Toxicroak can come in against Golisopod and begin setting up with Swords Dance. Mega Sceptile can also use Protect against Golisopod's First Impression and threaten it out with Leaf Storm. Other setup sweepers like Bewear can take advantage of Golisopod after it has used First Impression and begin setting up.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Noivern, Swellow, and Honchkrow can force Golisopod out of battle after it has used First Impression with their super effective STAB moves. Noivern, in particular, completely walls Golisopod's STAB attacks and threatens it out with Hurricane or Taunt. However, Honchkrow does not want to stay in against Insect Plate Golisopod, as First Impression will OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raikou, Mega Ampharos, and Galvantula also threaten Golisopod out of battle with their powerful STAB attacks. Mega Ampharos, in particular, can take one First Impression and retaliate with Thunderbolt. However, Raikou and Galvantula do not want to stay in or come in against any of Golisopod's moves, especially First Impression.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon such as Virizion and Machamp can potentially thwart Golisopod by running coverage moves like Stone Edge or Rock Slide that deal super effective damage to it.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>First Impression is Golisopod's best move, allowing it to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Gardevoir, Virizion, and Roserade thanks to STAB and its high power. Liquidation has wide coverage and can severely dent Pokemon that resist First Impression such as Registeel, Donphan, Diancie, and Rhyperior. Leech Life is a good secondary Bug STAB move that also gives Golisopod an option to heal itself and threaten bulky Pokemon like Cresselia, Slowbro, and Tangela after it uses First Impression. Spikes can provide further offensive pressure for its team. Although weaker, Aqua Jet is another priority move that can pick off Pokemon like Salazzle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with an Adamant nature makes Golisopod as powerful and as bulky as it can be while still outpacing uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon like Registeel and Diancie. Sitrus Berry is the preferred item, since it gives Golisopod a chance to heal itself so it isn't forced out by Emergency Exit as quickly. Insect Plate allows Golisopod to OHKO Zygarde-10%, as well as Honchkrow with First Impression after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golisopod is a revenge killer that can also function as a wallbreaker. Because of its Stealth Rock weakness and Emergency Exit, it is important to keep Golisopod as healthy as possible. This also means keeping it away from status conditions. To achieve this, make sure that entry hazards are cleared and know when to bring Golisopod into battle. It is best that Golisopod is brought in with the help of a pivot, after another teammate has fainted, or against Pokemon it resists the moves of such as Metagross, Donphan, and Zygarde-10%. However, if entry hazards are still up and the team's spinner has been taken out, it is best to limit Golisopod's use as a check to weakened faster offensive Pokemon, since it loses a quarter of its health every time it enters the battle from Stealth Rock alone. Once it is in battle, use First Impression or Aqua Jet to take out a weakened Pokemon. Golisopod forces switches thanks to its raw power, so use this opportunity to either go for a coverage move to catch a potential switch-in expecting First Impression off guard or begin setting up Spikes on switch-ins such as Noivern. Keep in mind that when running Sitrus Berry, Golisopod will still be forced out by Emergency Exit after it consumes its item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golisopod fits on a myriad of teams thanks to its amazing revenge killing capabilities. Entry hazard removal is crucial when using Golisopod. Rapid Spin is preferred to avoid getting rid of Golisopod's own Spikes, so partners like Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Forretress are valuable. Mega Blastoise can also take Scald for Golisopod and threaten Pokemon like Noivern, while Donphan can also help keep Raikou in check. Xatu is another Pokemon to consider, since it can beat every Steel-type Stealth Rock setter. Pivots like Noivern, Forretress, and Mega Ampharos can get Golisopod safely into the battle. Noivern can also provide Taunt support to dissuade Defog users from removing Golisopod's Spikes. Other offensive Pokemon such as Raikou, Arcanine, and Virizion appreciate Golisopod's Spikes, as they can make wallbreaking and cleaning much easier. Raikou can also help pressure Flying-types for Golisopod. Virizion and Raikou can also pressure defensive Water-types like Milotic and Mantine. Clerics and Healing Wish users like Wish Florges, Diancie, and Gardevoir can help keep Golisopod healthy. Steel-type teammates like Metagross, Registeel, and Bronzong are also good teammates to consider, since they can switch directly into Flying-type attacks for Golisopod and take Toxic for it. All of these Pokemon can also make a hazard stacking core with Golisopod, while it can pressure Fire-types such as Salazzle and Arcanine for them in return. Although it can come in against Fighting-types like Machamp and Bewear, Golisopod is still checked by these Pokemon, since it is threatened by their powerful moves and they resist First Impression. Teammates like Noivern, Necrozma, and Gardevoir can help keep these Pokemon in check. Other Pokemon that can threaten Toxicroak out, such as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Swellow, are also appreciated, since Toxicroak completely walls Golisopod.</p>"

  "Palossand": {
    "overview": "<p>With its high Defense, Ghost / Ground typing, and reliable recovery in Shore Up, Palossand is able to lay Stealth Rock against Donphan and Forretress while also blocking their attempts to remove its entry hazards away with Rapid Spin. It also makes for a serviceable check to many of the tier's physical attackers, such as Rhyperior, Tyrantrum, Zygarde-10%, Escavalier, and Toxicroak and can lay Stealth Rock against them or use Earth Power to force them out. However, Palossand loses terribly to the tier's most common Rapid Spin user, Mega Blastoise, and fails to block Defog, doing very little to common Defoggers like Mandibuzz and Flygon, apart from Toxic. In addition, Palossand sports few valuable resistances outside of Rock, and its susceptibility to common Dark- and Grass-type attacks makes it difficult to fit onto a team and requires more specific team support to help it do its job.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Groundium Z or Ghostium Z can be attached to Palossand in order for it to threaten big damage on many foes it checks while still blocking Knock Off, but your Z-Crystal is usually best used elsewhere.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Palossand's uninvested Special Defense means that even neutral special attacks, like Salazzle's Fire Blast and Noivern's Hurricane, can threaten to 2HKO it. Super effective attacks also bring it down very quickly, like Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse and Mismagius's Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: As Palossand has no way of blocking the move, it is gravely threatened by Toxic, which cuts into its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Espeon and Xatu</strong>: Taking little or no damage from Earth Power and bouncing back Stealth Rock and Toxic, Espeon and Xatu fear only the rare Shadow Ball and will otherwise give Palossand a lot of trouble.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Shaymin and Roserade care very little for Toxic and can use Palossand as a free turn to either fire off a powerful attack or, in Roserade's case, set Spikes. Other Grass-types such as Virizion and Mega Sceptile don't care for Palossand's attacks either and can easily force it out.</p>",

      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power is chosen as a reliable STAB move due to its ability to deal good damage to a lot of the Pokemon that Palossand is tasked with dealing with, namely opposing Rock-types as well as Donphan. Shore Up provides reliable recovery to keep Palossand healthy in the face of residual damage, and helps it come in on threats to check them. Stealth Rock is a must for any team, and Palossand can use its good matchups against many physical attackers as an opportunity to set them. Toxic is able to exert lasting pressure on switch-ins that don't care about Earth Power, like Virizion, Mandibuzz, Golisopod, and Necrozma.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment is used to check Donphan and other physical attackers as well as possible. Leftovers is chosen because the passive recovery helps keep Palossand healthy throughout the match. Colbur Berry can also be used to be able to switch into and take Knock Off from Pokemon that Palossand is used to checking, like Machamp and Donphan. Though not coming into play often, Water Compaction is used for catching a +2 Defense boost off Golisopod's Aqua Jet, though it's the only common Water-type attack that doesn't threaten to 2HKO Palossand.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Palossand in liberally against Fighting- and Rock-types that can't harm it very much, like Toxicroak, Machamp, and Rhyperior. Palossand can use Stealth Rock as these Pokemon switch out or, if Stealth Rock is already up, fire off an Earth Power. Shore Up's PP should be conserved and only used when needed, as Palossand will need to stay healthy throughout the battle in order to continue checking threats. Be wary of Toxic, as it cuts into Palossand's longevity, and it has no way to block the move itself. Palossand should be played with caution around Pokemon known to commonly carry Dark-type coverage moves, such as Mega Blastoise and Machamp, as it doesn't want its Colbur Berry used unnecessarily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers that appreciate Stealth Rock and can take on the Water- and Grass-types that threaten Palossand are good teammates; notable examples of this include Goodra, Toxicroak, Roserade, and Shaymin. Heal Bell support from Vaporeon and Florges is appreciated, as Palossand hates Toxic. These Pokemon's good Special Defense also enables them to take on problematic special attackers like Noivern and, in Vaporeon's case, Nidoqueen and Salazzle. Palossand can fit on some entry hazard stacking teams due to its ability to block Rapid Spin, so Spikes or Toxic Spikes users that appreciate Palossand spinblocking Donphan, like Roserade, Dragalge, and Golisopod pair well with it. Golisopod can also threaten Espeon very well. Teammates that benefit from Fighting- and Rock-types being dealt with, such as Snorlax, Ninetales, and Salazzle, work well with Palossand. Fighting-types that can threaten Dark-types, like Bewear, Passimian, and Virizion, also work well and appreciate Stealth Rock being in play to wear down their checks and assist in their wallbreaking.</p>"

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>Pyukumuku is almost a necessity on stall teams due to its ability to deal with many stall-threatening setup sweepers in RU such as Snorlax, Salazzle, and Necrozma. Thanks to Unaware, Pyukumuku is a natural pick on these type of teams due to its solid bulk and access to reliable recovery. Its combination of Block and Toxic allows it to trap and eliminate threats such as Ninetales and Bewear with passive damage, preventing them from damaging the team's defensive backbone. Additionally, access to a rare move in Soak allows it to remove the STAB boost from the attacks of foes, allowing Pyukumuku to better deal with Pokemon like Salazzle that it would be unable to wall otherwise. However, its complete lack of offensive presence due to its lack of damaging moves means it is only viable on stall teams and makes it complete Taunt and Substitute bait from the likes of Mandibuzz and Mismagius. Furthermore, despite its very solid defensive stats, Pyukumuku can still be taken advantage of by strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Gardevoir and Choice Band Tyrantrum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastro Acid can allow Pyukumuku to bypass Magic Guard, Magic Bounce, Guts. and Synchronize safely, enabling it to inflict their users with Toxic poison and beat them. Poisonium Z could be used to better switch into Knock Off and to bypass Taunt by powering up Toxic; however, Pyukumuku still loses 1v1 against most Taunt users, and using Poisonium Z means Pyukumuku doesn't get the passive recovery offered by Leftovers. Counter allows Pyukumuku to defeat physical attackers more easily, but losing out on the ability to trap and reliably eliminate Pokemon is not ideal. Protect can be used to scout and cushion a Z-Move, such as Salazzle's Acid Downpour or Cloyster's Breakneck Blitz. However, Pyukumuku once again has trouble fitting this on its moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute Users</strong>: Due to Pyukumuku's passive nature, Taunt and Substitute users such as Mismagius and Raikou can be devastating, since they can use it as setup fodder while Pyukumuku can't do anything back to them.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with Magic Guard, Guts, and Magic Bounce are immune to anything Pyukumuku can throw at them. Magic Bounce deserves a special mention, since if Pyukumuku uses Block or Toxic, they can easily take advantage of it. However, Gastro Acid variants can bypass their immunity (except Magic Bounce). Rest users such as CurseLax are also capable of shrugging off status and PP stalling Pyukumuku not running Spite.</p> <p><strong>Electric- and Grass-types</strong>: Shaymin and Roserade can come into any move Pyukumuku uses and always at least 2HKO it with their respective Grass-type STAB moves. They don't mind even mind Toxic due to Natural Cure and Roserade's Poison typing. Electric-types such as Raikou can heavily dent it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite Pyukumuku's solid defenses, its low HP stat allows Choice Specs users like Espeon, Yanmega, and Gardevoir to take advantage of its uninvested Special Defense and 2HKO it. Physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyrantrum can also 2HKO Pyukumuku. Mold Breaker Pangoro also ignores Unaware.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Status inducers such as Metagross, Forretress, and Cresselia can severely cripple Pyukumuku, as it will be placed on a timer. Pyukumuku is also very vulnerable to all three forms of entry hazards, which sometimes makes it difficult for Pyukumuku to switch into the field. While burns arent as threatening, they force it to recover more than it would prefer.</p>",

      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Soak allows Pyukumuku to inflict Poison- and Steel-types with Toxic poison, as well as remove the STAB boost from the attacks of foes, which can help Pyukumuku take strong neutral hits from wallbreakers and Z-Move users. Block lets Pyukumuku trap Pokemon and stall them out with Toxic; eliminating key threats to stall teams. Additionally, it prevents the opponent from continuously switching between two Steel- or Poison-types, which would effectively prevent Pyukumuku from doing anything. Spite lets Pyukumuku PP stall defensive threats it would otherwise be unable to beat such as Snorlax, and waste PP for moves such as Synthesis or Heal Bell. If running Spite, Rest is an option to aid Pyukumuku in PP stalling the opponent. It can also allow it to act as a status absorber for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature simply maximizes Pyukumuku's physical bulk. A more specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 SpD with a Calm nature allows Pyukumuku to take Salazzle's Acid Downpour into Sludge Wave after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Pyukumuku's stellar bulk and defensive typing, Pyukumuku can be used as a direct switch-in to the Pokemon that it can check such as Barbaracle and Zygarde-10%. Use it as a counter to setup sweepers such as Necrozma and Cloyster that can threaten the team if they get out of control. Make sure to use Recover liberally so Pyukumuku remains healthy enough to check what it needs to throughout the match, and utilize Wish or Heal Bell from its teammates if it's at lower health or statused. Use the combination of Soak and Toxic on defensive Poison- and Steel-types such as Dragalge and non-Choice Band Escavalier to wear them down easily. If the opponent has two Steel- or Poison-types and is switching between them to prevent them from being inflicted with Toxic poison, trap one of them with Block and proceed to Toxic stall it. Remember that trying to inflict Toxic poison on offensive Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Choice Band Escavalier is not always worth the trouble, since Pyukumuku will be forced to tank at least two hits in the process, making it an unwise choice if Pyukumuku is low on health. Soak also removes the STAB damage boost from foes, which makes the matchup against Pokemon such as Salazzle and Bewear much more favorable. Avoid switching into multiple layers of entry hazards with Pyukumuku, since it can get worn down easily and has difficulty checking threats when weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pyukumuku appreciates being paired with a cleric such as Articuno. These allow it to play more recklessly, since they can heal it late-game with Wish and cure its status condition with Heal Bell. Fairium Z Cresselia can provide a much-needed answer to Mold Breaker Pangoro, which can otherwise run through an unprepared stall team, as well as a check to many Pokemon that threaten Pyukumuku such as Rotom-C, Virizion, and Mega Ampharos. A Defog user such as Mandibuzz or Articuno can remove entry hazards so Pyukumuku can stay healthy more easily and more reliably counter setup sweepers thanks to Unaware. Registeel acts as a blanket check to special attackers and provides utility in Stealth Rock, helping wear down the opposing team further. Xatu can be used to bounce Taunt, Toxic, and entry hazards back to the opposing side of the field. Dragalge can always check Salazzle without having to play around its Acid Downpour, which can be valuable for Pyukumuku’s team.</p>"

  "Bruxish": {
    "overview": "<p>Bruxish is a potentially threatening attacker in the RU metagame thanks to its plethora of valuable offensive traits. Its high Attack alongside an obscenely powerful STAB- and Strong Jaw-boosted Psychic Fangs allows Bruxish to perfectly complement its access to Swords Dance and decent Speed tier as a sweeper or wallbreaker on offensive teams. Alongside its powerful Psychic Fangs, Bruxish has access to useful STAB priority in the form of Aqua Jet as well as a powerful coverage option in Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch, which further bolsters its offensive presence. Unfortunately, said offensive presence is slightly offset by Bruxish's abysmal bulk, as it will often struggle to survive attacks from Pokemon that it fails to KO, which are quite common in the metagame. Bruxish's Speed, while good, can also hamper it at times, as it is still outsped and heavily threatened by common Pokemon such as Ninetales, Mismagius, and Shaymin. Bruxish also struggles from four-moveslot syndrome in that it often has to decide between running Crunch or Liquidation, meaning that it will always struggle to break through a certain foe. Lastly, choosing Bruxish's nature can also be a struggle, as Bruxish will slightly lack power with a Jolly nature and be slightly slow with an Adamant nature.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf is also an option to help circumvent Bruxish's only decent Speed, though it leaves Bruxish with a notable lack of power.  Poison Fang can be used to hit Grass- and Fairy-types super effectively; however, most Pokemon of these types are already hit hard enough by Psychic Fangs. Bruxish can opt to use its Dazzling ability, as it can avoid priority from the likes of Toxicroak, Golisopod, and Honchkrow. However, this leaves Bruxish extremely weak, as it is unable to take advantage of the power Strong Jaw provides to Psychic Fangs, Crunch, and Ice Fang. It also has Aqua Jet to help circumvent its vulnerability to priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are immune to Psychic Fangs and can threaten to OHKO Bruxish with super effective STAB attacks. Honchkrow can threaten Bruxish with priority Sucker Punch while Drapion outspeeds it; both are able to trap it with Pursuit, while Umbreon can almost always tank a hit and OHKO Bruxish with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Escavalier, Metagross, Bronzong, and Registeel can all tank a hit and threaten Bruxish with either super effective STAB attacks in the case of the former two or status in the case of the latter two. However, most don't appreciate taking a boosted Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Due to Bruxish's abysmal bulk, it is easily forced out by both faster threats and strong priority. Flygon, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Shaymin can all tank an Aqua Jet and OHKO Bruxish, while Golisopod's First Impression, Honchkrow's Sucker Punch, and Arcanine's Extreme Speed are also quite threatening.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: If Bruxish isn't running Crunch, it is easily walled by the likes of Necrozma, Slowbro, and Cresselia, which can all tank a hit and retaliate with either super effective coverage attacks, entry hazards, or status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is mandatory for boosting Bruxish's Attack to extremely threatening levels and enabling it to sweep. Psychic Fangs is Bruxish's STAB attack of choice and receives a boost in power from both STAB and Strong Jaw; it is thus an obscenely powerful option that is capable of OHKOing several metagame threats when boosted. Aqua Jet is a strong STAB priority attack that allows Bruxish to pick off weakened threats and, when boosted, OHKO the likes of Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill it such as Aerodactyl and Salazzle. Crunch provides excellent coverage alongside Bruxish's STAB attacks, allowing it to, when boosted, likely OHKO Pokemon that would otherwise wall it in Slowbro and Cresselia after Stealth Rock damage. Liquidation is an option over Crunch that sacrifices coverage for power against defensive Pokemon, and it more reliably KOes Diancie, Donphan, and Rhyperior. Lastly, Ice Fang is an option for hitting Mandibuzz, as well as other Pokemon like Tyrantrum, Tangela, and Flygon super effectively, although the coverage it provides is overall less useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed allows Bruxish to be as fast and powerful as possible, and as a result, maintain an impressive offensive presence. A Jolly nature maximizes Bruxish's Speed and allows it to outpace all defensive Pokemon as well as Roserade, Rotom-C, Gardevoir, and Goodra. An Adamant nature can be used, however, to aid Bruxish in more reliably pressuring bulkier foes at the cost of being outsped by the aforementioned threats. Life Orb provides Bruxish's already strong moves with a vital boost in power, allowing it to secure the OHKO on Slowbro and Bronzong with a boosted Crunch as well as the 2HKO on Registeel and Umbreon with a boosted Liquidation. Waterium Z, coupled with Aqua Tail can be used on Swords Dance sets to blow past usual counters such as Escavalier, Umbreon, and Forretress while still hitting most of Crunch's targets, such as Metagross, Bronzong, and Cresselia. It does, however, make it significantly more vulnerable to Slowbro. Strong Jaw is the preferred ability, as it gives Psychic Fangs its immense power and Crunch a 1.5x boost in power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can function in many different ways and consistently be put to good use in matches. It functions as a sweeper once Bruxish's checks have been removed or weakened as well as a wallbreaker against bulkier teams. If Bruxish is attempting a sweep, it is best that faster threats that can take an Aqua Jet such as Shaymin and Virizion are removed, as they will otherwise outspeed and KO Bruxish, thus preventing its sweep. Carriers of powerful priority such as Golisopod, Comfey, Honchkrow, and Zygarde-10% are also best removed, as Bruxish's poor bulk alongside the recoil it will take from Life Orb can eventually leave it quite susceptible to being revenge killed. Setup opportunities can be hard to find at times and should thus be capitalized on whenever they appear. Bruxish can set up on defensive Pokemon that won't be able to deal sufficient damage to it, such as Milotic and Bronzong, as well as against Pokemon that it forces out like Diancie, Toxicroak, and Venusaur. Lastly, due to its poor bulk, Bruxish should never try switching into an attack; it should be brought in with slow pivot support or after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful offensive threats capable of weakening or chipping away at bulkier foes, such as Tyrantrum, Virizion, and Swellow, can aid Bruxish in dealing with bulky threats that it would otherwise struggle to break, such as Registeel, Umbreon, and Escavalier, late-game. Dark-type checks such as Toxicroak, Machamp, and Gardevoir can dent Umbreon for Bruxish as well as dispose of big threats to it in Toxicroak, Pangoro, and Honchkrow. Steel-type checks are also quite useful to Bruxish due to their ability to weaken or KO the likes of Escavalier, Registeel, and Klinklang, which are all quite troublesome for it. The aforementioned Fighting-types work as checks to both Dark- and Steel-types, though Arcanine, Nidoqueen, and Donphan can all adequately check Steel-types as well. If Bruxish does not use Crunch, checks to bulky Psychic-types such as Metagross, Pangoro, and Yanmega are valuable teammates, as Bruxish otherwise struggles to break past the likes of Necrozma, Slowbro, and Cresselia. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Necrozma and Nidoqueen is helpful for Bruxish, as with either Stealth Rock or Spikes damage, it is capable of more reliably breaking past bulkier foes. Bruxish really appreciates Sticky Web support from Galvantula or Araquanid in particular, as it allows Bruxish to outpace the entire unboosted metagame, thus circumventing its only decent Speed.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic Fangs is an obscenely powerful STAB attack when boosted by Choice Band and is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing most of the metagame. Aqua Jet is powerful STAB priority that is useful for picking off weakened threats. Liquidation is a powerful STAB option that allows Bruxish to hit the likes of Gigalith, Donphan, and Diancie for respectable damage. Crunch rounds off Bruxish's coverage and allows it to 2HKO Pokemon that would otherwise freely switch into it even after Stealth Rock damage such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and Necrozma. Ice Fang is able to take out Mandibuzz after Stealth Rock, which would otherwise completely wall Bruxish, as well as hitting Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types super effectively, but it is very hard to fit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack with a Choice Band allows Bruxish to hit as hard as possible and function as an extremely threatening wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment is also quite important for outpacing defensive foes, and with a Jolly nature, barely outpacing and threatening the likes of Roserade, Goodra, Sawk, Rotom-C, and Medicham. An Adamant nature is also an option, sacrificing the ability to outspeed the aforementioned threats for more power behind Bruxish's attacks. Strong Jaw is the preferred ability, as it puts an immense amount of power behind Bruxish's Psychic Fangs as well as a decent amount of power behind its Crunch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the nature of Choice Band, this set must be used with careful prediction in order to help Bruxish properly function as a wallbreaker. In order to do this, predicting switches into Pokemon resistant or immune to Psychic Fangs, such as Umbreon and Metagross, and using Liquidation or a coverage option to hit them for sufficient damage is key to Bruxish's success. Once foes resistant or immune to Psychic Fangs have been removed and faster foes have been picked off, Bruxish should feel free to spam Psychic Fangs, as the move's immense power will break through most Pokemon neutral or weak to it quite effectively. Steel- and Dark-types should ideally be removed in order to make full use of this set, as none of Bruxish's coverage options are particularly useful against most defensive Pokemon of these types, which will often severely dent Bruxish while taking hits. Honchkrow, Sneasel, and Drapion are Pokemon that tend to carry Pursuit, which can trap and KO Bruxish. If any of these Pokemon are on the opposing team, Bruxish must be especially careful when using Psychic Fangs, as even if it nets a KO with the move, any of the aforementioned threats can come into play, take no damage, and trap and revenge kill Bruxish with ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams that need a Pokemon capable of breaking through defensive teams very much appreciate this set, as Bruxish's good Speed allows it to function as a powerful wallbreaker that also isn't pressured by offensive teams too heavily. This set is also appreciated by bulky offense teams, as most Pokemon found on these teams, such as Houndoom and Escavalier, have great offensive synergy with Bruxish. Entry hazard support from the likes of Nidoqueen, Metagross, and Rhyperior is almost mandatory, as with either Stealth Rock or Spikes on the field, Bruxish is capable of more reliably KOing Slowbro, Cresselia, and more. Sticky Web in particular is a great entry hazard to support Bruxish with, as upon being able to outpace the entire unboosted metagame, it becomes extremely difficult to switch into and revenge kill. Galvantula and Araquanid are both capable of supporting Bruxish, and the former can even threaten Dark-types for Bruxish with STAB Bug Buzz. Fighting-types like Bewear, Pangoro, and Passimian make good partners, as they can allow Bruxish to more freely spam Psychic Fangs later in a match by removing the Dark- and Steel-types that threaten it. If a Fighting-type Pokemon isn't wanted, however, then other checks to Dark-types such as Florges, Comfey, and Diancie are all appreciated. Steel-type checks are also useful, as Bruxish is even more vulnerable to the likes of Escavalier and Registeel with this set. Rhyperior, Salazzle, and Ninetales are all capable of adequately functioning as checks to them.</p>"

  "Dhelmise": {
    "overview": "<p>One of Dhelmise's niches in RU is its ability to function as a reliable spinner. Thanks to its high Attack stat and strong Power Whip and Anchor Shot, it can beat some common Stealth Rock setters like Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, and Diancie. Additionally, Dhelmise can even beat Stealth Rock setters such as Registeel and Bronzong by trapping them with Anchor Shot and stalling out their PP with Rest. Furthermore, Dhelmise's Ghost / Grass typing and decent bulk allow it to check common threats like Virizion, Zygarde-10%, and Raikou. On top of that, it can also act as a solid spinblocker against Donphan, Forretress, and Tsareena. However, Dhelmise's typing also gives it weaknesses to common types such as Dark, Flying, and Fire. Unfortunately, this leaves Dhelmise unable to check Mega Blastoise like other Grass-types, which can makes it awkward to build a team with. Furthermore, Dhelmise is very slow, so it's easily revenge killed by other threats like Ninetales, Salazzle, and Noivern. However, note that many of these Pokemon can't switch into Dhelmise's attacks very well thanks to its offensive presence. Another problem is that Dhelmise's recovery moves have their own drawbacks. Synthesis's low PP makes Dhelmise less effective against defensive teams, while Rest makes it less effective against offensive teams because the sleep turns allow various Pokemon to take advantage of it, especially setup sweepers like Necrozma, Lycanroc-D, and Toxicroak. Last but not least, it competes not only with other Grass-types but also with many other spinners like Donphan, Forretress, Tsareena, and especially Mega Blastoise, all of which have better Speed tiers, greater coverage, or more support options or are just easier to fit on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Claw can be used over Power Whip to hit Steel- and Fire-types harder, but it's very weak beside that. A Choice Band set allows Dhelmise to work as a powerful wallbreaker. However, Dhelmise is outclassed offensively by Virizion and even Tsareena in this role, which have better Speed tiers, greater coverage, and in the case of Virizion, access to Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Salazzle, Ninetales, Houndoom, and Arcanine can easily OHKO Dhelmise with their powerful STAB Fire-type moves and force it out. They also resist Power Whip and Anchor Shot, so they can easily switch into Dhelmise most of the time. However, they have trouble directly switching in if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Moves</strong>: If Dhelmise holds a Colbur Berry, it reduces the danger of Dark-types like Drapion, Pangoro, and Umbreon, but they still threaten Dhelmise with their powerful STAB moves. Without the item's weakening effect, Pokemon like Drapion, Metagross, Escavalier, and Honchkrow can Pursuit trap Dhelmise and remove it from battle. As soon as the Berry has been eaten, Mega Blastoise threatens Dhelmise with its powerful Dark Pulse. However, none of these Pokemon except Escavalier can switch well into Dhelmise's Power Whip or Anchor Shot, although they can switch in easily on a Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Noivern and Honchkrow can OHKO Dhelmise with their STAB moves. As already mentioned above, Honchkrow can also Pursuit trap Dhelmise. In most cases, Mandibuzz has nothing to fear from Dhelmise and can stall it out with the combination of Roost, Taunt, and Toxic. However, Honchkrow and Noivern can be KOed by Corkscrew Crash, while Mandibuzz can be too if it's at low health.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Though Dhelmise's bulk is decent, strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Metagross, Choice Band Tyrantrum, Choice Specs Goodra, and Dragalge can easily defeat it.</p>",

      "Bulky Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dhelmise is a reliable spinner thanks to its ability to beat common Stealth Rock setters either with its powerful moves or by trapping and stalling them out. Power Whip is Dhelmise's strongest STAB move and hits Stealth Rock setters like Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, and Palossand very hard. Thanks to Dhelmise's ability in Steelworker, Anchor Shot receives the same power boost as a STAB move, which allows Dhelmise to OHKO Diancie and hit Flying- and Grass-types like Noivern, Virizion, and Roserade for good damage. It also traps opposing Pokemon and gives Dhelmise the ability to prevent double switches as well as PP stall walls like Registeel and Bronzong with Rest. Rest is used over Synthesis because it gives Dhelmise a better matchup versus Bronzong and Registeel and allows it to act as a status absorber for the team. However, Synthesis can be used to better check threats like Virizion, Zygarde-10%, and Raikou. However, Synthesis has low PP, and without Rest, Dhelmise can't beat Registeel and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Dhelmise to OHKO Zygarde-10% with Power Whip and 2HKO Virizion with Anchor Shot. 84 Speed EVs enable Dhelmise to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon like Registeel, Donphan, and Diancie. The remaining EVs are placed in HP and Defense to check threats like Virizion, Zygarde-10%, and Raikou more effectively. Colbur Berry allows Dhelmise to take a Dark-type move such as Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse better as well as weaken Knock Off or Pursuit from Pokemon like Donphan, Machamp, and Drapion. If running Steelium Z, Dhelmise can OHKO Virizion from full with Corkscrew Crash. Optionally, Dhelmise can use 100 Attack EVs to ensure that it OHKOes Noivern from full with Corkscrew Crash. However, without Colbur Berry, Dhelmise is more easily Pursuit trapped and KOed by strong Dark-type moves like Dark Pulse from Mega Blastoise and Pangoro.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dhelmise should be brought in on Stealth Rock setters and Pokemon that can't threaten it such as Rhyperior, Registeel, and Virizion. These are matchups where Dhelmise can easily use Rapid Spin to clear the field of entry hazards, if needed. Keep in mind that every Pokemon can be brought into Rapid Spin due to its lack of power. Thus, in some cases, it can be better to predict a switch with Power Whip or Anchor Shot. Anchor Shot is a good move in general because it can trap the opposing Pokemon and prevent a double switch. If the opponent has Bronzong, Registeel, or Forretress without Volt Switch as their Stealth Rock setter, try to trap it with Anchor Shot and stall its PP out. If using Rest, Dhelmise can be used as a status absorber for the team. However, keep in mind that Dhelmise will be forced to sleep for two turns, which allows various Pokemon to take advantage of it, especially setup sweepers like Barbaracle, Necrozma, and Toxicroak. If using Synthesis, Dhelmise can check physical threats like Virizion and Zygarde-10% more effectively as well as pivot into resisted or weak hits like Leaf Storm from Mega Sceptile and Roserade or Moonblast from Florges. However, without Rest, Dhelmise is unable to beat Registeel and Bronzong and can't be used as a status absorber for the team. Dhelmise should also avoid switching into a potential Scald from a Water-type like Slowbro or Milotic. Steelium Z allows Dhelmise to use Corkscrew Crash in order to KO Pokemon that can usually take a hit from it like Noivern and Bewear. In case of softer checks like Noivern, try to use the Z-Move on their switch to KO them. Bulky Pokemon like Bewear will need to be chipped before Dhelmise can KO them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dhelmise fits best on balance and bulky offensive teams because it is able to compress the role of entry hazard control and act as a check to common threats like Virizion, Zygarde-10%, and Raikou, which is very valuable for these archetypes. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Ninetales, Salazzle, and Noivern, appreciate Dhelmise's ability to act as a reliable spinner. They also take advantage of its ability to switch into strong attacks for them. Entry hazard setters like Golisopod and Dragalge or just Stealth Rock setters in general like Nidoqueen, Bronzong, and Diancie appreciate that Dhelmise can spinblock foes like Forretress, Tsareena, and Donphan. They also like that Dhelmise doesn't clear their own entry hazards away with Defog. Wish support from Pokemon like Florges and Vaporeon is very helpful so that Dhelmise is not always forced to recover up with Rest. Both of them can also support Dhelmise with Heal Bell. Water-types like Slowbro, Mantine, and Gastrodon are in general very good teammates because they can switch into Fire- and Ice-types moves. Dhelmise, in return, can switch into Grass- and Electric-types moves for them. Pokemon like Bewear, Florges, and Diancie are capable of checking Dark-types like Drapion and Mandibuzz and can switch into Knock Off from opposing Pokemon. Diancie can also switch into Flying-types like Noivern and supports Dhelmise with Heal Bell. Hariyama deserves a special mention, as it can check Dark-types while also providing a Fire- and Ice-type resistance with Thick Fat. Last but not least, since Dhelmise is not a check to Mega Blastoise, it's important to have a Pokemon that can switch into Mega Blastoise's attacks such as Florges, Gastrodon, and Hariyama.</p>"

  "Necrozma": {
    "overview": "<p>With solid stats across the board backed up by Prism Armor, a lethal signature move in Photon Geyser, Calm Mind to boost its high Special Attack, and Heat Wave to nail Steel-types, Necrozma is a premier wallbreaker in RU. Its flagship set, the Calm Mind sweeper, is capable of punching large holes early-game and can blow past teams once its checks have been sufficiently dealt with. Necrozma is also capable of running an offensive Stealth Rock set that capitalizes on its great matchups against Donphan and every offensive Defogger in the tier, and it has methods of circumventing the entry hazard removers it can struggle against, such as Psychium Z for Mega Blastoise and Toxic for Mandibuzz. However, the Stealth Rock set faces competition from Metagross, which has a Steel / Psychic typing and an incredible physical movepool, and Nidoqueen, which can threaten a wider variety of Pokemon with its powerful STAB and coverage moves. Necrozma's base Speed of 79 is great, allowing it to get the jump on Mega Blastoise and Nidoqueen, but being unable to outspeed Drapion, Gardevoir, and Goodra can be problematic at times. Necrozma faces competition as a Psychic-type Calm Mind user with Sigilyph and Espeon, which can't be hit by Toxic, and Cresselia, which is weaker but far bulkier. However, Necrozma's great combination of power, bulk, and Speed make it more well-rounded than these options, so it is the primary choice for teams looking for a Psychic-type Calm Mind user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky EV spread utilizing greater investment in defenses with Toxic and Knock Off can be used, as this set can be difficult for many teams to play around, albeit at the cost of much wallbreaking power. A physically based Swords Dance set with Buginium Z can be used to surprise the bulky Psychic-types that check most Necrozma, like Cresselia and Slowbro, but falls short in practice due to how easily it can be walled by Mandibuzz. An EV spread of 172 HP / 84 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to survive a Choice Band Golisopod's First Impression from full HP while retaining the aforementioned Speed benchmarks at the cost of some power. If said Speed benchmarks are unnecessary, an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD with a Modest nature can be used. A spread of maximum HP and maximum Speed can also be used to combine greater bulk and the ability to outpace sub-base 79 Speed Pokemon, but the drop in power is noticeable. The Calm Mind set can run Power Gem over Moonlight on more fast-paced offense that can't afford to be stopped by Mandibuzz or Houndoom, but the lack of recovery seriously hurts Necrozma, as a Z-Crystal is needed for wallbreaking, so pinch Berries can't be used. Calm Mind or Toxic can be used over Moonlight on the Stealth Rock set to put more pressure on bulky walls, but forgoing Moonlight can cause Necrozma to be stretched too thinly at times. Protect can be used to scout for Choice-locked revenge killers and coverage moves and to avoid being hit by Golisopod's First Impression, but Necrozma usually cannot afford to drop one of its other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Cresselia, Slowbro, and Slowking care very little about either Photon Geyser or Heat Wave, fearing only Toxic from the Stealth Rock set. In return, they can use Toxic on Necrozma in return or use it as setup fodder if carrying Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Mandibuzz, Houndoom, and Drapion all pose a huge threat to Necrozma, as they are able to either wall it, deal huge amounts of damage to it with their STAB attacks, or both. Houndoom deserves a special mention, as it's immune to both Heat Wave and Photon Geyser.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Necrozma absolutely despises Toxic, as it limits its staying power and it has no way to block the move. Entry hazards can also cause issues, as they push Necrozma into KO range of certain attacks or can force it to use Moonlight, losing some momentum.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Florges and Snorlax can take even boosted hits from Necrozma and proceed to either use Toxic on it or use it as an opportunity to set up Curse, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers like Choice Scarf Tyrantrum and Golisopod can revenge kill Necrozma or force it out with their powerful attacks even after it accumulates multiple Calm Mind boosts. Priority attacks like Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and Honchkrow and Bullet Punch from Metagross can threaten to KO a weakened Necrozma.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Photon Geyser is Necrozma's primary STAB move, dealing massive damage to any foe not resistant or immune to it after a boost. It also bypasses abilities, most notably OHKOing standard Donphan through Sturdy at +1. Heat Wave hits Steel-types that resist Photon Geyser, notably Forretress, Bronzong, Registeel, and Metagross. Calm Mind beefs up Necrozma's Special Defense and jacks up the power of Photon Geyser to incredible levels. Moonlight is used to let Necrozma stay healthy and set up multiple Calm Mind boosts against special attackers or weak physical attackers that can't 2HKO it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed threats such as Mega Blastoise, Nidoqueen, Bewear, and Machamp. Firium Z powers up Heat Wave into a one-time Inferno Overdrive to blow past Steel-types that could otherwise take a hit and use Toxic on Necrozma. It also has the nice property of not being able to be removed by Knock Off, meaning Necrozma won't take additional damage from the move as it attempts to set up. Psychium Z can also be used to turn Photon Geyser into Shattered Psyche to blow past dedicated special walls like Florges, but Necrozma gives up the Steel-melting prowess of Firium Z. Prism Armor is Necrozma's only ability and eases its setup against Pokemon with super effective coverage like Mega Blastoise. It also notably allows Necrozma to survive Insect Plate Golisopod's First Impression from full HP and OHKO it back after a boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Necrozma can be brought in against Pokemon that it can force out, such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, Noivern, and Raikou, and proceed to set up Calm Mind. Double switching to bring it in can also be effective to preserve Necrozma's health. Necrozma can either be used early-game to set up and break holes in the opposing team or be preserved until mid- or late-game to set up and sweep once its checks have been weakened or removed. Moonlight and Photon Geyser only have 8 PP each, so they should only be used when necessary to heal or secure KOs. Heat Wave is a safe move to throw out that doesn't burn down the PP of Photon Geyser and can be powered up into Inferno Overdrive to beat Pokemon that could otherwise take Heat Wave or Photon Geyser and use Toxic on Necrozma in return, namely Steel-types like Metagross, Registeel, and Bronzong. Opposing Toxic users should be weakened to the point where Necrozma can easily remove them with one of its attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Necrozma struggles against Dark-types, Pokemon that can handle them like Fairy- and Fighting-types work well with it. Florges can provide cleric support and threaten Mandibuzz, Honchkrow, and Houndoom with Moonblast. Florges also appreciates Necrozma's ability to handle Steel-types. Hariyama can take on Houndoom comfortably as well. Pokemon that can threaten bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Cresselia, and opposing Necrozma, like Golisopod and Escavalier, make for good teammates. Alternatively, teammates that can use Toxic on them to whittle their health away work as well. Necrozma appreciates entry hazard support in order to put checks like Florges and Snorlax into KO range, so Stealth Rock and Spikes support from the likes of Nidoqueen, Registeel, and Roserade is welcome. Pokemon that appreciate Steel-, Fighting-, and Poison-types removed, such as Mega Sceptile, Snorlax, and Shaymin, greatly appreciate Necrozma's ability to deal with them. Noivern is a great partner because of its ability to scare off Golisopod as well as bring Necrozma in with a U-turn.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Photon Geyser serves as Necrozma's obligatory STAB move, giving it a way of dealing good damage against most neutral targets outside of dedicated special walls. Heat Wave is nigh-essential coverage to not be walled by Steel-types like Metagross and Forretress. However, if said Steel-types can be comfortably handled by Necrozma's team, Knock Off can be run over it to soften them up. Moonlight lets Necrozma stay healthy against potential entry hazard removers that cannot 2HKO it so it can continue to lay Stealth Rock against their team. Power Gem can also be used for a stronger immediate hit on Mandibuzz and Houndoom, both of which can beat Necrozma otherwise. If more PP for healing is desired, Recycle can be substituted in over Moonlight at the cost of being somewhat less reliable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed Mega Blastoise and Nidoqueen. Psychium Z is used to land significant damage on entry hazard removers like Mega Blastoise, as well as providing a stronger hit to break through neutral targets that might otherwise survive a Photon Geyser, like maximum HP Donphan, Defog Flygon, and Noivern. If Moonlight is not being used, Wiki Berry can instead be run to give Necrozma a one-time restoration of its health. However, Wiki Berry is mandatory if running Recycle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- or mid-game is where this variant of Necrozma shines, being able to dent opposing Pokemon with its STAB and coverage moves as well as set up Stealth Rock. Bring Necrozma in on Pokemon that don't directly threaten it like Gardevoir, Roserade, and Virizion, and set Stealth Rock. Necrozma can use Toxic against walls it can't directly threaten, so don't be afraid to throw out the move liberally and catch switch-ins like Slowbro off guard. Keeping Necrozma away from Toxic is paramount, as bad poison damage slices into its longevity and can force it to use its Berry or burn Moonlight's PP unnecessarily. If Necrozma is carrying Wiki Berry instead of Psychium Z, keep it away from Pokemon that commonly carry Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are weak to Fighting like Tyrantrum and Curse Snorlax appreciate Necrozma's ability to scare away Machamp, Bewear, and Virizion; the latter is an especially notable teammate to partner with this Necrozma, as it greatly appreciates both Fighting-types being dealt with and Stealth Rock being set up to bolster its sweep. In return, Snorlax can switch into Toxic for Necrozma if it's a Rest or Immunity variant. Necrozma struggles to break through Dark-types and is highly susceptible to their attacks. Machamp, Virizion, and Bewear work well as teammates to break down these Pokemon. They can also pressure Registeel and Bronzong, which are bulky enough to take even boosted Heat Wave and use Toxic on Necrozma back. Setup sweepers such as Raikou, Barbaracle, and Toxicroak appreciate Stealth Rock being up and fit well on the balanced offense teams this set often finds itself on. Roserade makes for an excellent partner as well, as it is able to set up Spikes to add to Necrozma's offensive pressure and enjoys Steel-types being weakened or removed.</p>"
