  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is equipped with an incredible STAB combination that is amplified by its ability Sheer Force and a Life Orb, allowing it to operate as a powerful special wallbreaker despite its mediocre base Special Attack. In addition, it boasts phenomenal coverage options such as Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt that allow it to reliably pressure switch-ins to its STAB attacks such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, Slowking, and Landorus-T. Nidoking's defensive typing is solid as well, letting it take advantage of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Clefable for wallbreaking opportunities as well as providing it with a handy Toxic and Thunder Wave immunity. However, its bulk and Speed tier leave much to be desired. It is very prone to being revenge killed by faster threats like offensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele and struggles to find natural wallbreaking opportunities due to its frailty, relying on pivoting allies that can switch it in safely. Despite its good defensive typing, Nidoking's fragility also makes it difficult to utilize consistently, especially if it sustains prior chip damage. On top of this, Nidoking is reliant on its item to do damage due to its mediocre Special Attack, making it susceptible to Knock Off. This can be particularly troublesome against Clefable, which Nidoking can otherwise take advantage of. Special walls such as Blissey and Slowking are problematic as well, having no qualms switching into most of its attacks and gaining momentum on its escape with Teleport.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt allows Nidoking to exploit its small subset of switch-ins by incapacitating most forms of progress, such as Teleport and entry hazard removal, or hazard setup. Taunt mainly punishes Blissey, greatly limiting its utility and providing the Nidoking user with an opportunity to capitalize on it. However, Taunt is a move that needs to be used aggressively to get value, which can conflict with Nidoking's role as a wallbreaker. Alternatively, Focus Punch can be used for the luring and dispatching of Blissey, putting it in range of a subsequent STAB move. This can open Nidoking for more wallbreaking opportunities against teams that are overreliant on Blissey as their special backbone; however, Focus Punch is extremely matchup reliant and has little to no utility against other Pokemon. Lastly, Stealth Rock can be used on teams lacking a Stealth Rock setter, enabling Nidoking to set the hazard on forced switches. Though, using the move limits Nidoking's wallbreaking potential greatly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Nidoking is extremely susceptible to revenge killing from a wide range of offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R that can take advantage of its mediocre bulk and Speed tier to force it out and create progress with options such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T and Garchomp can scare out Nidoking with their greater Speed and super effective STAB attacks. Landorus-T, particularly, is not bothered by Nidoking's STAB attacks but can easily be overwhelmed by its coverage if utilized recklessly. Gastrodon and Swampert, additionally, are willing to take on Nidoking and scare it out with their respective STAB moves; the latter, however, can also be overwhelmed due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Blissey is a counter to most Nidoking variants that can reliably switch into any one of its special attacks, being only somewhat deterred by Taunt and the situational Focus Punch. Galarian Slowking, Slowking, and Tyranitar are also capable of taking its hits if healthy.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Nidoking is reliant on its Life Orb for its damage output; for this reason, Nidoking losing its Life Orb to Knock Off or Trick greatly mitigates the threat of its power. Additionally, given Knock Off's prevalence, Nidoking's susceptibility to the move allows Knock Off users to safely force progress using it against the Nidoking user's team.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Flamethrower reliably OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor and can apply pressure to Corviknight. Ice Beam targets Landorus-T, Garchomp, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T. Thunderbolt is an alternative to threaten super effective damage on Slowking. Thunder applies much more pressure to Slowking and OHKOes Tornadus-T as they switch in at the cost of a lower accuracy; however, a Modest nature is necessary if Thunder is used to create a more favorable roll to KO Slowking with a subsequent Sludge Wave. Substitute is another option that lets Nidoking fully capitalize on a forced switch and safely force damage on a target of its choice without the threat of being knocked out beforehand, which greatly eases the need for prediction, but forces Nidoking to drop an additional coverage option. A Modest nature provides the Nidoking user with a more fruitful damage output and a much more favorable roll to 2HKO Slowking with Thunderbolt. However, Timid allows Nidoking to outspeed Tapu Bulu, Modest Tapu Lele, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Nidoking's inability to find many natural wallbreaking opportunities makes it a phenomenal partner with offensive pivots such as Tapu Koko and Dragapult that can provide it with opportunities to switch in safely. The former is able to apply great pressure to checks like Corviknight and Slowking while pivoting against bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn; its Electric Terrain, additionally, boosts Nidoking's Thunderbolt, which is prominent against Slowking. The latter pivots against bulky Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable while applying pressure to Slowking with its Ghost-type STAB attacks. Additionally, it is capable of utilizing Thunder Wave to slow down Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, turning them into wallbreaking fodder for Nidoking. Nidoking also pairs well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which give Nidoking a safe wallbreaking opportunity against Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Grass-types like Tangrowth. They, additionally, can give Nidoking a good escape option against potential revenge killers like Tapu Lele for Corviknight and Landorus-T in Rotom-W's case. Slowking can also find good pivoting opportunities against Tapu Koko and Tangrowth while giving Nidoking the ability to exploit Toxapex for a wallbreaking opportunity. In addition, entry hazards and Knock Off are valuable tools that can greatly aid Nidoking's wallbreaking abilities by forcing checks like Slowking and Landorus-T to fold to its coverage. Ferrothorn, for example, boasts access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off to remove Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots and more effectively pressure it. Landorus-T is also capable of using Stealth Rock and Knock Off, as well as pivoting against opposing Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini with U-turn and providing Nidoking with a wallbreaking opportunity. Clefable is also a solid Stealth Rock setter that has access to Knock Off.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable, blessed with being born in RBY, has access to an expansive toolbox of support options in addition to a good defensive typing and two excellent defensive abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware. Its wide movepool allows it to function as an entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock, spread status with Thunder Wave or Toxic, hinder opposing Pokemon with Knock Off, and even run an offensive set with coverage moves like Flamethrower and Thunderbolt. This versatility makes Clefable a great addition to most team archetypes, letting it support offensive teammates with utility sets, wall setup sweepers with Unaware, or act as a special attacking setup sweeper with an offensive Calm Mind set. However, despite all of the attributes that make Clefable such a great addition to many teams, it suffers from middling defensive stats and can get overwhelmed by particularly strong attackers, requiring other bulky teammates to be the ones primarily taking hits and potentially struggling against offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable can make use of Magic Guard to run a Trick + Sticky Barb set to effectively impair opposing Pokemon, especially opposing walls, but should be wary of accidentally taking a Choice item or Assault Vest with Trick, ruining its defensive sets. Toxic is an alternative to Thunder Wave that can put opposing Pokemon on a timer, but since Clefable's most common checks are immune to Toxic, Thunder Wave is generally more effective. Clefable has access to Wish and Teleport, but its middling bulk makes it a subpar Wish passer, and a Wish + Protect set eats into Clefable's already limited moveslots. Encore can be used to lock foes into a move, allowing Clefable to set up entry hazards or a teammate to safely switch in. Healing Wish can be used to give offensive teammates like Dragonite and Volcarona a second life. Clefable can run a specially defensive EV spread to easily check Dragapult and offensive Zapdos variants, but this comes at the cost of being more vulnerable to strong physical attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If not running Flamethrower or Thunderbolt, Clefable is easily checked by Steel-types like Melmetal, Excadrill, Scizor, and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Galarian Slowking, Nidoking, and Nihilego easily switch into Clefable, although they generally don't like taking Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Between its Steel / Fire typing and Flash Fire, Heatran checks just about every Clefable variant, with specially defensive variants even taking very little damage from Thunderbolt, though it has to be careful of Thunder Wave and risks being PP stalled out of Magma Storms between their poor accuracy and the chance of full paralysis.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Clefable is an excellent utility Pokemon thanks to its access to a number of support moves combined with Magic Guard, which grants it incredible longevity when paired with Soft-Boiled's instant recovery, since it can't be worn down by passive damage. Moonblast allows it to threaten a number of common offensive threats, such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Urshifu-R. Knock Off helps Clefable's teammates make progress by removing items like Leftovers from Heatran and Melmetal and Assault Vest from Galarian Slowking, scaring away potential switch-ins that need their items to check certain threats. Clefable is also a good Stealth Rock setter, with decent matchups against a number of entry hazard removers like Tornadus-T that allow it to safely set up entry hazards. Thunder Wave can be run over either of these moves to hinder Clefable switch-ins like Melmetal and Heatran so its teammates can handle them more easily. Leftovers is used to allow Clefable to passively recover health, while Rocky Helmet can be run instead to punish physical attackers like Weavile and Buzzwole as well as Pokemon like Landorus-T and Corviknight using U-turn to pivot out against it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefable fits well on nearly any team structure, providing support for attackers on offensive teams and leveraging its good defensive typing and ability to switch into offensive threats on defensive teams, as well as offering its ability to act as a Knock Off absorber since it isn't as reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots as other walls. Utility Clefable is a generally passive Pokemon and struggles against walls like Slowbro and Blissey, so it pairs well with offensive teammates like Weavile and Choice Band Tyranitar that can remove them while benefitting from Clefable's ability to check Fighting-types and slow down opposing offensive Pokemon. Steel-types like Melmetal and Kartana easily threaten Clefable, so checks like Skarmory, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn are appreciated. Clefable is also walled by Poison-types like Galarian Slowking, so Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T are necessary to take care of them while providing additional offensive pressure against Steel-types. Clefable can be overwhelmed by powerful special attackers like Choice Specs Tapu Lele, Volcanion, and Blacephalon, so special checks like Blissey, Gastrodon, and Heatran are welcome teammates. Melmetal helps Clefable against a number of threats, including Calm Mind sweepers like Tapu Koko and opposing Clefable as well as Galarian Slowking and Nihilego. Clefable can form an entry hazard-stacking core with Skarmory or Ferrothorn, which complement the pressure of Clefable's Stealth Rock with Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Unaware": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Clefable's combination of Calm Mind and Unaware gives it a pivotal role on stall teams that have a hard time dealing with common threats like Garchomp and Weavile. Unaware ignores foes' boosted stats from moves such as Swords Dance, which means Clefable can effectively check setup sweepers. Calm Mind should be set up on Pokémon that can not deal notable damage to Clefable such as Corviknight, Slowbro and opposing Clefable in order for Clefable to act as a threat. Clefable should heal regularly with Soft-Boiled when attempting to wall the set up sweepers it is meant to handle since even when fully invested Clefable has to respect critical hits and high rolls from opposing sweepers. Aromatherapy is often slotted to ensure Clefable can clear away status conditions like poison, paralysis and burns on itself while also removing status conditions from its teammates. Flamethrower is an alternative to Aromatherapy so Clefable can threaten Steel-types like Melmetal, Corviknight and Ferrothorn if that is more necessary than being a cleric. The choice between Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots ends up mattering quite a lot in the matchups Clefable is supposed to take on, as an example Triple Axel from Weavile is a roll to 2HKO Heavy Duty Boots Clefable, while an Unaware Clefable with Leftovers is 3HKOed by Triple Axel. The added longevity and resilience from Leftovers is often preferred for this reason. Depending on team structure, Clefable might be forced to run Heavy-Duty Boots to ensure it can avoid taking damage from entry hazards if the team's hazard removal is not reliable. Clefable should be used to check setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Swords Dance Garchomp, Swords Dance Weavile, and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Maximum investment in Defense and HP ensures it can reliably take hits from these Pokemon, heal, and fire off Moonblasts or start setting up Calm Mind boosts. 12 EVs in Speed allow Clefable to outspeed uninvested Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is almost exclusively seen on stall teams that require a dedicated Unaware user to deal with setup sweepers such as the aforementioned Swords Dance Weavile and Garchomp, which stall teams otherwise struggle with. It also acts as a wincon for stall teams in longer games by being able to effectively set up Calm Mind. Corviknight is a good partner for Clefable, as it ends up checking threats that Clefable otherwise cannot handle such as Choice Band Rillaboom, Kartana, and Melmetal while also removing entry hazards with Defog. Another teammate that often ends up being paired with Unaware Clefable is Toxapex, which is a Regenerator user with Knock Off that can ensure Clefable can keep up its walling capabilities by removing items from threats such as Choice Band Kartana and Urshifu-R that could otherwise threaten to KO Clefable. Blissey can be paired with Unaware Clefable to check threats such as Choice Specs Volcanion, Dragapult, and Blacephalon that Unaware Clefable cannot switch into or effectively answer. Blissey can also use Heal Bell to give Clefable the option to run Flamethrower over Aromatherapy. Bulky Ground-types such as Gastrodon and specially defensive Hippowdon are good partners for Unaware Clefable since they are solid answers to the common stallbreaker Magma Storm Heatran, which could otherwise threaten to trap and KO Clefable.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Since Magic Guard ignores the passive damage from entry hazards and damaging status effects, Clefable can effectively set up Calm Mind on passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Slowbro. The choice of coverage on Calm Mind Clefable depends on what it wants to beat. Thunderbolt chunks and threatens Water-types like the aforementioned Toxapex while also threatening Flying-types like Corviknight and Tornadus-T. Thunder is sometimes chosen over Thunderbolt due to the high chance of paralysis threatening checks such as Heatran and the fact it stills allows Clefable to hit the aforementioned Water- and Flying-types. Using Flamethrower means that Clefable no longer threatens Water-types but can deal significant damage to Steel-types such as Melmetal and Ferrothorn. The choice between Life Orb and Leftovers is significant, as without the power boost from Life Orb, even Thunder Clefable will struggle to break through Toxapex, which can switch in and use Haze to remove Calm Mind boosts. If Leftovers is preferred, it is generally better to drop Thunderbolt for Flamethrower. 60 Speed EVs allow Clefable to outspeed uninvested Corviknight, while maximum investment in HP and Defense with a Bold nature maximizes bulk against threats such as Weavile and Garchomp, allowing Clefable to set up on them effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Clefable is a flexible wincon that often goes on teams centered around stacking entry hazards. Physically defensive hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory complement Calm Mind Clefable, since they check Pokemon like Melmetal and Kartana that could otherwise threaten to KO it while also putting down Spikes, which will wear down its switch-ins like Heatran and Melmetal. Ferrothorn in particular pairs well with Clefable; Clefable checks physical attackers that Ferrothorn can't deal with reliably such as Buzzwole, while Ferrothorn takes pressure off of Clefable by checking Tapu Koko and Galarian Slowking without Flamethrower. Ground-types like Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon are beneficial to Clefable, since they check threats such as Heatran and Victini. Hippowdon and Garchomp are also able to set Stealth Rock, wearing down Pokemon that switch into Calm Mind Clefable such as Galarian Slowking and Toxapex. Another Pokemon that pairs well with Clefable is Dragon Dance Dragonite, which checks threats like Rillaboom while also acting as another wincon that takes advantage of Spikes. Swords Dance Scizor is a good partner to Clefable because it can check threats like Tapu Lele while being a threatening sweeper in its own right. Calm Mind Clefable has a nasty tendency of being set up on by Volcarona, so offensive checks to Volcarona like Heatran and defensive checks like Toxapex are good partners to Clefable.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>With Teleport, Slowbro has found a new lease on life as one of the best defensive pivots in the tier with its combination of solid bulk, a strong defensive typing, and a fantastic ability in Regenerator. It stonewalls some of the metagame's top physical attackers in Urshifu-R and Melmetal and can turn them into entry points for frail attackers such as Blacephalon with Teleport, which is compounded by its STAB Future Sight that can blow through checks to its teammates. Colbur Berry + Body Press sets can also lure in and KO strong physical Dark-types like Weavile and Choice Band Tyranitar. However, Slowbro is greatly annoyed by Toxic putting it on a timer against Pokemon like Melmetal that it can otherwise sit on, does not appreciate U-turn spam from the likes of Urshifu-R, and is hamstrung by its lackluster Special Defense that makes it hapless against strong special attackers like Dragapult and Blacephalon, which is exacerbated by its subpar secondary typing in Psychic making it weak to the ever-spammable Shadow Ball. But as long as these shortcomings are accounted for, the Kantonian Hermit will gaze into the future and provide safe passage for its teammates with a consistency befitting its moniker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be run instead of Scald if Slowbro is the last line of defense against offensive threats that are weak to Ice like Garchomp, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Hawlucha. However, this makes Slowbro unable to check Victini and Excadrill, while physical attackers like Weavile, Tyranitar, bulky Swords Dance Rillaboom, and Crawdaunt can switch into it much more easily without the fear of a potential Scald burn. Thunder Wave or Toxic can be run over Slack Off to make Slowbro extremely difficult to switch into, but this is highly discouraged, as this makes Slowbro unable to sit on threats like Melmetal, and Regenerator alone is often insufficient to heal off the chip damage Slowbro accumulates over the course of the match from entry hazards, status, and U-turn. Rocky Helmet is an alternate item choice if Slowbro wishes to punish contact moves such as U-turn from Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos, but being vulnerable to entry hazards without the upside of removing Dark-types like the Colbur Berry + Body Press set is generally undesirable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Slowbro's secondary typing in Psychic leaves it vulnerable to Ghost-type attackers like Dragapult and Blacephalon, which is compounded by its subpar special bulk, as both are mainly special attackers. It should be noted that Blacephalon is greatly threatened by Scald if it tries to directly switch into Slowbro, while Dragapult generally dislikes taking chip damage from the move. Both also do not appreciate Slowbro immediately using Teleport to pivot out as they switch in, as their switch opportunities are already limited to begin with due to their susceptibility to passive damage from entry hazards, weather, and status conditions. Aegislash is a Ghost-type attacker that resists Future Sight and Stealth Rock due to its amazing typing while having the natural bulk to take Scald, but it is vulnerable to Slowbro using Teleport to bring in a wallbreaker as it switches in due to its lack of Speed.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Weavile, Tyranitar, Crawdaunt, and Bisharp threaten Slowbro, but they are greatly annoyed by Scald and get obliterated by Colbur Berry + Body Press variants, even though it should be noted that Beat Up Weavile can bypass Colbur Berry due to the move's multi-hit nature. Hydreigon holds the distinction of being a special attacker that preys on Slowbro's physical bias while also being the only notable Dark-type attacker that is not KOed by Body Press. Moreover, it resists Scald and has access to Roost, so it can easily heal off any chip damage incurred when switching into Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Outside of hitting Slowbro super effectively, Zapdos, Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zeraora can use Slowbro to gain momentum via Volt Switch or U-turn. While Zeraora does not like risking a Scald burn, Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W all have access to recovery moves that can heal off burn damage and do not mind their physical moves being weakened, as they are special attackers. Magnezone is another Electric-type that can threaten a KO on Slowbro with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt, but it dislikes taking Scald due to its low special bulk and lack of recovery and is weak to Body Press from Colbur Berry + Body Press Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Volcanion can overwhelm Slowbro even through resisted hits by taking advantage of its relatively low Special Defense for a defensive pivot. However, mixed variants of Slowbro can take hits from the two relatively well, so they can stay in and scout before switching out to keep themselves reasonably healthy with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Rillaboom and Kartana can KO Slowbro with their powerful Grass-type STAB moves. However, the threat of a Scald burn deters them from switching in often, and Scald deals considerable damage to Kartana due to its abysmal special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Slowbro can be reliant on Regenerator to stay healthy over long periods, so it despises any sort of residual damage that consistently eats into its recovery, as this can put it in range of attacks from Pokemon that it is supposed to check. The ubiquity of Knock Off and Toxic means that Slowbro can easily lose its Heavy-Duty Boots from Knock Off users that it often switches into, such as Toxapex and Clefable, or be put on a timer from Pokemon that it checks like Melmetal and Buzzwole if it is not careful. Slowbro variants not running Heavy-Duty Boots are especially susceptible, as they are vulnerable to entry hazard damage for the entire game. It should be noted that this issue is more prevalent in variants that forgo Slack Off, as Slowbro can use it to somewhat mitigate this issue in longer games.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Future Sight allows Slowbro to help wallbreaking teammates like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Choice Band Tyranitar break through their checks, such as Toxapex, Buzzwole, and Tapu Fini. It also provides Slowbro with a way of dealing considerable damage to Pokemon that often try to stay in on it for multiple turns, such as Tornadus-T and Clefable. Teleport is a mandatory move for this set, as it has incredible synergy with Regenerator and the aforementioned Future Sight, allowing Slowbro to heal off damage it takes when bringing in the aforementioned wallbreakers to exploit looming Future Sights. Slack Off keeps Slowbro healthy when Regenerator recovery is not sufficient. Scald is an amazing STAB move that deals hefty damage to Water-weak Pokemon that Slowbro checks, such as Victini, Landorus-T, and Excadrill, while threatening to burn physical attackers like Garchomp and Melmetal that Slowbro can tank multiple hits from. The threat of a burn also deters physical attackers that can KO Slowbro, such as Rillaboom and Kartana, from switching in even if they resist Scald. Body Press can be run in this moveslot if Slowbro is holding a Colbur Berry so it can lure in and remove physical Dark-types like Weavile and Choice Band Tyranitar, but Heavy-Duty Boots is generally preferred due to letting Slowbro ignore entry hazards and thus maximize its longevity. The EV spread above maximizes Slowbro's physical bulk, while 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature give it the slowest possible Teleport for matchups against opposing Slowbro and Slowking. Mixed EV spreads with Special Defense investment can be used so Slowbro can take hits from special attackers like Volcanion and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele while still retaining the physical bulk needed to check physical attackers, but it is recommended to keep Slowbro physically biased with a Relaxed nature, since Slowking outclasses it as a specially defensive pivot with its higher base Special Defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbro fits on bulky offense and balance teams looking for a defensive pivot that keeps up momentum and enables their offensive cores. Urshifu-R is an exemplary teammate, as Unseen Fist prevents teams from trying to stop Future Sight combinations with Protect, and its typing allows it to be a short-term check to Weavile and Tyranitar, Pokemon that greatly threaten Slowbro. In return, Slowbro can bring Urshifu-R safely onto the field with Teleport after setting Future Sight. The combination of Future Sight and Urshifu-R's own attacks on the same turn can be devastating for many of Urshifu-R's checks, such as Toxapex, Buzzwole, and Tapu Fini, paving the way for Urshifu-R to break through the opposing team. Other attackers that appreciate Teleport and Future Sight support like Weavile, Dragapult, and Blacephalon are also fantastic teammates for Slowbro. Teleport greatly improves their longevity, as it allows them to not take attacks while entering the field, while Future Sight helps them push through their checks: Dragapult and Blacephalon can overwhelm Hippowdon and Gastrodon with Future Sight support, and Weavile loves Future Sight obliterating its switch-ins, as it shares multiple checks with Urshifu-R, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Buzzwole. Weavile also comes with the benefit of resisting the Ghost-type attacks that Slowbro is terrified of, so it can act as an offensive check against the likes of Dragapult and Blacephalon. Choice Band Tyranitar is another Dark-type wallbreaker that takes great advantage of Future Sight to blow through its checks, but it sacrifices the utility of Knock Off and Weavile's blistering Speed tier for being an even sturdier check to Ghost-types with its incredible special bulk under sand. As mentioned above, Weavile and Tyranitar can let Urshifu-R enter the field, so they love Slowbro's ability to check it. As for defensive partners, sturdy Ground-types that can check Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Zeraora are mandatory, making specially defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp excellent teammates. In return, Slowbro can check offensive Water-types like Barraskewda and Urshifu-R. Steel-types make for great teammates: specially defensive Heatran is a sturdy Dragapult and Blacephalon check while forcing out Tapu Koko and Zapdos by leveraging its high special bulk and access to moves like Magma Storm, Earth Power, and Toxic; Melmetal can check both Weavile and Dragapult thanks to its mixed bulk and strong Double Iron Bash; and Ferrothorn is a great Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W check with its fantastic Steel / Grass typing. All of them appreciate Slowbro checking offensive Ground-types like Swords Dance Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, as well as Fighting-types like Urshifu-R, Buzzwole, and Blaziken. Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos are able to stave off offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana. It should be noted that both examples form pivoting cores with Slowbro via U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively, and Tornadus-T can also form a potent Regenerator core with it.</p>"

Choice Scarf gives Ditto the ability to outspeed any Pokemon that isn't running a Choice Scarf itself, or Pokemon like Hawlucha once Unburden has been activated. Ditto is able to duplicate the opposing Pokemon's base stats bar HP; hence, 252 HP is required in order to maximize Ditto's bulk. 252 SpA and Quiet nature increase the damage of Future Sight after copying a user such as Slowbro, as Future Sight damage will be calculated based on Ditto's SpA before transforming, should Ditto switch out. Against stall teams, Ditto should switch into Knock Off to get its Choice Scarf removed so it can switch moves and have effectively infinite PP as it switches out. This is especially useful against passive Pokemon with recovery like Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Quagsire, as it can increase its longevity throughout the game.</p> <p>Ditto functions best under bulky teams like stall that require support against offensive setup and opposing stall teams.

In return, Blissey can pivot out slowly with Teleport to provide free switch-in opportunities. Corviknight is a fantastic partner for its ability to remove entry hazards to keep Ditto healthy throughout the game and pivot out with U-turn to bring it in safely. Trick Clefable can help cripple entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Corviknight and other Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Toxapex is useful for dealing with defensive Calm Mind Pokemon like Clefable, which Ditto struggles against due to its Choice Scarf. If you opt to run Toxapex, having a Regenerator core from Pokemon like Reuniclus, Amoonguss, or Tangrowth can prove useful, allowing Ditto to better PP stall defensive Pokemon. Having wallbreakers to support Ditto against stall can benefit it greatly; Pokemon like Safeguard Volcarona, Substitute Kyurem, and Block + Transform Mew can prove useful, with the latter trapping Toxapex, which Ditto struggles to remove.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its neat type combination, useful ability in Static, and all-around fantastic stats, Zapdos is a premier Pokemon both offensively and defensively. Reliable recovery in Roost allows Zapdos to stay healthy in the long run so it can consistently come in on Pokemon multiple times in a game. Static is what makes Zapdos unique; it threatens contact attackers with a chance to paralyze them, which can cripple them for the rest of the match. Moves like Volt Switch to pivot out, Hurricane to hit hard with Flying-type STAB, Weather Ball in rain to hit Ground-types for super effective damage, and Heat Wave to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Melmetal make Zapdos a Pokemon that can offensively threaten almost every Pokemon in the metagame. Unfortunately, Zapdos is prone to getting hit by Knock Off from Pokemon it wants to switch into, such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Tornadus-T, which exploits its weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting how effectively it can check the aforementioned Pokemon. Common special walls like Blissey, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, specially defensive Tyranitar, and Gastrodon also prevent it from immediately breaking teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Discharge can be used on utility Zapdos over Volt Switch to cripple Ice Punch Dragonite and let it stay in on Toxapex and halve its health, unlike Volt Switch, which forces Zapdos off the field. Rocky Helmet can be used over Heavy-Duty Boots to punish contact attackers like Rillaboom, Melmetal, and Urshifu-R beyond Static's paralysis chance; however, this comes at the cost of taking Stealth Rock damage every time Zapdos switches in, which is not ideal, especially if it is running Defog. Stealth Rock puts Zapdos into 2HKO range of Pokemon like Protective Pads Urshifu-R and Choice Band Rillaboom and OHKO range of Dragapult's Draco Meteor and Weavile's Triple Axel. Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots can heal the chip damage Zapdos sustains throughout a match but suffers from the same problem Rocky Helmet does, with the only difference being more passive recovery instead of chipping down contact attackers. A spread of 248 HP / 220 Def / 40 Spe with a Timid nature can be run on utility sets to outspeed Adamant Rillaboom. The downside of running this spread is that Zapdos forgoes a substantial amount of bulk that may be needed to check other threats like Bisharp, Kartana, and Garchomp. Thunderbolt can be used on offensive variants over Volt Switch for more power, and Discharge can paralyze non-contact attackers, but both completely remove Zapdos's ability to function as a defensive pivot. On stall teams, Pressure can be used over Static to stall out Stealth Rock from entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Blissey so they run out of hazard PP before Zapdos runs out of Defog PP; however, this isn't optimal for more offensive teams, since such structures will rarely get into PP wars, and Corviknight generally pulls off this niche far more effectively. Choice Specs is a viable alternative to maximize Zapdos's breaking power, particularly on rain teams, but it comes at the cost of longevity, as without Heavy-Duty Boots to deny Stealth Rock damage or Roost to heal itself, Zapdos runs the risk of being quickly worn down. Substitute is an option when paired with Pressure to take advantage of passive threats that want to come in on Zapdos like Ferrothorn and Clefable, though it generally prefers its coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Weavile, Alolan Ninetales, and Arctozolt can greatly threaten Zapdos with powerful Ice-type attacks, but Weavile risks getting paralyzed from Static due to Triple Axel being a multi-hit contact move. Due to its frailty, Weavile is not a recommended switch-in. Other niche Ice-types like Mamoswine can also threaten Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as specially defensive Garchomp, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon are immune to Zapdos's Electric-type STAB moves and can take a Hurricane, allowing them to act as decent switch-ins to prevent Zapdos from gaining momentum. While Zapdos can use Toxic to limit their longevity, they can inflict Toxic right back onto Zapdos, while Gastrodon and Hippowdon can recover any chip damage taken from Hurricane. Moreover, specially defensive Garchomp can remove any progress Zapdos makes with its combination of Toxic to badly poison it, Protect to stall it out, and threatening it off the field to keep Stealth Rock up, not giving it opportunities to use Defog.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora are some of the only Pokemon that can resist Zapdos's STAB combination, allowing them to function as switch-ins. Zapdos takes neutral damage from Electric-type attacks and is outsped by both Pokemon, so they can serve as revenge killers if needed. Tapu Koko also has Roost to heal any damage it takes from Zapdos, with Calm Mind variants using it as setup fodder, and Zeraora's Volt Absorb blocks Volt Switch, as well as being able to force progress of its own with Knock Off or Toxic, which can heavily cripple Zapdos if it stays in. That being said, Tapu Koko and Zeraora are vulnerable to Toxic in return.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Blissey, Heatran, and Tyranitar can easily shrug off all of Zapdos's moves. If given a free turn, Blissey can heal any damage it has taken with Soft-Boiled, and Heatran can threaten Zapdos by trapping it with Magma Storm if it lacks Volt Switch. However, repeated Volt Switches can wear down Heatran and Tyranitar, since their only form of recovery is Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Zapdos usually gives room for strong special attackers like Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Tapu Lele to come in and threaten it and its teammates. Setup sweepers such as Meteor Beam Nihilego, Calm Mind Clefable, and bulky Quiver Dance Volcarona can use Zapdos as setup fodder, with Clefable and Volcarona beating utility Zapdos in particular due to its lack of Special Attack investment.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hurricane is Zapdos's Flying-type STAB move of choice, which lets it blow past the Grass- and Fighting-types it is assigned to check like Rillaboom, Buzzwole, and Kartana. Hurricane also weakens the Ground-types that prevent Zapdos from making progress like Garchomp and Landorus-T. Volt Switch gives Zapdos the ability to pivot out of bad matchups and gain momentum against walls like Blissey and especially Heatran and Tyranitar. Roost is Zapdos's main form of recovery and increases its longevity against Pokemon it needs to check over the course of a game. Defog allows it to remove entry hazards against hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Clefable due to their passivity against it and its serviceable bulk and longevity. Heat Wave can be used over Hurricane or Defog as an alternative that hits Steel-types like Melmetal, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage and OHKOes Kartana more reliably due to its better accuracy. However, running Heat Wave comes with some costs; without Hurricane, Zapdos is not able to properly threaten Garchomp, Blaziken, and Volcarona, and without Defog, entry hazard setters like Clefable and Landorus-T are free to set up Stealth Rock against it. Finally, Toxic is an alternate option that puts Ground-types that can otherwise outlast Zapdos such as Gastrodon and Hippowdon on a timer, limiting their ability to check Zapdos and its teammates over the course of a game. Toxic also poisons Electric-types like Tapu Koko and opposing Zapdos and, if running Heat Wave over Hurricane, allows Zapdos to not be completely passive against Garchomp and Landorus-T. Heavy-Duty Boots helps Zapdos avoid Stealth Rock damage completely, maintaining its longevity and making hazard removal a lot easier. Zapdos generally prefers running Static over Pressure to punish contact attackers with paralysis. The given spread allows it to outspeed base 70 Speed Pokemon like Modest Volcanion and Adamant Bisharp, with the remaining EVs invested in Defense to maximize its physical bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos fits on balance and bulky offense archetypes as a Defogger that can check various threats to these playstyles such as Tornadus-T, Melmetal, and Kartana. Garchomp is an amazing teammate for Zapdos, since it demolishes Zapdos's biggest checks in Blissey, Tyranitar, and Galarian Slowking and can go one-on-one against Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon with boosted Scale Shot so Zapdos has more freedom to pivot out with Volt Switch, as well as beating Electric-types like Zeraora and opposing Zapdos. Garchomp and Zapdos also provide solid Electric and Ground immunities to their teams. Rillaboom is another Pokemon that greatly benefits from Zapdos's partnership, since it helps beat the Ground-types Zapdos struggles with, while Zapdos helps Rillaboom out by beating the Flying-types that stand in its way like Tornadus-T and Corviknight, as well as non-Flying-type checks like Buzzwole and Ferrothorn. Urshifu-R benefits from checks like Slowbro, Buzzwole, Rillaboom, and Kartana all having very bad matchups against Zapdos, and Zapdos appreciates Urshifu-R being able to break through Ground-types like Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon, as well as special walls such as Blissey, specially defensive Heatran, and Tyranitar. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini appreciate Zapdos checking offensive Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom, which would otherwise be given free turns to make progress against them. In return, they are able to check Weavile for Zapdos. Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal love Zapdos's immunity to Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, and Zapdos appreciates Steel-types being able to check threats like Weavile, Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Tyranitar.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of Zapdos's incredibly powerful dual STAB combination in Thunder and Hurricane, which hits the vast majority of the metagame neutrally. Thunder is used over Thunderbolt because it never misses in the rain Zapdos combines its STAB moves with Weather Ball, which hits Heatran and Landorus-T super effectively and Zeraora and Tapu Koko neutrally, to have an incredibly threatening offensive presence. It doesn't just rely on its incredible wallbreaking power alone, however; with its great typing and ability, it can switch into Choice Scarf Kartana, Rillaboom, and Melmetal, threatening to paralyze them with Static and also OHKO the first two with Hurricane. Zapdos can reliably do this because Roost expands its longevity and Heavy-Duty Boots protects it from entry hazards that might assist the aforementioned Pokemon in breaking through. Zapdos uses a Timid nature to get the edge against powerful threats like Urshifu-R and Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is only meant for dedicated rain teams, so Pelipper is a must-have teammate, as it is able to provide crucial rain support as well as pivoting with U-turn. Barraskewda is a devastatingly fast cleaner that can wallbreak in tandem with Zapdos, and it additionally appreciates Zapdos striking fear into the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex, as Barraskewda can use Flip Turn against these foes to bring in Zapdos. Seismitoad is a similarly adept special wallbreaker that fits perfectly onto rain teams, and its Ground typing helps against the likes of Tapu Koko and Zeraora. Ferrothorn synergizes well rain due to its typing, and it can set entry hazards that are useful for chipping down Zapdos's revenge killers such as Choice Band Weavile and Choice Specs Dragapult. Other rain attackers like Urshifu-R, Volcanion, and Crawdaunt also fit nicely onto rain teams.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its amazing typing, defensive utility, solid Speed tier, and great coverage that can hit most of the metagame for at least neutral damage, Zapdos is a potent offensive pivot. Static is used to fish for paralysis, giving Zapdos a debilitating way to punish contact and pivot moves from Urshifu-R, Kartana, Melmetal, Rillaboom, and Tornadus-T, forcing progress by merely switching in. Heat Wave is used to incinerate switch-ins to Zapdos's STAB moves, notably Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. Toxic is used to put switch-ins like Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon on a timer, wearing them down as the game progresses. When dropping Hurricane, it should be noted that Zapdos lacks a way to directly pressure defensive Ground-types, so switch-ins to their attacks should be included on the team. This Zapdos set should be played cautiously, as it needs to be very healthy to effectively check the Grass- and Flying-types it's tasked with handling and also fears Knock Off from Rillaboom, Kartana, and Tornadus-T, which lets them chip it down with Stealth Rock by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Moreover, it's also afraid of Toxic from other Pokemon it pivots into, like Melmetal, Toxapex, and Buzzwole.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos fits best on offense and balance teams that call for its firepower and role compression, with its Volt Switch support, Static to punish common wallbreakers, and strong attacks letting it find a home on many teams. Excadrill is naturally a great partner with its ability to pressure Zapdos's answers like Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking and provide Rapid Spin support, which Zapdos appreciates if its Heavy-Duty Boots are removed by Knock Off. Zapdos, in return, provides Volt Switch support to dent common Excadrill answers like Slowbro, Corviknight, and Skarmory or bring Excadrill in to pressure its own answers like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Koko, all while eliminating other Excadrill checks such as Buzzwole, Ferrothorn, and Rillaboom with its coverage in Hurricane and Heat Wave and using Toxic to cripple Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp. Tyranitar is also a good teammate, as Volt Switch gives it many opportunities to hit the field safely and fire off powerful attacks, while it appreciates Zapdos answering Buzzwole and Ferrothorn and wearing down Landorus-T and Garchomp with Toxic. Zapdos also provides Volt Switch support to let Tyranitar come in on Zapdos checks like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. Slowbro is a solid defensive partner, as Zapdos neatly complements it thanks to handling Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom; in turn, Zapdos appreciates Slowbro's defensive prowess relieving much of the pressure put on it by powerful wallbreakers and offensive Ground-types, such as Urshifu-R, Victini, and Garchomp. Ferrothorn works well with Zapdos providing, Knock Off and Spikes support to force chip damage on Zapdos's switch-ins like Hippowdon and Garchomp. It's also a sturdy check to Weavile, Melmetal, and Tyranitar. In return, Zapdos checks Kartana, Buzzwole, and Urshifu-R and pressures Magnezone and opposing Ferrothorn. Heatran and Melmetal are effective partners thanks to their ability to check special attackers like Dragapult, opposing Zapdos, and Tapu Lele. Heatran in particular is a great partner due to Magma Storm's ability to trap and isolate Galarian Slowking and Blissey with the support of Taunt, opening up Zapdos. Heatran also baits in the aforementioned Ground-type Zapdos switch-ins and can poison them with Toxic. If running Flame Body, it can also fish for burns against Weavile. Melmetal is a great partner due to its bulk and typing allowing it to answer a myriad of Pokemon that pressure Zapdos, such as Weavile, Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Dragapult, all of which it also threatens with Double Iron Bash. Melmetal also lures in Ground-types that pester Zapdos like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Garchomp and afflicts them with Toxic. Weavile is a great partner thanks to how it benefits from Zapdos forcing out Skarmory, Corviknight, and Buzzwole, which all impede Weavile's ability to make progress, while also providing it with Volt Switch support. In return, Weavile is great for crippling Zapdos's checks like Clefable, Melmetal, and Heatran with Knock Off, denying them of the Leftovers they need to not be worn down by Volt Switch as the game progresses. Weavile also directly threatens specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Gastrodon, and Garchomp with its powerful Ice-type STAB moves. Powerful wallbreakers that can threaten special walls, like Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Kartana, are also great picks, as they enjoy Volt Switch denting their answers like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex, respectively. Finally, other consistent pivots go very well with Zapdos; Pokemon like Dragapult, Landorus-T, and Slowbro all fit this role well, forming pivot spam cores to safely invite wallbreakers such as Tyranitar, Urshifu-R, and Tapu Lele onto the field.</p>"

  "Zapdos-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Zapdos is an extremely powerful wallbreaker in OU, capable of taking the top off of most teams with its powerful STAB move combination of Brave Bird and Close Combat. Due to Defiant, Galarian Zapdos possesses the unique trait of threatening both Landorus-T and Corviknight's Defog with an Attack boost, which can nearly guarantee a KO. With even a +1 boost from Defiant, Galarian Zapdos threatens a KO on Corviknight with Close Combat, and with a +2 boost, Toxapex is OHKOed with Brave Bird. Furthermore, its access to U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to act as a strong pivot, as it forces many defensive Pokemon out such as Ferrothorn and Heatran along with slower offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R. U-turn also is a strong midground play against Slowbro, which is a common switch-in to Galarian Zapdos on Regenerator team structures. However, its powerful Brave Bird comes with the drawback of recoil damage, which, when compounded with passive damage caused by Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Stealth Rock, can greatly limit its staying power. On the other hand, locking into Close Combat also comes at a cost, as it gives Fighting-type answers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele a free switch-in.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band allows Galarian Zapdos to break through defensively oriented teams with its nearly unresisted STAB move combination of Brave Bird and Close Combat. Thunderous Kick is a middle ground option for breaking through Corviknight even as it heals that does not come with Close Combat's drawback of lowering Galarian Zapdos's defenses. Stomping Tantrum is another option that acts as a way of pressuring bulky Poison-types like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking without Brave Bird recoil while also hitting Tapu Koko on the switch and Aegislash super effectively. Drill Peck is another option for the third moveslot that gives Galarian Zapdos more staying power than using Brave Bird constantly and is good for picking off weakened enemies. U-turn is helpful for generating momentum against healthy Regenerator cores and scouting if locking into Brave Bird or Close Combat is not desirable.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos fits best on offensively oriented teams due to its incredible breaking power and ability to build momentum. Pivots like Dragapult and Tapu Fini help Galarian Zapdos get on the field safely while chipping away at foes health to allow Galarian Zapdos to more easily wallbreak. Tornadus-T, particularly Assault Vest variants, is an excellent pivot that pairs well with Galarian Zapdos, as it is able to both spam Knock Off and eat most hits that would otherwise KO Galarian Zapdos. Entry hazard support helps Galarian Zapdos secure easier KOes against bulkier foes and bait the opponent into activating Defiant with Defog, so teammates such as Spikes Ferrothorn and Stealth Rock Landorus-T are good choices. Ferrothorn can more easily chip away at foes with Knock Off and Leech Seed, while Landorus-T can come in on Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora that threaten Galarian Zapdos. Landorus-T can also utilize Toxic to wear down some of Galarian Zapdos's checks like Zapdos and Slowbro. Pairing Galarian Zapdos with another physical wallbreaker like Weavile or Melmetal is suggested, as together they can break through each other's checks. Both Weavile and Melmetal appreciate Galarian Zapdos's ability to deter Defog due to Defiant and blast through defensive walls like Ferrothorn and Toxapex with Brave Bird, while Galarian Zapdos appreciates Weavile removing Toxapex and Clefable's items with Knock Off and Melmetal's ability to both switch into Fairy-type attacks and spread status to bulky Flying-types like Corviknight and Zapdos. Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora are excellent choices as teammates as they can bait in Landorus-T, activating Defiant on a double switch. Tapu Koko particularly appreciates Galarian Zapdos beating Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking, while Magnezone comes with the added benefit of trapping Corviknight and Skarmory with Magnet Pull, allowing Galarian Zapdos to more freely use Brave Bird. Future Sight users like Slowbro and Galarian Slowking allow Galarian Zapdos to more easily break through physical walls like Toxapex and Corviknight. Slowbro deserves special mention for its ability to safely pivot Galarian Zapdos in with Teleport against Ferrothorn and Rillaboom.</p>"

Dragonite's endless amount of coverage moves allow it to hit Pokemon that can otherwise check it, like Landorus-T and Zapdos. Dragonite's Dragon / Flying typing also allows it to switch in on many different Pokemon, such as Blacephalon, Blaziken, Urshifu-R, Heatran, and Rillaboom while also being able to use Roost to check them long-term. However, Dragonite is weak to Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Lele, and Dragapult, as Weavile can easily OHKO it with Triple Axel, whereas Tapu Lele and Dragapult can 2HKO it with Moonblast and Draco Meteor, respectively. Dragonite is also heavily reliant on its Heavy-Duty Boots to function properly, as it is weak to Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch can be used on Dragon Dance sets to threaten Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Skarmory, though Dragonite doesn't appreciate dropping any of its coverage moves or Roost. Defog can be used on utility Dragonite sets over Heal Bell to control entry hazards but doing this means that it can't function as a status switch-in or cure teammates of their status. This is in addition to the fact that it's a subpar Defogger, as it doesn't like being burned or poisoned, and it appreciates its Heavy-Duty Boots. Extreme Speed is an option on Dragon Dance sets to outspeed Weavile's Ice Shard and OHKO it at +2 on offensive Dragonite sets, though there aren't many other benefits to it. Red Card is a decent alternative to Heavy-Duty Boots on Dragon Dance sets, as it can force out defensive checks like Clefable in addition to offensive checks like Dragapult and Tapu Lele, though this means that Dragonite is forced to take Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Weavile is the single greatest offensive threat to Dragonite, as the second and third hits of Triple Axel ignore Multiscale and are able to OHKO any Dragonite set. Jolly Weavile also outspeeds +1 bulky Dragonite, making it quite difficult to sweep. Pokemon like Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Buzzwole run coverage moves like Ice Beam and Ice Punch to hit Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users like Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Kartana rid Dragonite of its Heavy-Duty Boots, making Multiscale useless if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and burn from Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Rotom-W are quite detrimental status effects for Dragon Dance Dragonite sets, as both remove the effects of Multiscale and can quickly wear it down. However, utility Dragonite does not have this issue, as it rids itself of status effects with Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Defensive Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini can take hits from Dragonite and hit it super effectively with Moonblast, whereas Tapu Fini can also burn it with Scald. Offensive Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele can threaten Dragonite with Dazzling Gleam and Moonblast, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Skarmory all wall Dragonite due to their massive Defense stat and can easily use Leech Seed and Roost, respectively, to stay healthy throughout the course of the battle. Their Steel typing also nullifies their weakness to Ice Punch, making it difficult for Dragonite to break through them. Corviknight and Skarmory can use Iron Defense to match Dragonite's attack boosts, making them nearly impossible to KO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Nidoking all outspeed Dragonite if it is unboosted. Dragapult and Hydreigon can threaten Dragonite with Draco Meteor, whereas Nidoking can threaten it with Ice Beam.</p>",

Dual Wingbeat deals solid damage to Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Blaziken, whereas Ice Punch hits would-be checks to Dragonite such as Zapdos and Landorus-T. Roost allows Dragonite to repeatably switch in to Pokemon like Kartana and Urshifu-R while also working well in conjunction with Multiscale. 160 Speed EVs are mainly used to allow Dragonite to outspeed utility Tornadus-T and Adamant Weavile at +1. 248 HP and 68 Defense EVs allow Dragonite to tank an unboosted Ice Shard from Jolly Weavile after Stealth Rock, whereas the 8 Special Defense EVs prevent it from getting 2HKOed by Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Blacephalon. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to improve Dragonite's offensive capabilities, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO targets like Utility Tornadus-T at +1.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonite heavily appreciates entry hazard setters, as they wear down Pokemon that check it like Slowbro and Tapu Fini and allow it to obtain more KOs.

Earthquake hits Toxapex, Melmetal, and non-Air Balloon Heatran. Dual Wingbeat is the best option versus physically defensive walls like Slowbro and Clefable in addition to OHKOing Buzzwole after Stealth Rock, while Ice Punch hits Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Garchomp. Roost increases Dragonite's longevity, allows it to set up in front of non-Iron Defense Corviknight and non-Gyro Ball variants of Ferrothorn, and also functions incredibly in combination with Multiscale.

Magic Guard Clefable is another incredible partner for Dragonite, as it can switch in to Knock Off, Scald, and Toxic from Toxapex, Slowbro, and Tornadus-T with ease while also using Knock Off to wear down Zapdos and Melmetal and Thunder Wave to cripple Weavile and Dragapult. Clefable also functions as a solid switch-in to Weavile, which Dragonite struggles against. Tapu Fini is another good teammate, because similar to Clefable, it can switch in to Weavile as well as Garchomp and Dragapult while also removing checks like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Slowbro with its Whirlpool set. Heatran threatens Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Skarmory, ability to wear down foes with Stealth Rock and Toxic, and ability to switch into Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Weavile. Similar to Heatran, Magnezone can trap and beat Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Skarmory thanks to Magnet Pull if any of them lack Shed Shell. Lastly, Landorus-T makes for a good partner thanks to its general utility in Defog to remove Steath Rock if Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed by Knock Off, Toxic to wear down foes, and Knock Off to rid Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Clefable of their items.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking's great typing, excellent ability in Regenerator, and special bulk make it one of the most reliable pivots and special walls in the metagame, and these traits with the combination of Future Sight and Teleport let it help its teammates to force progress against opposing teams. Regenerator allows Slowking to keep itself healthy, which helps it switch into threats more easily and gives it more opportunities to use Future Sight. With its great bulk and defensive typing, Slowking is able to check threatening specially offensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Nidoking, Tapu Lele, and Latios and use them as Future Sight fodders. However, Slowking is very vulnerable to physical wallbreakers like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as its physical bulk is mediocre and doesn't allow it to tank strong hits from them. Slowking's typing and mediocre physical bulk also leave it very vulnerable to Knock Off and U-turn. This is an issue, as these moves are very frequently run and often safe to use, further limiting Slowking's utility as a defensive pivot. In addition, Toxic is worrisome, as it forces Slowking to use Slack Off more often and limits its potential to consistently switch into dangerous Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is a great option to make Slowking a lure to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, but it comes at the opportunity cost of pressuring the opposing team with Future Sight. Thunder Wave is another good option to cripple threatening setup sweepers such as Hydreigon and Nasty Plot variants of Tornadus-T, but losing the utility of Future Sight for it is not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Common Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana threaten Slowking with their super effective STAB options. Ferrothorn is especially annoying, as it can use Slowking as Spikes fodder and it can dish out a strong Power Whip. However, all of them have to fear a possible burn by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Zeraora threaten Slowking with their respective STAB moves and can easily wear it down with pivoting moves. However, Zeraora can't risk switching into a Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Dragapult and Aegislash threaten Slowking with their strong STAB moves, but the former has to be wary of a Scald burn if it's running Dragon Darts.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Both Hydreigon and Mandibuzz threaten Slowking, as the former isn't scared by Scald and can use it as setup fodder, while the latter can threaten a Knock Off to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Physical wallbreakers such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Melmetal can all easily overwhelm Slowking. Landorus-T can easily pivot with U-turn on it or use Knock Off, Garchomp can dish out heavy damage with its STAB moves, and Melmetal can overwhelm it with coverage options. However, they must be wary of Scald's burn chance.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic is annoying for Slowking, as it limits its utility on the field by forcing more switches and uses of Slack Off. Although Slowking can normally check it, Heatran can lure in Slowking and cripple it with a debilitating Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Scald is a reliable STAB move and can severely punish potential checks such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Zeraora, and Ferrothorn with a burn if they attempt to hard switch into it. Future Sight pressures opposing teams and works well with Slowking's teammates to increase their wallbreaking potential and force progress. Slack Off lets Slowking stay healthy to reliably check special wallbreakers without having to rely on Teleport or switches. Teleport is not only a solid pivoting option, but it works well in tandem with Future Sight, as Slowking can bring in a more offensive teammate safely to capitalize on the Future Sight. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowking pivot in more freely without getting whittled down by entry hazards and helps to maintain healing from Regenerator. 0 Speed IVs with a Sassy nature allow for it to underspeed or Speed tie with opposing Slowking and Slowbro with Teleport.</p> <p>Slowking fits best on bulky offense and balance, as it is able to check dangerous Pokemon such as Heatran and Nidoking, which are threatening to those team archetypes, while being able to maintain momentum. A lot of offensive Pokemon appreciate the additional pressure of Future Sight as well as Slowking's ability to bring them in safely with Teleport. Garchomp likes having its defensive answers like Tangrowth and Landorus-T pressured by Future Sight, providing it with easier wallbreaking opportunities. Slowking is weak to strong physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Kartana, so switch-ins like Tangrowth and Mandibuzz make great partners; in return, Slowking checks problematic Pokemon such as Heatran for them. Dark- and Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Hydreigon can threaten Slowking, making Mandibuzz and Clefable effective partners. In return, Slowking can check Heatran, Tapu Lele, and Nidoking for them. Additionally, Clefable can capitalize on Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mandibuzz that Slowking pivots against. Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora are threatening, making defensive Landorus-T and Grass-types like Ferrothorn and the aforementioned Tangrowth good partners that can help keep them at bay. When pivoted into battle via Teleport, both Landorus-T and Ferrothorn can force progress with their own Knock Off or set their respective entry hazards. Furthermore, Slowking checks Tapu Lele, Heatran, and Nidoking for them in return.</p>"

  "Slowking-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Slowking is one of the best specially defensive pivots in the metagame. Its access to Regenerator, fantastic defensive typing, and special bulk allow it to consistently take hits from special attackers like Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, and Zapdos while threatening the aforementioned threats with its wonderful coverage backed up by a meaty Special Attack stat. It can also run multiple sets with this unique two-way profile; an Assault Vest boosts its Special Defense to astronomical levels, allowing it to even stay in on super effective special attacks like Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Dragapult and Blacephalon. Other sets use Nasty Plot to break through unsuspecting defensive cores expecting Assault Vest variants. However, the Galarian salamander is not without its flaws, as its low Speed means that it often takes multiple hits before moving. This is compounded by its tendency to not run Slack Off, making it vulnerable to being overwhelmed, especially against physical attackers like Melmetal and Urshifu-R taking advantage of its mediocre physical bulk. However, on the right team that can compensate for these shortcomings, Galarian Slowking can be a key defensive piece that has the offensive firepower to methodically force progress every time it hits the field.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Future Sight can be run over Psyshock on Nasty Plot sets if compressing the roles of a bulky wallbreaker and offense enabler is desired, but this is generally discouraged, as foregoing Psyshock makes Galarian Slowking unable to break through special walls like Blissey and Gastrodon. Nasty Plot Galarian Slowking can also run Slack Off to improve its longevity, but it generally prefers extra coverage or the disruptive power of Trick. Assault Vest sets can run even bulkier EV spreads to check Ghost-type attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult in a pinch, but Galarian Slowking will lack the firepower to reliably force out Pokemon like specially defensive Clefable and Toxapex. Earthquake is an option on Assault Vest sets to lure in and remove Heatran, but this is generally discouraged, as it does not have much utility outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Garchomp, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon have the bulk to take unboosted attacks from Galarian Slowking and can threaten it out with their strong STAB Earthquake. However, these Pokemon generally fear Scald, and Hippowdon and Gastrodon can get sniped by the rare Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Galarian Slowking's part-Psychic typing and mediocre physical bulk make it extremely vulnerable to Knock Off and Crunch from Weavile and Tyranitar, which can OHKO it. They are also immune to Psychic-type attacks, giving them potential switch-in opportunities against Galarian Slowking. However, Galarian Slowking can lure them with a Colbur Berry before retaliating with its coverage moves, and the threat of being burned by Scald on the switch can dissuade them from switching in. Hydreigon does not particularly mind being burned from Scald due to it being a special attacker and having access to Roost, but it is threatened by Ice Beam and struggles to OHKO Galarian Slowking through the latter's high special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: As Galarian Slowking has mediocre physical bulk, strong physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Melmetal can break through it with Surging Strikes and Double Iron Bash, respectively. However, they cannot easily switch into Galarian Slowking, as Urshifu-R fears Psyshock, while Melmetal dislikes taking Flamethrower or Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Aegislash can all threaten Galarian Slowking with their STAB moves. However, Dragapult and Blacephalon generally dislike taking attacks from Galarian Slowking due to their poor bulk, while Aegislash can be torched by Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran is one of Galarian Slowking's best checks in the metagame, as it doesn't mind most attacks and can trap and remove it with a combination of Magma Storm and Earth Power. However, variants carrying Scald, especially Nasty Plot sets, can turn the tables on Heatran if it recklessly comes in on Galarian Slowking.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Nasty Plot turns Galarian Slowking into an bulky wallbreaker that can punch holes in defensive cores after setting up on the myriad of switches it forces. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic, as it hits specially defensive walls like Blissey and Gastrodon harder, as well as giving it an advantage in boosting wars against Calm Mind users like Clefable and Tapu Fini. Flamethrower obliterates the likes of Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Melmetal that can otherwise switch into Galarian Slowking. Trick can be used instead if Galarian Slowking is holding Black Sludge, as Trick has immense disruptive potential by weakening switch-ins like Heatran and Melmetal with the passive damage of the item. Scald is a wonderful coverage move that not only hits the Ground-types that like switching into it, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon, but also threatens to cripple them with a burn. Additionally, the possibility of inflicting a burn dissuades powerful physical attackers that can force it out, such as Weavile and Tyranitar, from switching into it. Moreover, Scald threatens Heatran, which resists Galarian Slowking's STAB moves and is immune to Flamethrower if running Flash Fire. Ice Beam can be run over Scald if Galarian Slowking wishes to destroy the likes of Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Garchomp at the cost of being incredibly vulnerable to Heatran. Sludge Bomb is also an alternative to immediately threaten Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini, but it should be noted that Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T will be able to switch into Galarian Slowking a lot more easily while doing nothing to ease the Heatran matchup. Grass Knot is a niche coverage option that obliterates the likes of Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Gastrodon. However, it does fairly little outside of this, as other switch-ins like Heatran and Dragonite take minimal damage from the move. Heavy-Duty Boots is typically the item of choice, as Galarian Slowking greatly appreciates ignoring entry hazard damage to maximize Regenerator recovery, but Black Sludge can be run if Galarian Slowking wishes to be more of a disruptor with Trick while enjoying the passive recovery from the item. Resistance Berries are also viable options; a Colbur Berry allows Galarian Slowking to stay in on Dark-type attackers like Weavile and Tyranitar to threaten them with coverage, while a Shuca Berry is useful for stomaching attacks from Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill before retaliating with Scald or Ice Beam. The EV spread allows Galarian Slowking to outspeed Gastrodon, live Surging Strikes from Choice Band Urshifu-R, and take Shadow Ball from Timid Choice Specs Dragapult after Stealth Rock while maximizing Special Attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Galarian Slowking is a fantastic fit on bulkier structures that appreciate its defensive profile while also needing its offensive abilities to break through sturdy defensive cores. Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Corviknight, and Skarmory are mandatory teammates, as they are solid checks to Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Corviknight and Skarmory have the bonus of being able to come in on Dark-types like Weavile and Tyranitar, and Skarmory's Spikes can wear down grounded checks to Galarian Slowking, such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Gastrodon. Checks to Dark-types are also highly important; Buzzwole and Clefable can take Dark-type moves from Weavile and Tyranitar relatively well while threatening them with Close Combat and Moonblast, respectively, in return. The aforementioned Pokemon can keep other physical attackers that threaten Galarian Slowking at bay as well; Corviknight and Skarmory can stonewall threats like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Melmetal while Buzzwole and Clefable can help check the dangerous Urshifu-R. As Nasty Plot Galarian Slowking does not have the bulk investment of Assault Vest sets, sturdy special walls make for good teammates. Specially defensive Heatran is a fantastic check to Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Blacephalon and can wear down shared checks like Garchomp and Landorus-T with Magma Storm and Toxic. Gastrodon can shrug off most attacks from Heatran and Volcanion and stonewalls Electric-types that often use Galarian Slowking as Volt Switch fodder to pivot around, such as Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W. As for offensive teammates, Dragapult appreciates Galarian Slowking's ability to break past specially defensive walls like Gastrodon and Blissey with Psyshock, while Galarian Slowking enjoys the speed control and pivoting that Dragapult provides so it can find opportunities to wallbreak more easily. Rillaboom is a wonderful partner, as it weakens Earthquake with Grassy Surge and provides passive recovery for Galarian Slowking if it enters the field when Grassy Terrain is active, improving its longevity. Finally, Tapu Koko has fantastic synergy with Galarian Slowking; its access to Roost makes it a great offensive pivot on the defensive teams that Galarian Slowking often finds itself on, puts Ground-types that also check Galarian Slowking like Hippowdon and Garchomp on a timer with Toxic, and wears down Heatran with Volt Switch.</p>"

Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to generate progress by supporting wallbreaking teammates like Urshifu-R and Kartana against checks like Buzzwole and Toxapex, but Psychic is a viable alternative if Galarian Slowking desires to immediately threaten Pokemon like Toxapex and Urshifu-R. Sludge Bomb allows Galarian Slowking to threaten Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Lele, while Flamethrower hits Steel-types that resist Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, such as Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight. Scald is preferred in the final moveslot, as it rounds out Galarian Slowking's coverage by hitting Heatran and Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon while being difficult to switch into due to the threat of a burn; however, Ice Beam can be run instead if obliterating Pokemon like Garchomp is more important. The EV spread outspeeds Toxapex, allows Galarian Slowking to survive Surging Strikes from Choice Band Urshifu-R, and avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic. The rest is invested in Special Attack so Galarian Slowking can hit as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Assault Vest Galarian Slowking fits well on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to stave off strong special attackers while still supporting the team offensively with its good coverage and strong Special Attack. Wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Kartana are great offensive teammates that can take great advantage of Future Sight breaking through checks like Toxapex and Buzzwole. Weavile comes with the bonus of offensively pressuring Dragapult, which can force Galarian Slowking out with Shadow Ball. Rillaboom also benefits from Future Sight support against Zapdos and Tornadus-T while setting up Grassy Terrain to weaken Earthquake and provide passive recovery, improving Galarian Slowking's longevity. As Assault Vest Galarian Slowking is vulnerable to entry hazards, hazard removal is important to keep it healthy: Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos are premier Defoggers that can reliably clear away hazards while checking Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T. Physically defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Buzzwole can take on strong physical threats that take advantage of Galarian Slowking's poor physical bulk, such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Urshifu-R. In return, Clefable can disrupt shared switch-ins like Heatran with Knock Off and Thunder Wave, while Buzzwole can take advantage of Future Sight with its strong STAB Close Combat. Specially defensive Landorus-T and Gastrodon can check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Blacephalon that force Galarian Slowking out with their STAB moves, and Landorus-T has the bonus of checking Ground-types like Garchomp and Excadrill with Intimidate and its immunity to Ground-type attacks. Both Pokemon also block Volt Switch from Zapdos and Tapu Koko, which can pivot around Galarian Slowking to bring in threatening wallbreakers. Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal provide secondary Fairy-type checks, especially against Tapu Lele, since the latter can break through Galarian Slowking with Psyshock. Finally, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking dislikes losing its item, so Knock Off absorbers like Clefable and Skarmory pair well with it.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Skarmory's impressive physical bulk and great defensive typing allow it to blanket check most physical attackers in the tier, including Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rillaboom, Kartana, and Weavile. Skarmory differentiates itself from other physical walls by being one of the only viable Spikes setters in the tier, easily setting it because of the many switches it forces against the Pokemon it walls. This prevents it from being completely passive despite its poor offensive stats. Iron Defense in conjunction with Body Press can also turn it into a late-game wincon. However, Skarmory's terrible special bulk leaves it vulnerable to almost every special attack, including even resisted attacks from strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Skarmory faces competition from Ferrothorn and Mew as a Spikes setter, which have access to Knock Off and better special bulk to check Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Kyurem, as well as Corviknight and Buzzwole as a physically defensive wall, which have U-turn and actual offensive presence, respectively. Skarmory does, however, have access to reliable recovery and can consistently check Ground-types unlike Ferrothorn, as well as access to Spikes unlike Corviknight and Buzzwole.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Whirlwind can be used in the third moveslot to phaze setup sweepers and Pokemon that Skarmory does not want to face, like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Volcarona, if they try to switch into it. The switches it forces can wear down the opposing team in conjunction with Spikes. A Shed Shell allows Skarmory to escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull, which can annoy teams that rely on it to trap Skarmory to support Pokemon like Rillaboom and Kartana. However, Rocky Helmet is valuable, especially against U-turn users Skarmory can't punish without it, and Shed Shell can easily be removed by Knock Off if it pivots into one of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko and Zapdos do not mind anything except Toxic from Skarmory and can switch in and force it out, or remove Spikes with Defog in Zapdos's case. Zeraora dislikes switching into Body Press, leaving it reliant on pivots to switch in, but it also forces Skarmory out and can set up on it with Bulk Up. Magnezone is of particular note, as it traps Skarmory with Magnet Pull, though it must be wary of Body Press on the switch, and faster variants of Skarmory can outspeed and KO Magnezone with Body Press if it is weakened. Melmetal can potentially force in Skarmory and use Thunder Punch to weaken it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Volcarona and Victini can switch into Skarmory safely if it does not carry Toxic, and the former can use Skarmory as setup fodder if it does not carry Whirlwind. Heatran cannot switch in safely in fear of Body Press but can force Skarmory out. Garchomp, which Skarmory usually walls, occasionally uses a mixed set with Fire Blast in order to lure in and KO it. Galarian Slowking usually uses Flamethrower on its Assault Vest set.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Skarmory's low special bulk, almost every special attacker, like Hydreigon, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, is capable of threatening it out, though the former two take considerable damage from Body Press should they switch directly in. Pivots like Landorus-T that Skarmory wants to switch into can use U-turn to bring one of these special attackers safely in against it.</p>",

      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Body Press is the preferred attacking move, as it deals significant damage to most of the physical attackers Skarmory wants to check like Kartana, Excadrill, and Rillaboom, and it punishes Magnezone attempting to switch in and trap Skarmory. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to match boosts from setup sweepers like Swords Dance Weavile and Garchomp. Be careful when facing Kartana, however, as Sacred Sword bypasses Defense boosts. Iron Defense also boosts the power of Body Press, making Skarmory less passive and potentially able to sweep late-game if faster special attackers are removed. Toxic is an alternative to cripple some Pokemon that can otherwise switch into Skarmory like Zapdos, Volcarona, Tapu Koko, and Slowking, and it allows Skarmory to more consistently keep its Spikes up; it quickly puts most Defog users, with the exception of Corviknight, on a timer. However, it lets physical setup attackers overwhelm Skarmory in the short term. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to wear down physical attackers that make contact like Urshifu-R and Weavile. It is also particularly useful for deterring U-turn to gain momentum from the likes of Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Urshifu-R, forcing progress against them. At the cost of considerable bulk, 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Modest Magnezone so that Skarmory can 2HKO it with Body Press if it is weakened or caught on the switch.</p> <p>Many offensive Pokemon can benefit from Skarmory's Spikes punishing the switches they force and wearing down checks, like Bisharp, Weavile, Zeraora, and Dragapult. Bisharp and Weavile are particularly notable for their powerful Knock Offs, which can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to wear them down further with Spikes, and the former can deter Defog thanks to Defiant while utilizing Assurance to take advantage of Spikes. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp can check Electric-types for Skarmory. Skarmory usually draws in special attackers, making special walls that can check them for it ideal teammates. For example, Blissey is a good check to Dragapult and Hydreigon, Slowking checks Heatran and Tapu Lele, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking covers Kyurem and Tapu Koko. Skarmory's Spikes prevents U-turn users like Dragapult and Tapu Koko from freely using them for momentum, especially when paired with Knock Off support. Skarmory can also check most of the strong physical attackers that can beat them, like Rillaboom and Landorus-T. Skarmory is especially valuable to sand teams, as it can check Pokemon that they are usually weak to like Rillaboom and Excadrill, forming a solid defensive core with either specially defensive Tyranitar or Hippowdon, the two viable sand setters.</p>"

Thanks to Teleport's great utility, Blissey can safely bring in a teammate and get momentum against your opponents. In addition, Teleport in tandem with its ability to check many special attackers let Blissey perform as an effective pivot. Natural Cure and Heavy-Duty Boots synergize well with Teleport and make Blissey hard to wear down, as it doesn't have to fear status. However, Blissey is a very passive Pokemon and is vulnerable to Taunt. Blissey is also threatened by the prevalence of strong Knock Off users such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Clefable due to its poor physical bulk and reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent it from being worn down by entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is an option to outlast Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, but it should only be used when its team is lacking a Stealth Rock setter. Heal Bell and Aromatherapy are useful on more defensive teams that benefit from a cleric and don't need status support, but it comes at the cost of not being able to inflict status on foes. Wish is an option on defensive teams to support teammates that lack reliable recovery such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Melmetal, but it prevents Blissey from using Teleport, as these two moves are incompatible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Landorus-T, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Garchomp overpower Blissey with their strong STAB moves; notably, Rillaboom and Kartana can proceed to OHKO it. Landorus-T, Kartana, and Rillaboom also boast access to Knock Off, which they can easily use against Blissey and potential switch-ins due to Blissey's vulnerability to physical wallbreakers. However, all of them have to fear status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Hawlucha, Urshifu-R, and Galarian Zapdos are able to threaten a KO on Blissey with their strong STAB options. However, all of them have to be wary of directly switching into Blissey, as it can dish out status effects. Pokemon that Blissey usually walls, such as Nidoking and Hydreigon, can lure it in and pressure it with Focus Punch and Superpower, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Heatran can disrupt Blissey's ability to heal itself with Soft-Boiled. Calm Mind Tapu Fini with Taunt and Draining Kiss also turns Blissey into setup fodder, as Taunt can shut down Blissey's utility entirely.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Blissey dislikes Knock Off, as Heavy-Duty Boots are key to keeping it healthy, and losing it makes Blissey less effective at checking threats throughout the game. Ferrothorn especially is troublesome for Blissey, as it can remove Blissey's item and proceed to set up entry hazards and Leech Seed. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, Choice Specs Latios, and the rare Choice Scarf Clefable can cripple Blissey with Trick.</p>",

Thunder Wave is preferred, as it punishes Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Kartana. However, Toxic can be used to cripple setup sweepers such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Volcarona; it also deters physical attackers such as Hawlucha and Urshifu-R from directly switching into Blissey. Teleport lets Blissey pivot against special attackers to facilitate momentum for offensive teammates.</p> <p>Blissey fits well on teams such as bulky offense and balance, as it checks dangerous special attackers such as Nidoking and Volcanion and generates momentum against them. Offensive wallbreakers like Nidoking and Tapu Lele appreciate being safely brought in via Blissey's Teleport, as they normally have trouble switching in due to their poor defensive typing and stats. Due to its access to Teleport, Blissey is able to form a pivoting core with partners such as Landorus-T and Corviknight. Corviknight in particular has great synergy with Blissey, as it is able to check physical wallbreakers such as Rillaboom and Landorus-T, while Blissey is able to check special attackers like Tapu Koko and Volcarona for it. Blissey is easily pressured by physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Landorus-T; therefore, physically defensive walls such as the aforementioned Corviknight, Zapdos, and Toxapex are good partners. In return, Blissey checks special wallbreakers such as Nidoking for them. Blissey is also great on more passive teams because of its ability to check the majority of special attackers. Unlike other common specially defensive walls seen on bulky offense teams like Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, Blissey is an amazing long-term check to key offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Dragapult.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar has agelessly established itself as a metagame staple in generation 8 OverUsed. Its defensive profile is more valuable than ever with its ability to check some of the metagame's top threats, such as Heatran and Dragapult, while its offensive capabilities when equipped with a Choice Band are desirable for punching through the tier's bulky structures. Additionally, Sand Stream is a fantastic ability that not only enables sand sweepers like Sand Rush Excadrill but also disrupts other weather teams, such as hail from Alolan Ninetales and rain from Pelipper. However, Tyranitar's lack of reliable recovery and numerous type weaknesses make it vulnerable to being worn down over the course of a match, with its low Speed compounding issues, as it moves last more often than not. However, with the right team that can cover for these weaknesses, the Armor Pokemon is still a fearsome adversary to deal with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band sets can run Assurance over a coverage move so Tyranitar can break through checks like Corviknight and Toxapex if its team has set up entry hazards. Aerial Ace is another alternative to break through Buzzwole, as it can otherwise stomach Tyranitar's moves quite well. However, this sacrifices a coverage slot for other checks, as Aerial Ace has very little use outside of this. Specially defensive variants can opt to run Fire Blast over a status move to nail checks like Skarmory and Ferrothorn, but this is highly discouraged because the utility of Toxic and Thunder Wave is generally more useful. Tyranitar can also run Heavy-Duty Boots over Leftovers to ignore entry hazards, but it usually prefers the passive recovery of Leftovers boosting its longevity. Tyranitar can opt for a Dragon Dance set on offensive teams, but its awkward Speed tier makes setting up difficult, as it can still be revenge killed after a boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Buzzwole resist Tyranitar's STAB moves and can stomach most of its coverage moves reasonably well before threatening it out with STAB Close Combat. Buzzwole deserves a special mention, as it has gargantuan physical bulk and reliable recovery to check Tyranitar in the long- run. However, it has to watch out for Choice Band sets carrying Aerial Ace and specially defensive sets with Toxic. Meanwhile, Urshifu-R is greatly annoyed by Thunder Wave lowering its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Melmetal, Ferrothorn, physically defensive Heatran, Corviknight, and Skarmory have the physical bulk to take Tyranitar's STAB moves and threaten it back with Double Iron Bash, Body Press, or Heavy Slam. Physically defensive Heatran can also annoy Tyranitar with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp while Corviknight and Skarmory can stonewall specially defensive Tyranitar. However, all of them are vulnerable to Tyranitar's coverage moves, so they dislike switching into Tyranitar recklessly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon can switch into Tyranitar in a pinch due to their good bulk backed by Intimidate or a resistance to Rock-type moves and can retaliate with STAB Earthquake. However, Landorus-T and Garchomp get obliterated by Ice Punch, and Hippowdon's low Speed requires it to be healthy to switch into Tyranitar. All of them also dislike Toxic putting them on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable and Tapu Fini aren't particularly bothered by specially defensive variants due to their bulk, immunity to Toxic, and resistance to Crunch, and they can slowly wear down Tyranitar with their STAB moves. They can also switch into Choice Band variants locked into a coverage move or Crunch. However, they dislike taking Stone Edge and Heavy Slam, so they cannot reliably switch into Choice Band Tyranitar. Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko can offensively pressure Tyranitar with their STAB moves, but Tyranitar's incredible bulk under sand makes this potentially risky, as it can survive a hit before retaliating with a strong attack.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Kartana and Rillaboom can OHKO Tyranitar with Leaf Blade and Grassy Glide, respectively, and can even take a neutral hit from Choice Band variants if needed. However, they lack the bulk and recovery to reliably switch into Choice Band Tyranitar, and specially defensive variants can annoy them with Thunder Wave. Tangrowth's titanic physical bulk and access to Regenerator allow it to reliably switch into Tyranitar before retaliating with Power Whip or Focus Blast, but chip damage from entry hazards and sandstorm can put it in range of a 2HKO against Choice Band Tyranitar, and it dislikes Toxic from specially defensive variants.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Barraskewda and Volcanion can threaten Tyranitar with their STAB moves, with Barraskewda using Tyranitar as Flip Turn fodder while Volcanion can use Tyranitar as a free opportunity to unleash Steam Eruption, which can generate progress by burning any potential switch-ins. However, Barraskewda's poor bulk and Volcanion's weakness to Rock-type moves make them unviable switch-ins. Toxapex can take Tyranitar's STAB moves reasonably well and is immune to Toxic, but it can be worn down through repeated attacks and is extremely vulnerable to Earthquake from Choice Band variants.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar is arguably the best wallbreaker in the metagame. While its STAB moves are obvious, there are a plethora of options for its final two moveslots. Superpower hits Steel-types like Melmetal and Ferrothorn that can otherwise take its STAB moves well, but Fire Punch is a viable alternative if Tyranitar desires to hit Ferrothorn even harder while also covering Steel-types that are neutral to Superpower, such as Corviknight and Scizor. Heavy Slam obliterates Fairy-types like Clefable, but Ice Punch can also be run if targeting Garchomp and Landorus-T is more important. Earthquake is another option to threaten Heatran and Melmetal more effectively when running Fire Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar fits perfectly on offensive teams looking for a wallbreaker that can tear holes in sturdy defensive cores for late-game sweepers to take advantage of. Excadrill is an exemplary teammate for multiple reasons: it can take advantage of Tyranitar's sand with Sand Rush to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, sets up with Swords Dance and Rapid Spin to sweep late-game even if sand is not active, and is an offensive check to Fairy-types like Clefable that can threaten Tyranitar. Choice Specs Dragapult enjoys Tyranitar's wallbreaking so it can cleave through weakened defensive cores with its incredible Speed tier and provides U-turn support to get Tyranitar on the field safely. This is particularly potent, as Dragapult demands that Pokemon like Blissey, Gastrodon, and specially defensive Heatran switch into it, which are extremely vulnerable to Tyranitar. Ferrothorn is a fantastic teammate, as it serves as a sturdy Fairy check against threats like Tapu Lele and Tapu Fini, can set up entry hazards to make up for Choice Band Tyranitar's inability to do so, and is not affected by sand due to its typing. Ferrothorn can also remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Toxapex, Clefable, and Buzzwole that often switch into Tyranitar, preventing Tyranitar from being worn down. Zapdos and Tornadus-T serve as solid checks to Ground-, Grass- and Fighting-types like Garchomp, Kartana, and Buzzwole while providing Tyranitar with pivoting support via Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Slowbro are appreciated, as they can stave off the likes of Barraskewda and Urshifu-R, and both can also bring Tyranitar onto the field safely with Volt Switch and Teleport, respectively. Slowbro has the bonus of providing Future Sight support for Tyranitar to break through its checks, such as Buzzwole and Skarmory.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Specially defensive Tyranitar is one of the better tanks in the metagame with its sand-boosted special bulk, status options, and deep offensive movepool. Stealth Rock allows Tyranitar to take advantage of the switches it forces to set up entry hazards, which has fantastic synergy with Tyranitar's ability to threaten some of the best Defoggers in the tier, such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Rock Blast is preferred over Stone Edge due to its higher accuracy and multi-hit nature, allowing it to break past Substitute from Pokemon like Volcarona and Arctozolt. Earthquake gives Tyranitar fantastic coverage, allowing it to hit Steel-types like Melmetal and Heatran that can shrug off Rock Blast. Crunch can be run over Earthquake if Tyranitar prefers to threaten Ghost- and Psychic-types like Dragapult, Mew, and Slowbro. Thunder Wave and Toxic are both viable options for the final moveslot. Outside of slowing down fast threats like Dragapult and Kartana, Thunder Wave can greatly annoy switch-ins like Corviknight and Ferrothorn, as they do not appreciate potentially being immobilized by paralysis. Toxic can put switch-ins like Buzzwole and Rotom-W on a timer, allowing Tyranitar to break past them in the long run. The given EV spread allows Tyranitar to live Triple Axel from Jolly Weavile after a Swords Dance boost and OHKO specially defensive Heatran with Earthquake or Dragapult with Crunch while maximizing special bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Tyranitar is a great fit on teams looking for a special tank that can force progress by setting up entry hazards and spreading status. Slowbro is a wonderful defensive partner; it is a sturdy check to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type Pokemon that threaten Tyranitar, such as Urshifu-R, Buzzwole, and Garchomp. In return, Tyranitar stonewalls Ghost-types like Dragapult and Blacephalon that Slowbro is terrified of and is one of the tier's better checks to Volcarona, which can set up on Slowbro. Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos can help out against Fighting- and Ground-types like Galarian Zapdos and Landorus-T while shielding Tyranitar from Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana. Tornadus-T also appreciates Tyranitar threatening one of its best checks in Zapdos. Ferrothorn forms a potent hazard stacking core with Tyranitar, as Spikes greatly pressures Tyranitar's grounded switch-ins like Buzzwole and Tapu Fini. Moreover, Ferrothorn can take on Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele, while Tyranitar can chase out Fire-types that obliterate Ferrothorn, such as Heatran and Volcarona. Offensive partners that can take advantage of Tyranitar's Stealth Rock also make for great teammates. Dragapult likes Stealth Rock wearing down switch-ins like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Tapu Fini and is immune to Body Press from Tyranitar's greatest checks in Skarmory and Corviknight, allowing it to freely switch into them before forcing them out. Kartana is a notable offensive partner, as it shares checks with Tyranitar; outside of appreciating Stealth Rock chipping away at Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight, it loves Tyranitar potentially rendering Skarmory and Corviknight immobile with Thunder Wave or putting Buzzwole on a timer with Toxic. Tyranitar can also pressure Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T for Kartana while Kartana can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos and Tornadus-T in return, making them vulnerable to Tyranitar's Stealth Rock. Finally, Excadrill has fantastic synergy with Tyranitar; Sand Rush allows it to be one of the best late-game sweepers in the tier when sand is active, it can pressure Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko, and it appreciates Tyranitar paralyzing shared checks like Corviknight and Skarmory so it can threaten to break through them with Iron Head or Rock Slide.</p>"

Flip Turn allows it to function as a slow pivot that can directly pressure Defoggers while clawing back momentum. Swampert's good defensive typing lets it switch into common special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, Heatran, and Volcarona and use the opportunity to set Stealth Rock or generate momentum on forced switches. Swampert can offer additional utility by punishing common entry hazard removers like Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Zapdos with Toxic. However, Swampert's lack of reliable recovery makes it susceptible to being worn down from repeatedly switching into attacks and entry hazards. Due to its narrow niche, Swampert faces competition from other bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Slowking, Toxapex, and Gastrodon, which boast more longevity with reliable recovery moves and Regenerator in the former three's case. While Swampert boasts access to Flip Turn compared to other traditional bulky offensive Ground-types like Garchomp, it lacks the utility of Landorus-T, which is able to remove a Defogger's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect may be used over Toxic to increase Swampert's longevity by providing extra Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery and to scout common Choice item Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele. Yawn can be used as a disrupting move to deny setup sweepers or prevent opposing Defoggers from removing entry hazards. It can also be used in conjunction with Flip Turn to gain momentum if the opponent decides to switch out to prevent sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Common offensive Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Kartana can switch into and either outright KO Swampert or use it as setup fodder. Defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Ferrothorn can also punish Swampert's Flip Turn with Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs damage. However, Swampert can punish Rillaboom and Tangrowth with Toxic and deny Kartana setup opportunities with Yawn or Flip Turn.</p> <p><strong>Specific Wallbreakers</strong>: Swampert is unable to reliably switch into unresisted attacks from wallbreakers and often relies on other team members to switch into Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Entry Hazards</strong>: Swampert's lack of reliable recovery makes it very susceptible to entry hazards and contact punishment from Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs.

Toxic is used to punish Defoggers and bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Slowking, as well as common Grass-type switch-ins such as Rillaboom and Tangrowth. High Horsepower may be used over Earthquake to avoid Grassy Terrain's damage reduction, but it may result in Swampert taking more chip damage from Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, and Flame Body.

Swampert can use its slow Flip Turn against bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth and Toxapex to safely bring in powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Blacephalon, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Choice Band Rillaboom. Corviknight is an excellent partner since it appreciates Swampert's ability to switch into Fire- and Electric-type moves such as Magma Storm, Flamethrower, Volt Switch, and Thunderbolt, while Corviknight can be used to switch into many Grass-types that threaten Swampert and forms a pivoting core with it that is great at maintaining momentum. Other Flying-types like Zapdos can also be used to offensively threaten Grass- and Water-types, which may be a nuisance for Swampert. Grass-type Knock Off users such as Rillaboom and Kartana appreciate the Stealth Rock and Toxic chip damage Swampert provides against Flying-type Defoggers that usually switch into them. Swampert also benefits from Rillaboom's Grassy Surge providing it with an extra round of recovery per turn, though it is important to run High Horsepower over Earthquake to prevent damage reduction.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With a great typing that helps cancel out its own weaknesses, an amazing array of stats, solid coverage options, and a useful ability in Rough Skin, Garchomp is a highly versatile Pokemon with excellent offensive and defensive capabilities. It can either be a terrifying wallbreaker with a nearly unresisted STAB combination, useful coverage, and an above average Speed tier, or it can excel as a tank with the ability to set up Stealth Rock easily thanks to the pressure it places with Toxic on Defoggers like Tornadus-T and access to a powerful uninvested Earthquake. However, Garchomp's offensive sets can struggle due to the unreliable nature of Scale Shot; it has poor accuracy, hits an inconsistent number of times, and can be blocked by Fairy-type Pokemon. Its Stealth Rock-setting capabilities are also hampered by it being easy for Corviknight to use Defog on, and its defensive role is also under heavy competition from Landorus-T due to Landorus-T's access to utility moves like Defog, Knock Off, and U-turn. Garchomp also struggles in longer games due to its lack of reliable recovery, leaving it vulnerable to chip damage from Pokemon it wishes to check like Heatran and Zapdos thanks to Magma Storm and Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used in tandem with Leftovers on Swords Dance Garchomp to give it turns to set up on a free switch, as well as the ability to save itself from revenge killing attempts. Specially defensive Garchomp can utilize Roar to phaze threatening Pokemon like Landorus-T and Zapdos, forcing them to take more chip damage from Stealth Rock, though this means it has to lose either Toxic, Protect, or important coverage. Rest gives Garchomp the ability to fully recover its health and heal itself from any status, shutting down plans to wear Garchomp down with Toxic, but it puts Garchomp to sleep, making it an incredibly risky move that leaves Garchomp vulnerable to opposing Pokemon. Stealth Rock is an option on Swords Dance sets due to how well they are able to pressure common Defog users like Landorus-T, but this means that Garchomp has to drop its coverage option, which leaves it open to more counterplay. Faster sets with Rocky Helmet are also valuable, sacrificing the longevity of Leftovers in favor of punishing physical attackers like Melmetal and Urshifu-R and U-turn from Tornadus-T and Landorus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable can be difficult to handle, as they can tank most hits from Garchomp and threaten it back with a powerful Moonblast, though they can be overwhelmed by Swords Dance sets and, more importantly, ones that run Life Orb. While their Dragon immunity can prevent Garchomp from getting off a Scale Shot, this is an unreliable method of counterplay due to Garchomp's ability to predict this and go for Earthquake instead. Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Alolan Ninetales are also solid checks to Garchomp when paired with Pokemon immune to Earthquake, forcing it to choose correctly and then outspeeding and forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Walls like Slowbro and Buzzwole can consistently come in on Garchomp if it lacks Toxic and threaten it with Scald or Ice Punch, scaring it out. Garchomp can, however, overwhelm these Pokemon with enough Swords Dance boosts.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: With an immunity to Earthquake, a resistance to Scale Shot, and the ability to use IronPress to wall it, Corviknight and Skarmory are some of the sturdiest checks to Garchomp in the tier. Even outside of IronPress, Corviknight can use U-turn to pivot out into a revenge killer safely as well as freely using Defog on bulky Garchomp, with Pressure stalling its Stealth Rock PP, and Skarmory can use Toxic to help slowly whittle Garchomp down. These two Pokemon are extremely difficult for any Garchomp set that does not have Fire Blast to deal with; however, Fire Blast sets scare Skarmory away and force Corviknight to use its Roost PP.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon such as Weavile, Rillaboom, and Choice Scarf Kartana all have the ability to get rid of Swords Dance Garchomp sets, especially after a Scale Shot and some minor chip damage. Weavile and Rillaboom in particular are scary due to their ability to scare out tank Garchomp thanks to the former's 4x super effective STAB moves, notably having Ice Shard as a priority move, and the latter's Grassy Surge weakening Earthquake and making Grassy Glide a powerful priority attack. Dragapult is able to naturally outspeed unboosted Garchomp and consistently threatens to OHKO any variant of it with Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts.</p>",

Scale Shot's ability to boost Garchomp's Speed allows it to outspeed the majority of its revenge killers and sweep opposing teams. Aqua Tail helps Garchomp take down the likes of Landorus-T and Air Balloon Heatran. Fire Fang is used to hit Corviknight and Skarmory, as they ignore Garchomp's moves otherwise. Leftovers helps boost Garchomp's longevity, letting it take Heatran's Magma Storm more easily and avoid a 2HKO from specially defensive Landorus-T. Life Orb Garchomp trades its longevity for explosive damage, giving it a guaranteed OHKO on Calm Mind Clefable, Urshifu-R, and Ferrothorn as well as Tapu Fini after Stealth Rock damage and a Swords Dance boost. Lum Berry and Roseli Berry are also solid options, as the former helps block status from Landorus-T and Hippowdon's Toxic and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp, while the latter helps prevent Garchomp from being revenge killed by Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Garchomp is most commonly seen on offensive teams that love its ability to wallbreak or hyper offense teams that can support its full sweep. Pokemon that love Garchomp's ability to smash through teams and pressure Flying-type Pokemon, like Kartana and Urshifu-R, fit excellently with it, pressuring Flying-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zapdos to help overwhelm them. Urshifu-R also baits Toxapex in for Garchomp to take advantage of. Steel-type Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran switch in on and take out Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko, allowing Garchomp to set up more easily without their presence. All three function as excellent Rillaboom and Weavile answers, while Heatran and Melmetal can also help overwhelm sturdy Garchomp checks like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Tapu Fini. Magnezone is an excellent teammate, as its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and Corviknight is amazing for Garchomp. Slowbro has excellent synergy with Garchomp, as Garchomp is able to break through annoying Pokemon like Zapdos and Zeraora for it, while Slowbro can effectively handle Urshifu-R and Barraskewda and bring Garchomp in safely for setup opportunities with Teleport. Partners on hyper offense teams like Mew and Life Orb Weavile can break through Garchomp's defensive answers like Landorus-T, Zapdos, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Slowbro, making it easier for it to sweep. Weavile in particular is excellent, as it can easily break through these Pokemon with a Swords Dance boost while checking Rillaboom with Ice Shard. Dual screens setters like Alolan Ninetales help make setting up with Garchomp easier and enable a potential sweep.</p>"

Protect is useful for not only helping Garchomp regenerate its health with Leftovers but also scouting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult, stalling out weather and Terrain turns, and gaining more free chip damage from burn and Toxic. Fire Blast gives Garchomp the ability to pressure some of its common annoyances, mainly Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory.

Leftovers gives Garchomp important longevity, allowing it to recover its health throughout the game and helping reduce the amount of chip damage it takes from entry hazards and Heatran's Magma Storm, which it often switches into as one of Heatran's best checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garchomp fits best on bulky offense teams that love its entry hazard setting capabilities and defensive profile. Knock Off users such as Kartana, Zeraora, and Weavile complement Garchomp well, with Kartana baiting in Flying-types and removing their Heavy-Duty Boots to make them vulnerable to Stealth Rock damage and the last two taking down some of Garchomp's checks, with Zeraora handling Tapu Fini and Tornadus-T and Weavile shutting down Landorus-T. Defensive partners such as Corviknight and Slowbro match well with Garchomp to create a strong defensive core; they appreciate Garchomp's ability to take on threats like Heatran and Zapdos for them, while they handle the likes of Melmetal and Urshifu-R. Corviknight also comes equipped with the ability to take on Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that Garchomp hates like Tapu Lele and Weavile, making for an excellent teammate. Rillaboom has fantastic synergy with Garchomp, as it can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T with Knock Off, forcing them to take Stealth Rock damage. Though Rillaboom does weaken Garchomp's Earthquake via Grassy Terrain, the additional recovery helps Garchomp be much more resilient by using Protect to recover significant amounts of HP when Grassy Terrain is active. This also preserves Garchomp's recovery if its Leftovers have been removed by Pokemon like Zeraora and Tornadus-T via Knock Off, making Rillaboom a unique and powerful partner.</p>"

However, Hippowdon's susceptibility to being pivoted against by these Pokemon makes it easy to wear down and forces it to switch out. It also faces stiff competition as a defensive Ground-type from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swampert, and Gastrodon; however, Hippowdon manages to offset this due to reliable recovery in Slack Off and access to Stealth Rock. Additionally, as Hippowdon is a passive Stealth Rock setter, it is difficult to keep its entry hazards on the field against common entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, since it can only use Whirlwind or Toxic to dissuade them. Hippowdon is also vulnerable to entry hazards and status, which make it much harder to remain healthy while checking offensive threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sand Force can be run instead of Sand Stream to prevent sand damage from being detrimental to Hippowdon's teammates and ensure they gain recovery from Leftovers. A physically defensive set can be used instead of the specially defensive variant to check prominent physical threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Melmetal. This physical set can often run Rocky Helmet to chip physical attackers and pivots such as Melmetal and Tapu Koko, although Hippowdon should be wary of Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: Hippowdon hates facing Corviknight and Skarmory due to its inability to do anything against them, especially if Hippowdon is not carrying Whirlwind. Skarmory can then use Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Corviknight can remove entry hazards with Defog. At best, Hippowdon can use Whirlwind against them or Earthquake as they heal with Roost, but it fails to sufficiently weaken them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hippowdon is easily worn down by status and entry hazards, which prevent it from checking Pokemon as effectively as it would like.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Weavile threatens Hippowdon with its powerful Ice-type STAB moves, although it cannot come in on a potential Earthquake or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Kartana wall Hippowdon and force it out, as they easily tank Earthquake and shrug off its coverage moves. Ferrothorn can take advantage of Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Rillaboom and Kartana can pressure Hippowdon with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Slowking threaten Hippowdon with Scald and apply pressure with Future Sight, while Tapu Fini does not fear Earthquake, prevents status with Misty Terrain, and can remove Stealth Rock if it chooses to run Defog.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hippowdon functions as a sturdy check to special attackers such as Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Volcarona and provides helpful utility with Toxic and Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Toxic allows Hippowdon to punish non-Poison-immune Flying-types that attempt to remove its entry hazards, such as Zapdos and Mandibuzz, and other vulnerable walls such as Tangrowth, Slowking, and Swampert. Whirlwind is also a viable option, allowing Hippowdon to phaze foes it cannot do much against, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Whirlwind can also be used to prevent Hippowdon from being used as setup fodder by setup sweepers like Clefable and Volcarona. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with passive recovery and helps alleviate pressure from offensive threats by letting it waste less turns healing with Slack Off. 8 Attack EVs ensure Hippowdon OHKOes Excadrill with Earthquake. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents residual damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, although the passive recovery from Leftovers is in most cases too good to pass up.</p> <p>Hippowdon's Electric immunity and access to reliable recovery give it defensive synergy with partners on more defensive teams and pivots such as Toxapex and Clefable; it helps the team from being overwhelmed by Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko. Pressure users such as Corviknight and Moltres are great partners alongside Hippowdon, as they can wear down the PP of Defog and make it much easier for Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock to stay up long-term - they can also provide entry hazard removal so that Hippowdon doesn’t get worn down by entry hazards. Sand Rush Excadrill can utilize Hippowdon's sand to clean late-game after a Swords Dance while also providing entry hazard removal. Knock Off and status absorbers like Clefable and Reuniclus are useful if Hippowdon is being utilized on defensive teams, as they provide the team with much more longevity in the long term. Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini are greatly appreciated; Toxapex can handle Weavile and Toxic Melmetal, while Tapu Fini can prevent status from crippling Hippowdon, although this also prevents Hippowdon from using Toxic against grounded Pokemon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With its low-risk, high-reward Knock Off backed up by Triple Axel and an excellent Speed tier— which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame barring Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora and fire off strong attacks without taking a hit itself—Weavile establishes itself as a top threat every team needs to be prepared for. Knock Off and Triple Axel have amazing synergy, as Triple Axel's main flaw is that Rocky Helmet users that can take a Triple Axel can punish Weavile with heavy damage, but Knock Off can remove Rocky Helmet from these Pokemon, allowing Weavile to use Triple Axel more freely. Its Dark / Ice STAB combination also allows it to threaten many tier staples such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Slowbro with an OHKO, forcing out these Pokemon to gain opportunities to spam Knock Off. Weavile also serves as a valuable check to Swords Dance Garchomp and Choice Specs Dragapult, with its Ice Shard OHKOing Garchomp after its Defense is dropped by Scale Shot, as well as serving as one of the tier's only Ghost-resistant Pokemon. However, Weavile is held back by various contact-punishing effects, including the previously mentioned Rocky Helmet as well as Flame Body, Static, and Iron Barbs. Flame Body Heatran and Volcarona can take Triple Axel with ease while being favored to inflict a burn on Weavile, ruining its offensive capabilities. Zapdos cannot safely switch into Weavile, but it has favorable odds to inflict paralysis when Triple Axel is used, and a paralyzed Weavile is nearly useless in many matchups due to its poor bulk and defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb is an option over Heavy-Duty Boots on Swords Dance sets with an Adamant nature on hyper offense to make Weavile nearly unwallable after using Swords Dance, as it lets Weavile OHKO Pokemon that would otherwise counter it, like Corviknight, Skarmory, and defensive Buzzwole, at +2 after Stealth Rock. However, Life Orb Weavile becomes very vulnerable to passive damage from Stealth Rock, its own Life Orb, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs. Despite the sheer power provided by Life Orb, Weavile is still checked by Urshifu-R, Melmetal, and Tapu Fini at +2, while Ferrothorn, especially if holding Rocky Helmet, can often force a trade with +2 Weavile. Additionally, Choice Scarf users and Tapu Koko forcing Weavile out becomes much more punishing due to the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots, as Weavile will usually take entry hazard damage whenever it attempts to switch in again. Low Kick can be used both with and without a Life Orb. Without a Life Orb, Low Kick can be used to deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn and bulky Melmetal while OHKOing Heatran at +2, while with a Life Orb, Low Kick can OHKO Ferrothorn and Melmetal after a Swords Dance and opposing Weavile before a Swords Dance. Giving up Ice Shard for Low Kick results in Weavile being unable to check boosted Dragonite and Garchomp, while dropping Triple Axel results in Weavile being checked by Pokemon like Buzzwole, Corviknight, Clefable, Skarmory, and Tapu Fini, even at +2. Icicle Crash can be used as an alternative option on Choice Band sets, with higher accuracy, a lack of contact, and a chance to flinch, which minimizes randomness and thus is particularly nice against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Zapdos. However, Icicle Crash sacrifices a lot of power and most notably fails to OHKO Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Dragonite, and defensive Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon, including Dragapult, Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Tapu Lele, can force Weavile to switch out. While all Weavile sets dislike revenge killers, Life Orb and Choice Band sets get put on an especially fast timer before they succumb to entry hazard damage if forced out repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Melmetal, Ferrothorn, bulky Scizor, and physically defensive Heatran can switch into Weavile while also threatening to make progress through wallbreaking and setting entry hazards. However, Low Kick variants can bypass Steel-types weak to Fighting with correct prediction, although Weavile still risks a burn from Heatran's Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Urshifu-R, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini can counter Weavile with their good physical bulk and resistance to Triple Axel. Urshifu-R and Tapu Fini additionally resist Knock Off, while Toxapex doesn't mind losing its item and can take damage from Knock Off well. Urshifu-R threatens to break through Weavile's teammates with its powerful attacks and threatens Weavile with Close Combat. Toxapex can disrupt Weavile and its teammates with moves like Toxic, Scald, and Knock Off to make free progress while having both Recover and Regenerator to stay healthy long-term. Tapu Fini can set up Calm Mind or punish switch-ins with Whirlpool or Trick while forcing Weavile out with the threat of Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Contact Punishers</strong>: Pokemon that can trigger negative effects like status and chip damage through Rocky Helmet or an ability can punish almost all of Weavile's best options. Ferrothorn and physically defensive Heatran are the worst to face, as they have the bulk and typing to take multiple hits from Weavile; however, even Pokemon weak to Ice, like Garchomp and Zapdos, can be sacrificed to inflict negative effects in a pinch. Although Volcarona is crippled by Knock Off, bulky variants can threaten a burn on Weavile. Rocky Helmet users like Toxapex, Buzzwole, Clefable, Corviknight, and Skarmory can take on Heavy-Duty Boots Weavile while dealing significant damage back to it with Rocky Helmet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Weavile threatens heavy damage with Swords Dance-boosted attacks and disrupts opposing teams with Knock Off. Swords Dance enables Weavile to OHKO Pokemon like Choice Band Tyranitar and Kartana with Triple Axel after a boost and heavily weaken Pokemon like Buzzwole, Corviknight, and Skarmory for other physical attackers like Urshifu-R, Kartana, and Garchomp to finish off. Ice Shard is mainly useful for Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Dragonite, as it can OHKO them after they use Scale Shot or take chip damage, respectively; however, other Pokemon, including weakened Rillaboom and Dragapult, can also be picked off. The immunity to entry hazards granted by Heavy-Duty Boots allows Weavile to last longer while being less reliant on Taunt, Defog, and Rapid Spin support, which is important to gain more opportunities to use Knock Off and support its team's effort of breaking through the opposing team. A Jolly nature is preferred on Weavile to outspeed Tornadus-T while tying with Modest Dragapult and other Jolly Weavile. Adamant can be used instead, making Weavile slower than the aforementioned Pokemon but giving it the capability to OHKO Pokemon like bulky Volcarona, Clefable, and opposing Weavile at +2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weavile's excellence at wallbreaking and removing items allows it to form powerful synergies with many Pokemon. Future Sight users like Slowbro, Tapu Lele, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can help Weavile break through checks like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and Urshifu-R. Steel-types like Melmetal, Heatran, and Ferrothorn trying to absorb both Future Sight and Knock Off lose their items like Assault Vest and Leftovers in the process, which greatly assists Tapu Lele in wallbreaking or cleaning up weakened teams. Tapu Lele and Weavile also provide answers to both of Dragapult's STAB types. Galarian Slowking gains easy entry on one of Weavile's best checks in Toxapex while checking some of Weavile's revenge killers, like Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, as well as Tapu Fini, which is a counter to Weavile. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can also scout what move Choice Specs Dragapult locks into, allowing Weavile to safely come in on Shadow Ball. Slowbro can bring in Weavile safely with Teleport while checking Urshifu-R, defensive Buzzwole, and Melmetal. Entry hazard-setting teammates like Landorus-T, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Garchomp are amazing partners, as Weavile's Knock Off enables their hazards to reach their full potential by removing Heavy-Duty Boots. These Pokemon have additional synergies with Weavile as well. Specially defensive Landorus-T checks Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Dragapult that can threaten Weavile, and it can also use a slow U-turn against Pokemon like opposing Landorus-T and Tornadus-T to bring in Weavile safely. Heatran benefits from Weavile removing Shed Shell from Toxapex, allowing Heatran to trap it, which in turn removes one of Weavile's counters. Ferrothorn's Spikes in conjunction with Weavile's Knock Off has potential to be far more potent than Stealth Rock, and Ferrothorn also checks important Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Fini that can revenge kill or wall Weavile. Mew is a great teammate on hyper offense for Life Orb Weavile especially, as it can both deny opposing entry hazards with Taunt and set Spikes to wear down Steel-type checks like Melmetal and Ferrothorn. Despite helping with the matchup, Weavile cannot handle Dragapult alone, so specially defensive Pokemon like Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Clefable can assist against it. Weavile cannot safely switch in against most Pokemon, which makes pivots like Tapu Koko and Landorus-T excellent partners. Tapu Koko can bring Weavile in with U-turn against Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; however, both it and Weavile struggle with Ferrothorn. Therefore, Fire-types like Heatran and Victini can be used alongside them to threaten Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Melmetal appreciate Weavile removing items from shared counters like Toxapex and Buzzwole, especially if they are running Rocky Helmet, as these wallbreakers' main attacks are both multi-hit and contact. Urshifu-R can also break through Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran and pressure Blaziken, boosted Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Blacephalon with Aqua Jet. Protective Pads Urshifu-R, in particular, can use Taunt against Buzzwole to prevent it from recovering, which helps Weavile break through it. In return, Weavile can threaten Zapdos, Dragonite, and Dragapult for Urshifu-R. Melmetal and Heatran can check Fairy-types like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Clefable for Weavile, while Weavile can take on Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T for them.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Weavile is a powerful wallbreaker that can punch holes in teams with its strong STAB moves and high Speed. Ice Shard is good at picking off faster foes such as Dragapult, as well as boosted Garchomp and Dragonite, and it can also outprioritize Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Triple Axel is insanely strong when backed by Choice Band, 2HKOing Clefable, as well as 2HKOing defensive Buzzwole after Stealth Rock. Knock Off lets Weavile remove items from its checks early-game such as Rocky Helmet from Buzzwole, Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight or Leftovers from Melmetal and Tapu Fini. Low Kick allows Weavile to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran for super effective damage. Another option is Beat Up, which, when paired with strong physical attackers is an immensely strong, no-contact STAB move that allows it to muscle through many targets early-game such as Toxapex and Corviknight. A Jolly nature is used to allow Weavile to be as fast as possible, letting it outspeed Tornadus-T and Speed tie Modest Dragapult. However, an Adamant nature can be used to maximize its damage output, most notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on Ferrothorn and defensive Buzzwole with Low Kick and Triple Axel, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Choice Band Weavile is vulnerable to entry hazards, Defog users such as Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T make excellent teammates. All of these can also U-turn to bring Weavile in safely, with Landorus-T additionally being able to check Heatran for Weavile. Future Sight support from Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, Slowbro, and Slowking are greatly appreciated, since they can help Weavile break through common checks such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Buzzwole. Slowbro and Slowking in particular can bring Weavile safely onto the field with Teleport and can also check Urshifu-R and Heatran, respectively. Physical attackers such as Garchomp, Kartana, Melmetal, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R are all excellent partners, as they all boost the power of Beat Up and overwhelm checks such as Buzzwole and Corviknight, Rillaboom in particular pairs well with Weavile, luring in Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T while also softening defensive cores with Knock Off, it also threatens Urshifu-R and Tapu Fini for Weavile. Heatran is a superb partner, as it can scare out some of Weavile's checks like Melmetal, Volcarona, Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Other Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Melmetal can also help check Clefable and Tapu Lele for Weavile. Ferrothorn can also set up Spikes for Weavile to take advantage of while Melmetal can lure in Pokemon like Slowbro and Zapdos for Weavile to exploit. Garchomp is a great partner, as it can force out common checks to Weavile such as Toxapex and Heatran, while Weavile can help Garchomp by threatening Slowbro and Landorus-T. Urshifu-R also pairs well with Weavile, appreciating the fact that Weavile can force out Slowbro, Dragonite, and Zapdos, while Urshifu-R can offensively check Blaziken, Melmetal, and Heatran.</p>"

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's main draw is trapping and removing Steel-types such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull. This support greatly enables many of the strongest sweepers and wallbreakers in the tier, such as Garchomp and Rillaboom. Its coverage is limited but effective, with different options to trap additional foes. However, Magnezone is held back offensively due to its low base Speed, leaving it revenge killed by the many faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Its lack of longevity is also fairly limiting, denying it a defensive niche despite its great defensive typing. Further, Magnezone can't trap all relevant Steel-types with one set, forcing it to pick certain targets to trap.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If paired with Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Magnezone can opt to run Rising Voltage for an Electric-type STAB move that is extremely hard to switch into. Its reliance on Electric Terrain makes it somewhat inconsistent, but the reward is worthwhile. Rising Voltage's power also lets Magnezone run Choice Scarf over Choice Specs, but Choice Scarf sets still lose a lot of wallbreaking power overall and can't outspeed Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zeraora, and Tornadus-T. Choice Specs Magnezone can potentially run Analytic as its ability for extreme power, but sacrificing Magnet Pull and Magnezone's primary niche is not recommended. Teleport is another option on the Choice Specs set to pivot on Pokemon immune to Volt Switch. This comes at the cost of a key coverage move, though, and Flash Cannon already heavily dents some Ground-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Magnezone's 4x weakness to Ground and lack of coverage, especially on the Body Press set, make it very hard to break past and avoid revenge killing from Ground-types. Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill all greatly threaten Magnezone with their STAB moves, but they don't appreciate switching into Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon, which lessens their pressure a little bit. Swampert and Gastrodon resist both of its STAB types, making them some of the hardest Ground-types to break immediately.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: With such a low base Speed, middling special bulk, and weaknesses to common attacking types, Magnezone is fairly easy to revenge kill with Pokemon such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Kartana, or any super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Galarian Slowking is one of the best walls to Magnezone, as its high Special Defense, resistance to Body Press, and strong Fire-type coverage allow it to pivot into and take on most Magnezone sets. Blissey and Ferrothorn wall the Choice Specs set but fear the Iron Defense set, meaning they have to scout it first.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu are very sturdy walls against the Iron Defense set and deal decent damage back, but they are extremely vulnerable to a Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon. Ferrothorn, on the other hand, is great against the Choice Specs set but falls easily to the Iron Defense set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Iron Defense": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Defense + Body Press Magnezone traps Pokemon that its STAB moves cannot threaten while also pressuring certain special walls that can switch into its attacks otherwise, such as Blissey. Ferrothorn is the main target, as it is one of the best defensive Steel-types that resists Electric and Steel, but this set is still able to trap typical targets like Skarmory and Corviknight with Thunderbolt. Substitute is very useful to block common status moves such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and get one more hit off after taking down a Steel-type. Toxic allows Magnezone to badly poison switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Swampert that can exploit Magnezone, while Teleport allows for Magnezone to gain momentum against them and other Ground-type Pokemon instead.</p> <p>With how easily Magnezone can remove Skarmory, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn, among other foes, physical setup sweepers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Garchomp, and Dragonite can be much more effective. Iron Defense Magnezone will typically have a hard time breaking through Pokemon that aren't Steel-types due to the lack of offensive investment, meaning it needs strong defensive pivots to help when it gets in a bad position. Teammates like Rotom-W and Slowking can pivot into strong Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Ground-type answers such as Corviknight and Landorus-T can cover Magnezone against attackers like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T. Magnezone also appreciates strong wallbreakers to stop walls from taking momentum after it traps a foe, so Pokemon like Kyurem, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Weavile are good fits to break foes it can't even when boosted.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Magnezone goes all in with its massive Special Attack stat to hit as hard as possible while still trapping important targets. Its decently powerful STAB moves combined with Choice Specs and a Modest nature make it very hard to wall, as Electric-type answers without reliable recovery such as Landorus-T and Garchomp cannot switch into Flash Cannon reliably. Volt Switch is an incredible tool for Magnezone, allowing it to pivot around special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Ferrothorn to bring in stronger wallbreakers against them and chip them for itself later. Its Volt Switch is also very spammable because Flash Cannon deters Ground-types from switching in. Toxic is an unfavorable move to be locked into but is a great midground option against potential switch-ins like specially defensive Hippowdon and Swampert. Body Press lets Magnezone pick off Ferrothorn and Blissey after they've been chipped, and Steel Beam is a very high-risk, high-reward option that can even take down tanks such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking after they've been chipped. Magnezone is fine sacrificing itself with recoil after doing its trapping job. A Modest nature gives Magnezone a big general boost in power and more favorable damage rolls, such as always 2HKOing specially defensive Tyranitar with Flash Cannon. A Timid nature, however, allows Magnezone to outspeed some targets such as defensive Heatran and Scizor.</p> <p>Rillaboom, Tapu Koko, and Mandibuzz are all great VoltTurn partners to let Magnezone continually switch in, especially Rillaboom, which baits in Steel-types for Magnezone to trap. Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Excadrill, and Blissey are some of the toughest walls for this set to break, meaning teammates that can bait in and damage them are greatly appreciated. Tornadus-T is a VoltTurn partner that baits them in to chip them down, and mixed Hex Dragapult is another pivot that burns Ferrothorn and dents Blissey with Dragon Darts instead.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth's great physical bulk, defensive typing, and access to Regenerator make it a physical wall that consistently checks prominent Pokemon such as Zeraora, Garchomp, Kartana, and Urshifu-R. Useful utility moves such as Knock Off, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore relieve Tangrowth's passivity issue and allow it to punish Pokemon such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Kyurem that would otherwise be able to switch in on it. Unfortunately, Tangrowth still has issues against certain physical attackers such as Weavile, Galarian Zapdos, and Buzzwole, and its abysmal special bulk leaves it open to threats such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, Calm Mind Clefable, and Heatran. Tangrowth also is vulnerable to Future Sight, which invalidates its ability to wall Pokemon it would usually check. It also faces stiff competition from Ferrothorn as a defensive Grass-type, as Ferrothorn carries Spikes, which allows it to support its teammates and threaten entry hazard removers with Knock Off. Despite these flaws, Tangrowth is sought out for its better long term matchup against hyper offense teams, as it can constantly regenerate its health to take on these teams' multiple offensive threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazards from overwhelming Tangrowth and limiting Regenerator recovery, which would otherwise make it much easier to wear down. A Choice Specs set with Leaf Storm, Nature Power, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast alongside Tapu Koko can be used to lure in Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Corviknight, and Toxapex, as well as hitting other Pokemon for heavy damage such as bulky Garchomp and opposing Tapu Koko. Sludge Bomb hits opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu, but it isn't as important as the other moves on its set. Tangrowth can opt not to use an item at all to have a better matchup against Knock Off users like Swords Dance Kartana and Rillaboom, notably avoiding an OHKO from a boosted Bisharp or Crawdaunt. Protect acts as extra security for Future Sight Pokemon and is commonly seen on bulkier builds to ensure longevity during the long term.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Volcarona doesn't appreciate switching into Knock Off or a status move, but it can easily get rid of Tangrowth offensively, especially if it is a Safeguard variant, as it doesn't fear status and can burn Tangrowth for using Knock Off with Flame Body. Other Fire-types such as Heatran and Victini are just as threatening, but neither appreciates switching into a Knock Off or status.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While they can't switch in, Ice-types such as Weavile and Kyurem pose a massive threat to Tangrowth, as they can outspeed and deal massive damage to it. The former should be wary of potentially hitting a Rocky Helmet set, especially with Triple Axel, as it will take massive damage as a result.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Once Tangrowth has put a foe to sleep, there are very few options that it has against Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, which easily take Focus Blast. However, the potency of Sleep Powder and Knock Off still discourages them from switching in overall.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Tangrowth's poor special bulk means that strong special attackers such as Kyurem and Tapu Lele, as well as Future Sight users like Slowbro and Slowking, can break through it with relative ease, leaving it unable to effectively deal with physical attackers such as Urshifu-R and Kartana. However, special threats must watch out for Sleep Powder and Knock Off. Other Pokemon such as Life Orb Garchomp and Dragapult can threaten Tangrowth with Fire Blast or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Entry hazards limit the recovery that Tangrowth gets from Regenerator and therefore significantly impede its ability to consistently check Urshifu-R and other physical attackers. Other Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill can carry Toxic and use it to whittle down Tangrowth while mitigating Regenerator's recovery, making it much harder to check them throughout the game.</p>",

Focus Blast mainly serves to hit Steel-types like Kartana, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Bisharp to force them out. Sleep Powder helps with Tangrowth‘s passivity issue by preventing free opposing setup, incapacitating threats, and letting a teammate switch in freely. Stun Spore is an alternative to Sleep Powder that can incapacitate threats permanently, unlike Sleep Powder. Rocky Helmet allows Tangrowth to chip down physical attackers and Pokemon trying to pivot with U-turn such as Rillaboom, Zeraora, Kartana, and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits best on defensive teams that appreciate a bulky Grass-type that can check Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. They also benefit from having a reliable and consistent check to physical attackers, particularly wallbreakers like Bisharp and Urshifu-R, that can force progress with Knock Off and generate opportunities for its teammates. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate it taking on Water- and Grass-types like Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Kartana. Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Gastrodon work well to check most threatening special attackers like Heatran. Tangrowth's meager Special Defense requires having partners that can take on special attackers: specially defensive Heatran and Galarian Slowking are excellent teammates that can take care of Zapdos, Life Orb Clefable, and Tapu Lele. In return, they appreciate Tangrowth taking care of physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R. Slowking can form a Regenerator core with Tangrowth to handle threats like Heatran and Tapu Lele. Having entry hazard removal is very useful, as entry hazard damage can put Tangrowth in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Swords Dance Kartana. Corviknight is a great partner on bulkier builds, as it can alleviate pressure for Tangrowth by checking Rillaboom and Kartana, while Zapdos can check Tornadus-T, which is really good at exploiting Tangrowth‘s low Special Defense. Additional checks to physical attackers that Tangrowth can't handle are also beneficial; Toxapex can take care of Weavile, while Corviknight alongside a revenge killer such as Weavile can stop Swords Dance variants of Garchomp or Landorus-T. Corviknight can also alleviate pressure by helping Tangrowth against Rillaboom + Magnezone cores as well as Grass-type spam cores.</p>"

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W has a smorgasbord of qualities that give it a unique role in the OU metagame. An amazing defensive typing, Levitate removing a key Ground weakness, numerous status inflicting moves in Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, pivoting in Volt Switch, and a form of recovery in Pain Split all allow it to function as an optimal defensive pivot. Unlike other Electric-types that struggle with Ground-types like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone, Rotom-W is able to safely switch into them without fear thanks to Levitate. This synergizes well with its access to STAB Hydro Pump, giving it the ability to wash them away without difficulty. Rotom-W doesn't just have to capitalize on its defensive prowess; it can also use its impressive STAB combination and its access to Nasty Plot to become a bulky setup sweeper that can still switch in on Pokemon like Melmetal, Landorus-T, and Weavile. Despite this, Rotom-W does have some notable flaws. Its recovery is limited to Pain Split, which is entirely dependent on the HP of its opponent, and Leftovers, which gets removed by Knock Off from Pokemon it commonly checks like Landorus-T, Weavile, and Tornadus-T. Rotom-W also faces steep competition from Slowbro, another physically defensive bulky Water-type pivot, with Slowbro having access to more reliable recovery options such as Regenerator and Slack Off instead of Pain Split and Leftovers, access to Future Sight to offensively support its teammates, better physical bulk, and slow pivoting with Teleport to bring frailer teammates in safely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-W is able to slot in Defog over Pain Split because its typing and ability allow it to safely use Defog on Heatran and Landorus-T, giving it a valuable niche over other common Defoggers. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of a status move, since it needs Pain Split for recovery; this massively limits its ability to check threats like Garchomp and Weavile. Rotom-W can opt for a Choice Scarf set with Trick to punish common specially defensive switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Blissey, running maximum Speed investment in order to outspeed Pokemon like Tornadus-T, +1 Speed Dragonite, and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini. However, Rotom-W really appreciates the additional bulk that it has to forego in order to invest in Speed, so it won't be able to take as many attacks. Another hindrance is that Choice Scarf Rotom-W is slower than other common Choice Scarf Pokemon in the tier like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Blacephalon, making it much easier to revenge kill compared to the previous threats mentioned.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom can stomach Rotom-W's attacks and threaten it out but fear Will-O-Wisp. Ferrothorn is a defensive Grass-type that can repeatedly stomach any of Rotom-W's attacks and restore all the chip damage taken through Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery, but it also strongly dislikes Will-O-Wisp neutering its attacking moves, preventing it from inflicting meaningful damage on the threats it wants to check.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Depending on Rotom-W's status condition of choice, offensive Dragon-types are able to switch in safely and set up on it. If running Thunder Wave, Garchomp can come in and threaten it with Swords Dance + Scale Shot. If running Will-O-Wisp, Choice Specs Dragapult can come in and fire off Shadow Balls and Draco Meteors without consequence.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Galarian Slowking, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn are all Pokemon that have excellent special bulk, allowing them to easily switch into Rotom-W even when severely chipped. However, Ferrothorn is prone to getting its Leftovers recovery nullified by Will-O-Wisp, and Gastrodon's longevity is greatly squandered by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Blaziken can overwhelm Rotom-W with Close Combat, and Choice Band Tyranitar mauls it with both of its STAB options. Special attackers like Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Blacephalon can 2HKO it with strong neutral hits.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's main way of cleaning Ground-types like Landorus-T and Excadrill that are immune to Volt Switch and can prevent it from grabbing momentum. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W cripple hard-hitting physical attackers like Melmetal, Weavile, and Garchomp and nullifies Ferrothorn's Leftovers recovery and weakens its attacks. Thunder Wave is able to slow down fast offensive threats like Dragapult, Volcarona, and Tapu Lele. Toxic whittles down defensive walls that can outlast Rotom-W like Gastrodon and Zapdos. Pain Split and Leftovers serve as Rotom-W's semi-reliable forms of recovery, helping it check offensive threats like Garchomp and Heatran and take Stealth Rock chip damage more easily. 132 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed positive Speed nature Aegislash and neutral Speed nature Volcanion and Bisharp, while the defensive investment allows Rotom-W to survive Close Combat from Urshifu-R after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W fits best on VoltTurn balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to maintain and generate momentum against multiple different threats like Heatran, Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Corviknight is an amazing teammate for it on teams like this, since both of them work in tandem with their respective pivoting moves. Corviknight can patch up its matchups against Grass-type wallbreakers like Kartana and Rillaboom, while Rotom-W takes on Fire-types like Heatran and Victini for it. Dragapult is an offensive pivot that is able to lure in Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Heatran, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar in for Rotom-W, and Rotom-W can lure in Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn for it. Landorus-T is another pivot that works well with Rotom-W, since it appreciates Rotom-W being able to switch into Weavile's Ice-type STAB moves as well as checking Tornadus-T, which is able to heavily chip Landorus-T with Hurricane or remove its item, and Volcanion for it. Landorus-T is also able to threaten out Galarian Slowking, one of Rotom-W's best checks, and can check Dragapult and Tapu Koko for it. Melmetal appreciates Rotom-W threatening the likes of Corviknight and Slowbro, while Melmetal can check powerful attackers like Tapu Lele and Choice Band Tyranitar that can overwhelm Rotom-W. Tornadus-T is another great teammate for Rotom-W, being able to take on threats such as Rillaboom and Kartana that force out Rotom-W. It also alleviates the pressure off of Tornadus-T to check Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill. Clefable is a nice teammate, too, since it can help check threats like Weavile and Urshifu-R that can overwhelm Rotom-W and has utility in Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Trick + Sticky Barb, which can gradually wear down opposing Rotom-W checks such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking. Heatran fits well with Rotom-W because it checks threats such as Dragapult and Tapu Lele while also possessing Stealth Rock. In return, Rotom-W is able to check Ground- and Water-types like Landorus-T, Slowking, and Garchomp.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to fantastic utility moves such as Stealth Rock, Magma Storm, Taunt, and Toxic, Heatran is one of the best progress-makers in the metagame. The aforementioned movepool makes it almost impossible to stave off in the long run and allows Heatran to invariably make some kind of foothold for its team whenever it hits the field. Heatran's Fire / Steel dual typing also bestows it with a bevy of key resistances, which is paired with its fantastic natural bulk so it can check some of the strongest offensive threats in the metagame, most notably Tapu Lele, as Heatran resists both Psychic and Fairy. Two incredible abilities in Flash Fire and Flame Body help it check even more of the metagame, with the former stonewalling Volcarona, while the latter allows it to be an annoying stopgap to Weavile as well as punish multi-hit contact moves, such as Double Iron Bash from Melmetal. Despite its lack of reliable recovery and mediocre Speed tier, the guardian of volcanoes is a metagame-defining presence by burning bright in both defense and offense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect can be used on specially defensive sets, especially when paired with a Grassy Terrain setter like Rillaboom or Tapu Bulu, to recover even more HP from Leftovers and Grassy Terrain as well as racking up extra passive damage from Magma Storm and Toxic on Heatran's switch-ins. Nature Power can be run on Grassy Terrain teams to hit Heatran's Water- and Ground-type switch-ins at the cost of a status move. Lava Plume is an alternative Fire-type STAB move if Heatran wants to cripple offensive switch-ins such as Choice Band Tyranitar, but it is generally inferior to Magma Storm, as the latter is important for Heatran to generate progress in most games. Choice Scarf or Choice Specs sets with Eruption, Magma Storm, Earth Power, and Solar Beam or Flash Cannon can be run on sun teams,  as Heatran sits in a decent enough Speed tier to be a somewhat effective Choice Scarf user, and Choice Specs Heatran is difficult to wall due to its high Special Attack stat, but such sets are easily worn down due to lacking defensive investment as well as the passive recovery of Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: With a Fire resistance as well as terrific special bulk under sand to shrug off Earth Power, Tyranitar is a fantastic check to Heatran. Specially defensive Tyranitar variants can stomach a lot of hits and hit Heatran super effectively with Earthquake while making progress with Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. As for Choice Band variants, they can run Superpower or Earthquake to threaten a KO on Heatran while punching holes through its team with Stone Edge or Crunch. However, all variants of Tyranitar are crippled by Toxic and burn from Will-O-Wisp and Lava Plume, while its lack of reliable recovery sentences it to being a medium-term check at best.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini can shrug off Magma Storm while chunking Heatran with their Water-type STAB moves, and Water / Ground types such as Gastrodon and Swampert can even threaten to OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB moves. However, almost every Pokemon in this list is vulnerable to Toxic, except for Tapu Fini, which is easily worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Offensive Water-types such as Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, and Keldeo can switch into Heatran's moves while threatening it out with their strong attacks, but their lack of bulk limits the amount of times they can switch in.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Garchomp, Dragonite, and Hydreigon all resist Magma Storm and threaten to OHKO Heatran with their Ground-type attacks, but it should be noted that Toxic cripples all three, unless Dragonite is carrying Heal Bell, and chip damage from Magma Storm wears down Garchomp in the long run while forcing Hydreigon and Dragonite to lose momentum by using Roost.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon can take hits from Heatran before retaliating with Earthquake or Earth Power for some Gastrodon variants, but they are vulnerable to Toxic and residual damage, while more offensive Ground-types such as Excadrill and Nidoking do not appreciate taking any of Heatran's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Coverage</strong>: Buzzwole, Blaziken, and Galarian Zapdos threaten Heatran with their STAB Fighting-type moves, but they cannot switch into it. Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Rillaboom, Kartana, and Tornadus-T can run Fighting-type coverage to nail Heatran, but they risk missing or activating Flame Body, and they do not appreciate taking Magma Storm in return.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: A neutrality to Stealth Rock, susceptibility to Spikes, and lack of reliable recovery make Heatran vulnerable to residual damage from entry hazards as well as items such as Black Sludge and Sticky Barb from Trick Clefable and Galarian Slowking. When combined with the ubiquity of Knock Off to remove items such as its Leftovers, particularly from Pokemon that Heatran wants to trap or offensively threaten like Clefable, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, Heatran can easily be chipped into range of the strong attackers that it is supposed to check.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With Special Defense investment, Heatran turns into a special tank that can check powerful special attackers such as Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Tapu Lele. Magma Storm is what makes this set tick, as it can trap would-be checks such as Blissey and Toxapex with Taunt support while racking up crucial chip damage on Pokemon like Garchomp and Tapu Fini, which can stomach Heatran's hits while forcing it out with their respective STAB moves. Earth Power is a wonderful coverage move that allows Heatran to hit Toxapex, Blacephalon, Victini, and opposing Heatran super effectively, while Taunt rounds out the trapping strategy by denying its targets recovery and status moves such as Soft-Boiled and Thunder Wave from Blissey and Clefable, Slack Off and Teleport from Slowbro, and Recover from Toxapex. Stealth Rock turns Heatran into one of the most reliable hazard setters in the metagame, as it can beat the majority of Defoggers in the tier, such as Corviknight and Zapdos. If its team has another entry hazard setter, Toxic can be used as an alternative to Stealth Rock to cripple Heatran's long-term checks such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, while Heavy Slam can be run in the fourth moveslot as well if nailing Clefable without risking a Magma Storm miss is desirable. Heavy Slam also takes out Steel-weak Pokemon that Heatran checks like Tapu Lele and Weavile. The EV spread above allows Heatran to outspeed uninvested Buzzwole while maximizing special bulk. Please note that when using Heavy Slam, a Sassy nature should be used so Heavy Slam is not weakened against targets like Clefable and Tapu Lele. Heatran should run Flash Fire if it desires to blank Volcarona and cause other Fire-type threats such as Victini and Blacephalon to second-guess their moves. Otherwise, Flame Body is incredibly effective against physical threats that Heatran's typing naturally checks such as Weavile, Rillaboom, and Kartana.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types are natural partners for Heatran, as they resist two of its most glaring weaknesses: Water and Ground. Rillaboom is an exemplary teammate, as it sets up Grassy Terrain, which weakens Earthquake as well as providing Heatran with another form of passive recovery. Besides hitting Water- and Ground-types super effectively, Rillaboom also provides Knock Off and U-turn support, the former of which removes Heavy-Duty Boots and makes its switch-ins take damage from Heatran's Stealth Rock, while the latter gives Heatran safe switch-in opportunities. Kartana is another Grass-type that appreciates Heatran taking on Zapdos and Tornadus-T, while it can threaten Tyranitar and Urshifu-R in return. Naturally, Pokemon that resist Fighting, such as Slowbro and Zapdos, are also great teammates: Slowbro in particular comes with the bonus of checking or threatening Ground- and Water-types such as Garchomp and Urshifu-R. Clefable and Gastrodon are also noteworthy defensive partners: Clefable can take on Dragonite and Buzzwole, while Heatran can handle Pokemon that trouble Clefable, such as Victini and Volcarona; Gastrodon forms a strong defensive core with Heatran, preventing Heatran from being worn down by taking repeated attacks from Choice Specs Dragapult and Blacephalon, while Heatran can take on Tapu Lele. Gastrodon also stonewalls Rotom-W, which greatly annoys Heatran, as Rotom-W resists Magma Storm and is immune to Earth Power while being able to hit Heatran super effectively with its STAB Hydro Pump. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate the progress Heatran makes throughout the course of a game form potent offensive cores with Heatran. Dragapult can take advantage of Toxic support against Hippowdon and Gastrodon, Weavile benefits from Heatran trapping Toxapex, and Tapu Lele loves Heatran crippling bulky Psychic-types like Slowking with Toxic or trapping special walls like Blissey. Spikes synergizes extremely well with Heatran's Stealth Rock, as both entry hazards can combine to take away over a third of a grounded Pokemon's health upon switching in. This makes Ferrothorn and Skarmory excellent partners, as Heatran can take on Fire-types such as Victini, Blacephalon, and Volcarona for them. In return, Skarmory stonewalls Ground-types such as Garchomp and Hippowdon, while Ferrothorn serves as a sturdy stopgap against Water-types like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W. Ferrothorn can also be a secondary Fairy-type check against the likes of Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko, preventing Heatran from being overwhelmed.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set turns Heatran into a physically defensive tank that can take hits from some of the most dangerous physical threats in the metagame, such as Weavile, Melmetal, and Rillaboom. Magma Storm allows Heatran to accumulate chip damage on checks like Garchomp and Landorus-T that can immediately force it out. Earth Power provides Heatran great coverage to hit Pokemon that resist Magma Storm, such as opposing Toxapex, Volcanion, and opposing Heatran. Protect is an alternative if Heatran desires to accumulate extra rounds of passive recovery if running Leftovers, as well as scouting moves like Superpower from Melmetal and Low Kick from Weavile. If running Protect, Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are great status options in the third moveslot: Toxic puts long-term switch-ins such as Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Dragonite on a timer, while Will-O-Wisp cripples more offensive checks such as Swords Dance Garchomp, Choice Band Tyranitar, and Urshifu-R. Taunt should be run instead if Heatran wishes to maximize its trapping capabilities with Magma Storm and Earth Power, as it allows Heatran to trap and remove passive switch-ins like Blissey and Toxapex. Finally, Stealth Rock is a great fourth move, as Heatran is one of the best entry hazard setters in the metagame with the ability to beat some of the best Defoggers in the tier, like Zapdos and Corviknight. With 20 Speed EVs, Heatran outspeeds uninvested Buzzwole, while the rest of the investment is dumped into HP and Defense to maximize physical bulk, allowing it to check physical threats like Weavile and Melmetal. Faster EV spreads can be considered if running Will-O-Wisp to get the jump on Pokemon like Choice Band Tyranitar that would otherwise obliterate Heatran with Earthquake or Superpower, while mixed defensive spreads can also be run on offensive teams to be more of a blanket check against special and physical threats, such as Tapu Lele and Weavile, respectively. Flame Body allows Heatran to punish contact moves such as Double Iron Bash from Melmetal, Knock Off from Weavile and Kartana, and U-turn from Rillaboom. It also allows Heatran to fish for burn against predicted U-turns from foes like Landorus-T and Urshifu-R that it would otherwise never stay or come in on, making pivoting more difficult for foes. Air Balloon is preferred on more offensive teams that enjoy Heatran blanking Ground-types like specially defensive Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon short-term so it can set up Stealth Rock or spread status with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, but Leftovers is a viable alternative if Heatran desires the longevity the item provides by slowly healing off the damage it accumulates over the course of a match with the switches it forces.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically defensive Heatran is mainly used on offensive teams that want a Steel-type alternative to Melmetal, as Heatran can force progress more effectively with its access to Stealth Rock and incredible movepool. Flame Body also allows Heatran to fish for burn on physical attackers, generating opportunities for offensive teammates to come in and take advantage of a weakened threat. Therefore, offensive partners that can take advantage of the progress Heatran generates make for wonderful teammates. Rillaboom is an exemplary teammate for physically defensive Heatran, as the Grassy Terrain it sets up weakens Earthquake, allowing Heatran to either set up Stealth Rock or use a status move in front of Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp without fearing a KO. Heatran also loves the passive recovery Grassy Terrain provides, especially if running Protect. Moreover, Rillaboom's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off allows Heatran's Stealth Rock to inflict damage on its switch-ins, such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, especially since most of them are weak to Stealth Rock. Weavile is another offensive Pokemon that has good synergy with Heatran, as it can threaten out Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T while offensively checking Dragapult. As for defensive teammates, Zapdos and Tornadus-T are great partners, as they can deal with Fighting- and Ground-types like Buzzwole and Landorus-T while appreciating Heatran's ability to check Weavile. Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Tapu Fini can share the burden of checking physical threats like Melmetal and Weavile while being a stopgap against Volcanion and Barraskewda, Pokemon that threaten Heatran with their Water-type STAB moves. Moreoever, Rotom-W is a sturdy Garchomp and Landorus-T check with its access to Levitate and Will-O-Wisp, while Tapu Fini can either revenge kill Dragapult with Choice Scarf sets or reliably take hits from it with bulkier Calm Mind and Whirlpool sets. Specially defensive Pokemon are great defensive partners, as this Heatran set does not have the investment to check special threats such as Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Volcarona. Specially defensive Landorus-T is a wonderful teammate, as it checks all four aforementioned Pokemon with its special bulk and ability to deal big damage with its strong Earthquake or remove their items with Knock Off. Gastrodon is a great alternative on bulkier builds, as its typing and access to reliable recovery allow it to stymie the aforementioned threats in the long run. Secondary Fairy-type checks such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking are also appreciated, as most of the tier's Fairy-types are specially oriented, such as Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele. Ferrothorn deserves a special mention, as Spikes lets it form an entry hazard-stacking core with Heatran's Stealth Rock, wearing down grounded switch-ins to Heatran like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp immensely.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Heatran leverages its high Special Attack and decent Speed tier to be one of the tier's best bulky wallbreakers with this set. Magma Storm combines high Base Power with trapping and residual damage that chips away at switch-ins like Rotom-W, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Earth Power hits Pokemon that resist Magma Storm, such as Toxapex, Tyranitar, and opposing Heatran, for super effective damage, giving Heatran great coverage. Taunt in combination with the aforementioned two moves allows Heatran to trap and remove passive switch-ins like Toxapex and Blissey by preventing them from healing. Eruption does not risk the chance of missing like Magma Storm, allowing Heatran to spam it when healthy to punch holes through teams. Toxic is an alternative if putting long-term checks to Heatran like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Dragonite on a timer is desirable. Stealth Rock can also be run in this moveslot if Heatran wants to take advantage of the switches it forces to set up entry hazards. This works particularly well, since Heatran is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the metagame, capable of forcing out Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Clefable while pressuring some of the tier's best Defoggers in Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tornadus-T. Air Balloon lets Heatran take advantage of Ground-types that only have Earthquake as an attacking move, such as specially defensive Garchomp and Hippowdon. 4 Defense EVs ensure that Heatran can survive Sacred Sword from unboosted Kartana after Stealth Rock. Offensive Heatran's nature depends on what threats it wants to beat: it can run a Timid nature to outspeed Modest Nidoking and Choice Band Rillaboom, while a Modest nature gives it a guaranteed OHKO on Corviknight and a 2HKO on Hippowdon with Eruption. Flash Fire can be used if Heatran desires to leverage its amazing defensive typing to stymie Volcarona and make Pokemon like Victini, Blacephalon, and opposing Heatran second-guess their moves, as offensive Heatran can deal outrageous damage with its Fire-type moves with a Flash Fire boost. However, Flame Body allows it to punish contact moves such as Knock Off from Weavile, U-turn from Landorus-T and Tornadus-T, and Double Iron Bash from Melmetal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Heatran fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking prowess. Slowbro is a wonderful teammate, as it can take on powerful Water-types like Urshifu-R and Barraskewda and bring Heatran onto the field safely with Teleport. Moreoever, Slowbro holds the distinction of being a solid check to offensive Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T with its good bulk and STAB Scald. Tornadus-T and Zapdos can also check the aforementioned Ground-types while having pivoting moves in U-turn and Volt Switch to provide safe entry for Heatran. Furthermore, they can be the first line of defense against Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana to preserve Heatran's health. Rillaboom also pairs incredibly well with offensive Heatran: it greatly pressures rain teams with Grassy Glide, can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Defoggers like Zapdos and Tornadus-T so they take damage from Heatran's Stealth Rock, and even sets up Grassy Terrain, which provides passive recovery for Heatran once its Air Balloon is popped, increasing the number of times it can enter the field to wallbreak. Grassy Terrain also weakens Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake, so Heatran can stay in on Pokemon like Landorus-T and Garchomp to put them on a timer with Toxic without fearing a KO when Grassy Terrain is active. As Heatran's Speed is quite mediocre, it appreciates teammates that can force out faster threats, making Dragapult, Weavile, and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Urshifu-R good offensive partners. Weavile and Kartana notably synergize well with Heatran's Stealth Rock, as Weavile can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Buzzwole and Toxapex, while Kartana can do the same to Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Since offensive Heatran lacks the bulk investment to take on threats that its defensive sets can check, such as Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Weavile, a secondary Steel-type like Ferrothorn or Melmetal is recommended. Ferrothorn deserves a special mention, as Spikes lets form an entry hazard-stacking core with Heatran's Stealth Rock, which can wear down Heatran's grounded switch-ins like Tapu Fini and Garchomp extremely quickly.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Victini's extremely strong V-create along with its wide variety of coverage moves to break through V-create switch-ins make it a decent wallbreaker in the tier. Bolt Strike and Glaciate lets it hit Slowking, Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and give it unresisted coverage in conjunction with V-create. Victini's typing and decent bulk allow it to offensively check Tapu Lele, Scizor, Volcarona, and Calm Mind Clefable, and it offers utility as a pivot with U-turn. However, Victini is heavily reliant on V-create to properly wallbreak because running Heavy-Duty Boots sacrifices a power-boosting item, and the move's stat drops let foes easily revenge kill it. Victini needs good prediction to get the most out of it, and its Speed tier lets faster threat like Weavile, Dragapult, and Zeraora revenge kill it, though it is fast enough to dissuade other threats like Landorus-T and Urshifu-R.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Victini can run a Choice Scarf set with Final Gambit to lure in the likes of Heatran, Toxapex, and Dragonite and remove them with ease. It can also run a Choice Band set; however, being locked into a move can make it vulnerable with the prevalence of Heatran and Ground-types in the tier, and entry hazard damage wears it down rather easily. Energy Ball with a Hasty nature can be used to threaten Gastrodon and Quagsire that may otherwise easily sponge the rest of Victini's moves. An alternative EV spread of 212 Atk / 44 Def / 252 Spe lets Victini survive a Knock Off from Jolly Weavile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, physically defensive Toxapex, and Rotom-W are able to pivot into Victini's attacks, and Toxapex is able to wear Victini down with Rocky Helmet as well as use Knock Off or Toxic.

        "description": "<p>Bolt Strike hits Toxapex and Slowking hard, as well hitting Heatran for a decent amount. Glaciate hits Ground-types that can otherwise switch into it like Garchomp and Landorus-T. Encore can be used instead to take advantage of Pokemon like Clefable, Toxapex, and Landorus-T, locking them into a passive moves like recovery or entry hazard and giving Victini a free turn to attack. It also helps handle Calm Mind Clefable and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp allows Victini to cripple Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Scorching Sands is yet another option used to nail Heatran, but Bolt Strike does a decent amount to Heatran already. U-turn gives Victini momentum and lets it pivot out against Heatran and Tyranitar, which are usually able to take on its other attacks. Jolly is the preferred nature instead of Hasty, since Glaciate's targets will still be 2HKOed even with the Special Attack drop.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a great partner, as they both are able to overwhelm their shared checks, and Tapu Koko enjoys Victini's coverage handling most of its switch-ins while also forming a pivoting core with Victini. Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain support strengthens Bolt Strike, helping Victini to beat Slowking and Slowbro on its own. Urshifu-R and Weavile pair nicely with Victini, as they both enjoy Victini removing or weakening their checks like Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Corviknight, which helps the former wallbreak and the latter sweep. Tapu Fini is able to switch into Heatran and Tyranitar for Victini and provides Misty Terrain so it doesn't get statused while also appreciating Victini weakening Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Blissey. Buzzwole, Corviknight, and Tornadus-T are able to switch into Grass-type attacks from Rillaboom and Kartana as well as Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon for it. Buzzwole in particular is able to switch into Ground- and Grass-types and isn't weak to Knock Off, being able to cover a majority of Victini's weaknesses. Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn can chip down Heatran and Toxapex into range of Victini's attacks.</p>"

Rock Slide also gives Excadrill incredible coverage, enabling it to hit checks like Zapdos and Pelipper. However, as Pokemon like Slowbro and Buzzwole possess the physical bulk to take its moves even after a Swords Dance and threaten it back with their STAB moves, while Pokemon like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Rotom-W can stonewall Excadrill due to their defensive typings.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Excadrill can opt for a Choice Band with Earthquake, Iron Head, Rock Slide, and Rapid Spin, which lets it 2HKO Zapdos outright and 2HKO Ferrothorn and Slowbro after slight chip damage; however, it doesn't appreciate being Choice-locked. Excadrill can also function as a suicide lead, holding a Focus Sash with a moveset of Earthquake, Rapid Spin, Steel Beam, and Stealth Rock, though Landorus-T and Mew typically function better as suicide leads. Excadrill can use Mold Breaker to ignore Levitate on Rotom-W, Unaware on Quagsire, and Multiscale on Dragonite, though it is very niche otherwise. This set is usually specially defensive to check Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele more effectively, but it is not recommended due to its severe lack of longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro can tank hits from Excadrill even after a Swords Dance and can threaten it with Scald or Body Press. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake, resists Iron Head, and doesn't mind taking Rock Slide while threatening to OHKO Excadrill with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T takes hits from Excadrill reasonably well thanks to Intimidate, Hippowdon's great natural bulk lets it eat hits from Excadrill, and both of them can threaten it with Earthquake in retaliation.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Threats like Dragapult, Blacephalon, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R all outspeed Excadrill outside of sand and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Choice Band Urshifu-R can OHKO Excadrill with Aqua Jet after slight chip damage, Rillaboom can OHKO it with Grassy Glide either at +2 or with a Choice Band, and Weavile can take out Excadrill with Ice Shard if it is at very low HP.</p> <p><strong>Non-Ground-weak Steel-types</strong>: Corviknight and Skarmory are immune to Earthquake and don't take much damage from Rock Slide.

      "Sand Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its high Attack stat further bolstered by Swords Dance, solid offensive typing, and access to Sand Rush, Excadrill functions as an extremely dangerous sand sweeper. Swords Dance enables Excadrill to sweep entire teams, allowing it to OHKO Dragapult, Melmetal, and Urshifu-R at +2 with Earthquake. Iron Head, on top of being a STAB move, OHKOes Weavile and Tapu Lele while 2HKOing Clefable, whereas Rock Slide hits Zapdos and Pelipper while OHKOing Volcarona. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill remove entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes, which is particularly notable due to the lack of spinblockers that can stomach Earthquake in the tier, its ability to not activate Defiant from Defog punishers such as Galarian Zapdos and Bisharp, and the moveset flexibility it provides to teammates like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Rapid Spin also boosts its Speed, letting it sweep without sand and outspeed Zeraora and Dragapult at +1 in conjunction with a Jolly nature. Leftovers heals off chip damage from hazards, allowing Excadrill to take hits from the likes of Dragapult and Weavile in a pinch while checking Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos without Heat Wave more effectively, whereas Air Balloon lets it set up on Ground-types like specially defensive Garchomp, opposing Excadrill, and Hippowdon in addition to making it immune to Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Excadrill is mainly used on sand teams due to its ability Sand Rush, letting it sweep much more easily and provide valuable speed control for sand teams. Tyranitar is an exemplary teammate for Excadrill, as it reliably sets up sand with Sand Stream and can support it in a variety of ways depending on its set; Choice Band variants help pressure stall teams that depend on Corviknight or Skarmory to stave off Excadrill while pressuring shared checks like Buzzwole against other structures, while specially defensive sets help wear down checks like Corviknight, Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Buzzwole with Stealth Rock and status from Thunder Wave or Toxic. Alternatively, Hippowdon is another solid sand setter, allowing Excadrill to fit on bulkier archetypes due to it being a bulky Ground-type with reliable recovery and access to Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn pairs extremely well with Excadrill, as it is a Steel-type that can check threats like Weavile and Tapu Lele, compensating for Excadrill's inability to reliably check those threats due to its lack of bulk. Ferrothorn also provides entry hazard support with Stealth Rock or Spikes, and it can remove items from the likes of Corviknight, Skarmory, and Buzzwole with Knock Off while being one of the better checks in the tier to Rotom-W. Clefable's Magic Guard ability makes it immune to sand chip damage and a good switch-in to Scald users like Slowbro and Gastrodon while also being another option to set Stealth Rock; in return, Excadrill threatens checks to Clefable like Galarian Slowking and Melmetal. Zapdos threatens checks like Slowbro, Buzzwole, Corviknight, and Skarmory for Excadrill, takes hits from Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom and can wear down bulky Ground-types that can trade with Excadrill in a pinch, such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Garchomp; in exchange, Excadrill threatens Weavile and Tapu Lele, and its Rapid Spin allows Zapdos to run moves like Heat Wave and Toxic instead of Defog. Tornadus-T aids Excadrill by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from checks like Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T, while Excadrill can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock that Tornadus-T despises without Heavy-Duty Boots, letting it run Assault Vest or Nasty Plot sets. Tapu Lele threatens Rotom-W and Buzzwole, prevents Excadrill from being hit by Weavile's Ice Shard and Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet, offers Future Sight support, and is a solid form of speed control outside of sand if running a Choice Scarf set. In return, Excadrill threatens checks to Tapu Lele such as Heatran and Galarian Slowking. Urshifu-R threatens Landorus-T and Ferrothorn as well as being able to revenge kill Blaziken with Aqua Jet, which can easily tear through sand teams, while Excadrill can threaten Urshifu-R's checks like Clefable and Toxapex. Moreover, they can wear down Slowbro, Corviknight, and Skarmory together.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is a valuable defensive piece for a variety of offensive and defensive teams. While Leech Seed is its main recovery move, giving it issues with longevity, it's still a fantastic check to physical attackers such as Weavile, Melmetal, and Tyranitar. It also has good enough special bulk to take hits from Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele. Its fantastic typing with many valuable resistances helps it check both physical and special attackers. One of its most valuable attributes, however, is that it is a solid Spikes setter, which is a fantastic means to support the rest of its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band is occasionally seen to take advantage of Ferrothorn's high Attack stat with powerful Gyro Balls and Power Whips, especially on Trick Room teams. However, Ferrothorn's low Speed and lack of useful coverage mean it struggles to have a meaningful impact. Iron Defense can be used alongside Body Press to make Ferrothorn a late-game setup sweeper. However, this is very clunky, and even boosted Body Presses can be easily handled by Ghost-types and Pokemon like Clefable and Zapdos that resist them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Every Fire-type in the metagame, such as Volcanion, Victini, Volcarona, Blacephalon, and Heatran, obliterates Ferrothorn, as does every Fire-type coverage move, like Dragapult and Clefable's Flamethrower and Zapdos's Heat Wave. Fire-types typically have to fear switching in, however, due to Knock Off and Thunder Wave. Knock Off can remove their Heavy-Duty Boots and make them take huge chip damage from Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, while Thunder Wave greatly hinders the Blacephalon's wallbreaking power and  Volcarona's sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Buzzwole, Blaziken, and Urshifu-R, while bothered by Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet, easily break through Ferrothorn. Coverage moves like Superpower from Melmetal and Focus Blast from Tapu Lele are also significant issues for Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: While other entry hazards fail to bother Ferrothorn whatsoever, Spikes, especially in multiple layers, reduce Ferrothorn's longevity to an embarrassingly high degree, allowing threats it would typically wall like Weavile to easily break through it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Ferrothorn's only recovery option being Leech Seed means it can be easily worn down over time by chip damage. For instance, repeated neutral attacks like Landorus-T's Earthquake and Weavile's Knock Off can wear Ferrothorn down to the point where it cannot perform its needed defensive duties.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Zapdos</strong>: Both Corviknight and Zapdos take very little damage from Ferrothorn, can easily use Defog to remove its Spikes, and deal damage back with Body Press and Heat Wave or Hurricane, respectively. Corviknight does have to beware of Body Press when using Roost, and neither particularly wants to take a Leech Seed or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Substitute Magnezone sets are able to set up a Substitute on Ferrothorn, boost their Defense with Iron Defense, and eventually break through with Body Press. In combination with Magnet Pull, this allows Magnezone to trap and remove Ferrothorn.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is one of the few Pokemon that learns Spikes in the metagame and can support its team immensely with them. Stealth Rock can be run if the team lacks another entry hazard setter, but the opportunity cost of not having Spikes is very high. Multiple layers of Spikes can quickly wear down walls like Tapu Fini, Melmetal, and Heatran. Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's only viable recovery move and can provide valuable chip damage on switch-ins like Heatran for its teammates, force switches to stop its HP drain, and heal allies as they come in. The remaining moveslots are heavily team-dependent. Power Whip is often Ferrothorn's strongest attack and particularly eliminates Water-types like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W, while Body Press allows it to hit Steel-types such as opposing Ferrothorn, Heatran, Melmetal, and Kartana. Importantly, Body Press chunks Heatran as it comes in, which can be huge for many of Ferrothorn's common teammates. Gyro Ball is its best option versus Fairy-types like Tapu Lele while also dealing huge damage to speedy threats such as Dragapult and Tornadus-T. Both it and Body Press notably OHKO Weavile. Knock Off allows Ferrothorn to remove the omnipresent Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T and Leftovers from Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Clefable. It can also punish Dragapult and Blacephalon for switching in. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can slow down Pokemon such as Dragapult and Tornadus-T on the switch, enabling Ferrothorn's teammates to take advantage of them. It can also be used against more defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Melmetal to allow Ferrothorn or its teammates to fish for a devastating full paralysis.</p> <p>Iron Barbs allows Ferrothorn to punish physical attackers such as Weavile and Urshifu-R that make contact with it. Leftovers offers more recovery to Ferrothorn for prolonged games, while Rocky Helmet doubles up with Iron Barbs to make anything that makes contact with Ferrothorn regret it. An Impish nature maximizes Ferrothorn's Defense, but a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are correct if running Gyro Ball to maximize damage. The spread maximizes Ferrothorn's physical bulk, although it is very customizable if a particular benchmark is desired.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Urshifu-R that struggle to break grounded walls lacking Heavy-Duty Boots such as Heatran and Tapu Fini appreciate Ferrothorn for its ability to wear down their checks with Spikes. Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R also appreciate that Ferrothorn can use Thunder Wave to paralyze faster Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Dragapult to better enable them to wallbreak. Powerful wallbreakers like Nidoking and Tapu Lele work well with the entry hazards Ferrothorn sets, as they force switches, meaning Ferrothorn's Spikes chip down the opposing team, including their checks. Knock Off users such as Clefable and Weavile also support Ferrothorn well by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Slowbro and Blissey. Toxapex and other Water-types like Gastrodon and Slowbro are fantastic teammates defensively, covering Ferrothorn's weaknesses to Fire- and Fighting-types such as Volcanion and Urshifu-R. Ground-types like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Gastrodon cover Ferrothorn's main enemy in Heatran, while Ferrothorn effectively deals with one of their biggest concerns in Weavile.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Mandibuzz's typing separates it from other defensive Flying-types through its ability to check Dragapult. Its great bulk and access to Roost also allow it to check common threats like Rillaboom and Kartana. It is a good Defog user, with Foul Play pressuring common Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T and defensive Garchomp, although it loses to them in the long run due to their moves like Toxic and Knock Off. Foul Play also discourages physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom, Kartana, Dragapult, and Excadrill from setting up. Since it is reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots, Pokemon that it otherwise reliably checks, like Kartana and Rillaboom, can pressure it more effectively after using Knock Off. Due to the number of threats it can check, it can often be overwhelmed during the course of a match, which forces it to use Roost very often. Its reliance on Foul Play to check certain threats can leave it rather passive as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mandibuzz with Toxic over Defog can work on teams with pre-existing forms of entry hazard control. This set is very good at annoying and punishing opposing Mandibuzz, Kyurem, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos, which can take advantage of it switching in. Whirlwind can be a good choice over U-turn to stop Mandibuzz from being setup fodder against sweepers like Volcarona, Tapu Fini, and Reuniclus. Taunt is also a good option over U-turn, since it can also prevent setup and stop Pokemon from setting entry hazards on Mandibuzz; it additionally allows Mandibuzz to win PP wars even though common entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes have more PP than Defog. However, without U-turn, Mandibuzz becomes a lot more passive and can be taken advantage of by Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Kyurem.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Electric-types</strong>: Offensive Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko can force out and pressure Mandibuzz very well with their STAB moves, and Tapu Koko can switch in for free, but Zeraora dislikes Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ice-types</strong>: Offensive Ice-types like Kyurem and Weavile can threaten to KO or set up on Mandibuzz, as they force it out and can find opportunities to switch in as it uses Defog. However, both of them dislike switching into Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Pokemon that Mandibuzz can check like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp often carry Toxic, which they can use as it pivots in, hurting its longevity. Toxic also forces it to use Roost more often, which can deplete its PP more quickly and give it less opportunities to use Defog. Other status conditions like burn and paralysis, especially from Dragapult, can hurt its ability to check threats as well. Status chip damage, along with weaker attacks like U-turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Rillaboom, can be enough to overwhelm Mandibuzz.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Some Pokemon that Mandibuzz is able to check like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Kartana carry Knock Off, which is extremely detrimental because it can be left unable to wall certain threats after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon's high Special Attack and wide movepool give it unique power to punch holes by threatening common defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Heatran, and defensive Landorus-T. This is further complemented by its decent Speed allowing it to outpace common offensive Pokemon such as offensive Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Tapu Lele. On top of all this, Hydreigon's defensive typing, ability, and Roost let it check Heatran extremely effectively and come in on slower defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowking with ease. However, although Hydreigon has passable Speed, it is still outpaced and OHKOed by common Pokemon such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Tapu Koko. It will also often be checked by some Pokemon such as Fairy-types, which it struggles to break through without Flash Cannon, and Blissey, which it can't do much to without Nasty Plot boosts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydreigon's movepool has options to cover certain defensive Pokemon at the cost of the neutral coverage its listed options provide; for instance, Superpower lets Hydreigon lure in Blissey and 2HKO it. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a decent offensive pivot with U-turn and can also function as a revenge killer, but it oftentimes doesn't want to be locked into any of its attacks. Substitute improves Hydreigon's matchup versus offensive teams, as it eases prediction when forcing switches, as well as scouting Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T. Substitute also allows Hydreigon to shield itself from status effects from Pokemon such as Toxapex. A bulkier set with Defog is a viable option to check Heatran even better, as well as other Pokemon such as Blacephalon, but it is passive and overall very niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Hydreigon's 4x weakness to Fairy makes Pokemon of this type solid checks to it. Clefable and Tapu Fini can survive any attack from full health and OHKO or heavily damage Hydreigon in return; however, Clefable is OHKOed by +2 Flash Cannon, and Tapu Fini can become too worn down to be able to pivot into Hydreigon's attacks. Rarer Unaware Clefable sets tend to check it better. Tapu Koko easily outspeeds Hydreigon and OHKOes it, although it can't pivot into Earth Power. The rarer Choice Scarf Tapu Fini also outpaces Hydreigon and OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can tank just about any attack Hydreigon uses, up to a +4 Life Orb Draco Meteor, and cripple it with status or use Teleport to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Kartana and Tornadus-T can easily outpace Hydreigon and pick it off if it is chipped a little bit. Weavile can outpace and OHKO Hydreigon, while Zeraora can also pick off a chipped Hydreigon. Common Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Sand Rush-boosted Dracozolt, and Garchomp all outpace Hydreigon. The former two can easily OHKO with Draco Meteor, while Garchomp can potentially OHKO it with Life Orb-boosted Scale Shot.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Hydreigon is prone to being worn down by status effects from Pokemon it commonly pivots against, such as Toxapex and Slowbro. This is also compounded by how often in can pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm. Because of this damage, Hydreigon can be pressured into using Roost too often.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Hawlucha, and Galarian Zapdos can all pivot into Hydreigon's attacks due to the rarity of Draco Meteor and OHKO it. Pokemon that run Fighting-type coverage, such as Rillaboom and Aegislash, which Hydreigon should be otherwise able to pivot into, threaten it as well.</p>",

Draco Meteor can be used over Flash Cannon or Earth Power to heavily dent most Pokemon, better pressure Mandibuzz as well as defensive Dragonite, and OHKO Urshifu-R, although the Special Attack drop usually forces Hydreigon to switch out after. Flamethrower can also be used over either coverage move to better pressure Corviknight. Life Orb is the best item for this set, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Heatran as well as 2HKO Clefable and Slowking. However, if your team needs Hydreigon's defensive capabilities, Leftovers lets it stay around longer, pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm more consistently, and negate burn damage from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowbro.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana put both Ferrothorn and Corviknight in 2HKO range of Dark Pulse by using Knock Off as they switch in; in return, Hydreigon offers a consistent switch-in to Heatran, which can be especially helpful if either one of them is Choice locked into a Grass-type move. Zeraora and Dragapult, when paired with Hydreigon, can overwhelm shared checks such as Clefable and Ferrothorn. Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Heatran can check Fairy-types and appreciate Hydreigon checking Heatran; Heatran can also help overwhelm Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Pivots that can bring Hydreigon safely are solid teammates as well; Tapu Koko can lure in Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon and use U-turn to bring Hydreigon in. Corviknight is another U-turn pivot that can lure in Rotom-W and Toxapex for Hydreigon. Slowking and Blissey can also pivot with Teleport, and Slowking can help overwhelm foes with Future Sight in combination with Hydreigon's attacks; the two also have decent defensive synergy with Hydreigon. Toxapex has good defensive synergy with Hydreigon and appreciates it stopping Heatran from trapping it. Clefable appreciates Hydreigon checking Heatran and can even heal status effects from it, like Toxic poison from Heatran and Toxapex, with Aromatherapy.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot grants Hydreigon absurd wallbreaking capabilities, allowing it to fully overwhelm Pokemon such as Scizor and Corviknight. Dark Pulse is the primary attack thanks to its decent coverage and power, hitting Pokemon such as Corviknight, Zapdos, and Landorus-T. Earth Power is a coverage option that immediately threatens Heatran and lets Hydreigon break through Tyranitar after a Nasty Plot boost, although Flash Cannon can potentially OHKO Clefable after a Nasty Plot boost and still hit Tyranitar super effectively. Roost is crucial to help Hydreigon better function as a stallbreaker as well as pivot into Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowbro consistently. Life Orb gives Hydreigon a noticeable boost to its power, allowing it to OHKO Corviknight and Clefable with one boost. However, Leftovers is a viable choice to improve its longevity, as Hydreigon still has decent power after a boost and may appreciate pivoting better and possibly setting up on the aforementioned Heatran and Slowbro. Hydreigon can opt for a Modest nature for more power, hitting benchmarks such as a guaranteed OHKO on Clefable with +2 Flash Cannon, although it loses out on the ability to outpace many notable Pokemon such as Tapu Lele. Draco Meteor is an option over Earth Power or Flash Cannon, as it has absurd power after a Nasty Plot boost, although its Special Attack drops and lack of coverage hinder it as an option. Focus Blast and Flamethrower are also viable options in that third moveslot to better pressure Ferrothorn as well as either Tyranitar and Blissey or Corviknight, respectively, although they have little use outside of this.</p> <p>Pivots such as Landorus-T and Slowking can lure in Corviknight and Ferrothorn, respectively, to pivot out and bring Hydreigon in. Depending on whether Hydreigon forgoes Earth Power or Flash Cannon, it will be fully checked by either Tapu Koko or Clefable; this makes Galarian Slowking a decent teammate, as it can stomach attacks from these Pokemon. Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to punish Steel-type switch-ins such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Ironically, Corviknight and Skarmory make for decent teammates, as they can check Garchomp and Kartana; Corviknight, once again, can lure in Pokemon such as Zapdos and bring in Hydreigon with U-turn, while Skarmory can provide Spikes to wear down Hydreigon's checks such as Tapu Fini. Cleaners such as Rillaboom and Weavile appreciate Hydreigon pressuring and softening up common defensive cores such as Corviknight + Slowking early-game.</p>"

      "Offensive Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Volcarona is a dangerous sweeper in OU, using the excellent Quiver Dance to boost and sweep through teams. Flamethrower is generally the preferred Fire-type STAB move for its accuracy, but Fire Blast is a viable option, as its higher power allows Volcarona to OHKO Pokemon like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T, offensive Landorus-T, and, with Stealth Rock chip damage, Tapu Lele after a Quiver Dance boost. Bug Buzz provides a secondary STAB move that hits Tyranitar, Slowbro, and Slowking hard while being its best move against Garchomp, one of Volcarona's best counters. Psychic allows Volcarona to not be completely walled by Toxapex and hits Dragapult harder than any other common move, with +1 Psychic under Psychic Terrain having a chance to outright OHKO physically defensive Toxapex. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to threaten other walls like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini while allowing Volcarona to gain back crucial HP at the cost of letting Toxapex get free turns against it. Volcarona's main issue is that its easily shut down by many staples like specially defensive Garchomp, Blissey, and most notably Flash Fire Heatran, which completely shuts down Volcarona, making it an inconsistent sweeper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Quiver Dance Volcarona fits on offense teams that can overwhelm Volcarona's counters or use the threat of its sweep to make threats like Heatran, Dragonite, and Toxapex think twice before being used to answer its teammates. Tapu Lele appreciates Volcarona forcing Heatran to be conservative with answering it and being a great Melmetal and emergency Kartana answer, while Psychic Terrain boosts Volcarona's Psychic to hit Toxapex harder and allows Volcarona to avoid Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet. Choice Specs Tapu Lele is especially good for its extra breaking power against the slow teams that are more capable of packing Volcarona's counters such as Toxapex, Blissey, and specially defensive Garchomp. Swords Dance Garchomp acts as a more reliable sweeper and is one of the best answers to Heatran in OU while having a STAB Earthquake to break through Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Galarian Slowking and also potentially serving as a Stealth Rock setter. In return, Garchomp appreciates Volcarona's ability to threaten its checks like Rillaboom, Weavile, and Buzzwole, while Flame Body can potentially cripple the aforementioned Pokemon in a pinch. Dragapult can be a solid partner, serving as a check to Urshifu-R and putting pressure on Volcarona's defensive answers like Toxapex, Heatran, and Tyranitar, which are often tasked with being a team's Shadow Ball sponge, so that Volcarona can threaten to sweep if its shared checks with Dragapult get too low on HP. Spikes and Stealth Rock from lead Mew give Volcarona a path to break through even Heatran, with the entry hazard chip damage outpacing Leftovers recovery. Dragonite is yet another Dragon-type that pairs well with Volcarona, being a sweeper that fits excellently on the same offense and hyper offense teams that Volcarona does; Dragonite takes advantage of the special walls, most notably Heatran, that wall Volcarona, while Volcarona can take advantage of Dragonite's checks like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Clefable.</p>"

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Regenerator, a great Speed tier, and access to a wide variety of tools make Tornadus-T a versatile option that can fit on nearly any team. It can act as a supportive utility option with Defog and Knock Off, a specially defensive pivot with an Assault Vest set, or even a specially offensive threat thanks to Nasty Plot and some great coverage options, all while being one of the tier's best checks to the ever-present Rillaboom and Kartana. Despite this versatility, however, Tornadus-T has its shortcomings, namely its weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting how much it can recover with Regenerator if opting to run a non-Heavy-Duty Boots set. This also makes it weak to the common Knock Off, and there are a myriad of threats like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Weavile that are able to threaten Tornadus-T and force it out, enabling them to make progress against Tornadus-T's team through pivoting, Knock Off, or Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tornadus-T can use Taunt in conjunction with its high Speed to shut down opposing setup sweepers, prevent entry hazards from being set, or stop defensive Pokemon from using status or recovery moves. Similarly, Toxic is an option to cripple opposing Pokemon and limit their effectiveness. Sludge Bomb can be used on more offensive sets to better hit Clefable and Tapu Koko. Superpower is an option to surprise specially defensive switch-ins like Heatran as well as Tyranitar while hitting more consistently than Focus Blast. Weather Ball can be used on hail and sand teams primarily to provide strong coverage against Zapdos while otherwise being a decent neutral attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Zapdos can all easily threaten Tornadus-T with an OHKO or 2HKO while easily taking hits from it. Arctozolt also outspeeds Tornadus-T in hail and OHKOes it with Bolt Beak. Most of these don't like switching into Knock Off and can be pivoted out of with U-turn, but Zapdos in particular can punish Tornadus-T with Static.</p> <p><strong>Weavile</strong>: Weavile in particular is threatening to Tornadus-T thanks to outspeeding it if running a Jolly nature and doing significant damage with Ice Shard if running Adamant, though it can't switch into Tornadus-T due to its weakness to U-turn and overall frailty.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Tornadus-T struggles to meaningfully damage most specially defensive Pokemon if not running Superpower, and Heatran and Melmetal are notable for taking very little from its attacks and doing significant amounts of damage back, though it can significantly reduce their longevity by removing their Leftovers with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Tornadus-T is weak to Stealth Rock, which makes Regenerator less effective and leads to it either relying on Heavy-Duty Boots or needing a teammate that can either remove entry hazards or absorb Knock Off.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>High Speed and Regenerator with Defog and U-turn make Tornadus-T one of the tier's best Defoggers, with positive matchups against entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T and the ability to do decent chunks of damage to threats like Tyranitar and Tapu Lele while pivoting away from them. Knock Off adds further utility, letting Tornadus-T remove Assault Vests, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Galarian Slowking, Clefable, and Zapdos to make them easier for teammates to break through as well as crippling common switch-ins like Blissey and Heatran by reducing their longevity, particularly Heatran, which Tornadus-T can use Defog on and pivot out against with U-turn after removing its Leftovers. Hurricane threatens Grass- and Fighting-types like Rillaboom and Urshifu-R, while Heat Wave can be used instead to better hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Kartana. 168 Speed EVs let Tornadus-T outspeed Kartana, Alolan Ninetales, and Adamant Weavile, and investing leftover EVs in Defense lets it survive Surging Strikes from Choice Band Urshifu-R at full health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus-T fits well on most teams thanks to its excellent role compression and longevity allowing it to provide support for its teammates in numerous ways. Because offensive foes generally fear Knock Off, Tornadus-T can pivot in offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Rillaboom when opposing Knock Off absorbers like Toxapex and Slowbro switch in. Tornadus-T pairs well with Ground-types like Gastrodon and Excadrill that can check threatening Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos and in turn benefit from its ability to switch into Grass-types like Rillaboom. Because it is weak to Stealth Rock, Tornadus-T appreciates teammates that can absorb Knock Off like Clefable and Toxapex so it can keep its Heavy-Duty Boots. It struggles against specially defensive walls like Blissey and Heatran, so it needs physically offensive partners like Urshifu-R and Garchomp that can break through them. Tornadus-T is still threatened by a number of physical Pokemon like Weavile and Tyranitar despite its defensive investment, and so it benefits from a more physically defensive partner like Melmetal, Buzzwole, or Ferrothorn that can handle them.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Tornadus-T is a potent attacker that takes advantage of its high Special Attack and excellent Speed to be a powerful wallbreaker or sweeper. Hurricane is Tornadus-T's strongest STAB move and hits neutral targets such as Clefable and Landorus-T for massive damage, especially after a boost. Focus Blast greatly threatens the likes of Tyranitar and Heatran, in addition to 2HKOing would-be checks like Blissey and Rotom-W at +2. Heat Wave quickly dispatches Ferrothorn and hits Corviknight for heavy damage. Alternatively, Weather Ball can be considered as an option on weather teams that allows Tornadus-T to OHKO the likes of Landorus-T with rain or hail up, as well as threatening Zapdos in hail, whereas Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to support its team throughout the game even if it isn't in a position to set up and sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Tornadus-T typically finds itself on balance and bulky offense teams because of its versatility and wallbreaking prowess, as well as teams that appreciate its ability to check Grass-types like Rillaboom. Tornadus-T enjoys pairing up with other wallbreakers such as Kartana and Melmetal, allowing them to overwhelm their shared checks such as Zapdos. Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T are also much-appreciated teammates for Tornadus-T, as they provide it with safe switch-ins to Rock- and Electric-types like Tyranitar and Tapu Koko. In return, Tornadus-T can act as a check to Buzzwole, which is otherwise capable of overwhelming Garchomp and Landorus-T. Ferrothorn is another fantastic teammate, as it provides Tornadus-T with a safe switch-in to Tapu Koko, can lay down entry hazards that steadily chip at defensive switch-ins such as specially defensive Toxapex and can provide Knock Off support to cripple the likes of Zapdos on the switch. Tornadus-T also appreciates partnering with Heatran, as it can remove special walls like Blissey, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking that would otherwise impede Tornadus-T's progress, while Tornadus-T provides Heatran with a check to Ground- and Fighting-types such as Landorus-T and Urshifu-R.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With an Assault Vest, Tornadus-T turns into one of the better specially defensive pivots in the metagame, tanking hits from threats like Dragapult and Tapu Lele before pivoting out to bring in a teammate safely. Knock Off removes a plethora of items: for example, it can remove Choice Specs from special threats like Tapu Lele and Dragapult, which greatly hampers their ability to wallbreak without the power boost. U-turn generates momentum while hitting Pokemon that threaten Tornadus-T like Tyranitar and Weavile super effectively. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to hit Steel-types such as Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal super effectively, while Icy Wind is an option to hit offensive Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp if Tornadus-T is required to check them often on certain team structures. 252 HP and 88 Defense EVs allow Tornadus-T to survive Surging Strikes from Choice Band Urshifu-R at full health, while 168 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let it outspeed Adamant Weavile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Assault Vest Tornadus-T is appreciated on bulky offense teams wanting a defensive pivot that can cover the majority of special threats while also helping out against physical attackers like Kartana and Rillaboom. As Assault Vest Tornadus-T does not have the luxury of Heavy-Duty Boots preventing it from taking Stealth Rock damage, entry hazard removers like Defog Landorus-T and Tapu Fini are sorely needed. Landorus-T deserves a special mention, as it can take on Electric-types such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko. Sand Rush Excadrill is another Ground-type that can remove hazards with Rapid Spin on sand teams, making it a good partner on those structures. Frail offensive Pokemon like Blacephalon and Weavile are good teammates Tornadus-T, as they appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to sponge strong special attacks from the likes of Dragapult and Tapu Lele before bringing them in safely to wallbreak or set up. Bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Slowbro love Tornadus-T shielding them from Grass-type attackers like Kartana and Rillaboom, and it can also cover Choice Specs Dragapult for Slowbro in a pinch with its boosted special bulk. Steel-types make for great teammates: Ferrothorn is a sturdy stopgap against Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Weavile; Melmetal helps Tornadus-T check threats like Tapu Lele while also helping out against Weavile and Tyranitar; and specially defensive Heatran can stave off Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Blacephalon, while physically defensive Heatran helps against Weavile and Melmetal.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T has a claim for being the best Pokemon in SS OU. It is the quintessential \"glue\" Pokemon, and everything it provides, from its strong Earthquake to its utility to its immunities, is a trait that OU teams want. Intimidate and its natural bulk lets Landorus-T handle physical attackers like Garchomp and Blaziken, and with investment, it deals with special attackers like Tapu Koko and Heatran just as well. Landorus-T also can dominate the entry hazard game, as it can both set Stealth Rock and blow hazards away with Defog, notably being one of the few Pokemon to be able to do so on Heatran. Its typing lets it absorb Electric- and Ground-type attacks, which are both quite common in SS OU. Access to great utility moves like Knock Off, Toxic, and U-turn completes the Landorus-T package as one of the best defensive options in the metagame. Furthermore, Landorus-T can run a myriad of tech options like Explosion and alternate sets like Swords Dance to suit whatever a team may need. The only downsides to Landorus-T are that Weavile and Urshifu-R, the two best physical attackers in the metagame, can force it out and that it is prone to getting worn down by repeatedly switching into Stealth Rock and taking Toxic. However, don't get it twisted; Landorus-T is a metagame centralizer and a Pokemon you should always consider when teambuilding.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Landorus-T may use a Choice Scarf or Choice Band alongside Earthquake, U-turn, Knock Off, and Stone Edge to score surprise KOs against Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Clefable, but these sets are generally inconsistent. Hyper offense teams may opt to run a Focus Sash with Explosion + Stealth Rock as a lead to ensure that Stealth Rock gets up and stays up, but understand that Weavile and Urshifu-R can bypass Focus Sash with their super effective multi-hit moves. Swords Dance sets, but sometimes defensive sets as well, may opt for Soft Sand for additional power on Earthquake. Smack Down is an option that prevents Corviknight and Zapdos from staying in on Landorus-T. Rocky Helmet is an option on its defensive set to punish U-turn from opposing Landorus-T, but this denies Landorus-T any chance of recovery, making it much easier to wear down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Landorus-T's double weakness to Ice allows Ice-type Pokemon like Weavile and Arctozolt to force it out. Ice-type coverage from Pokemon like Dragonite and Buzzwole also heavily pressures Landorus-T, forcing a switch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types like Slowbro and Rotom-W can switch into Landorus-T's Earthquake and pressure it with a super effective STAB Water-type attack. Offensive Water-types like Barraskewda and Urshifu-R force Landorus-T out and can keep momentum up with their pivoting moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Particularly strong attackers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Choice Specs Tapu Lele can break through Landorus-T. Weaker ones like Dragapult and offensive Zapdos can quickly wear it down throughout a game as well.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth easily come in on Landorus-T's Earthquake and Knock Off and pressure it with their own Knock Off; Ferrothorn can even switch into Landorus-T's Toxic. Rillaboom can deal heavy damage to Landorus-T with Grassy Glide or Wood Hammer, and its Grassy Terrain weakens Landorus-T's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory</strong>: Corviknight and Skarmory are Landorus-T's best answers. Both are immune to Toxic and Earthquake, and neither care about taking Knock Off. Corviknight ensures that Landorus-T's Stealth Rock never stays on the field, and Skarmory can set Spikes against it freely. They can even run Rocky Helmet to chip away at Landorus-T when it uses U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Status</strong>: Because Landorus-T is reliant on Leftovers for recovery, Pokemon like Clefable and Tornadus-T can pressure it with Knock Off. Similarly, burn from Pokemon like Toxapex and Toxic from Pokemon like Garchomp can put Landorus-T on a timer, as it is often needed to come in repeatedly throughout a game, racking up residual damage.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Specially defensive Landorus-T has it all: a great typing, Intimidate, excellent bulk, a strong STAB move, and all the utility moves it could ever need. It is the premier defensive pivot in the metagame. Toxic punishes defensive and offensive foes alike, such as opposing Landorus-T and Zapdos, which may seek to switch into Landorus-T's Earthquake. Alternatively, Knock Off gives Landorus-T a way to make permanent progress against switch-ins like Corviknight and Skarmory while still crippling other Pokemon that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Landorus-T can run either Defog or Stealth Rock; being able to use Defog against Heatran makes it one of the best Defoggers in the tier. 16 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar. The rest of the investment is placed in Special Defense and HP to maximize Landorus-T's ability to check the tier's many special attackers such as Dragapult and Zapdos. Alternatively, 0 Speed investment with a negative nature and only 23 Speed IVs let Landorus-T be as slow as possible for a slow U-turn while still outspeeding Adamant Crawdaunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Landorus-T offers immense defensive role compression; accordingly, it can be found on a variety of team archetypes. Because Landorus-T is reliant on Leftovers for recovery, Knock Off absorbers like Clefable and Ferrothorn make for good partners. These Pokemon along with other options like Buzzwole and Toxapex also help check Weavile, Landorus-T's number one offensive check. Landorus-T often baits in physical walls like Corviknight and Ferrothorn, making wallbreakers like Dragapult and Heatran great recipients of its U-turn. Its slow U-turn is also very helpful for getting frail Pokemon like Kartana and Tapu Lele onto the field; they also appreciate Landorus-T keeping entry hazards off the field. Other defensive pivots like Corviknight and Slowbro take some of the onus off of Landorus-T to check so many things at once; they also help deal with Melmetal, which is capable of powering through Landorus-T's uninvested Defense. Slowbro additionally checks Urshifu-R, a huge offensive threat to Landorus-T. Late-game sweepers like Weavile and Dragonite take great advantage of Landorus-T crippling shared checks like Tapu Fini and Zapdos with Toxic and Knock Off. Finally, pairing Landorus-T with other specially bulky Pokemon like Slowking and Heatran helps make up for its lack of recovery and weakness to exceptionally strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Landorus-T uses its high Attack stat and great coverage to become one of the most devastating wallbreakers in the tier. Earthquake is Landorus-T's strongest STAB move, which can notably 2HKO physically bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Clefable after a Swords Dance boost. Stone Edge complements Earthquake nicely, as it allows Landorus-T to hit Flying-type Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Dragonite super effectively while having great neutral coverage against Pokemon like Corviknight and Buzzwole. Knock Off lets Landorus-T remove items like Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Rocky Helmet from defensive Pokemon that it can struggle to break through like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Corviknight, helping it and its teammates pressure them more easily while also having reliable netural coverage against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Rillaboom. A Jolly nature is used to allow Landorus-T to maximize its Speed, letting it outspeed Timid Nidoking and Jolly Excadrill. However, an Adamant nature can be used to allow Landorus-T to hit as hard as possible, giving it a good chance to OHKO Clefable and Slowbro with Earthquake and Knock Off after a Swords Dance boost, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Landorus-T fits well on various offensive teams as a strong wallbreaker that is capable of breaking huge holes in defensive cores. Offensive teammates like Urshifu-R and Zapdos appreciate Landorus-T breaking through their checks, such as Toxapex for Urshifu-R and Heatran for Zapdos. In return, Urshifu-R can check Weavile for Landorus-T as well as pivot Landorus-T in on Zapdos and Toxapex, granting it setup opportunities on them. Zapdos can pressure Landorus-T's common checks such as Slowbro, Corviknight, and Buzzwole as well as check Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana. It also keeps up momentum with Volt Switch to give Landorus-T opportunities to switch in against Pokemon like Heatran and Tapu Koko. Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Blacephalon pair well with Landorus-T, as they can eliminate Corviknight, Buzzwole, and Skarmory for it while Landorus-T checks Pokemon like Tyranitar and opposing Heatran for both. Magnezone can also support Landorus-T, since it can trap and remove Corviknight and Skarmory, which allows Landorus-T to wallbreak much easier.</p>"

      "Explosive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Explosion Landorus-T is a sacrificial lead that can set up Stealth Rock early and dent the opponent's team thanks to Swords Dance and Explosion, backed up by its massive Attack stat, which helps it offensively threaten other common leads like Clefable, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T. After a Swords Dance boost, Explosion OKHOes physical walls like Buzzwole, Slowbro, and Clefable as well as common Landorus-T switch-ins like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Earthquake is both Landorus-T's best STAB move and a great way to hit Normal-resistant foes like Melmetal, Tyranitar, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake can 2HKO many walls that don't resist it, including Clefable and Ferrothorn. There are also plenty of common Pokemon that are naturally threatened by Earthquake like Heatran, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. As such, Landorus-T is a great wallbreaker that can provide more to a team than just setting Stealth Rock and using Explosion. Intimidate is not only good for letting it set up Stealth Rock or Swords Dance more easily but can also potentially provide teammates with setup opportunities of their own after Landorus-T faints or uses Explosion. Landorus-T's decent bulk lets it survive strong attacks and get under a quarter of its HP frequently, letting it make great use of Custap Berry to use Explosion or throw off an Earthquake against faster foes before it faints. Some common moves from faster Pokemon that can bring Landorus-T into Custap Berry range are Clear Body Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Choice Scarf Blacephalon's Fire Blast. Alternatively, Landorus-T can make use of Normal Gem to boost Explosion's damage, allowing it to OHKO defensive pivots such as utility Tornadus-T without a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Explosion Landorus-T fits best on hyper offense teams. Its best partners are offensive teammates that like Stealth Rock to wear down their checks and appreciate the openings that Landorus-T forces with Explosion. Swords Dance Garchomp, Dragon Dance Dragapult, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Choice Band Kartana are offensive teammates that can take advantage of Stealth Rock wearing down their switch-ins and Explosion removing defensive walls. Water-types, like Urshifu-R and Tapu Fini, can switch into the Water- and Ice-type attacks that can KO Landorus-T before it can use Explosion or set up Stealth Rock. Similarly, a Weavile check like Buzzwole, Melmetal, or physically defensive Heatran is useful because Landorus-T struggles greatly against Weavile. Due to Landorus-T's lack of longevity, teams utilizing it as their only Stealth Rock user are vulnerable to having Stealth Rock removed. Defiant users like Bisharp and Galarian Zapdos can punish teams looking to remove Landorus-T's Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hawlucha stands as a good late-game cleaner on hyper offense or dual screens teams thanks to the combination of Swords Dance, Unburden, and its powerful STAB combination. When Unburden is activated, Hawlucha turns into a fearsome cleaner because of its unparalleled Speed tier, which allows it to outpace all Pokemon in the metagame and makes it hard to revenge kill without priority. However, Hawlucha is frail, even with the Defense boost provided by its Terrain Seed, so it can only set up on Pokemon that it can force out or take a hit from, like Kartana. It also has problems with breaking through some common walls like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Skarmory, even after a Swords Dance boost, and it can get heavily crippled by status or chip damage. Lastly, Hawlucha heavily relies on its teammates and their survival to accomplish its role, meaning it will be dead weight until late-game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is a possible option over Stone Edge or Taunt to avoid status effects like burn and poison from walls like Toxapex and Hippowdon; this also allows Hawlucha to tank some weak attacks and gives it more setup opportunities. However, Hawlucha hates losing these moves, as it has a bigger pool of checks and counters without them, like Zapdos and Skarmory.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls, such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Zapdos, can take all of Hawlucha's attacks and retaliate back. Toxapex can reset its boosts with Haze and burn or poison it, Slowbro can eliminate it with Future Sight and Scald, Skarmory can win one-on-one, and Zapdos can paralyze it with Static and OHKO with its STAB moves, only fearing a boosted Stone Edge. Aegislash deserves a special mention, since it resists all Hawlucha's attacks and can decimate it with its own.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All status ailments can severely cripple Hawlucha, as they can halve its Attack or Speed, slowly chip it down, or shut it down completely. Some of its checks, like Slowbro and Toxapex, can also cripple it with Scald burns or poison, hindering its ability to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Terrain</strong>: As Hawlucha relies on Terrains to start its sweep, Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom are roadblocks to it, as they can force Hawlucha out after switching in. Tapu Koko can also tank all of Hawlucha's attacks, even if it's boosted, while Tapu Fini can only stomach one attack and fire back.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance turns Hawlucha into a fearsome cleaner when combined with the Speed boost provided by Unburden. Stone Edge allows it to break through Zapdos and Tornadus-T, which otherwise could wall it; however, Taunt allows it to defeat certain walls, like Toxapex, Quagsire, and Hippowdon, by disabling their recovery moves at the cost of losing against the aforementioned Flying-types. Hawlucha's item is interchangeable depending on its teammates; on hyper offense teams, Hawlucha should run Grassy Seed, while on dual screens teams Electric Seed should be the choice. The Defense boost also allows it to set up more freely against threats like Kartana and Garchomp. The given EV spread allows Hawlucha to outspeed Excadrill in sand after Unburden activates, as well as revenge killing threats like +1 Volcarona if needed. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to increase chances to survive Clefable's Moonblast after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hawlucha should always be used in tandem with Tapu Koko or Rillaboom, as their abilities activate its item and therefore Unburden. Rillaboom provides a strong wallbreaker that shares checks with Hawlucha, like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, so they can overwhelm them together. However, Tapu Koko acts as an offensive pivot that can set up screens and deal with walls like Toxapex and Slowbro, as well as bringing in Hawlucha against would-be setup fodders like Ferrothorn with U-turn. As Hawlucha only has one opportunity to clean, it appreciates having all of its checks removed or chipped into KO range; this makes Knock Off support from Kartana and Weavile very valuable, as they can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from its checks like Toxapex and Zapdos. Both Kartana and Weavile also share checks with Hawlucha; this allows them to wear them down together and let one clean late-game. They can also pressure some of Hawlucha's checks, like Slowbro and Hippowdon, with their STAB moves. Finally, Dragapult and Hawlucha can form an offensive core that can be hard to manage. Dragapult pressures key targets like Zapdos or Toxapex and forces damage on them with its powerful STAB moves; it can also offer setup opportunities with U-turn, as it gets forced out by Pokemon that Hawlucha wants to use as setup fodder, like Blissey and Tyranitar.</p>"

Steam Eruption makes any physical attacker petrified of switching in on it, as they don't want to be inflicted with a burn; it can also burn Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, which are immune to poison damage. Volcanion's decent coverage in Earth Power and Sludge Wave helps it fix its problems, hitting would-be switch-ins like Toxapex and Tapu Fini, respectively.

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its high Special Attack, solid coverage in Earth Power and Sludge Wave, and access to the powerful Steam Eruption, Volcanion functions as a hard-hitting wallbreaker that is difficult to switch into. Steam Eruption, in addition to being a STAB move, has a decent chance of inflicting burn, threatening would-be switch-ins like Dragonite and Dragapult. Earth Power hits Pokemon like Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and opposing Volcanion. Sludge Wave hits Tapu Fini and Clefable and should always be the fourth move on Choice Specs sets. For Heavy-Duty Boots sets, Toxic wears down common switch-ins like Dragonite, Gastrodon, and Slowbro, while Substitute alternatively lets Volcanion take advantage of Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Heatran when they switch out. Choice Specs lets Volcanion unload massive damage, giving it a chance to OHKO Tornadus-T and offensive Garchomp; however, Heavy-Duty Boots is a solid alternative, as Stealth Rock is a major weakness for Volcanion. A Modest nature lets Volcanion deal more damage, giving it a much higher chance to OHKO offensive Garchomp and Clefable, whereas a Timid nature lets it outspeed Pokemon like Magnezone and Adamant Choice Band Buzzwole while providing Volcanion a chance to outspeed opposing Volcanion. Water Absorb, while being the only ability Volcanion can choose, is solid, since it lets Volcanion switch in on Barraskewda and Urshifu-R Choice-locked into a Water-type move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volcanion functions best on offense and balance teams. Weavile is a great partner, as it threatens Pokemon like Dragonite and Dragapult; in return, Volcanion takes care of Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Melmetal. Landorus-T is another good teammate, since it can set Stealth Rock or provide Defog support, which greatly helps Volcanion due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Landorus-T can also pivot it in thanks to U-turn. Zapdos is another option for a potential Defogger, threatens Water-types, and can bring Volcanion in safely with Volt Switch; in return, Volcanion threatens Heatran and Ferrothorn. Tornadus-T is another potential Defogger that can also spread Knock Off and bring Volcanion in with U-turn. Volcanion can support Tornadus-T by threatening Heatran and Melmetal, two Pokemon that it can't do much against. Kartana is a great offensive partner that can threaten some of Volcanion's best checks, namely Gastrodon, Slowbro, and Rotom-W; Volcanion can take care of Landorus-T and Ferrothorn in return. Ferrothorn provides some entry hazard support in Spikes, which are quite helpful for Volcanion, as it just barely misses out on OHKOing Garchomp without any hazards set up.</p>"

  "Toxapex": {
    "overview": "<p>In spite of all that has been developed to counteract its presence, Toxapex still endures as an easy-to-fit metagame staple in SS OU. Blessed with absurd defenses and Regenerator, Toxapex can soft check just about anything and threatens item removal with Knock Off, status in Toxic and Scald, and the removal of stat boosts with Haze. This titanic bulk also means that Toxapex can pivot into an extensive amount of Pokemon and scout them, easing prediction against threats like Blaziken, Choice Specs Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Choice Band Tyranitar. As the metagame has developed, countermeasures have been mounted against the living bunker: Future Sight from the likes of Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Lele paired with strong attackers is a common tactic to try and break through Toxapex. However, much like the animal it takes its inspiration from, it adapts to the environment around it, most notably reinventing itself as a Light Screen pivot to halve damage from Future Sight, allowing it to effectively wall Future Sight chains by staying in and healing just before the attack hits. However, compared to other Regenerator users, Toxapex suffers from a severe case of four-moveslot syndrome that can make it very passive, often finding itself treated as set up fodder by the likes of Swords Dance Kartana, Calm Mind Clefable, and Substitute Volcarona, as it struggles to fit Scald and Haze together in the modern metagame. Additionally, its typing is both a blessing and a curse; while checking or flat out countering physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Blaziken is a large boon, it is prone to being overwhelmed by the attackers it is supposed to check by virtue of the common Future Sight support these wallbreakers often are paired with. This passivity also means most Toxapex sets are free entry points for strong offensive Ground-types like Excadrill and Garchomp. The choice of what Toxapex has to run on a given team is quite the conundrum, and every moveset Toxapex runs has some hole it can't effectively cover without the help of its teammates.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Baneful Bunker can appear to be an enticing way for Toxapex to punish contact moves such as U-turn and Knock Off and scout coverage moves, but this is often redundant, as Toxapex is already a dedicated physical sponge, so it should only really be considered on teams weak to some specific wallbreakers with contact moves like Victini and Rillaboom. A rare albeit potent item Toxapex can choose to run is Payapa Berry, allowing it to survive a STAB Psychic or Psyshock from Tapu Lele and remove its item with Knock Off or status it with Toxic. Toxapex can run Block + Spite with Knock Off and Recover, which allows it to trap and PP stall common switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Clefable while still being able to pivot in and remove items effectively. Finally, Toxapex can choose to run Toxic Spikes, which will critically forces status on grounded targets such as Tapu Fini, Garchomp, Arctozolt, and Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: If there's one continuous fact that will always plague Toxapex's viability in the tier, it is the prevalence of Future Sight paired with breakers. In spite of Toxapex often being a dedicated utility piece that can set Light Screen, it is prone to being overwhelmed by the likes of Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, and Slowbro using Future Sight and pivoting to the physical or special attackers they enable. Even Pokemon that Toxapex has a beneficial type matchup against such as Blaziken and Urshifu-R will have good odds of breaking through it once it has to come in and check them if there's a Future Sight ready.</p> <p><strong>Magma Storm Heatran</strong>: Heatran is synonymous with ruining Toxapex that can't afford to run Shed Shell, seeing as Magma Storm + Earth Power will trap and KO Toxapex with little to no effort. However, this matchup changes if Toxapex chooses to run Shed Shell, as it can come in and soft check Heatran, while Heatran has to respect Knock Off removing its Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Strong Choice Item Attackers</strong>: Some threats can circumvent Toxapex's incredible bulk with their own immense attacks. Choice Band Tyranitar can threaten to 2HKO Toxapex with both of its STAB moves, but it is uncomfortable switching directly into Toxapex, as it has to contend with Toxapex using Scald or Toxic to cripple it or put it on a timer. Similar to Tyranitar, Choice Band Grass-types such as Kartana and Rillaboom can quickly overwhelm Toxapex with their strong STAB moves, but they too have to respect Toxapex using moves such as Scald and Knock Off to neuter their ability to threaten it. The rare Galarian Zapdos can pull similar stunts, with its Brave Bird threatening a clean 2HKO on Toxapex. Choice Specs Blacephalon's Shadow Ball will cleanly 2HKO Toxapex, as will Choice Specs Volcanion's Earth Power. In the case of Blacephalon, it can also use Trick on Toxapex on the switch in, crippling it for the remainder of the game. These Pokemon have to respect Toxapex's utility options, as both hate having their Choice Specs removed with Knock Off and struggle to break through Toxapex should it set Light Screen. Trick Pokemon such as Blacephalon have to ensure that the Toxapex isn't using Black Sludge, which will cripple the Trick user much like Trick hampers Toxapex.</p> <p><strong>Choice Specs Tapu Lele</strong>: No special attacker without setup hits Toxapex as hard as Choice Specs Tapu Lele. Its Psychic will OHKO Toxapex, and given that Toxapex is one of the best leads in the tier, it often does this in the beginning of the game, and there is very little Toxapex can do about it. An option some Toxapex choose to run to match Tapu Lele is Payapa Berry, allowing Toxapex to survive one Psychic or Psyshock and remove Tapu Lele's Choice Specs with Knock Off or status it with Toxic. However, using Knock Off comes with the caveat that Toxapex has just given a Tapu Lele the choice in picking whatever move it wants for the rest of the game, and using Toxic means that Tapu Lele will still be a formidable wallbreaker in spite of it being put on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Arctozolt</strong>: Arctozolt is one of few physical attackers that will often bust straight through Toxapex with its Bolt Beak, and given how Arctozolt will always be paired with hail and Stealth Rock, it will just about always force a KO, should the Toxapex be forced to stay in. Arctozolt does, however, have to respect Toxapex having the ability to set Toxic Spikes, giving it less room to come in and attack it, or run Baneful Bunker to punish Bolt Beak. Moves such as Baneful Bunker are rare, however, and should Toxapex reveal it early, Arctozolt will quite readily be able to play around it. Arctozolt can also circumvent these mind games by running Substitute + Freeze-Dry to scout Toxapex attempting to stay in, and Freeze-Dry is also a good option that can catch the Ground-types that Toxapex is often paired with.</p> <p><strong>Strong Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Tapu Koko are immensely threatening to Toxapex, scaring it out with their strong STAB Thunderbolts, and can use Toxapex to create momentum with Volt Switch. However, both of them hate getting statused by Toxic and have to play with that in mind before switching in.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus-T are incredibly threatening for Toxapex, as its only real way to manage them is to attempt to burn them with Scald or use Toxic before they begin setting up or threaten to 2HKO it with their STAB moves.</p>",

      "The Pex": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Toxapex has an extensive movepool and a lot of different choices it can pick and choose from. Light Screen is excellent support for both itself and its teammates, halving the damage from the ubiquitous Future Sight and allowing Toxapex to come in on special attackers such as Volcanion and Blacephalon effectively. Knock Off is a fantastic move that allows Toxapex's teammates some much needed reprieve by removing items from the likes of Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Landorus-T. Scald is Toxapex's best immediate damaging option, chipping away at the health of Water-weak Pokemon, and can critically punish switches with burns, potentially crippling physical attackers like Rillaboom and Garchomp while also ensuring Ferrothorn and Corviknight can't come in on Toxapex risk-free. Poison Jab is necessary on some structures to ensure that Toxapex isn't setup fodder for Calm Mind Tapu Fini. Toxic is an enticing move for Toxapex, as it will put common pivots like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T on a timer and has inherent synergy with Knock Off, which allows Toxapex to either remove items from Pokemon that are Toxic-immune or put problematic Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Volcarona on a timer. Haze is an alternative that lets Toxapex remove boosts and PP stall setup sweepers like Volcarona. The only mandatory move Toxapex has is Recover; it is reliant on the move to stay healthy in longer matches. The choice of nature will mostly depend on what moves Toxapex is running; Impish means Knock Off and Poison Jab will hit a bit harder, Bold means that Scald will deal a bit more damage, and a Relaxed nature will mean Toxapex isn't picking and choosing between natures that hamper its attacking stats and can allow it to scout Pokemon that are otherwise slower than it like Slowbro and Slowking. The item Toxapex chooses is extremely important, as every single one has different advantages. Shed Shell means that Toxapex won't be trapped by Magma Storm Heatran and allows it to cripple Heatran's longevity with Knock Off or wear it down with Scald before switching out. Rocky Helmet will deal significant damage to attackers like Urshifu-R and Weavile that are reliant on contact moves and can punish pivoting moves like U-turn with heavy chip damage. Finally, Black Sludge gives Toxapex even more longevity and allows it to punish Trick users like Blacephalon and Tapu Fini.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxapex fits on an extensive number of teams and forms synergistic defensive cores with a large amount of Pokemon. Tornadus-T pairs well with Toxapex, forming a potent Regenerator core that can check Kartana, Rillaboom, and Ferrothorn, all of which Toxapex can otherwise struggle to do anything noteworthy to without Scald. Toxapex will, in return, check strong wallbreakers like Blaziken and Weavile that can threaten to break through Tornadus-T. Corviknight and Zapdos similarly pair well with Toxapex, and all three Flying-types provide consistent entry hazard removal with Defog, which Toxapex appreciates. The aforementioned Flying-types also check bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, which Toxapex can't realistically manage on its own. Clefable is another utility piece that works well with Toxapex and can allow Toxapex to keep its item, since Clefable is a good Knock Off absorber. Toxapex synergizes incredibly well with bulky Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, since they scare out and check some of Toxapex's worst matchups like Tapu Koko, Magma Storm Heatran, and Zapdos. A final teammate to consider is Blissey, as it checks Pokemon that Toxapex can't realistically manage on its own such as Choice Specs Volcanion, Blacephalon, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to turn Toxapex into a strong special wall that can check a large swath of special attackers such as Volcanion, Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Volcarona while still being able to handle physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Weavile with its incredible defensive typing and good physical bulk even without investment. Knock Off lets Toxapex hamper wallbreakers like Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Band Urshifu-R while also removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the likes of Zapdos and Landorus-T. Toxic puts switch-ins like Slowbro and Tornadus-T on a timer. The burn chance from Scald is noteworthy, as Toxapex will have a lot of opportunities to come in and fire off the move, giving it chances to burn switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn. Poison Jab gives Toxapex the ability to beat Calm Mind Tapu Fini. Haze and Recover ensure that Toxapex can keep up its walling capabilities, as without Haze, it will critically fail to check setup sweepers like Substitute + Quiver Dance Volcarona effectively. Should your team have appropriate counterplay versus these setup sweepers, Light Screen can be considered to support the team with counterplay against Future Sight while also easing prediction against special attackers like Zapdos and Tapu Lele. The given special bulk investment ensures that Toxapex can shrug off special hits from the likes of Dragapult and Volcanion effectively. 20 Defense EVs let Toxapex survive unboosted Modest Tapu Lele's Psyshock at full health, allowing Toxapex to either poison it with Toxic or remove its item with Knock Off. Shed Shell enables Toxapex to avoid being trapped by Heatran's Magma storm and irritate it with STAB Scald or Knock Off before switching out, while Black Sludge can allow Toxapex to effectively disrupt Trick users like Blacephalon and gives Toxapex even more longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seeing as this Toxapex set is not a catch-all for physical attackers, you will need to account for this when picking teammates. Physically defensive Corviknight is a standard pairing with specially defensive Toxapex, as it can check threats like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, Kartana, and Melmetal while also clearing away entry hazards with Defog. Zapdos can fill a similar role to the aforementioned Corviknight while also acting as a good special attacker, which makes up for Toxapex's passivity. Tornadus-T is another option that can allow Toxapex to drop Knock Off for Toxic, as Tornadus-T is incredibly efficient at removing items. It can also set up with Nasty Plot and KO Pokemon like Heatran which would otherwise check Toxapex. Clefable is a good partner to Toxapex, as it can check threats like Garchomp and Weavile while having the ability to set Stealth Rock effectively, remove items with Knock Off, or be an Unaware tank that can effectively match them. Buzzwole is a physical tank that can check Weavile and Kartana, as well as key threats like Choice Band Tyranitar, which specially defensive Toxapex cannot effectively handle. Offensive Steel-types like Melmetal also help out Toxapex by a fair amount, as Toxapex is deathly afraid of staring down Tapu Lele, which Melmetal can handily scare out. Toxapex has good type synergy with bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp that can threaten its checks like Magma Storm Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Electric-types like Tapu Koko with their strong STAB Earthquakes.</p>"

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Koko is one of the best pivots in the tier, owing to its lightning-fast Speed, ability to generate momentum like none other with access to both Volt Switch and U-turn, and its sizable offensive presence that forces switches from common metagame threats like Tornadus-T and Weavile. It can threaten the tier's defensive Water-types and Flying-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Corviknight with ease and can even make good use of its resistances to Flying, Fighting, and Dark, keeping healthy with Roost and defensively checking the likes of Tornadus-T and Zapdos. It has the option to set up with Calm Mind, with its incredible Speed stat giving it an edge against offensive teams and making it challenging to revenge kill. Despite all of this, however, Tapu Koko's lackluster defensive stats and mediocre base Special Attack stat cannot be ignored, and faster Pokemon like Timid Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Scarf Kartana are able to force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Koko can specialize as a support Pokemon and run a dual screens set with Light Clay for hyper offense teams, utilizing its great Speed and access to Taunt, with the additional option of setting up Electric Seed Hawlucha. Tapu Koko can use Nature's Madness to chip its checks incredibly efficiently, which is its best way to make progress against Ferrothorn. However, this move is hard to fit, as running Nature's Madness usually necessitates dropping Dazzling Gleam, meaning that Tapu Koko loses its best way to hit Modest Dragapult.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Rillaboom resists Tapu Koko's Electric-type attacks, cancels out its Electric Terrain upon switch in, and threatens out Tapu Koko with its incredibly strong Grass-type attacks. Ferrothorn resists Tapu Koko's STAB combination and uses Leech Seed to whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Excadrill, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Garchomp can block Volt Switch and threaten force out Tapu Koko with super effective Ground-type attacks, but Tapu Koko can bypass their immunity by using U-turn, and Garchomp must be wary of switching into Dazzling Gleam. With the exception of Excadrill, Tapu Koko can also use Toxic to cripple these Pokemon as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Dragapult and Zeraora, and Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Tapu Lele can outspeed and force out Tapu Koko if they are able to get a safe switch in.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon like specially defensive Heatran and Blissey can shrug off Tapu Koko's special attacks, though neither of them appreciate being chipped by a pivot move as Tapu Koko makes its way out.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Tapu Koko makes great use of its incredible Speed to offensively check the likes of Weavile and Modest Dragapult with its STAB Dazzling Gleam and defensively check and outspeed Tornadus-T and Zapdos with its chosen Electric-type STAB move. Dazzling Gleam also allows Tapu Koko to hit Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as other Electric-resistant targets like Rillaboom. U-turn is used to build momentum and capitalize on the switches that it can force due to its attacking power and Speed, and Toxic can be used on Volt Switch variants to put Electric-immune Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gastrodon, and Zeraora on a timer. The trade-off of dropping Thunderbolt for Volt Switch is that Tapu Koko can no longer reliably pressure Slowking and specially defensive Toxapex; however, Volt Switch can take a chunk out of Heatran as Tapu Koko pivots out, and it opens up a moveslot to run the aforementioned Toxic. Tapu Koko can rely on Roost to heal off chip damage and act as a consistent defensive check to Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Heavy-Duty Boots are a crucial part of Tapu Koko's role as a pivot, ignoring any entry hazards that would otherwise eat away at Tapu Koko's health as it pivots throughout the game. Threats like Jolly Weavile and Modest Dragapult that sit above Tapu Koko's neutral-natured Speed tier necessitate that it always runs a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams ranging from offensive to balanced very much appreciate Tapu Koko's momentum-grabbing and revenge killing capabilities. Tapu Koko loves the presence of Stealth Rock and especially Spikes to dig into checks like Ferrothorn and Gastrodon as it pivots out, so entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn can enable Tapu Koko to be much more of a menace. Building off of the last point, Knock Off users like Weavile, Ferrothorn, and Clefable can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Blissey and open them up to hazard damage. Slow pivots like Slowbro and Landorus-T are ideal partners for working in tandem with Tapu Koko to constantly grab momentum and bring Tapu Koko in safely. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Weavile, Choice Band Urshifu-R, and Victini are great recipients of Tapu Koko's pivoting support, as they can break through Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon as well as Ferrothorn. The last two can take advantage of Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain boosting Thunder Punch and Bolt Strike, respectively, allowing them to 2HKO Toxapex, and they can even work as part of a powerful pivoting core with Tapu Koko.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Using its wonderful Speed stat, Tapu Koko poses an immense threat with Calm Mind boosts, being able to clean up weakened teams late-game with its Terrain-boosted Thunderbolt. Dazzling Gleam allows Tapu Koko to cleave through the likes of Dragapult and Electric-immune Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Zeraora. Roost allows it to shrug off attacks from foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T while using them as setup fodder. Tapu Koko wields a Timid nature to outrun the likes of Weavile and Modest Dragapult, stopping them from revenge killing it while boosted. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore entry hazards, giving it even more setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tapu Koko fits well on balance and semi-stall teams that appreciate its high Speed and ability to both revenge kill and act as a wincon. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and more notably Spikes synergize incredibly with Tapu Koko, as they work away at checks like Galarian Slowking, Gastrodon, and opposing Ferrothorn, paving a way for Tapu Koko to clean up late-game; therefore, hazard setters like Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory are good partners. Ferrothorn is a notable hazard setter as it's able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Blissey with Knock Off, opening them up to hazard damage. Wallbreakers like Victini and Urshifu-R work well against Tapu Koko's checks like Ferrothorn, specially defensive Heatran, and Blissey, and the Terrain that Tapu Koko sets boosts Bolt Strike and Thunder Punch in return, helping Victini and Urshifu-R against the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex. Offensive Ground-types like Excadrill and Landorus-T, which can take a hit and threaten Tapu Koko in return, are extremely threatening, so defensive checks like Slowbro and Buzzwole make for great teammates.</p>"

  "Tapu Lele": {
    "overview": "<p>The combination of a monstrous Special Attack stat, a great offensive STAB combination, and a phenomenal ability makes Tapu Lele one of the most feared wallbreakers in OU. Psychic Surge makes Tapu Lele's Psychic-type STAB attacks deal mind-boggling damage with Choice Specs, 2HKOing bulky neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Tapu Fini, and Volcanion with its Psyshock, and helps it retain substantial power even on sets without Choice Specs, still OHKOing threats weak to its STAB moves like Buzzwole and 2HKOing neutral targets like Slowbro. Tapu Lele can play a late-game cleaner role with Choice Scarf or be an incredible wallbreaker with Choice Specs. Choice Scarf lets Tapu Lele also provide solid speed control, improving its otherwise average Speed. Calm Mind sets are another option for Tapu Lele that offers offer strong sweeping potential. Additionally, Psychic Terrain gives Tapu Lele extra utility by preventing priority moves from the likes of Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Scizor. This heavily benefits faster teammates and makes setting up easier for them. However, Tapu Lele's Speed often leaves a lot to be desired without a Choice Scarf, with it getting outsped and overwhelmed by common offensive threats such as Kartana, Garchomp, and Blacephalon. Even Choice Scarf variants can be outsped and overwhelmed by other Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Blacephalon. This issue becomes much more concerning when one considers Tapu Lele's middling bulk, leaving it prone to revenge killers like Weavile and Kartana. Tapu Lele also lacks a consistent way to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal due to Focus Blast's inaccuracy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On rain teams, Choice Specs Tapu Lele can use Thunder to take advantage of its perfect accuracy to punish Corviknight and Skarmory hard. Outside of rain teams, Tapu Lele can use Thunderbolt to hit these Pokemon, though Choice Scarf Tapu Lele fails to consistently 2HKO Corviknight. Aromatherapy can be used on Choice Scarf sets to revitalize statused teammates, like Weavile or Urshifu-R burned by Flame Body or paralyzed by Static, giving them a second wind and punishing opponents that trade chip damage on their Pokemon for status on Tapu Lele's key teammates. Rocky Helmet can be used on the Calm Mind set to punish contact moves like U-turn, specifically multi-hit moves like Triple Axel and Surging Strikes. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can drop Future Sight for a different move like Psychic or Thunderbolt if a teammate like Slowbro already has Future Sight.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Tapu Lele's STAB moves and are only threatened by the inconsistent Focus Blast, which often requires prediction that is made even more unfavorable by its shaky accuracy. Melmetal is a great example due to its excellent HP stat that, when paired with significant Special Defense investment, allows it to absorb Tapu Lele's STAB attacks and even take Focus Blast, threatening Tapu Lele back with an OHKO with Double Iron Bash. Other Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Aegislash can serve as solid checks or counters to Tapu Lele using their typing and bulk, with the last two not needing to worry about a super effective Focus Blast. However, with the exception of Jirachi, these Pokemon do not have reliable recovery and can be prone to getting chipped down over time. Corviknight can be used to check Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and scout out attacks from Choice Specs Tapu Lele, but it takes a significant amount from Choice Specs Focus Blast and can't handle Thunderbolt and Thunder variants.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster threats like Dragapult, Blacephalon, Kartana, Weavile, and Garchomp can force out Tapu Lele with ease if they are able to get in safely, and due to Tapu Lele's average Speed and poor physical bulk, there are many Pokemon within the metagame that fit this description. However, an unrevealed Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can flip the script for a surprise KO if proper caution isn't exercised by the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Victini is a superb Tapu Lele answer, resisting both of its STAB moves and Focus Blast and threatening it with V-create in return. Slowking can scout a Choice item Tapu Lele's move, resisting Tapu Lele's more spammable Psychic-type attacks and stomaching Moonblast and healing the damage off with Regenerator. However, Tapu Lele can use Shadow Ball to deal significant damage to these Pokemon, 2HKOing both.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Stall teams can accomplish the near-impossible feat of playing around Calm Mind and Choice Specs Tapu Lele once it is put on a timer with Toxic. Additionally, once paralyzed, Tapu Lele becomes much easier to play around with defensive checks like Corviknight, which can now use Roost first to shed its Flying typing against Tapu Lele packing Electric-type coverage, and Heatran and Ferrothorn, which appreciate the increased unlikeliness of Focus Blast hitting and that Heatran can outspeed and hit first.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Tapu Lele to bypass its middling Speed tier while still remaining very threatening due to its excellent STAB moves, useful coverage in Focus Blast, and great ability in Psychic Surge. Future Sight supports most physical attackers that Tapu Lele is paired with, notably overwhelming would-be defensive answers to Pokemon like Weavile and Urshifu-R, letting them 2HKO checks like Corviknight and Clefable with Triple Axel and Surging Strikes, respectively. Psyshock cuts through specially bulky Pokemon like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Gastrodon by taking advantage of their weaker Defense stat. Focus Blast allows Tapu Lele to deal significant damage to Steel-types like Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Heatran that would otherwise completely wall it. Psychic can be used over Focus Blast as an alternative cleaning option, since it has higher power than Psyshock and hits specially, giving Tapu Lele the option to hit physically defensive targets like utility Zapdos and Clefable; however, this gives Tapu Lele a harder time against bulky Steel-types like Ferrothorn. A Modest nature is preferred to give Tapu Lele an important power boost against targets like Blissey and specially defensive Heatran, having a favorable chance to 2HKO them with Psyshock and Focus Blast, respectively, but a Timid nature can be used to hit certain benchmarks like outspeeding +2 Adamant Blaziken and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on offense teams, providing them with solid Speed control and offensive support with Psychic Surge-boosted Future Sight. Weavile and Urshifu-R make for great partners as Future Sight can shut down their common switch-ins, but various other physical attackers like Melmetal, Kartana, Victini, and Rillaboom appreciate Future Sight hitting physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Toxapex, and Buzzwole. The benefits of Future Sight are not limited to physical attackers, however, as special attackers like Choice Specs Dragapult and Volcanion appreciate Future Sight assisting them in chipping down special walls like Gastrodon and Blissey. Fast sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance + Scale Shot Garchomp are emboldened by Psychic Terrain blocking priority moves like Weavile's Ice Shard. Offensive pivots like Dragapult and Urshifu-R can force switches in order to bring in Tapu Lele, and slow pivots like Slowbro and Landorus-T can take a hit first before using U-turn or Teleport to get Tapu Lele in safely, both of which are helpful due to its unimpressive bulk. Magnezone can forcibly remove Steel-type checks to Tapu Lele like Corviknight and Ferrothorn.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Equipped with Choice Specs, Tapu Lele becomes an absolutely monstrous wallbreaker capable of decimating defensive staples such as Clefable, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex. Psyshock lets (filler) it 2HKO special walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking while also doing more damage to specially defensive Heatran than Psychic. Moonblast complements Psyshock extremely well, targeting Dark-types such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Galarian Moltres while also hitting Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Psychic is a stronger STAB option that lets Tapu Lele deal more damage to the likes of Melmetal and Corviknight. Meanwhile, Focus Blast is Tapu Lele's best option against Steel-types, OHKOing Melmetal without Assault Vest and Ferrothorn and 2HKOing Heatran. Thunderbolt is Tapu Lele's strongest move against Corviknight, Slowbro, and Slowking, while Shadow Ball lets Tapu Lele hit Aegislash, Victini, Jirachi, and Shedinja. A Modest nature increases Tapu Lele's power, maximizing the odds for OHKOs on Ferrothorn and physically defensive Heatran with Focus Blast and Toxapex with Psyshock. It also allows Tapu Lele to OHKO offensive Zapdos with Psychic and 2HKO Corviknight with Focus Blast. However, a Timid nature lets Tapu Lele outspeed the likes of Timid Nidoking, Excadrill, and Timid Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Tapu Lele fits best on offensive teams thanks to its insane wallbreaking potential. Slow, bulky pivots such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, Slowbro, and Rotom-W make for excellent partners for Tapu Lele, each shielding its mediocre bulk from powerful attackers and ensuring that it can switch in safely on Pokemon such as Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Buzzwole. Faster-paced offensive pivots such as Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Urshifu-R also make for solid partners, as they can let Tapu Lele in by forcing switches into Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Slowbro that it can take advantage of. Urshifu-R in particular can lure in defensive Pokemon that are vulnerable to Tapu Lele such as Toxapex and Zapdos while also appreciating Tapu Lele luring in Heatran and Melmetal. Frail offensive Pokemon that are vulnerable to priority like Volcarona and Blacephalon heavily appreciate the protection given by Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain. Late-game sweepers such as Blacephalon, Weavile, and Volcarona appreciate Tapu Lele threatening Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Zapdos, letting them more easily apply pressure to weakened opposing teams. In return, these Pokemon are able to threaten Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar that could otherwise force Tapu Lele out. This also eases Choice Specs's prediction-reliant nature. Speed control from the likes of Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Choice Scarf Kartana is also appreciated, as they can help Tapu Lele deal with faster threats such as Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Tapu Koko.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind Tapu Lele is a devastating setup wallbreaker that terrorizes passive teams, as it can take advantage of forced switches to set up and muscle through checks like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Blissey. Psyshock takes advantage of special walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking. Focus Blast gives Tapu Lele excellent coverage, as it nails Steel-type checks that resist its STAB combination like Heatran, Melmetal, and Ferrothorn. Shadow Ball can also be run in this moveslot if Tapu Lele desires to obliterate rarer checks like Aegislash, Shedinja, Slowking, and Jirachi, but it makes Tapu Lele less effective against more standard Steel-type checks. Thunderbolt is another alternative that serves as a midground between the aforementioned moves by threatening defensive cores made up of Pokemon that resist Tapu Lele's STAB types, such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Removing Corviknight is particularly notable, as it resists Tapu Lele's STAB combination while being neutral to its other coverage moves. Twisted Spoon powers up Psyshock to outrageous levels, allowing it to 2HKO Blissey unboosted. A Timid nature ensures that Tapu Lele outruns threats like Swords Dance Landorus-T and Timid Nidoking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Calm Mind Tapu Lele is relatively frail and lacks Speed, it appreciates teammates that provide speed control and bring it onto the field safely. This makes Choice Scarf users like Urshifu-R and Kartana good offensive partners, as they outspeed threats like Choice Specs Dragapult and Blacephalon that force Tapu Lele out. Urshifu-R has the distinction of being able to pivot Tapu Lele in safely with U-turn, and Calm Mind Tapu Lele preys on the bulk of Urshifu-R's switch-ins, such as Toxapex and Buzzwole. Checks to the aforementioned Dragapult and Blacephalon are highly appreciated: Heatran is an exemplary teammate, as it has the bulk to take boosted Shadow Balls and retaliate with Earth Power or Toxic. It also appreciates Tapu Lele removing specially defensive walls that can stave it off like Gastrodon and Hippowdon and threatens the Steel-types that switch into Tapu Lele, such as Melmetal and Ferrothorn. Specially defensive Landorus-T is another Dragapult and Blacephalon check that sacrifices the ability to take hits comfortably for the utility of U-turn to bring Tapu Lele in safely. Heatran and Landorus-T also bear the distinction of being good Stealth Rock setters, wearing down switch-ins like opposing Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Corviknight into range of Tapu Lele's attacks. It is important to have checks to physical threats that naturally outspeed Tapu Lele: utility Tornadus-T can take on Kartana and Urshifu-R, while Rotom-W is a good stopgap to Weavile and Urshifu-R. Both Pokemon come with the bonus of providing safe entry for Tapu Lele with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Weavile has unique synergy with Tapu Lele, as it can offensively pressure Dragapult thanks to its typing and overload Steel-type checks like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Melmetal that are often tasked to deal with Tapu Lele as well.</p>"

  "Tapu Bulu": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Bulu separates itself from other offensive Grass-types thanks to its high Attack stat, Terrain-boosted Horn Leech, and strong coverage in Close Combat and Stone Edge to break past its would-be checks like Ferrothorn, Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz. Its strong defensive typing lets it check Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora. Grassy Terrain provides it with some form of longevity and mitigates Life Orb’s recoil; furthermore, many teammates appreciate the passive recovery and weakening of Earthquake. However, Tapu Bulu often struggles to compete with Rillaboom for a team slot, as it offers priority in Grassy Glide and can support its teammates with Knock Off and U-turn. Tapu Bulu's middling Speed tier also gives it issues when setting up against offensive teams and lets many faster threats force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Bulu can run Yache Berry so it can survive an Icicle Crash from Weavile and OHKO back, but its listed items are more useful. It can run a bulky set with maximum HP investment, some defensive investment, and a moveset of Swords Dance / Horn Leech / Close Combat / Synthesis, which allows for a sturdy offensive check to the likes Urshifu-R, Garchomp, Zeraora, and Tapu Koko.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Though Corviknight, Skarmory, and Tangrowth don't like directly switching into Tapu Bulu, they are good checks even when Tapu Bulu is boosted. Corviknight can pressure Tapu Bulu with Brave Bird, while Skarmory can phaze it with Whirlwind. Tangrowth can weaken it with Knock Off and chip it down with Rocky Helmet. However, they can easily be overloaded due to Tapu Bulu’s high Base Power coverage and boosted strength. Buzzwole is a big roadblock for Tapu Bulu, able to take any hits after a boost and force it out with Ice Punch or recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Tapu Bulu's Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile, which can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock and Spikes constantly chip down Tapu Bulu, and its lack of reliable recovery outside of bulky sets makes it get worn down easily. U-turn from Pokemon it otherwise beats such as Landorus-T and Urshifu-R can cause further chip damage, leaving it prone to being overwhelmed in trying to check them. Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs also wear it down.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's most effective STAB move, as its recovery offsets Life Orb recoil and is very strong under Grassy Terrain. Close Combat allows Tapu Bulu to hit Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge is great coverage to hit Pokemon that resist its other moves like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz. Life Orb guarantees OHKOs at +2 on Mandibuzz and defensive Dragonite when Multiscale is inactive. Leftovers is an alternative over Life Orb, as it stacks with Grassy Terrain for better longevity, though the reduced damage is very noticeable. Jolly is the preferred nature to allow it to be faster than defensive Zapdos and neutral nature Rillaboom, but Adamant is also an option for more damage output. An EV spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe can be used along with an Adamant nature, which makes Tapu Bulu faster than positive nature Aegislash and Magnezone, while the HP gives it an extra point of recovery while Grassy Terrain is up.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu best fits on offense and bulky offense teams in need of a strong wallbreaker that can offensively check the likes of Landorus-T, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R. Heatran takes on Volcarona and Corviknight while also setting Stealth Rock. In return, Tapu Bulu checks Water-types such as Urshifu-R and Slowking while providing Terrain support. Volcarona, Heatran, and Tornadus-T can threaten Tapu Bulu, so switch-ins for them such as Slowking and defensive Dragonite can cover for it while alleviating its pressure to check Urshifu-R. The former is also able to handle faster wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T, while the latter is able to provide Tapu Bulu Heal Bell support. Tapu Koko is able to lure in targets that Tapu Bulu takes advantage of like Ferrothorn and Hippowdon and bring it in with U-turn out while providing a great check to Tornadus-T. Magnezone can remove Corviknight and Skarmory so Tapu Bulu doesn't have to force its way past them, and it benefits from Grassy Terrain decreasing the damage of Earthquake. Kartana is a great partner alongside Tapu Bulu, overwhelming teams once Tapu Bulu removes Flying-types like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with its powerful coverage. Grassy Terrain also complements its Leaf Blade.</p>"

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<p>With a good typing and solid defenses, Tapu Fini is a strong defensive Pokemon that can check many of the metagame's offensive threats, such as Urshifu-R, Buzzwole, and Weavile, while supporting its own team with Misty Terrain, keeping them safe from status. Tapu Fini further supports its team with access to a handful of powerful utility moves, like Trick, allowing it to cripple opposing defensive Pokemon with a Choice Scarf set, and Taunt, which lets it take advantage of more passive foes to set up and shut down opposing setup sweepers. However, Tapu Fini lacks reliable recovery, only learning Draining Kiss, which is a significant Base Power downgrade from Moonblast, and Rest, which is blocked by Misty Terrain. This makes it reliant on Leftovers and susceptible to being chipped down if it loses them or opts for a Choice Scarf set, which can eventually lead to it being overwhelmed by the Pokemon that it is supposed to check, like Weavile and Urshifu-R. Additionally, many prominent metagame threats like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Tapu Koko pose a serious threat to Tapu Fini.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Fini can serve as an entry hazard remover with Defog, but it lacks recovery and doesn't run Heavy-Duty Boots, so other Defoggers like Corviknight are preferred. Tapu Fini can also opt to run Knock Off as a way to hinder opponents, but it tends to get more utility out of Taunt, as many of its common teammates, like Kartana and Weavile, already run Knock Off. Surf or Hydro Pump can be used over Scald for more power, but they trade off the potential to burn incoming Rillaboom, and, in the case of Hydro Pump, very reduced accuracy. Substitute is a niche option on Calm Mind sets to allow Tapu Fini to set up safely but comes at the cost of Taunt's utility. Ice Beam is another niche choice that can let Tapu Fini take Zapdos and Rillaboom switching in by surprise, but both of these Pokemon still outspeed and threaten Tapu Fini while recovering off damage through Roost or Grassy Terrain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Galarian Slowking</strong>: Galarian Slowking is one of the metagame's truest counters to Tapu Fini, as it takes negligible damage from any attacks, especially if it's running an Assault Vest, and easily heals with Regenerator while 2HKOing Tapu Fini with Sludge Bomb. Nasty Plot sets can also overwhelm Tapu Fini, quickly wearing it down with Psyshock or Sludge Bomb. It is crippled by being receiving a Choice Scarf from Trick sets, though Tapu Fini should be wary of hindering its own utility by taking on an Assault Vest or hurting itself by receiving Black Sludge from either its own Trick or Galarian Slowking's.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types can survive any attack from Tapu Fini and threaten it back, particularly Melmetal with Double Iron Bash, while mostly being immune to a Scald burn thanks to Misty Terrain. Ferrothorn can easily take Tapu Fini's attacks and deal huge damage back with Power Whip, though not all Ferrothorn sets include Power Whip, and these sets in particular hate being Taunted. Corviknight can live any one hit from Tapu Fini, but fears being burned and will struggle to damage it back. Additionally, any of these Steel-types are severely hindered by taking a Choice Scarf from Trick Tapu Fini variants.</p> <p><strong>Electric- and Grass-types</strong>: The metagame has a plethora of offensive Electric- and Grass-types like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, Arctozolt, Rillaboom, and Kartana, all of which outspeed and deal significant damage to Tapu Fini.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Because Tapu Fini is fully reliant on Leftovers and the weak Draining Kiss for recovery, it can be quickly worn down by entry hazards and U-turn and Future Sight from opposing Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, and Slowbro, especially if it is running a Choice Scarf set. There are a number of Pokemon that threaten Tapu Fini's Leftovers with Knock Off, including Toxapex and Tornadus-T, the former of which can usually act as a hard counter to Tapu Fini thanks to its typing and access to moves like Haze and Poison Jab.</p>",

Taunt blocks the likes of Blissey and Toxapex from using healing moves in front of Tapu Fini, letting it use these Pokemon as setup fodder, while preventing Pokemon like Volcarona and Clefable from setting up in front of it. 64 Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed Tyranitar, with the rest invested to maximize Tapu Fini's physical bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tapu Fini fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to check a variety of offensive threats. Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T are necessary to check Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko, while Zapdos and Tornadus-T are appreciated to help against Rillaboom and Kartana. All of these in turn benefit from Tapu Fini being able to handle Weavile. Tapu Fini also struggles against Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Melmetal, so teammates like Magnezone and Heatran that can take care of them are needed. Additionally, Tapu Fini does not appreciate taking Knock Off because it relies on the weak Draining Kiss for recovery, so teammates that are less reliant on their items like Skarmory and Corviknight can be considered.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Fini acts as speed control that can also switch into threats like Urshifu-R and Barraskewda in the short-term. Trick has wonderful disruptive potential against passive switch-ins like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Gastrodon by limiting their move choices if the speed control of Choice Scarf is not needed. The final moveslot has a number of options. Taunt is the move of choice, as it prevents the likes of Ferrothorn and Blissey from setting up entry hazards or inflicting status with Thunder Wave or Toxic once Misty Terrain is inactive. This also amplifies the power of Trick, as Pokemon will be forced to Struggle if they are Taunted when Choice-locked. Calm Mind is a viable alternative that turns Tapu Fini into a bulky setup sweeper after using Trick. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Tapu Fini to OHKO Dragapult and Weavile, two of the main Pokemon that this set seeks to revenge kill. 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Jolly Dragonite at +1, while the remaining EVs are invested into HP to maximize bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Fini fits well on teams that desire speed control that can also provide defensive utility. Wallbreakers that appreciate it forcing out the likes of Dragapult and Weavile make for good teammates, such as Blacephalon and Kartana. Kartana particularly appreciates Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain warding off status like burn from Scald and paralysis from Static. As Choice Scarf Tapu Fini does not have the bulk of its defensive sets, it requires a defensive backbone behind it to stave off opposing threats. Ferrothorn is a fantastic partner, as it can act as a Knock Off absorber against the dangerous Weavile as well as be the first line of defense against threats like Barraskewda and Crawdaunt. It can also wear down Tapu Fini's switch-ins, such as Gastrodon and opposing Ferrothorn, with Spikes. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp can check Electric-types like Zapdos and Zeraora, and they reduce pressure on Tapu Fini to switch into Heatran. Much like Kartana, Garchomp enjoys Misty Terrain preventing it from being statused by moves like Scald, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic. Finally, switch-ins to faster Choice Scarf users that can threaten Tapu Fini are necessary due to Tapu Fini's middling Speed tier. Tornadus-T and Zapdos can stave off Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana while providing Defog support, which is important, as Choice Scarf Tapu Fini lacks any form of recovery. Heatran is a sturdy Tapu Lele and Blacephalon check that can also annoy Weavile if running Flame Body. Moreover, it can wear down Gastrodon with Toxic and threaten out Ferrothorn, helping Tapu Fini break through these checks. Attackers that benefit from Trick disrupting shared checks also make for good teammates, with Zapdos appreciating Gastrodon being locked into moves other than Toxic and Weavile enjoying setup opportunities afforded by Toxapex and Ferrothorn being locked into Recover and Spikes, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Kartana is one of the tier's most potent wallbreakers thanks to its titanic Attack and a Speed tier that allows it to outspeed a significant portion of the unboosted metagame. Beast Boost compounds Kartana's offensive capabilities, letting it take advantage of weakened foes to get Attack boosts and tear through opposing teams. Swords Dance and Choice Band sets let it threaten even switch-ins like Zapdos and Corviknight, while Choice Scarf sets utilize its already-high Speed to make it a threatening revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Despite its huge offensive presence, Kartana is extremely frail, especially specially, making finding opportunities to set up a potential challenge and requiring pivot support, since it shouldn't be switching into attacks. Additionally, Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets are vulnerable to being punished by contact-based abilities like Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Heatran's Flame Body, and Zapdos's Static, all of which have the ability to severely hinder Kartana's wallbreaking capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On more offensively oriented teams, Swords Dance Kartana sets can opt to run Life Orb instead of Protective Pads to further enhance its offensive potency, allowing it to OHKO Clefable and Toxapex after Stealth Rock, though this runs the risk of triggering Static or Flame Body. It can also run a Timid nature with 19 Attack IVs and no Attack investment to get Speed boosts from Beast Boost, letting it outspeed Pokemon like Dragapult and Tapu Koko that might otherwise revenge kill it, though this comes at the cost of a huge part of its power. Adrenaline Orb is also a niche option on offensive teams to receive a one-time Speed boost without sacrificing any of Kartana's power. Aerial Ace can be run on Swords Dance variants to hit Kartana's most common check in Buzzwole, which otherwise resists Kartana's commonly run moves. Defog can be run, most commonly on Choice Scarf sets, to allow Kartana to provide entry hazard removal support, though Kartana's general frailty can make this difficult to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Most of Kartana's common checks are Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Corviknight, and Skarmory, as they resist most of its attacks. They are, however, susceptible to being weakened with the combination of Knock Off and entry hazards, and they can also be overwhelmed by Swords Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Buzzwole can check most Kartana variants thanks to its huge Defense and resistance to Kartana's most commonly run moves, but it doesn't appreciate taking Knock Off, as it is vulnerable to entry hazard damage, and it can also be overwhelmed by Swords Dance + Aerial Ace sets.</p> <p><strong>Contact Abilities and Rocky Helmet</strong>: Abilities like Static and Flame Body from Zapdos, Volcarona, and Heatran can instantly cripple Kartana if it's not running Protective Pads, drastically reducing its wallbreaking capabilities. Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn, Rough Skin from Garchomp, and Rocky Helmet from users like Buzzwole and Clefable can all also wear down Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Kartana's frailty means that it's susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Dragapult and Tornadus-T, as well as Choice Scarf users like Urshifu-R.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance in conjunction with excellent coverage, a solid Speed tier, and Protective Pads keeping it from getting damaged, burned, or paralyzed by contact abilities make Kartana a terrifying wallbreaker. Leaf Blade can OHKO a number of defensive staples like Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini, as well as offensive Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Tapu Lele, threatening them and forcing them out. Knock Off can cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Tornadus-T by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots, making them easier to wear down, as well as hitting Ghost-types like Dragapult and Aegislash that would otherwise resist Kartana's attacks. Sacred Sword threatens Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Melmetal that would otherwise wall Kartana, potentially OHKOing all of them after a Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Kartana fits well on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its massive wallbreaking power helping against bulkier teams, in turn benefitting from the presence of slow pivots to get it in safely. Kartana provides potent Knock Off support for its team, as it can easily force repeated switches and gradually wear down checks that are required to be as healthy as possible to handle it. Due to this, it pairs well with entry hazard setters like Landorus-T and Heatran, the former helping weaken Zapdos and Tornadus-T and the latter easily keeping up Stealth Rock against them to maintain pressure after Kartana removes their Heavy-Duty Boots. Due to its frailty, Kartana also benefits from slow pivots like Landorus-T and Slowbro that can safely bring it in.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Kartana efficiently zeroes in on its role as a revenge killer and cleaner; its great natural Speed makes it one of the fastest Choice Scarf users, which allows it to outspeed and revenge kill opposing Choice Scarf users like Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Blacephalon. It can force out Dragapult by threatening it with a super effective Knock Off, as well as pick off other lightning-fast offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Weavile, Zeraora, and +1 Garchomp with Leaf Blade. Kartana can also punish incoming Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, Heatran, and opposing Kartana with Sacred Sword. Smart Strike is a useful late-game move, as it can hit Grass-, Fighting-, and Dark-resistant foes like Dragapult, Buzzwole, Weavile, and Clefable in the same slot. This is important because Kartana wants to lock itself into a move and clean without switching out, due to the nature of Beast Boost. Kartana excels at cleaning up weakened teams late-game, as it only needs one opportunity for a free KO to start snowballing out of control.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A wide variety of offensive teamstyles can appreciate Kartana's revenge killing capabilities and provide wallbreaking support that paves a way for Kartana to clean up. Future Sight support from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Slowbro allows Kartana to bust through checks like Zapdos and Buzzwole, and Slowbro can provide free entry for Kartana with Teleport. Kartana synergizes well with physical wallbreakers like Swords Dance variants of Weavile, Landorus-T, Bisharp, and Garchomp; physical Dragapult; and Melmetal, which can help wear down or break past checks like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight; these teammates are potentially assisted by Kartana removing items from the aforementioned foes. Pivots like Landorus-T and Rotom-W generate momentum and attacking opportunities for both Kartana and the wallbreakers it is paired with. Magnezone can remove Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight to make Kartana a bigger threat. Tapu Lele can provide wallbreaking support for Kartana by helping to overwhelm shared checks like Ferrothorn and Corviknight, luring in the latter and hitting it with Thunderbolt while also protecting Kartana from priority moves like Weavile’s Ice Shard with Psychic Terrain. Rillaboom can work in tandem with Kartana to overwhelm shared checks and provide pivoting support while boosting the power of Leaf Blade with Grassy Terrain.</p>"

Smart Strike mows down Fairy-types, being able to OHKO Clefable, and is a solid midground that hits all of Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Rillaboom in the same slot, finishing off the last after minor chip damage. Knock Off smacks Aegislash and Dragapult trying to switch in, but more importantly, it removes Heavy-Duty Boots from checks like Zapdos and Buzzwole, opening them up to entry hazard damage that will give Kartana and its team an easier time breaking through them. Sacred Sword puts the hurt on the likes of Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal, 2HKOing them without any issue.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Kartana is a great pick for offense teams, using its unmatched immediate power to break holes for fast cleaners like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Weavile to take advantage of and leveraging its solid physical bulk to take strong physical hits like Zeraora’s Close Combat and Choice Band Weavile’s Triple Axel in a pinch. Future Sight from the likes of Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Lele is incredibly beneficial to Kartana, blowing past Buzzwole and removing defensive counterplay from the opponent by easing prediction. The way to get the most mileage out of Kartana is by pairing it with pivots that can get it in safely against its ideal targets; offensive pivots like Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko can force switches with their offensive presence to get Kartana in against easy marks like Clefable and Blissey, and slow pivots like Landorus-T and Slowbro can take a hit first before bringing in Kartana safely. Additionally, Tapu Koko can remove Flying-types like Corviknight and Tornadus-T and threaten out Buzzwole while appreciating Kartana's removal of Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gastrodon. Entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Garchomp synergize well with Kartana's strong Knock Off, as it opens up switch-ins like Zapdos and Tornadus-T to Stealth Rock damage by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Heatran is a notable option, as it has the additional benefit of threatening Defoggers like Corviknight and Tornadus-T that can switch into Kartana, with Kartana being able to help against Defoggers like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W that can force out Heatran.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With an incredible Fire / Ghost STAB combination, sky-high Special Attack, and good Speed tier, Blacephalon is a dangerous offensive threat in generation 8 OverUsed. Choice Scarf sets take advantage of its Speed tier and ability in Beast Boost to revenge kill faster threats like Dragapult and Weavile and cleave through weakened teams, while Choice Specs variants can break through would-be checks like Toxapex and Gastrodon with some chip damage. However, while the extraterrestrial clown has a good Speed tier, Choice Specs sets are vulnerable to being revenge killed by even faster threats such as Weavile and Dragapult, and even Choice Scarf sets have to contend with fellow Ultra Beast Kartana, which outspeeds it by one point and is a fantastic Choice Scarf user in its own right. Moreover, its miserable bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock mean that it can almost never switch into an attack and is extremely reliant on pivoting support to get on the field safely. However, with the right pieces that can compensate for the aforementioned weaknesses, Blacephalon can blow the minds of unsuspecting teams at the drop of a hat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is a more proactive alternative to Substitute on Choice Scarf sets by preventing passive checks such as Blissey, Toxapex, and Hippowdon from setting up entry hazards, spreading status, and recovering, but Toxapex can heavily damage Blacephalon with Knock Off or Scald, while Hippowdon can outright KO Blacephalon with Earthquake. A Heavy-Duty Boots set with Flame Charge can be used as a late-game sweeper against weakened defensive teams without being locked into a move like Choice Scarf sets, but such variants lack the immediate power of Choice Specs and the Speed control of Choice Scarf. Expanding Force is a viable coverage move on Psychic Terrain teams to lure in and KO Toxapex, but unboosted Blacephalon lacks the power to break through Toxapex if Psychic Terrain is not active. Choice Scarf sets can consider running Explosion on hyper offense teams, as Blacephalon has a strong Attack stat that can take advantage of special walls like Blissey and Gastrodon while giving free entry to a teammate after fainting, but this is very risky, as Explosion is still unable to KO the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Sand-boosted special bulk and resistances to both Fire- and Ghost-type moves make Tyranitar the greatest roadblock to Blacephalon in the metagame, as it can retaliate with devastating power from its Choice Band sets or use Blacephalon as Stealth Rock or status fodder. However, Tyranitar generally dislikes Trick, as it is reliant on Choice Band for power or Leftovers for recovery and it can be worn down over the course of a game due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: With its access to Natural Cure, gargantuan special bulk, and immunity to Shadow Ball, Blissey can effectively ignore Blacephalon's attacks and the threat of Toxic while generating progress for its own team by setting up Stealth Rock, spreading status with Toxic or Thunder Wave, or bringing in a wallbreaker with Teleport. However, Blissey despises being Tricked, as a Choice item ruins its ability to flexibly respond to opposing threats, and it is vulnerable to Substitute or Taunt from Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini resist Flamethrower and have the bulk to stomach Shadow Ball before retaliating with Scald or Knock Off. Both hold the distinction of being immune to Toxic thanks to the former's secondary typing and the latter's ability, but both are greatly annoyed by Trick limiting their options when they enter the field. Moreover, Toxapex is vulnerable to Expanding Force Blacephalon on Psychic Terrain teams while Tapu Fini can only check Blacephalon for a limited number of times due to its lack of reliable recovery. Gastrodon is a unique check to Blacephalon that can foil Blacephalon's attempts to Trick it a Choice item with Sticky Hold while possessing reliable recovery to check Blacephalon in the long run, but it can be worn down by Toxic and dislikes Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite outspeeding threats like Garchomp, Tapu Lele, and Urshifu, Blacephalon is still slower than some of the tier's strongest threats in Kartana, Weavile, Dragapult, and Zeraora. Kartana is particularly notable, as it is one of the best Choice Scarf users in the tier, so it can reliably revenge kill any variant of Blacephalon with Knock Off. However, none of these Pokemon can safely switch into Blacephalon.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Specially defensive Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon have the bulk to withstand most of Blacephalon's attacks while being able to OHKO it in return with STAB Earthquake. However, all of them dislike being Choice-locked with Trick or put on a timer with Toxic, while Hippowdon and Landorus-T risk being 2HKOed by Flamethrower from Choice Specs variants. Garchomp and Landorus-T also lack the reliable recovery needed to function as long-term checks to Blacephalon.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragonite's access to Multiscale allows it to stomach Blacephalon's attacks fairly well, while Hydreigon's Dark / Dragon typing resists both of Blacephalon's STAB moves. Both Pokemon also have access to reliable recovery in Roost to keep themselves healthy, making them good long-term checks to Blacephalon. However, Trick or Toxic can cripple Dragonite by breaking Multiscale with status or Stealth Rock. Hydreigon dislikes Toxic putting it on a timer but is one of the rare checks to Blacephalon that does not mind being Tricked a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs due to its respectable Speed tier and high Special Attack.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Blacephalon is one of the best revenge killers and late-game sweepers in the metagame. Trick can cripple defensive checks like Blissey, Tyranitar, and Toxapex that are not particularly bothered by its STAB moves by limiting their move choices whenever they enter the field. There are a number of options for its final moveslot. Fire Blast can be used if Blacephalon desires extra power to make sweeping late-game easier, letting it 2HKO physically defensive Clefable and OHKO Protect Melmetal, but Toxic is a viable alternative that puts checks like Gastrodon and Tyranitar on a timer. Substitute allows Blacephalon to dodge status such as Thunder Wave from Clefable or Toxic from Blissey and Toxapex so it can attack multiple times after using Trick on a target. A Timid nature is generally preferred to maximize Blacephalon's revenge killing and sweeping capabilities, but a Modest nature can be used for extra power at the cost of being outsped by Scale Shot Garchomp at +1, Galarian Moltres with a neutral nature at +2, and other Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R and Timid Tapu Lele.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Choice Scarf Blacephalon offers wonderful speed control and a strong late-game presence, teammates that can punch through defensive cores in the earlier stages of the game synergize extremely well with it. Therefore, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Dragapult make for great teammates; Tapu Lele can remove special walls like Blissey and Gastrodon with Psyshock and wears down a common check in Heatran, while Dragapult forms a Ghost-type spam core with Blacephalon that can overwhelm shared checks like Tyranitar, Tapu Fini, and specially defensive Toxapex. Tapu Lele also has the additional bonus of setting up Psychic Terrain, which blocks priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R when Blacephalon is trying to sweep late-game. As Blacephalon is incredibly frail and weak to Stealth Rock, slow pivots and good hazard removers are almost mandatory teammates. Landorus-T compresses both roles excellently with access to Defog and a slow U-turn, allowing it to remove Stealth Rock from the likes of Heatran and Garchomp, that are often employed to check Blacephalon, before safely bringing it onto the field. Landorus-T can also be a reliable Stealth Rock setter if paired with another Defogger to wear down the likes of Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Tyranitar. Tornadus-T and Zapdos are strong alternative Defoggers that provide pivoting support with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively, and are great checks to Kartana, particularly Choice Scarf variants. Zapdos has the distinction of helping with Blacephalon's checks by threatening Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini and wearing down Ground-types like Gastrodon and Landorus-T that also check Blacephalon with Hurricane and Toxic. As Tyranitar stonewalls Blacephalon, proper checks to it are greatly appreciated. Buzzwole is an exemplary partner, as it not only checks Tyranitar reliably with its access to Roost but also chases out Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp with Ice Punch and special walls like Blissey with STAB Close Combat.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Specs Blacephalon is one of the tier's most frightening wallbreakers with the strong neutral coverage of Shadow Ball and the extra power of Flamethrower that can overwhelm checks such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T while destroying bulky Pokemon like Melmetal that can otherwise stomach Shadow Ball. Trick disrupts switch-ins like Blissey, Toxapex, and Tyranitar by limiting their move options when they enter the field, and it comes with the extra bonus of weakening Choice Band Tyranitar's attacks while still Choice-locking it. The final moveslot has a couple of options; Overheat is preferred choice due to its fairly manageable drawback, and it is still a nuclear option that can wear down checks like Tyranitar and Assault Vest Tornadus-T while beating would-be checks such as Flame Body Heatran. However, Mind Blown is capable of outrageous feats, such as OHKOing specially defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock and guaranteeing the OHKO on physically defensive Clefable and bulky Quiver Dance Volcarona, so it is a viable alternative on teams that desire Blacephalon to do as much damage as possible to open up opportunities for teammates and do not mind it sacrificing itself to do so. Blacephalon usually runs maximum Special Attack investment to hit as hard as possible, but an EV spread of 236 HP / 20 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid Nature allows Blacephalon to boost its Speed with Beast Boost and sweep weakened teams. Blacephalon can also avoid being 2HKOed by Scald from Toxapex with the HP investment.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Blacephalon fits on offensive teams that appreciate Blacephalon's wallbreaking prowess and disruptive potential. Slow pivots that can bring in Blacephalon safely are incredibly important, such as Landorus-T and Slowbro. Landorus-T can check Heatran and Tapu Koko, while Slowbro can wall threats like Garchomp, Urshifu-R, and Barraskewda. Landorus-T has the bonus of being able to remove entry hazards with Defog to maximize Blacephalon's switch-in opportunities or set up its own Stealth Rock to wear down checks to Blacephalon like Heatran and Tapu Fini. Tornadus-T and Zapdos also provide pivoting support with U-turn and Volt Switch respectively while being strong Defoggers in their own right. Moreover, they are reliable checks to the dangerous Kartana and can help out against Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T, which can stomach a hit from Blacephalon before retaliating with Earthquake. Rillaboom is a good offensive teammate, as Grassy Terrain gives Blacephalon a form of passive recovery and weakens the power of Earthquake, allowing it to stay in on Pokemon like Hippowdon that would otherwise KO it. Rillaboom can also threaten Water- and Ground-types that check Blacephalon like Tapu Fini, Gastrodon, and Garchomp with Grassy Glide. In return, Blacephalon can break through Rillaboom's checks, such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole. Dragapult is also a fantastic offensive teammate that can form a Ghost-type spam core with Blacephalon, breaking through shared checks such as Tyranitar, Gastrodon, and Heatran while providing pivoting support with U-turn. Weavile benefits from Blacephalon's wallbreaking power and ability to threaten its checks, such as Corviknight, Buzzwole, and Ferrothorn, and it is a good offensive check against Pokemon that outspeed and threaten Blacephalon like Dragapult and Tornadus-T. Finally, adequate checks to Tyranitar are mandatory, as it resists all of Blacephalon's attacks and can punch through defensive cores with Choice Band sets or generate progress via entry hazards and status with specially defensive sets despite its weakness to Trick. Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Buzzwole can all stomach Tyranitar's moves relatively well and threaten it out with Double Iron Bash, Body Press, and Close Combat respectively. All of them can also check Weavile, which outspeeds Blacephalon and KOes it with Knock Off. Melmetal has the bonus of being a solid Dragapult check, while Ferrothorn can wear down grounded checks to Blacephalon like Gastrodon and Toxapex with Spikes.</p>"

Furthermore, because of its unparalleled Speed tier, it can revenge kill the likes of Dragapult, Weavile, and Tornadus-T. Zeraora can also act as a Volt Switch absorber thanks to its ability Volt Absorb; because of this, it can easily deter other Volt Switch users such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and opposing Zeraora from using the move and take advantage of them to generate momentum or force progress. Unfortunately, Zeraora is pretty frail, meaning that it can't afford to switch into most attacks unlike other Electric-types like Tapu Koko, which can check Pokemon like Tornadus-T more consistently due to its reliable recovery. Zeraora also has to rely on crippling and wearing down Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as it cannot bypass them itself; this hurts its pivoting ability in the process.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blaze Kick can be used over Close Combat to hit Scizor super effectively and easily 2HKO Ferrothorn; however, with this move, Zeraora loses its ability to pressure Hydreigon.

However, it dislikes Knock Off and Toxic. Urshifu-R and Weavile cannot switch into Zeraora but can revenge kill it if it is weakened sufficiently with Aqua Jet and Ice Shard, respectively. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Landorus-T and to a lesser extent Kartana can be dangerous for Zeraora as well.

Its unparalleled Speed tier allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame alongside its amazing coverage makes Zeraora extremely hard to deal with and revenge kill once it has enough boosts, and its ability to force out common Pokemon such as Slowking, Corviknight, and Tornadus-T gives it many setup opportunities. Knock Off is important for hitting Dragapult super effectively. Close Combat is great for hitting targets such as Hydreigon, Heatran, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, as they would otherwise resist or take very little damage from both its aforementioned moves.</p> <p>Bulk Up Zeraora mainly fits on offensive teams, as the support offensive teams provide for Zeraora such as entry hazards and pivoting can give it more setup opportunities. Dual screens Tapu Koko is a great partner for it, as not only do the dual screens and pivoting support give Zeraora more setup opportunities, but also the Electric Terrain increases the power of Plasma Fists, making it harder to wall. Suicide leads such as Landorus-T and Mew are very useful partners for Zeraora, as the hazards they provide can allow Zeraora to apply more pressure to the opposing team. Rillaboom is an excellent partner for Bulk Up Zeraora, as Grassy Terrain halves the power of Earthquake from the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon; furthermore, Rillaboom can revenge kill Excadrill in sand, while Zeraora can heavily pressure Pokemon that Rillaboom may struggle with, such as Corviknight, Dragapult, and Skarmory.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Knock Off allows Zeraora to cripple the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, Swampert, and Ferrothorn by removing their much needed item, especially Leftovers, making it easier for them to be worn down due to their lack of reliable recovery. Close Combat hits Pokemon that resist all of its other moves such as Hydreigon, Kartana, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Toxic allows Zeraora to wear down Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp as well as Tangrowth that can reliably switch into its STAB move. However, Toxic can be replaced with Volt Switch, which gives Zeraora the option to pivot out from an unfavorable matchup versus Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth.</p> <p>Zeraora commonly fits best on offensive and balance teams, as its consistency with providing offensive momentum while also being able to revenge kill and clean late-game thanks to its amazing Speed and primary STAB move makes it fit onto these teams well. Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Scizor are great teammates, as they form a potent VoltTurn core with it; the former two in particular are able to wear down Ground-types that Zeraora struggles with with Hurricane and Toxic, respectively. On the other hand, Zeraora can pivot against Grass-types to bring in Tornadus-T and Scizor and provide an Electric immunity for Tornadus-T. Pokemon that can cover Zeraora's disadvantageous matchup versus Ground-types such as Slowbro, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn while providing utility in Future Sight, slow pivoting, and Spikes respectively make for great teammates. Zeraora's ability to consistently take advantage of Pokemon such as Corviknight, Slowking, and Toxapex due to their fear of being OHKOed by its STAB move makes it a great partner for Pokemon like Rillaboom, Nidoking, and Tornadus-T that generally struggle with these foes. Pokemon that appreciate Zeraora's ability to provide offensive momentum against Grass-types via Volt Switch such as Tapu Lele are very useful teammates, as they can heavily threaten them out. Future Sight support from Slowking and Slowbro is very beneficial, as Ground-types will be more pressured and easily worn down.</p>"

  "Melmetal": {
    "overview": "<p>Making use of its excellent bulk, powerful attacking options, and strong defensive type, Melmetal is a dangerous threat that demands the respect of every serious team, capable of trading hits with almost the entire tier and coming out on top. Its obscenely powerful Double Iron Bash and coverage options combined with its amazing bulk make Melmetal capable of checking and forcing out threats such as Tapu Lele and more softly Weavile and Kartana, while taking the opportunity generated by switching in on these threats to dismantle the opposing defensive core cores with relative ease. Melmetal is also highly customizable, making great use of status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave to facilitate not only itself but teammates as well. However, while it does not outright crumble to any stray special attack, Melmetal is still quite vulnerable to many super effective special attacks coming from the likes of Heatran, Blacephalon, Volcanion, and Volcarona and even common coverage options like Tapu Lele's Focus Blast and Dragapult's Flamethrower. This problem is further compounded by Double Iron Bash's limited PP and the common Water- and Steel-types that resist it, as well as the constant Spikes and Knock Off found within the tier. Furthermore, Double Iron Bash's nature as a multi-hit contact move also makes Melmetal quite exploitable by things such as Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Zapdos's Static, and Heatran's Flame Body if it is not running Protective Pads. However, despite these flaws, Melmetal is still one of the most powerful forces in the tier, ready to drive anyone foolish enough to underestimate its presence, for a lack of a better term, nuts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is an option over Protect on teams that already have a Steel-type that covers most of Melmetal's roles defensively to ease prediction and make checks such as Toxapex and non-Body Press Ferrothorn unable to do anything to Melmetal, letting it continue ravaging the opponent's defensive core; this does, however, compound Melmetal's longevity issue even further as well as making it even more prone to entry hazards. Choice Band sets with Double Iron Bash, Thunder Punch, Ice Punch, Superpower, and 212 Speed EVs to outspeed uninvested Clefable may seem appealing to get the most out of Melmetal's sheer power; however, they require lots of prediction to pull off properly due to how common foes resistant to all of the moves they typically run are. Protective Pads is an option to allow Melmetal to bypass contact effects such as Flame Body, Static, Rocky Helmet, and Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, which is especially synergistic with Thunder Wave to paraflinch otherwise sturdy checks such as Slowbro, Skarmory, and Corviknight into KO range of its coverage options. Lastly, faster spreads on Melmetal may be considered to reach certain benchmarks, one example being a spread of 20 HP / 252 Atk / 128 SpD / 108 Spe to outspeed Hippowdon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Toxapex quite safely come in on Melmetal and do not really mind any attack that Melmetal could reasonably throw at them, and while much more loose of a check, Urshifu-R is able to soak up a hit from Melmetal in a pinch and threaten it back with extremely powerful STAB moves. However, Toxapex very often finds itself 2HKOed by Earthquake, and all the others must be wary of Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight all pose as massive roadblocks to Melmetal, taking basically any attack Melmetal has at its disposal and punishing it with heavy damage from Body Press. Ferrothorn can punish it even further with Iron Barbs and set entry hazards, cripple it with Knock Off, or use Leech Seed; it does have to be worried about taking repeated Superpowers, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Melmetal, while quite sturdy, isn't completely impenetrable; Spikes in particular pose a huge threat to Melmetal, cutting into its HP every time it hits the field and forcing it to play much more carefully when they are around so as to not faint early on. Iron Barbs on Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet users such as Buzzwole and Toxapex also prey on Double Iron Bash's double hit and contact-making nature to force massive damage on Melmetal by simply taking an attack.</p> <p><strong>Volcarona</strong>: Volcarona's mere existence is enough to make Melmetal think twice about using Double Iron Bash; not only does it threaten it with a burn with Flame Body, but if Melmetal is not running Toxic, Volcarona is able to use it as setup fodder, not fearing anything besides a very rare Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos very easily stuffs out Melmetal, only caring about the possibility of Toxic. Otherwise, it threatens Melmetal with paralysis from Static, uses it as an opportunity to remove entry hazards with Defog, or, in the case of offensive variants, uses it to start unleashing an onslaught of powerful Thunderbolts, Hurricanes, and Heat Waves onto Melmetal's team.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Pokemon such as Volcarona, Heatran, and Rotom-W all heavily threaten Melmetal with the possibility of getting burned, which puts it almost entirely out of commission. Not only is the negation of Leftovers recovery crippling, but halving the Base Power of Melmetal's moves makes it almost completely unable to make any meaningful progress besides inflicting Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Protect + Leftovers": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Taking advantage of its natural bulk and the extended longevity provided by Leftovers and Protect, Melmetal receives some much desired staying power, consistently switching into the likes of Tapu Lele, non-Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking, and with proper scouting, it even helps handle the likes of Weavile, Tyranitar, and Kartana. Protect allows Melmetal to gain extra recovery from Leftovers, scout moves, and turn the tables on opposing Choice item users such as Dragapult and Volcanion that may try to force Melmetal out with the threat of a move it cannot hope to take. Earthquake is great coverage in tandem with Double Iron Bash, demolishing common Steel-resistant foes like Heatran, Toxapex, and opposing Melmetal, while Superpower is an option to hit Ferrothorn significantly harder while maintaining good coverage against Heatran and opposing Melmetal. Toxic is used in the last slot to cripple Pokemon that withstand the combination of Melmetal's coverage such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Zapdos, while Thunder Punch is an alternative option that can allow Melmetal to hit Corviknight and Skarmory very hard and still put meaningful pressure on Slowbro. Thunder Wave may also be considered over Toxic or Thunder Punch to allow Melmetal to slow down many Pokemon that would otherwise be faster and capitalize on slower targets with the nauseating combo of full paralysis alongside Double Iron Bash's extremely high flinch chance. High Horsepower is an option over Earthquake on teams making use of Rillaboom or Tapu Bulu; however, the loss in power, contact properties, and imperfect accuracy make it suboptimal outside of such teams. The listed EV spread allows Melmetal to outspeed everything up to Gastrodon and maximizes recovery from Leftovers, dumping the rest of the EVs into Attack and Special Defense to help it check Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Galarian Slowking while letting it hit back as hard as possible. It is preferred to invest in Special Defense because Melmetal's HP and Defense stats are already naturally high.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Melmetal fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check many Psychic- and Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, Tapu Fini, and Clefable while not letting up as much offensive pressure as other Steel-types. As such, Pokemon that enjoy having something to fall back on against these Fairy-types such as Dragapult, Garchomp, Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, and Weavile make for excellent teammates; Garchomp in particular is a strong defensive teammate that can check Heatran and scout Tapu Lele with Protect to bring Melmetal in with much less fear, also setting Stealth Rock to put even more pressure on the opposing team. Because Melmetal is so easily pressured by Spikes, it is also important to bring a Defogger such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, or Landorus-T that keeps these entry hazards off the field to promote Melmetal's ability to play the long game. Rillaboom is another great teammate that takes advantage of Melmetal's ability to pressure shared checks such as Zapdos and Ferrothorn, while in return, Rillaboom makes Melmetal even more difficult to remove from the game thanks to Grassy Terrain halving the power of Earthquake and providing it even more passive recovery. On such teams, however, it is much preferred to run Superpower over Earthquake to avoid suffering the same power drop from Grassy Terrain. Swords Dance Weavile is notable as a deadly partner for Melmetal early- and late-game, absolutely loving Melmetal forcing massive damage on Ferrothorn and Toxapex so Weavile can sweep later on in the game. Melmetal's Protect can even help scout Shadow Ball from the likes of Dragapult and Blacephalon to allow Weavile to get a free switch opportunity to get a Swords Dance off. Urshifu-R and Dragapult both make for great offensive partners thanks to Melmetal reliably taking advantage of and breaking through shared checks like Slowbro and Toxapex in the case of Urshifu-R and Clefable and Blissey in the case of Dragapult, while in return, they put immense pressure on many of the Steel-types Melmetal struggles to make progress against. Magnezone is also a notable teammate, trapping troublesome Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight for Melmetal and making it even scarier to deal with.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Running Assault Vest on this set increases Melmetal's special bulk, making it better at switching into and checking special attackers like Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Dragapult. Double Iron Bash is Melmetal's main wallbreaking move, and thanks to the boost from Iron Fist, it can 2HKO neutral targets barring Buzzwole. Earthquake hits the likes of opposing Melmetal, Heatran, Toxapex, and Victini, which resist Double Iron Bash. Superpower can be used instead to hit Ferrothorn and Kartana much more powerfully, with Ferrothorn otherwise checking Melmetal and Kartana threatening it off the field with Sacred Sword. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight. Ice Punch decimates Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T and Flying-types that aren't hit super effectively by Thunder Punch, namely Zapdos and Dragonite. 92 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Melmetal OHKO Dragapult and Tapu Koko with Double Iron Bash, 12 Speed EVs let it outspeed Toxapex, and the rest is invested in HP and Special Defense to maximize special bulk, allowing Melmetal to survive two Flamethrowers from Choice Specs Dragapult. 176 HP EVs also allow Melmetal to survive V-create from Victini after Stealth Rock. It's worth running more Special Defense than HP, since its HP is naturally high.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Melmetal fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the offensive and defensive utility it can compress into one slot. Landorus-T is a great teammate for it on these types of structures, since it's able to soft-check Fire-types like Heatran and Victini and Ground-types like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T, as well as providing entry hazard removal with Defog and pivoting with U-turn to bring Melmetal in safely. Tapu Koko provides offensive support by setting Electric Terrain, powering up Thunder Punch and giving Melmetal a chance to 2HKO bulky walls like Slowbro, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Misty Terrain support from Tapu Fini protects Melmetal from status conditions, such as burn from Flame Body and Scald and paralysis from Thunder Wave and Static. Rillaboom is a great partner for Melmetal if it's running Superpower over Earthquake, as Melmetal can make progress against Ferrothorn for Rillaboom, while Rillaboom can beat the bulky Water-types that give Melmetal trouble, namely Slowbro and Rotom-W. Rillaboom also sets Grassy Terrain on switching in, weakening Earthquake damage from Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Excadrill and giving Melmetal a form of passive recovery. Dragapult serves as vital speed control for bulky offense structures and can switch into anticipated Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Blaziken and Urshifu-R that would otherwise be able to overwhelm Melmetal, and it also appreciates Melmetal annihilating its checks like Blissey, Clefable, and Tyranitar so it can clean up late-game. Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T are able to come in on the Ground- and Fighting-types Melmetal doesn't like facing off against, and Melmetal is able to bash through the Fairy- and Ice-types the Flying-types struggle with such as Clefable, Weavile, and Arctozolt.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Rillaboom is a vicious wallbreaker thanks to its good coverage and access to a strong priority move in Grassy Glide. Grassy Glide is capable of immediate monstrous damage with a boost from both Grassy Terrain and Life Orb, OHKOing Urshifu-R and Choice Band Tyranitar while putting immense pressure on Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Slowbro. Knock Off allows Rillaboom to punish Flying-type Pokemon like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T that may want to switch on it by removing their items, exposing the latter two's Stealth Rock weakness while hindering the defensive utility of the former by either harming its longevity or removing its ability to punish contact moves. Superpower nails Steel-types like Melmetal, Heatran, and Ferrothorn that may feel comfortable coming in on Grassy Glide, OHKOing them at +2, while also being an excellent form of neutral coverage to hit foes like Corviknight and Galarian Moltres. Adamant is mainly used for the general power boost; however, a Jolly nature lets Rillaboom outspeed the likes of Urshifu-R and Tapu Lele without Speed-boosting natures. Life Orb gives Rillaboom an extra boost in power, guaranteeing an OHKO on Garchomp and Landorus-T with +2 Grassy Glide and a 2HKO on Skarmory with +2 Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Rillaboom fits best on offense teams to help overwhelm common defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran. Other offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Zeraora threaten Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T that check Rillaboom. In return, Rillaboom can assist in overwhelming common shared checks like defensive Heatran and Melmetal. Additionally, Weavile heavily appreciates Rillaboom threatening bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini, making its cleaning ability much stronger late-game. Heatran, Volcanion, and Urshifu-R lure in Water-types like Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini, giving Rillaboom the chance to switch in and force them out. In return, these Pokemon can overwhelm Steel-types like Corviknight, Melmetal, and Heatran, which would otherwise discourage using Grassy Glide. Entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Garchomp can provide chip damage and wear down common checks to Rillaboom such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, Buzzwole, and Dragonite. Additionally, these Pokemon all boast access to other useful utility moves like Toxic and Knock Off, further wearing down the aforementioned Pokemon. Heatran in particular synergizes amazingly with Rillaboom, heavily appreciating Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain reducing the power of Earthquake and providing additional longevity while being able to threaten common checks to Rillaboom like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Buzzwole. Magnezone is another solid offensive partner, removing Steel-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn that would otherwise check Rillaboom.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Rillaboom becomes an incredibly fearsome revenge killer, making use of a boosted Grassy Glide to dispatch the likes of Weavile, Barraskewda, and Zeraora while Grassy Terrain is up, as well as having fierce wallbreaking potential and providing crucial pivoting support. Wood Hammer takes Rillaboom's wallbreaking power to unsettling highs, thrashing neutral targets like Toxapex and Clefable and even 2HKOing frailer Grass-resistant Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and opposing Rillaboom. Wood Hammer can also be substituted out for Superpower, which allows Rillaboom to whack the likes of Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran, most notably OHKOing specially defensive variants of the last. Knock Off is a strong coverage move that lets Rillaboom remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole, making them vulnerable to entry hazards; remove Rocky Helmet from the likes of Corviknight and Skarmory, allowing Rillaboom to pivot on them unpunished later on; and hit Pokemon that resist both Grass and Fighting like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult, and Aegislash super effectively, often for an OHKO. U-turn allows Rillaboom to generate momentum and pivot in frailer teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits the best on offense and bulky offense teams, being able to work in tandem with other wallbreakers and cleaners as well as provide revenge killing support for defensive cores. Heatran has great synergy with Rillaboom, as it is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the metagame that can pressure Defoggers like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Corviknight, which are also some of the best checks to Rillaboom. This is aided by Rillaboom's ability to remove Leftovers from Corviknight and Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T and Zapdos with Knock Off so that Heatran's Stealth Rock can wear them down. Additionally, Heatran appreciates Grassy Terrain weakening opposing Earthquake and giving it additional passive recovery, especially when running Protect. Frail wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Weavile and Choice Specs Dragapult appreciate Rillaboom's ability to force switches and use U-turn to pivot them in safely; in return, Weavile can work together with Rillaboom to wear down shared checks like Buzzwole, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, while Dragapult can threaten the aforementioned Pokemon with its powerful special attacks. Fire-types like Victini and Blaziken can threaten all of Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight for Kartana, while Tapu Lele can threaten the first and draw in and chip down the last two. Magnezone makes for a good offensive partner because it can forcefully remove the likes of Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Kartana appreciates Grassy Terrain boosting its Leaf Blade and can work in tandem with Rillaboom to chip away at shared checks like Corviknight and Tornadus-T.</p>"

  "Corviknight": {
    "overview": "<p>Corviknight is an amazing Defogger and defensive pivot thanks to its stellar defensive typing, solid movepool, and great bulk. With these traits, Corviknight finds itself being ran to check a myriad of offensive threats in the metagame like Garchomp, Weavile, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele. Unlike other Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, its typing gives it a neutrality to Stealth Rock, allowing it to function without Heavy-Duty Boots and instead run items like Leftovers or Rocky Helmet. Its ability Pressure is what sets it apart from other Defoggers, stalling out opposing entry hazard setters so hazards are more likely to stay off the field the longer a game goes on. Corviknight can also function as a defensive sweeper, with its combination of Iron Defense and Body Press letting it boost against physical sweepers like Garchomp and Weavile and then beat them afterward. One major downside of Corviknight is that it can't slot in all the coverage it wants on one set, which means it often falls short in checking everything it wants to. Without Brave Bird, Rillaboom and Volcarona are free to set up on it, and without Body Press, Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal are given endless switch-in opportunities. Corviknight also suffers from general passivity into numerous metagame threats like Zapdos, Garchomp, and Volcanion, letting it get taken advantage of and making it a worse pick compared to other Defoggers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shed Shell can be ran on the Defog set to avoid being trapped by Magnezone, but this is a fringe pick, since Leftovers and Rocky Helmet are consistently better options against teams lacking a Magnezone, and Corviknight can U-turn out on a predicted switch-in. A Bulk Up set with Special Defense investment running Bulk Up, Substitute, Roost, and Brave Bird is a niche pick ran on hyper offense teams to sweep through bulkier teams that are passive against it, since some hyper offense teams struggle with much fatter teams that can deal with the hard-hitting attacks they employ. Power Trip is an option over Substitute to break through defensive teams more quickly, though without Substitute, it's more prone to chip damage, paralysis, and burn from defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Toxapex.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Zeraora are able to threaten Corviknight with Electric-type STAB moves and safely come in, especially if Corviknight is running Brave Bird, and even if Tapu Koko and Zapdos both sustain lots of damage, they have reliable recovery in Roost, so they can keep checking it throughout the game. Magnezone has the added bonus of trapping Corviknight with Magnet Pull so it can't switch out, threatening to KO the latter with Thunderbolt and giving teammates like Rillaboom and Garchomp room to break through the rest of the team. Tapu Lele can slot in Thunderbolt or Thunder as coverage in order to break past Corviknight, and Melmetal can fit Thunder Punch to deter Corviknight from switching in.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Volcarona is able to set up on Corviknight variants lacking Brave Bird and threaten it with Fire-type STAB moves, and Blacephalon can OHKO Corviknight with Fire Blast even when unboosted. However, both Pokemon dislike taking Brave Bird, so they cannot freely switch into Corviknight without scouting its moveset. Heatran is one of the few Stealth Rock setters that can reliably beat Corviknight with Magma Storm or Eruption but dislikes switching into Body Press. Volcanion is a Fire-type who can pick off Corviknight with Flamethrower while also boasting above-average physical bulk, so it has an easier time switching into Corviknight than the aforementioned Pokemon. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking run Fire-type coverage like Fire Punch and Flamethrower to reliably 2HKO Corviknight.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers like Choice Specs Aegislash and Dragapult can both utilize their neutral Ghost-type STAB Shadow Balls to punish Corviknight from the special side, since it typically invests more in Defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defog Corviknight functions as a bulky entry hazard remover that can Defog in front of common hazard setters such as Landorus-T and Clefable thanks to its mixed bulk and amazing typing. Body Press is Corviknight's main way of hitting opposing Steel-types that would otherwise wall it like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran. Brave Bird is a viable alternative to hit Ghost-types like Dragapult and Blacephalon so they can't come in for free, prevents Volcarona from coming in and threatening Corviknight with its Fire-type STAB moves, and lets it more easily beat Rillaboom and Buzzwole. U-turn lets Corviknight pivot out of bad matchups and generate momentum. Leftovers gives Corviknight passive recovery, increasing its longevity and making it easier for it to check multiple threats easier throughout the course of a game. Rocky Helmet is an option that allows Corviknight to punish contact attackers like Kartana and Melmetal as well as U-turn spam from the likes of opposing Corviknight, Rillaboom, and Landorus-T. The shown EV spread gives Corviknight enough special bulk to live 2 Shadow Balls from Modest Choice Specs Dragapult after Leftovers recovery, with the remainder of the EVs being put into physical bulk to live two Crunches from Choice Band Tyranitar. If running Rocky Helmet, a spread running maximum Defense is recommended to better live and punish physical attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Corviknight is best used as a defensive pivot and Defogger on a wide variety of teams ranging from bulky offense to stall. Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora greatly appreciate Corviknight's typing that allows it to check Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp. Hippowdon and Gastrodon form a great core with Corviknight on fat and stall teams, since they are able to switch into Electric-type attacks from the aforementioned Pokemon, with Corviknight checking Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana for them. They're also able to take on Heatran, a Stealth Rock setter that is reliably able to beat Corviknight. Specially bulky Water-types like Gastrodon, Shed Shell Toxapex, and Slowking are able to switch into and check Fire-types Corviknight struggles with like Heatran and Volcarona, and Corviknight is able to check strong physical attackers they struggle with like Garchomp, Weavile, and Melmetal for them. Hazard-weak wallbreakers like Blacephalon and Arctozolt love pairing with Corviknight, since it has great matchups into a majority of hazard setters, so it can reliably keep hazards off the field and give them more room to come in. These wallbreakers, among others like Urshifu-R and Rillaboom, also love Corviknight's slow U-turn to bring them in safely. Pokemon that are highly dependent on their item like Volcarona and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's ability to absorb Knock Off from Pokemon like Weavile and Ferrothorn, since it isn't as dependent on its item to function. Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's ability to check Weavile, as it is one of the few feasible checks to it even after a Swords Dance boost. Weavile itself is a great partner for Corviknight, being able to check and revenge kill Dragapult while Corviknight can pivot and keep hazards off the field, ensuring Weavile gets on the field safely even after its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed.</p>"

      "Iron Defense": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Iron Defense Corviknight is a stalwart physical wall that often shows up on stall teams requiring a dedicated check to physical attackers such as Kartana, Melmetal, and Rillaboom while also removing entry hazards effectively with the combination of Defog and Pressure. Maximum investment in physical bulk is preferred to let Corviknight handle the threats it is supposed to check and will allow it in some sparse scenarios to sweep with boosted Body Press. The choice between Leftovers and Shed Shell will come down to how pressured Corviknight will be to getting trapped by Magnezone. If Corviknight is the team's primary Defogger and check to the aforementioned physical attackers, it should often run Shed Shell.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Iron Defense Corviknight is a good physical wall, but it still has to be supported by teammates that can come in and check threats that Corviknight can't handle. Unaware walls like Quagsire and Clefable pair well with Corviknight, since they will check Pokemon that Corviknight can't reasonably handle like Swords Dance Garchomp with Fire Fang, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Swords Dance Weavile. Corviknight also pairs well with Toxapex, since Toxapex can come in and check physical attackers like Choice Band Urshifu-R and Barraskewda, which otherwise have good odds to 2HKO Corviknight. Physical tanks such as Buzzwole also support Corviknight, as they check stallbreakers such as Bisharp and Choice Band Tyranitar that can threaten to break through Corviknight. Iron Defense Corviknight is also threatened by strong special attackers like Blacephalon, Dragapult, and Volcanion, so a good partner can be found in Blissey, which can effortlessly wall these attackers, allowing Corviknight to keep up its walling capability. Corviknight has a propensity to let in Magma Storm Heatran that can threaten to trap and KO it, so specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Garchomp make good partners to it, as they can tank Heatran's attacks and force it out. These Ground-types also check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos, which Corviknight is otherwise threatened by.</p>"

  "Dracozolt": {
    "overview": "<p>In sand, Dracozolt is one of the tier's most threatening wallbreakers thanks to its great Speed and signature move Bolt Beak, which doubles in power when Dracozolt moves first. It easily beats both offensive and defensive staples like Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Whether it is by trapping and weakening Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp with Fire Spin or simply running coverage, Dracozolt can overcome traditional checks to Electric-types. Unfortunately, Dracozolt is reliant on sand, as it is very slow and easy to offensively pressure outside it. It has mediocre bulk and can be worn down quickly by entry hazards, especially with Life Orb. Finally, Dracozolt is reliant on prediction to nail switch-ins to Bolt Beak and utilize limited sand turns, which sometimes makes it very underwhelming.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast can be used over Fire Spin on the Substitute set for more immediate damage against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Melmetal. However, it requires a lot of prediction to be effective, and these Pokemon are still able to pivot around Dracozolt, making Fire Spin's ability to trap them preferred. Taunt can be used on the Life Orb set to force out passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, but Dracozolt dislikes having to give up a coverage move for it, and it should spend its sand turns attacking. High Horsepower can replace Earthquake on teams with Rillaboom so Dracozolt is not weakened by Grassy Terrain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert are some of the very few reliable checks to Dracozolt, tanking even Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteors and OHKOing back with Earthquake. However, Swampert is chipped down quite easily. Utility Excadrill is capable of walling Dracozolt if it does not carry Earthquake, while Sand Rush Excadrill outspeeds and revenge kills Dracozolt in sand. Defensive Landorus-T can switch into Dracozolt and force it out, but switching into Draco Meteor and Fire Spin wears it down over time. Other Ground-types like Garchomp and Nidoking can fall to Dracozolt's coverage moves, but they prevent it from freely using its strongest STAB move and revenge kill it outside of sand.</p> <p><strong>Losing Sand</strong>: Dracozolt is unable to accomplish much outside of sand due to its mediocre Speed, below almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier, so you can stall out its sand turns by switching around it or using Protect users like Heatran. However, Dracozolt can overcome these strategies if it predicts correctly. Pelipper, Torkoal, and Alolan Ninetales replace sand with their own weather as well, although they cannot directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves like Weavile's Ice Shard, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide can finish off Dracozolt even in sand if it is weakened, which is fairly likely thanks to Substitute damage or Life Orb recoil, though Dracozolt can get past them with a Substitute up. Substitute can particularly exploit Sucker Punch, and none of these Pokemon can directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Although Dracozolt theoretically possesses the typing to switch into some defensive Pokemon like Slowking, Toxapex, and Zapdos, it cannot do so safely, as they can cripple it with Scald burns or Toxic. Burns weaken it, and both leave Dracozolt worn down even more quickly than usual.</p>",

      "Substitute + Fire Spin": {
        "description": "<p>Draco Meteor is a strong secondary STAB move to hit Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Nidoking. Substitute allows Dracozolt to take advantage of the switches it forces, easing prediction, and avoid status moves from Pokemon it can trap with Fire Spin, such as Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and Tangrowth's Sleep Powder. If Dracozolt has a Substitute up, it can still safely attack one time outside of sand. Fire Spin allows Dracozolt to trap passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and especially Clefable, easing prediction, and wear down some of its checks that lack reliable recovery, like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. 140 Special Attack EVs let Dracozolt beat defensive Landorus-T. To do this, it must hit Landorus-T on the switch with Draco Meteor, then switch out. Later in the match, the combination of Fire Spin and Draco Meteor will then be able to KO it. 184 Speed EVs allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in sand. The remaining EVs are pooled into Attack to increase Bolt Beak's damage output. A Lonely nature guarantees that Dracozolt survives Clefable's Moonblast from full health and 2HKOes specially defensive Tyranitar with Bolt Beak, and it doesn't weaken Draco Meteor. Leftovers is the preferred item to heal off Substitute damage and weaker attacks.</p> <p>Dracozolt is used exclusively on sand cores. Consequently, Tyranitar or Hippowdon is a necessary teammate. Both of them can also set Stealth Rock for Dracozolt. Excadrill is also common on these sand cores; it can either sweep teams with Swords Dance once Dracozolt has weakened them or cripple shared checks like Tangrowth and Landorus-T with Toxic, making them even easier to trap and eliminate. Dracozolt's ability to trap Clefable and Ferrothorn is appreciated by Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Scizor, and they can give Dracozolt free turns against many of their checks like Corviknight by using U-turn. Skarmory can set Spikes, which is particularly useful for wearing down Dracozolt's checks like Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal as Dracozolt forces them in, and it also checks Excadrill. Dracozolt's poor bulk gives it few opportunities to switch in safely, making Teleport users like Slowbro and Slowking useful. Future Sight from either also stops many of Dracozolt's defensive checks, like Clefable and Landorus-T, from switching into it safely. Landorus-T and Corviknight are helpful teammates to check Pokemon like Excadrill for Dracozolt, and they draw in defensive Pokemon that it beats like Skarmory and bring it in safely with U-turn against them. Landorus-T also cripples Tangrowth and opposing Landorus-T with Toxic.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>With Life Orb's damage boost, Dracozolt can effectively utilize coverage moves to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. Earthquake hits Excadrill and Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and it OHKOes Heatran, which could otherwise survive a hit and do significant damage back with Earth Power. Fire Blast hits Grass-types like Ferrothorn and the rarer Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. 184 Speed EVs and 176 Special Attack EVs allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in sand and OHKO SubRoost Kyurem with Draco Meteor. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to increase Bolt Beak's damage output. A Naughty nature instead of Lonely lets Dracozolt take priority moves from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Weavile slightly better.</p> <p>Either Tyranitar or Hippowdon is required to set sand for Dracozolt. Both can check some offensive threats that Dracozolt struggles against, such as Kyurem behind a Substitute for the former and Sand Rush Excadrill for the latter. Garchomp is another Pokemon that fits on sand cores, and it appreciates Dracozolt wearing down their shared checks like Landorus-T, Clefable, and Tangrowth. Pivots like Dragapult, defensive Landorus-T, and Slowking can draw in Pokemon that Dracozolt can beat, like Mandibuzz, Corviknight, and Blissey, and bring it in safely with U-turn or Teleport to start wallbreaking. Slowking is particularly notable, as Future Sight is useful for pressuring Dracozolt's checks like Landorus-T and Clefable. Corviknight and Skarmory are consistent checks to the majority of Ground-types and Rillaboom, which often trouble sand teams. The former can also use its slow U-turn to bring Dracozolt in safely, while the latter sets Spikes to wear down its checks. Clefable can cripple faster Pokemon like Heatran with Thunder Wave, making Dracozolt not deadweight outside of sand, or support it with Aromatherapy.</p>"

  "Dragapult": {
    "overview": "<p>Sporting a near-unresisted STAB combination, highly customizable coverage moves to target its checks, and a Speed tier that outspeeds almost the entirety of the unboosted metagame, Dragapult strikes fear into entire teams as one of the best wallbreakers in the tier. Its Speed allows it to force out the majority of offensive threats, such as Urshifu-R, Garchomp, and unboosted Kartana, as well as cleave through weakened defensive cores, while its access to U-turn facilitates this by letting it pivot out against its checks switching in so they can be overwhelmed in the long run. Its coverage options ensure that it is not limited to using U-turn early-game either—Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Hydro Pump can nail common checks super effectively, such as Ferrothorn, Melmetal, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Moreover, teams that overprepare for its special sets can find themselves swept by the relatively uncommon but immensely dangerous Dragon Dance sets that greatly punish more passive checks, namely Blissey and Gastrodon. Its Ghost / Dragon typing also gives it numerous entry points in a game, as it can leverage its myriad of resistances to soak up otherwise dangerous attacks in a pinch, such as Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Steam Eruption and Flamethrower from Volcanion. So despite Dragapult's susceptibility to passive damage that can limit its longevity as an offensive pivot, make no mistake: the Galarian dragon will put teams to the sword like no other Pokemon in SS OU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder can be used over Thunderbolt for extra power against specially defensive variants of Toxapex and Corviknight. However, this is not recommended, as risking the chance to miss is usually not worth the extra power, not to mention that such variants typically sacrifice good matchups against Dragapult's offensive partners like Kartana and Tyranitar to take on the Galarian dragon more effectively. Hex can be used over Dragapult's coverage moves if it is paired with status spreaders such as Thunder Wave Clefable and Toxic Heatran, but Dragapult misses not having the immediate offensive coverage quite often, and these status spam strategies can fall completely flat against teams with cleric support. Dragapult can opt to run a Choice Band set to catch teams expecting Choice Specs off guard, as its high base Attack gives it an incredibly strong STAB Dragon Darts to destroy special checks such as Blissey and Tyranitar, but this forces Dragapult to use the unreliable Phantom Force as its Ghost-type STAB move while missing out on the Fire-, Electric-, and Water-type coverage that its special sets have access to.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and specially defensive Toxapex can reliably take hits from Dragapult while healing off any damage taken with recovery moves or Regenerator. However, Hippowdon, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T are vulnerable to entry hazards and can be in range of a 2HKO if worn down enough. Heavy-Duty Boots Blissey and Gastrodon are immune to hazard damage, but both are very passive and take considerable damage from even an uninvested U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Clefable and Tapu Fini are immune to Draco Meteor and Dragon Darts while having the bulk to tank boosted Shadow Balls or Phantom Forces, and Tapu Fini is even immune to status with Misty Surge. However, Clefable is often tasked to check multiple threats in a game and can be overwhelmed by Dragapult's teammates while trying to stop Dragapult from sweeping its team, while Tapu Fini can be worn down by passive damage and repeated Shadow Balls due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Heatran and Melmetal resist Draco Meteor and Dragon Darts while being bulky enough to take on Shadow Ball or Phantom Force, with some variants of Heatran even being able to punish the latter with Flame Body. However, both Pokemon cannot take repeated attacks and are vulnerable to entry hazards due to their lack of recovery. Dragapult can also pressure them with its super effective coverage, such as Hydro Pump against Heatran and Flamethrower against Melmetal.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Tyranitar and Weavile are common Dark-type Pokemon that resist Shadow Ball and can threaten Dragapult with their Dark-type STAB moves. However, Weavile is very frail and will take massive damage if Dragapult uses any other move, while Tyranitar is vulnerable to passive damage and dislikes being hit with a super effective U-turn. Galarian Moltres can be used as a short-term check to Dragapult on more offensive teams, but its weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of reliable recovery limit the amount of times it can switch in. Bisharp looks like a good short-term stopgap to Dragapult, as it resists both Dragon- and Ghost-type moves, but its utter lack of special bulk makes taking Shadow Balls difficult for the chess piece, as it gets cleanly 2HKOed by Modest Choice Specs Dragapult after coming in on a layer of Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Landorus-T</strong>: Landorus-T has Intimidate to check physical sets and possesses the special bulk to survive multiple Shadow Balls or even Draco Meteor while having the ability to retaliate with Knock Off or a strong STAB Earthquake. However, it can be overwhelmed in the long run due to its lack of reliable recovery and is weak to Hydro Pump from Choice Specs sets.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its mediocre bulk, Dragapult can be vulnerable to being revenge killed even when relatively healthy by priority users such as Ice Shard Weavile and Sucker Punch Bisharp as well as Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Urshifu-R. One of the two tier-relevant Pokemon that naturally outspeeds Dragapult, Zeraora, is capable of simply revenge killing it with a super effective Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Dragapult's reliance on holding damage-boosting items makes it vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, status, and weather conditions, which can wear it down over the course of a game before it can sweep.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>By using Choice Specs to boost its Special Attack, Dragapult can take full advantage of its incredible special movepool that can hit the entire metagame at least neutrally. Its STAB Draco Meteor gives it an incredibly powerful option to take out certain Pokemon in one hit if needed before switching out, such as specially defensive Garchomp and Weavile. Shadow Ball is a reliable and spammable Ghost-type STAB move that takes advantage of the dearth of bulky Dark- and Normal-types in the tier save specially defensive Tyranitar and Blissey. Dragapult has a variety of coverage moves that can be used according to the specific needs of its team. Flamethrower destroys Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Corviknight, while Thunderbolt is a great midground option that hits both bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Finally, Hydro Pump is a viable coverage move that washes away specially defensive Heatran, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T, with the extra power over Surf being important in securing the 2HKO on Heatran and Hippowdon. U-turn allows Dragapult to pivot out against its checks with the bonus of inflicting super effective damage on Dark-types such as Weavile and Tyranitar. Infiltrator is the preferred ability for Dragapult to let it ignore Substitute and Light Screen, allowing it to greatly pressure offensive teams. A Modest nature is preferred, as it allows Dragapult to push through its already shaky checks more easily, but a Timid nature can be used if outspeeding threats such as Tapu Koko and Jolly Weavile is more important.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragapult's ability to U-turn out against its checks makes it a fantastic offensive partner for Pokemon that can break through them or wear down shared checks. Urshifu-R can threaten Heatran, Melmetal, Landorus-T, Tyranitar, Blissey, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon while being an offensive check to Weavile. Kartana destroys Clefable, Tapu Fini, Tyranitar, Blissey, and the aforementioned Ground-types while providing Knock Off support against the likes of Corviknight, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Melmetal. Choice Band Tyranitar can weaken or take out almost all of the aforementioned checks, such as Clefable, Blissey, opposing Tyranitar, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Meanwhile, Dragapult can leverage its STAB Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball to threaten its partners' checks in return, such as Slowbro for Urshifu-R, Zapdos for Kartana, and Buzzwole for Tyranitar. Tapu Lele is also a great partner, as it can help Dragapult overwhelm common checks such as Melmetal, Ferrothorn, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. As for more defensive partners, Heatran is a wonderful teammate with its ability to trap and remove Toxapex, Clefable, and Blissey as well as its flexibility to either check Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Tapu Lele with a specially defensive set or greatly annoy Weavile, Dragapult's greatest offensive check, with a physically defensive set utilizing Flame Body. It also appreciates U-turn support from Dragapult to either set up Stealth Rock or spread status with Toxic. Melmetal is a more offensively-inclined Steel-type partner that can check Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele while being a good short-term stopgap to Weavile. In return, Dragapult threatens physically defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Buzzwole, and Zapdos for Melmetal. Slowbro can switch into some of Dragapult's checks such as Melmetal and Landorus-Therian while being able to safely bring Dragapult onto the field with its slow Teleport. It is also a good check against rain teams, which take advantage of weather to outspeed and threaten Dragapult with Swift Swim Pokemon. Corviknight also provides Dragapult with slow pivoting while checking Dark-types such as Choice Band Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp with Body Press and Tapu Lele with Iron Head.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Dragon Dance enables Dragapult to get the most out of its superior Attack stat while also boosting its already tremendous Speed to ridiculous heights, foiling would-be revenge killers like Choice Scarf variants of Kartana and Tapu Lele. Dragapult can find free opportunities to use Dragon Dance by taking advantage of Pokemon Choice locked into an unfortunate move, such as Choice Band Urshifu-R locked into Close Combat, as well as using its offensive presence to scare out Pokemon like Slowbro and Ferrothorn. Dragon Darts is a high-powered STAB option that shreds neutral targets like Tornadus-T, Urshifu-S, and Blissey. Phantom Force is Dragapult's other STAB attack, hitting Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele and overall being much harder to switch into due to the lack of common resistances to Ghost, and even less that can handle Dragon Darts. Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast allows Dragapult to OHKO Ferrothorn and 2HKO specially defensive Corviknight and Melmetal, while Flamethrower trades some of the raw power of Fire Blast for extra consistency. Dragon Fang can be used over Life Orb to avoid the recoil damage from Dragapult, allowing it to still sweep after being significantly chipped down, at the cost of having a comparatively weaker Phantom Force and Fire Blast. Clear Body is chosen to allow Dragapult to ignore Intimidate as well as the rare Sticky Web. A Lonely nature is chosen to maximize Dragapult's damage output on both sides of the spectrum and because, after a Dragon Dance, Dragapult is fast enough to outspeed relevant Choice Scarf users while using a neutral nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is generally used on hyper offense teams, with Dragapult providing a good natural Speed tier to threaten out Pokemon like Choice Specs Blacephalon and Swords Dance Kartana, which would otherwise be incredibly threatening to those structures. In return, these teams can support Dragapult with Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales or dual screens from setters like Tapu Koko. Dragapult fears priority users like Choice Band Weavile and Choice Band Rillaboom, which can halt Dragapult's sweep with their strong priority moves, so pairing Dragapult with an answer to them like Scizor or Flame Body Heatran can alleviate the problem. Heatran is an especially good teammate for a few reasons: it can trap and remove checks to Dragapult like Clefable and Toxapex with Magma Storm and Taunt; is a fantastic Stealth Rock setter on hyper offense teams thanks to its ability to threaten the tier's best Defoggers in Corviknight, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T; and is a sturdy check to Tapu Lele, particularly Choice Scarf variants, which greatly threaten hyper offense teams.  Swords Dance Garchomp is a good partner on hyper offense teams, as it can switch into and threaten physically defensive Heatran, which can threaten a burn on Dragapult using Phantom Force with Flame Body. Additionally, they can overwhelm shared checks like Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Corviknight.</p>"

  "Urshifu-Rapid-Strike": {
    "overview": "<p>Urshifu-R is a metagame-defining wallbreaker and cleaner thanks to its amazing Attack stat and synergistic, high-base power STAB combo. Its ability to constantly force switches, break through would-be checks with just the slightest bit of chip damage, and bring in other partners with U-turn makes it a huge boon to offensive teams. At the same time, its good item flexibility allows it to tailor its set depending on the team's needs. Urshifu-R isn't without its issues, though; for one, the number of Pokemon that can threaten it or wall it is notable, like Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Slowbro. Urshifu-R has a mediocre 97 Speed stat, meaning Pokemon like Garchomp and Kartana outspeed it and, as such, leave it vulnerable to revenge killing attempts constantly. Its STAB combination is also resisted by some of the best Water-type walls in the metagame, namely Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Its reliance on Surging Strikes is exploitable against contact effects such as Static, Flame Body, Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin. Despite these issues, Urshifu-R remains one of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame, pairing phenomenally with other staples like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Blacephalon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch can allow Urshifu-R to threaten Dragonite and Dragapult. However, this doesn’t achieve much else, as Urshifu-R’s STABs are already powerful, and sacrificing one of its key moves often does more harm than good. A Bulk Up set with Protective Pads and either Thunder Punch or Taunt can allow Urshifu-R to turn into a threatening stallbreaker if given the chance; however, the lack of U-turn means that Urshifu-R sacrifices its ability as an offensive pivot with this set and is vulnerable to the sheer number of faster threats and Choice Scarf users in the metagame, even if it successfully sets up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Tapu Fini can consistently switch into and force out Urshifu-R, with the latter two threatening heavy damage or OHKOes on it with their STAB moves. However, they must be wary of Choice Band-boosted Thunder Punch, especially Tapu Fini, since it lacks reliable recovery. Rotom-W can cripple Urshifu-R with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, but it has to be wary of Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Ferrothorn all threaten Urshifu-R and resist its Surging Strikes, although Close Combat and U-turn heavily punish them if they choose to switch in directly. Rillaboom and Kartana also have the added benefit of outspeeding Urshifu-R with Grassy Glide and base Speed, respectively. On the other hand, Ferrothorn can punish Urshifu-R if it makes an incorrect move thanks to Iron Barbs. Other bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can directly switch into Urshifu-R consistently and punish it with Rocky Helmet, although they are much more niche.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects</strong>: Contact effects from Rocky Helmet users like Buzzwole, Corviknight, Clefable, and Slowbro; Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Garchomp's Rough Skin; and status-inflicting abilities from Zapdos, Heatran, and Volcarona can cripple Urshifu-R if it is not careful, limiting its output considerably. Protective Pads can circumvent this issue entirely, though.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Despite Urshifu-R’s power, its Speed is incredibly middling without a Choice Scarf, which leaves it vulnerable against faster Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Tapu Koko. Dragapult in particular can be problematic, as it not only threatens to OHKO Urshifu-R with Choice Specs Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt but also makes Choice item variants setup fodder for Dragon Dance if it's locked into Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Protective Pads": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Protective Pads Urshifu-R is an incredibly scary pivot thanks to its great Attack, good bulk, and incredible STAB moves that still hit hard without a Choice Band boost. Surging Strikes threaten Water-weak Pokemon like Landorus-T and Victini with the added benefit of bypassing Iron Defense boosts from Corviknight and Skarmory and Substitute users like Volcarona and Arctozolt. Close Combat can threaten a myriad of Pokemon in the tier, such as Steel- and Dark-types like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Weavile, and less bulky neutral targets like Volcanion and Gastrodon. U-turn allows Urshifu-R to bring in a teammate while scouting what the opponent does and chipping walls like Slowbro and Rotom-W. Taunt is typically preferred in the final moveslot, as it allows Urshifu-R to shut down healing moves from Clefable, Buzzwole, and Toxapex; entry hazards from Ferrothorn; and status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from Garchomp and Clefable. However, Aqua Jet gives Urshifu-R a much-beloved priority move that removes weakened threats like Blacephalon, Volcarona, and Blaziken, which could otherwise snowball out of control. Protective Pads prevents Urshifu-R from taking chip damage from Garchomp's Rough Skin, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, and Rocky Helmet held by foes like Corviknight and Buzzwole. It also completely avoids Flame Body burns from Volcarona and Heatran and Static paralysis from Zapdos, allowing it to attack these Pokemon more freely. Protective Pads Urshifu-R can be highly effective when playing as if it is holding a Choice Scarf, so bluffing early-game versus Pokemon like Weavile and slightly chipped Corviknight that cannot outright OHKO it or handle its other sets, can go a long way; however, Urshifu-R's sheer power means that it is not necessary to bluff another item, and Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight can reveal its Protective Pads on contact.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Urshifu-R fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that can make the most of its strengths, so wallbreakers like Weavile, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele can go a long way to help threaten Pokemon that would otherwise give Urshifu-R trouble, such as Slowbro, Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex; in return, Urshifu-R can help deal with the Fire- and Steel-types that give these teammates trouble, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Volcarona. Tapu Koko, in particular, is a phenomenal partner due to it threatening Buzzwole, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Water-types that wall Urshifu-R like Toxapex and Slowbro, while Urshifu-R can deal with Ferrothorn and Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon for Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko's access to U-turn and Volt Switch means that they also make a solid offensive VoltTurn core. Similarly, Dragapult threatens Dragonite, opposing Dragapult, and Kartana on top of other physical stalwarts like Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Slowbro. Spikes users like Ferrothorn and Skarmory help chip checks to Urshifu-R like Tapu Fini and Buzzwole. Similarly, Knock Off users like Weavile and Kartana can remove important items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive targets like Tornarus-T, Buzzwole, and Tapu Fini to help Urshifu-R in combination with hazard support from the aforementioned Spikes setters. Future Sight users like Slowbro, Tapu Lele, and Galarian Slowking can help Urshifu-R wallbreak, as many of the Pokemon that wall it, like non-Light Screen Toxapex, Buzzwole, and Tapu Fini, despise Future Sight. Trappers like Heatran and Whirlpool Tapu Fini target the Water-types that Urshifu-R despises like Toxapex and Slowbro; Tapu Fini can also threaten Dragonite with both Whirlpool and Moonblast. Dragapult, in particular, can cause Urshifu-R issues due to its Dragon / Ghost typing resisting all of its moves while threatening an OHKO with Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt; henceforth, teammates like Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Tyranitar, and Melmetal can decrease its potency. Similarly, Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos can cause Urshifu-R immense trouble, so answers to these threats like Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon are essential.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With a Choice Band equipped, Urshifu-R turns into one of the best physical wallbreakers in the tier, always 2HKOing would-be checks such as physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight after Stealth Rock with Surging Strikes. The fact that it is a multi-hit move helps Urshifu-R break past occasional Substitute from Pokemon like Volcarona, while the guaranteed critical hit lets it bypass Defense boosts from Pokemon like Iron Defense Skarmory and Cosmic Power Mew. Unseen Fist prevents Protect Pokemon, such as Garchomp, Melmetal, and Heatran, from scouting it's moves. Between its two STAB moves, Urshifu-R can hit most of the metagame at least neutrally. For the few that these moves bounce off of, such as Toxapex, Dragonite, and Slowbro, it can easily pivot away from them with U-turn, dealing chip damage and generating momentum. It also provides an easy middle ground in situations where one would otherwise have to make an uncomfortable prediction. Aqua Jet is a strong priority move that can help its team deal with threatening sweepers, such as Volcarona, and other faster threats that are weak to it, such as Blacephalon and Sand Rush Excadrill, which can be especially useful on the offensive teams that Urshifu-R often finds itself on. Ice Punch functions as an excellent lure against what is typically one of its cleanest counters in Dragonite and also allows it to cleanly OHKO Dragapult and Garchomp. Choice Band generally increases the raw power of Urshifu-R significantly; for instance, Choice Band allows it to 2HKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage and always 2HKO physically defensive Clefable. Thunder Punch is an alternative that helps deal with bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. A Jolly nature lets it outspeed important metagame staples such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. An Adamant nature is a less common option for when even more power is desired. It affords Urshifu-R a chance to OHKO Volcanion and defensive Tornadus-T and guarantee a OHKO on Rotom-W.</p> <p>Choice Band Urshifu-R typically requires using more prediction than the Protective Pads set, although you can often just repeatedly use U-turn to create momentum. Effects that punish contact moves, such as Rocky Helmet on Pokemon like Clefable and Buzzwole and Flame Body on Heatran or Volcarona, can be devastating to Choice Band Urshifu-R, particularly when it uses Surging Strikes. Especially on offensive teams, it can be used as a temporary check to Pokemon like Weavile and Heatran, but its mediocre bulk only allows it to check the aforementioned threats once or twice. Additionally, losing its Choice Band to a Weavile's Knock Off can be a major hindrance in its task of breaking through the opposing team. If it is running Thunder Punch, it is generally used as either a middle ground against teams relying on defensive cores, such as Tapu Fini and Corviknight, or as a one-time lure on a bulky Water-type, such as Toxapex or Tapu Fini, due to the danger of staying in while locked into it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Typically, Choice Band Urshifu-R best fits on offensive teams that value its power over the longevity and stability offered by Protective Pads or the Speed offered by Choice Scarf. Offensive teams also often benefit from the ability to use Urshifu-R as a temporary check to Heatran and Weavile, which can be difficult to consistently answer on such teams. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock are very important for Urshifu-R, as they help immensely in wearing down its checks, such as Tapu Fini and Buzzwole, as it switches out with U-turn. Some of Choice Band Urshifu-R's most potent pairings are with powerful wallbreakers, like Tapu Lele, Melmetal, and Nidoking, that can abuse its checks such as Clefable and Tapu Fini. Similarly, Nasty Plot Galarian Slowking is a great partner due to being able to punish Toxapex as well as Fairy-type checks. Rain support from Pelipper can make Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes even more potent. Under rain, it can OHKO physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight, as well as 2HKO Tapu Fini with Surging Strikes after Stealth Rock. Future Sight support from the likes of Slowbro, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Lele can help Urshifu-R break through Toxapex and Buzzwole.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Urshifu-R is a top-tier Choice Scarf user thanks to its good damage output, spammable STAB moves, and access to U-turn. Choice Scarf patches up Urshifu-R's middling Speed tier, making it blow past the entire unboosted metagame, although Urshifu-R is the second-slowest common Choice Scarf user, being outsped by Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Kartana and only outspeeding Tapu Lele. Additionally, Speed-boosting Pokemon like Scale Shot Garchomp, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Volcarona and priority users like Rillaboom can prove troublesome for Urshifu-R's speed control capabilities. What Urshifu-R lacks in Speed, it makes up for in its role compression, checking Weavile and providing excellent pivot support for teammates, which gain opportunities to wallbreak or set up against bulky Water-types. Ice Punch is Urshifu-R's best option against Dragapult and Dragonite, as they resist its STAB moves. Outside of its role against offensive teams, Urshifu-R is still able to make progress against bulky teams with support from Future Sight or Knock Off and entry hazards; however, the Choice Scarf set lacks some of the sheer effectiveness of Protective Pads and Choice Band sets in slicing through bulkier teams due to having to lock into a move without a damage boost or protection from contact effects, making other wallbreakers necessary additions.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Future Sight Slowbro is an excellent partner, as its Future Sight and Teleport pivoting allow Urshifu-R to make progress against teams with walls like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and Tapu Fini while having safe entry from Teleport. Tapu Lele, offensive Zapdos, and Tapu Koko all appreciate Urshifu-R pivoting into them against the physically defensive Water-types that check it, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro, so they can fire off their powerful attacks with safe entry. Tapu Lele in particular is one of the tier's best wallbreakers, patching up Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's weakness to bulky teams that can easily take its hits, while Urshifu-R provides a short-term check to Steel- and Dark-types like Melmetal, Heatran, Weavile, and Tyranitar that can take advantage of Tapu Lele being locked into a Psychic-type move. While Choice Scarf Urshifu-R provides good speed control, Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Kartana can both outspeed it and deal heavy damage, and it fails to revenge kill some threats such as Rillaboom and boosted Garchomp. This makes Zapdos especially noteworthy for its ability to act as an excellent answer to Kartana, Garchomp, and Rillaboom while forming a VoltTurn core with Urshifu-R. Tyranitar and Heatran love Urshifu-R's pivoting to gain entry on Pokemon like Toxapex, Dragapult, and Zapdos, as well as Slowbro for Tyranitar, and they are some of the best Blacephalon checks in the tier. Urshifu-R can be worn down by Rocky Helmet chip damage due to its reliance on contact moves, especially Surging Strikes. Pokemon with Knock Off such as Weavile that can target Rocky Helmet users like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and Skarmory are greatly appreciated, as they make Urshifu-R's attacks much more spammable without the threat of massive chip damage. Weavile can also revenge kill Swords Dance Garchomp, offensively check Dragapult, and wear down bulky Water-types that Urshifu-R struggles with like Toxapex, Rotom-W, Tapu Fini as well as Psychic-types like Slowbro, Mew, and Reuniclus.</p>"
