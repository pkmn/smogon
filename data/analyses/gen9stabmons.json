Threats to Tyranitar include Annihilape, Iron Valiant, Palafin, Gholdengo, and Great Tusk. Tera Water checks Palafin and Gholdengo, while Tera Flying and Fairy check Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Heavy-Duty Boots avoids entry hazard damage, which can be useful with Tera Flying, while Leftovers increases Tyranitar’s longevity. Tyranitar prefers bulky teammates like Corviknight, Rotom-W, and Rotom-C to patch up its Ground weakness. Physically defensive Toxapex is appreciated to handle the likes of Palafin and Iron Valiant and covers for Tyranitar's Fighting, Water, and Fairy weaknesses while also providing entry removal with Mortal Spin. Offensive Gholdengo is a good teammate, as it blocks entry hazard removal while also being able to throw off powerful attacks and spread status with Infernal Parade and Thunder Wave. Powerful offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Palafin can more easily break holes with the chip damage provided by Tyranitar.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp hinders physical attackers more reliably than Scald. Alternatively, Apple Acid breaks down defensive Pokemon such as Garganacl, while Haze neutralizes slow setup sweepers such as Scizor and Freeze-Dry hits Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp super effectively. Roost provides consistent recovery, while Strength Sap makes Rotom-W more effective against physical attackers such as Great Tusk and Chien-Pao, but leaves it unable to recover against Gholdengo. The given Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Jolly Azumarill and uninvested Great Tusk, but more Speed can be run to handle certain threats; 224 Speed outspeeds Palafin, while 240 Speed with a Timid nature outpaces Gholdengo. Tera Steel allows Rotom-W to more easily pivot into Toxapex and take on Dragon-types such as Garchomp. Alternatively, Tera Electric strengthens Volt Switch and makes Rotom-W less vulnerable to Salt Cure. Rotom-W appreciates partners that can pivot such as Ting-Lu, Slither Wing, and Corviknight. Physical walls like Garganacl and Skeledirge after Terastallizing can take on many of the physical attackers that Rotom-W cannot handle, such as Roaring Moon.

Dual screens support gives setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, Iron Valiant, and Belly Drum Azumarill an easier time setting up and makes revenge killing them significantly harder. Parting Shot gives Grimmsnarl a way to pivot the aforementioned Pokemon in. Grimmsnarl can also use Memento, which further drops the stats of foes, although it doesn't allow Grimmsnarl to set up screens afterwards. Taunt stops would-be setup sweepers like Swords Dance Iron Hands and blocks opposing Pokemon like Glimmora from setting up entry hazards. Alternatively, Thunder Wave cripples faster offensive Pokemon like Iron Valiant, whereas Ceaseless Edge sets up Spikes while not being too passive. Tera Ghost allows Grimmsnarl to block Rapid Spin attempts from Pokemon such as Iron Treads and Great Tusk, although it is inadvisable to waste Tera on Grimmsnarl, as your setup sweepers may require it. Azumarill deserves a special mention as a Grimmsnarl partner, as its Water typing and access to moves like Jet Punch and Tidy Up make it a good Ting-Lu and Tyranitar answer, which would otherwise use Grimmsnarl as setup bait for Stealth Rock and Spikes due to being immune to Taunt.</p> "

On its own, it possesses a valued Dark / Steel typing, letting it switch in on Mortal Spin users like Toxapex and Amoonguss to block entry hazard removal, which, combined with Kingambit's overall good bulk and high base Attack, makes it a very valuable part of teams. Swords Dance is the best move Kingambit has for improving its already impressive Attack, making it incredibly hard for Pokemon that do not resist it to survive a +2 Behemoth Bash or Behemoth Blade. Kingambit gains access to Knock Off, which is great for removing items of importance such as Covert Cloak and targeting physical walls that otherwise resist its Steel-type STAB moves such as Skeledirge and Toxapex.

Covert Cloak is a reliable item to avoid annoying secondary effects such as burns, Salt Cure, and stat drops. Metal Coat and Black Glasses are viable alternative item choices, as they work with Supreme Overlord's multiplier.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Kingambit outspeed uninvested slow Pokemon in the tier that would outspeed it otherwise such as Corviknight, Skeledirge, and Sylveon. Tera Flying allows it to completely flip its type matchup, as it makes Kingambit immune to Spikes, resist Fighting-type moves, and immune to Ground-type moves, letting it stay in against Pokemon like Great Tusk, which would otherwise be a fantastic check to Kingambit. Tera Steel allows it to maintain its Mortal Spin blocking capabilities while boosting the power of Behemoth Blade or Behemoth Bash and remaining resistant to Stealth Rock.

Earthquake provides great coverage against many Pokemon in the tier, such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, and Gholdengo. Thunderous Kick is a powerful Fighting-type move that lowers the target's Defense by one stage; this can be helpful in taking down opposing Pokemon that would otherwise halt Great Tusk like opposing Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Knock Off can cripple foes by removing their items, which is great against a lot of Pokemon, as it gets rid of annoying items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Leftovers, and opposing Covert Cloak from Pokemon such as Garganacl, opposing Great Tusk, and Skeledirge. Rapid Spin is a potent utility move that allows Great Tusk to remove entry hazards from the user's side, while Spikes is an alternative to Rapid Spin, as it allows Great Tusk to set up hazards of its own if the user's team already has reliable hazard removal. Shore Up is a good recovery move, as it gets powered up by sand, and Great Tusk can use it often due to its decent Speed and bulk. Covert Cloak is the best item choice for Great Tusk, as it allows it to shrug off secondary effects from moves like Mortal Spin, Thunderous Kick, and Salt Cure without getting punished. This EV spread allows Great Tusk to maximize its physical bulk while still outspeeding some slower Pokemon such as maximum Speed Azumarill and base 100 Speed Pokemon like Volcarona after a well-timed Rapid Spin. Maximizing Attack instead of HP is an alternative option due to Great Tusk's impressive base Attack stat; however, maximizing HP is the preferred way to go to maximize overall bulk. Tera Water allows Great Tusk to turn the tables on physically offensive Water-types such as Azumarill, Palafin, and Gyarados; this allows Great Tusk to tank their STAB moves if needed. Additionally, Tera Ghost is an option to block Rapid Spin from opposing Great Tusk and punish them for not carrying Knock Off. Good partners for Great Tusk include Corviknight, Tyranitar, Slowking, and Toxapex; these Pokemon can provide a way to take on special attacks and help pivot Great Tusk into the battle.

Spikes should be used if reliability and lack of PP are a concern, especially on stall teams. Precipice Blades maximizes damage against Toxapex and other Ground-weak Pokemon like Iron Hands; however, Earthquake is a fine option if accuracy is a concern. There are multiple options for the last moveslot: Parting Shot lets Ting-Lu safely bring in offensive teammates via a slow pivot, Foul Play gives it a better matchup against setup sweepers like Salamence, Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers that Ting-Lu can't handle like non-Taunt Annihilape, and Knock Off can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots from pivots like Tyranitar. Covert Cloak prevents Ting-Lu from being poisoned from Mortal Spin users like Toxapex, while Leftovers gives to it more passive recovery. Both Tera Ghost and Tera Poison allow Ting-Lu to surprise Fighting-types like Iron Hands; Tera Poison grants it an immunity to Toxic and lets it resist Grass-type attacks, while Tera Ghost allows it to spinblock. Alternatively, Tera Fairy and Tera Water provide great resistances to Roaring Moon and Palafin, respectively. Ting-Lu fits in a variety of teams, ranging from bulky offense to stall. Offensive teammates such as Iron Valiant, Palafin, and Iron Hands appreciate that Ting-Lu can both set Spikes and act as a slow pivot with Parting Shot. These three Pokemon also beat Great Tusk, one of Ting-Lu's biggest checks, as it is able to beat it with Fighting-type moves and remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Dondozo are able to check Pokemon that Ting-Lu can't, which include Azumarill, Rotom-W, and Mimikyu.

Dragon Darts can be run over Glaive Rush to more easily ensure the 2HKO on Great Tusk by committing Tera without fainting to bulkier walls such as Great Tusk due to Glaive Rush's self damage multiplier. Earthquake can be used to inflict more damage against Toxapex and Pokemon that resist both Roaring Moon's STAB types such as Fairy-types like Azumarill. U-turn allows Roaring Moon to both maintain momentum when faced with difficult matchups like Ting-Lu and chip the opponent's Pokemon. Tera Dragon maximizes Glaive Rush and Dragon Darts's damage. Roaring Moon fits best alongside offensive teammates that can help to dismantle defensive cores; examples include Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Gyarados. Due to its lackluster coverage against Fairy-types like Azumarill and common physically defensive Tera Fairy users such as Skeledirge and Toxapex, Roaring Moon needs teammates capable of handling them such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, Clodsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo.
