  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its nice typing, access to Coil, and array of strong attacks such as Gunk Shot and Earthquake, Arbok is a very potent threat in the PU metagame. Arbok also has access to priority in Sucker Punch, allowing it to pick off weakened foes and KO many faster Pokemon after a Coil boost. Furthermore, some good defensive capabilities in its access to Intimidate and its pure Poison typing allow Arbok to check Pokemon such as Roselia and absorb Toxic Spikes. However, without the help of Intimidate along with Coil, Arbok is fairly frail and susceptible to even neutral attacks such as Floatzel's Waterfall and Stoutland's Return. Arbok also requires a good amount of support to weaken checks such as Misdreavus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Coil set with Rest along with Shed Skin can be used to absorb status moves and act as a late-game sweeper, though Arbok can be revenge killed much more easily with the loss of Sucker Punch, and it's more vulnerable to physical attackers because of the absence of Intimidate. Shed Skin can also be used on the main offensive set, although Arbok is then unable to switch into Pokemon such as Simisage. Choice Band or Choice Scarf along with Switcheroo can be used for immediate power or Speed, though Arbok loses its sweeping capabilities with the loss of Coil. Seed Bomb or Aqua Tail can be used to deal more damage to Golem and Solrock, with the former also dealing considerably more damage to Relicanth. However, they deal less damage to Pokemon such as Pawniard and Stunfisk. Crunch can be effective to take on Misdreavus, though it's a very situational move and doesn't provide coverage for many other Pokemon. Substitute can be used to avoid status moves while maintaining the utility that Intimidate gives, but Arbok then misses out on priority in Sucker Punch. An EV spread of 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used for extra bulk while still outspeeding the likes of Pawniard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Stunfisk, Golem, and Gabite can switch into Arbok's Gunk Shot, and all of them take little damage from Earthquake and Sucker Punch; additionally, all of these Pokemon can use Arbok to set up Stealth Rock. However, if Stunfisk switches into Arbok as it sets up a Coil, Arbok can beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Grumpig, while they struggle to switch into Arbok, can both revenge kill Arbok. However, Grumpig lacking Colbur Berry and Mr. Mime can both be KOed by boosted Sucker Punch with some prior damage. Defensively, Solrock can take anything Arbok wants to throw at it, burn it, then wear it down with Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL don't mind Gunk Shot, and both of the two can burn Arbok. However, if Misdreavus is offensive and doesn't carry Will-O-Wisp, Arbok can KO it with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Because Arbok is very frail, it struggles to take hits such as Floatzel's Hydro Pump, Dodrio's Brave Bird, and Monferno's Flare Blitz, though they must be at high health to avoid being KOed by Sucker Punch.</p>",

      "Offensive Coil": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Coil boosts Arbok's Attack, Defense, and accuracy, allowing it to pick up extra KOs, take hits more comfortably, and giving Gunk Shot a 100% hit rate at +1. Gunk Shot can deal a lot of damage to even neutral foes such as Stoutland and Monferno. Earthquake hits Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types such as Golem, Stunfisk, and Pawniard. Sucker Punch allows Arbok to pick off weakened foes and frailer Pokemon such as Kadabra and Zebstrika while also dealing a lot of damage to fast and frail Pokemon at +1.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A fully offensive EV spread with an Adamant nature allows Arbok to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding Pokemon such as Pawniard and slower variants of Grumpig. Intimidate allows Arbok to switch into or set up on physical attackers such as Simisage, while Black Sludge gives Arbok passive recovery, allowing it to switch into these Pokemon multiple times. Alternatively, Shuca Berry allows Arbok to take Ground-type moves much more effectively, allowing it to lure and possibly beat Golem and Stunfisk. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Monferno and Timid Grumpig, though Arbok loses a lot of power and misses out on some KOs, namely the 2HKO on Stunfisk at +1; however, to combat the loss in power, Arbok can make use of Life Orb, though this detracts from Arbok's longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arbok should mainly be used as a wallbreaker, making it easier for its teammates to sweep late-game. Arbok can also use Coil to sweep late-game itself, picking off weakened foes with Sucker Punch. Arbok can switch into and should set up on Pokemon that can't deal much damage to it such as Roselia. Arbok can lure the likes of Golem and Stunfisk into thinking they can KO it, but Arbok can survive a hit thanks to Shuca Berry and KO them in return. Do not switch Arbok into Pokemon with Defiant such as Pawniard and Purugly, as they will gain an Attack boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Tangela and Quilladin make for good partners for Arbok, as they can take on the Ground-types that plague it such as Golem and Stunfisk. Arbok also appreciates Pokemon such as Metang that can take on Psychic-types such as Grumpig and Mr. Mime. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Floatzel are able to weaken a lot of Arbok's checks, making it easier for Arbok to sweep; additionally, Stoutland is able to trap Misdreavus with Pursuit. Pokemon such as Monferno and Dodrio that struggle with Stunfisk appreciate Arbok's ability to lure it in and deal with it thanks to Shuca Berry. Because Arbok is somewhat slow, Leavanny can be a great partner, providing Sticky Web to slow down faster foes such as Floatzel.</p>"

  "Farfetchâ€™d": {
    "overview": "<p>Farfetch'd is a horrible Pokemon, being one of the worst fully evolved ones in the PU metagame due to its low Speed, Attack, and bulk. As an attacker, it is outclassed by Dodrio, which hits much harder, and as a sweeper, it is outclassed by Jumpluff, which is much faster and can put its foes to sleep with Sleep Powder. Purugly outclasses it as a Defiant user, as it has access to Fake Out, is much faster, and is much stronger. Despite all of Farfetch'd's flaws, it is at least able to boost its Attack by two stages with Defiant or Swords Dance and pick off weakened Pokemon with Quick Attack. It also has access to Leaf Blade, which allows it to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB type combination, such as Golem.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Farfetch'd doesn't have many other options to choose from, but it can use Knock Off, which allows it to take on Ghost-types such as Misdreavus without taking recoil while also removing Eviolites. Agility can be used in place of Swords Dance to boost Farfetch'd's Speed, while Tailwind can do the same in addition to supporting Farfetch'd's team; nevertheless, Swords Dance is generally better, as Farfetch'd is very weak. Roost can be used to boost Farfetch'd's longevity, but Farfetch'd usually isn't able to take hits anyway. Return gives Farfetch'd an option for a stronger Normal-type STAB attack, but it is a lot less useful than Brave Bird. U-turn can be helpful to get chip damage on Pokemon such as Probopass and grant momentum, but it is a lot less helpful than Quick Attack. Sharp Beak, while only boosting the power of Brave Bird, can be used to avoid recoil from Life Orb and is often more reliable than Stick. A Jolly nature can be used instead of Adamant, but it only helps Farfetch'd outspeed a few Pokemon and makes it lose out on a lot of power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Probopass and Solrock can comfortably take Farfetch'd's STAB moves and take advantage of it by setting up Stealth Rock; however, Farfetch'd can deal decent damage to Solrock with Leaf Blade.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Stunfisk, Zebstrika, and Raichu can take any hit from Farfetch'd, and other than Stunfisk, all of them can outspeed and OHKO it with their respective STAB moves. Stunfisk can also take advantage of Farfetch'd by setting up Stealth Rock, while Zebstrika and Raichu can use Volt Switch to gain momentum on an incoming switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Because Farfetch'd is so frail, almost anything faster than it can OHKO or 2HKO it, while Farfetch'd can only manage to get off chip damage with Quick Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Farfetch'd doesn't find many opportunities to set up, Swords Dance can double its Attack, allowing it to deal much more damage to its foes. Brave Bird is Farfetch'd's strongest STAB move, and it can deal a lot of damage to frailer foes, but the recoil cuts Farfetch'd's health. Leaf Blade allows Farfetch'd to threaten Pokemon that resist Brave Bird, such as Probopass and Stunfisk, while also sporting a very high critical hit chance thanks to Stick. Quick Attack allows Farfetch'd to pick off weakened foes, especially after an Attack boost from Swords Dance or Defiant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread aims to maximize Farfetch'd's offensive capabilities. An Adamant nature along with maximum Attack investment gives Farfetch'd the power to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment is helpful in order to outspeed Pokemon such as Roselia. Farfetch'd can discourage the use of Defog thanks to Defiant, which gives it a +2 Attack boost if it switches into Defog. Stick is an item exclusive to Farfetch'd that boosts its critical hit ratio, giving moves such as Leaf Blade a very high chance for a critical hit. Life Orb can also be used to reliably deal more damage, but it easily wears down Farfetch'd and comes at the cost of its high critical hit ratio.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Farfetch'd is extremely frail, so it shouldn't be switched into strong attacks from Pokemon such as Stoutland and Monferno. Instead, it should be safely brought into battle with the help of a slower Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Pelipper. Farfetch'd can be switched into Defoggers such as Pelipper and Vibrava to gain a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant, but it should be wary of taking a hit instead. If a foe is low on health, Farfetch'd can be brought in to revenge kill it with Quick Attack. If Farfetch'd is facing a foe that can't deal much damage to it, such as Gogoat, it can set up a Swords Dance in order to sweep or punch a hole in the opposing team. Farfetch'd should mainly be used as a late-game sweeper, though it can also be brought in mid-game to gain a boost from Defog or revenge kill a foe with Quick Attack; it can also set up on a forced switch against foes such as Roselia and Vibrava.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Farfetch'd best fits on offensive teams, mainly ones that make use of a lot of entry hazards, as it can discourage the use of Defog and sweep late-game. Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes from Pokemon such as Bronzor and Roselia are helpful to wear down Farfetch'd's checks, as well as break opposing Sturdy and Focus Sash. Sticky Web users such as Smeargle and Kricketune work wonders for Farfetch'd, as Sticky Web can slow down the foe, helping Farfetch'd outspeed faster Pokemon such as Ninetales and Simipour; all entry hazards are also helpful for baiting the use of Defog, which gives Farfetch'd a +2 Attack boost. Farfetch'd appreciates wallbreakers such as Ursaring and Stoutland, as they can weaken Farfetch'd's checks, making it easier to sweep. Slow users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Probopass and Pelipper, make for good partners, as they can get Farfetch'd into battle safely. Probopass is also able to trap opposing Probopass, which would otherwise wall Farfetch'd. Ground-types such as Golem and Gabite are able to take on Electric- and Rock-types, which are some of the most common Pokemon Farfetch'd is weak to. Because Farfetch'd is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Pelipper and Armaldo. Healing Wish support from Pokemon such as Clefairy and Mr. Mime is very helpful in reviving Farfetch'd for the late-game, as it can be quickly worn down by Stealth Rock damage as well as recoil from Brave Bird.</p>"

Although Dodrio is outsped by many offensive Pokemon such as Simipour, Floatzel, and Zebstrika, it is still able to outspeed common Pokemon such as Monferno and Grumpig. However, Dodrio's Stealth Rock weakness combined with Brave Bird recoil wears it down very quickly. Dodrio also faces competition with Ursaring and Stoutland as a wallbreaker but has the advantage of two powerful STAB moves, access to Knock Off, and a priority move in Quick Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Natural Gift with Apicot or Salac Berry gives Dodrio a 100 Power Ground- or Fighting-type move, respectively, to deal with Probopass, its most common switch-in; Natural Gift with Liechi Berry is also usable, as it gives Dodrio a powerful Grass-type move to hit Relicanth and Golem. Toxic can deal with bulkier Pokemon such as Vullaby and Relicanth but is horrible to be Choice-locked into.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist both of Dodrio's STAB moves and don't take much damage from Knock Off. Also, Klang and Pawniard can use Dodrio as setup fodder while Probopass can freely set up Stealth Rock on it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist both of Dodrio's STAB moves and can hit back with their super effective STAB moves. Supportive Rock-types such as Golem and Probopass can set up Stealth Rock on Dodrio. Defensive Relicanth can also set up Stealth Rock, while offensive Relicanth can use Dodrio as setup fodder for Rock Polish.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Floatzel, Electrode, and Simisear can easily outspeed and KO Choice Band or Life Orb Dodrio with their STAB moves. Priority users and faster Choice Scarf users, such as Pawniard and Rotom-F, can KO Choice Scarf Dodrio.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: The recoil from Brave Bird as well as its weakness to Stealth Rock can quickly wear Dodrio down, especially if it is burned or poisoned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Dodrio's primary STAB move because of its incredible power. However, when the extra power is not needed or the recoil is not desired, Return is a good STAB option. Knock Off cripples Pokemon that depend on their items as well as Rock- and Steel-types that may try to switch in to Dodrio's STAB moves, such as Misdreavus and Probopass, respectively. Quick Attack is a priority STAB move that allows Dodrio to finish off weakened Pokemon that are faster than it such as Simisear, Raichu, and Zebstrika. Alternatively, Pursuit can be used instead to trap and KO weakened Pokemon or to heavily damage Pokemon that usually switch out of Dodrio such as Roselia.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs are used to maximize Dodrio's Speed and damage output. A Jolly nature lets it outspeed Pokemon such as Basculin and Leafeon and Speed tie with Pokemon such as Ninetales. Early Bird makes dealing with Jumpluff and other Sleep Powder users such as Roselia a little easier. Choice Band gives Dodrio more power to wallbreak, while Life Orb lets Dodrio switch moves but wears it down even more quickly than usual and provides a smaller power boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dodrio works best as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker. To avoid getting KOed, Dodrio should only be switched in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a teammate has been KOed. Knock Off should only be used to cripple defensive switch-ins that Dodrio has a hard time KOing, such as Metang and Klang. Otherwise, Brave Bird and Return should be used most frequently.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks and counters to Steel-types, such as Monferno and Stunfisk, allow Dodrio to freely use its STAB moves to wallbreak. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Probopass and Vibrava can help Dodrio switch in safely, as can defoggers such as Swanna and Vullaby. Probopass can trap and KO Steel-types for Dodrio; Probopass also provides a slow Volt Switch. Sweepers and cleaners such as Huntail and Choice Scarf Rotom-F appreciate Dodrio weakening the opponent's team, allowing them to do their jobs more easily. Water- and Grass-types such as Simipour and Simisage can get rid of Rock-types, while Dodrio can get rid of Grass-types for them in return. Similarly, Fighting-types such as Monferno deal with Steel-, Ice-, and Rock-types, while Ground-types can deal with Steel-, Rock- and Electric-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a powerful STAB move that does not inflict recoil damage. Brave Bird is Dodrio's strongest STAB move on this set, but it comes with the price of recoil damage. Knock Off cripples Pokemon that are dependent on their items such as Misdreavus and Clefairy while also crippling Rock- and Steel-type switch-ins. Pursuit can be used to KO a weakened foe that tries to switch out of Dodrio or to weaken Pokemon that Dodrio forces out, such as Roselia. Quick Attack can be used to KO faster, weakened Choice Scarf or priority users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs with a Jolly nature give Dodrio a good amount of power and let it outspeed the whole unboosted tier as well as common Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime, Rotom-F, and Leafeon. An Adamant nature is an option for a decent boost in power in exchange for being outspeed by those Choice Scarf users. Early Bird makes dealing with Sleep Powder users easier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dodrio will mostly be used as a revenge killer throughout the game, so it should only be switched in after a teammate has been KOed. Late-game, Dodrio can clean up weakened teams. Because of its low bulk, weakness to Stealth Rock, and heavy recoil damage from Brave Bird, Dodrio should not switch in unless it can OHKO the foe. Keeping Dodrio healthy is crucial throughout the game to make sure that it can safely revenge kill and clean late-game when the foe is weakened. Brave Bird or Return should always be used to revenge kill, but Knock Off or Pursuit can be used on predicted switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting- and Ground-types, such as Combusken and Stunfisk, have good synergy with Dodrio, with the former dealing with Rock-, Steel-, and Ice-types and the latter dealing with Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types. Probopass can trap Steel-types for Dodrio so that it doesn't have to worry about them switching in when revenge killing. Water-types, such as Simipour and Floatzel, and Grass-types, such as Jumpluff and Tangela, can also deal with Rock-types for Dodrio; in return, Dodrio can take care of the Grass-types that resist their STAB moves. Also, entry hazard control is very important to ensure that Dodrio can revenge kill foes without having to take residual damage.</p>"

  "Electrode": {
    "overview": "<p>Electrode is the second fastest unboosted Pokemon in PU, after Ninjask, meaning it can revenge kill most of the tier while still holding a power-boosting item. While Zebstrika is more often the superior choice, the two have different movepools and niches, with Zebstrika being immune to Grass- or Electric-type moves, depending on its choice of ability, and Electrode being immune to sound-based moves, which makes it a check to Chatot. Zebstrika can hit Grass-types back with Overheat, while Electrode is stronger because it is able to run a Modest nature over Timid most of the time. Electrode is also able to safely revenge kill opposing weakened Zebstrika, whereas Zebstrika has to risk a Speed tie in mirror matchups. Electrode also makes for a fast rain lead with a perfectly accurate Thunder. Its access to Taunt further allows it to perform as an anti-lead by stopping Sticky Web and Spikes, but it must watch out for other common leads that carry Earthquake. Aside from that, Electrode has a shallow movepool that doesn't allow it to beat common Pokemon that can OHKO it or set up on it. It, like Zebstrika, is hindered by the fact that it is walled by Stunfisk, one of the most common Pokemon in PU. Finally, Electrode's lackluster bulk means it is OHKOed by a plethora of setup sweepers, priority users, and pretty much every foe with a strong Ground-type move like Earthquake or Earth Power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electrode has a very shallow movepool that doesn't give it many other options. Toxic might be a cool option for crippling foes right before Electrode faints and is particularly useful against Stunfisk, which is Electrode's biggest counter; however, Electrode doesn't have the room for this on any of its sets. Thunder Wave can be used mostly to cripple Pokemon that might be threatening to your team, especially Rapidash and Regice. Magic Coat can help to bounce back entry hazards and status that may be coming Electrode's way, but once again, Electrode doesn't have a moveslot to give up for this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Volt Switch, which means their mere presence hinders Electrode quite a bit. Stunfisk and Camerupt are easily the biggest counters, taking very little from Hidden Power Ice. Other Ground-types such as Golem also check Electrode, but they take a decent amount from Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Due to their good special bulk, Pokemon like Clefairy and Audino can shrug off any of Electrode's attacks and take advantage of it. However, they lack an immunity to Volt Switch, which means Electrode can simply pivot out of them.</p> <p><strong>Other Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: Seaking works as a good specialized counter to Electrode thanks to Lightning Rod. Raichu and Zebstrika can also carry Lightning Rod. Though they cannot switch into Electrode, as they are 2HKOed by Signal Beam with a bit of prior damage, they can usually beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Gogoat, Roselia, and the Gourgeist formes can take Electrode's STAB attacks and spread Leech Seed or hit it with Giga Drain. However, they have to beware of Hidden Power Ice or Signal Beam in Gogoat's case.</p> <p><strong>Priority and Choice Scarf Pokemon</strong>: Although Electrode is very fast, it gets outsped by almost every Choice Scarf user. They can threaten Electrode with a hard-hitting move, exploiting its low bulk. Priority also threatens Electrode, examples being Monferno's Mach Punch and Pawniard's Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt doesn't force Electrode to switch out and is a bit stronger than Volt Switch, which is used to gain momentum while still doing a lot of damage. Hidden Power Ice provides coverage against Grass-types like Roselia and Tangela; it also 2HKOes Vibrava, Fraxure, and Gabite and OHKOes Jumpluff. Signal Beam provides coverage against Psychic-types like Grumpig. If running Life Orb, Taunt can be used to stop bulkier Pokemon like Roselia, Regice, Duosion, and Clefairy from setting up hazards or boosting against Electrode.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb boosts Electrode's damage output and allows it to change moves. Alternatively, Choice Specs allows Electrode to hit a lot harder and without recoil in exchange for the ability to switch moves. Soundproof allows Electrode to not get revenge killed by Choice Scarf Chatot's Boomburst, as well as to act as a reliable check to it. However, if your team has answers to Chatot, Aftermath can be used instead. The given EV spread allows Electrode to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier outside of Ninjask, as well as beating out +2 Adamant Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electrode's main purpose is to act as a revenge killer, as it can outspeed almost everything and has pretty good coverage. However, it must be wary of other revenge killers with Choice Scarf and priority users. Due to Electrode's low bulk, it should never come in on strong attacks like Stoutland's Return. Electrode only has one truly safe switch in, and that is Chatot Choice-locked into Boomburst. However, it can still come in on weak attacks like Tangela's Giga Drain if necessary. Try not to let the opponent take advantage of Electrode if using Choice Specs. Make double switches if you think your opponent will go into a Lightning Rod Pokemon or a Ground-type. Volt Switch should be used most of the time, unless Thunderbolt is needed to KO the Pokemon in front of Electrode. If Electrode is cleaning late-game, it should use Thunderbolt, as it has the highest damage output.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Floatzel and Basculin, which can remove Ground-types so Electrode can use its STAB moves safely, are good teammates. Pokemon that can take advantage of Stunfisk specifically are also good partners. Examples include Roselia and Clefairy. Electrode struggles to KO Grass-types even though it has Hidden Power Ice, so Pokemon that can remove them or use them as setup fodder like Bouffalant, Dodrio, and Simisear are good teammates. Slow U-turn users like Vibrava and Probopass can take a hit for Electrode and bring it in safely, while faster U-turn and Volt Switch users, particularly Ninjask, can form an offensive VoltTurn core with it. Entry hazard setters like Roselia and Metang can help to get extra chip damage combined with Electrode's Volt Switches. Wallbreakers that can get rid of specially defensive walls or tanks like Choice Specs Mr. Mime can help pave the way for Electrode to clean up. Offensive Fire-types like Monferno and Rapidash appreciate having Water-types gone. Monferno also benefits from Electrode dealing with Flying-types.</p>"

      "Rain Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance allows Electrode to support its teammates by activating Swift Swim, making Water-type moves stronger and making Hurricane and Thunder hit 100% of the time. Taunt can stop Pokemon like Quilladin and Gabite from setting entry hazards or inflicting status. Thunder is used because Rain Dance makes it 100% accurate, and it gives Electrode a stronger attack than Thunderbolt. Explosion is used to bring in another Pokemon as fast as possible while almost always doing a lot of damage. Volt Switch can be used if Electrode hasn't already fainted to switch to a teammate, and thanks to Electrode's Speed, it should almost always go first.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Damp Rock enhances the number of rain turns, making it easier to take advantage of. Soundproof gives Electrode a safe switch in against Choice-locked Chatot. The Speed EVs allow Electrode to outspeed Zebstrika by one point. 252 HP EVs go into helping Electrode take a hit, as it doesn't have the best bulk. The rest goes into Special Attack to help it deal a bit more damage. The EV spread 252 HP / 120 SpA / 136 Spe can be used to outspeed Jolly Fraxure after it uses Dragon Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electrode plays the role of a dedicated rain lead thanks to its speed and ability to pivot out as quickly as possible, allowing teammates to get the maximum number of rain turns available. Electrode's priority is to set up rain as soon as possible; the only time it shouldn't use Rain Dance is when against another lead such as Venipede, Smeargle, or Quilladin. Electrode should not Taunt Pokemon such as Golem and Metang, as they will OHKO it, preventing it from setting rain; it should only Taunt leads that cannot OHKO it. Electrode should not stay in after setting up Rain Dance unless it is against a Water-type that doesn't have Swift Swim; this is to preserve as many turns as possible for stronger teammates to take advantage of the rain. Electrode is an expendable member as long as it can get rain up in most situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electrode should only be used on rain teams with Pokemon that gain from its support. Rain abusers such as Golduck, Floatzel, Armaldo, and Beartic get the extra Speed boost from Swift Swim as well as a buff to their Water-type moves. Pokemon such as Swanna and Articuno get to spam perfectly accurate Hurricane under rain and can remove Ground-types for Electrode and Grass-types for the Water-type sweepers. Electric-types like Rotom-F and Raichu gain perfectly accurate Thunder while in rain; they can also remove opposing Water-types that may try to take advantage of the rain. Electrode cannot single-handedly support a rain team, so another rain setter, ideally Volbeat, is needed for a proper rain team.</p>"

However, Noctowl lacks both a 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks and reliance on Eviolite for bulk, unlike Pelipper and Vullaby, respectively. Noctowl has a niche in Insomnia, which allows it to safely switch into users of sleep-inducing moves such as Jumpluff. Noctowl also has nice HP and Special Defense stats, allowing it to check special attackers, such as Simipour and Mr. Mime. However, Noctowl's Flying typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock, and its low Defense makes it vulnerable to physical attackers, such as Stoutland and Leafeon. Because Noctowl is passive, it is easily taken advantage of as fodder for setup sweepers, such as Clefairy and Pawniard, and crippled by Taunt users, such as Misdreavus and Grumpig.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Noctowl could run a Tailwind set to let slow wallbreakers, such as Golem and Marowak, outspeed their threats. Whirlwind prevents Noctowl from being setup fodder for setup sweepers such as Ninetales. Noctowl could run Magic Coat to bounce back status moves, such as Taunt, but it is unreliable. Noctowl could run a Tinted Lens attacking set, but it is outclassed by the likes of Chatot. Thunder Wave could be used over Toxic, but Toxic is preferred due to Noctowl's passive nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu easily outspeed and can 2HKO Noctowl, forcing it to use Roost more frequently. However, they dislike getting hit with a Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types, such as Golem and Relicanth, can easily OHKO Noctowl with their Rock-type STAB moves. However, they must watch out for Toxic on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Pawniard and Klang are immune to Toxic,and can use Noctowl as set up fodder. Pawniard in particular has Defiant, allowing it to switch into a predicted Defog and set up to +2.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard Users</strong>: Magic Guard users, such as Clefairy and Duosion, don't take any damage from poison. Because Noctowl relies on Toxic damage, they can set up a Calm Mind on it and make it setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Status conditions, such as burn, poison, and paralysis combined with Stealth Rock damage can wear down Noctowl quickly, forcing it to frequently use Roost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users, such as Misdreavus and Grumpig, can outspeed cripple Noctowl and cripple it with Taunt, forcing it to use Night Shade or switch out. The former can use the opportunity to set up with Nasty Plot and the latter can cure its team of status with Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, such as Ursaring and Stoutland, can take advantage of Noctowl's low Defense and KO it. Both of them do not mind a Toxic, as they can use it to their advantage for a more powerful Facade.</p>",

      "Defensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost provides reliable recovery and allows Noctowl to stay healthy throughout the match. Defog allows Noctowl to remove entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, allowing teammates to switch in more. Toxic hits defensive walls that Noctowl is otherwise unable to touch, such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, and Normal-types, which are immune to Night Shade, such as Stoutland. Night Shade is Noctowl's only attack, and has fixed damage. Alternatively, Noctowl could run Hidden Power Fighting in the fourth slot to hit Steel-types, such as Probopass and Pawniard, or Air Slash to hit Grass- and Fighting-types, such as Jumpluff and Monferno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD and a Calm nature maximize Noctowl's Special Defense and allow it to take hits from special attackers such as Simipour and Mr. Mime and take minimum damage from Stealth Rock. Insomnia allows Noctowl to check sleep users such as Jumpluff. Leftovers adds to Noctowl's recovery and aids it in staying healthy during the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Noctowl should use Defog to remove entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, but it should be wary of Defiant users, such as Pawniard, as they can gain a +2 Attack boost from switching into Defog. Noctowl should Roost frequently in order to keep its health up. Noctowl should focus on using Toxic early-game to wear down foes. Switch Noctowl into special attackers that can't much to Noctowl, such as Simipour, but try not to switch it into physical attacks, due to its low Defense. Status conditions such as burn, paralysis, and poison cause Noctowl to be worn down quickly when combined with Stealth Rock damage, so don't switch it into status users, such as Misdreavus and Grumpig. Use Night Shade to rack up more damage combined with Toxic damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Noctowl fits best on balanced or stall teams because of its passive nature. A physically bulky Pokemon such as Tangela or Bronzor is recommended to take on wallbreakers that will attempt to abuse Noctowl, such as Stoutland. Ground-types, such as Stunfisk and Golem, are able to take Electric- and Rock-type attacks for Noctowl, while it provides Defog support and deals with Grass-types. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, such as Rotom-F, Dodrio, and Rapidash, benefit from Noctowl's ability to remove entry hazards and can take down threats to Noctowl. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Probopass is also beneficial to help Noctowl wear down its does. Pokemon such as Pawniard make for good partners because they can deal with Magic Guard users, which Noctowl is unable to touch.</p>"

  "Ariados": {
    "overview": "<p>Ariados is a rather outclassed Pokemon in PU. While it does have a niche in having access to both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, there are better users of Sticky Web, mainly Smeargle and Leavanny, and Toxic Spikes aren't always worthwhile. While this entry hazard combination makes Ariados seem like an amazing lead for offensive teams, it has quite a few things holding it back. Firstly, Ariados is incredibly slow, especially for a lead, making it complete Taunt bait and easy to KO. Not only is Ariados incredibly prone to being Taunted, but it also can't do much damage at all to any Taunt users. Ariados's vulnerability to Taunt aside, it is still hard to set up both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes against most teams. Finally, Ariados absolutely needs its Focus Sash to be effective, requiring team support to function effectively when not leading.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ariados doesn't really have many other viable options, especially because its only real niche is having access to both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes; however, it has a few niche moves it can use. A weather support set with Sunny Day could be used, but it is very outclassed by other sun setters. Also, Night Shade can be used to deal decent damage to Steel- and Ghost-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Rapid Spin users, such as Avalugg and Armaldo, can spin away Ariados's entry hazards with ease. Avalugg takes very little damage from Megahorn and can 2HKO Ariados with Avalanche or spin away entry hazards. Also, Defog users, such as Vullaby and Swanna, can clear away Ariados's entry hazards with ease.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types take almost no damage from Megahorn and can set up Stealth Rock and phaze Ariados out. Most notably, Golem takes very little damage from either of Ariados's attacks and can KO it with Rock Blast, especially in a lead matchup.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist Ariados's STAB moves and can basically do whatever they want. For example, Arbok can set up Coil with ease. Grounded Poison-types also absorb the Toxic Spikes that Ariados sets.</p> <p><strong>Defiant Users</strong>: Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly can easily 2HKO Ariados; Pawniard can set up Swords Dance on Ariados while Purugly can KO it with Life Orb-boosted Fake Out + Return. In addition, they receive a +2 Attack boost from switching into Sticky Web, allowing them to cause heavy damage to the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Faster users of Taunt such as Misdreavus and Glalie can stop Ariados in its tracks, forcing it to use its relatively weak attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Sticky Web is on the opponent's side of the field, the Speed of a foe switching in is lowered by one stage, allowing your powerful wallbreakers to become threatening sweepers. Toxic Spikes wears down foes very quickly, especially those on offensive teams holding a Life Orb, and cripples walls, making them easier to KO. Ariados's STAB Megahorn hits fairly hard, despite its mediocre base 90 Attack, and keeps it from being complete Taunt bait for the likes of Misdreavus and Floatzel. Sucker Punch is the best option in the last moveslot due to its priority.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash is required on the set, as it allows Ariados to set up at least one layer of entry hazards if it isn't Taunted first. Maximum Speed and Attack investment allow Ariados to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, including Adamant Golem and Marowak, and deal as much damage to foes as possible. Insomnia is helpful to prevent Ariados from being put to sleep by the occasional Sleep Powder or Hypnosis. However, Swarm can be used because sleep-inducing moves are relatively uncommon in PU, and Megahorn hits rather hard when Ariados is brought down to its Focus Sash, as it is boosted by Swarm.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ariados should be used to set up Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes early-game and is best used as a suicide lead. Only if the opponent has an entry hazard remover or a Taunt-using lead such as Monferno or Glalie should you not lead with Ariados. If your opponent has a more offensively inclined team, set up Sticky Web and at least one layer of Toxic Spikes if possible, but try to set up two layers of Toxic Spikes against more defensive and stall teams. Ariados should be attacking only if it is given a free turn or neither entry hazard helps your team much, so take advantage of Team Preview as much as possible. Also, be wary of opposing grounded Poison-types, as they can remove Toxic Spikes by switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong, slow wallbreakers such as Stoutland, Lapras, and Marowak make good partners for Ariados, as they appreciate Sticky Web. Pokemon that can pressure grounded Poison-types also make for good partners, as they can keep these Pokemon from switching in and instantly removing Toxic Spikes. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL make for decent teammates for their ability to keep foes from using Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Pawniard makes for a good partner thanks to its ability to deter opposing Defoggers through Defiant. Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika pressure opposing Flying-types, which are immune to Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes and can carry Defog to remove entry hazards. Fast attackers such as Jumpluff and Floatzel are helpful in case Sticky Web is removed or not set up in the first place.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Magcargo is outclassed as an offensive Fire-type by Rapidash, Simisear, and Ninetales due to its poor attacking stats and Speed, as well as being outclassed defensively by Torkoal, which lacks recovery but has a better typing and access to Rapid Spin. Magcargo is also outclassed as a specially offensive Rock-type by Lunatone, due to its below average Speed and Special Attack, and as a defensive Rock-type by Probopass, because of its weakness to residual damage. Magcargo does have access to a great supportive movepool including moves such as Memento, Reflect, Light Screen, Stealth Rock, as well as reliable recovery by virtue of Recover. However, its Fire / Rock typing is very detrimental, as it provides two 4x weaknesses, to Water and Ground, as well as a weakness to Stealth Rock, which can make Magcargo easy to pressure. Magcargo's dismal Speed leaves it as an open target for Taunt users such as Misdreavus. Magcargo also has a bad matchup against opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Stunfisk due to its overall mediocrity, and it doesn't deserve a team slot over any of them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magcargo gets access to dual screens, which could be used with Light Clay, as well as Memento; both can be used to create opportunities for other teammates to set up, although Magcargo is outclassed by Meowstic-M and Solrock in this regard. Earth Power can be used to hit Fire-types as hard as Ancient Power does, as well as Rock-types such as Probopass and Relicanth. A defensive spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to check physical attackers better, although Magcargo is generally better at taking on specially attacking Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp can be used to punish physical attackers more reliably, although with the good chance of getting off a burn with Lava Plume, Toxic is still preferred to take on walls. An offensive Shell Smash set with maximum Special Attack and Speed paired with a Timid nature can be used, utilizing the moves Ancient Power / Fire Blast / Earth Power / Shell Smash, although it's usually too slow to pull it off well and is outclassed by Torkoal. Yawn is an option to pressure setup sweepers or incoming threats, as well as entry hazard removers, although Magcargo doesn't generally have a moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Pelipper, Relicanth, and Floatzel can switch in on Magcargo's STAB attacks, although they have to watch out for a burn from Lava Plume or a Toxic; however, Floatzel isn't at risk of getting burned due to Water Veil.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Golem can switch in relatively freely against Magcargo, bar a burn, and either force Magcargo out with the threat of Earthquake, set up Stealth Rock against it, or OHKO it with Earthquake. Stunfisk can take a hit and can deal major damage to Magcargo with Earth Power, although Toxic can pressure it and limit its ability to switch into attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Grumpig and Misdreavus prevent Magcargo from using Recover, Stealth Rock, and Toxic, limiting it to using its weak attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from entry hazards and Toxic severely limits Magcargo's ability to switch into attacks or stay on the field for a long period of time.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Clefairy and Duosion can come in for free against Magcargo, as they don't care about getting status inflicted onto them due to Magic Guard and can use it for setup fodder. Kadabra can fulfill this role as well, but it wouldn't appreciate its Focus Sash getting broken if it's using one.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Monferno is a solid switch-in to Magcargo, as it cannot be burned by Lava Plume and takes little to no damage from any of Magcargo's moves.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears down foes switching in while also breaking their Sturdy and Focus Sash. Lava Plume gains a STAB boost and provides a chance to burn a foe, which can allow Magcargo to take on physical attackers and walls better. Toxic hits common checks and counters to Magcargo on the switch in, such as Pelipper, Vibrava, and Politoed, to name a few. Toxic can also be used to hit special walls such as Audino and Grumpig. Ancient Power is an option to hit Fire- and Flying-types such as Rapidash and Dodrio as well as Pokemon such as Swanna on the switch. Recover restores Magcargo's HP and allows it to withstand offensive pressure throughout a match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP investment maximizes Magcargo's bulk while minimizing residual damage. The HP investment paired with maximum Special Defense investment and a Calm nature allows Magcargo to avoid being 2HKOed by Zebstrika with any combination of moves. Flame Body can punish attackers using contact moves and further goes to assist Magcargo in taking on physical attackers. Leftovers offers Magcargo a bit of residual recovery per turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magcargo is not usually considered a lead, although it's a smart idea to set up Stealth Rock early-game. While using Magcargo, be wary of super effective coverage moves such as Superpower on Stoutland and Focus Blast on Regice. Magcargo should also be aware of status absorbers like Ursaring, and Flash Fire users such as Rapidash and Ninetales. When predicting an opponent to switch to Ninetales, Rapidash, or Pelipper, use Ancient Power. Use Toxic and Lava Plume to spread status around the opposing team and weaken it for Magcargo's teammates. Be wary of Taunt users, as Magcargo is slow, and Taunt can prevent it from using Toxic and Stealth Rock; Magcargo should also stay clear of opposing Toxic and Stealth Rock, as they can wear it down quickly. Magcargo should mostly be used to check special attackers such as Rotom-F, but it can also check physical attackers such as Dodrio because of its high Defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magcargo fits mostly on bulkier offensive teams or balanced ones, as it is completely outclassed by Golem on hyper offense. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Roselia and Quilladin can help wear down foes more easily and keep pressure on the opposing team. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL are good to keep your entry hazards on the field, while Purugly and Pawniard can be used to discourage Defog due to Defiant. Setup sweepers and wallbreakers that appreciate Stealth Rock such as Ursaring, Jumpluff, and Fraxure are solid teammates for Magcargo. Leafeon, Roselia, and other Grass-types can handle the Ground- and Water-type attacks Magcargo struggles with, although the latter can't switch into physical Ground-types reliably. Jumpluff has solid type synergy with Magcargo, so they can take hits for each other, bar Rock-type attacks. Pokemon such as Politoed and Pelipper can reliably switch into Water-type moves as well, although they have to be wary of coverage moves. Entry hazard removal can help with Magcargo's Stealth Rock weakness, with Rapid Spin users being preferred, as they don't remove Magcargo's entry hazards. Clerics such as Lickilicky, Grumpig, and Audino can cure Toxic, which can be very harmful against Magcargo. A teammate to take on Clefairy and Duosion, such as Metang or Misdreavus, is essential, as they can use Magcargo as setup fodder.</p>"

Despite its small niche in its reliable recovery, Corsola doesn't have the sheer defenses needed for that to matter. Corsola's poor offensive stats prevent it from being a prominent attacker, mean that it is walled by Grass-types and opposing bulky Water-types, and make it only useful on defensive teams. Corsola's defensive typing can hold it back, as it is weak to common types in the metagame such as Fighting, Grass, Electric, and Ground, and it easily falls prey to coverage moves. Regenerator enables Corsola to become a pivot, although Tangela is better at this job.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set with Calm Mind / Power Gem / Scald / filler could be used, but it has little over other setup sweepers, such as Simipour and Huntail. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back status moves and entry hazards, but it requires prediction and takes up a valuable moveslot. Power Gem can be used instead of Toxic, but it isn't as effective and almost guarantees Corsola would lose to setup sweepers. Mirror Coat could surprise special attackers, although Corsola isn't bulky enough to pull it off effectively. Ice Beam can be used to better take on Grass-types, although Corsola lacks offensive presence. Corsola can run a Choice Band set in combination with Hustle, but this set doesn't have a reason to be used over Relicanth and has a chance to miss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Roselia, Tangela, Jumpluff, Sawsbuck, Leafeon, Simisage, and other Grass-types can easily take out Corsola with their Grass-type STAB moves and take little to no damage from Scald, although they can be crippled if burned. Roselia is a perfect counter to Corsola, as it resists Scald and is not affected by Toxic, and it can even set up Spikes against it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-F, Raichu, Zebstrika, and Electabuzz can take advantage of Corsola, dealing massive damage with their Electric-type STAB moves as well as gaining momentum with Volt Switch. However, they fear getting burned or poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Corsola's only passable defensive stats, it takes huge amounts of damage from physically attacking Grass-types such as Jumpluff and Leafeon, Electric-types such as Luxray, and even Pokemon with neutral attacks, such as Rampardos.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Rapidash, Monferno, Stoutland, and Ursaring can threaten Corsola with their coverage moves, with Rapidash using Drill Run or Wild Charge, Stoutland using Superpower, and Ursaring using Close Combat.</p>",

Recover allows Corsola to regain its health and can help it stall foes until they are KOed by Toxic or another status condition. Scald is Corsola's only attacking option and offers chip damage and the potential to burn a foe, which can stop physical attackers in their tracks. Toxic weakens foes to the point where Corsola can stall them out or a teammate can come in to take them out. Toxic is also beneficial to take on Grass- and Water-types that try to switch in against Corsola.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs allow Corsola to function as a specially defensive wall and better take on special attackers such as Floatzel and Kadabra. Leftovers offers a bit of recovery per turn, which can be important when paired with Recover. Regenerator restores Corsola's health as it switches out, allowing it to come back onto the field with more HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Corsola is on the field with low HP and you need to save it to take on a threatening Pokemon, switch it out if possible to allow for a Regenerator boost. Just because this Corsola set uses Stealth Rock doesn't mean that you always have to use it as your lead, although setting up Stealth Rock is its primary objective. If needed, before Corsola sets up Stealth Rock, it can opt to go for Toxic or Scald against a setup sweeper or when you predict a threatening or bulky Pokemon to switch in. After it sets up its entry hazard, Corsola should attempt to weaken the opposing team with Scald and Toxic. Attempt not to get Corsola statused, as it can get weakened fairly easily when afflicted with Toxic or a burn. Corsola can switch into threatening Pokemon in the metagame such as Kadabra, Floatzel, and Simipour.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Corsola fits best on defensive teams, as it lacks an offensive presence and needs teammates to support it, in taking on status and super effective hits. Grass-types such as Gogoat, Roselia, Gourgeist-XL, and Tangela assist Corsola by resisting Electric-, Ground-, and Grass-type moves, while Corsola resists Fire- and Ice-type moves for them. Electric-types such as Stunfisk and Rotom-F can take on Electric-type moves for Corsola, although they share a weakness to Ground-type moves, bar Rotom-F. Rotom-F can also damage Grass- and Ground-types with Blizzard. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL can take on Ground- and Fighting-types, which threaten Corsola. Flying- and Fire-types such as Jumpluff, Dodrio, Ninetales, and Simisear can take on Grass-types for Corsola. Rest users such as Zweilous and Munchlax can absorb status for Corsola and allow it to survive longer, although Munchlax and Zweilous have to be running a RestTalk set to do so. Similarly, clerics such as Grumpig and Audino can heal off Corsola's status. Setup sweepers such as Duosion, Clefairy, and Klang appreciate Corsola's entry hazards, which weakens the opposing team. Quilladin and Roselia can set up Spikes, which work well in conjunction with Stealth Rock in weakening foes. Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL can block foes from removing Corsola's Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, while Pokemon such as Grumpig and Zweilous appreciate entry hazards and status from Corsola, as they can force a switch with Whirlwind and Dragon Tail, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Pelipper's decent physical bulk and access to Roost make it a good check to many physical attackers in the tier like physical Floatzel, Monferno, and Pawniard. Pelipper is also a decently reliable entry hazard remover, with its access to Defog and reliable recovery in Roost. A decent defensive typing in Water / Flying lets Pelipper resist Water- and Fire-type moves, some of the more common types in the metagame. Pelipper faces competition from other Defog users, such as Swanna, Lumineon, Vullaby, and Prinplup. However, due to Pelipper's bulk, ability to be a better Monferno check, and reliable recovery, it differentiates itself from these other Pokemon. Unfortunately, Pelipper is easily worn down by status and Stealth Rock, the latter of which it is weak to. This pressures it to go for Roost instead of Defog. It is also very passive, so setup sweepers can set up on it fairly easily. In addition, Pelipper is also easily pressured, which makes its weakness to Stealth Rock worse because it is forced to switch out often. Pelipper's subpar Speed means that it has less opportunities to use Defog and Roost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The most viable other option is an offensive set with a Life Orb; a moveset of Agility or Tailwind, Roost, Hurricane, and Hydro Pump; an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe; and a Modest nature. However, this set faces fierce competition from Swanna as an offensive Pokemon with Water / Flying typing due to Swanna's better Speed. Hurricane can be used over U-turn on the defensive set if your team has trouble with Grass-types like Leafeon, but in general, Pelipper misses the momentum that it gains by using U-turn. Toxic can be used to wear down opposing Pokemon, such as Stunfisk or Vullaby, but the loss of offensive momentum from U-turn makes Pelipper more passive than it already is, and Pelipper simply does not have the moveslot for it. A specially defensive set can be used, but has a harder time checking threats in the metagame such as Monferno and Floatzel. Instead, this set checks threats like Simipour and Simisear.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types:</strong>: Most Electric-types, such as Zebstrika, Rotom-F, and Raichu, can OHKO Pelipper with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers:</strong>: Pelipper's Special Defense is subpar, so powerful special attackers like Mr. Mime, Swanna, and Chatot can OHKO or 2HKO Pelipper with their STAB moves.In addition, Pokemon with Electric-type coverage, such as Regice or Hidden Power Electric Floatzel, can also OHKO or severely dent Pelipper.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald threatens checks to Pelipper's teammates due to its chance to burn. Defog is one of the main reasons to use defensive Pelipper, as it clears entry hazards away for teammates like Simisear and Regice that don't appreciate switching into Stealth Rock. Roost recovers HP, allowing Pelipper to become a more reliable check to physical attackers like Monferno and Mawile. U-turn allows Pelipper to gain momentum when the opponent switches out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Neither of Pelipper's abilities are particularly useful, but in order to run Defog, it needs Keen Eye. This EV spread, along with an Impish nature, is used in order to maximize Pelipper's physical bulk. The 248 HP EVs minimize damage from Stealth Rock. Leftovers gives Pelipper passive recovery that allows it to check physical attackers more often. Pelipper can run an alternative EV spread of 160 HP / 252 Def / 96 Spe with an Impish nature in order to outspeed fully invested, neutral-natured Pokemon with base 45 Speed like Golem and Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pelipper should switch in on Pokemon that it walls like Monferno or Camerupt so it can have a chance to go for Defog or Roost. Remember your priorities when using Pelipper. If you need it healthy in order to check an opposing Pokemon, then it's likely you should go for Roost when given a free turn. However, if you need entry hazards off the field because your wincon is weak to them, then you should consider going for Defog first. You can spam Scald in order to try and burn bulkier Pokemon as they switch into Pelipper, crippling them for Pelipper's teammates. For example, if the foe switches in Regice to take on Pelipper, burning it will cripple it by wearing it down. If your opponent has a Pawniard or Purugly, be careful about when to use Defog, as you will give them an Attack boost from Defiant if you use it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong wallbreakers such as Cacturne and Stoutland, which appreciate free switches that Pelipper provides by using a slow U-turn, are great partners for it. Pelipper pairs well with other Pokemon that use Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Zebstrika or Monferno, as together they gain lots of momentum. Chinchou is a good example of this because it creates a defensive core with Pelipper in which Chinchou covers Pelipper's weaknesses and vice-versa. Teammates that are weak to entry hazards, such as Regice, Rotom-F, and Rapidash, appreciate Pelipper's ability to use Defog. Pokemon that appreciate Fire-types being checked, such as Cacturne and Regice, are great teammates for Pelipper. Finally, Pokemon that can take Electric-type attacks for Pelipper, such as Golem or Chinchou, are great partners for it.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Masquerain is an unfortunate Pokemon that is simply outclassed in everything it tries to do. As a Quiver Dance user, it's very weak and outclassed by Butterfree, which is much stronger and has Sleep Powder, and as a Sticky Web setter, it's wholly outdone by Leavanny, which has much better offensive presence. Additionally, Masquerain has an awful typing and very poor defensive stats, making it unable to effectively make use of Intimidate. It's reliant on Focus Sash to do anything, but Stealth Rock not only breaks it but also takes 50% of Masquerain's health. Furthermore, even if it does set up, its poor Speed leaves it very easy to revenge kill. Masquerain has unique coverage, but it is simply not worth using on any serious team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Masquerain has many potential sets such as Sticky Web and defensive Defog, but all are either poor or outclassed in one way or another.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Masquerain's abysmal bulk, all faster attackers such as Simisage and Stoutland are able to severely cripple or KO it. It can also be outsped by Floatzel, Zebstrika, Electrode, Ninjask, and all common Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime and Chatot at +1 Speed.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock automatically halves Masquerain's health and breaks its Focus Sash, leaving it unable to set up reliably.</p>",

Air Slash allows Masquerain to threaten Monferno and Roselia, and Ice Beam hits Flying- and Dragon-types such as Jumpluff and Altaria. Hydro Pump is an alternative to threaten Fire- and Ground-types such as Golem, Stunfisk, and Camerupt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash allows Masquerain to survive a single hit at full health and is generally the only way for it to set up. Intimidate can help reduce physical damage done to Masquerain slightly or at least give its teammates an easier time revenge killing the foe once Masquerain has been KOed. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature let Masquerain outspeed everything up to and including Jumpluff, while maximum Special Attack investment boosts Masquerain's poor offensive presence as much as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Only switch Masquerain in when Stealth Rock is not on the field to keep its Focus Sash intact. Attempt to remove priority users such as Floatzel and Pawniard before sweeping, as they can KO Masquerain regardless of Speed boosts. If possible, attempt to set up on foes such as Vullaby that are weak enough for Masquerain to set up two or three Quiver Dances to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf users, as well as Pokemon that naturally outspeed Masquerain at +1, including Floatzel and Zebstrika.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers such as Cryogonal and Vibrava can keep Stealth Rock off the field for Masquerain. Probopass can help remove priority users like Pawniard and Metang. Pokemon that can KO Audino such as Stoutland and Monferno are appreciated, as Masquerain cannot do significant damage to it and Audino can lock Masquerain into a single move with Encore.</p>"

What does set Delcatty apart from the giraffe is Wonder Skin, which makes status moves have only a 50% chance of hitting Delcatty, meaning that it can set up Substitute or Calm Mind in the face of Taunt users such as Grumpig and Misdreavus with few worries, though it still isn't saying much. Hyper Voice is Delcatty's main attacking move, though the amount it does will be miniscule without many boosts. Shadow Ball is the best coverage Delcatty can hope for, threatening Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, which are immune to Hyper Voice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP gives Delcatty some \"bulk.\" Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Delcatty to outspeed Adamant Stoutland and Monferno.

In addition to this, Volbeat can utilize a slow U-turn to get in weather sweepers such as Golduck and Sawsbuck safely. It also has the ability to provide invaluable support with Thunder Wave and Encore, with the former helping it stop fast and powerful threats such as Dodrio and Sawsbuck and the latter giving Volbeat's teammates a free turn. However, a weakness to Stealth Rock and a lack of reliable recovery mean that it is worn down easily. Volbeat also has middling bulk, which makes it hard for it to set up weather later in the game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volbeat can run Roost for reliable recovery, but it lacks the moveslot for it. Tailwind provides a Speed boost to Volbeat's teammates, but Volbeat doesn't have the space for it. Substitute allows Volbeat to avoid status moves, but it wears Volbeat down even more quickly. Toxic cripples bulky walls such as Pelipper and Gourgeist-XL, but Thunder Wave is preferred due to its ability to stop fast threats such as Chlorophyll Jumpluff.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As Volbeat is worn down easily due to its lack of reliable recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock, residual damage can add up quickly and KO it. Burns and Toxic poison are also a problem for Volbeat, as the former weakens its U-turn while the latter puts a timer on it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Because of Volbeat's average bulk, strong attackers such as Stoutland and Simipour have no trouble dealing with it. However, they must watch out for Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Weather Checks</strong>: Chlorophyll Choice Scarf Sawsbuck and Chlorophyll Jumpluff are huge threats to sun teams, but they must watch out for Volbeat's Thunder Wave. Sun setters such as Golem and rain setters such as Relicanth prevent Volbeat from setting up rain and sun, respectively. Although rare, Hippopotas's Sand Stream forces Volbeat to switch in and manually change the weather.</p>",

      "Weather Supporter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sunny Day allows sun sweepers such as Sawsbuck and Leafeon to sweep, while Rain Dance gives rain sweepers such as Golduck and Floatzel the chance to sweep. U-turn gets in teammates safely and allows Volbeat to pivot out from an unfavorable matchup. Encore provides free turns for Volbeat's teammates and allows Volbeat to lock passive Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Roselia into an unfavorable move. Encore also prevents setup sweepers such as Clefairy and Klang from attacking. Thunder Wave cripples fast and powerful threats such as Dodrio, Simipour, and Rapidash, which pose a threat to Volbeat. Thunder Wave also cripples Chlorophyll Jumpluff and Sawsbuck, which are big threats to sun teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Volbeat's bulk and allows it to tank as many physical hits as possible. 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature allow Volbeat to provide a slow but strong U-turn, letting sun sweepers such as Sawsbuck and rain sweepers such as Golduck get in safely. Prankster gives priority to Rain Dance and Sunny Day, which almost always guarantees weather setup, as well as Thunder Wave and Encore. Damp Rock and Heat Rock increase the number of turns of rain and sun, respectively, giving weather sweepers a longer time to sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Preserving Volbeat is crucial, as it provides great utility, so it should be sent in whenever weather is needed or after the turns of weather have ended. However, don't be afraid to sacrifice Volbeat just to set up weather, as doing so also allows a rain or sun sweeper to switch in safely. Volbeat should focus on setting up Sunny Day or Rain Dance before it does anything else, and it should use U-turn directly after it sets up weather, allowing its teammates to make the most use of it. The combination of Encore and Thunder Wave can cripple opposing leads as well, but bear in mind that it is quite predictable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volbeat only fits on weather teams, as they are able to take advantage of rain or sun. Weather sweepers are absolutely compulsory so that they can take advantage of Volbeat's weather. Some examples are Golduck, Beartic, and Floatzel for rain teams and Sawsbuck, Weepinbell, and Leafeon for sun teams. Other weather setters such as Relicanth for rain and Golem and Onix for sun are able to set up weather in case Volbeat faints. Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika can use a perfectly accurate Thunder in rain and take on Water-types such as Politoed; the former can also absorb Electric-type attacks. Swanna can utilize a perfectly accurate Hurricane in the rain and heal its status ailments thanks to Hydration. In sun, Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales are able to switch in on predicted Fire-type attacks and also get a boost to their own Fire-type attacks. Zebstrika works well on sun teams because of its ability to counter Jumpluff, which is a huge threat to such teams.</p>"

However, that is the only upside to Illumise, as it is weak, frail, and not especially fast. On the support side, it is entirely outclassed by Volbeat, which has the same stats but stronger U-turns. Offensively, wallbreakers like Stoutland and Mawile have far too many advantages over Illumise regardless of the lack of prediction required. Illumise is affected by all entry hazards and cannot function throughout the match if they're up. It has a hard time against offensive teams, as it is easily KOed and its wallbreaking isn't as valuable. Illumise is simply woefully outclassed in a support role, and its offensive stats just don't cut it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Weather sets with Rain Dance or Sunny Day are usable, but because a slow U-turn is preferred on such builds, Volbeat completely outclasses Illumise for that set due to its higher Attack.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is the main move Illumise should be using most of the time, as it hits significantly harder than everything else and very few foes resist it when Tinted Lens is factored in. Thunderbolt and Giga Drain can handle a few targets, with the former OHKOing Pelipper and the latter handling specially defensive Golem once Sturdy is broken. U-turn can allow Illumise to pivot out of bad matchups, while Tailwind can be used for team support if Illumise is about to be KOed by a slower Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment, a Modest nature, and Choice Specs all attempt to make Illumise hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature can still be used with U-turn, as its utility is in pivoting rather than dealing damage and Illumise does not want to decrease its mediocre defenses. Tinted Lens is the saving grace of the set, allowing Illumise to hit neutrally with normally resisted moves. This makes Bug Buzz a significantly better STAB move, as it allows Illumise to bypass common Bug-type switch-ins such as Mawile without the need for prediction. Maximum Speed investment allows Illumise to outpace major threats such as Adamant Stoutland and Monferno.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Illumise should be sent in on very weak attacks, such as Lumineon's Scald, or on a setup move such as Duosion's Calm Mind. Most specially defensive staples such as Audino and Clefairy can wall Illumise fairly easily, so predict their switches with U-turn whenever possible. Tailwind should only be used if Illumise is about to be KOed by a slower Pokemon, as there is not enough time to exploit the Speed boost if Illumise survives and is forced to switch out. Try to wallbreak as early as possible, as Illumise's late-game utility is extremely low.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Illumise is very quickly worn down by all forms of entry hazards, so spinners or Defoggers, such as Armaldo and Pelipper, are instrumental in helping Illumise to do its work over the course of the match. However, Illumise also loves entry hazard support to chip away at its switch-ins, so Stealth Rock and Spikes setters such as Golem and Roselia are highly useful. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Mawile appreciate Illumise's ability to bait in and pivot out of special walls like Clefairy, giving them a free breaking opportunity. Special sweepers such as Gorebyss can theoretically benefit from Illumise's wallbreaking, if it manages to actually weaken anything bulky.</p>"

Sadly, Torkoal is weak to Stealth Rock itself without having reliable recovery, and it is also extremely slow, meaning it loses to faster offensive Pokemon like Simipour.

Earth Power allows Torkoal to break through Pokemon that switch into Fire Blast, such as Ninetales and Probopass. Once Torkoal lured in spinblockers and dealt enough damage to your opponent's team, it can Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards and keep other team members healthy. Hidden Power Electric can also be useful over Earth Power to damage bulky Water-types such as Politoed and Pelipper, even being able to OHKO the latter of the two.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with max Speed is essential to allow Torkoal to outspeed spinblockers such as Misdreavus after a Shell Smash. Max Special Attack is used to help dish out as much damage as possible. A Life Orb lets Torkoal OHKO Misdreavus after Stealth Rock, but leaves Torkoal vulnerable to priority and faster Pokemon. Using a White Herb means Torkoal's defenses won't drop after the first Shell Smash, allowing Torkoal to survive priority moves such as Floatzel's Aqua Jet.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torkoal should be brought in to remove entry hazards for other team members, especially against physical attackers such as Leafeon and Pawniard, as they do damage to it and it can Rapid Spin on them. Make sure to Rapid Spin before hazards can cripple Torkoal or its team too much, but wait until the opponent's hazard setters can't easily set them back up. Although Torkoal has the power after a Shell Smash to sweep, it should only Shell Smash when it needs to beat spinblockers. Torkoal can also be helpful for punching holes in bulkier teams. Once you have taken out all of your opponent's Pokemon that are faster than Torkoal at +2, you can use Torkoal as a sweeper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torkoal works well with Pokemon that don't appreciate entry hazards, such as Jumpluff and Dodrio, as Torkoal beats common spinblockers after a Shell Smash and removes hazards. Torkoal appreciates Grass- and Electric-types such as Jumpluff, Gourgeist-XL, Raichu, and Rotom-F as partners to check Water-types. Torkoal appreciates bulky Water-types such as Lumineon and Pelipper as teammates, because they can take on Water- and Ground-types that Torkoal can't take on. Torkoal appreciates a slow Volt Switch or U-turn to bring it in, as it doesn't appreciate taking any unnecessary damage.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Torkoal to rack up damage on the opposing team's Pokemon every time they switch in. Lava Plume is a very spammable STAB move with a 30% chance to burn every time it's used, meaning physical attackers cannot safely set up on Torkoal. Toxic sets Pokemon on a timer and wears them down quickly, and Earthquake hits Pokemon like Ninetales, which prevents it from being setup fodder. Run a Bold nature if you are using Toxic and a Relaxed nature if you are using Earthquake, so that Torkoal's Earthquake won't be weakened. Yawn is an alternate option over Toxic and Earthquake that forces switches, allowing Torkoal to rack up more Stealth Rock damage, and provides a turn to Rapid Spin as the foe switches. Rapid Spin lets Torkoal clear away entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 248 HP EVs, Torkoal can switch into Stealth Rock four times, and with 28 SpD EVs it can take Ancient Power from offensive Tangela twice or Sludge Bomb twice from offensive Roselia. With 232 Defense EVs and a Bold nature, Torkoal can take plenty of physical hits. Leftovers is essential to allow Torkoal to gain small bits of recovery. A Relaxed nature should be used with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torkoal is able to switch into common physical setup sweepers such as Leafeon and Pawniard, and should mainly be used to set up Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin away entry hazards. Torkoal should stay in and Rapid Spin on Pokemon that it isn't threatened much by, such as passive walls or physical attackers. Torkoal is very physically bulky, but because it doesn't have access to reliable recovery, it isn't able to switch into too many hits. Be wary of Ghost-types, as they can block Rapid Spin and some of them, such as Misdreavus, can wear Torkoal down. Lava Plume and Toxic are very spammable moves that can easily cripple the foe. Make sure that Torkoal doesn't take too much residual damage from hazards or Toxic, as it is easily worn down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Torkoal works well with Wish and Heal Bell support provided by clerics such as Audino, as it doesn't have reliable recovery and it is easily worn down by entry hazards and Toxic. Because Torkoal has low Special Defense, it is important to have a Pokemon more suitable to switch into those kinds of attacks, such as Lickilicky. Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL are great options to go along with Torkoal, as some of Torkoal's main weaknesses are covered by them and Torkoal covers most of their weaknesses in exchange. Defensive Torkoal fits best on defensive playstyles, such as stall. Certain hazard-weak Pokemon like Rotom-F and Dodrio pair well with Torkoal because it can Rapid Spin away hazards for them. Torkoal works well on teams that rely on keeping away entry hazards but can't afford to use Defog. Torkoal appreciates a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, from Probopass or Lumineon since it allows Torkoal to come in for without taking any damage. Lastly, Torkoal appreciates a Pursuit trapper such as Pawniard, which can take out Ghost-types that try to prevent Torkoal from spinning.</p>"

Pawniard can trap Lunatone with Pursuit and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Audino and Grumpig can take two hits from Lunatone and either retaliate with Knock Off or cripple it with status.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzor completely walls Lunatone lacking Shadow Ball, and can still chip Shadow Ball variants with Psywave. Conversely, Klang and Probopass wall sets lacking Earth Power and can easily KO Lunatone with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic wears down Lunatone over the course of a match, whereas paralysis cripples it so slower Pokemon can outspeed and possibly KO it. While Lunatone does not mind being burned, the residual damage wears it down nonetheless, limiting how long Lunatone can last.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Lunatone's reliance on Life Orb for maximum damage output combined with Lunatone's susceptibility to priority attacks such as Mightyena's and Pawniard's Sucker Punch and Basculin's and Floatzel's Aqua Jet will cut into its longevity. If these attacks don't KO Lunatone, they certainly will put it in range to be KOed next turn.</p>",

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish doubles Lunatone's Speed, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Sawsbuck after a boost. Psychic is Lunatone's strongest STAB move, hitting Poison- and Fighting-types such as Roselia and Monferno for great damage. Ancient Power is Lunatone's Rock-type STAB attack, allowing it to hit Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Rapidash, Dodrio, and Rotom-F super effectively. Earth Power nails Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard, which resist Lunatone's dual STAB moves. Shadow Ball is an option which allows Lunatone to hit Bronzor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment along with a Modest nature allows for maximum damage output. Maximum Speed investment allows Lunatone to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Sawsbuck after a Rock Polish boost. Levitate is Lunatone's only ability, providing an immunity to Ground-type attacks as well as Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web. Life Orb is the preferred item on Lunatone, boosting the power of all of its attacks at the cost of some health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to use Lunatone mid- or late-game when its checks and counters are eliminated or weak enough for Lunatone to take out on its own. Set up Rock Polish on Flying- and Fire-types that Lunatone can force out such as Articuno and Ninetales. Lunatone must also be wary of Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Dusknoir as they can deal significant damage to Lunatone. Keep Lunatone as healthy as possible when it attempts to sweep, as poison wears Lunatone down over time, and paralysis puts a damper on its Speed. Avoid attempting to set up in the face of strong physical wallbreakers, as Lunatone doesn't have good Defense. Switch in Lunatone off of a slow Volt Switch or U-turn or after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Bronzor, Roselia, and Stunfisk allows Lunatone to get 2HKOs and OHKOs on Regice and Ninetales, respectively, with Ancient Power. Wallbreakers such as Simipour and Chatot can wear down bulkier threats for Lunatone, making it easier for it to come in and clean up. Lunatone also appreciates Memento and Encore support from Pokemon such as Jumpluff to allow Lunatone to set up Rock Polish easier. As Lunatone is frail and easily worn down, Healing Wish support from Mr. Mime can be useful to revive a weakened Lunatone, giving it a second chance to sweep.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Solrock's high Defense and almost unique typing allow it to check threatening Pokemon such as Stoutland and Rapidash, making it a decent wall in the PU metagame. Unfortunately, it is weak to four common types, and only one of those, Dark, is primarily physical. Solrock also has an excellent ability in Levitate, allowing it to check Ground-types, such as Golem, and Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to hit Rock-types. Its great support movepool, which includes Will-O-Wisp, Stealth Rock, and Morning Sun, helps its walling capabilities, and access to Light Screen, Reflect, and a fast Explosion allow it to successfully pull off a dual screens set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used to hit Rock- and Steel-types such as Golem and Pawniard, but most already dislike Will-O-Wisp. Fire Blast does a decent amount of damage to Tangela and Avalugg, but requires a negative Speed nature to be useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Tangela and Quilladin, can take a hit, deal heavy damage with their Grass-type STAB moves, or set up entry hazards on Solrock, but Quilladin fears Will-O-Wisp. Simisage can freely use Nasty Plot, while Substitute Leafeon can set up Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Simipour and Floatzel can switch in, survive a hit, and retaliate back with their Water-type STAB moves. Simipour can also set up Nasty Plot, while Floatzel can set up Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with a Type Advantage</strong>: Dark-types, such as Mightyena and Pawniard, can deal heavy damage with their Dark-type STAB moves, but they really dislike Will-O-Wisp. Klang can use Solrock to set up with Shift Gear, Rest off a burn, and then KO Solrock with Gear Grind.</p> <p><strong>Misdreavus</strong>: Misdreavus has enough bulk to stomach any hit from Solrock. It can Taunt or burn Solrock, set up a Nasty Plot, and deal heavy damage with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Solrock's poor Special Defense means that it is easily beaten by special attackers such as Raichu and Ninetales, which don't mind being burned. They can also outspeed Solrock and deal enough damage to KO it after the second hit if Light Screen is up.</p> <p><strong>Defog</strong>: Defog from Pokemon such as Pelipper and Swanna will remove Solrock's screens and Stealth Rock. Swanna is also faster than Solrock, so can get a Defog off before Solrock explodes.</p> <p><strong>Bulk Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers, such as Clefairy, Beheeyem, and Duosion, do not care about Will-O-Wisp and take little damage from Solrock's attacks, and can set up Calm Minds.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an important move as it wears down the opposing team, which is helpful as Solrock forces many switches. Morning Sun provides Solrock with reliable recovery. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, letting Solrock check them more easily, and annoys switch-ins such as Tangela. An attacking move is important to prevent Solrock from being setup fodder. Rock Slide is preferred, as it helps Solrock beat Fire- and Flying-types, while Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Pokemon such as Muk and Monferno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs along with an Impish nature allow Solrock to switch into physical attackers more easily. Leftovers provides passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Solrock's high Defense allows it to be switched into strong physical attackers such as Stoutland. Stealth Rock is Solrock's main priority, as it is more effective when set up early-game. Will-O-Wisp is Solrock's most spammable move, as it cripples physical attackers and annoys switch-ins such as Tangela. Solrock should be aware of Morning Sun's low PP, which can easily be stalled out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Solrock fits best on defensively based teams, as it can check wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Rapidash. Monferno is a good teammate, as it resists Bug, Dark, and Steel while Solrock resists Psychic- and Flying-type moves. Roselia can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which complement Stealth Rock, and can beat Grass- and Water-types, whereas Solrock checks Flying-, Psychic-, and Fire-types. Altaria checks Grass- and Bug-types and can provide Heal Bell support. Special walls such as Audino are good partners, as Solrock can take physical hits for them. Audino also provides Heal Bell support. Spinblockers such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus are helpful to keep entry hazards on the field, but Solrock shares two weaknesses with them; however, Gourgeist resists Grass and Water. Bulky Calm Mind users, such as Clefairy, appreciate the removal and burning of physical attackers that can revenge kill them, and Solrock also resists Poison-type moves, which Clefairy is weak to.</p>"

      "Sun Screen": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Light Screen and Reflect provide support for teammates, particularly setup sweepers which cannot take many hits. Stealth Rock also supports Solrock's team by wearing down the opponent's Pokemon. Explosion breaks Substitutes, prevents Pokemon from setting up on Solrock, and most importantly, blocks a slower Defog while providing a free switch in for a teammate. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back entry hazards and Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Solrock outspeed as many foes as possible in a lead scenario, making it more likely that it will be able to set up a screen or Stealth Rock. Maximum HP investment increases Solrock's mixed bulk and its ability to set up on stronger Pokemon. Light Clay increases the number of dual screens turns, providing more time for Solrock's teammates to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Solrock can be used as a lead to get up Stealth Rock early or can also be played later if the opponent counter-leads with a Pokemon that can outspeed and 2HKO it. The presence of Stealth Rock means that the opponent's team will be worn down more, which is beneficial for setup sweepers. Solrock should set up the screen that corresponds with the Pokemon it is facing first to maximize its chances of setting up the other screen. It should use Explosion on slower Defog users if screens are present and entry hazards up to block the Defog, or if it wants to safely get a team ate in, but if Solrock is at high enough health, it can be saved for later. Solrock prefers to set up on defensive Pokemon, such as Probopass, as well as physical attackers that it beats, such as Rapidash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Frail setup sweepers such as Huntail, Raichu, and Fraxure greatly appreciate dual screen support to set up more easily, and entry hazard damage is also important in wearing the foe down. Other frail offensive Pokemon such as Simisear and Floatzel also appreciate dual screen support, and Substitute attackers such as Rotom-F enjoy dual screens, as it makes their Substitutes harder to break. Pawniard can deter Defog, as it has Defiant, and enjoys dual screen support to set Swords Dance more safely. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus are good teammates, as they help keep hazards on field. Solrock should only be used on hyper offensive teams that can make use of the limited screen turns and offensively pressure the opponent's Defog users.</p>"

  "Castform": {
    "overview": "<p>Castform is the living proof that if man ever hopes to emulate nature's beauty in its creation of living things, there's still a long way to go. While nature has concocted majestic dragons and serpents such as Salamence and Milotic, all that the top scientists from Hoenn could muster is a disfigured cluster of water molecules that they aptly classified as a Normal-type and whose entire lower half looks like one huge ass. Not very professional of them.</p> <p>At least they weren't lying about Castform's half-assed battling capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Castform can wield other items, such as a Life Orb to secure the OHKO on frail Pokemon such as Raichu or a Focus Sash to actually help it survive hits. However, why bother trying to improve on its battling when Castform is clearly only useful in setting up the weather and fainting? Castform also actually has a very wide movepool that includes moves such as Thunder, Blizzard, Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and even Hurricane. However, if you're going such great lengths as to use Castform, you would want to play it to its niche, being the PU Pokemon with the most diverse colors and coolest STAB move. Not only will Castform have too little space on its moveset to fit these in, but it will probably also get KOed before it gets the chance to use them anyway. You could run Sandstorm, but the Hoenn scientists couldn't even be bothered to make a forme for it in sand despite the existence of a colossal desert in the middle of the region. So, what's the point if there's no cool forme change to go along with it?</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Cloud Nine</strong>: And you thought that Castform couldn't possibly get any worse. Cloud Nine users, such as Lickilicky and Golduck, are the antithesis of Castform: they stop Forecast, they stop Weather Ball, and they are actually good Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>A Good Team</strong>: If it's not hit super effectively, it counters Castform. Chances are, if you aren't bringing a monotype Bug team just for giggles, you can probably already counter Castform by switching a bit.</p>",

      "Chasing Rainbows": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance turns Castform blue and dampens the spirits of the opponent. Sunny Day turns Castform red, turning up the heat on the opponent and firing Castform up for battle. Hail turns Castform blue again, sending a chill down the opponent's spine. This array of colors will take your opponents by storm and dazzle them into submission. And after this fascinating display, the trump card can be revealed: Castform's almost-signature move Weather Ball, a three-in-one coverage move that only takes up one moveslot, only takes one turn to set up, and only actually KOes its foes if it hits super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is used to grant Castform some power, although \"modest\" is also a bit of an overstatement of Castform's potential. You can choose to lengthen a weather of your choice by using a Damp Rock, a Heat Rock, or an Icy Rock, but whichever you pick, weather rocks. Castform doesn't. Its ability is Forecast, but it doesn't even tell you that it's going to rain until the rain has been set up and you're all drenched in the downpour. Those scientists sure had one job.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Castform to tell you the weather outside without you even having to turn around to look out the window. Use Castform as a disco ball that has a wide array of colors from its many forme changes, namely red and blue. Use Castform as a police siren; its wide spectrum of colors from its forme changes will probably achieve the desired effect all the same. Use Castform to boil a hot, soothing cup of herbal tea if you're feeling a little under the weather, as the molecules in its body are just like water. Use Castform as death fodder to bring in another Pokemon safely. Castform can be used as just about anything under the sun. Just don't bring it into the battlefield and expect to grab KOs with it, to survive hits with it, or to win battles with it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Castform can do with teammates that help it to set up weather so that it can change color and start firing off Weather Ball as soon as possible; it won't get much time before it is KOed, after all. Electrode is a great teammate, and not just because it can set up Rain Dance. Being a ball that can set up weather, it also complements Castform's Weather Ball perfectly. In addition, adding Electrode as a teammate to Castform is a good choice, because they are both floating heads and two heads are better than one. Castform could also do with teammates that can sweep the opponent's team under the correct weather conditions. Flower Gift Cherrim is a very fitting teammate for Castform: Cherrim also doesn't have a body, can also use Weather Ball, and is just about as good at sweeping its foes as Castform is at predicting the weather.</p> <p>Apart from weather support, any other kind of support will also do to help Castform to perform its job at a minimal standard. This can range from Stealth Rock support to help secure the KO on Zebstrika, to dual screens support to help avoid the 2HKO from Dusknoir's Shadow Sneak and Zebstrika's Volt Switch on neutral hits, to paralysis support to help it outspeed and 2HKO Persian.</p>"

It also has a varied movepool with handy support moves, such as Heal Bell, Thunder Wave, and Taunt, giving it a niche over other Healing Wish users such as Mr. Mime and Clefairy. It also has Levitate, giving it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Camerupt. However, Chimecho faces competition from Audino, which boasts better bulk, and it is commonly walled by Dark-types, such as Pawniard and Mightyena. It also has a low Speed stat, which makes it vulnerable to Taunt users, such as Misdreavus and Grumpig, and it doesn't have much offensive presence, so it can't fit on many teams except defensive ones. It is also setup fodder for sweepers, such as Pawniard and Clefairy, unless it carries Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chimecho could run Toxic in the fourth moveslot to rack up damage on opposing Pokemon and make it easier for other teammates to KO them. Knock Off can be used to remove the foe's item, but Chimecho has a low Attack stat and won't do much damage with the move. Chimecho could also run Wish, but it is outclassed as a Wish passer by Audino, which boasts more bulk. Chimecho could run Yawn to force switches on Pokemon trying to stay in. Magic Coat allows Chimecho to bounce back Taunt and other status moves, but it is unreliable. Chimecho could use its slow Speed to run a Trick Room set with 0 Speed IVs and a Speed-decreasing nature. Cosmic Power may seem viable, but it should never be used on Chimecho, as it is weak to setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Raichu and is very passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users, such as Misdreavus and Grumpig, easily outspeed Chimecho and do not mind taking a Psychic. Additionally, the former has a super effective Shadow Ball, while the latter has Heal Bell to cure it from Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types, such as Pawniard, are immune to Psychic. In particular, Pawniard can set up on Chimecho unless it carries Taunt, cripple it with Knock Off, or Pursuit trap it if it tries to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Audino, Articuno, and Grumpig, can easily take a Psychic from Chimecho and have Heal Bell to heal paralysis. Lickilicky also has Oblivious, which prevents Chimecho from Taunting it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Probopass and Klang, wall Chimecho, as they resist Psychic. The former can proceed to set up Stealth Rock, while the latter can set up with Shift Gear. However, both dislike taking a Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, such as Bouffalant and Stoutland, can take a hit from Chimecho and deal quite a bit of damage back with their strong attacks. Also, the former is immune to Thunder Wave, and the latter can use paralysis to its advantage with a more powerful Facade.</p>",

Psychic is Chimecho's only attacking move and hits Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Monferno, Roselia, and Arbok, for super effective damage. Heal Bell can be handy to heal a teammate from burn, poison, or paralysis. Thunder Wave cripples a Pokemon by lowering its Speed. Taunt cripples Pokemon that rely on non-attacking moves, preventing them from setting up entry hazards or inflicting Toxic, but because Chimecho is slow, it isn't as effective as Heal Bell or Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD and a Calm nature maximizes Chimecho's special bulk, allowing it to take as many hits as possible from special attackers such as Simipour and Mr. Mime. Levitate gives Chimecho an immunity to Ground-type moves and prevents it from being crippled by Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Leftovers provides additional recovery, which can be handy to keep Chimecho healthy throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chimecho should not be switching into strong physical attackers, such as Stoutland and Dodrio, due to its mediocre physical bulk without investment. Chimecho should use Thunder Wave in order to cripple its foes early-game so that its teammates can revenge kill them more easily. Chimecho should be wary of using Healing Wish, as it could be needed later in the match, and it should use Healing Wish to restore cleaners and setup sweepers that lack a recovery move, such as Stoutland and Ursaring, rather than bulky walls. Chimecho should frequently use Recover in order to stay healthy. If Chimecho has Taunt, use it on Pokemon that it outspeeds, such as Stunfisk and Quilladin, to prevent them from setting up entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chimecho fits best on balanced or stall teams because of its passive nature and nice support movepool. Monferno can cover Dark- and Steel-types for Chimecho while it provides Healing Wish and Heal Bell utility in return. Wallbreakers, such as Stoutland and Ursaring, can take down physically defensive walls for Chimecho while it provides Healing Wish support. Revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Chatot, can outspeed setup sweepers that use Chimecho as setup bait, such as Leafeon. In return, Chimecho provides these teammates with Healing Wish and Heal Bell support. Setup sweepers, such as Ninetales and Simipour, appreciate Healing Wish support from Chimecho in order to have a second chance at sweeping.

For the most part, Deoxys's and Rotom's formes all serve different roles in their respective, mostly higher, tiers; however, Game Freak decided to give the Wormadam formes a Bug typing, which works terribly with their defensively oriented stats, and gave them all the same role: to be death fodder. Wormadam does not even get a half-good typing like its Steel-type sister, Wormadam-S, nor access to decent utility moves like Stealth Rock. Well, at least it does not look like food, unlike its sisters Wormadam-G and Wormadam-S, which resemble a slice of pizza and cotton candy, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set with moves such as Toxic and Synthesis allows Wormadam to take on Water-types better, but its multitude of weaknesses hinders this. Although it is 2HKOed by Psychic, Roselia still forces Wormadam out. Skill Swap can be used to annoy incoming Ninetales and Rapidash by taking their Flash Fire ability, but opponents can easily play around such a strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Although Wormadam can threaten some special walls, such as Pelipper and Grumpig, others, such as Lickilicky and Probopass, do not really care about anything Wormadam does. Roselia can just begin Spikes-stacking in front of Wormadam's face. Although it is immune to Sleep Powder, Wormadam will be made to cry itself off to sleep after being hit with Roselia's Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Wormadam's plethora of weaknesses, it would be easier just to tl;dr this. Ninetales, Rapidash, Dodrio, Golem, Arbok, Combusken, Chatot, and Jumpluff are only a small percentage of top-tier Pokemon that can OHKO Wormadam with little or no prior damage.</p>",

Choice Specs-boosted Leaf Storm can hit fairly hard despite Wormadam's mediocre Special Attack, and Giga Drain does not cause Wormadam's Special Attack stat to drop by two stages. Lastly, Hidden Power Rock hits Fire- and Flying-types, meaning Ninetales and Jumpluff can set up on Wormadam only once with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs not only gives the bagworm a snazzy look but also lets it do some decent damage when combined with maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature. The remaining EVs go into HP, as Wormadam cannot hope to outspeed most Pokemon, and at least it lets Wormadam take a hit from several Water-types such as Floatzel and Politoed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Click Leaf Storm 90% of the time, as that does decent damage. If you fear a Grass-type switching in, just go for a coverage move to hit the incoming Pokemon; otherwise, Giga Drain can be used to regain health. Wormadam might be able to switch into certain Water- and Grass-types, such as Floatzel and Tangela, but it might get blown back by a coverage move, so it should be careful. Wormadam might also be useful as death fodder late-game if one of its teammates needs a safe switch in. Also be careful as to which move Wormadam gets locked into, as it can be used as setup fodder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If you have gotten this far and still want to use Wormadamâ€” please do not; use Tangela or Roselia instead. If you really have to use Wormadam, use it on teams that provide heavy paralysis support or on a Trick Room team. Wormadam also needs teammates to cover its weaknesses, though covering every one of them would be almost impossible, so just try to cover some. Wormadam should be supported by checks to Fire-types, such as Grumpig and Pelipper; checks to Flying-types, such as Probopass and Stunfisk; Pokemon that resist Ice, such as Probopass and Grumpig; and Pokemon that can take on Rock-types such as Lumineon and Gabite. Entry hazard removers such as Pelipper and Armaldo are also important, as Wormadam cannot afford to lose a quarter of its health. Yeah, it would be simpler just to not use this unloved worm.</p>"

Most bulky Water-types, Lumineon included, can switch into Wormadam-G and not take much from an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg and Pelipper take minimal damage from any move Wormadam can go for and can wear it down with attacks or, in the case of Avalugg, remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Bulky setup sweepers such as Duosion and Clefairy easily set up on Wormadam-G.</p> <p><strong>Most Pokemon</strong>: Other than Wobbuffet, most Pokemon can usually 2HKO Wormadam-G with ease. Yes, this includes even Lunatone.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Does this set look familiar? Yes, that is because Golem can do the exact same thing but not suck completely. If you need a more detailed summary of the moves you should go to the <a href=\"http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/golem/\">Golem analysis</a>, as you might be able to get some use out of the Pokemon slot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature let Wormadam-G actually do some damage, and the HP EVs allow it to survive a hit from quite a few physical attackers. Leftovers provides some passive recovery, which Wormadam-G otherwise lacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When it's not out massacring opposing teams, Wormadam-G should just try to set up Stealth Rock. You will be lucky if it ends up doing anything other than maybe dealing some chip damage with Sucker Punch or possibly Rock Blasting an obvious Pelipper switch-in. To ensure that Wormadam-G gets up Stealth Rock, try to switch it into a weak physical attacker. Wormadam-G can switch into the odd physical attacker, such as Arbok lacking Aqua Tail or Golem on a resisted move, but plenty can 2HKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If building with Wormadam-G, you might notice that your team is limited to five slots to accomplish what you usually need six for. This means you need to have a Water-type check, a role fulfilled by Pokemon such as Roselia and Lumineon, and a Fire-type check, examples of which include Pokemon such as Grumpig, Altaria and Pelipper. Wormadam-G also appreciates Flying-type checks such as Probopass and Electabuzz and Ice-type checks such as Grumpig and Ninetales. If you have to use Wormadam-G, it should only be on a balanced or offensive team to make your other Pokemon seem stronger.</p>"

It also lacks reliable recovery and can be setup fodder for Pokemon such as Pawniard and Raichu due to its low offensive presence. Wormadam-S's susceptibility to Taunt from Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Grumpig can hinder its ability to function as a utility Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wormadam-S could attempt a specially attacking set with moves such as Signal Beam and Flash Cannon, but the damage output is still lackluster even with maximum investment in Special Attack. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can be used to better take on Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Grumpig and other special attackers such as Raichu and Tangela. Gyro Ball can make use of Wormadam-S's low Speed and do more damage to faster Pokemon, but the power is inconsistent and Gyro Ball has fewer PP than Iron Head.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales, Rapidash, and Simisear can easily KO Wormadam-S with their respective Fire-type STAB attacks. Furthermore, Ninetales can use Nasty Plot or Substitute as Wormadam-S switches out.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Wormadam-S is very passive, so setup sweepers such as Huntail, Raichu, and Gorebyss can use it as setup fodder and attempt to sweep, but they don't appreciate being poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Even with its bulk, Wormadam-S can easily be 2HKOed by strong special attacks from Pokemon such as Simipour, Floatzel, and Lapras.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages all foes switching in and breaks Sturdy and Focus Sash. Toxic is Wormadam-S's best way to deal any damage, as it puts foes on a timer. Protect allows Wormadam-S to scout for moves while also racking up Toxic damage and recovering some health with Leftovers. Iron Head is Wormadam-S's only attacking move and allows it to both function while Taunted and hit Rock- and Ice-types such as Armaldo and Cryogonal super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in HP maximize Wormadam-S's overall bulk. 252 EVs in Defense along with an Impish nature add to Wormadam-S's physical bulk, allowing it to better handle physical attackers such as Stoutland and Sawsbuck. Leftovers provides passive recovery each turn, which is important because Wormadam-S has no form of reliable recovery. Overcoat is the preferred ability to keep Wormadam-S from being sleep fodder for the likes of Jumpluff and Tangela.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wormadam-S's primary objective is to set up Stealth Rock for its teammates. Toxic should be used often to put opposing foes on a timer. Protect should be used mostly to rack up Toxic damage and to scout for any attacks aimed at Wormadam-S, but it must be used carefully, as foes can use this turn to set up entry hazards or use boosting moves. Because of its typing, Wormadam-S can switch in on attacks from Pokemon such as Stoutland and Jumpluff and either use Toxic or attack with Iron Head.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its lack of offensive presence, Wormadam-S only fits on defensive and stall teams. Pokemon that can take of Fire-types, such as Lumineon and Altaria, make good partners for Wormadam-S. Spikes and Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Quilladin and Roselia complements Wormadam-S's Stealth Rock support to wear down the opposing team faster, but keep in mind that all these Pokemon are weak to Fire-type attacks. Wish support from Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Audino is greatly appreciated, as Wormadam-S is easily worn down.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Cherrim is able to carve out a decent niche for itself in PU as an offensive Healing Wish user. Its decent power, Speed, and coverage help it perform this role effectively. However, that's about all Cherrim has going for it. It faces tons of competition from other Grass-types such as Simisage, as well as from Mr. Mime, which does Cherrim's job mostly better thanks to its higher Speed and better typing. While Cherrim's Speed is decent, it is still outpaced by the majority of the offensive threats in the metagame, which is not helped by its mediocre bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cherrim has few options outside of its normal role. It can attempt to fill a more defensive role, but this is much better done by the likes of Tangela and Roselia. It can also run a similar Choice Scarf set to Mr. Mime's, but Cherrim is too weak without a boosting item for this to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: All Roselia sets beat Hidden Power Rock variants of Cherrim easily, defensive variants take little from Hidden Power Fire, and can freely set up Spikes. Other Grass-types such as Simisage are able to switch into some moves, but they dislike Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, Simisear, and Ninetales can switch into Cherrim if it lacks Hidden Power Rock and can OHKO it with their STAB moves. Additionally, Ninetales and Simisear can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Type Advantage</strong>: Offensive type advantage from Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Arbok can quickly defeat Cherrim. In addtion, Pokemon such as Regice can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Zebstrika, Simipour, and Chatot can make quick work of Cherrim, as it is not very bulky. However, they often struggle to switch in.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Healing Wish is Cherrim's main niche, and it can be used to aid setup sweepers or give Pokemon that have been weakened a second chance at breaking through the opposing team. Energy Ball is a reliable STAB move; its high Base Power makes up for Cherrim's mediocre base Special Attack. However, Giga Drain can be used if you prefer the recovery it provides. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel- and Grass-types such as Metang and Tangela, while Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Fire-types such as Rapidash, which would otherwise easily switch into Cherrim. Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types such as Fraxure and Zweilous. Nature Power can be used to hit Fire- and Dragon-types neutrally if Hidden Power Fire is used. Synthesis can be used to give Cherrim more longevity. Finally, Aromatherapy can be useful to heal Cherrim's team of status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment gives Cherrim enough power to damage foes and lets it make use of its good Speed tier. A Modest nature is used because Timid does not let Cherrim outspeed anything relevant. Life Orb is used to patch up Cherrim's lack of power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Cherrim should focus on dealing damage, as Healing Wish isn't useful until mid- and late-game. Later in the game, it should find the best time to come in and use Healing Wish to bring a crippled teammate back to full health. Cherrim should not be switching into strong attacks, as its bulk is quite underwhelming. Cherrim does not need to use Healing Wish in every game, but try and do so when a teammate at low health or with a status condition matches well against the remainder of the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cherrim should be used on offensive teams, as these teams make the best use of Healing Wish. Sweepers such as Dragon Dance Fraxure, Swords Dance Jumpluff, and Rain Dance Golduck greatly benefit from the new lease on life Cherrim can give them. Pokemon that get worn down quickly, such as Ursaring, also appreciate Healing Wish support. Pokemon that beat both Roselia and Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Grumpig, make for good partners to Cherrim.</p>"

Gigalith's high Defense lets it act as a decent check to Normal- and Flying-types such as Dodrio and Stoutland, but it is, again, outclassed by Golem in this regard. Furthermore, Gigalith's pure Rock typing gives it weaknesses to common attacking types such as Water, Ground, and Grass. Its horrendous Speed lets it get easily worn down by faster and stronger threats such as Simisage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake provides solid coverage alongside Rock Blast, hitting Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard without having to incur the Attack and Defense drop from Superpower. Custap Berry in conjunction with Explosion and Sturdy allows Gigalith to act as a suicide lead, but this is better done by Golem. Choice Band lets Gigalith act as a bulky attacker, dealing out massive damage at the expense of being locked into a move. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with an Impish nature can be used to better check Pokemon such as Ursaring. While Gigalith might seem like an ideal Pokemon to run Assault Vest on, it isn't worth the extra bulk, as it forces Gigalith to forgo Stealth Rock and Toxic, which it needs because its attacking movepool is lackluster; besides, Gigalith is easily worn down without Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist can take a Stone Edge with ease; additionally, the former can put Gigalith to sleep with Sleep Powder or force it out with Giga Drain, while the latter can cripple Gigalith with Will-O-Wisp or heal off any damage taken with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Prinplup, Simipour, and Floatzel can break through Gigalith without much trouble, with the former being able to switch in and scare it out with Scald and a potential burn and the latter two easily OHKOing it with their STAB moves. However, Simipour and Floatzel cannot switch into Gigalith.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Vibrava and Stunfisk resist Rock Blast and can retaliate with Earthquake and Earth Power, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Anti-leads</strong>: Gigalith is extremely slow, so any user of Taunt can prevent Gigalith from setting up Stealth Rock. Examples of this include Misdreavus and Grumpig.  Pokemon that can break its Sturdy such as Bullet Seed Leafeon can also prevent it from being effective.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Being burned severely cripples Gigalith, lowering its Attack and breaking its Sturdy.</p>",

Stone Edge is Gigalith's Rock-type STAB attack, allowing it to hit Fire- and Flying-types such as Rapidash and Dodrio. Rock Blast can be used over Stone Edge to break Substitutes and Focus Sash from Pokemon such as Kadabra, and it has a more reliable accuracy but is generally weaker than Stone Edge. Superpower hits Steel-types such as Pawniard and Probopass, which resist Rock Blast, as well as nailing Rock-types such as Relicanth harder, at the expense of lowering Gigalith's Attack and Defense. Toxic wears down common switch-ins to Gigalith such as Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 252 EVs in HP maximizes Gigalith's bulk. Maximum investment in Attack allows Gigalith to deal the most damage possible. Sturdy is the preferred ability, as it lets Gigalith take one hit at full HP. Leftovers is the preferred item, as it gives Gigalith passive recovery to take hits longer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep Gigalith healthy, as its bulk allows it to better check Pokemon such as Dodrio and Stoutland; keep in mind that it is easily worn down due to a lack of recovery. Though it doesn't have to be used as a lead, Gigalith can be used early in the game, as its main priority is to set up Stealth Rock.

Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly deter foes from using Defog to clear the field of Stealth Rock. Wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Ursaring and Ninetales appreciate Gigalith's Stealth Rock support to aid them in wearing down their checks and counters.

  "Crustle": {
    "overview": "<p>Crustle has access to Shell Smash, making it a solid Pokemon in the PU metagame by transforming it into a threatening sweeper. Crustle also has access to Sturdy, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, making it a solid hazard-stacking leads in the tier. In addition, it has a strong offensive presence with its access to the EdgeQuake combination, which makes Crustle hard to check because the two moves hit almost all of the tier neutrally, especially when combined with X-Scissor. However, Crustle's typing gives it weaknesses to common types such as Water and Rock while only granting it resistances to Normal- and Poison-type moves. As a result, Crustle has trouble with many threats in the PU metagame, and its weakness to Stealth Rock limits the number of times that Crustle can switch in. Despite Crustle having decent defenses, its poor defensive typing along with its lack of a form of recovery hinder its defensive capabilities. Crustle is also very slow for a sweeper, being outsped by Choice Scarf users such as Simipour and Rotom-F and fast Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask, even at +2. As a suicide lead, Crustle faces competition from other leads in the tier such as Smeargle, Golem, and Rampardos. However, Golem and Rampardos do not have access to Spikes, and Smeargle has little to no offensive presence nor can utilise Custap Berry, giving Crustle a notable niche over all of them in the PU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Blast can be used over Stone Edge in order to gain accuracy, but in general, the loss of power is not appreciated. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon that commonly switch into Crustle, but extra coverage is usually better. A Jolly nature can be run on Shell Smash sets in order to outspeed Electrode after a boost, but generally Crustle appreciates the power that an Adamant nature provides. Endure can be used on the Crustap set in order to get up extra entry hazards against Pokemon that barely 2HKO it such as Rapidash, which would usually result in Crustle only getting up one hazard. However, this costs Crustle a moveslot that it can use for coverage, which is generally better. Defensive Crustle sets can be used, but they are almost always outclassed by other walls in the tier such as specially defensive Golem and physically defensive Relicanth.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Tangela, Quilladin, and Gourgeist-XL can take both Stone Edge and Earthquake from Crustle and put it to sleep or burn it in response. However, Tangela and Quilladin do not appreciate their items being Knocked Off, and they both should watch out for X-Scissor.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Crustle's mediocre Special Defense, strong special attackers like Floatzel and Kadabra can OHKO or 2HKO Crustle with their respective attacks. However, these Pokemon tend to not be as bulky and cannot usually switch into Crustle.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Even with maximum Speed EVs, Crustle is slower than most of the metagame and is even outsped by some Pokemon after a Shell Smash boost, like Choice Scarf Rotom-F and Ninjask. These Pokemon can then OHKO or 2HKO Crustle and prevent it from setting up too many entry hazards. However, they cannot switch into Crustle.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: After Crustle has been weakened, priority users such as Floatzel, Monferno, and Dusknoir can come in and KO it with their priority moves before Crustle can KO them.</p>",

      "Crustap": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a solid way of weakening foes upon switching in, and thanks to Sturdy, Crustle is able to set it reliably. Spikes is another form of entry hazard that can deal more damage to Steel-types and can be used in tandem with Stealth Rock. Stone Edge is a strong STAB move that allows Crustle to take on common hazard removers such as Vullaby and Armaldo. Knock Off is a powerful move that is able to weaken checks to Crustle and other wallbreakers by getting rid of items like Eviolite and Leftovers. Earthquake is able to hit Steel-types like Mawile and Probopass for super effective damage; otherwise, Crustle wouldn't be able to touch them. Finally, X-Scissor can be used to hit Grass-types like Tangela, Quilladin, and Leafeon for extra damage. Otherwise, those Pokemon would be able to easily KO or set up on Crustle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs in Speed ensure that the most entry hazards possible are set by outspeeding opposing Pokemon like Probopass, Relicanth, and Roselia. Maximum EVs in Attack let Crustle keep offensive pressure and deal damage to hazard removers like Vullaby and Swanna. A Jolly nature is used in order to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Golem. The combination of Sturdy and Custap Berry allows Crustle to get up two entry hazards almost all of the time, if need be. If you do not need more entry hazards, Custap Berry can also allow Crustle to deal a lot of damage to the foe with Stone Edge or Knock Off before it faints.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You can use Crustle as a lead, as Stealth Rock and Spikes are more effective when they are set early. Look at your opponent's team before you choose to either set entry hazards (and decide which ones to set) or get off damage on opposing Pokemon instead. For example, if they have three Flying-type Pokemon on their team, it is vital to get up Stealth Rock, but Spikes are unnecessary. If you are facing offense, you may not need to get up Spikes because they usually would not get any crucial KOs that would not be gotten from just Stealth Rock. If the opposing lead is a Golem, it might be better to break Golem's Sturdy rather than set a second hazard. Look out for priority users such as Floatzel and Monferno, as they outprioritize Custap Berry's activation.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Crustle set works best as a suicide lead on hyper offense, as entry hazards can weaken the walls that are typical of balance teams and allow your Pokemon to sweep. Sweepers and wallbreakers like Stoutland, Mawile, and Ninetales appreciate the hazards that Crustle sets. In addition, sweepers like Monferno that appreciate weakening of Flying-types enjoy Crustle's Stealth Rock support, making them great partners. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir work well with Crustle, as they can sometimes prevent the hazards that Crustle sets from being removed. Pawniard and Purugly are also great partners for Crustle, as their ability, Defiant, punishes opposing Defog users.</p>"

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash doubles Crustle's Attack and Speed, turning it into a very threatening late-game sweeper. Stone Edge, being Crustle's strongest STAB move, deals a lot of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake is a solid coverage move that allows Crustle to hit Steel-types such as Pawniard and KO Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Golem after a Shell Smash boost. X-Scissor gains STAB and hits Pokemon such as Tangela that can shrug off Stone Edge and Earthquake after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment along with an Adamant nature is used to make Crustle as powerful as possible, while maximum Speed investment allows Crustle to outspeed Pokemon such as Jumpluff after a Shell Smash boost along with uninvested slower Pokemon like Politoed, Seaking, and Vullaby before a boost. White Herb offsets the Defense and Special Defense drops Crustle suffers from Shell Smash, letting it possibly take a hit from a Choice Scarf user, and allowing it to more comfortably set up on slower Pokemon. Sturdy allows Crustle to take any one hit at full health, giving it an opportunity to set up Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crustle should be saved for mid- or late-game when its checks, including faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom-F and bulkier Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL, have been removed. At this point, it can set up Shell Smash and sweep an opposing team. However, it can also wallbreak early-game. Crustle can be used to check Pokemon such as Stoutland and Ursaring, even taking advantage of them to set up Shell Smash. However, it does not appreciate Superpower or Close Combat and is not a great switch-in for these Normal-types unless you plan on setting up Shell Smash and sweeping right after. Take advantage of more passive Pokemon, such as defensive Altaria and Quilladin without Roar, to set up Shell Smash. However, as long as Crustle maintains Sturdy, it can set up on any Pokemon that it can outspeed and OHKO after a boost. Examples of Pokemon that fit into this category are Choice Band Dodrio, Simisear, and Stoutland. Be wary of opposing Choice Scarf users, as even after a Shell Smash boost, Crustle is outsped by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Rotom-F and Choice Scarf Simipour. Fast Pokemon like Ninjask and Electrode can also outspeed it after a boost. Priority moves like Floatzel's Aqua Jet and Monferno's Mach Punch can easily pick off Crustle as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crustle appreciates wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Cacturne that can break down Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Stunfisk, making it easier for Crustle to sweep. Pokemon such as Roselia and Stunfisk that can use entry hazards make for good partners for Crustle, as hazards are able to weaken checks to Crustle as they switch in. Bulky Grass-types such as Quilladin and Gourgeist-XL are able to take on Water-types such as Floatzel and Ground-types such as Golem, which Crustle struggles with. Memento from Pokemon such as Jumpluff can be helpful to grant easier setup opportunities for Crustle. In order to set up reliably, it is important for Crustle to maintain its Sturdy. As a result, hazard removers like Prinplup, Swanna, and Cryogonal help Crustle by letting it not have to switch into Stealth Rock or Spikes and keep its Sturdy.</p>"

Its poor defensive typing, however, makes it hard for Vanilluxe to find time to set up. It also gets worn down easily due to a lack of recovery, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and Life Orb recoil.</p>",

Frost Breath can deal with Calm Mind users, as it always results in a critical hit, but it comes with lower accuracy.

Signal Beam can be used to nail Grumpig for super effective damage, which can switch in on Ice Beam or Freeze-Dry with relative ease due to Thick Fat.

Freeze-Dry, though it is weaker than Ice Beam, provides coverage against Water-types such as Politoed and Simipour. Hidden Power Ground allows Vanilluxe to hit Steel- and Fire-types such as Pawniard and Rapidash, which resist both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry. Alternatively, Flash Cannon allows Vanilluxe to hit other Ice-types, especially Cryogonal, which would otherwise give it problems.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Vanilluxe's Special Attack stat, allowing it do deal the most damage it can. 252 Speed EVs allow Vanilluxe to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after an Autotomize boost. The rest of the EVs go into Defense rather than HP to lower entry hazard damage. Life Orb is the preferred item to boost the power of Vanilluxe's attacks at the cost of some of its health. Weak Armor boosts Vanilluxe's Speed when it is hit by a physical attack, which can help it outspeed and KO an otherwise faster foe; however, it lowers its Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vanilluxe is best used mid- and late-game when its checks and counters have been KOed or are weak enough for it to take out on its own. Due to its bad defensive typing, Vanilluxe is best brought in after a teammate has fainted or from a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, from Pokemon such as Probopass and Lumineon. Set up Autotomize on Pokemon Vanilluxe can force out, such as Tangela and Pelipper. Vanilluxe should try to avoid switching in when Stealth Rock is on the field, as it is already easily worn down due to Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Probopass, Golem, and Roselia helps Vanilluxe by weakening possible checks. Wallbreakers such as Ursaring and mixed Simipour can wear down the opponent's team, making it easier for Vanilluxe to sweep. The latter can lure in special walls such as Lickilicky and Grumpig and KO them with Low Kick and Knock Off, respectively. Water- and Ground-types such as Politoed, Floatzel, and Stunfisk can handle Fire- and Rock-types for Vanilluxe, while Psychic-types such as Grumpig and Kadabra can handle Fighting-types. Fire- and Steel-types such as Rapidash and Probopass can defeat Ice-types for Vanilluxe if it lacks Flash Cannon, making them good partners. Memento support from Pokemon such as Jumpluff lets Vanilluxe come in and set up Autotomize more easily. Healing Wish support from Mr. Mime and Clefairy gives Vanilluxe a second chance at sweeping. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Armaldo, Vibrava, and Pelipper is greatly appreciated by Vanilluxe, as it is worn down by all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Beartic": {
    "overview": "<p>Beartic has a terrible defensive typing, being a pure Ice-type, but it does have solid offensive capabilities. Beartic sets itself apart from other Ice-types in the tier such as Regice and Rotom-F by being a capable physical rain sweeper that can handle Grass-types for its teammates. However, common Pokemon in PU such as Relicanth limit Beartic's offensive capabilities. On top of that, being weak to Stealth Rock and hampered by Spikes and Toxic Spikes doesn't bode well for Beartic at all. That, combined with its low base 50 Speed, means Beartic has to rely on rain to effectively sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can catch bulkier Pokemon such as Relicanth on the switch, but Beartic doesn't have the moveslot to fit it in. Stone Edge is an option to hit Flying-types such as Vullaby, but they are hit hard by Icicle Crash anyway, especially after a Swords Dance. Beartic can use Rain Dance to support itself, but it doesn't have the moveslot for it. Beartic has access to support moves such as Taunt and Encore, but it doesn't have the space for them. A Choice Band set with Icicle Crash, Superpower, Stone Edge, and Aqua Jet is viable on Beartic outside of rain, as it has immediate power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as defensive Relicanth resist Icicle Crash, take next to no damage from Aqua Jet, and can survive a Superpower and then threaten Beartic with Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Metang and Klang can survive a Superpower and threaten Beartic with Meteor Mash and Gear Grind, respectively. Klang can use Rest to recover lost HP from Superpower and use Sleep Talk to get a possible stat boost from Shift Gear or attack with Gear Grind while it's asleep.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock takes 25% of Beartic's HP every time it switches in, and Spikes and Toxic Spikes cut into its longevity as well. This combined with Life Orb recoil means Beartic can easily be picked off by priority moves such as Monferno's Mach Punch and Floatzel's Aqua Jet. If these moves don't KO Beartic, they will surely put it in range to be KOed next turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Without rain, Beartic is very slow, so any Pokemon that can outspeed Beartic can KO it. Some examples include Raichu, Zebstrika, and Rapidash. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Sawsbuck and Mr. Mime can outspeed Beartic in rain and dish out heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Beartic is crippled by burn, worn down by Toxic, and slowed down by paralysis, so Pokemon with access to Will-O-Wisp, Scald, Toxic, or Thunder Wave can cut into Beartic's offensive capabilities. Examples include Politoed and defensive Misdreavus.</p>",

      "Swift Swim Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Icicle Crash is Beartic's STAB move for hitting Grass-types such as Roselia and Tangela. Superpower hits Water-types such as Simipour and Relicanth, which resist Icicle Crash. It is also Beartic's best move against Avalugg. Aqua Jet hits Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales while also bypassing Beartic's low Speed to pick off weakened foes. Swords Dance boosts Beartic's Attack to incredible levels, allowing Beartic to deal out even more damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs, an Adamant Nature, and Life Orb allow Beartic to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs allow Beartic to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible while Speed tying with +2 Rock Polish Regice in rain. Swift Swim is the preferred ability to take advantage of the rain and make up for Beartic's pitiful Speed. Lum Berry can be used over Life Orb for a one-time chance to recover from status, making it easier for Beartic to set up Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Beartic has average bulk, it is best not to switch it into any attacks due to its bad defensive typing. Rain is a must for Beartic to sweep, so having a consistent weather setter is key. Beartic is also better sweeping once its checks and counters are removed or weak enough for Beartic to take out on its own. Use Swords Dance against Grass-types as they switch out of a predicted Icicle Crash or against defensive Pokemon that will switch in predicting an Icicle Crash, such as Avalugg and Relicanth.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain support from Pokemon such as Volbeat and Electrode allows Beartic to sweep more effectively. Volbeat can also provide Thunder Wave support for Beartic. Other rain setters with access to Swift Swim, such as Golduck and Relicanth, are good partners for Beartic, as they can set up rain and handle Fire-types while Beartic handles Grass-types for them. Relicanth also has access to Stealth Rock, providing even more support. Grass-types such as Tangela and Simisage are good partners for Beartic, as they handle the Water-types that Beartic has trouble getting past. Psychic-types such as Beheeyem and Mr. Mime are good partners for Beartic, as they can handle Fighting-types for Beartic. Mr. Mime can also provide Healing Wish support to give Beartic a second chance at sweeping. Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika make for good partners, as they aid in getting rid of Water-types with Thunder, which has perfect accuracy in rain. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Relicanth helps Beartic sweep better. For example, after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage, Beartic is able to OHKO defensive Relicanth and Avalugg with Superpower.</p>"

  "Cryogonal": {
    "overview": "<p>Cryogonal is the most reliable Rapid Spin user in the tier. Its solid Speed tier and Special Attack give it solid offensive presence, and Levitate grants it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, making it far easier to remove them. Cryogonal also has great natural Special Defense, allowing it to check many threatening special attackers such as Floatzel and Electrode and making it one of the best offensive checks to Rotom-F. However, Cryogonal's very poor physical bulk leaves it easily threatened or forced out by even weak physical moves and somewhat vulnerable to Pursuit. Additionally, its weakness to Stealth Rock makes Cryogonal fairly easy to chip away at.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A spread of 40 Def / 216 SpA / 228 Spe allows Cryogonal to survive a single Sucker Punch from Pawniard at full health and OHKO with Hidden Power Fighting while still outspeeding Simipour, Simisear, and Simisage. Toxic or Knock Off can annoy switch-ins such as Audino, Grumpig, Misdreavus, and Metang, although they leave Cryogonal totally walled by Pawniard and Probopass. Life Orb and Never-Melt Ice increase Cryogonal's attacking power to make it more of an offensive threat, but Life Orb can wear it down in conjunction with Stealth Rock, and Never-Melt Ice does not provide a significant damage increase. Explosion can be used on Life Orb sets to lure in and cripple or KO foes such as Grumpig and opposing Cryogonal. Hidden Power Ground threatens Fire-type switch-ins but leaves Cryogonal unable to hit Rotom-F. A spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe can focus more on Cryogonal's bulk rather than its attacking power to be a more reliable spinner but leaves it fairly weak and easy to check. Ice Beam hits slightly harder than Freeze-Dry, but it is generally not worth missing out on threatening Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Cryogonal can do little to damage opposing Fire-types like Rapidash and Camerupt, and it is OHKOed or 2HKOed by all Fire-types' STAB attacks. Additionally, Simisear and Ninetales can use Cryogonal as fodder to set up Nasty Plot before KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Both Monferno and Combusken can switch into Freeze-Dry multiple times and KO Cryogonal with Close Combat or Focus Blast, respectively. Monferno can also set up Swords Dance on Cryogonal or pivot on it with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Cryogonal's paper-thin physical bulk leaves it OHKOed or 2HKOed by all but the weakest physically attacking defensive walls. This makes it forced out by a large number of physical attackers that outspeed it or can survive a Freeze-Dry, such as Stoutland, Arbok, and Metang. Many physical attackers such as Stoutland and Dusknoir can also threaten to Pursuit trap Cryogonal.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Cryogonal's middling power leaves it walled by foes such as Grumpig, Metang, Tank Regice, and Audino, which can cripple Cryogonal with Thunder Wave or Toxic or force it out with Focus Blast or Meteor Mash.</p>",

      "Offensive Rapid Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry is Cryogonal's STAB move of choice, as it allows Cryogonal to threaten Water-types more effectively. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards to support Cryogonal's teammates, and Recover keeps Cryogonal healthy over longer games where it has to switch into Stealth Rock multiple times. Hidden Power Fighting hits opposing Steel- and Ice-types, in particular OHKOing Pawniard on the switch in and breaking Rotom-F's Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Cryogonal to outspeed everything up to base 101 Speed Pokemon including Simipour and Speed tie with Kadabra running Hidden Power Fighting. Maximum Special Attack gives Cryogonal increased offensive presence to have more time to Rapid Spin, while Leftovers grants Cryogonal passive recovery to help with switching into Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cryogonal should remove entry hazards as quickly as possible to avoid its teammates being weakened. However, if the opponent has a Ghost-type, beware of using Rapid Spin and giving it a free switch in, as it also blocks the entry hazard removal. In particular, be wary of Dusknoir, as it can Pursuit trap Cryogonal for most of its health, so Cryogonal should often double switch to avoid being trapped. Cryogonal can sacrifice itself to remove entry hazards if necessary. Cryogonal is extremely physically frail, and it should avoid all physical attackers if possible. While it is a good check to many special attackers, watch out for coverage moves or sets that can eliminate it such as Psyshock Mr. Mime, Superpower Simipour, and physical Floatzel. Use Recover to stay healthy over long matches, as Cryogonal will often need to switch into Stealth Rock multiple times.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Rapidash and passive teams that need a way to keep Spikes off the field appreciate Cryogonal's entry hazard removal. However, Cryogonal is not an ideal entry hazard remover for teams with too many Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, as they can put a lot of pressure on it and stack Rock weaknesses. Physical walls such as Tangela are useful for Cryogonal to fall back on when it's forced out by physical attackers such as Stoutland. Fire- and Fighting-types checks such as Gabite, Altaria, and Grumpig help to check Cryogonal's main weaknesses, while Zebstrika and Electrode appreciate having a teammate that can switch into and threaten Stunfisk easily. Physical Floatzel is a useful offensive partner, as it can threaten Fire-types for Cryogonal while Cryogonal checks Grass-types and Vullaby.</p>"

  "Meowstic": {
    "overview": "<p>Meowstic-M has a niche as the best dual screens setter in the tier thanks to Prankster, which is great for supporting setup sweepers and hyper offense teams. However, while it is not terrible, Meowstic-M's bulk is not the best either, and Taunt stops it from doing its job. Finally, Defoggers can remove the screens that Meowstic-M sets up in the blink of an eye.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A weather support set is a possibility, but it faces competition from Volbeat, which is better suited to the role thanks to its access to U-turn and Encore. Meowstic-M can also attempt a Substitute + Calm Mind set, but is held back by its poor stats and competition from better offensive Psychic-types such as Grumpig. Heal Bell cures status conditions for your team, but it makes Meowstic-M even more vulnerable to Taunt. Toxic hinders the longevity of walls, but for Meowstic-M, the effects of Yawn or Thunder Wave are generally more useful. Safeguard protects the team from status, but its short duration makes it not worth the moveslot. Finally, using Trick and a detrimental item can be a nice surprise, but Meowstic-M would rather carry an item to assist with its team support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Simipour and Encore users such as Audino prevent Meowstic from setting up one or both screens. However, due the fact that Meowstic-M will usually be able to act first, it will  still be able to get up at least one screen in the face of a Taunt or Encore user.</p> <p><strong>Defog Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Swanna and Vullaby can remove dual screens by using Defog. Additionally, Vullaby is immune to Meowstic-M's STAB moves and sometimes runs Knock Off, which removes Meowstic-M's Light Clay, making its screens less effective.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Mightyena are troublesome for Meowstic-M, as their STAB moves are super effective on it, and it cannot damage them, even if it runs Psychic. Meowstic-M still can, however, cripple them with Thunder Wave or force them out with Yawn.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Meowstic-M has problems facing Substitute users such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, as Meowstic-M's STAB moves do not deal much damage when Special Attack is not invested in. Attackers behind a Substitute are immune to Meowstic-M's status moves and can stall out screen turns or set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Reflect and Light Screen support gives Meowstic-M and its teammates an easier time taking attacks, which is ideal for setup sweepers and hyper offense teams. Yawn is used for its ability to force switches, which can provide opportunities for Meowstic-M to set up screens. Thunder Wave cripples offensive foes by inflicting paralysis on them. This is particularly useful for slowing a fast attacker that would otherwise trouble the team. Psychic is Meowstic-M's means of doing some damage, and running it ensures that Meowstic-M is not complete Taunt fodder. Psyshock can be chosen to hit certain targets with lower Defense stats harder, such as Raichu and Ninetales, but Psychic's greater Base Power makes it the preferable choice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP and Defense EVs are maximized for providing Meowstic-M with optimum physical bulk. A Bold nature allows Meowstic-M to take physical hits better. Light Clay extends the duration of Meowstic-M's screens to eight turns, giving the team as much time as possible to utilize them. Prankster is the reason to use Meowstic-M, as it gives priority to Meowstic-M's screens and status-inflicting moves. Meowstic-M can opt for a specially defensive EV spread and a Calm nature in order to do better in the face of specially offensive threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meowstic-M should prioritize setting up its screens unless it is up against an attacker that could prove problematic for your team, in which case Meowstic-M should use Thunder Wave or Yawn. Reflect is best used first when Meowstic-M is against a physically offensive foe or you expect one to switch in; likewise, Light Screen is best used first in the case of a special attacker. If you are running Yawn, you can use it to force a switch and set up a screen as the foe switches out. Yawn can also be useful for forcing out a foe to give yourself the free turn needed to switch in a teammate safely, and, should the foe stay in and fall asleep, Meowstic-M's teammate has an opportunity to set up. Because Meowstic-M's teammates should take advantage of dual screens straight away, it should generally be switched out after it has set up screens. This preserves Meowstic-M and grants it the opportunity to set up its screens at a later point in the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hyper offense teams tend to be on the frailer side, so dual screen support is great for them. Frailer setup sweepers will be able to set up with far greater ease when behind screens. Examples of these are Fraxure, Simipour, Monferno, and Raichu. Purugly and Pawniard are great teammates, as they can use their Defiant ability to switch in on and take advantage of any Defogs aimed at Meowstic-M should the foe risk using it.</p>"

Its access to Defog and U-turn lets it function as a decent entry hazard remover for offensive and defensive teams alike. It has a resistance to Stealth Rock and an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, giving it a niche over other hazard removers such as Pelipper and Swanna. It also has reliable recovery in Roost. However, Vibrava is still a very passive Pokemon that is easily set up on and otherwise taken advantage of. Its extremely low uninvested physical bulk also means that it has trouble taking hits from a lot of common Pokemon in the PU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vibrava has the option of using a more specially defensive spread in order to check Pokemon such as Ninetales and Probopass more easily. Tailwind is a possible option for giving Vibrava's teammates a boost in Speed for a few turns. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Tangela and Grumpig, but Vibrava struggles to find room for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Vibrava's bulk is poor, so most strong attackers which have a neutral type matchup such as Stoutland, Ursaring, and Dodrio, can beat it with little effort.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Hidden Power Ice variants of Zebstrika can surprise Vibrava and prevent it from doing its job. Additionally, while Vibrava has a decent matchup against most special attackers, Ice-types such as Regice and Rotom-F can easily get past it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Vibrava is easy setup fodder for sweepers such as Rain Dance Golduck and Swords Dance Jumpluff, as it cannot do much damage to them and can only U-turn into a check.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: While Vibrava doesn't mind entry hazards at all, wearing it down quickly with attacks is a good way to keep it from removing hazards or having a chance to Roost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog provides helpful support to Vibrava's team by removing entry hazards. U-turn lets Vibrava maintain momentum, and Roost lets Vibrava keep itself healthy. Earthquake lets Vibrava hurt some of the Pokemon it walls, such as Zebstrika, though it is rarely used, as most of the time pivoting out with U-turn is the better option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A physically defensive spread is used to take on physical attackers such as Monferno and Golem. Eviolite boosts Vibrava's defenses to a usable level.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Vibrava into something it walls, such as Monferno or Stunfisk, then use Defog if you need entry hazards gone; otherwise, most of the time Vibrava should be using U-turn so as not to give opponents free turns. Don't be afraid to sacrifice Vibrava in order to clear entry hazards, but if your opponent has a Pokemon that Vibrava can easily switch into it is usually best to save it. In some situations, even when entry hazards are up, U-turn is the safer play, as Vibrava is easily set up on and relies on momentum to be a worthwhile member of its team. Use Roost when Vibrava is low on health and will be useful later in the match. Avoid switching Vibrava into strong attackers such as Ursaring and Stoutland, as it lacks good bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vibrava is mainly only worth using alongside Pokemon that desperately need Stealth Rock gone in order to function properly. This includes Pokemon such as Articuno, Rock Polish Regice, and Life Orb Ninetales. On bulkier teams, pair Vibrava with physical walls such as Tangela. Ninjask especially appreciates Vibrava's support, as it needs Stealth Rock off the field at all times, and Vibrava can easily Defog on Pokemon, such as Probopass, that switch into Ninjask's U-turn. Additionally, Ninjask works best on VoltTurn teams, which are a good fit for Vibrava because of its access to U-turn. Vibrava fits on both offensive and bulky teams because of its bulk, typing, and access to U-turn. Teams that need a check to Zebstrika and also have multiple Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock or otherwise worn down easily by entry hazards are also a decent fit for Vibrava. Pokemon that can deal with setup sweepers, including Kadabra, and Choice Scarf Mr. Mime are all good partners in case Vibrava is set up on. Pokemon that like being paired with a slow U-turn user are good teammates for Vibrava; examples include Ursaring and Rapidash. Pokemon that can handle Ice-types and other common switch-ins to Vibrava make for good partners.</p>"

  "Leafeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Leafeon is the strongest physical Grass-type attacker in PU, and it is fairly hard to switch into with hard-hitting sets such as Swords Dance and Choice Band as well as good coverage in Knock Off. It also has decent defenses to check a number of weaker threats in the tier and set up Swords Dance fairly reliably. However, Leafeon is held back by its mediocre Speed and poor defensive typing, making it fairly easy to revenge kill, and it faces competition from the large number of viable Grass-types, most notably Jumpluff, which sports far better Speed and a fantastic support movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>When Leafeon is run on sun teams, it is best used similarly to the Swords Dance set, but it should use an Adamant nature and hold a Life Orb to deal maximum damage. Leafeon can also run Sunny Day instead of Return in order to boost both its Attack and Speed on the Swords Dance set at the cost of Return's neutral coverage. Iron Tail or Double-Edge can be used on the Choice Band set to deal more damage to Avalugg, Jumpluff, and Vullaby. Double-Edge is also a possibility over Return to guarantee the OHKO on defensive Roselia after a Swords Dance, but the recoil damage can chip away at Leafeon, putting it in range of revenge killers such as Choice Specs Floatzel. Natural Gift + Charti Berry can be used on the Swords Dance set to hit the same threats, but Leafeon will miss its resist Berry. Leafeon can use an Occa Berry to avoid being revenge killed by Overheat Zebstrika and Simisear, but Yache Berry handles a greater amount of foes. Rock Smash is another option that allows Leafeon to lure and OHKO Pawniard. Leafeon can fit Quick Attack or X-Scissor on the Swords Dance set as well as the Choice Band set, but it loses out on being able to pass boosts. It can also run a different offensive item such as Life Orb or Meadow Plate, but, again, it prefers a resist Berry. Defensive sets are also somewhat viable thanks to Leafeon's good support moves, such as Synthesis and Yawn, but they are generally outclassed by by the likes of Tangela and Roselia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Dodrio and Swanna can simply outspeed and OHKO Leafeon with Brave Bird and Hurricane respectively. Vullaby also resists both of Leafeon's main attacking moves and threatens it with Foul Play, and Jumpluff threatens Leafeon with its super effective STAB moves and takes very little damage from Knock Off thanks to its lack of an item.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Faster Fire-types threaten to OHKO Leafeon lacking Occa Berry. Monferno can check an unboosted Leafeon or pivot into the Choice Band set, but will fall to a +2 Return after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Burn prevents Leafeon from wallbreaking effectively, and paralysis slows it down so that it can be more easily handled by bulkier teams. While poison is not as detrimental, it still wears Leafeon down quickly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Most offensive Pokemon in the tier are capable of dealing heavy damage to Leafeon with super effective coverage moves, making it easy to revenge kill. Although Leafeon can lure in certain threats such as Zebstrika and Simipour and defeat them with the help of the correct resist Berry, other Pokemon, such as Dodrio, are always capable of OHKOing Leafeon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance assists Leafeon in breaking down bulkier teams, while Leaf Blade functions as its main STAB attack. Knock Off is its best coverage move and can remove Eviolite from a lot of Leafeon's most common switch-ins, such as Vullaby and Tangela. Return is Leafeon's best neutral coverage, acting as Leafeon's strongest attack versus foes such as Monferno, Vullaby, Roselia, and Jumpluff. Double-Edge is an option over Return as it can guarantee the 2HKO on Vullaby after Stealth Rock at +2 at the expense of taking recoil damage in the process.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment alongside a Jolly nature helps Leafeon outspeed and KO as many threats as possible. Chlorophyll is mostly a filler ability, but it allows Leafeon to check opposing sun teams. Yache Berry is critical to prevent Leafeon from easily being revenge killed by faster Water-types with Ice Beam such as Simipour.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leafeon can either set up a Swords Dance early-game to weaken teams for its teammates to have an easier time sweeping or wait until late-game to sweep itself. Using Knock Off early-game helps cripple opposing teams by removing items. Leafeon can switch into weaker physical attackers lacking a super effective move, such as Metang and Gabite, and it also checks Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Golem fairly well. However, it has difficulty switching into other Pokemon and needs to be played with care. Keep in mind that, despite its Yache Berry, Leafeon can still be revenge killed by Choice Scarf Rotom-F's Blizzard after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other strong physical attackers and sweepers, particularly fast ones such as Choice Scarf Dodrio or ones which can boost their Speed such as Fraxure, can benefit from Leafeon's wallbreaking prowess and ability to remove Eviolites with Knock Off. Checks to Fire-, Water-, and Flying-types such as Grumpig, Politoed, and Klang, respectively, are essential, as these foes will often come in to revenge kill Leafeon. Pokemon that can threaten Vullaby, such as Probopass and Electric-types such as Rotom-F, are also appreciated, as Vullaby can easily wall Leafeon and pressure Swords Dance recipients with Foul Play. Lures such as Dazzling Gleam Kadabra can accomplish this as well. Entry hazard setters such as Gabite and Roselia can help wear down Leafeon's switch-ins such as Tangela with Spikes and Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Blade is Leafeon's main STAB move, as it is its strongest move and has perfect accuracy. Knock Off is a decent coverage move that allows Leafeon to hit common Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Beheeyem and Gourgeist-XL, and it is generally useful for removing the opposing Pokemon's items such as Eviolite and Leftovers. Double-Edge provides neutral coverage on most targets that resist Grass- and Dark-type moves, such as Monferno and Vullaby, and it is even more effective when these Pokemon have already been hit with Knock Off. Return is an alternative to Double-Edge, as it does not inflict recoil at the cost of less power; however, it is important to note that Return does not 2HKO Monferno on the switch, while Double-Edge has a 93% chance to 2HKO. The final moveslot is primarily up to team structure and preference; X-Scissor helps against Grass-types such as opposing Leafeon and Cacturne while Bullet Seed is an option to bypass Sturdy and Focus Sash users such as Golem and Smeargle. Rock Smash is also worth mentioning as a filler move if none of the other moves are needed due to the fact that it hits Pawniard super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment enables Leafeon to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf allows Leafeon to outspeed the tier's most common Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-F, Mr. Mime, and Chatot, as well as Pokemon in a higher Speed tier, such as Floatzel and Zebstrika. Chlorophyll is mostly an irrelevant ability, but it can be useful against opposing sun teams. Leaf Guard is used only if Bullet Seed is used as well because Chlorophyll is illegal in conjunction with Bullet Seed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Leafeon to threaten and revenge kill fast(er) threats, such as Floatzel, Choice Scarf Mr. Mime, Choice Scarf Chatot, and other relatively frail offensive Pokemon. Leafeon is best used in the mid-game and late-game, primarily because it can clean late-game once its checks and counters have been weakened or removed. Leafeon can also be used somewhat in the early game, bypassing dedicated leads such as Golem, Relicanth, and Focus Sash Smeargle with the use of Bullet Seed provided it gets three or more hits. Furthermore, using Knock Off in the early-game can cripple or weaken Pokemon that depend on their item, paving the way for a teammate to benefit later on. For example, removing Monferno's Eviolite makes it more easily beaten by Double-Edge later on in the match, and removing Altaria's Leftovers early on gets rid of its passive recovery, forcing it to Roost more often and lose momentum. Even though Leafeon can be a good switch-in to some attacks that it resists early on, it should do so with caution to avoid getting worn down too quickly because it may need its health later on in the match to tank a hit. Additionally, although Leafeon has good physical bulk, it has mediocre special bulk, and thus it should not be switched in carelessly into special attacks, even if it resists them. Leafeon should also be careful of attempting to revenge kill Pokemon that it cannot OHKO, as it risks taking unnecessary damage back. Leafeon can click Knock Off or Leaf Blade fairly liberally, as they have few drawbacks. However, it is important to not lock Leafeon into an unfavorable move that would allow it to be set up on, such as locking it into Leaf Blade to give Sap Sipper Bouffalant and Swords Dance Monferno a free turn to set up. This can be avoided either by double switching or picking a move that would better prevent the opponent from taking advantage of Leafeon. Finally, remember that all forms of status, especially paralysis and burn, hinder Leafeon's ability to revenge kill and attack effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Leafeon's ability to pressure and KO faster threats are good partners. This includes sweepers such as Ursaring, Ninetales, and Nasty Plot Mr. Mime. Choice Scarf Leafeon can fit nicely on bulkier and more balanced teams in need of speed control, but it also fits on offensive teams in the same manner. Leafeon is a good partner to Pokemon that are checked by Golem, such as Dodrio and Muk, as it can remove it for them. Answers to defensive stops like Mawile, Vullaby, Muk, Tangela, and Monferno are helpful, as Leafeon is unable to break through and clean opposing teams until these Pokemon are removed. Notable examples include Water-types such as Floatzel and Swanna, which threaten the Fire-, Flying- and Grass-type counters, and Ninetales and Rapidash, which threaten the Grass- and Steel-type counters. Misdreavus is a nice teammate due to its ability to cripple Fire-type checks with Thunder Wave, making them easier to deal with. Misdreavus counters and weakens opposing Bouffalant that try to prevent Leafeon from spamming Leaf Blade. It also weakens Leafeon's typical counters like Mawile, Vullaby, and Altaria with moves like Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Dazzling Gleam. Camerupt is another good partner, since it switches into Electric-type checks such as Zebstrika and Rotom-F, while Leafeon can handle Ground- and Water-type moves for Camerupt; Choice Specs Camerupt can even lure Altaria for Leafeon and remove it with Hidden Power Ice and generally puts a lot of offensive pressure on opposing walls. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Probopass, Golem, and specially defensive Clefairy is very helpful for Leafeon, as it limits Flying- and Fire-type checks and counters and allows Leafeon to net some important KOs, such as OHKOing Mr. Mime, which would otherwise survive one Leaf Blade from full HP.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Seed allows Leafeon to OHKO Sturdy Golem and Focus Sash Kadabra and hit through Substitutes from Pokemon such as Rotom-F. Leaf Blade gives Leafeon a more reliable STAB option, while Knock Off is its best coverage option and provides utility by removing items. In the final slot, Double Edge can be used to hit Monferno and other Grass resists harder, whereas Quick Attack can be used as a last-ditch priority attack despite being somewhat weak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment lets Leafeon wallbreak as effectively as possible. Choice Band further augments Leafeon's Attack. An Adamant nature is preferred, as Leafeon outspeeds very few extra Pokemon with a Jolly nature and appreciates the significant boost to its Attack. Leaf Guard must be used, as Bullet Seed and Chlorophyll are incompatible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leafeon should be used early-game to soften up opposing defensive cores. Using Knock Off can also help cripple opposing teams by removing items. Leafeon can check weaker physical attackers but normally needs to be brought in with a double switch or a free switch due to its mediocre bulk. Beware of locking Leafeon into Leaf Blade or Bullet Seed when facing teams with Bouffalant, as Grass-type moves provide a free boost for it thanks to Sap Sipper. When facing teams with a suicide Stealth Rock setter, such as Rampardos or Golem, Leafeon can prevent it from setting up entry hazards by KOing it through Focus Sash or Sturdy with Bullet Seed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers such as Pawniard and Monferno appreciate Leafeon's wallbreaking capabilities, although they provide little defensive synergy. Leafeon also needs teammates like Roselia, Ninetales, and Relicanth, which can switch into Water-, Fire-, and Flying-type attackers that can revenge kill it with ease. Stunfisk is a notable partner for also checking Flying-types, setting up Stealth Rock to assist Leafeon in wearing down opposing teams, and even luring Water-types if running Passho Berry. Checks to Vullaby, such as Raichu, are also needed, as Leafeon is incapable of doing any significant damage to it. Although somewhat rare, clerics such as Grumpig can help keep Leafeon free of status conditions to help it continue wallbreaking. Slow pivots such as Probopass and Pelipper, while not entirely necessary, can help Leafeon switch in more easily.</p>"

  "Glaceon": {
    "overview": "<p>Glaceon has a powerful base 130 Special Attack which distinguishes it from other Ice-type Pokemon such as Articuno and Lapras. As a specially attacking Ice-type Pokemon, it receives competition from Regice, which has far better coverage and access to Rock Polish, and Rotom-F, which has a secondary STAB, but sets itself apart as an even stronger wallbreaker. Glaceon can take on most of the Grass- and Flying-types in the tier such as Tangela, Roselia, and Vullaby. It also has decent bulk, granting it the ability to take a few hits, which can partially counteract its low Speed. Unfortunately, Glaceon has a shallow movepool, which gives it very limited options to deal with Pokemon that resist its Ice-type STAB moves. A weakness to Stealth Rock, susceptibility to all entry hazards, and slowness all contribute to wearing Glaceon down quickly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with moves such as Wish, Heal Bell, and Roar might seem appealing at first, but Glaceon suffers from a low HP stat and a poor defensive typing that leaves it with only one resistance and various weaknesses. A Choice Scarf set might seem viable as well, but it is outclassed by Rotom-F, which has higher Speed, a secondary STAB type in Electric, and access to Trick to disrupt bulky walls. Glaceon can also utilize Never-Melt Ice to feign a Choice item and surprise Pokemon such as Probopass and Grumpig. Hyper Voice provides decent coverage, as it hits everything but Steel- and Ghost-type Pokemon neutrally, but it is fairly weak without a STAB boost. Glaceon could run Toxic to break down walls, but Toxic cannot hurt Steel-types and makes Glaceon lose the offensive presence that it needs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon, such as Monferno and Rapidash, can use their STAB moves to defeat Glaceon. Ninetales in particular has Nasty Plot and may use Glaceon to set up, while Rapidash could use Morning Sun to recover its health.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Cryogonal and Regice shrug off Ice Beam and may set up or use alternative coverage moves to take down Glaceon, while Rotom-F can Volt Switch to preserve momentum, but they have to watch out for Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Probopass and Klang can switch in on Glaceon's Ice Beam and fire back with a Steel-type move. Glaceon can take them on, however, if it uses Hidden Power Fighting, but it has to predict their switch in.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards can severely hamper Glaceon's performance, as they can break it down quicker and prevent it from switching into foes.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Glaceon can be checked by foes such as Floatzel and Simipour, which can survive a single Ice Beam and 2HKO Glaceon with their STAB attacks. Huntail can survive a single hit and set up a Shell Smash before OHKOing Glaceon.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Glaceon has mediocre Speed and is prone to be revenge killed by Pokemon such as Ninetales, Simipour, Dodrio, and Stoutland.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam has a high Base Power, perfect accuracy, and a STAB boost, making it easy to use continually. Ice Beam can also deal solid damage against frail Steel- or Water-types such as Pawniard and Simipour, respectively. Hidden Power Fighting hits the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Ice Beam such as Probopass and Pawniard, as well as opposing Ice-types. Shadow Ball mostly provides coverage, and it has the benefit of hitting Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Psychic-types such as Grumpig and Metang for super effective damage, as well as hitting Water-types neutrally. Frost Breath allows Glaceon to break through Calm Mind users such as Duosion, but is otherwise only just as strong as Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Glaceon's abilities don't assist it outside of hail and are otherwise useless. Choice Specs allows Glaceon to wallbreak effectively with its sheer power but locks it into a singular move. The EVs maximize Glaceon's Special Attack while giving it the ability to outrun many walls such as Grumpig and Misdreavus. A Modest nature carries powerful strength behind it, allowing Glaceon to 2HKO Audino after Stealth Rock damage. However, a Timid nature may be used in order to outspeed targets that fall in the threshold between maximum Speed base 65 Pokemon with a boosted nature to base 104 Speed Pokemon without any investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Glaceon by pivoting to it with slow Volt Switches, U-turns, or after a teammate has fainted. Glaceon immediately threatens Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Roselia; as such, it can take advantage of their presence in order to attack. Continuously use Ice Beam against foes that don't resist it, and utilize Hidden Power Fighting to beat Steel-, Ice-, or and Rock-types on a predicted switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is crucial for Glaceon to be able to come in continually. Vibrava offers good type synergy with Glaceon, as it resists Fire and Rock and may remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Fighting-types are quite helpful, as they have great type synergy with Glaceon and can beat many relevant Stealth Rock users. In particular, Monferno is a great partner for Glaceon, as it can take on Pawniard, get chip damage on Grumpig with U-turn, and chip away at Water-types. Huntail can take advantage of Glaceon's ability to blast through Grass-types and get chip damage on Water-types to clean the opposing team more easily. Pokemon that are able to take hits from and deal with threatening Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour are effective partners for Glaceon; examples include Tangela and Politoed. Leavanny is able to provide Sticky Web support for Glaceon, which can allow it to outspeed opposing Pokemon such as Kadabra and Rapidash.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gourgeist-S has great Speed for a physical wall, allowing it to outspeed and burn opposing physical Pokemon such as Basculin and Fraxure. It has a fantastic utility movepool including Leech Seed, Will-O-Wisp, Substitute, and Disable. Its ability, Frisk, allows it to scout opponents' items. It has a good defensive typing that grants it many useful resistances to common types such as Electric, Water, Grass, and Ground. Its typing also gives Gourgeist-S an immunity to Fighting- and Normal-type moves. This allows it to effectively wall Pokemon such as Basculin and Raichu while also allowing it to become a spinblocker. However Gourgeist-S has difficulty with Grass- and Fire-types, which is a problem with the popularity of Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Ninetales.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Sneak can be used as a form of priority; however, Gourgeist-S struggles to find room for it. Protect can be used over Substitute to scout for moves; however, the utility Substitute provides is much better. Phantom Force can be used to get an extra turn of Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery. Seed Bomb or Bullet Seed can be used over one of the suggested attacking moves above; however, Rock Slide provides better coverage and Phantom Force provides extra turns of Leech Seed recovery. Pain Split can be used to get back more health for Gourgeist-S, but it is not reliable. Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp as a quicker way to wear down opposing Pokemon; however, the utility Will-O-Wisp provides is much better. An offensive Gourgeist-S can be used, but it isn't very strong.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales, Rapidash, and Simisear force Gourgeist-S out with their powerful Fire-type moves. They are also immune to Will-O-Wisp, and some of them, such as the aforementioned Pokemon, even get a Flash Fire boost from it. A Fire-type's best way to switch in is on a predicted Will-O-Wisp; however, Fire-types have to be wary of switching into a super effective Rock Slide. Ice-type Pokemon such as Rotom-F, Regice, and Articuno threaten Gourgeist-S out with powerful Ice-type moves. While Ice-types struggle to switch in, if they come in on a Will-O-Wisp or a Leech Seed they can force out Gourgeist-S with an Ice Beam, but if they switch in on a Gourgeist-S with Substitute up then they will be hit by a super effective Rock Slide. Articuno has to be especially wary of Rock Slide as it is 4x weak to Rock. Flying-types such as Dodrio, Swanna, and Pelipper force Gourgeist-S out with their super effective STAB Flying-type moves. However, Flying-types have to be wary of switching into a super effective Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Substitute-using Grass-types such as Gogoat and Simisage are immune to Leech Seed and can set up on Gourgeist-S.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is detrimental to Gourgeist-S as it is super effective, removes Gourgeist-S's Leftovers, and can limit the number of Substitutes it can make. Gourgeist-S has to be wary of switching in and trying to wall Pokemon such as Pawniard, Leafeon, and Krokorok that commonly carry Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status such as Toxic, Toxic Spikes, and Scald burns can limit the number of Substitutes Gourgeist-S can make. Gourgeist-S likes to switch in on common defensive Pokemon such as Pelipper, Probopass, and Golem to try and get up a free Substitute; however, the aforementioned Pokemon commonly carry Toxic, and they can cripple Gourgeist-S by poisoning it on the switch. Gourgeist-S should be wary of switching into Thunder Wave from Pokemon it's trying to wall, such as Stunfisk. If Gourgeist-S gets paralyzed then it loses one of its biggest assets, its Speed. Gourgeist-S relies on its ability to outspeed opposing Pokemon to get off a Leech Seed and set up Substitutes.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Grumpig can shut down Gourgeist-S, stopping it from using Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp, but they struggle to switch in, as some of them are outsped, and risk getting statused first.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute can completely block status and Leech Seed and allows other bulky Pokemon to set up on Gourgeist-S.</p>",

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is used to protect against weaker attacks and status, and can also be used to scout for what an opponent wants to do. Gourgeist-S can set up Substitutes on the various Pokemon it walls, allowing it to use Leech Seed on or burn the switch-in, wearing it down, especially if Gourgeist-S is faster and can continually set up Substitutes. Leech Seed is used for extra recovery, allowing Gourgeist-S to set up more Substitutes, and Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers such as Leafeon, Fraxure, and Dodrio and to provide residual damage on common switch-ins such as Grass-, Ice-, and Flying-types. Rock Slide is used to hit common Fire- and Flying-types, which like to switch into Gourgeist-S, from behind the safety of a Substitute. Disable can be used instead of Rock Slide to stall by disabling super effective moves. Foul Play is a reliable offensive move that uses the foe's Attack stat, which is a benefit as Gourgeist-S has a mediocre Attack itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment is used so that Gourgeist-S can outspeed as many threats as possible, such as Frogadier, Swanna, and Basculin. The HP EVs allow Gourgeist-S to get as much HP from Leech Seed and Leftovers as possible, and the rest are put in Defense for added bulk. Frisk is used to scout an opponent's item, letting you see Choice items and other less obvious items, giving insight into the opponent's set. Leftovers is used for increased longevity, allowing Gourgeist-S to set up multiple Substitutes. While a Jolly nature is recommended if Gourgeist-S is carrying Rock Slide, a Timid nature is best when Disable or Foul Play are used for reduced damage from opposing Foul Play users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be wary of switching into a Scald, because while resisted, burn limits the number of Substitutes Gourgeist-S can set up. Set up Substitutes on status users or Pokemon with resisted STAB attacks. After setting up Substitute, use Leech Seed on and then burn specially based Pokemon, and do the reverse on physically based Pokemon. Setting up a Substitute when the opponent has a Grass-type is not the best idea as it only wastes precious health which can be difficult to recover without the help of Leech Seed. If Gourgeist-S is running Disable, first use Substitute to see what move the opponent will go for to hurt Gourgeist-S, then Disable the move and Substitute again to see if they carry any coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes users such as Roselia are useful teammates, as the Toxic damage coupled with Leech Seed can rack up quickly. Roselia can also switch into Grass-types quite easily. Toxic Spikes users are also helpful because they can absorb Toxic Spikes on your side of the field, which can be detrimental to Gourgeist-S, while Gourgeist-S provides spinblocking support. Entry hazard users in general, such as Golem and Stunfisk, make good teammates, as Gourgeist-S forces a lot of switches and hazard damage racks up quickly. Audino is a good teammate as it can provide Wish and Heal Bell support to Gourgeist-S, while Gourgeist-S can provide a switch-in to Fighting-type attacks. Pokemon that resist Dark-type attacks, such as Combusken and Monferno, are good teammates to take moves such as Knock Off. A Fire / Water / Grass core can be created with Gourgeist-S using Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash as well as Water-types such as Gorebyss and Simipour, as they can take care of each other's weaknesses.</p>"

  "Avalugg": {
    "overview": "<p>Avalugg's access to Rapid Spin allows it to support its team by only removing entry hazards on your side while not removing the hazards you have set up, unlike Defog. Avalugg's colossal Defense, along with its high HP stat, allows it to take almost any physical hit with ease, making it a good check to physical attackers, such as Dodrio and Stoutland. A high Attack stat also allows Avalugg to retaliate after being hit, and even without any Attack investment, Avalugg still deals decent damage. Avalugg's reliable recovery in Recover allows it to function as a tank and use Rapid Spin more often.</p> <p>However, Avalugg's bad defensive typing in Ice grants it many weaknesses and only one resistance, making it vulnerable to many Pokemon. Avalugg's extremely low Speed also makes it very hard to use Rapid Spin effectively, as it usually has to take a hit first. Avalugg's Special Defense is also abysmal, and needs to be invested in to prevent Avalugg from being extremely vulnerable to special attacks. Avalugg also lacks a reliable Ice-type STAB move and has to rely on Avalanche, which requires the opponent to hit Avalugg for any decent damage to be done. Avalugg's weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to Spikes and Toxic Spikes detracts from its role as a spinner, and it also fails to get past most Ghost-types that try to block Rapid Spin. Avalugg is a decent spinner in the tier due to it being the bulkiest one with actual offensive presence, and should be considered for any hazard-weak team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While using an offensive tank set with three attacks and Recover seems appealing, the loss of Rapid Spin is very detrimental, as it is one of Avalugg's biggest niches. Mirror Coat with Sturdy is an option to gain surprise KOs on special attackers. Lastly, a physically defensive EV spread is not beneficial, as Avalugg will only take about 10% less damage from physical attacks, at the cost of taking about 30% more damage from special attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Most bulky Ghost-types are a problem for Avalugg. Gourgeist-XL can tank any attack from Avalugg and burn it. Misdreavus can burn Avalugg or set up on it. Ghost-types also block Rapid Spin, stopping one of Avalugg's main niches.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: If Avalugg is hit by Taunt, it loses the ability to use Recover, Roar, and Toxic, which makes it harder to function as a wall and forces it to rely on Avalanche and Earthquake if it chooses to stay in; examples of Taunt users include Misdreavus and Grumpig.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Like most walls, Avalugg is easily worn down by burn and poison. Toxic from Pokemon such as Prinplup is especially troublesome for Avalugg, due to its damage stacking up and eventually bringing Avalugg down. Burns from Pokemon such as Misdreavus reduce Avalugg's offensive presence and negate Leftovers recovery. Avalugg is also threatened by common Pokemon that it normally walls but occasionally carry Toxic, such as Audino. Toxic Spikes is also a problem, as it poisons Avalugg while it attempts to spin them away.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick users such as Rotom-F can easily cripple Avalugg with a Choice item, which will lock Avalugg into an undesired move such as Rapid Spin or Recover and will generally render it useless.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Even with Special Defense investment, most special Fire-types, such as Ninetales, can break through Avalugg. Powerful physical Fire-types, such as Swords Dance Monferno and Rapidash, can also heavily dent Avalugg despite its high base Defense. However, Earthquake does hit them very hard.</p>",

      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Unlike Defog, Rapid Spin removes hazards on your side of the field while preserving those that you have set on the opposing side of the field. Recover gives Avalugg a form of recovery, which is ideal for a tank, allowing it to use Rapid Spin more often. Avalanche is Avalugg's main STAB attack, stopping it from being Taunt bait and allowing it to mess with opposing Pokemon that attempt to come in. Earthquake is a coverage move that hits Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-type Pokemon super effectively. Roar allows Avalugg to deal with set up sweepers, forcing them out. However, Toxic is an option in the last slot to cripple opposing walls, such as Prinplup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs maximize Avalugg's bulk, while minimizing the amount of damage Avalugg takes from Stealth Rock. 252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature patch up Avalugg's mediocre Special Defense. While all of Avalugg's abilities are relatively useless, Sturdy guarantees Avalugg one Rapid Spin when it's at full health. Holding a Leftovers provides passive recovery. An Impish nature can be used to increase Avalugg's defense a bit and give more insurance against threats such as Superpower Stoutland and Iron Head Pawniard, but using maximum Defense investment is not recommended, as Avalugg will take only marginally less damage from physical attacks, while taking significantly more damage from special attacks.</p> <p>An alternate spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def with an Adamant nature and a moveset of Rapid Spin, Avalanche, Earthquake or Crunch, and Recover is an option if you'd rather have Avalugg function as an offensive tank with Rapid Spin as a support option. This set could also opt for Crunch over Recover to hit Ghost-type Pokemon that attempt to switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avalugg is best used staying in and using Rapid Spin when it finds the opportunity, such as against physical attackers that can't do much damage to it. Avalugg is very bulky, but it should not be relied on to take special hits. Keeping Avalugg healthy with Recover, which allows it to use Rapid Spin more often, is key to using it properly. The best time to use Recover is when Avalugg is just above 50% of its health, to benefit from Sturdy. Due to Avalugg's insanely high Defense stat, it can check most physical attackers that don't have a super effective STAB move. Lastly, be very careful when using Rapid Spin if the opponent has a Ghost-type, as Ghost-types are able to block Rapid Spin and can potentially burn Avalugg; instead, try wearing them down with Avalanche.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Avalugg works best on teams that rely on entry hazards yet are weak to them, as Defog users are counterproductive on these teams. Pokemon that patch up Avalugg's weaknesses, such as Gabite, make for great partners. Pokemon that benefit from Avalugg's Rapid Spin support, such as Rapidash, Simipour, and Dodrio, all make for great partners. Clerics such as Audino and Grumpig can remove poison and burns, which easily cripple Avalugg. In a similar vein, Poison-types such as Roselia can remove Toxic Spikes, which are usually a problem for Avalugg, while Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales can absorb Will-O-Wisp and break through Ghost-types with their STAB moves. Roselia and Ninetales are also able to take special hits, which threaten Avalugg.</p>"

  "Prinplup": {
    "overview": "<p>Prinplup is a unique Pokemon in PU sporting the combination of Stealth Rock and Defog, allowing it to reliably remove and set entry hazards as well as compressing roles, making Prinplup a solid utility Pokemon. Prinplup also sets itself apart from other Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Camerupt with its resistance to Water- and Ice-type attacks as well as its ability to threaten out said hazard setters with Scald, and it sets itself apart from Lumineon with more bulk and being able to set up hazards as well as removing them, though this comes at the expense of not having a Water immunity and a slow U-turn like Lumineon does. However, a lack of recovery limits the number of times Prinplup can function as an utility Pokemon and means it is easily overwhelmed by offensive pressure from Pokemon such as Stoutland and Ursaring. It is also reliant on Eviolite for tanking hits better, leaving it vulnerable to Knock Off. This combined with the fact that Prinplup is passive at times, especially against Grass-types such as Roselia, means foes can easily force it out or use it as setup fodder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used to nail Grass-types such as Roselia and Tangela, which can come in against Prinplup without trouble, though the damage output is somewhat miniscule without Special Attack investment. A moveset consisting of Stealth Rock, Scald, Ice Beam, and Toxic is also an option if the team already has Defog support. A specially defensive set can be used to better handle Politoed and special variants of Floatzel, as well as Pokemon such as Ninetales. Rest can be used with Heal Bell support to keep Prinplup healthy at the cost of a moveslot. Hidden Power Electric can OHKO Swanna after Stealth Rock damage. Rock Tomb slows down opposing Pokemon and hits Ice-types such as Articuno and Cryogonal super effectively. Alternatively, Icy Wind does more damage to Pokemon such as Fraxure and Altaria while still lowering their Speed. Yawn can be used over Toxic to catch Grass-types such as Leafeon on the switch and force them out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Roselia and Tangela can come in against Prinplup without any trouble and scare it out with their Grass-type STAB attacks, although the latter doesn't want to be poisoned and still takes a decent amount of damage if Prinplup runs Ice Beam. Roselia doesn't mind being burned by Scald and is immune to Toxic and can proceed to scare Prinplup out with Giga Drain or set up a layer of Spikes as Prinplup switches out. More offensively oriented Pokemon such as Simisage and Jumpluff don't want to be burned by Scald, but they can also force Prinplup to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika don't want to switch into a Scald or Toxic, but they can force Prinplup out with Thunderbolt or gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Prinplup is bulky, but because it lacks recovery, it can be overwhelmed by strong attacks from Pokemon such as Stoutland and Ursaring, which limits its effectiveness as a utility Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Prinplup is affected by all forms of entry hazards and lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can easily be worn down.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Pokemon such as Duosion and Clefairy don't mind Scald or Toxic thanks to Magic Guard and can set up a Calm Mind as Prinplup is forced out.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is useful for removing entry hazards from the field, which Prinplup's teammates appreciate. Stealth Rock wears down foes switching in and breaks Sturdy and Focus Sashes. Scald has a 30 percent chance of burning the foe and is useful for crippling physical attackers such as Pawniard, and is its only attacking move. Toxic wears down Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL as well as wearing down Politoed and Lumineon, which are immune to Scald due to their abilities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense, as well as a Bold nature, maximizes Prinplup's physical bulk. Eviolite further boosts its defenses, allowing it to take hits even better. Torrent boosts the power of Prinplup's Scald when its health is low.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prinplup can come in against Pokemon such as Golem and Camerupt as well as on resisted hits such as Metang's Meteor Mash and either remove hazards with Defog or force the aforementioned Pokemon out with Scald. If entry hazards are present on your side of the field and if the opportunity presents itself, Prinplup should use Defog to clear them, but be mindful of using Defog against Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly, which get an Attack boost from it. If entry hazards aren't up, Prinplup can freely set up Stealth Rock if given the chance. Keep Prinplup healthy if it is still needed to use Stealth Rock or Defog, as it can easily be worn down by repeated hits and can't act as a support Pokemon in a weakened state.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Prinplup best fits on balanced teams, where it can function as a utility Pokemon. Pokemon that appreciate hazard removal as well entry hazard support such as Ninjask, Rapidash, Articuno, and Rotom-F make for good partners. These Pokemon also deal with Grass-types that Prinplup struggles with, and Articuno and Rotom-F beat opposing Water-types, while Prinplup can handle Fire-types. Grass-types such as Roselia and Simisage can handle other Grass-types as well as resisting Electric-type attacks for Prinplup. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Camerupt and Lightning Rod Raichu and Zebstrika make for good partners for Prinplup; the former can threaten Grass-types with Fire Blast and provide Stealth Rock support, which will free a moveslot for Prinplup, while the latter two can switch into Electric-type attacks aimed at Prinplup and get a Special Attack boost. Audino makes for a great partner, as it appreciates Prinplup's ability to remove entry hazards while Prinplup appreciates Audino's ability to keep it healthy with Wish and remove status with Heal Bell.</p>"

  "Wartortle": {
    "overview": "<p>Wartortle is mostly outclassed by other Pokemon that can keep entry hazard control, such as Armaldo and Swanna, though Wartortle carries some slight niches that allow it to set itself apart from them, and it can be considered for a teamslot on a defensive team that struggles against entry hazards, even if it's extremely situational. Wartortle is the only spinner in PU that isn't weak to Stealth Rock, though its lack of recovery makes it susceptible to entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, and keeps it from repeatedly being able to use Rapid Spin. Wartortle has good bulk enhanced by Eviolite, which allows it to check various threats and find some opportunities to Rapid Spin or cripple foes with Scald and Toxic. Another niche lies in its access to Foresight, as it allows Wartortle to catch Ghost-types that usually switch in on the probable Rapid Spin, such as Misdreavus, Gourgeist-XL, and Dusknoir, off-guard; however Misdreavus is still able to nullify Wartortle's attempt to use Rapid Spin most of the time because of its access of Taunt, which blocks Foresight, though it can be caught off-guard on the switch in. Unfortunately, Defoggers such as Lumineon and Vullaby are often preferred on defensive teams because they can remove entry hazards more reliably. As a last note, Wartortle relies on Eviolite to keep checking strong attackers, and its mediocre offensive presence makes it setup fodder against Pokemon such as Clefairy, Duosion, and Simipour, making it unviable on most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seismic Toss provides consistent damage and pairs well with Foresight to hit Ghost-types; it can also break most Substitutes, but Scald is better in most situations because of its chance to burn foes. Yawn can be used to force switches, preventing setup sweepers, such as Mawile and Leafeon from being dangerous, though Scald and Toxic can cripple them already. Haze also helps with dealing with setup sweepers, removing their boosts, even if they are behind a Substitute. Rest gives Wartortle a form of recovery, though it is rather risky and therefore should be used in conjunction with cleric support. Counter + Mirror Coat can be used to catch strong attackers off-guard, but Wartortle would have to give up important moves and it relies on prediction.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangela, Roselia, and Gourgeist can either put Wartortle to sleep and prevent it from using Rapid Spin, use Leech Seed on it, or directly KO it with one of their super effective STAB moves. Roselia can also take advantage of Wartortle by forcing its switch and setting up entry hazards. Offensive Grass-types such as Leafeon and Jumpluff can also use Wartortle as setup fodder, but they hate getting burned.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika, Raichu, and Rotom-F can KO Wartortle easily with one of their STAB moves. They can switch in on the turn Wartortle goes for Rapid Spin or Scald and either force it out or OHKO it with Thunderbolt. They can also use Wartortle to gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon that can set up, especially those behind a Substitute, such as Leafeon and Klang, take advantage of Wartortle's poor offensive presence and use it as setup fodder, though they can't set up if Wartortle is running Haze.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Statuses such as poison and burn and entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, can cripple Wartortle, make it unable to continually switch in on attacks and making it use a turn to use Refresh if it carries it, and put it in KO range for strong physical attackers such as Stoutland.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Wartortle relies on its Eviolite to be bulky, so Knock Off users such as Pawniard can hinder Wartortle's bulk by taking Eviolite away from it, though they don't appreciate getting burned.</p> <p><strong>Misdreavus</strong>: Even if Wartortle has access to Foresight to use Rapid Spin against most Ghost-types, the most common one, Misdreavus, is able to Taunt Wartortle and block its Rapid Spin attempt, and Misdreavus can set up on it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin is the main reason Wartortle is used and allows it to remove entry hazards from your side of the field. Scald is Wartortle's main STAB and attacking move, which also has a good chance to burn physical attackers. Foresight makes Wartortle able to pull off a Rapid Spin even against Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist. Toxic is used to cripple walls and limit the foe's longevity, further supporting Wartortle's teammates. Refresh is another option to use over Foresight as it allows Wartortle to remove pesky burns and poison which can easily wear it down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs along with a Bold nature are used to maximize Wartortle's physical bulk, which is the preferred choice, to better take on physical attackers. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can also be used in order to check special attackers such as Floatzel and Simipour better. Eviolite further increases Wartortle's bulk, allowing it to be a solid check to most physical attackers. Torrent empowers Scald when Wartortle's health is low. Rain Dish could be useful to provide some recovery, but rain is rather niche and Wartortle is outclassed by other Pokemon such as Swanna in that playstyle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When entry hazards are on your own side of the field, Wartortle's main task is removing them, unless the opponent carries a Ghost-type. If the opponent carries a Ghost-type, Wartortle should use Foresight and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin the turn after. To make up for Rapid Spin's momentum loss, Wartortle should rely on double switches and a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Toxic should be used early-game to cripple foes from the start, and it should be used against walls, such as Audino, and Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks, such as Politoed and Lumineon. If entry hazards are set up on your side of the field, Wartortle should be switched in against physical attackers it can check, such as Mightyena and Ursaring, and then proceed to use Rapid Spin. Wartortle should not be switched in on special attackers, as it doesn't carry enough Special Defense EVs, making it easier for Wartortle to get KOed or worn down by them. Wartortle should be wary about taking too many hits, especially if it is needed later in the game, as it doesn't carry any form of recovery. Wartortle should also be careful about switching in on Pokemon that carry Knock Off, such as Pawniard, as they can remove its Eviolite, making Wartortle more frail.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wartortle fits best on balanced and defensively oriented teams, as it provides a lot of utility and is a solid check for physical attackers, while it is completely momentum-draining for offensive teams. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Probopass, Rotom-F, and Vullaby help Wartortle, making up for its loss of momentum. Rotom-F and Vullaby also appreciate the removal of Stealth Rock. Special walls such as Audino can tank special attacks for Wartortle and provide Wish and Heal Bell support to help Wartortle live longer, and they appreciate the removal of entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Roselia has good synergy with Wartortle, as it resists both of Wartortle's weaknesses and is able to absorb status for Wartortle thanks to Natural Cure. Other Grass-types, such as Gourgeist and Tangela, can switch in on offensive Grass-types such as Leafeon, which threaten Wartortle. Ground-types, such as Golem and Stunfisk, can switch in on Electric-type attacks and are therefore appreciated by Wartortle.</p>"

  "Butterfree": {
    "overview": "<p>Butterfree is a sweeper that can be very effective late-game with Tinted Lens, which can allow it to break past Pokemon that resist its attacks. It lacks a solid Flying-type move, meaning it has to use moves such as Energy Ball and Psychic, which don't gain STAB. Butterfree cannot switch into many Pokemon due to its terrible defensive typing, mediocre defensive stats, and weakness to Stealth Rock. There are also some Pokemon that can take on its attacks well even with a few boosts and Tinted Lens, such as Probopass and Bouffalant. Butterfree receives competition as a setup sweeper that utilizes Sleep Powder from Jumpluff, but Tinted Lens allows Butterfree to take on Pokemon that usually would wall Jumpluff, such as Ninetales and Drifblim, while Quiver Dance allows it to boost its Speed. Butterfree is also very predictable, seeing as it can only run one viable set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Butterfree could hold an Insect Plate, which doesn't give recoil damage but lessens the amount of damage Butterfree is able to deal. It could also hold Leftovers to receive some health back per turn and allow it to stay on the field longer, but Butterfree needs all the power it can get. Focus Sash can allow Butterfree an almost guaranteed Quiver Dance against a foe, which can help a lot late-game. Butterfree could also utilize a lead set with U-turn, Sleep Powder, Bug Buzz, and a filler move, but it is outclassed by Jumpluff for the most part in such a role. Compound Eyes can be run to allow a high-accuracy Sleep Powder, but such a set often fails to produce any damage against Pokemon with resistances that resist Butterfree's attacks.</p> <p>Butterfree can run Substitute over the coverage move to avoid status and allow an easier setup. In addition to those sets, Butterfree can run a dual powder set with Stun Spore and Sleep Powder to have speed control on the other team and be able to put a Pokemon to sleep. Butterfree can run a Modest nature to increase its damage output, but then it loses to Floatzel and Zebstrika even after a Quiver Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Pokemon such as Golem, Probopass, Stunfisk, Relicanth, Monferno, and Solrock can severely hurt Butterfree with their Stealth Rock, which cuts Butterfree's HP by half and can make it easy to revenge kill. All of these Pokemon have moves that are super effective against Butterfree, such as Volt Switch on Probopass, Discharge on Stunfisk, Rock Blast on Golem, and Flare Blitz on Monferno.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: As Butterfree has pretty poor defensive capabilities and is also weakened by Life Orb recoil, priority moves from the likes of Floatzel, Basculin, and Dodrio can break it down fairly quickly.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Audino, Probopass, Clefairy, Misdreavus, and Roselia have the specially defensive capabilities to easily take on Butterfree if they aren't weakened that much, and can wear it down with status moves.</p> <p><strong>Quicker Pokemon</strong>: Butterfree on its own has a pretty low base Speed in comparison to most attackers. Before a boost Butterfree is outsped by any Pokemon above base 70 Speed with a boosting nature or any Pokemon above base 85 Speed with a neutral nature. After a Quiver Dance boost, Butterfree is outsped by Pokemon such as Swift Swim Golduck, Chlorophyll Sawsbuck, Leafeon, and Weepinbell as well as boosted Ninjask, Agility Kingler, and Agility Articuno. It is also outsped by Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio, Rotom-F, Sawsbuck, Raichu, and Mr. Mime, which can deal solid damage against it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and burn can severely shorten the length of Butterfree's sweep, while paralysis can end a sweep on its own by making Butterfree even slower and easier to manage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sleep Powder can allow free setup and can force an opponent to take away a Pokemon from their team to deal with Butterfree. Quiver Dance allows Butterfree to have a niche in the tier, as Butterfree's only chance to sweep is to boost its offensive stats. Bug Buzz is the only viable STAB move on Butterfree and does a huge hunk of damage to a foe. Any move that you select for Butterfree's final slot will allow it to beat a certain Pokemon but not another. Energy Ball can allow it to take on Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, while it can use Psychic to take on Roselia and Monferno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb allows Butterfree to get the most out of its damaging capabilities and spamming of its Bug moves, with the downside of losing HP. The EVs provide the best Speed and Special Attack that Butterfree can salvage. A Timid nature allows Butterfree to outspeed the likes of Floatzel and Zebstrika after a Quiver Dance. Tinted Lens is used over Compound Eyes to allow for Butterfree to take on Pokemon that resist its moves better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring in Butterfree during late-game to set up and attempt a sweep. It is preferred not to put Butterfree on the field if Stealth Rock is on your side, seeing as it heavily cripples it. Depending on the last slot Butterfree is using, be sure to weaken or take out the Pokemon that wall Butterfree.</p> <p>Butterfree should only set up when faster threats and priority users are eliminated or severely weakened so it won't be crippled by a Taunt or KOed. In most cases, switch Butterfree in after a teammate has fainted or from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from the likes of Vibrava, Probopass, and Lumineon. Butterfree is able to set up on Pokemon locked into a status or resisted move, a Pokemon the foe has to preserve to win, or a Pokemon Butterfree has a type advantage against, such as Tangela, Beheeyem, or Servine.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Butterfree needs to be used in combination with an entry hazard remover because Stealth Rock takes away half of its HP. Examples include Vullaby, Avalugg, Swanna, and Armaldo. It also appreciates entry hazards on its side of the field to weaken foes and break their Focus Sashes. This can be provided by the likes of Golem, Stunfisk, Probopass, Monferno, Roselia, and Solrock. With entry hazard support Butterfree can almost guarantee KOs on Pokemon such as Pawniard, Floatzel, and Zebstrika.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Stoutland, Beheeyem, Simipour, Kadabra, Raichu, Bouffalant, and Servine weaken or take out specially defensive walls such as Audino to allow Butterfree an easier time sweeping. Pokemon like Air Balloon Probopass, Golem, and Stunfisk can take on opposing Probopass, which can give Butterfree a lot of trouble on an attempted sweep, as well as Rock-types in general.</p> <p>Healing Wish support from either Mr. Mime or Clefairy can allow Butterfree to regain its health and attempt another sweep. Memento also helps by excessively weakening the opposing Pokemon and then allowing Butterfree a free turn of setup. It can be provided by Jumpluff or Misdreavus. Dual screen support from Pokemon such as Meowstic and Solrock can assist Butterfree even more and allow easier setup. Clerics such as Audino, Altaria, and Grumpig can heal status from Butterfree to allow for an easier sweep.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Beedrill is an absolutely terrible Pokemon. It has a few good points such as its decent Attack stat and good support movepool, but it's also plagued with a terrible offensive and defensive typing as well as low Speed and abysmal bulk. It's hopelessly outclassed by other suicide leads such as Glalie and Leavanny due to their higher Speed and actual offensive presence, and by Venipede for its ability to outspeed common Taunt and Encore users at +1. It may have a small niche in the combination of Toxic Spikes and Tailwind, but even that isn't enough to make it even a remotely good Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out attacking set with Drill Run can be used, but unless Beedrill is carrying a Focus Sash it's useless, as anything faster than the insect will OHKO it before it can do anything, and it is outclassed by Ninjask. Knock Off is always a good idea to remove items, but this is best left up to Beedrill's teammates. U-turn can be used to preserve Beedrill, letting it set up Toxic Spikes later in the match; however, you usually won't want to have something viable take damage when you could just sacrifice your useless bee. Finally, Giga Drain can 2HKO lead Golem, but it has limited use outside of this due to Beedrill's terrible Special Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Monferno that are faster than Beedrill will almost always 2HKO it, preventing it from using any of its other moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Defog users such as Swanna can easily remove Beedrill's entry hazards, making it completely useless. Vullaby can also Taunt Beedrill and prevent it from setting up more hazards, but specially defensive variants should be wary of X-Scissor. Armaldo and Avalugg can easily remove Beedrill's hazards with Rapid Spin and nullify its Focus Sash in the process. Avalugg can also force Beedrill out with Roar if needed.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Fast Taunt users prevent Beedrill from setting up Toxic Spikes and Tailwind, although some like Murkrow and Simipour should be wary of X-Scissor. Misdreavus is also immune to Endeavor and Toxic Spikes and resists X-Scissor.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Pokemon with multi-hit moves like Golem can technically OHKO Beedrill because they hit multiple times in one turn, thus rendering Beedrill's Focus Sash useless. Common examples are Rock Blast Golem and Bonemerang Marowak.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Grounded Poison-types such as Roselia and Arbok nullify Toxic Spikes as soon as they switch in, making Beedrill useless.</p>",

Endeavor lets Beedrill heavily weaken a foe, as once Beedrill's down to its Focus Sash, the move leaves the foe with exactly 1 HP. X-Scissor is a nice STAB attack to get chip damage before Beedrill faints. Finally, Tailwind lets Beedrill outspeed Pokemon like Simipour and Monferno and give its teammates a Speed boost before it faints.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash lets Beedrill survive one attack and set up at least one layer of Toxic Spikes before fainting. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature lets Beedrill outspeed other leads and get entry hazards up quickly. Maximum Attack lets Beedrill deal decent damage with X-Scissor so its teammates can sweep. Swarm buffs X-Scissor once Beedrill is down to its Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Beedrill as a lead, as that's all it's good at doing, but beware of fast Taunt users and Pokemon with multi-hit moves. If your opponent leads with a faster Pokemon like Raichu, have Beedrill use Tailwind immediately and go for a layer of Toxic Spikes on the next turn. Otherwise, go for Toxic Spikes right away. If up against a really fast foe like Ninjask, leave Beedrill in as death fodder so nothing viable takes damage. Generally, one layer of Toxic Spikes is preferred against offensive teams, but you should attempt to set up two layers against defensive teams because bulkier Pokemon tend to stay in for more turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pawniard, Purugly, and spinblockers such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus can deter or outright stop hazard removers, keeping Beedrill's entry hazards on the field. Fast, strong offensive Pokemon like Kadabra appreciate Toxic Spikes support to wear down bulky Pokemon like Audino. Stealth Rock setters such as Gabite can set up their entry hazards alongside Beedrill's for a really annoying combination that wears foes down every turn. Finally, late-game cleaners such as Mightyena appreciate Toxic Spikes support, as it makes it easier for them to sweep by crippling the opposing team.</p>"

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<p>Pidgeot is totally outclassed by Dodrio, which has a much better Attack stat and access to Knock Off, giving Pidgeot no real niche in the metagame. Although it has access to Defog, it's simply outperformed by Swanna as an offensive Defogger, and even Fearow, which is also unviable, boasts better Attack and coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit can be run as an attempt to get more chip damage on Pokemon switching out, but it is fairly weak unless super effective, and Pidgeot prefers pivoting with U-turn on predicted switches. Tailwind can be run for either sweeping or team support, but this is generally done better by Pelipper, which has a superior secondary STAB type and better bulk. Similarly, Agility offensive sets can be run but are outclassed by Dodrio, which has a better Attack stat and access to Knock Off. Specially offensive sets can be run to not be totally outclassed by Fearow, but they are extremely weak and generally outperformed by Swanna and Chatot. Sharp Beak can be held instead of Leftovers to help make up for Pidgeot's mediocre Attack stat at the cost of losing passive recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Rock- and Steel-types such as Golem and Probopass resist both of Pidgeot's STAB moves, and they can easily switch into any attack and KO Pidgeot. Some, such as Klang, can also set up and sweep while taking little damage from Pidgeot's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Although most Electric-types cannot switch into a Return well, most of PU's offensive Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu can outspeed and OHKO Pidgeot, as well as switch into a Brave Bird if need be. Stunfisk can also wall Pidgeot easily while setting up Stealth Rock and threatening it with Discharge or Static paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Despite not resisting Pidgeot's STAB moves, all relevant Ice-types in the metagame are capable of OHKOing Pidgeot after Stealth Rock. Although Choice Scarf Rotom-F is the only unboosted Ice-type faster than Pidgeot, most are capable of surviving a single Brave Bird or Return, even after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Pidgeot's poor defenses and only passable Speed, many Pokemon in the metagame are capable of outspeeding Pidgeot and OHKOing it after Stealth Rock, such as Quick Feet Ursaring and Rapidash. The few that are incapable of OHKOing Pidgeot after Stealth Rock, such as Focus Sash Kadabra, are still capable of 2HKOing Pidgeot and pressuring it throughout matches.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird and Return function as Pidgeot's dual STAB moves and give it good neutral coverage outside of Rock- and Steel-types. Defog is used to keep entry hazards off the field for more offensively based teams that don't want to lose momentum with a more passive Defogger. Roost keeps Pidgeot healthy, as it's forced to switch into Stealth Rock in order to remove it, and U-turn can keep up the offensive momentum at the cost of leaving Pidgeot prone to being worn down quickly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Pidgeot to outspeed a good portion of the unboosted metagame for a quick Defog, and maximum Attack investment gives it some offensive presence. Leftovers gives Pidgeot some passive recovery to mitigate Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pidgeot's main priority should be to use Defog for team support rather than to go for its weak STAB attacks. Defog and Roost ought to be used when forcing switches versus slower Pokemon that are weak to Brave Bird such as Roselia, as Pidgeot lacks the bulk to take many stronger attacks as it goes for a status move. If running U-turn, this can also be used when forcing switches or versus slower foes to keep up offensive momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can handle Electric-, Rock-, Ice-, and Steel-type switch-ins to Pidgeot such as Stunfisk and Monferno can use the free switch with Pidgeot's U-turn to get a favorable matchup versus foes, as well as handling Pidgeot's common checks and counters. Pokemon that prefer entry hazards gone to be effective such as Lapras appreciate Pidgeot's Defog support. Pokemon with Volt Switch such as Raichu can work with Pidgeot to form a VoltTurn core to wear down opposing teams, and setup sweepers such as Huntail can use Pidgeot's pivoting and wallbreaking capabilities to more easily sweep weakened teams. Golem can set up Stealth Rock to help Pidgeot wallbreak more easily and it checks both Rock- and Electric-types, while Pidgeot can pressure Grass-types for it.</p>"

  "Raticate": {
    "overview": "<p>Raticate has access to the deadly Guts + STAB Facade combination, making it a powerful wallbreaker. Guts makes Raticate unable to be crippled by burn or paralysis, while Facade receives a STAB boost and doubles in Base Power when Raticate is inflicted with a status condition. However, Raticate is outclassed by Quick Feet Ursaring, which hits a higher Speed tier and isn't completely walled by Rock- and Steel-types. Although it is partially outclassed, Raticate has a few niches that separate it from Ursaring, including access to U-turn, which gives your team momentum, and Sucker Punch, which has priority if the foe was about to use an attacking move. That said, a mediocre Attack stat, bad defensive stats, and an average Speed stat limit Raticate's potential for sweeping and cleaning up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Super Fang allows Raticate to cripple walls more easily, while Taunt could be used for more of a supportive utility set. Wild Charge and Grass Knot could be used to cover Water- and Rock- type Pokemon such as Politoed and Golem, respectively. Pursuit can be used for trapping and eliminating Pokemon that might switch out Raticate's attack. A Choice Band set with Hustle is not recommended, but when it hits, it packs a punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Raticate can't really damage Rock- and Steel-types at all, with the exception of Pokemon such as Metang, which could still take a Sucker Punch anyway. Golem is free to do whatever it wants when in on Raticate.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon able to outspeed Raticate naturally and Choice Scarf users are able to KO Raticate fairly easily due to how frail it is. These Pokemon include Raichu, Ninetales, and Rotom-F. However, they have to watch out for Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Bulky Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL easily stall out Raticate due to Raticate's inability to hit them with Sucker Punch. In addition, Raticate can't set up Swords Dances because of Taunt and takes lots of residual damage from Pokemon such as SubSeed Gourgeist-S, which behind a Substitute can safely Seed Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls, such as Avalugg and Tangela, have no problem absorbing Raticate's attacks. Avalugg can take a Facade from Raticate and hit back with an Avalanche or stall with Recover. Avalugg can also take a Swords Dance-boosted Facade as long as it is over 87% health. Physically defensive Tangela easily tanks a Facade from Raticate and can retaliate with Giga Drain or stall with Leech Seed. A Swords-Dance boosted Facade from Raticate 2HKOes Tangela, however.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Although Raticate has Sucker Punch to predict a priority move, it is susceptible to priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Ice Shard, as it is very frail.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Raticate is easily worn down by Toxic damage and entry hazards, limiting the amount of turns that it can attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Raticate to keep momentum for the team. Facade inflicts heavy damage due its STAB and Guts boosts. Sucker Punch allows Raticate to move first against faster targets, as its base 97 Speed stat isn't too great, and hits Ghost-types immune to Facade. Crunch is an alternative to Sucker Punch to remove the need to predict around Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus, but it comes at the cost of the chance to attack first. Protect allows Raticate to freely activate Toxic Orb without taking damage or if it is unable to KO a Pokemon the first turn without Guts activated. Swords Dance allows Raticate to bluff a Protect or freely set up on a forced switch, as a base 81 Attack stat doesn't allow it to truly unlock it's true potential in sweeping and wallbreaking. Revenge could be used to hit common Rock-, Ice- and Steel-types on the switch such as Golem, Avalugg, and Probopass.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs invested in Speed ensures that Raticate outspeeds as much as possible, including base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Sawsbuck. Guts is chosen over Hustle to take advantage of its synergy with Facade. Toxic Orb is ran over Flame Orb because the first two turns of Toxic deal less damage to Raticate than a burn. A Jolly nature is chosen over an Adamant nature to take advantage of Raticate's higher Speed stat that Ursaring doesn't have.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Guts by switching into moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp and using them to Raticate's advantage. Be wary of switching Raticate in on possible attacks, however, as Raticate is not only very frail but it takes damage from its status. Watch out for Steel- and Rock-types. as Raticate cannot do very much damage to them; it's good to U-turn or switch out into a Pokemon with a favorable match up unless Raticate is set up and the opposing Steel- and Rock-types have taken damage. Try to activate Raticate Toxic Orb as soon as possible without having to take a hit, as it is very weak without the boost, which can be done by using Protect, revenge killing a foe, forcing a switch, or having a teammate bringing Raticate in with a pivoting move such as U-turn. Although Raticate has Sucker Punch, be careful of Pokemon with priority moves such as Monferno, as Raticate is very frail. Many people assume Raticate will use Protect, so use this to your advantage when it comes to predicting and use Swords Dance as Pokemon such as Roselia and Fraxure are forced out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon with Spikes or Stealth Rock such as Roselia, Venipede, Quilladin, or Probopass will allow Raticate to KO Pokemon with Sturdy and KO other Pokemon, such as Avalugg more easily, as a +2 Raticate with Facade knocks it out after Stealth Rock damage. Raticate has trouble with Steel-, Rock-, and bulky Ghost-types such as Misdreavus, making Magnet Pull Probopass and Monferno great teammates. The only type of team you would put Raticate on is on a VoltTurn team, so a Pokemon such as Raichu and Purugly pairs well with Raticate. Slow pivots such as Pelipper are also great for absorbing damage and allowing Raticate to get its Toxic Orb activated for free. Stallbreaker Misdreavus and Raticate make a great pairing, as Misdreavus can counter or check Pokemon that wall Raticate such as Avalugg, Golem, and Gourgeist-XL. Misdreavus can burn opposing physical attackers as well as walls to wither them down, allowing Raticate to clean up easily, as well as Taunt walls to make sure they cannot use utility moves. Carry a Pokemon with Rapid Spin or Defog, as Raticate will be switching in and out often and therefore taking lots of entry hazard damage, making Pokemon such as Armaldo, Swanna, and Vullaby great teammates. Smeargle and Leavanny are great on teams with Raticate because Sticky Web allows Raticate to outspeed almost all grounded Pokemon in the tier. Wallbreakers such as Marowak and Simipour help to weaken the enemy team so that Raticate to come in and clean up.</p>"

  "Fearow": {
    "overview": "<p>Fearow has decent offensive stats and Speed in conjunction with unique Ground coverage, but it fails to find its way onto teams due to being totally outclassed by Dodrio thanks to its lack of good Flying STAB and Knock Off. Additionally, Fearow has mediocre defensive stats and is quickly worn down due to its Stealth Rock weakness and Double-Edge's recoil, which makes it unable to switch into most hits. However, Fearow has U-turn and Drill Run, both of which give it a small niche over Dodrio, although it is still held back by the aforementioned issues.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fearow can use Pursuit to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types and weakened foes, but doing so makes Fearow lose an important coverage move, and the move doesn't have much power behind it. While weaker, Return could be used over Double-Edge for no recoil. Fearow could use Quick Attack to outpace faster Pokemon, but then it loses an important coverage move for a weak attack. Choice Scarf can be run over Choice Band to outspeed faster Pokemon, but Fearow loses power as a result. Life Orb can be used in place of Choice Band to allow Fearow to choose between its coverage moves while retaining a power boost, but this compounds its frailness and makes it easier to take out. Expert Belt can also be used to feign a Choice Band and surprise a foe, but then Fearow loses out on much-needed power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Rotom-F, Regice, Avalugg, and Lapras threaten Fearow with their Ice-type moves. In addition, Rotom-F can outpace it with a Choice Scarf and Regice can outpace it after a Rock Polish.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raichu, Zebstrika, and Rotom-F have access to super effective STAB moves against Fearow, but they are KOed by Double-Edge after Stealth Rock. Raichu and Zebstrika can outpace Fearow without boosts, but Rotom-F needs a Choice Scarf to be able to.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Golem, Probopass, Armaldo, Relicanth, Crustle, and Solrock can threaten Fearow with their Rock-type moves, but bar Solrock and Crustle, they need to watch out for Drill Run. However, most Rock-types can still use Fearow to set up entry hazards and Relicanth and Crustle can set up Rock Polish or Shell Smash respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus and Dusknoir can deter Fearow from locking itself into Return, as they can switch in and burn it or its teammates. Misdreavus can also dodge Drill Run with Levitate, and Dusknoir can knock Fearow out with a Choice Band-boosted Thunder Punch or Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Damage from Stealth Rock and status can chip away at Fearow's health and make it easy to revenge kill; burns also lower its Attack.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drill Peck gains a STAB bonus and is Fearow's best option for a Flying-type move, allowing it to take on Grass- and Fighting-types. Double-Edge gains a STAB bonus as well and deals great damage to a foe that doesn't resist it. Drill Run hits Rock- and Steel-types, such as Golem, Probopass, and Pawniard for super effective damage and prevents Fearow from being setup fodder against them. U-turn gains momentum against an opposing team and allows Fearow to switch out of unfavorable matchups.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs in conjunction with a Jolly nature allow Fearow to be as fast and effective as it can, outspeeding the likes of Basculin, Gourgeist-S, and Swanna, as well as Speed tying with Ninetales and Dodrio. Choice Band allows Fearow to deal massive damage and allows Fearow to be an effective wallbreaker, but has the drawback of locking it into a singular move. Keen Eye is the preferred ability because Sniper is illegal with Double-Edge.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fearow performs best early- to mid-game by breaking through walls and wearing down foes for its teammates. Fearow could use U-turn for momentum if you expect a foe to switch out. Either via VoltTurn chains or after a teammate has been KOed, Fearow can be brought in on a weak attacker. Most of the time, Fearow should lock itself into Double-Edge, unless the opponent has Steel-, Rock-, or Ghost-type Pokemon or if Fearow is weakened. If you predict a Rock- or Steel-type to switch in, such as Probopass or Golem, use Drill Run. Drill Peck should only be used in situations where you need a bit more damage to take out a Ghost-type, if you're faced with a bulky Grass- or Fighting-type such as Quilladin or Monferno, or if Fearow has been weakened to the point that Double-Edge can bring it in a foe's KO range. Attempt not to switch in Fearow if Stealth Rock is up on its side of the field or into any attack in general due to its pitiful defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Swanna, Vibrava, and Armaldo can allow Fearow not to be pressured or put into priority moves' KO range by residual damage from Stealth Rock. Entry hazard setters such as Probopass, Golem, Stunfisk, and Roselia can weaken the opposing team when they switch in, as well as breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy so Fearow can clean more easily. Monferno can take on Ice-, Steel-, and Rock-types for Fearow and can allow it to sweep more easily, and Steel-types such as Klang, Probopass, and Pawniard can take on Ice- and Rock-types for Fearow. Golem, Gabite, and other Ground-types can weaken Steel- and Rock-types for Fearow and check Electric-types, but they have to be careful of coverage moves. Setup sweepers such as Leafeon, Huntail, and Simipour can clean more easily thanks to Fearow's wallbreaking. Pokemon that can deal with Ghost-types, such as Pawniard and Stoutland, can allow Fearow to spam Double-Edge more freely, with the former using Dark-type moves or trapping them with Pursuit and the latter using a Scrappy Frustration or Facade. Volt Switch users, such as Probopass, Raichu, Zebstrika, and Rotom-F, can form a VoltTurn core with Fearow and generate more momentum for their team.</p>"

Raichu has excellent Speed that lets it outrun the majority of the PU tier, allowing it to revenge kill and clean up while still being able to wallbreak. Raichu is also good at taking advantage of forced switches by pivoting with Volt Switch or setting up with Nasty Plot. Raichu faces a lot of competition from the faster Zebstrika and Electrode, but it has the advantages of hitting harder and having access to Nasty Plot. It also faces competition with Electabuzz, which is bulkier, but Raichu is a little faster and has Nasty Plot. Finally, Raichu is very frail, meaning that it is easily revenge killed and has a hard time setting up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf lets Raichu outspeeds the entire unboosted tier, as well as many Choice Scarf Pokemon in PU, helping it land surprise KOs on fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and Ninjask, but Raichu loses a lot of power by forgoing Life Orb, making it quite underwhelming at times. Raichu also faces competition from Electabuzz as an Electric-type Choice Scarf user, although Raichu has the advantage of outspeeding Stoutland in the sand. Choice Specs is also a usable item for more power than Life Orb, but getting locked into one move is horrible for Raichu and not worth the extra power. Choice Band Raichu can be used due to its access to priority in the form of Extreme Speed, strong Electric-type STAB moves in Volt Tackle and Wild Charge, and Knock Off. However, Raichu can't use Volt Tackle in conjunction with Extreme Speed, both of which are crucial moves for physical Raichu. Knock Off instead of a coverage move can be used to remove Eviolite from Pokemon like Roselia, Clefairy, and Metang that try to switch in. Encore can also be used to lock the foe into an ineffective move such as an Electric-type attack. Finally, Substitute is an option for the Nasty Plot set and can be used alongside Salac Berry instead of Life Orb to increase Raichu's Speed after setting up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem and Camerupt completely shut down Raichu's STAB moves, simultaneously preventing it from escaping with Volt Switch. Stunfisk needs to be extremely weakened for Hidden Power Ice or Surf to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Roselia, Gogoat, and Gourgeist-XL all give Raichu trouble by taking little damage from its STAB attacks. Hidden Power Ice doesn't do enough to KO them unless they are severally weakened. Roselia in particular is the best check to Raichu because of its high special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Raichu has trouble breaking through specially defensive Pokemon, such as Grumpig and Audino, until it gets enough Nasty Plot boosts. These Pokemon can also KO Raichu or in Audino's case possibly Encore it into Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Zebstrika can greatly damage or KO Raichu because of its frailness. Any viable Choice Scarf users, notably Simipour and Mr. Mime, can outspeed and KO Raichu once it is weakened.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards, status conditions, and Life Orb recoil can quickly weaken Raichu until it can't switch in or use a move without getting KOed.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Priority moves such as Pawniard's Sucker Punch and Monferno's Mach Punch can easily revenge kill a weakened Raichu due to its frailness and its own lack of priority. Murkrow is notable in that it can OHKO Raichu with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",

Thunderbolt is Raichu's best STAB move with its good power and no drawbacks. Focus Blast gives Raichu good coverage and hits Pokemon like Audino and Regice, while Hidden Power Ice does good damage to Grass-types and Ground-types, such as Gourgeist-XL and Stunfisk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Raichu's good Speed and Special Attack. A Timid nature is used instead of a Modest nature to let Raichu to Speed tie with Jumpluff and outspeed everything slower such as Simipour, Ninetales, and Dodrio. Lightning Rod can boost Raichu's Special Attack while also giving Raichu an immunity to Electric-type moves. Life Orb increases Raichu's damage so that it can wallbreak more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Raichu's primary focus should be to wallbreak mid-game; however, Nasty Plot should only be used against bulkier Pokemon such as specially defensive Clefairy and Grumpig, as the extra power is needed to damage them enough for a KO. Late-game cleaning is possible against slower teams once they have been softened up enough. Raichu's nice Speed tier also lets it revenge kill Pokemon like as Stoutland, Simipour, and Rapidash. Nasty Plot can be used on forced switches. Raichu should never be switched in directly because it is so frail. Priority move users, such as Dodrio and Pawniard, and Choice Scarf users, such as Simipour and Sawsbuck, are important to take out because many of their attacks can KO Raichu. In addition, Raichu should be wary of switching into Electric-type attacks because it can be severely crippled by a mispredicted move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour and Flying-types such as Dodrio appreciate Raichu's immunity to Electric, which also stops Volt Switch, while they can get rid of Ground- and Grass-types, respectively, for it. Fire-types such as Simisear and Monferno can KO Grass-types in exchange for Raichu KOing the majority of Water-types for them. Entry hazard setters such as Roselia and Metang make Raichu's job of wallbreaking easier by weakening the opponent's Pokemon. For example, one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock will ensure the OHKO on Regice with a +2 Focus Blast. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Swanna and Vullaby makes it easier for Raichu to switch in. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Probopass and Vibrava can give Raichu free switches. Mr. Mime and Clefairy can use Healing Wish to let Raichu have a second chance at wallbreaking or cleaning. Roselia lures such as Knock Off Tangela, Knock Off Simipour, and Choice Band Floatzel can weaken or KO Roselia so that it can't check Raichu.</p>"

Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB move for Raichu to use when staying in. Surf is Raichu's main coverage move and hits Rock- and Ground-types, such as Camerupt and Stunfisk, much harder than any other move. Hidden Power Ice is a secondary coverage move that hits Grass-types, such as Gourgeist-XL and Jumpluff.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Raichu more power to be a more threatening cleaner. Maximum Special Attack investment boosts Raichu's already good Special Attack, while maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets it outspeed fast Pokemon such as Simisear and Simisage. Static must be Raichu's ability because Lightning Rod is incompatible with Surf.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In the early-game, Raichu will be using Volt Switch to pivot out of and wear down its counters such as Clefairy and Grumpig to weaken them. As the match goes on, Raichu can be used as both a revenge killer and a late-game cleaner. Raichu is too frail to come in on direct hits, so the best option is to come in on a teammate's slow Volt Switch, U-turn, or after a teammate faints. Ground-types and Lightning Rod users need to be weakened enough so that Raichu can take them out by itself, as otherwise, Raichu can't use Volt Switch and Thunderbolt safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raichu should be paired with Water-types, such as Floatzel and Simipour, because they can easily get rid of Ground-types. Flying-types such as Dodrio and Chatot can KO Grass-types that resist Raichu's STAB moves. Fire-types such as Monferno and Simisear can also take out Grass-types for Raichu, while Raichu can take out Water-types for them in return. Defoggers such as Swanna and Vibrava can clear the field of entry hazards, which is important because Raichu already takes so much residual damage from Life Orb. Ninjask and other U-turn users can make a nice VoltTurn core with Raichu, and some slower users of pivoting moves can be used so that Raichu can have an easy time switching in. Knock Off users such as Simisage can remove Eviolite and Leftovers from foes so that Raichu has an easier time weakening them with Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Clefairy": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Clefairy appears to be outclassed by other Fairy-types; however, Eviolite and Calm Mind can easily make up for its lackluster bulk, and can switch into the majority of special attackers such as Floatzel. Magic Guard allows Clefairy to easily set up on defensive Pokemon, and Poison- and Steel-types, Clefairy's two weaknesses, are not very common in the PU metagame. Clefairy also has a big movepool, with access to decent coverage in Flamethrower and Stored Power, along with support moves such as Soft-Boiled, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave. Unfortunately, it is not bulky enough to comfortably take strong hits such as Stoutland's Return.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can be used to stop set up sweepers such as Ninetales, Heal Bell clears its teammates status condition, and Magic Coat prevents entry hazard setters such as Roselia from setting up on it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Ninetales, and Simisear resist Moonblast, take little damage from Clefairy's unboosted coverage moves, and can respond by knocking Clefairy's Eviolite off or dealing heavy damage with their STAB moves. Ninetales has good Special Defense and thus can set up Nasty Plots faster than Clefairy can boost its Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Strong Pokemon</strong>: Strong wallbreakers, such as Stoutland and mixed Simipour, can survive a hit from Clefairy and 2HKO it by hitting it on its Defense. Marowak is particularly good, as it can KO Clefairy with the combination of Knock Off and Bonemerang. This offensive pressure applied by strong Pokemon also makes it hard for Clefairy to set up, meaning special attackers such as Regice and Beheeyem can check it.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Without its Eviolite, Clefairy struggles to stomach physical hits, allowing Pokemon such as Basculin and Leafeon to 2HKO it. Although Clefairy beats most Knock Off users, Audino and Leafeon can survive boosted hits.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Clefairy isn't running Flamethrower, Steel-types such as Probopass and Metang can easily switch in, set up, use Stealth Rock, and deal heavy damage with their Steel-type STAB moves.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Soft-Boiled is Clefairy's main form of reliable recovery; however, it doesn't allow Clefairy to fully support its teammates like Wish does. Moonblast is Clefairy's main STAB move and only offensive tool, and it is useful to hit Fighting- and Dragon-types hard, even without Special Attack investment whereas Seismic Toss does more reliable damage. Thunder Wave can cripple fast threats, such as Ninetales and Simipour, and support slower teammates. Stealth Rock is useful to passively damage the enemy's team every time a foe switches in, making it easier for teammates to get KOs. Knock Off provides even more utility, as it allows Clefairy to cripple Pokemon that rely on their items, especially bulky Eviolite users that usually switch in on Clefairy, such as opposing Clefairy. Healing Wish is an option to let Clefairy fully heal a wounded teammate, potentially giving them a second shot at sweeping</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defensive investment with a Calm nature allows Clefairy to be as durable as possible to tank hits even from strong and common special attackers such as Simipour and Ninetales without much trouble. 4 Defense EVs make Clefairy a bit bulkier physically. Eviolite provides Clefairy with a great source of bulk, allowing it to be a specially defensive wall, but it also makes Clefairy rely on its item. Magic Guard prevents Clefairy from taking residual damage from status and entry hazards, which is greatly appreciated, especially when it has to switch in multiple times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible to rack up as much residual damage as possible on foes. Clefairy isn't supposed to switch in on strong physical attackers, such as Stoutland and Ursaring, as its physical bulk isn't that good, even with the boost that Eviolite gives. Clefairy should pivot in on weak attackers or specially based ones, such as Grumpig and Zebstrika, as they deal little damage to it, and make use of free turns by using utility moves such as Thunder Wave to cripple foes. Be wary to Knock Off users, such as Pawniard and Simipour, as they can remove Clefairy's Eviolite, reducing its bulk and limiting its opportunities to switch in. Clefairy has to stay healthy throughout the match to keep pivoting in on strong special attackers, such as Simipour and Kadabra, so it should use Soft-Boiled often.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clefairy fits best on stall and balanced teams, as it is a good special wall with access to decent coverage and utility moves, which allows it to support teammates effectively, but it is too passive to work well on offensively oriented teams. Misdreavus fits well on defensively oriented teams, as it blocks Rapid Spin and threatens strong physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and Foul Play. Camerupt synergizes well with Clefairy, as it is able to check Fire- and Steel-types, which wall Clefairy. Because Clefairy struggles with physical attackers, physical walls such as Tangela and Stunfisk are good partners, thanks to their high Defense stat.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Clefairy to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it tank hits better while also allowing it to set up with more ease. Soft-Boiled provides recovery, as without Leftovers, Clefairy will get worn down easily. Moonblast, Clefairy's primary STAB move, has decent coverage in the PU metagame. Thunder Wave cripples faster threats and allows Clefairy to set up on Pokemon such as Roselia and Probopass, whereas Stored Power hits Poison- and Fire-types and is fairly strong after a few uses of Calm Mind. Flamethrower hits Steel-types and Roselia and can do decent damage to switch-ins, but running it over Stored Power makes Clefairy lose to Fire-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment increases Clefairy's physical bulk to allow it to take both physical and special hits well after Calm Mind boosts. Eviolite increases Clefairy's bulk even more, allowing it to take physical hits decently well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefairy should set up on walls, such as Altaria. It is best used late-game, when stronger threats and Pokemon that resist Fairy are gone. Clefairy should spam Calm Mind and Soft-Boiled until it has enough boosts to sweep. Clefairy should try not to take a Knock Off, as without its Eviolite, Clefairy is fairly frail and easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes from Roselia allows Clefairy to pressure the opposing team when setting up and stall out strong Pokemon that can only knock Clefairy down to half its HP with Soft-Boiled. Ground-types, such as Camerupt and Golem, can threaten Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types for Clefairy. Water-type Pokemon, such as Prinplup, check Fire-types, which can set up on Clefairy. Monferno is a particularly good teammate, as it checks Fire- and Steel-types while also being able to take a Knock Off. Other physical walls, such as Solrock, Tangela, and Stunfisk, which beat strong Pokemon such as Stoutland, are appreciated. Clefairy fits better on defensive teams due to its passive nature, but it can be used on balanced teams.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ninetales is one of the best Fire-types in PU, acting as a threatening sweeper with its great Speed and access to the elusive boosting move Nasty Plot. With its great coverage, good power, and above-average Speed, Ninetales is capable of sweeping through teams with ease. However, Ninetales is troubled by common special walls in PU, particularly Lickilicky; is outsped and revenge killed by common Pokemon such as Floatzel, Rapidash, Simipour, and Raichu; and is worn down easily due to its low physical bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used in the last slot to hit Zweilous. More defensively oriented sets with Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split are viable, as is a Substitute + Pain Split set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Ursaring, Floatzel, Simipour and Purugly can outspeed and dispatch of Ninetales even if it has set up, as can Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Mr. Mime, Sawsbuck, and Rotom-F.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Ninetales's great coverage and good power mean that it is difficult to wall. However, Encore Audino and the rare Munchlax can wall even a Ninetales that has set up, and Pokemon such as Pelipper and Probopass do a decent job of taking it on before it has set up.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Ninetales's weakness to Stealth Rock, vulnerability to Spikes, and possible Life Orb recoil can wear it down rather quickly. It can also be worn down quite easily by Toxic from Pokemon such as Pelipper.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot lets Ninetales function as a threatening late-game sweeper. Fire Blast is a very strong STAB move that makes up for Ninetales's average Special Attack stat, but Flamethrower is a viable option as well if better accuracy and higher PP are preferred. Energy Ball hits Rock- and Water-types such as Golem and Floatzel, while Dark Pulse can 2HKO Grumpig. Substitute lets Ninetales block status and block weaker attacks, letting it set up on Pokemon such as Audino more easily. Hidden Power Ground is also an option to KO opposing Fire-types and Probopass after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Ninetales quite a bit of power in exchange for longevity, while Leftovers does the opposite. Leftovers should be used with Substitute and Life Orb with Hidden Power Ground. Passho Berry lets Ninetales avoid being revenge killed by Aqua Jet users such as Basculin and faster Water-types such as Simipour. The given EV spread is standard for a special attacker, and Flash Fire is helpful for pivoting into other Fire-types and forcing them out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up on something Ninetales forces out, such as Roselia. Thanks to Ninetales's good special bulk, it can switch into special attackers that it has a type advantage against, such as Clefairy and Tangela, quite easily, though it must be wary of Sleep Powder from the latter. If Ninetales can't set up, just spam Fire Blast unless the opponent has a Flash Fire Pokemon, in which case Hidden Power Ground is your best option as it 2HKOes every Flash Fire user in PU with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Ursaring, and Stoutland can help open holes in the opposing team to let Ninetales sweep more easily. Pokemon that can switch into Water-types and revenge killers are helpful; Politoed in particular beats most Water-types and checks Rapidash. Strong special attackers such as Simipour and Chatot can help wear down walls such as Lickilicky. Sticky Web support is useful for Ninetales as it prevents Ninetales from being revenge killed by the likes of Ursaring, Zebstrika, and Simipour.</p>"

  "Wigglytuff": {
    "overview": "<p>Wigglytuff is barely viable in PU due to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and pressure Defog users with its ability Competitive and its wide movepool that gives it a plethora of good coverage, like Fire Blast, to choose from. Though Wigglytuff boasts a great HP stat, its defenses are low, which means it is easy to wear down and revenge kill. It also has a mediocre Speed stat, which makes it hard for it to function as an offensive Pokemon and causes it to be outsped and checked by common threats such as Stoutland and Leafeon. In general, there are better options for bulky attackers and Stealth Rock setters, but Wigglytuff plays a unique role by being a bulky special attacker and Stealth Rock setter with the ability to boost its Special Attack thanks to Competitive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used as a coverage move to hit Flying- and Ground-types such as Jumpluff and Stunfisk super effectively, and Thunderbolt is an option to hit Water-types like Politoed. Wigglytuff can also use Flamethrower instead of Fire Blast if you're afraid of it missing, but the move is not as strong and therefore doesn't get nearly as many KOs. Shadow Ball is also a choice to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Grumpig and Misdreavus super effectively. Thunder Wave is an option to let Wigglytuff cripple fast Pokemon for it and its teammates to outspeed more easily. While unorthodox, Sing is another choice that cripples nearly any Pokemon and forces switches, but it is unreliable due to its low accuracy. Knock Off can be used to cripple Eviolite users such as Clefairy and other bulky Pokemon such as Roselia, as they tend to switch into Wigglytuff often. Toxic also cripples specially bulky Pokemon like Regice and Audino, whose bulk allows them to switch into Wigglytuff. A defensive set running Wish can be used to let Wigglytuff restore health to stay on the field longer and pass large chunks of health to its teammates; however, this role is outclassed by Audino and Clefairy due to their higher defensive stats and better defensive abilities. Finally, Magic Coat is an option to deflect Taunt or opposing entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Klang, Metang, and Probopass can all 2HKO Wigglytuff with their Steel-type STAB moves, and Pawniard can OHKO it with Iron Head; however, because Wigglytuff can survive a hit from most of them, it can easily retaliate with Focus Blast or Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Arbok and Roselia can OHKO Wigglytuff with Gunk Shot and Sludge Bomb, respectively, but Wigglytuff can retaliate with Fire Blast if it does somehow survive a hit or Gunk Shot misses. Swalot, however, completely counters Wigglytuff.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Audino and Clefairy are both not even 3HKOed by Hyper Voice, not to mention that they both have decent forms of recovery in Wish and Soft-Boiled, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Golem both outspeed or Speed tie with and can easily KO Wigglytuff with their strong STAB moves in Return and Earthquake. However, neither of them can reliably switch in.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Even though they can't directly switch in reliably, faster attackers such as Simisage and Floatzel can easily KO Wigglytuff.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Wigglytuff to provide support for its teammates in the form of consistent damage to switch-ins and breaking any potential Sturdy or Focus Sash. Hyper Voice is boosted by STAB and provides Wigglytuff with good neutral coverage. Dazzling Gleam, when used in tandem with Hyper Voice, lets Wigglytuff hit every type bar Steel for at least neutral damage, and it lets Wigglytuff heavily damage Dark- and Dragon-types such as Vullaby, Altaria, and Fraxure. Fire Blast allows Wigglytuff to hit most Steel-types such as Mawile and Bronzor. Moreover, it can be used to hit Metang and Roselia super effectively as they attempt to switch into Wigglytuff's STAB moves. Focus Blast is an alternative that, unlike Fire Blast, can OHKO Probopass. Additionally, Focus Blast still gives Wigglytuff a way to hit Steel-types such as Klang, as well as Ice-, Normal-, and Rock-types such as Rotom-F, Bouffalant, and Relicanth.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment, as well as a Timid nature and Life Orb, lets Wigglytuff hit hard and outspeed as much as possible. A Modest nature can be used instead of a Timid one to let Wigglytuff hit even harder, giving it a chance to OHKO Monferno with Stealth Rock damage factored in. Competitive lets Wigglytuff take advantage of Defog and generally discourages the use of said move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Wigglytuff as a switch-in to Defoggers to gain a free Special Attack boost. Try to set up Stealth Rock early-game to deal as much residual damage as possible throughout the match; this is used in tandem with Competitive to either discourage Defoggers from coming in and using the move or to bait them into using Defog and thus providing Wigglytuff with a free Special Attack boost. Wigglytuff can potentially switch into or check Pokemon such as Dragon- and Ghost-types which it has a type advantage over, stronger Pokemon such as Fraxure and Gabite can potentially 2HKO Wigglytuff with coverage moves. Switch out of strong physical attackers such as Stoutland, as they can easily outspeed and OHKO Wigglytuff, unless Wigglytuff is no longer needed to set up Stealth Rock, as then it should be death foddered to allow a teammate to switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wigglytuff normally fits best on offensively oriented teams. Pokemon that easily take care of Steel-types, such as Rapidash and Monferno, as well as Pokemon that take care of Poison-types, such as Metang and Gabite, are ideal partners. Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Grumpig, and Mr. Mime appreciate Wigglytuff's ability to check Ghost-types. U-turn, and Volt Switch users such as Jumpluff and Zebstrika help Wigglytuff get in safely and provide boosts in momentum for the entire team. Spikes setters such as Roselia and Quilladin are good teammates because Wigglytuff deters the use of Defog, allowing entry hazards to stay on the field for as long as possible. Similarly, other entry hazard setters like Leavanny are good team options for the same reason, and in return, Leavanny's Sticky Web can patch up Wigglytuff's low Speed stat.</p>"

Parasect's typing is very poor defensively, giving it common weaknesses to Fire-types, such as Ninetales, Flying-types, such as Jumpluff, and Poison-types, such as Roselia. In addition to this, Parasect has subpar defensive stats, a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, and a low Speed stat. Parasect is also unable to make use of its resistances because most Pokemon run super effective coverage moves, such as Raichu with Hidden Power Ice, and Floatzel with Ice Beam, preventing Parasect from countering them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>X-Scissor helps Parasect to hit Grass-types, such as Sawsbuck and Tangela, but it lacks the moveslot for it and Knock Off generally cripples them anyway. Leech Seed lets Parasect drain the foe's health, but the recovery provided by Synthesis is more reliable. Parasect could make use of Agility and Swords Dance in order for it to sweep, but it is hard to use because of its very low base Speed stat. Brick Break is an option to get past Steel-types such as Probopass, but it has little use outside of that. Aromatherapy allows Parasect to function as a cleric, but other support moves are preferred. Pursuit can be useful to trap an opponent, but Parasect doesn't force too many Pokemon out and it is quite weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales and Monferno can take advantage of Parasect's 4x weakness to Fire and KO it with their STAB moves. Ninetales is also able to use Parasect as setup fodder and can dodge Spore thanks to Substitute. However, none of them are able to switch into Spore.</p> <p><strong>Spore Immunities</strong>: Grass-types such as Roselia and Jumpluff and Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Zebstrika can switch in on a predicted Spore and easily handle Parasect, with Roselia having Sludge Bomb, Jumpluff having Acrobatics, and Zebstrika having Overheat. However, Roselia must watch out for Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Dodrio and Swanna can easily outspeed Parasect and KO it with their STAB moves, but they are unable to switch in on Spore.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers, such as Rotom-F and Regice, are often able to KO Parasect with their STAB moves. Strong physical attackers such as Stoutland can also deal tons of damage due to Parasect's mediocre bulk. However, most of them are unable to switch in on a Spore.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Although Parasect has access to reliable recovery in Synthesis, it has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Burns and poison also put a timer on Parasect and cripple it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon whose STAB moves Parasect resists, such as Floatzel and Zebstrika, can often hit it with their coverage moves, with Simipour having Ice Beam and Zebstrika having Overheat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spore": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore allows Parasect to cripple an opposing foe with perfect accuracy. Synthesis is a reliable recovery move that allows Parasect to stay healthy during the match. Seed Bomb prevents Parasect from being Taunt bait and hits Water-types, such as Floatzel and Swanna, and Ground-types, such as Stunfisk. Knock Off allows Parasect to remove items from Pokemon, such as Eviolite from Tangela and Monferno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread maximizes Parasect's physical bulk and minimizes the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Dry Skin allows Parasect to absorb a Water-type attack when switching in and restore HP. Leftovers provides passive recovery and allows Parasect to stay healthy during the match. A specially defensive spread is an option in order for Parasect to make use of its typing and check special attackers such as Raichu and Floatzel more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Parasect should switch in on predicted Electric-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Raichu and Stunfisk, but it must be wary of their coverage moves. If Stealth Rock is up, Parasect should be wary of switching in, as the damage can bring it down to 2HKO or OHKO range. Parasect also cannot reliably switch in on special attacks, except for a predicted Water-type attack from Pokemon such as Floatzel. Parasect should try to go for Spore most of the time, but it must be wary of Pokemon that can absorb Spore, such as Roselia and Zebstrika; if you predict such a Pokemon to switch in or if Parasect has just used Spore, Parasect should use Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Parasect only fits on defensive teams due to its passivity. Defoggers and spinners such as Pelipper, Vibrava, and Armaldo are able to remove entry hazards that normally trouble Parasect, such as Stealth Rock. Rock-types such as Golem appreciate Parasect's ability to take Water-type attacks while in return they can take Fire- and Flying-type attacks. Grumpig is a good partner, as it is able to take Fire- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Parasect and act as a special wall, while Parasect is able to take physical attacks. Water-types such as Swanna and Floatzel are able to handle Fire-types, for Parasect. Fire-types such as Rapidash and Monferno can help Parasect to take on Ice- and Steel-types. Zebstrika is able to take on Jumpluff, which walls and sets up on Parasect.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Persian is one of the fastest Pokemon in PU thanks to its excellent base 115 Speed, which lets it outspeed most of the unboosted tier. However, in terms of being a physical Normal-type attacker, it is generally outclassed by Purugly, which has a higher base Attack and a great ability in Defiant. Persian does carve out a niche for itself thanks to its access to Nasty Plot and Technician. However, outside of its Speed, all of Persian's other stats are pretty mediocre, meaning that Persian won't be hitting as hard off the bat. This, combined with Persian's lack of resistances and its frail defenses, makes Persian hard to set up and easy to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt allows Persian to function as a fast anti-lead, but Persian doesn't have the moveslot for it. Choice Specs with Switcheroo can surprise bulkier threats and walls, but Persian is still weak even with Choice Specs and also doesn't have a moveslot for Switcheroo. Hypnosis can put a foe to sleep so that Persian can set up Nasty Plot easier, but the inaccuracy is a problem. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Water-types such as Pelipper harder. A physical set with Fake Out / Return / Knock Off / U-turn can be run, but it is outclassed by Purugly which has more power and access to Defiant. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Probopass after a Nasty Plot boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special walls and tanks such as Audino, Regice, and Grumpig can take any unboosted attack with ease and either recover health, cripple Persian with status, or just deal more damage to Persian and capitalize on its poor defenses.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Zebstrika, as well as Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Rotom-F, can beat Persian with their STAB attacks because of Persian's low defenses combined with Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic wears down Persian over time, whereas paralysis lowers Persian's Speed, allowing slower Pokemon to outspeed and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Persian is frail and relies on Life Orb for maximum damage output, and this combined with Persian's susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards means that priority attacks such as Monferno's Mach Punch, Mightyena's and Pawniard's Sucker Punch, Purugly's Fake Out, and Basculin's Aqua Jet can KO Persian or at least put it in range to be KOed next turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot provides a boost to Persian's Special Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. Hyper Voice is Persian's main STAB move, hitting for respectable damage while also hitting opposing foes behind Substitute. Hidden Power Ghost provides coverage against Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, which are immune to Hyper Voice as well as Psychic-types such as Kadabra, Beheeyem, and Soundproof Mr. Mime, which is immune to Hyper Voice. Water Pulse provides Persian with coverage against Rock-types such as Golem and Probopass, which resist Persian's Normal-type STAB attack, and also OHKOes Pawniard after a Nasty Plot and Stealth Rock damage. Substitute is an option in the last moveslot, as it allows Persian to set up Nasty Plot easier while dodging Sucker Punch and status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs allow Persian to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature allows Persian to Speed tie with Floatzel and opposing Persian while outspeeding everything below that. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense to let Persian take slightly less damage from priority attacks while maintaining an odd HP number to minimize entry hazard damage. Life Orb is the preferred item to boost the power of all of Persian's attacks at the cost of longevity. Technician is Persian's preferred ability, providing a boost to Persian's coverage moves with 60 Base Power or less.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Persian is frail and has a bad defensive typing, it shouldn't be switching into attacks. Instead, bring Persian in after a teammate has fainted; from a slow Volt Switch or U-turn; or on a predicted Ghost-type attack. Try to set up Nasty Plot on predicted switches or against Pokemon that Persian can force out, such as Kadabra and Dodrio. Be mindful of using attacks that opposing Pokemon resist or are immune to, as Life Orb recoil wears Persian down over time. Also keep in mind that being poisoned or paralyzed hampers Persian immensely, so keep Persian as healthy as possible. Persian is best used as a late-game sweeper once bulkier foes, Pokemon faster than Persian, and priority users such as Monferno are eliminated or weak enough to the point where Persian can take them out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Persian appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem, Roselia, Stunfisk, and Venipede, as they turn 2HKOs into OHKOs on Pokemon such as Regice and Jumpluff with Hyper Voice after a boost. Wallbreakers that can weaken bulkier Pokemon, such as Simipour, can wear down the opposing team, allowing Persian to sweep more efficiently. Psychic- and Flying-types, such as Beheeyem and Dodrio, can handle Fighting-types for Persian. Meowstic and Solrock can provide dual screen support for Persian, making it easier for Persian to set up Nasty Plot. Support from Healing Wish Mr. Mime revives a weakened Persian, giving Persian a second chance at sweeping. Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Avalugg helps out Persian, as Persian is to all forms of entry hazards.</p>"

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Golduck is a threatening rain sweeper in PU, outspeeding even Choice Scarf Raichu in the rain by virtue of Swift Swim. Golduck's Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump in the rain easily OHKOes most offensive Pokemon and 2HKOes almost any special wall that doesn't resist it. It also has useful coverage moves in Psyshock and Ice Beam, allowing it to beat common Pokemon that can take its STAB attack, such as Roselia and Tangela. Golduck also functions well as a threat on non-rain teams by setting up Rain Dance on a forced switch or on a foe that can't deal much damage to it, such as Torkoal. However, Golduck is somewhat slow outside of rain, making it easy to pressure so that it has difficulties setting up rain itself. Additionally, it is easily worn down by Life Orb recoil, and rain turns can be stalled out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Electric can be used on Golduck's Rain Dance set specifically to OHKO Swanna, but Swanna is already 2HKOed by Hydro Pump. Synchronoise hits Politoed and other Water-types much harder than Psychic, but it can give non-Water-type Pokemon free switches in. A Calm Mind set with either Substitute or Encore makes Golduck a viable sweeper, but Golduck has trouble finding setup opportunities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Two rain-boosted Hydro Pumps can KO any special wall, but Audino, Grumpig, and Clefairy can still play around its low accuracy and Life Orb recoil. Specially defensive Grumpig and Clefairy can check Golduck in a one-on-one situation by surviving Hydro Pump and inflicting paralysis in return. Regice also avoids the OHKO from Hydro Pump and can damage Golduck heavily with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Politoed and Lapras are complete stops to Golduck, as it cannot do significant amounts of damage to them with Psychic. Offensive Water-types such as Swanna and Floatzel can survive any hit from full health, although Golduck needs little chip damage to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Quick Feet Ursaring and Raichu can outspeed and KO Golduck before it gets the chance to set up.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Roselia and Gogoat can survive multiple Ice Beams depending on their EVs and hit Golduck back hard with Giga Drain and Horn Leech, respectively, recovering health in the process. Pokemon such as Simisage and Jumpluff can also revenge kill Golduck outside of rain, but they are outsped if rain is still up.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Golduck won't be OHKOed by any priority move at full health, but due to Life Orb recoil it can still be picked off. It fears Sucker Punch from Pawniard and Mightyena, as well as Dodrio's Quick Attack when at lower health. It also fears priority Encore and Thunder Wave from Volbeat and Murkrow, as these can all stop a sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance activates Golduck's Swift Swim, doubling its Speed, and boosts its Water-type moves greatly. Hydro Pump, especially when boosted by rain, is able to KO most neutral targets. Ice Beam is necessary to hit Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, which resist Golduck's STAB attacks. Psyshock provides neutral damage to Water-types as well as dealing more damage to Roselia. If Golduck is already on a rain team with rain support, it can run Surf instead of Rain Dance for an accurate alternative to Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Golduck to outspeed Choice Scarf Raichu with Swift Swim in place and to Speed tie with other Golduck and Articuno outside of rain. Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature along with a Life Orb allow Golduck to hit as hard as possible, KOing Tangela with Ice Beam after damage from Stealth Rock. Swift Swim is necessary in order to gain a Speed boost in rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golduck should primarily be used as a late game cleaner, to KO the opponent's remaining Pokemon after they have been weakened. On a rain team, Golduck can also be used as a wallbreaker as those teams have many other options to sweep with. Hydro Pump should be the main move to spam, as this is Golduck's strongest move and it gains a boost from rain and STAB. Avoid keeping Golduck in on strong priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Pawniard, as it can be easily KOed after Life Orb recoil. Golduck has decent bulk, but it should not set up on strong attackers that can KO it such as Ursaring. Golduck shouldn't be switching in on most attacks, but it can be brought in safely through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from a Pokemon such as Probopass or Vullaby. Golduck can also be used as a simple attacker to revenge kill slower Pokemon such as Stoutland and Golem if it does not get the opportunity to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golduck pairs well with special wallbreakers, such as Nasty Plot Ninetales and Simisear, which can lure in and weaken special walls such as Audino and Clefairy, which check Golduck. Pokemon such as Gabite, Golem, and Roselia can set up entry hazards to wear down Pokemon that can otherwise take a hit. Toxic Spikes also works great to wear down specially bulky pokemon such as Audino and Grumpig, which can take on Golduck. Water-types such as Politoed can be lured in and weakened by the likes of Ninetales. Electric- and Grass-types such as Raichu and Leafeon can handle said Water-types, while Flying-types such as Swanna and Dodrio can handle Grass-types. Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Leafeon can lure in and weaken Pokemon such as Roselia and Clefairy. Healing Wish support from Mr. Mime is also helpful because Golduck gets worn down fairly easy. Slower Pokemon with Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Probopass and Vullaby, can be helpful to get Golduck in safely without it having to take unnecessary damage. Although only needed on dedicated rain teams, Pokemon such as Volbeat and Electrode can set up Rain Dance and give Golduck a free switch with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Other Swift Swim Pokemon pair well with Golduck on a rain team, such as Beartic and Armaldo, as well as Pokemon such as Raichu, which can use a perfectly accurate Thunder in the rain.</p>"

  "Kadabra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kadabra is the best revenge killer that the tier has to offer thanks to the combination of Magic Guard, Focus Sash, and a fantastic movepool. It also makes a very strong Life Orb attacker. However, the Focus Sash set is slightly weak, and both sets have awful bulk. Kadabra is also outsped by a few threats despite its great Speed, and a vulnerability to Pursuit means it needs to be careful about having its Focus Sash broken or being outright KOed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used on the Focus Sash set to deal with defensive teams better, while Psych Up is a niche option that allows Kadabra to take advantage of setup sweepers. Signal Beam can be used over Shadow Ball to hit Dark-types, but most have a secondary typing that gives them a neutrality to Bug, making it mostly useless outside of hitting Mightyena and Zweilous.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Vullaby walls Kadabra that lack the rare Dazzling Gleam. Zweilous does a similar job but takes a lot of damage from Life Orb Kadabra's Hidden Power Fighting. Pawniard and Murkrow can trap Kadabra with Pursuit, breaking its Focus Sash if it carries one and OHKOing it if it does not. They can also force 50/50s with Sucker Punch, though Pawniard is OHKOed by Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Outside of Life Orb Psyshock, Kadabra struggles to do much to Pokemon such as Audino, Stunfisk, Bouffalant, and Camerupt. In return, these Pokemon can 2HKO Kadabra with an attack or paralyze it in the case of the former two. Bouffalant can also trap Kadabra with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Metang's Bullet Punch, Dodrio's Quick Attack, Basculin's Aqua Jet, and other priority moves can break Kadabra's Focus Sash or just do a huge amount of damage to it. Metang and Dodrio can also Pursuit trap Kadabra.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Kadabra's above average Speed, it can be taken out by faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Ninjask quite easily thanks to its terrible bulk. However, if Kadabra's Focus Sash is not broken, they risk getting paralyzed or taking a decent amount of damage. For this reason, Volt Switch or U-turn users like Zebstrika and Ninjask are good choices for dealing with Kadabra.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Kadabra's strong STAB move. To more reliably beat setup sweepers, Thunder Wave is necessary to cripple foes that can survive a Psychic. Shadow Ball allows Kadabra to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, while Hidden Power Fighting is used to hit Pawniard and Probopass. Encore can be used for Kadabra to deal with bulky setup sweepers as well as being generally helpful to lock foes into non-attacking moves. Calm Mind can also be used to set up on Encored foes, although Kadabra can easily be revenge killed, and Dazzling Gleam can be used to 2HKO Vullaby and OHKO Murkrow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Kadabra to more effectively revenge kill foes. Focus Sash lets Kadabra take any one hit from a sweeper and cripple or KO it. Magic Guard is essential for this to prevent Kadabra's Focus Sash being broken by entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kadabra should be preserved versus teams with setup sweepers such as Huntail and Raichu. Avoid sending it out if your opponent carries a Pursuit trapper such as Bouffalant to preserve its Focus Sash, and don't allow Pursuit trappers to switch into Kadabra, as most can avoid the 2HKO for a guaranteed Pursuit. Kadabra should paralyze setup sweepers that it cannot OHKO so it can get damage off on them and let a teammate finish them off. Examples include Shell Smash Gorebyss and Rock Polish Regice. Against bulkier teams Kadabra should focus on annoying foes with Thunder Wave and getting off as much damage as possible, as it won't be needed as a revenge killer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Kadabra set is best used on offensive teams that need a catch-all revenge killer. It also goes well with weaker teammates that can be setup fodder, such as Prinplup. Additionally, teams without Choice Scarf users could use the revenge killing support.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is Kadabra's main STAB move, and it is preferred over Psychic to deal more damage to specially bulky Pokemon such as Audino, Cryogonal, and Assault Vest Bouffalant. However, Psychic can still be used to deal more damage to Stunfisk. Shadow Ball hits opposing Psychic-types, while Hidden Power Fighting hits Pawniard and Probopass. The last slot depends on the team's needs; Taunt helps Kadabra take on bulkier teams more effectively by preventing defensive foes from recovering or setting entry hazards, while Substitute can help it dodge Thunder Wave and Sucker Punch. Dazzling Gleam can also be used to hit Vullaby, which would otherwise be a counter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs allow Kadabra to outspeed as many foes as possible while dealing maximum damage. Life Orb and Magic Guard work together to boost Kadabra's power and avoid recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kadabra cannot switch into most foes due to its awful bulk, but it can still come in on non-damaging moves such as Stealth Rock and weak foes such as Stunfisk. Once Kadabra is safely on the field, it should aim to deal as much damage as possible with its strong attacks. While this can be risky, Kadabra can attempt to bluff a Focus Sash and attain surprise KOs after tricking opponents into switching out boosted sweepers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Kadabra set is best used on offensive teams that can already handle setup sweepers reliably. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Venipede and Golem helps to wear down Kadabra's foes. Vullaby lures such as Swords Dance + Return Leafeon and Swords Dance Bouffalant are also appreciated if Kadabra is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p>"

  "Weepinbell": {
    "overview": "<p>Weepinbell's decent Special Attack stat and decent coverage allow it to perform as a terrifying sun sweeper. Weepinbell also has access to Sleep Powder, allowing it to cripple bulky switch-ins such as Grumpig. However, Weepinbell is extremely frail, making it vulnerable to priority from Pokemon such as Cacturne, and making it difficult for it to set up Growth. It also faces competition from other sun sweepers such as Sawsbuck and Tangela, which have better bulk. Weepinbell's low Speed stat outside of Chlorophyll means that it only fits on sun teams, as it relies on sun to sweep, and even with sun up it is outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime, Dodrio, and Floatzel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed attacking set could work, but it is outclassed by Simisage, which is faster outside of sun and has a more powerful STAB move in Leaf Storm. Eviolite allows Weepinbell to tank hits and to set up a Growth more easily, but it loses out on power. Giga Drain is an option for recovery, but it is significantly weaker than Solar Beam. Knock Off allows Weepinbell to hit Psychic-types such as Grumpig and to remove Eviolite from Pokemon such as Zweilous and Vullaby, but it is generally better off with its coverage options. Sucker Punch has priority and allows Weepinbell to pick off frail Pokemon such as Kadabra, but it is very weak and has little use outside of that. Synthesis is an option for reliable recovery, as Weepinbell is easily worn down by Life Orb recoil, but it means that Weepinbell misses out on a coverage move. Substitute allows Weepinbell to avoid status such as burn and paralysis, but it wears it down even more when combined with Life Orb recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sleep Absorbers</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to Sleep Powder, such as Roselia and Quilladin, are able to switch into Weepinbell reliably. Quilladin in particular, is immune to Sleep Powder due to its Grass typing, is immune to both Weather Ball and Sludge Bomb because of Bulletproof, and can set up Spikes on Weepinbell while healing itself with Synthesis. However, the former don't enjoy being crippled by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls</strong>: Bulky walls such as Grumpig and Audino are able to tank Weepinbell's attacks and can phaze it with Whirlwind and Roar, respectively, if it carries Growth. Grumpig can also cripple Weepinbell with Thunder Wave. However, they both hate being crippled by Sleep Powder. Muk can absorb sleep thanks to Sleep Talk and can weaken Weepinbell with Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mr. Mime and Dodrio, are able to outspeed Weepinbell and OHKO it with their respective STAB moves. Sawsbuck can switch in on Sleep Powder thanks to Sap Sipper and can KO Weepinbell with Double Edge. Jumpluff also has Chlorophyll to outspeed Weepinbell and can KO it with Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Although they can't switch in, strong priority attackers such as Cacturne, Pawniard, and Dusknoir are able to severely cripple Weepinbell and limit the amount of turns it gets to attack, with the former two having Sucker Punch and the latter having Shadow Sneak.</p>",

      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Solar Beam allows Weepinbell to hit Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Golem, Lumineon, and Stunfisk, and it is Weepinbell's most spammable move, hitting most targets for solid damage. Sludge Bomb allows Weepinbell to hit Grass-types that resist Solar Beam, such as Tangela and Leafeon, for super effective damage, and Fire-types, such as Monferno and Rapidash, for neutral damage, and it is also Weepinbell's only attack that works outside of sun. Weather Ball allows Weepinbell to hit Roselia, Gourgeist-XL, and Steel-types such as Pawniard and Klang for super effective damage when sun is up. Sleep Powder puts specially defensive walls such as Grumpig and Audino to sleep, allowing Weepinbell to 2HKO or 3HKO them more easily, and it also allows Weepinbell to deal with Sucker Punch users, such as Pawniard and Golem. Growth is an option over Sleep Powder so that Weepinbell can sweep more easily and get past special walls such as Grumpig, but it finds it hard to set up Growth because of its low bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread combined with a Modest nature maximizes Weepinbell's sweeping abilities and allows it to outspeed as much as possible during sun. Chlorophyll is the chosen ability in order for Weepinbell to outspeed threats during sun. Life Orb maximizes Weepinbell's damage output and allows it to hit as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weepinbell should not be attempting to sweep outside of sun, as it is very slow outside of it, and it should only be switching in on Grass-type attacks, Toxic, or on free switches. Weepinbell is great for breaking walls early- to mid-game, but it is also useful for cleaning up late-game. If Weepinbell has Sleep Powder, it should use it on special walls that it has trouble getting past, such as Audino, or on Sucker Punch users, like Pawniard. If Weepinbell has Growth, it should set up on Pokemon that cannot do much to it, such as Tangela and Roselia. Weepinbell also should be wary of faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mr. Mime and strong priority attacks from Pokemon such as Cacturne, as they can deal quite a bit of damage to Weepinbell and limit the amount of turns it gets to attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weepinbell should only be used on sun teams, as it relies on Chlorophyll to sweep. A sun setter, such as Onix or Golem, is absolutely mandatory to provide Stealth Rock and sun support in order for Weepinbell to sweep. Volbeat provides both Sunny Day support and a slow U-turn in order to get Weepinbell safely on the field. Other Chlorophyll users, such as Sawsbuck and Leafeon, pair well with Weepinbell and appreciate Weepinbell's ability to breaking through walls to help them sweep late-game. Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Monferno, benefit from the sun and can switch into Fire-type attacks if necessary. A Pokemon that can check Jumpluff, such as Zebstrika, is beneficial, as Chlorophyll Jumpluff threatens to outspeed and KO Weepinbell with Acrobatics.</p>"

  "Tentacool": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacool is used as a utility-focused Pokemon on defensively oriented teams thanks to a few niches that make it unique among specially defensive walls and Rapid Spinners. Tentacool's high Special Defense along with Eviolite and its strong defensive typing allow it to check common special attackers such as Simipour and Floatzel and reliably remove Toxic Spikes, which troubles defensive teams. Tentacool has another niche in its great support movepool with access to moves such as Scald, Knock Off, and Rapid Spin, which make it versatile, threatening even to defensively oriented teams, and not totally passive, along with others such as Haze, which allow it to not be setup fodder. Tentacool also has access to Toxic Spikes, another important utility tool to wear down foes, which gives it a niche over other bulky Water-types such as Pelipper and Frillish; however, Pelipper has access to recovery, so it's preferred most of the time. Moreover, Tentacool's lack of an offensive presence and mediocre Defense mean that it's easy to wear down, loses to every spinblocker, and is not reliable as a wall, so it has to fight for a teamslot and it's still hard to fit on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive spread with a Bold nature can be run to make up for Tentacool's poor Defense while retaining decent Special Defense; however, it will still struggle against strong physical attackers such as Stoutland. Giga Drain can be used to hit Water-types such as Simipour and Lapras while recovering some damage, though Toxic already provides a good enough answer to them. Acid Spray allows Tentacool to better deal with bulky Calm Mind-using setup sweepers such as Clefairy; however, most of the time, Haze is preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Duosion, Grumpig, and Beheeyem can tank a few hits from Tentacool and retaliate with a super effective STAB move or use Tentacool as a setup fodder; however, Haze and Toxic can be annoying. Kadabra finds it difficult to set up because of its frailty, though it still can easily KO Tentacool with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu can threaten Tentacool with their STAB moves and can easily tank Scald, though they won't appreciate getting their item removed by Knock Off or getting burned or poisoned, as they can be easily worn down.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Gabite and Golem prefer to not switch on Scald, as they risk being burned and it deals solid damage. They can, however, OHKO Tentacool with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Mightyena can KO Tentacool easily with their STAB moves because of its poor Defense. They hate Scald burns, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because of its lack of reliable recovery, Tentacool is quickly worn down by entry hazards and burns, so it has to be wary when switching into Scald and Will-O-Wisp, as well as when Spikes or Stealth Rock are up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Tentacruel's main STAB move and is used mainly to spread burns. Toxic Spikes wears foes down and allows teammates to break through or stall out bulky Pokemon. Haze resets stat boosts, allowing Tentacool to not be setup fodder. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards on your side of the field, which is helpful if a teammate is weak to entry hazards. Knock Off comes in handy to remove items from foes, especially from Eviolite users such as Clefairy. Toxic is a valid option to cripple foes and allow Tentacool to deal with Pokemon that take little damage from its moves or are immune to them, such as Lapras.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense along with a Calm nature allow Tentacool to tank special attacks with ease. Liquid Ooze causes health-draining moves to deal damage to the user instead of recovering it. Liquid Ooze can come in handy against Leech Seed and Giga Drain users such as Tangela and Roselia. Eviolite further increases Tentacool's bulk and makes up a bit for its mediocre Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacool should not be switched in against strong physical attackers, as they can easily KO it due to its mediocre Defense. Tentacool should set up only one layer of Toxic Spikes against offensive teams to keep up the pressure, while two layers are needed against bulkier teams to wear down and break through walls. Scald and Knock Off should be used early- and mid-game to spread burns and cripple foes. Tentacool has to switch in and use Rapid Spin mainly against special attackers such as Simipour and Floatzel because of its high Special Defense along with Eviolite. Toxic Spikes have to be used as early as possible to cripple and wear down foes from the start; however, if the opponent carries a grounded Poison-type, it isn't worth setting them up. Tentacool should be preserved to remove entry hazards if its teammates are weak to them, especially against entry hazard stacking teams. If the opponent carries a Ghost-type, Tentacool should use Knock Off on the predicted switch-in to wear it down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tentacool fits on defensively oriented and balanced teams because of the amount of utility it can provide and because it provides a check to common special attackers such as Simipour, which trouble defensive teams. Entry hazard stacking teams also benefit from Tentacool's ability to set up Toxic Spikes to further wear down the opposing team. Examples of other entry hazard setters are Stunfisk, Clefairy, and Quilladin. Bulky Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL have decent type synergy with Tentacool and can tank Ground-type moves for it. Ground-types such as Gabite and Stunfisk are immune to Electric-type moves and can stop VoltTurn cores created by Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu, which trouble Tentacool with their STAB moves. Lickilicky and Hypno can provide Wish support to Tentacool, giving it a way to recover damage taken and allowing it to stay alive for longer. Pokemon that are vulnerable to entry hazards such as Rotom-F and Tangela appreciate Tentacool's Rapid Spin support. Pokemon with high physical bulk, such as Tangela, Stunfisk, and Gourgeist-XL, can protect Tentacool from physical attacks and absorb Knock Off with relative ease. Dark-types such as Mightyena and Pawniard can deal with Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir that find themselves switching in against Tentacool to prevent it from removing entry hazards. Dark-types can also threaten Psychic-types such as Duosion and Grumpig, while Pawniard can trap Ghost-types thanks to Pursuit. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly deter the use of Defog, keeping Toxic Spikes on the field. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir can prevent Rapid Spin users such as Armaldo and Torkoal from removing Toxic Spikes.</p>"

While it faces competition from the plethora of other Stealth Rock setters in the tier, its higher offensive presence, ability to run two separate effective sets, and strong STAB combination give it a solid niche. It can also make up for its poor Speed with either Sucker Punch or Custap Berry, and it has solid defensive typing to check common threats such as Stoutland and Dodrio. However, it has a slew of weaknesses, including double weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type moves. Its offensive presence is limited by the number of bulky Pokemon in the metagame, especially Water- and Grass-types. It also has no reliable forms of recovery, meaning it can't act as a physical wall and switch repeatedly into attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Jolly nature can be run on the lead set to outspeed defensive Pokemon that occasionally run enough Speed creep for Golem such as Pelipper, but doing so comes with a significant drop of Attack. Thanks to Sturdy, Counter can be used to get rid of physical attackers after Golem gets hit by a powerful attack. Rock Polish boosts Speed, making Golem more threatening and allowing it to outspeed almost the whole tier, but such a set is somewhat weak and will still be outsped by Electrode, Ninjask, and Choice Scarf users. The tank set can run an alternative spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def if the Special Defense investment is unwanted. It can also run 44 Speed EVs to outrun uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Audino and Carbink.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Gogoat, Gourgeist-XL, and Tangela resist Golem's STAB attacks and can switch into it and either OHKO it with their STAB attacks or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Floatzel and Swanna cannot safely switch into Golem but can OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks as long as Golem's Sturdy is broken by Stealth Rock or other means. Floatzel can also play around Sucker Punch and Custap Berry with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor is capable of tanking anything Golem can throw at it, save Choice Banded Fire Punch, and setting up Stealth Rock or crippling Golem with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Golem can threaten common hazard removers such as Vullaby and Armaldo quite well, but once it has been KOed they can remove its hazards, keeping Stealth Rock off of the opposing side of the field permanently.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Leads</strong>: Bullet Seed Leafeon and Mold Breaker Rampardos are able to OHKO Golem regardless of Sturdy. Taunt users, such as Misdreavus, Vigoroth, and Grumpig, can stop Golem from setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon with super effective coverage, such as Raichu, Ninetales, and Zebstrika, can normally OHKO Golem, though Golem can survive a hit thanks to Sturdy and might have a Weakness Policy.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears down the opposing Pokemon as they switch in, breaking Focus Sashes and Sturdy alike. Golem gets up Stealth Rock fairly reliably thanks to Sturdy, which allows it to set up the hazard without fear of being OHKOed. Due to Golem's naturally high Attack stat, Earthquake OHKOs many Pokemon that are weak to or take neutral damage from it. Stone Edge works very well with Earthquake, as it hits most of the Pokemon in the tier that are immune to or resist Ground. Toxic is able to wear down many common Pokemon that switch into Golem, such as Gourgeist-XL and Tangela. Sucker Punch can be used as a form of priority and can KO many Pokemon that are at low HP. Protect is another option for the final moveslot, although less useful than Toxic or Sucker Punch in general. Protect helps scout for the opposing Pokemon's set, such as whether an opposing Floatzel is a physical or special attacker, or what move the opposing Pokemon will go for if it holds a Choice item. Protect also allows Golem to get more passive recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs in HP along with 224 EVs in Special Defense give Golem incredible mixed bulk. A Careful nature is used to maximize Special Defense. These EVs let Golem survive four uses of Hidden Power Ice from Life Orb Zebstrika after Leftovers most of the time. The 32 Attack EVs are needed in order to OHKO Pawniard with Earthquake. Finally, Sturdy is preferred in order to ensure Golem gets up Stealth Rock, especially versus Water- and Grass-types that would normally be able to OHKO Golem with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though this set is specially defensive, Golem also has a naturally high Defense and can come in on many Pokemon that simply don't have a way to hit it super effectively, such as Flying-types like Chatot, Vullaby, and Ninjask. Take advantage of opportunities where the opposing Pokemon switches out to set up Stealth Rock. In addition, keeping Golem's Sturdy intact is a valuable asset, as this can let Golem get a Toxic or attack off on an opposing Pokemon late-game, ultimately allowing other Pokemon on your team to KO it with damage over time. Use Golem's great Attack stat to your advantage. There are many Pokemon that Golem can take a hit from and KO in return, especially due to Sturdy. Even if you do not want Golem to be severely weakened, this can sometimes be good if you are able to KO a big threat to your team. It is best to get up Stealth Rock early so that it it hits as many Pokemon as possible on the switch in. In addition, Golem can switch into most Electric-types to prevent them from Volt Switching out, hindering their momentum. They usually run Hidden Power Ice, which Golem can take fine, but be wary of surprise Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Water.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Golem set fits well on balance teams as part of defensive cores due to its high mixed defenses. Golem is normally checked or countered by bulky Grass- and Water-types, which can easily take one of its attacks and retaliate with their respective 4x super effective STAB moves. Pokemon that remedy this weakness are great partners for Golem, such as Grass-types like Gourgeist-XL and Tangela and Water-types like Lapras and Politoed. In addition, because Golem is immune to Electric-type attacks, it works well with Pokemon that need fast Electric-types removed, such as Chatot, Dodrio, and Articuno. Grumpig is a great partner due to the fact that it threatens Monferno and Ice-types such as Rotom-F. Grumpig also has access to Thunder Wave, which slows down foes for Golem to KO with Earthquake or Stone Edge. Because Golem is such a great check to Flying- and Rock-types, it pairs well with Pokemon that need them removed in order to sweep, such as Jumpluff and Ninjask. Finally, sweepers and wallbreakers that appreciate Stealth Rock, such as Ninetales and Floatzel, are great partners for Golem.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Golem is capable of performing as a very strong wallbreaker with its powerful EdgeQuake combination. Earthquake is Golem's STAB move of choice, as it has perfect accuracy and is easy to spam when Ground-resistant or -immune Pokemon are not present or have been eliminated. Stone Edge is Golem's secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon that resist or are immune to Earthquake, such as Misdreavus, Solrock, and Leafeon, for good damage. Sucker Punch hits faster Pokemon that Golem would otherwise be unable to touch. Fire Punch is an important coverage move that hits the likes of Bronzor and bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist and Tangela when you don't want to risk a Stone Edge. Superpower is the preferred final coverage move so that Golem is able to hit Pokemon such as Air Balloon Probopass and Vibrava. Explosion is also an option in the last slot, as it deals an insane amount of damage to typical Golem switch-ins and even OHKOes Vibrava from full HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread simply maximizes Attack and Speed for Golem. The Speed is necessary to outspeed every foe up to uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon. Adamant is the nature of choice because it allows Golem to hit as hard as possible with a Choice Band. However, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed foes that Speed creep Adamant Golem such as Pelipper and Mawile. Lastly, Sturdy allows Golem to take any one hit from full health and also ensures that Golem will be able to fire off at least one attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Golem is best played as a wallbreaker, dealing lots of damage to otherwise safe switch-ins with its powerful STAB Earthquake and Stone Edge. Once Golem has switched in, simply pick the move that's most effective against the likely switch-in in order to 2HKO it most of the time. Both of Golem's STAB moves have some drawbacks to using them; Earthquake is perfectly accurate, but it can leave Golem checked by physically defensive Grass-types and Pokemon immune to Ground, and Stone Edge has imperfect accuracy even though nothing is immune to Rock. Once Flying-types, Levitate users, and bulky Grass-types have been removed from battle, however, it's very easy for Golem to simply spam Earthquake. Only use Fire Punch if attempting to predict a Bronzor switch-in or trying to secure a KO on a Grass-type switch-in. Bringing in Golem on a passive Pokemon that does not threaten it will give you a lot of momentum for Golem to continue wallbreaking. Golem should be supported by some sort of slow U-turn or Volt Switch pivot backbone that allows it to be brought in with minimal wear. Golem can also function as an offensive Normal- and Flying-type check, as well as Electric-type immunity, but without bulk investment, Golem can be worn down more easily by attacks like Choice Band Stoutland's Return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Golem fits best on offensive and balanced teams. Just like with a number of other wallbreakers, having a late-game sweeper is ideal in order to take advantage of the holes Golem punches, so Floatzel, Bouffalant, and Dragon Dance Altaria are good teammates. Grumpig is a solid pivot to fall back on due to its Fighting- and Ice-type resistances, and it can provide paralysis support to improve Golem's effectiveness against faster teams. Stealth Rock is helpful because it ensures Gourgeist and Tangela are 2HKOed by Stone Edge and Fire Punch, and it also chips down most Earthquake switch-ins very quickly. Prinplup and Clefairy are notable thanks to their decent defensive synergy with Golem. Other good partners for Golem are Lumineon, Politoed, Yache Berry Leafeon, and faster Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Choice Scarf Rotom-F, as they check the Water-types that force out Golem and also provide momentum for Golem with Volt Switch, and can wear down Grass-types with Overheat and Blizzard.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears down opposing teams with residual damage and breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy. STAB Stone Edge and Earthquake cover a lot of threats and hit hard. Rock Blast may be used to break Substitutes and OHKO Focus Sash Kadabra, but it is weaker and less reliable overall even when factoring in Stone Edge's poor accuracy. Explosion prevents spinners and Defoggers, such as Armaldo and Pelipper, from removing Stealth Rock and provides momentum for the team. It also weakens common checks to your team so that another Pokemon can clean later on. Sucker Punch can be used to pick off weakened but faster Pokemon, and it should be run with Weakness Policy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy allows Golem to survive at least one hit in order to set up Stealth Rock.  A Custap Berry can be run to let Golem use Explosion or fire off another strong attack after Sturdy has activated, which is useful against faster Pokemon. A Weakness Policy, on the other hand, allows it to make use of its weaknesses by discouraging the use of super effective moves when Golem is at full HP and helps deal more damage, particularly with Sucker Punch. Maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed everything up to uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Politoed. An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allow Golem to deal more damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golem is best used as a lead, as Sturdy will always be intact at the start of the match. Its main role is setting Stealth Rock up as soon as possible. It can also be used mid-game, as it can check Flying-, Normal-, and Electric-types. Even though Golem is a Ground-type, it can't properly counter Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Electrode, as they commonly carry coverage such as Hidden Power Ice. Use Explosion in front of slower Rapid Spin users and Defoggers in order to prevent them from removing entry hazards. Watch out for Mold Breaker Rampardos and Bullet Seed Leafeon, which can easily OHKO through Sturdy. Golem should not be considered a reliable check to offensive threats, as without HP investment, Golem's bulk is mediocre at best. You can also switch Golem in many times in order to get it to Custap Berry range. Be wary of using Stealth Rock against faster Pokemon with Taunt, such as Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golem is one of the best Stealth Rock setters for hyper offensive teams, as it is relatively quick and powerful, and you can usually maintain Stealth Rock because of Explosion. It can be paired with a Ghost-type, such as Misdreavus, in order to block Rapid Spin, and possibly a Defiant user, such as Pawniard or Purugly, to benefit from Defog, as you'll often get only one chance to set Stealth Rock. Other entry hazard setters, such as Roselia, can be used to further increase the residual damage and create nice entry hazard-stacking cores. Powerful attackers, such as Zebstrika, Ninetales, and Sawsbuck, appreciate entry hazard support. Ninetales and Zebstrika, in particular, are great partners, as they're able to deal with bulky Grass- and Water-types.</p>"

      "Sun Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sunny Day gives an appreciated Speed boost to teammates that carry Chlorophyll, such as Sawsbuck and Leafeon, and powers up Fire-type moves, making Pokemon such as Ninetales and Simisear more threatening. Stealth Rock wears down foes and breaks Sturdy and Focus Sashes and therefore is fundamental to further support teammates. Explosion is the strongest move at Golem's disposal and can heavily damage the target, though it is mainly used to not waste Sunny Day turns, gain momentum, and block Defog and Rapid Spin after setting up Stealth Rock. Earthquake can be used to deal with opposing leads such as opposing Golem and Probopass or threatening setup sweepers without having to resort to Explosion. Stone Edge can be used over Earthquake if the team needs different coverage, and, while less reliable, it can hit Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Flying-types such as Swanna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread along with a Jolly nature is used to deal as much damage as possible and set up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock as fast as possible, outspeeding Defog users such as Pelipper and Vullaby. Sturdy allows Golem to survive a strong hit and set up one of Sunny Day and Stealth Rock safely. Heat Rock is used to make Sunny Day last as long as possible, letting teammates take advantage of it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Golem set has to be used has a lead, as it has a good matchup against most other leads and it has to set up both Sunny Day and Stealth Rock as soon as possible. Golem's main tasks are setting up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Golem should give more priority to setting up Stealth Rock than Sunny Day in order to waste fewer Sunny Day turns. After setting up Stealth Rock and possibly Sunny Day, Golem should use Explosion to not waste Sunny Day turns and to block Defog and Rapid Spin attempts from opponents. Earthquake or Stone Edge could be used when up against setup sweepers that don't fear Explosion such as Pawniard and Misdreavus. Golem should be wary of faster Taunt users such as Misdreavus, as they can prevent it from setting up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock. Golem also has to be careful when facing other anti-leads such as Mold Breaker Rampardos and Bullet Seed Leafeon, as they can OHKO regardless of Sturdy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sun lead Golem fits only on dedicated sun teams because of its offensive presence and the support it is able to provide to Chlorophyll users and Fire-types. As Golem will most of the time be gone during early-game, a secondary Sunny Day setter, such as Volbeat, is appreciated to support teammates more extensively. Chlorophyll users such as Leafeon and Sawsbuck greatly appreciate the Sunny Day support provided by Golem, as it gives them a big boost in Speed, allowing them to open holes into the opposing team from the start. They also appreciate Stealth Rock support to wear down foes and score more KOs on Pokemon such as Rapidash, Raichu, Rotom-F, and Pelipper. Fire-types such as Ninetales and Simisear also like the Sunny Day support, as it powers up their STAB moves, making them even more threatening on the offensive side along with Stealth Rock. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus are able to block Rapid Spin and keep Stealth Rock on the opposing field and therefore are good choices as partners for Golem. Defiant users such as Pawniard are also good partners for Golem, as they deter the use of Defog from the opponent. However, these are somewhat niche choices for sun teams.</p>"

  "Rapidash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rapidash has a niche as one of the few pure physical Fire-types in PU, and it is the best one, as it has superior coverage, higher Speed, and access to instant recovery in Morning Sun over the stronger and bulkier Flareon. Rapidash fits very well on offensive and balanced teams due to its good Speed and Attack, as well as Flash Fire, which grants Rapidash a 1.5x boost to Flare Blitz if it switches into a Fire move. Rapidash also has access to good coverage moves such as Wild Charge and Drill Run to hit Pokemon hard that resist Flare Blitz. Rapidash's typing is occasionally useful, as coupled with Flash Fire, it makes it a great check to offensive Fire-types such as Ninetales and certain Grass-types; however, it also leaves Rapidash weak to a lot of common attacking types such as Water and Ground and gives it a weakness to all entry hazards. This entry hazard weakness, coupled with recoil moves and low bulk, limits the amount of times Rapidash can switch in if it doesn't get an opportunity to use Morning Sun. Rapidash's coverage moves are also somewhat lacking in power without an item to boost them, but those boosting items come with their own disadvantages, such as extra recoil damage and locking Rapidash into one move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Megahorn hits bulky Psychic-types such as Duosion, Grumpig, and Solrock for huge damage, which would otherwise be a check and counters, respectively. Flame Charge makes it easier for Rapidash to clean up late-game. The combination of Sunny Day + Solar Beam works well, as it gives Rapidash a better chance to defeat bulky Rock-types such as Golem and Relicanth. Rapidash can act as a revenge killer with a Choice Scarf or hit much harder with a Choice Band. Neither is preferred, however, as Rapidash relies highly on its coverage to function.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Golem, Relicanth, and Solrock can take at least one Drill Run, or in the latter's case are immune to it, and KO Rapidash in return with their Rock STAB attack. They can also set up Stealth Rock against Rapidash.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Stunfisk can take a hit from Rapidash and either KO it with their STAB moves or cripple it with status. However, due to a lack of a Fire resistance they often cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Purugly, Raichu, and Floatzel can outspeed Rapidash and can take care of it with their STAB moves. It doesn't matter if they hit Rapidash for super effective damage or not, as Rapidash is quite frail and easy to wear down.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Strong or super effective priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Quick Attack from Mightyena and Dodrio can take care of Rapidash with just a little prior damage, which is very easy to get, as Rapidash gets worn down really easily.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to a weakness to all entry hazards and the use of recoil moves, Rapidash tends to faint very fast if it does not get an opportunity to use Morning Sun.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a strong STAB move that can get a Flash Fire boost if Rapidash switches into a Fire attack. Wild Charge is necessary coverage to hit Water-types such as Pelipper and Politoed for super effective damage, which would otherwise wall Rapidash. Drill Run hits Fire-types such as Ninetales and Heatmor, which Rapidash checks with Flash Fire, as well as Rock-types such as Golem. Will-O-Wisp is an option over Drill Run because most Fire-types are already 2HKOed by Wild Charge and most, if not all, bulky Rock-types are crippled by burns. Morning Sun recovers the health Rapidash loses from entry hazards and recoil and avoids Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread, along with a Jolly nature, maximizes Rapidash's Speed so it can revenge kill a fair amount of Pokemon in PU, such as Simipour, Dodrio, and Ninetales. Maximum Attack investment allows Rapidash to hit as hard as possible. Charcoal is the preferred item, as it grants Rapidash a 1.2 boost to Flare Blitz without causing additional recoil damage and allows Rapidash to bluff a Choice item. Leftovers can be used because two out of three of Rapidash's attacking moves cause recoil and it has a weakness to all entry hazards, so recovering some of the health Rapidash loses is useful. Life Orb is an option to give a 1.3 boost to all of Rapidash's attacking moves, but the added recoil and the fact that Rapidash will mostly be using Flare Blitz anyway often makes it an inferior option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is important to predict very well early-game, as removing Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Golem and Politoed is essential if you want to clean up with Rapidash. Rapidash does have the coverage to hit them, but it needs to hit most Fire-resistant Pokemon on the switch, as it cannot OHKO them. Use Morning Sun on predicted switches to recover the health Rapidash loses due to recoil and entry hazards. Pivot Rapidash into Fire-types, such as Simisear and Ninetales, and defensive Ghost-types that use Will-O-Wisp, such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, as it can get a Flash Fire boost from Fire moves and defeat opposing Fire-types with Drill Run. Switching into anything else than a resisted or very weak attack is usually a bad idea, as Rapidash's bulk is quite mediocre; Rapidash should often only be brought in to revenge kill Pokemon it outspeeds. Rapidash works best against balanced teams, as it can often break their defensive cores with its strong attacks and good coverage and has the Speed to outrun a lot of offensive threats as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapidash fits well on offensive teams that struggle with Grass-types or with Ninetales. Entry hazard removers such as Pelipper and Vibrava are good teammates because Rapidash is vulnerable to all kinds of entry hazards. Rapid Spin users are especially good partners because Rapidash appreciates entry hazards on the opponent's side. Grass-types such as Roselia and Jumpluff are good teammates because they cover Rapidash's Water and Ground weaknesses and hit Rock-types for super effective damage. In return, Rapidash checks Ice- and Fire-types such as Regice and Ninetales. Water-types can defeat Ground- and Rock-types for Rapidash. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Golem and Venipede are valuable, as they make it easier for Rapidash to KO Pokemon. Slow users of U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Pelipper and Probopass, can bring Rapidash in safely without having to risk it taking heavy damage.</p>"

Dewgong has access to Perish Song, which allows it to force out opposing Pokemon, but this means that it has to repeatedly switch in and out, and its weakness to Stealth Rock does not help it. In addition to this, Dewgong lacks a source of reliable recovery outside of Rest, and it cannot run an offensive set, as it is outclassed by other offensive Water-types such as Simipour and Floatzel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard are able to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Kadabra, but they are quite weak. Drill Run allows Dewgong to hit Electric-types such as Zebstrika, but Dewgong lacks the moveslot for it and Dewgong has a poor attack stat. Substitute could be used to block status such as burn and poison, but it wears Dewgong down more quickly when combined with Stealth Rock damage. Rest combined with Sleep Talk could be used for recovery, but they are unreliable.

Surf prevents Dewgong from being complete Taunt bait and hits Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Ninetales, Hippopotas, and Golem super effectively. Ice Beam is an option over Surf that hits Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL super effectively. Perish Song allows Dewgong to force out setup sweepers that it cannot touch with Toxic, such as Clefairy and Duosion.

Leftovers provides passive recovery, as Dewgong lacks a reliable recovery move outside of Rest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dewgong should try not to switch in when Stealth Rock is up, as it loses quite a bit of health, and should avoid switching on status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, as they easily wear it down because of its lack of reliable recovery. Dewgong should try to switch in on predicted Fire-type and Ice-type attacks, but it should be wary of coverage moves such as Ninetales's Energy Ball. Dewgong's aim is to spread status to walls such as Grumpig with Toxic. Dewgong should also force out setup sweepers such as Clefairy and Duosion with Perish Song, which should be used in conjunction with Protect. Stalling foes with Protect and Toxic damage is also recommended, as this is Dewgong's only way of doing decent damage, and it can gain Leftovers recovery as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dewgong only fits on defensive teams because of its passive nature and ability to tank hits. Users of Defog and Rapid Spin such as Vibrava, Vullaby, and Armaldo are recommended in order to remove entry hazards such as Stealth Rock from the field and allow Dewgong to stay as healthy as possible. They can also switch in on Grass-type attacks for Dewgong. Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Camerupt are good teammates, as they can handle Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu for Dewgong and provide Stealth Rock support.

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk is a very viable Pokemon in the PU metagame due to its high Attack stat, good special bulk, and pure Poison typing. It's blessed with two fantastic STAB moves in Gunk Shot and Poison Jab as well as access to the elemental punches and even a priority move with Shadow Sneak. This combination of a fairly wide movepool and its well-placed stats allows it to function well as a wallbreaker, special wall, late-game sweeper, or just a simple tank. Muk also happens to be a great check to some of the PU metagame's most prominent Pokemon, including Rotom-F, Cacturne, and Clefairy. Unfortunately for Muk, Poison is not the greatest offensive typing, as it is resisted by the very common Ground- and Rock-types, and Steel-types are immune to it. This requires anyone using Muk to predict more often than they might with other Pokemon, oftentimes forcing it to rely on its much weaker coverage moves in order to deal with its switch-ins. In addition, its low Speed stat lets it down considerably; Shadow Sneak may make up for this to an extent, but it doesn't do enough damage to revenge kill much outside of physically frail Pokemon that are weak to Ghost and Pokemon that are already weakened. Lastly, Muk lacks any form of reliable recovery, meaning it must rely on Rest or the support of its teammates if it wants to survive in longer battles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch is a powerful option that can hit Rock-types and a few Steel-types that try to switch in on Muk, but it's incredibly reliant on prediction and can easily give your opponent free turns, so it's not recommended. Giga Drain could let Muk function as a lure for Golem and Relicanth, but it's pitifully weak even though it's 4x super effective. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Water-types super effectively, but Muk usually doesn't have issues with them. Power-Up Punch might be worth considering on the Assault Vest set, but Muk generally wants more immediate power and will likely be switching out a lot, meaning it loses its Attack boosts. Memento is an option, but there's no room for a utility move on any of Muk's sets, and faster Pokemon like Jumpluff make better use of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem, Gabite, and Vibrava can switch in on any of Muk's moves except Ice Punch and then threaten it out with STAB Earthquake. Camerupt can even switch in on Ice Punch and threatens it with Earth Power or a potential burn from Lava Plume.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Metang, Mawile, and Pawniard can all switch in on Gunk Shot and Ice Punch easily and can pose a huge threat to Muk with their strong physical attacks. Probopass can switch in on a Fire Punch too and do some damage with Earth Power or pivot out with Volt Switch to gain momentum. The CroMuk set is also completely walled by Steel-types.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Relicanth, Crustle, and Armaldo are all capable of switching in on Gunk Shot and scaring it out with their strong physical attacks. Solrock can switch in and burn Muk with Will-O-Wisp or 2HKO it with Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Powerful Psychic-type attackers such as Beheeyem, Grumpig, Mr. Mime, and Kadabra can pose a huge threat to Muk, but they can't switch in on it. They should also be wary of Shadow Sneak, which can easily KO them if they've already taken some damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Muk's Poison typing means it can't be poisoned, but all of Muk's sets other than CroMuk are severely crippled by the other status ailments, especially burn, as it halves its physical attacking power. Will-O-Wisp users such as Gourgeist and Misdreavus can tank a hit and burn Muk, making it much more manageable.</p>",

      "CroMuk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse increases Muk's relatively low physical bulk and already impressive Attack stat. Poison Jab is preferred here because it has higher PP and accuracy than Gunk Shot. Rest is Muk's only form of recovery, but it lets Muk set up without worrying about being burned or paralyzed. Sleep Talk prevents Muk from being dead weight while asleep and allows Muk to switch in on sleep-inducing moves with minimal consequences.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP and 8 Defense EVs allow Muk to live through Stoutlandâ€™s Choice Band-boosted Return after Stealth Rock damage. 12 EVs should be invested in Speed, so that when weakened, it is able to restore its HP via Rest before being KOed by neutral-natured, uninvested base 50s like Prinplup, Mawile, and Audino. The remainder of its EVs is allocated toward its special bulk; this level of investment makes setting up easier and helps Muk take on special attackers even in the early-game. Curse increases Defense anyway, so near maximum Special Defense investment and a Careful nature are needed to ensure well-rounded bulk for easier sweeping. Black Sludge gives Muk passive recovery, reducing its reliance on Rest and increasing its overall durability. Sticky Hold is necessary to prevent Trick/Switcheroo from affecting Muk, which would otherwise ruin sweeping chances. It also allows Muk to switch in on a few more threats, most notably Rotom-F.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Muk is most effective late-game after its checks are gone, but it can be used throughout the battle as a special wall, switch-in to Pokemon such as Clefairy, or status absorber. It is particularly important to avoid setting up Curse until all your opponent's Steel-types have been KOed, as they're immune to Muk's only attacking move. Once its checks and counters are out of the way, the best time for Muk to set up is against a defensive Pokemon that doesn't carry Taunt or a super effective attack, such as Clefairy, Tangela, or Audino. Otherwise, it can also set up on special attackers like Roselia, Cryogonal, and the Rotom formes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The CroMuk set tends to work best on defensive or balanced teams. Offensive teams need to apply pressure on the opponent throughout the battle, and CroMuk can't do that until it sets up. Probopass is a common partner for its Magnet Pull ability, allowing it to trap and eliminate most Steel-types quite easily. Pursuit trappers such as Metang, Stoutland, and Dusknoir play a similar role, as they are able to weaken or KO the offensive Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Muk, namely Mr. Mime, Kadabra, and Misdreavus. Additionally, their Ground- and Fighting-type coverage moves are helpful for removing the Rock- and Steel-types that either wall or threaten Muk, like Golem, Probopass, and Mawile. Bulky Grass-types are great partners due to their advantage against Ground-types, especially Golem. Tangela is particularly helpful because its Sleep Powder can give Muk an opportunity to set up. This set would also be appreciated on teams that are weak to Rotom-F, as Muk is a great all-around check to it. Finally, due to Muk's Sticky Hold ability, it pairs well with most defensive Pokemon that would be crippled by Trick/Switcheroo, such as Audino, Clefairy, and Vullaby.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Since this set is intended to do as much damage as possible, Gunk Shot is the preferred STAB move for its power. Shadow Sneak helps Muk overcome its low Speed and allows it to act as a revenge killer, although it's a fairly weak move. Fire Punch deals with Steel-types primarily, since they're immune to Gunk Shot. Common threats such as Pawniard, Metang, and Mawile would all counter Muk otherwise. Ice Punch is similarly used to deal with Ground-types, giving Muk a way to discourage them from switching in. Golem, Gabite, and other physically oriented Ground-types are especially threatening, so this move is needed to make sure Muk isn't Ground bait.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band, maximum Attack EVs, and an Adamant nature are all used to maximize Muk's wallbreaking ability. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP to allow Muk to survive more hits while it's wallbreaking. The ability is really a toss-up depending on what your team needs. Poison Touch can be useful to spread the poison status with Muk's contact moves to its switch-ins that aren't Steel- or Poison-type. Sticky Hold allows it to switch in on a predicted Trick or Switcheroo, but not using Poison Touch may make it more difficult to wear down Muk's checks over the course of a battle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Muk plays the role of a wallbreaker, blowing holes in the opponent's team. Unfortunately, Gunk Shot is fairly easy to switch in on due to Steel-, Rock-, and Ground-types being on nearly every team, so predicting which Pokemon your opponent will switch to will be a key part of the success of this set. Muk is bulky enough that it can check weaker special attackers like Zebstrika and force them out. This gives Muk the opportunity to wear down its own checks by hitting them when they switch in. Furthermore, Muk thrives against certain defensive Pokemon like Clefairy and Audino, so they are the ideal Pokemon for it to switch in on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Normal- or Flying-types like Stoutland, Dodrio, and Jumpluff all benefit from Muk as a teammate because they share checks. Pokemon like Golem, Stunfisk, and Metang are typically used to deal with these checks, but running Muk alongside a Normal- or Flying-type attacker places immense pressure on these checks throughout the battle, making it easier to wear them down. Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangela are great partners because they can switch in on and eliminate Ground-types. Water-types like Politoed and Floatzel are good for similar reasons, and Muk helps them by beating the Grass-types that would otherwise check them. Trappers are also a good choice; Probopass can trap opposing Steel-types, which allows Muk to lock into its STAB Gunk Shot more easily. Similarly, Pursuit trappers such as Stoutland and Dodrio are effective because they deal with the Psychic- and Ghost-types that check Muk. In general, having a Psychic check is always a good idea. Murkrow is a good offensive partner for its type synergy and ability to clean up after Muk wears down the opponent's team. Pawniard and Mightyena are also worth considering for similar reasons.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot is Muk's strongest move. It's a little inaccurate and has low PP, but the power is worth it. Shadow Sneak is reliable priority. It's fairly weak against targets that take neutral damage from it, but it can be a big threat to Psychic- and Ghost-types. Fire Punch is mainly used to hit Steel-types like Metang and Mawile super effectively. Ice Punch covers most Ground-types like Golem, Stunfisk, and Vibrava.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Assault Vest increases Muk's already high Special Defense, allowing it to take more hits and therefore survive longer to continue threatening the opponent's team. It also helps Muk act as a check to certain special attackers like Zebstrika and Floatzel. Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature help Muk do as much damage as possible. The rest of the EVs are dumped in HP to increase Muk's overall bulk and longevity. Poison Touch is generally the preferred ability so Muk has a chance to poison its switch-ins, but Sticky Hold can allow it to function as a switch-in to Trick or Switcheroo, and to a lesser extent, Knock Off. However, it's more difficult to wear down Muk's checks without the chance of poisoning them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Muk can be used throughout the battle to switch in on resisted attacks, as well as non-Psychic-type special attackers if necessary, and deal damage before being forced out. If using Sticky Hold, it can also act as a switch-in to Trick and Switcheroo for teammates that are very dependent upon their items or are just crippled by being given a Choice item. Since Gunk Shot has so many switch-ins in the PU tier, spamming it early on in the battle isn't always the best strategy. However, once Muk's checks have been eliminated, spamming Gunk Shot and Shadow Sneak can be an effective way of cleaning up. As a final note, if Muk is on your team to check a certain Pokemon such as Cacturne, be careful not to let it get too weak before that Pokemon is knocked out. Muk is very prone to being worn down over time, since it lacks recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The Assault Vest set tends to work best on bulky offensive or balanced teams that need a check to Grass-types, Clefairy, or just special attackers in general. Psychic-type checks, especially Dark-types like Vullaby, are appreciated on the team due to Muk's weakness to them. Muk can also switch in on Fairy and Fighting moves for Dark-types, so Cacturne, Pawniard, and Murkrow all appreciate Muk's presence. Ground-type checks are highly valued because most Ground-type attackers are physical, leaving Muk very vulnerable. As such, Flying-types or Levitate users such as Pelipper and Vibrava are ideal. Grass-types with STAB moves can also be very effective at switching in on and eliminating Ground-types. Since Fire Punch is Muk's only answer to Steel-types and it's not particularly strong, having a check to Steel-types is a good idea. Probopass can trap them with Magnet Pull and knock them out with Earth Power. Pursuit trappers like Stoutland, Dodrio, and Metang can remove Psychic- and Ghost-types from the opponent's team, both of which can be problematic for Muk. With Muk's lack of reliable recovery, having a cleric on the team is a good idea to keep it healthy. Audino's Wish and Heal Bell or Mr. Mime's Healing Wish are both solid options. Muk's resistance to Grass and nice special bulk make it a good partner for Water-types, particularly Seaking and Relicanth, since Grass is their most significant weakness.</p>"

  "Hypno": {
    "overview": "<p>Hypno differentiates itself from Audino, the most common Wish passer, with its Psychic typing and extensive support movepool Audino could only dream of, including Seismic Toss, Taunt, and Foul Play. However, Hypno also gives up Regenerator and is weak to Knock Off, which is quite detrimental considering that the types of teams Hypno wants to fit on usually include several Eviolite users such as Munchlax, Clefairy, and Vullaby. Furthermore, several of the Fighting-types such as Monferno and Combusken that Hypno wants to check more commonly run physical sets than special ones. Monferno in particular is nearly impossible for Hypno to check considering it's faster and commonly carries U-turn. These attributes make Audino much more consistent than Hypno at Wish passing. In extremely rare moments, however, Hypno can still shine as a Wish passer due to its above average bulk and key Fighting resistance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive EV spread with a Bold nature could theoretically improve Hypno's matchup against physical attackers. However, PU has far too many physical attackers to account for, and Hypno cannot sufficiently check all of them on its own. Additionally, even with a physically defensive spread, Hypno still loses to the majority of Knock Off users one-on-one. Bulkier, more specially offensive sets utilizing either Nasty Plot or Calm Mind face fierce competition with Beheeyem, which has access to Recover, Analytic, and much higher Special Attack. Belly Drum sets utilizing Zen Headbutt and Drain Punch might seem to make sense on a physically attacking Psychic-type; however, Hypno misses out on hitting opposing Psychic-types and has a relatively low Attack and Speed stats to try to pull off this endeavor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Bronzor, Probopass, and Metang are immune to Toxic and take next to no damage from Hypno's Psychic. However, all of them have fairly low HP stats and lack reliable recovery options, leaving them susceptible to Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Cacturne and Krokorok can muscle past Hypno's defensive capabilities with a super effective STAB attack, although Colbur Berry Hypno is slightly harder to defeat. Pawniard is especially notable for its Steel typing giving it an immunity to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Other Knock Off Users</strong>: Other prominent Knock Off users such as Leafeon and Dodrio can also severely dent Leftovers variants of Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Offensive Ghost-types such as Nasty Plot Misdreavus and Choice Band Trevenant can hit Hypno super effectively with their STAB attacks. Foul Play deals a lot of damage back to Dusknoir, however.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Rampardos, Ursaring, and Choice Specs Beheeyem can OHKO or 2HKO Hypno, while the best thing Hypno can do back is hit them with Foul Play if it happens to have it.</p>",

      "Wish Passer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish in combination with Protect allows Hypno to restore not only its own health but also the health of its teammates. Protect also gives Hypno additional Leftovers recovery and forces badly poisoned foes to take extra poison damage. Psychic is Hypno's strongest and most reliable STAB option, hitting Pokemon such as Combusken, Monferno, and Arbok super effectively. Alternatively, Seismic Toss ignores Hypno's subpar, uninvested Special Attack, dealing fixed damage to foes such as Bronzor and Clefairy that would take relatively little from Psychic. Taunt shuts down passive threats such as Bronzor and Audino. On the other hand, Toxic puts foes such as Stunfisk and Bouffalant on a timer, slowly draining away their health, while Foul Play gives Hypno counterplay options against physical attackers and wallbreakers such as Dusknoir and Stoutland.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs alongside a Calm nature allow Hypno to check special attackers such as Combusken and Tangela. Insomnia prevents Hypno from being put to sleep by common sleep inducers such as Smeargle, Jumpluff, and Tangela. Leftovers grants Hypno access to passive recovery, allowing it to avoid having to use Wish as often and gain additional recovery when following up Wish with Protect. On the other hand, a Colbur Berry ensures Hypno is able to survive at least one Dark-type attack from Pokemon such as Cacturne, Leafeon, and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hypno should switch into special attackers such as Zebstrika, Combusken, and Articuno and try to cripple them with attacks and poison. Hypno should utilize Wish in combination with Protect to keep itself at a sustainable amount of health so that it can continue to check the Pokemon it needs to check. One should also evaluate if Hypno is healthy enough to pass a Wish to one of its teammates, taking entry hazards and status into account. Be wary of Knock Off users such as Leafeon and Dodrio, especially if Hypno opts to utilize Leftovers over a Colbur Berry.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Switch-ins to Knock Off such as Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL and Carbink are extremely beneficial for Hypno and its teammates. Gourgeist-XL and Hypno also happen to make a decent defensive core together. Entry hazard removal from Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal and Defog users such as Vullaby and Vibrava can help ensure Hypno's overall longevity. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Heal Bell Altaria and Aromatherapy Roselia can alleviate status for Hypno and its teammates. Bulky sweepers that enjoy the Fighting and Psychic resistances Hypno provides, such as Munchlax and Muk, make for great teammates.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>A high Attack stat and access to Agility make Kingler a potent sweeper as well as a strong wallbreaker before setting up. Its solid coverage and access to Knock Off also make it fairly annoying to switch into. However, Kingler has trouble breaking through bulky Grass- and Water-types and faces competition from Relicanth, which has access to STAB Head Smash, and Huntail, which is far stronger after a Shell Smash. Kingler is also held back by its poor Special Defense, which makes it easy to pressure offensively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Wacan or Rindo Berry can give Kingler setup opportunities against a wider variety of Pokemon but leave it slightly weak. A Choice Band set is hard to switch into but outclassed by Basculin due to its access to priority moves and Adaptability. Lum Berry is a passable item to let Kingler set up on status users such as Misdreavus. Ice Beam can be run on a mixed Agility set to surprise Pokemon such as Altaria and Tangela. Sheer Force-boosted Rock Slide with a Life Orb is Kingler's most powerful coverage move, but Kingler lacks the moveslot for it. Return can be run over Superpower, as it has good neutral coverage alongside Crabhammer and 2HKOes Politoed without dropping Kingler's Attack. X-Scissor hits most Grass-types like Leafeon and Leavanny harder than Kingler's other moves, but it is notably weaker than Superpower otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Roselia, and Tangela are all capable of taking unboosted hits and can cripple or KO Kingler in return. Even more offensive Grass-types such as Jumpluff and Leafeon serve as good checks, although Jumpluff cannot OHKO Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Kingler is unable to break through bulky Water-types such as Politoed and Pelipper without good prediction, although it can KO Politoed with a Knock Off followed by a Superpower. Offensive Water-types such as Simipour and Floatzel can be KOed with Superpower, but they cannot be set up against if they run Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralysis both leave Kingler too crippled to wallbreak or sweep effectively. Although poison does not inhibit it as much, it can wear down Kingler quickly in tandem with Life Orb recoil and makes it more difficult to sweep late-game.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Despite Kingler's great Attack stat, bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy can survive a hit and cripple or KO Kingler to end its sweep.</p> <p><strong>Kadabra</strong>: Kadabra can end Kingler's sweep thanks to its combination of Magic Guard and Focus Sash, as it can OHKO Kingler nearly 100% of the time.</p>",

      "Agility Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility allows Kingler to boost its Speed and sweep through teams, and Crabhammer is its strongest STAB attack. Knock Off is Kingler's best coverage move and allows it to remove Eviolites from switch-ins such as Tangela and Vullaby. Superpower rounds out Kingler's coverage, allowing it to hit bulky Pokemon such as Politoed and Klang for more damage, although Swords Dance can be used instead to let Kingler boost through bulkier Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature let Kingler hit as hard as possible and sweep more effectively late-game, while maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier and all common Choice Scarf users while at +2 Speed. Splash Plate and Life Orb both boost Kingler's damage output; Splash Plate only benefits Crabhammer and has a lower multiplier but, unlike Life Orb, does not wear down Kingler with recoil. Hyper Cutter is the preferred ability to avoid Attack drops from rare Intimidate users such as Arbok.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kingler should be used as a late-game sweeper once its checks have been worn down, although it can cripple teams early-game with Knock Off and strong Crabhammers. Do not use Agility until opposing checks, such as Roselia, have been appropriately weakened. Due to Kingler's mediocre bulk, it should generally be brought in via slow U-turn or when a teammate has fainted. If you are running Swords Dance, only boost if Kingler is facing a Pokemon that it cannot otherwise break through, such as Vullaby or Politoed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can lure and cripple Grass-types and walls, such as Knock Off Simipour or offensive Gourgeist, help wear down teams for Kingler to sweep later. Kingler also pairs well with other physical sweepers such as Fraxure, as they can wear down each other's counters. Pokemon immune to Electric, such as Stunfisk, prevent Kingler from giving the opponent a free Volt Switch early-game. Kingler also appreciates Electric-type teammates to help pressure Water-types such as Pelipper. Entry hazard users such as Venipede, Roselia, and Stunfisk also help, as most of Kingler's checks are grounded and susceptible to passive damage. Jumpluff is also a notable partner, as it provides Memento support for Kingler to set up and can help to take down Tangela.</p>"

Marowak has a good offensive movepool that lets it function well as both a wallbreaker and an offensive Stealth Rock setter. However, if Marowak loses its Thick Club, it loses most of its usefulness. Its decent physical bulk is let down by its poor special bulk and weaknesses to common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks. While Marowak can circumvent its low Speed via Sticky Web, paralysis, or Trick Room support, Marowak is vulnerable to being easily revenge killed by most faster foes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is a possibility to boost Marowak's Attack even further, but it gives the opponent a free turn to hit Marowak for super effective damage or set up. Don't run any item other than Thick Club, as Marowak is outclassed by other Pokemon such as Golem when running another item. Fire Punch is another option for hitting Grass- and Ice-types more effectively, and most importantly 2HKO Tangela. Counter can be used to hit physical threats after they attack you, as Marowak can take physical hits, but Counter isn't really good as it doesn't do anything to special attackers. Toxic cripples defensive Pokemon such as Tangela and the Gourgeist formes, but they are crippled by Knock Off already.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types are really good checks to Marowak, as Marowak has a hard time standing up to them. Examples are Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, and though Knock Off is debilitating, they still wall Marowak and threaten it back effectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Pelipper and Prinplup, can take a hit and burn Marowak with Scald, though the former has to be wary of Stone Edge, meaning it can't safely switch in.</p> <p><strong>Specially Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good Special Attack can easily revenge kill Marowak, especially Pokemon with a typing advantage over it, such as Swanna.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp Users</strong>: Faster Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp can easily deal with Marowak, as they can burn it and stall it out or directly KO it, but they have to make sure Marowak does not have a Substitute up.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Item-removing attacks, such as Trick, Switcheroo, and Knock Off, remove Thick Club, making Marowak useless.</p> <p><strong>Avalugg</strong>: Avalugg has enough bulk to take a hit from Marowak and can KO it with Avalanche, though it cannot easily switch in safely as Stone Edge 2HKOes it.</p>",

Knock Off hits bulky Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gourgeist formes harder, cripples several Eviolite users, and is safe to use if you cannot predict what the opponent is about to do. Double-Edge is a good midground option, as it has a high Base Power and hits Pokemon that do not resist it extremely hard. Stone Edge should only be used over Double-Edge along with Stealth Rock, as without it, Marowak misses out on many important KOs with Stone Edge. Stealth Rock is a great entry hazard, and Marowak threatens several Defog users with Stone Edge or Double-Edge after Stealth Rock is set up. Substitute allows Marowak to take advantage of the switches it forces, and Substitute keeps it safe from faster Pokemon and gives it a buffer against moves such as Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp. Earthquake can be used for a more accurate Ground-type STAB move, but it doesn't break through Substitutes or Sturdy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rock Head is the best ability to use if Marowak is running Double-Edge, as it prevents recoil damage, but Battle Armor should be used if Stone Edge is run. Thick Club doubles Marowak's Attack. Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Marowak's offensive power. 252 Speed EVs are invested to Speed tie maximum Speed Golem, and also to allow Marowak to outspeed uninvested Pokemon that have base 65 to 70 Speed, such as Roselia and Pelipper.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is good to use in the lead position when predicting a Pokemon with Sturdy to come in, such as Golem, as Marowak can stop them from setting up Stealth Rock by threatening them with Bonemerang. Stealth Rock should be used when running Stone Edge, as it helps to achieve KOs on bulky Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Pelipper and Avalugg. However, Substitute is useful when predicting a switch, as it will allow Marowak to avoid burns and item removal. When you predict one of Marowak's checks or counters will come in, use Knock Off, which will cripple that Pokemon by removing its item and prove useful later in the game. Watch out when the foe has access to Trick, Switcheroo, or Knock Off, as removing Marowak's Thick Club will nullify its usefulness. Marowak can switch into Choice-locked Electric-types and prevent them from using Electric-type moves, most notably Volt Switch, giving Marowak a free turn, as it forces the opponent to switch. Marowak should be wary of the coverage moves that Electric-types generally carry, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sticky Web support is quite useful, as it lowers the foe's Speed, allowing Marowak to outspeed and put the hurt on a lot more Pokemon. Examples of Sticky Web users include Leavanny and Smeargle. Thunder Wave support is also quite handy, as Marowak can outspeed any paralyzed Pokemon in the tier, despite its low Speed. Fire-types, which can absorb Will-O-Wisp, especially those with Flash Fire, such as Ninetales and Rapidash, make for good partners, as Marowak is really hampered by it. Guts users such as Ursaring and Luxray can also absorb burns well. Teammates that can get rid of Grass-types which threaten Marowak are really useful too, such as Articuno. Pokemon that beat offensive Water- and Ice-types are good teammates, such as Rotom-F and offensive Tangela, as these threaten Marowak. Trick Room users, such as Carbink, allow Marowak to move first without having to risk an incoming burn from a faster Pokemon. If you're using a Trick Room team, Marowak is a great choice because of its low Speed stat, but make sure Marowak is Brave-natured with no Speed investment and 0 Speed IVs.</p>"

With one of the best defensive abilities in the game, Regenerator, Tangela can be an amazing pivot that heals itself each time it switches out. In addition to its modest Special Attack, it has a decent movepool that includes Sleep Powder and Synthesis. However, Tangela somewhat relies on its Eviolite, and losing it can be detrimental. Its weakness to common types in PU such as Fire, Ice, and Flying hinders its usefulness a bit. Overall, as either an offensively based tank or a defensively based supporter, Tangela's ability to fit into any playstyle allows it to be a great asset to any team.</p>",

Zebstrika can OHKO Tangela with Overheat, while Gogoat can set up on it and proceed to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Swanna, Chatot, and Dodrio do not take much damage from Tangela's moves outside of Ancient Power and can blow it away with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Muk and Arbok all have a relatively easy time beating Tangela, as they take little damage from Tangela's attacks and can threaten it with their super effective STAB attacks. Muk is an exceptionally good counter, as it takes pitiful damage from Hidden Power, can't lose its item thanks to Sticky Hold, and usually runs Sleep Talk.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Even thought they are quite rare, Steel-types such as Klang are some of the best answers to Tangela. Thanks to Rest + Sleep Talk Klang is able to set up on Tangela for free while keeping itself healthy and can then proceed to sweep the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers including Ice-types such as Rotom-F and Regice and strong Psychic-types like Beheyeem can all threaten Tangela with their STAB attacks but they must be careful when switching in.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is an incredibly powerful STAB move that hits Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types very hard at the cost of halving Tangela's Special Attack with each use. Sleep Powder is used to put foes to sleep, crippling them and conferring momentum. Giga Drain is Tangela's more reliable STAB attack, providing coverage against Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, as well as being a reliable source of recovery. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice allows Tangela to hit Grass- and Flying-types that resist Grass-type attacks such as Jumpluff, opposing Tangela, and Dodrio. Ancient Power can be used instead to hit Fire- and Flying-types more effectively on the switch while still being able to hit Bug-types. Hidden Power Fire can also be used to hit Steel-types such as Metang along with Grass-types. Stun Spore can be used over a coverage move to cripple switch-ins such as Grumpig and Monferno once Sleep Clause has been activated. Knock Off can also be used to cripple Pokemon such as Roselia, Bronzor, and Clefairy that can set up on Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread increases Tangela's bulk and attacking power, the latter further supplemented by a Modest nature. 4 Speed EVs are used to fix Tangela's imperfect Speed IV due to Hidden Power Fire allowing it to Speed tie with opposing Pokemon with base 60 Speed such as opposing Tangela. Eviolite is Tangela's item of choice, as it drastically increases its defenses. Lastly, Regenerator allows Tangela multiple switch-in opportunities to act as a bulky pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tangela's primary function is to act as a very bulky special attacker, taking on most Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon with ease. Tangela works well on bulky offensive teams thanks to its great raw physical bulk and Regenerator that allow it to act as a bulky pivot. Avoid special attacks if possible, as even though it is bulky, Tangela's Special Defense is far lower than its Defense. Tangela can come in on most physical attackers and wear them down with Leaf Storm or Giga Drain. Sleep Powder should be used to cripple one of Tangela's checks or counters on the switch-in, though this requires a bit of prediction.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Monferno make for excellent teammates, as they beat Bug- and Ice-types, while Tangela beats Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types for them in return. Ground-types such as Golem and Stunfisk make for good teammates, as they can beat Poison- and Fire-types for Tangela, while Tangela beats Water-types in return.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a reliable STAB attack and source of recovery that provides coverage against Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, such as Floatzel and Golem. Sleep Powder cripples foes by putting them to sleep, ensuring a gain in momentum. Synthesis can be used as a reliable source of instant recovery. Finally, Hidden Power Fire allows Tangela to hit Grass-types resists such as Leafeon and lets it effectively beat Klang. Knock Off is a viable option too to deal with opposing Eviolite users such as Bronzor and Clefairy. Stun Spore can be used for its ability to cripple foes such as Monferno for the whole match, but Tangela struggles to find the room to run it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread, along with a Bold nature, maximizes Tangela's physical bulk. 4 Speed EVs are used to fix Tangela's imperfect Speed IV due to Hidden Power Fire allowing it to Speed tie with opposing Pokemon with base 60 Speed such as opposing Tangela. Eviolite further bolsters both of Tangela's defenses to decent levels allowing it to take hits such as non STAB Ice Beam from opposing Water-types quite comfortably. Regenerator allows Tangela to regain HP every time it switches out, making it very hard to wear down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tangela's primary function is to act as a physical wall, as it can take on most Water-, Rock-, and. Ground-type Pokemon with ease. It works best on balanced teams thanks to its great bulk, array of support moves, and ability to switch in and out thanks to Regenerator. Avoid taking hits from special attacks if possible, as Tangela's Special Defense is far lower than its Defense, even when holding Eviolite. Tangela can come in on most physical attackers and wear them down with Knock Off and Giga Drain. With a bit of prediction, Sleep Powder can be used to cripple one of Tangela's checks or counters on the switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special walls such as Audino make for the best teammates, as they form great defensive cores with Tangela. Ground-types such as Golem and Stunfisk make for good teammates, as they can beat Poison- and Fire-types for Tangela, while Tangela beats Water-types in return. Mawile can be useful to check the few physical attackers Tangela has trouble with, namely Dodrio and Muk, and can also offer Stealth Rock support to the team. Lastly, Fire-types such as Monferno and Rapidash are excellent teammates, as they beat the Bug- and Ice-types that trouble Tangela, while Tangela beats Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types for them in return.</p>"

  "Seaking": {
    "overview": "<p>Seaking stands out as a notable counter to Electric-types and check to Water-types thanks to its combination of pure Water typing and Lightning Rod. It also has an interesting offensive movepool with plenty of good options backed up by decent Attack. However, it's held back by very mediocre Speed and mediocre Defense, which leave it easily checked by many strong attackers such as Stoutland. Its reliance on typing rather than bulk to beat foes means that it can easily be chipped away at, especially with its lack of reliable recovery. Seaking also faces extreme competition from Chinchou, which has much more longevity when it comes to checking Rotom-F. However, Seaking still shines as one of the best switch-ins to Rotom-F, and Electric-types in general, in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set fares better versus special attackers but leaves Seaking without any recovery, making it even easier to wear down. Haze helps check setup sweepers but is difficult to fit onto a moveset. Toxic can cripple bulky switch-ins, but Seaking generally does this well enough with Knock Off and strong coverage. A Choice Band set is fairly strong, but it again leaves Seaking without recovery, which makes it harder to counter foes throughout the game. Seaking has access to Agility to attempt a fast sweeper set, but such a set is generally outclassed by Kingler and Huntail, which are far stronger, outside of its immunity to Electric-type attacks. RestTalk or ChestoRest sets increase Seaking's longevity but force it to drop useful coverage. A set with Ice Beam and Scald has the advantage of spreading burn with Scald and can hit Tangela harder but both moves are really weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangela and Gogoat can pivot into Seaking and threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Gourgeist-XL, however, is the best counter since it takes little from any of Seaking's moves, even Knock Off, and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. However, most Grass-types do not appreciate being Knocked Off or can be hit with a super effective Megahorn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Due to Seaking's mediocre defenses, strong attackers such as Stoutland, Dodrio and Choice Specs Chatot can either KO Seaking or weaken it to the point where it is unable to switch into Electric-types.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to Seaking's lack of recovery, it can slowly be worn down by weaker attacks, entry hazards, burn, and poison until it can be easily KOed.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Many physically bulky Pokemon such as Altaria, Tangela, and Relicanth take little from Seaking's attacks and can deal far more back to it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is Seaking's most powerful attack and allows it to threaten the likes of Golem and Stunfisk. Megahorn allows Seaking to hit Grass-types such as Leafeon and Gogoat on the switch in and is its most powerful attack versus opposing Water-types. Knock Off cripples switch-ins such as Roselia, Tangela, and Vullaby by removing their Eviolite, and Facade allows Seaking to break Rotom-F's Substitute even when burned and pivot into Scald users such as Politoed more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lightning Rod grants Seaking an immunity to Electric, which is essential for countering opposing Electric-types. 72 Speed EVs allow Seaking to outspeed maximum Speed Golem and OHKO it with Waterfall, while the HP and Special Defense investment lets it take Rotom-F's Life Orb-boosted Blizzard three times factoring in Leftovers recovery and increases its general bulk. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to hit a jump point when combined with an Adamant nature and to generally hit harder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Seaking can be brought in on opposing Electric-types to fire off strong attacks, but it should otherwise be careful about switching into foes. Seaking needs to stay healthy throughout longer games to consistently prevent foes from freely using Volt Switch, which they would be able to do with Seaking out of the picture. Using Knock Off a lot, especially when given free turns by Electric-types, is a good way to wear down opposing teams and cripple them by removing items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seaking helps teammates such as Vullaby and Floatzel that value opposing Electric-types being unable to freely come in and use Volt Switch to gain momentum. Physical walls such as Tangela and Stunfisk help check strong physical attackers such as Stoutland, which can force Seaking out. Grass-type checks such as Arbok and Monferno help cover for Seaking's one weakness. Audino is useful for passing Seaking Wishes to make up for its lack of recovery; clerics like Audino and Grumpig also help heal Seaking of status.</p>"

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime stands out as both an excellent Choice Scarf revenge killer and a strong wallbreaker with Nasty Plot or Choice Specs, allowing it to perform multiple different roles for teams. Its unique STAB combination backed up by Focus Blast gives Mr. Mime perfect neutral coverage, which makes it fairly threatening coupled with its solid Special Attack. Mr. Mime also has access to a number of different utility moves, being the best user of Healing Wish, the best stallbreaker in the tier with Nasty Plot, and a solid lure for defensive Pokemon with Trick. Additionally, its dual STAB makes Mr. Mime perfect for checking Combusken and Monferno, and Soundproof allows it to counter Chatot, three very common threats. However, Mr. Mime's awful physical bulk leaves it easy to revenge kill and prone to being Pursuit trapped, and its Speed tier, while being solid, is still not high enough to outspeed strong attackers such as Dodrio. Additionally, Mr. Mime has a few common checks, including Metang and Mawile, that hinder its effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Technician Hidden Power Fighting is more accurate than Focus Blast but still quite a bit weaker and sacrifices the potential of two useful abilities. Encore on offensive sets can cause issues for opposing walls but is generally inferior to Nasty Plot. Shadow Ball can be effective on the Choice Specs set to lure in and surprise Metang and Duosion, but otherwise it isn't necessary for anything. Mr. Mime has a number of other coverage options such as Energy Ball and Thunderbolt, but they simply aren't necessary with the great neutral coverage offered by its main three moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Mr. Mime's mediocre bulk, faster revenge killers, particularly physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Dodrio, Ninjask, and Simisage, can KO it with ease. However, most of them cannot switch into Mr. Mime, and many are outsped and KOed by Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Tanks</strong>: Due to Mr. Mime's only middling power, tanks such as Dusknoir, Bouffalant, and Gogoat can survive an attack and do significant damage to or simply KO Mr. Mime.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Unboosted, Mr. Mime can be walled by special walls such as Audino, Camerupt, and Clefairy, although all have to be wary of switching into Nasty Plot or a Choice Specs-boosted Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mr. Mime's poor physical bulk leaves it KOed by strong priority users such as Dusknoir, Murkrow, or Choice Band Floatzel after little to no chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mr. Mime can be worn down by status and entry hazards, leaving it in KO range of weaker special attackers or revenge killers. Pursuit trappers such as Dusknoir and Metang can also chip away at Mr. Mime attempting to switch out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mr. Mime can opt for two different Psychic-type STAB moves; Psychic does more to Stunfisk, Relicanth, and other physically bulky foes, while Psyshock can OHKO Cryogonal and deals more damage to specially bulky foes such as Regice. Dazzling Gleam is Mr. Mime's main Fairy STAB move to hit foes such as Vullaby. Focus Blast rounds out its coverage by hitting Steel-types. Healing Wish allows Mr. Mime to give a second chance to weakened teammates, while Trick can also be used to cripple defensive switch-ins such as Audino and Clefairy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature in tandem with Choice Scarf allow Mr. Mime to outspeed everything up to and including Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Mr. Mime to revenge kill foes more effectively. Soundproof should be used if Chatot is a threat to Mr. Mime's team; otherwise, Filter is preferred to take less damage from super effective attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mr. Mime should be preserved as a revenge killer or late-game cleaner if the opposing team has a Speed-boosting sweeper like Fraxure or Crustle. Be careful when choosing which move to lock Mr. Mime into, as it often will have multiple Pokemon able to pivot into only one of its attacks early-game. Keep Mr. Mime away from strong priority users such as Basculin, Floatzel, and Murkrow, which can KO it with little or no chip damage. If necessary, preserve a weakened teammate to restore it with Healing Wish late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mr. Mime generally fits on offensive or balanced teams in need of a Choice Scarf user that doesn't need much team support to justify itself. Teammates that allow foes to set up easily such as Audino can use a revenge killing teammate. Teammates weak to Fighting such as Probopass and Bouffalant can use Mr. Mime to pivot into such foes. Checks to Steel-types such as Monferno and Stunfisk and Pokemon that can pressure or trap Dusknoir such as Pawniard and Murkrow help take on many of Mr. Mime's weaknesses. Offensive teammates like Simisear and Ninjask that wear themselves down can benefit from Healing Wish, although the partner that is healed by Healing Wish should be decided on a game-to-game basis. Pokemon such as Ninetales can help weaken Grumpig.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Mr. Mime's Special Attack to break through bulky foes. Dazzling Gleam and Psyshock are Mr. Mime's main STAB attacks to hit all non-Steel-types, which are covered by Focus Blast. Psychic can be used, although it is weaker versus Audino and Regice, two foes that Mr. Mime needs to break through.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature aim to outspeed and KO as many foes as possible once set up, while maximum Special Attack allows Mr. Mime to wallbreak more effectively. Life Orb boosts Mr. Mime's power but chips away at it quickly; alternatively, Twisted Spoon can be used to provide a power boost and bluff Choice Scarf but does not boosts all of Mr. Mime's moves, leaving it a fair amount weaker than Life Orb. Soundproof should be used if the team is weak to Chatot; otherwise, Filter is better for slightly reducing damage from super effective attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Nasty Plot versus foes incapable of doing much damage to Mr. Mime such as Vullaby and Stunfisk. If using Twisted Spoon, it can be good to bluff a Choice Scarf by going for a single attack and switching out before surprising foes expecting Mr. Mime to be unable to switch attacks. Mr. Mime is better used as an early-game wallbreaker, as it can be revenge killed fairly easily unless facing an exceptionally slow team. Similarly, don't bother setting up Nasty Plot versus offense, as Mr. Mime can be revenged fairly easily and should just focus on getting individual KOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Mr. Mime generally fits on more offensively inclined teams as a Pokemon to break apart defensive cores. Special sweepers and cleaners such as Rock Polish Regice and Choice Scarf Chatot can use Mr. Mime's wallbreaking to sweep. Physically defensive teammates such as Quilladin and Vullaby are useful to fall back on once Mr. Mime is forced out by a faster attacker. Entry hazard setters such as Golem and Roselia can help Mime reach KOs by chipping away at foes. Checks to Dusknoir such as Pawniard or Vullaby can help, as Dusknoir it can end Mr. Mime's sweep quickly thanks to priority Shadow Sneak or Pursuit trap it for significant damage.</p>"

A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed foes such as non-Choice Scarf Rotom-F, although a Modest nature can be used to augment Mr. Mime's power. Soundproof should be used if the team needs to handle Chatot more effectively; otherwise, Filter is the preferred ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mr. Mime should be brought in as frequently as possible to keep up wallbreaking pressure with strong attacks. Be careful about which move to lock Mr. Mime into, as there are many Pokemon that can pivot into one of Mr. Mime's attacks but not the other two. Mr. Mime can bluff a Choice Scarf prior to attacking, which may help to force out faster foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mr. Mime can fit on balanced or offensive teams as a very strong wallbreaker. Sweepers such as Ninjask, SubSalac Simipour, and Drifblim appreciate its wallbreaking support. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Stunfisk and Quilladin can help to wear down foes even further. Spikes setters in particular are useful, as many of Mr. Mime's best checks are grounded and it threatens most entry hazard removers. Slower pivots such as Lumineon can help to bring Mr. Mime in more freely. Partners that can check Steel-types and Metang in particular such as Ninetales and Pawniard are useful, while bulky teammates such as Vullaby can help take on physical revenge killers.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Electabuzz has one of the highest base Speed stats in the tier, allowing it to be a faster special attacker than some other Electric-types such as Rotom-F. It can also hold Eviolite, which makes it bulky enough to check Pokemon such as Dodrio and survive attacks even from strong attackers such as Simipour, which other Electric-types struggle against. Vital Spirit makes Electabuzz immune to sleep, making it a solid choice against Pokemon such as Jumpluff, but Zebstrika can fulfill this role slightly better thanks to Sap Sipper. Moreover, Electabuzz's bulk isn't great in comparison with other Eviolite users and Electabuzz cannot use a boosting item, meaning its damage output is outclassed by other Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu. Finally, Electabuzz's lack of recovery makes it susceptible to residual damage such as entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Grass could be used to hit Pokemon such as Golem and Carbink, but Hidden Power Ice comes in handy more often. Psychic can be used to hit Roselia stronger than anything else, though other coverage moves are usually more useful to hit a bigger variety of threats. Signal Beam is decent against Grass- and Psychic-types, but, similarly to Psychic, Electabuzz doesn't have room for it. Static can be used over Vital Spirit, as having the ability to paralyze physical attackers can be valuable, but Electabuzz would lose its immunity to sleep. A bulkier set can be used as well, using moves such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Light Screen, but other support Pokemon such as Meowstic-M and Solrock can fulfill that role better. A Life Orb set can be used along with Cross Chop to have a chance against specially bulky Pokemon such as Audino, but Raichu can perform a Life Orb set better. A physical set can be used to surprise special tanks that usually find themselves switching into Electabuzz, such as Roselia and Audino, as Electabuzz does have a decent physical movepool with access to moves such as Wild Charge, Ice Punch, Fire Punch, and Cross Chop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Audino, Roselia, Regice, Grumpig, and Stunfisk all take little damage from Electabuzz's moves and can either stall it out or tank a hit and retaliate with an attack or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types, such as Roseila and Tangela, can deal with Electabuzz, as they can deal good damage to it while Hidden Power Ice does little damage. Frailer Grass-types, such as Simisage and Leafeon, all carry threatening STAB moves and are able to easily KO Electabuzz.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem and Camerupt threaten Electabuzz a lot because they're immune to Volt Switch. They are able to turn the momentum to their side and OHKO Electabuzz with a STAB move, though they don't appreciate getting hit by Hidden Power Ice or Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: If Electabuzz gets hit by Knock Off, it will lose a chunk of bulk and become even easier to wear down. Examples of Knock Off users that can cripple Electabuzz are Armaldo, Audino, and Pawniard.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, along with status conditions such as burn and poison, are able to cut off a big part of Electabuzz's HP, limiting its usefulness to VoltTurn chains.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Eviolite": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt deals consistent damage and has good neutral coverage. Volt Switch is Electabuzz's secondary STAB move and helps with gaining momentum and wearing down foes. Focus Blast allows Electabuzz to hit Pokemon that are immune to or take little damage from its STAB moves, such as Audino, Golem, Probopass, and other Electric-types. Hidden Power Ice hits Grass-types, such as Roselia, Tangela, and Jumpluff, OHKOing the last.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread is used to make use of Electabuzz's high Speed and deal as much damage as possible. A Timid nature is preferred over Modest to let Electabuzz outspeed every Pokemon with less than base 105 Speed, such as Simipour, Simisear, and Simisage, and Speed tie with other common base 105 Speed Pokemon, such as Kadabra and Rapidash. Vital Spirit is used to give Electabuzz an immunity to sleep, making it a solid answer to Jumpluff. Eviolite grants Electabuzz a boost in bulk, setting it apart from the other Electric-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volt Switch is best used early on to wear down foes and catch opposing switches to open setup opportunities for teammates. Electabuzz has to be wary of Ground-types such as Camerupt and Golem, as they are immune to its STAB moves and can block VoltTurn chains; however, Electabuzz can try to hit them with Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ice on the switch, even though it's rather risky. Eviolite allows Electabuzz to become deceptively bulky, so don't be afraid to tank a hit even from a strong attacker, such as Simipour and Dodrio, and retaliate back. Electabuzz has to be wary to Knock Off users such as Armaldo, Audino, and Pawniard, as they can take its Eviolite away. Volt Switch can catch them on the switch and bring in a threat to them. Even though it is relatively bulky, Electabuzz still has to be careful to not take unnecessary damage and tank too many hits, as it's easy to wear down, so it's preferable to only switch Electabuzz in on weak attackers that it can take advantage of, such as Vullaby and Pelipper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electabuzz works well on VoltTurn teams, so partners such as Pelipper and Probopass work well. Entry hazard removal provided by Defog or Rapid Spin users such as Pelipper and Armaldo helps Electabuzz significantly, as it lacks reliable recovery. Rapid Spin user is preferred, as removing entry hazards from Electabuzz's side of the field is detrimental. Pokemon such as Pelipper and Tangela can check Ground-types and Electabuzz can deal with Electric-types and other troublesome Pokemon such as Jumpluff for them. Pokemon that are able to deal with Grass-types, such Rapidash and Dodrio, make great partners to Electabuzz as well, as Grass-types are able to tank Volt Switch and Electabuzz's coverage moves with ease. Pokemon that appreciate having Flying-types and Water-types weakened or removed make good teammates as well, such as Monferno, Ninetales, and Simisear. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia also has good synergy with VoltTurn to pressure the opponent.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lapras has excellent attacking power and coverage with just its STAB attacks, giving it a niche over other offensive Water-types like Simipour thanks to its ability to beat traditional Water-type checks such as Politoed and Roselia with Freeze-Dry. Furthermore, Water Absorb allows it to pivot into opposing Water-types such as Floatzel, making it a wallbreaker with some additional role compression options to support its team. However, Lapras's weakness to Stealth Rock and common Grass-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks makes it somewhat reliant on team support, and its mediocre Speed tier only makes it easier to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt hits opposing Lapras and Articuno, but it is a generally poor move to be locked into otherwise. Substitute + Toxic sets can beat Audino more reliably and help to ease prediction but significantly drops Lapras's power and sacrifices its more reliable attacking options in Surf and Ice Beam. Lapras can run Life Orb, Icicle Plate, or Splash Plate to boost its power without being locked into a single move, but it is left a fair amount weaker than Choice Specs sets, and Life Orb wears down Lapras quickly. Physical sets with Dragon Dance can be used but are fairly weak and outclassed by other Water-types such as Floatzel. Defensive sets also seem passable at a first glance but are fairly outclassed due to Lapras's lack of recovery. Ice Shard can be used as a filler move to get some extra chip damage on faster foes, but it isn't particularly strong and so only helps against Ice-weak foes such as Jumpluff. Whirlpool + Perish Song sets are potentially deadly for stall teams, but fairly useless unless blessed with a good matchup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Type Advantage</strong>: Due to Lapras's large number of weaknesses, it can easily be checked by many foes carrying super effective STAB attacks such as Rotom-F, Golem, Leafeon, and Monferno. However, most of these foes cannot safely switch into Lapras unless predicting it to Choice-lock itself into the incorrect attack.</p> <p><strong>Specially bulky Pokemon</strong>: Lapras can be switched into by extremely bulky Pokemon such as Audino, Clefairy, and Assault Vest Bouffalant. However, the first two can be broken through by Hydro Pump after some chip damage, and Assault Vest Bouffalant can be worn down thanks to its lack of recovery. Certain other foes such as Grumpig can check Lapras but do not have the bulk to adequately deal with it over longer games.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although most faster Pokemon cannot switch into Lapras, it can be revenge killed by strong, faster foes such as Stoutland, Choice Specs Chatot, and Simisear.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Lapras's lack of recovery leaves it easily worn down by Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. While Sticky Web is less problematic, it can still leave Lapras more easily revenge killed by normally slower foes such as Golem.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry and Ice Beam complement each other, the former hitting opposing Water-types such as Lumineon and the latter providing a stronger alternative to it. Hydro Pump is Lapras's strongest attack to put pressure on bulky foes such as Audino, while Surf is a slightly weaker but more accurate alternative to be used when the extra power is not needed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs, a Modest nature, and Choice Specs contribute to Lapras hitting as hard as possible, decimating all but the bulkiest Pokemon. 136 Speed EVs allow Lapras to outspeed fully invested Adamant Golem, while the rest is put into HP to increase its general bulk. Water Absorb helps Lapras to check opposing Water-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lapras can be brought in on many slower Pokemon such as Stunfisk, Probopass, Roselia, and Vullaby when predicting them to use a support move. Although this can be risky if they go for a super effective attack, Lapras needs to be brought in as frequently as possible to wallbreak effectively, and it has very few foes that it can safely switch into due to its mediocre two resistances. Once Lapras has been brought in safely, it should aim to use the best attack for breaking down opposing teams. Hydro Pump is good for chipping away at specially bulky foes such as Audino and Assault Vest Bouffalant, while Freeze Dry is good for hitting bulky Pokemon that resist Water. In most other situations, Ice Beam and Surf are the safest neutral coverage attacks. Although Lapras is a decent check to opposing Water-types, beware of Superpower Simipour and Focus Blast Floatzel or Politoed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electric-immune Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Camerupt can help prevent foes such as Zebstrika from using Volt Switch on Lapras to gain momentum. Fighting-type checks such as Grumpig and Clefairy help take on Monferno, and both can slow down faster foes with Thunder Wave for Lapras. Grass-type checks such as Roselia and Bouffalant are also key for covering foes such as Leafeon. Teammates to help break down specially bulky foes such as Dodrio and Stoutland can help Lapras put pressure on opposing walls. Lapras also pairs well with other Water-types such as Floatzel to put pressure on most Water-type checks such as Lumineon with Freeze-Dry. Setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Simisear and Rock Polish Regice can use Lapras's special wallbreaking capabilities to more easily sweep late-game.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ditto is a passable revenge killer with the unique niche of copying stat changes and discouraging foes from setting up. Ditto doesn't actually need to have synergy with its team thanks to the fact that it can transform into an opposing Pokemon, although, at certain times, it's not very useful and can't switch into attacks. However, Ditto struggles against defensive teams, as well as bulky setup Pokemon, such as Duosion and Clefairy. Ditto can also be predicted fairly easily, as the opponent knows its set when it copies a Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ditto doesn't really have any other options, as running a different item is almost always not as valuable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Ditto is unable to Transform into a Pokemon behind a Substitute, so it is completely useless if it's facing one.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Ditto can't take on bulky setup sweepers, such as Clefairy, Duosion, and Gogoat, so it requires teammates to take them on.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Ditto is generally crippled by most status, as burn inflicts residual damage and leaves it ineffective if it transforms into a physical attacker, poison generally weakens it very quickly, and paralysis severely cripples it by leaving it unable to outspeed the Pokemon it transforms into.</p> <p><strong>Playing Around It</strong>: Because the opponent knows Ditto's set once it transforms into one of their Pokemon, they can go to something on their team that can take it on or just play around it once it locks itself into a move.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is the only move Ditto learns, but it doesn't have to be used anyway, as Imposter activates upon switching in. Once Ditto transforms, it only has 5 PP in a certain move before it is forced to use Struggle, so that move should be chosen wisely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>30 SpA / 30 SpD IVs provide Hidden Power Ground, which can be used to take on Zebstrika and Raichu if you switch Ditto into them. However, the IVs for Hidden Power Fire, 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 0 Spe, allow Ditto to hit Pokemon such as Tangela, while Hidden Power Electric's IVs, which are 30 SpA / 1 Spe, allow Ditto to hit Floatzel and Simipour if they are using Hidden Power Electric. Ditto utilizes a Choice Scarf so that it doesn't rely on winning Speed ties. Imposter is used to automatically transform into a foe. Minimum Speed and maximum Defense help take on opposing Ditto when both are using Struggle, although that is a rare situation.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ditto should be used as a revenge killer that can switch into foes and copy their stat changes. Ditto should only be brought in by slow pivoting moves, such as Vullaby's U-turn, and shouldn't switch into any hits, although it can check Pokemon such as Politoed by using their abilities against them. If possible, remove Toxic Spikes before switching in Ditto, as they can severely weaken it over time. If the opponent has a threatening setup sweeper, attempt to preserve Ditto so it can copy the foe's boosts if needed. That being said, Ditto should transform into the most threatening Pokemon on your opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ditto fits most on offensive teams, as they can usually prevent Pokemon such as Ninetales from setting up a Substitute, while Ditto can check dangerous setup sweepers in return. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Cryogonal, Swanna, Vullaby, and Vibrava can help support Ditto by preventing it from taking residual damage on the switch in. Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Roselia, Arbok, and other Poison-types are beneficial for Ditto, as Toxic Spikes can wear it down very easily. Ditto pairs well with Pokemon that can take on bulky setup Pokemon, such as Simisear, which can take on Bulk Up users such as Gogoat, as well as Roselia and Klang, which can take on Calm Mind users such as Clefairy and Duosion. Slow pivoting moves such as Probopass's Volt Switch and Vullaby's U-turn can be used to bring in Ditto against a foe without taking damage.</p>"

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flareon's high Attack and access to a ridiculously strong STAB Flare Blitz mean that it can be a threatening wallbreaker in PU. While the rest of its offensive movepool is quite barren, Flareon has what it needs to get past most of the Pokemon that resist its powerful Flare Blitz. However, Flareon has quite a few problems. For an offensive Pokemon, Flareon is quite slow. This issue is not helped by the fact that Flareon is worn down incredibly easily between its weakness to Stealth Rock and the heavy recoil that comes with using Flare Blitz. Rapidash usually outclasses Flareon for the most part due to its higher Speed. Flareon also requires prediction to bypass Rock-types and Flash Fire users, while some Pokemon such as Pelipper can almost always switch into it without fear.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flareon can make use of its other ability, Guts, on a Toxic Orb set in order to be able to switch moves and have a powerful Facade. However, Flareon does not need to switch moves very often and such a set wears Flareon down even faster. Flareon can also run a specially defensive set with Wish and Heal Bell; however, its Stealth Rock weakness, mediocre base HP, and competition from Pokemon such as Audino reduce the effectiveness of defensive Flareon. Finally, Flareon can use a Choice Scarf in order to make up for its low Speed, though this sacrifices much of its wallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Fire</strong>: Pokemon that resist Fire are some of the only stops to Flareon. Pelipper is the best answer to Flareon because it resists both of Flareon's commonly used moves, though it must be wary of the rarer Double-Edge. Rock-types and Flash Fire users, such as Golem, Ninetales, and Rapidash, can easily switch in on Flare Blitz but cannot take Superpower. It is worth noting that nothing walls Flareon in sun, as all of the Pokemon that avoid 2HKOs from Flareon's moves under normal circumstances are 2HKOed by a sun-boosted Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Flareon's low Speed tier means that most offensive Pokemon outspeed it, and its low physical bulk means that a lot of Pokemon can KO it without much prior damage. Examples include Floatzel, Dodrio, Basculin, Purugly, Swanna, and Leafeon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Flareon's reliance on recoil moves, weakness to Stealth Rock, and common weaknesses make it very easily worn down. It usually only has enough HP to break through one or two walls before fainting, and a lot of Pokemon that cannot OHKO Flareon can easily do so if it has used Flare Blitz once.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a ridiculously powerful STAB move that lets Flareon 2HKO anything that does not resist it. Superpower hits Fraxure, Gabite, Golem, and Flash Fire users that resist or are immune to Flare Blitz hard. Quick Attack is mildly useful priority in late-game situations, particularly against offensive teams. Double-Edge can be used to 2HKO Pelipper after Stealth Rock but isn't useful for anything else. Flame Charge lets Flareon clean late-game but it isn't too useful in general, and Sleep Talk can be useful as Flareon is a good answer to most Sleep Powder users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread maximizes Flareon's power and lets it take advantage of its decent Speed tier. Choice Band gives Flareon a notable boost in power, and Flash Fire provides a useful immunity and gives Flareon more opportunities to switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using this set is relatively simple. The majority of the time Flareon should be using its powerful Flare Blitz, only using its other moves on predicted switches in the case of Superpower or revenge killing a weakened threat in the case of Quick Attack. Flareon should generally not be switching in on any decently strong attacks aside from predicted Fire-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works very well on sun and Sticky Web teams. The former give Flare Blitz enough power to 2HKO Pokemon that it could not otherwise, such as Pelipper and defensive Politoed, while the latter make Flareon much more effective against offensive teams by letting it outspeed many Pokemon. Entry hazard removal support from Swanna is useful as Flareon is weak to Stealth Rock. Similarly, Healing Wish Mr. Mime is a good partner to bring a Flareon that has been weakened by recoil back to full health, which is especially useful if its counters have since been severely weakened or eliminated. Hazards from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia let Flareon wallbreak more effectively, while physical sweepers benefit from its ability to break walls.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articuno is somewhat of a unique Pokemon in PU. While it is very bulky and quite strong, it is incredibly difficult to fit on a team due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock and mediocre at best synergy with PU's entry hazard removers. It also faces competition from the plethora of other Ice-types in PU. However, Articuno has a great offensive typing that lets it hit most of the tier hard, and an in ability Pressure that lets it run a unique SubRoost set that utilizes its bulk and power well. Its Agility set has niches over Rock Polish Regice in its access to STAB Hurricane and ability to outspeed all relevant Choice Scarf users at +2.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Articuno can use a Life Orb set with U-turn, but Articuno's difficulty of fitting on teams makes this a mediocre option for it. Similarly, it can run a 3 attacks + Roost offensive set, though SubRoost is usually better. Finally, Articuno has a few niche defensive options, such as Haze and Heal Bell.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Articuno isn't overly powerful, so most special walls beat it quite handily. Audino and Grumpig can use Articuno as an opportunity to use Heal Bell. Additionally, the former can also hit it decently hard with Double-Edge and pass Wishes to its teammates as it forces Articuno out, and the latter can paralyze it or phaze it out even when Articuno is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Probopass, Pawniard, and Metang wall the SubRoost set, though Pawniard does not like to repeatedly switch in. Probopass can also set up Stealth Rock to deter Articuno from switching in again. However, Pawniard and Probopass are OHKOed and 2HKOed respectively by Hidden Power Fighting from the Agility set.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While there is nothing intrinsic about Ice-types that lets them beat Articuno, many of them can for one reason or another. Rotom-F resist Articuno's STAB moves and can hit back hard with Thunderbolt. Regice is not 2HKOed by even a Life Orb Hurricane and can 2HKO Articuno with Thunderbolt, though repeated switch-ins wear it down. However, most of these Pokemon must be cautious of a potential Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status cripples Articuno, and wears it down very quickly, rendering it unable to Pressure stall or slows it down considerably. Common users of burn-, poison-, and paralysis-inducing moves include Misdreavus and Gourgeist, Politoed and Prinplup, and Grumpig, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute and Roost allow Articuno to take advantage of its good bulk and ability to cause switches and recover off damage. This combination works especially well with Pressure, as it lets Articuno stall out the PP of moves such as Hydro Pump and Stone Edge. Hurricane is a very powerful STAB move that gets good neutral coverage. Ice Beam is used to give Articuno a strong, reliable secondary STAB move, but Freeze-Dry can be used instead for a weaker alternative that gets super effective coverage on Water-types such as Politoed, Floatzel, and Simipour. Toxic also works decently well with Substitute and Roost alongside a bulkier spread.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature are used to take advantage of Articuno's decent Speed tier and allow it to hit decently hard. Leftovers gives Articuno much-needed passive recovery; without it, this set is hard-pressed to function effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in on Pokemon that Articuno has type advantage against, such as Tangela, Roselia (pivot around Sleep Powder from these two if needed), or Gourgeist-XL, and either set up a Substitute or attack. Which of these actions you take depending on what you predict the opponent to switch in to Articuno. Against users of Hydro Pump and Stone Edge, you can repeatedly use Substitute to stall out the effective four uses these moves have against Articuno. After they are either out of PP or have missed, you can either Roost to recover lost health or just attack them. It is usually best to scout Golem before attempting to stall it out of Stone Edges, as it occasionally carries Rock Blast. Do not be afraid to switch out of an extremely disadvantageous matchup, such as against Calm Mind Clefairy, even if Articuno has a Substitute up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock coupled with the fact that it shares at least one weakness with every relevant entry hazard remover in PU means that Articuno is quite hard to effectively fit onto a team. Despite synergy issues, an entry hazard remover such as Swanna, Armaldo, Cryogonal, Vullaby, Prinplup, or Vibrava is mandatory when using Articuno. Because of the passiveness of all of these hazard removers bar the former three, Articuno usually works best on balance teams with the likes of Misdreavus, Roselia, and Audino. Pokemon that deal with Rock-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Tangela, and Simipour all make solid teammates; Gourgeist-XL and Tangela in particular also handle Electric-types decently well. Likewise, Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Golem appreciate Articuno's ability to beat Grass-types, while beating Electric- and Ground-types for it in return.</p>"

Ice Beam is usually preferred over Freeze-Dry because Freeze-Dry is a rather weak move for a sweeper to rely on, but it is still of decent use against certain Water-types. Hidden Power Fighting is used to hit Probopass and Pawniard, which would otherwise wall Articuno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Modest is the preferred nature, as Articuno outspeeds Timid Choice Scarf Raichu and everything slower at +2 without needing a Timid nature. The given Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Stoutland. Life Orb gives Articuno much-needed power, as Articuno has a lot of trouble sweeping without it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up on Grass-types or other Pokemon Articuno forces out, such as Stunfisk, once you've worn down the opposing team sufficiently. Try not to let Articuno get worn down too much early-game, as this will often leave Articuno in KO range for priority users such as Pawniard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is recommended, but not outright, needed as this set should primarily be used on offensive teams and Articuno will usually only come in once in a game. However, Swanna, Armaldo, Cryogonal, and to a much lesser extent Vullaby, Prinplup, and Vibrava can still be used to remove entry hazards. Pokemon that can weaken special walls such as Audino, such as Simipour or Chatot, are good partners for this set.

It also faces competition as an offensive Grass-type from Leafeon and Sawsbuck, limiting Meganium to a support role. Meganium's defensive sets lack offensive presence as well, making them vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Raichu and Ninetales. Its mono-Grass typing gives it many common weaknesses in the tier, which hinders Meganium's defensive capabilities. Its abilities, Overgrow and Leaf Guard, don't help much. Overgrow is only useful for powering up Giga Drain when Meganium is already at cripplingly low health. Meganium is also highly vulnerable to Taunt.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Meganium's solid bulk, both physically and specially, combined with average HP makes it a decent, albeit hopelessly outclassed, physical, special, or mixed wall. It is also blessed with good support moves such as Aromatherapy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dual screens set can be run, as Meganium has enough bulk to set them up, but it is outclassed by Meowstic-M in doing this. Counter can be used to punish physical attackers such as Arbok, Sawsbuck, and many others, though it is dependent on the foe not dealing too much damage. Rocky Helmet can also be used to punish Pokemon using contact moves. Leech Seed is an option to provide a form of recovery and at the same time damage the foe. Energy Ball deals more damage than Giga Drain but removes one of Meganium's forms of recovery. Hidden Power Fire is also an option to hit opposing Grass-types and Bug-types, such as Tangela and Leavanny, super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Roselia</strong>: Roselia can cause Meganium some trouble, as it resists Giga Drain and is immune to Toxic. It can also deal a huge amount of damage using Sludge Bomb, and Meganium has no choice but to phaze Roselia or switch to a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Meganium can't do much to Pokemon such as Ursaring and Stoutland except to stomach the hit and phaze them.</p> <p><strong>Type Advantage</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales deal massive damage to Meganium and take minimal damage from it. The latter can also take advantage of Meganium by setting up with Nasty Plot. Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Dodrio resist Meganium's STAB moves and can retaliate with their super effective STAB attacks. The former can also set up with Swords Dance. Ice-types such as Articuno and Regice threaten Meganium, with the former also resisting Meganium's STAB move. Poison-types such as Muk and Arbok also destroy Meganium without too many problems, and can freely set up on sets lacking Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper</strong>: Pokemon with Sap Sipper such as Zebstrika, Sawsbuck, and Gogoat can switch in to Meganium's Giga Drain and retaliate with their attacks.</p>",

Synthesis provides Meganium with a reliable form of recovery. Giga Drain is another form of recovery that also deals massive damage to Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types such as Stunfisk, Floatzel, and Golem. Dragon Tail is an option to phaze setup sweepers lacking Substitute and to rack up entry hazard damage by shuffling the foes around. Toxic can also be used to put a timer on a foe and stall it out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides a passive form of recovery, meaning Meganium does not have to rely too much on Synthesis and has better longevity. Overgrow powers up Giga Drain when Meganium is weakened. Maximum Special Defense and HP investment with a Calm nature are used to maximize Meganium's ability to wall special attackers such as Simipour, Raichu, and Floatzel. Alternatively, Meganium can run a physically defensive set with a Bold nature and an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD. This is used to better take the hits of physical attackers such as Leafeon and Golem.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meganium is used to check special attackers such as Kadabra, Raichu, and Simipour. However, be wary of the latter's Ice Beam. To better check these Pokemon, it is best to keep Meganium as healthy as possible. Beware of taking too many hits because Synthesis has low PP. Meganium's main objective is to either wear down foes with Toxic or to rack up entry hazard damage with Dragon Tail when hazards are set. Meganium should also be used to cure the status ailments of its teammates. If a Pokemon sets up, it is best to use Dragon Tail to phaze it. Additionally, Meganium has to be wary when dealing with Taunt users.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Meganium fits well on bulky teams due to its ability to wall and stall, alongside its decent bulk. Entry hazard setters such as Roselia and Bronzor enjoy having Meganium shuffle the opponent's team with Dragon Tail. Rock-types such as Golem are great teammates, as they match up well against Flying-, Fire-, Ice-, Poison-, and Bug-types. In return, Meganium checks Water- and Ground-types for them. Water-types such as Floatzel and Kingler pair up well with Meganium, as they check Fire-types, and Floatzel can also check Flying-types with its coverage moves. In return, Meganium resists Electric-type moves for them, and can take on Water-types that may stop them from sweeping. They also form two-thirds of a Fire / Water / Grass core. Fire-types such as Ninetales and Heatmor complete the Fire / Water / Grass core and are good checks to Bug- and Ice-types. Meganium repays them by checking Water-, Rock- and Ground-types. Pokemon that dislike burn and paralysis such as Dodrio and Stoutland appreciate Meganium's Aromatherapy support. Physical walls such as Avalugg can back Meganium up against strong physical attackers.</p>"

It has decent coverage moves in Knock Off and Brick Break, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Probopass. In spite of all of these advantages, Furret is still extremely outclassed and shouldn't be used in a competitive nature.

Double-Edge should be Furret's main attacking move, as it is its strongest, though Furret should be wary of recoil. Furret should not be switched into strong attacks, as it is very frail and takes a lot of damage from even neutral attacks. Furret can switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon such as Misdreavus, but it should be wary of Will-O-Wisp. If the foe has a Pokemon that can take hits from Furret, such as Torkoal, it should use U-turn in order to gain momentum and switch into a Pokemon more suitable for dealing with the foe. U-turn can also be used to avoid Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types while not having to predict an opposing switch. If Furret no longer needs the Speed boost from its Choice Scarf, it can cripple bulkier Pokemon such as Audino and Gourgeist-XL with Trick.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Furret best fits on offensive teams for its ability to revenge kill faster foes and cripple bulkier foes with Trick. Furret appreciates Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Gabite, Probopass, and Roselia, which can help to rack up extra damage on its foes. Pokemon with access to Volt Switch and U-turn such as Zebstrika and Ninjask can form a VoltTurn core with Furret, which allows it to constantly keep up momentum, while slower Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn such as Probopass and Pelipper are also helpful to get Furret in safely and without it taking unnecessary damage. Pokemon such as Relicanth appreciate Knock Off support from Furret in order to beat Pokemon such as Tangela and Clefairy, respectively. Pokemon that can take on Fighting-types, such as Clefairy and Pelipper, are helpful to Furret, as that is its only weakness. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers are helpful to Furret in order to prevent it from being worn down quickly. Slower teams appreciate Furret's revenge killing capabilities in order to take on the metagame's faster Pokemon, such as Zebstrika and Jumpluff. Furret appreciates wallbreakers such as Grumpig, which can weaken foes to the point where Furret can revenge kill them.</p>"

  "Ledian": {
    "overview": "<p>Ledian is totally outclassed and cannot merit a slot on any serious team, as Meowstic and Ninjask do everything that Ledian can better defensively and offensively, respectively. It has terrible offensive stats, which nullifies its large offensive movepool, and a shallow support movepool, along with poor defenses and a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, making it absolutely worthless on any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ledian has a large offensive movepool and access to many boosting moves such as Agility and Swords Dance, but offensive sets are totally outclassed by Ninjask thanks to Ledian's awful offenses. Knock Off can be run over U-turn to cripple foes, but Ledian will spend most turns setting up dual screens and then being KOed anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: All offensive Pokemon in the metagame are capable of 2HKOing Ledian at worst, with most outright OHKOing it, making it almost impossible for Ledian to set up screens on the large number of faster Pokemon in the metagame, such as Ursaring and Simipour. Infiltrator Jumpluff and Ninjask are capable of OHKOing it while ignoring Reflect.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock guarantees that all offensive Pokemon are capable of KOing Ledian with half of its health gone, as well as making it easy for even the weakest defensive Pokemon to 2HKO it even with a Reflect or Light Screen up.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Floatzel and Misdreavus are capable of completely shutting down Ledian, forcing it to simply use U-turn for little damage, although all Taunt users aside from Grumpig are capable of easily KOing Ledian anyway.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dual screens are all Ledian can do to support its team and at least give other, better Pokemon an easier time setting up. Encore can give Ledian a free opportunity to set up dual screens without it having to take a hit with its poor defenses, and U-turn can be used to pivot into other Pokemon that can take advantage of the screen support, as well as get some small chip damage on foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Ledian to outspeed and set up dual screens on as many foes as possible before being KOed. Near-maximum HP investment helps bolster its poor bulk and lets it survive some neutral hits with a screen set up, although the investment is slightly lowered to take less damage from Stealth Rock. Light Clay extends the duration of Reflect and Light Screen, giving Ledian's teammates a longer opportunity to use them. Early Bird is the preferred ability, as it can help Ledian set up screens on Sleep Powder Roselia and Tangela; besides, Ledian's offenses are too poor to use Iron Fist or Swarm well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Ledian only in a support role. Setting up screens should be the priority over attacking with U-turn, and once Ledian has set up screens, it can be used as death fodder to get a free switch to a teammate to take advantage of the screens. Encore can be used to lock foes into status moves so Ledian can more easily set up screens. U-turn should only be used when Ledian has already successfully set up both Light Screen and Reflect to switch a teammate in to use them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Frail setup sweepers such as Simipour can use Ledian's screens and Encore support to more safely set up. Entry hazard removers such as Vibrava and Armaldo are needed to remove Stealth Rock for Ledian to stay at high enough HP to set up screens, as it can otherwise only survive the weakest of attacks. Pokemon that can check opposing Rock-, Ice-, Fire-, Flying-, or Electric-types, such as Leafeon, Grumpig, and Raichu, respectively, can be used to threaten Ledian's checks and counters, although sacrificing Ledian for the free switch in is normally more useful.</p>"

  "Chinchou": {
    "overview": "<p>Chinchou stands out due to its decent role compression, being able to wall many Electric-, Water-, and Ice-types in a single slot and take on threatening wallbreakers such as Rotom-F and Floatzel consistently throughout long matches. Chinchou also has access to slow pivoting with Volt Switch, which makes it less of a momentum drain than many other defensive Pokemon. However, its poor bulk leaves it reliant on its unique typing and ability combination to wall foes, leaving it easily threatened by Grass- and Ground-type attackers and strong wallbreakers. Chinchou also has competition from Seaking, which sports better offensive presence and coverage. Additionally, Chinchou can only function well on teams with bulkier playstyles due to its passiveness and the support needed for it to be effective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chinchou has many other useful moves, such as Heal Bell and Thunder Wave, but sacrificing Rest and Sleep Talk leaves it unable to reliably counter foes such as Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-F; additionally, losing Scald makes it far less reliable when attempting to use an attack with Sleep Talk. However, 80 EVs can be taken from Special Defense and invested in Speed instead to allow Chinchou to outspeed and OHKO offensive Golem without significantly reducing its bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Chinchou can be threatened out by Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Jumpluff, as they can KO it with their super effective STAB moves. Chinchou is also setup fodder for Jumpluff and Leafeon to set up Swords Dance or Roselia and Quilladin to lay down Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Although Ground-types have to be wary of switching into Scald, certain Ground-type Pokemon such as Golem and Gabite threaten to OHKO Chinchou with Earthquake. They can also use Chinchou switching out as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Due to Chinchou's poor bulk and reliance on its typing, most strong attackers that it does not wall, such as Stoutland, Dusknoir, and Pawniard, threaten to OHKO or 2HKO it while only fearing a potential Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Knock Off users such as Simipour, Pawniard, and Dodrio can remove Chinchou's Eviolite, significantly decreasing its bulk so that it cannot reliably switch into any foes anymore.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is used to threaten foes switching in with a possible burn, while Volt Switch can give momentum back to Chinchou's team by pivoting out of faster foes that cannot threaten it. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk allows Chinchou to attack while staying healthy over longer games.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is essential for increasing Chinchou's bulk significantly. Combined with maximum HP and Special Defense investment and a Calm nature, Chinchou can take on many threatening special attackers such as Simipour. Volt Absorb grants Chinchou an immunity to Electric-type attacks, helping it wall Electric-type foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chinchou's main role is to keep switching into foes that it walls, such as Rotom-F, Zebstrika, and Swanna. Scald can be useful for threatening switch-ins with a burn, but in most cases Chinchou prefers to simply go for its slow Volt Switch for momentum. Be careful of switching into Trick or Switcheroo from Floatzel or Rotom-F, which can permanently cripple Chinchou. Frustration variants of Floatzel can also lure in and 2HKO Chinchou. Similarly, avoid being prevented from recovering by Taunt users such as Grumpig and Encore users such as Politoed, both of which can keep Chinchou too low on HP to take on special attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou fits on bulkier teams that can provide defensive support for it. Physical walls such as Tangela and Avalugg are essential to take on wallbreakers that can KO Chinchou. Physically bulky Grass-types such as Quilladin and Gourgeist-XL can take on Ground-types such as Golem and opposing physical Grass-types such as Leafeon. Additional checks to Roselia such as Arbok are also crucial, as it can come in on Chinchou and set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Heal Bell users such as Audino can keep the pressure off of Chinchou by preventing it from relying on Sleep Talk rolls while Resting. On the flipside, Chinchou is very useful for supporting bulky teammates that are threatened by Rotom-F, such as Vullaby, Roselia, and Altaria, as well as teams that need a teammate to prevent foes from freely spamming Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Natu": {
    "overview": "<p>Natu is PU's only Magic Bounce user and can bounce back entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock, and status moves, such as Taunt. Natu's nice support movepool, which includes reliable recovery in Roost, momentum with U-turn, and Thunder Wave to slow down foes, makes it a great teammate on hazard-weak teams. However, its Psychic typing makes it vulnerable to Knock Off users such as Pawniard, as it relies on its Eviolite for bulk. Its Flying typing gives it a weakness to common Stealth Rock users, such as Golem and Probopass. Natu is also vulnerable to special attackers, such as Raichu and Zebstrika, because of its poor special bulk even with Eviolite. Natu is also unable to utilize an attacking set, due to its mediocre attacking stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alternatively, Natu could run Toxic to cripple specially defensive walls such as Grumpig and Audino. Haze prevents Natu from being complete setup fodder for setup sweepers, such as Nasty Plot Ninetales and Swords Dance Jumpluff. Tailwind + U-turn could be used to let slow wallbreakers, such as Stoutland, outspeed their foes. Hidden Power Fighting allows Natu to KO Pawniard, while Grass Knot combined with 56 Speed EVs allows Natu to outspeed and KO Golem after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu, can easily outspeed and KO Natu with Thunderbolt. Furthermore, they are immune to Thunder Wave, stopping Natu from freely spreading paralysis. They also can gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types can deal tons of damage to Natu with Stone Edge. In particular, Golem is immune to Thunder Wave and Rampardos can set up Stealth Rock against Natu thanks to Mold Breaker, which ignores Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Natu is unable to touch Dark-types such as Pawniard and Mightyena. Pawniard can threaten Natu by using Knock Off to get rid of its Eviolite, making it easier to KO; using Pursuit when predicting a switch; or by freely setting up a Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Although they have to be wary of Taunt due to Magic Bounce, Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir can hit Natu with their super effective moves. The former can set up a Nasty Plot, while the latter can Pursuit trap Natu.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Natu cannot do much to Steel-types such as Klang and Probopass. Klang has Rest to heal off paralysis from Thunder Wave and can set up Shift Gear, while Probopass has Power Gem to take care of Natu.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers, such as Simipour, Chatot, and Stoutland, can deal massive damage to Natu, but most of them hate being crippled by Thunder Wave on the switch in. If Natu predicts wrongly and switches into one of their attacks, it will likely be KOed, due to its poor bulk.</p>",

Alternatively, Night Shade deals more damage to Roselia and has a fixed damage output. U-turn lets Natu both gain momentum and switch out of an unfavorable matchup. Thunder Wave slows down foes so they are easier to KO. Roost provides reliable recovery and allows Natu to perform as a decent pivot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Bold nature maximizes Natu's physical bulk and minimizes the damage taken from Stealth Rock, giving it a better chance against Stealth Rock users, such as Golem. An Eviolite is chosen to provide Natu with extra bulk and allow it to be a successful pivot. Magic Bounce bounces back status moves, such as Taunt, and entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock. Natu could run a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD to take on Roselia better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Natu in on entry hazard leads in order to bounce back entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. Natu should focus on using Thunder Wave early-game in order to cripple foes. Use U-turn on predicted switches in order to get a favorable matchup. If Natu is worn down, use Roost to keep it healthy. Switch Natu into a predicted Taunt or into other status moves, such as Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Natu is best used on teams that have Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon but cannot afford to use a Rapid Spin or Defog user. Shedinja also appreciates Natu's ability to block Stealth Rock, as it gets to switch in. Natu forms a nice VoltTurn core with slow Pokemon such as Probopass, as Natu can prevent Stealth Rock from being set up on the battlefield, while Probopass traps Steel-types and sets up Stealth Rock in turn. Checks to Knock Off users such as Monferno and Muk can be useful teammates for preserving Natu's bulk. Dark-types, such as Pawniard, can take care of Ghost-types, while Natu can check Monferno. Revenge killers, such as Dodrio and Mr. Mime, outspeed many threats to Natu and benefit from Magic Bounce, as they are easily worn down. Ground-types, such as Stunfisk, take care of Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika and prevent the opponent from freely gaining momentum with Volt Switch. Pokemon that hate status, such as Fraxure, appreciate Magic Bounce support.</p>"

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>Ampharos faces a lot of competition from other Electric-types in PU; there are faster alternatives such as Zebstrika, Rotom-F, Raichu, and Electabuzz already possesses comparable bulk with Eviolite. However, its primary niche that sets it apart from other Electric-types is its access to Heal Bell, which lets it act as a cleric on bulky offensive teams. Additionally, discounting setup and item usage, Ampharos outshines its fellow Electric-types in terms of offensive presence given its higher Special Attack stat. In contrast, its slower Speed stat allows Ampharos to utilize its powerful, STAB-boosted Volt Switch effectively in order to bring frail teammates such as Floatzel and Kadabra in safely. Ampharos's ability Static allows it to spread paralysis, which, when combined with its usable bulk, may make cleaners reliant on contact-based moves such as Choice Scarf Leafeon and Choice Scarf Dodrio think twice before attacking it. On the downside, its slow Speed stat works against it as well, which, in addition to its lack of reliable recovery options outside of Rest and Leftovers, leaves it liable to be worn down and KOed. Even considering Ampharos's usable bulk, faster Pokemon with access to super effective coverage moves like Gabite are able to OHKO Ampharos. What's more, it has a limited movepool, which prevents it from fitting onto a wide variety of teams. Finally, despite its good Special Attack stat, it is still walled by bulky Grass-types like Roselia and Gogoat and Ground-types like Stunfisk and Camerupt, even if it runs Hidden Power Ice. Nevertheless, Ampharos is still an alright choice as a cleric for bulky offensive teams that are in need of Heal Bell support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a viable alternative that allows Ampharos to wear down opposing Ground-types for its teammates without having to rely on hitting them with Hidden Power Ice. Ampharos is able shift its EV investment from HP to Speed, which allows it to outspeed everything up to Jolly Golem with a Modest nature; however, doing so significantly detracts from its bulk and makes it more difficult to switch into resisted attacks in order to use Heal Bell. Assault Vest increases Ampharos's already sizable Special Defense but disallows the use of Heal Bell, which is the primary reason for using it over other Electric-types. An offensive set with Agility, Life Orb, and a Timid nature allows Ampharos to outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Rotom-F after a boost and strike hard with a combination of Focus Blast, Hidden Power Ice, and Thunderbolt. Discharge is a viable alternative to Thunderbolt, as it has a higher chance to spread paralysis, especially when used in tandem with Static. A combination of Rest and Sleep Talk capitalizes on Ampharos's bulk, but this does not grant it the moveslots it needs to hit both Grass- and Ground-types super effectively if Heal Bell is kept. Choice Specs boosts Ampharos's Special Attack to high levels and allows it to 2HKO Stunfisk with Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Water lets Ampharos hit Camerupt and specially defensive Golem harder while still maintaining super effective coverage against Stunfisk. Seismic Toss allows Ampharos to deal significant damage to foes with a lower base HP stat, such as Roselia. Once foes like Roselia and Stunfisk have been removed, Ampharos can use a combination of its other ability Plus and Magnetic Flux to boost its Defense and Special Defense by one level, and it is effective when used together with Toxic Spikes for stalling out the opposing team. While unorthodox, Fire Punch can be used to lure and surprise specially defensive Grass-types such as Roselia on the switch. When holding a Shuca Berry, Ampharos has the ability to lure Gabite, survive Earthquake, and OHKO it with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Specially defensive Grass-types such as Roselia and Gogoat take minimal damage, even from Hidden Power Ice, and these two are able to beat Ampharos thanks to their access to reliable recovery in Synthesis and Milk Drink, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Specially defensive Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Camerupt take negligible damage from Ampharos's Hidden Power Ice and are able to deal considerable damage to it in return with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Clefairy is able to switch into Ampharos and use this opportunity to set Stealth Rock or boost its Special Attack and Special Defense with Calm Mind. Other Pokemon with naturally high Specially Defense, such as Grumpig, can check Ampharos as well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Offensive Ground-types like Gabite and Krokorok are able to outspeed and OHKO Ampharos with Earthquake; however, they should be wary of switching into Ampharos directly due to the possibility it might be carrying Hidden Power Ice.</p>",

Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types like Vibrava and Gabite, which prevents them from switching into Ampharos for free. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used for a stronger Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Ampharos out, and it scores notable OHKOs on Pokemon such as Lumineon and Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage. Focus Blast grants Ampharos the ability to deal super effective damage to Pokemon that take neutral damage from or resist its pseudo-BoltBeam coverage, such as Audino, Probopass, and Rotom-F.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack with a Modest nature lets Ampharos hit as hard as possible, and 248 HP EVs allow it to survive powerful attacks from various wallbreakers such as Choice Band Stoutland's Frustration.

It should use its slow, STAB-boosted Volt Switch in order to gain momentum and bring frail teammates in safely. Ampharos should avoid staying in when threatened by Ground-type moves such as Golem's Earthquake and Camerupt's Earth Power. If your opponent's team carries Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ampharos's Electric-type STAB moves, then it should avoid using Volt Switch and instead use Hidden Power Ice against Ground-types like Vibrava or Focus Blast against targets that resist its pseudo-BoltBeam coverage like Rotom-F on a predicted switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slower physical attackers such as Stoutland and Marowak enjoy the paralysis support provided by Ampharos's Static, as well as Ampharos's Heal Bell support ridding them of crippling status effects. Ampharos pairs well with Pokemon that can switch into and remove opposing Ground-types, such as Quilladin, Tangela, and Leafeon. Frail teammates like Kadabra, Floatzel, and Simipour appreciate being brought in for free by Ampharos's slow Volt Switch.

Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Dodrio can KO opposing Grass-types that resist Ampharos's STAB moves. Dodrio and Jumpluff also benefit from Ampharos's Heal Bell. With Sticky Web support from Leavanny, Ampharos can strike grounded targets like Politoed super effectively before being hit and serve as a switch-in to Flying-type attacks for Leavanny in return.</p>"

It can attempt to be played as some sort of sun sweeper but is worse than Weepinbell in this regard. Its poor coverage and barely average Special Attack make it difficult for Bellossom to sweep, and, even under sun, Bellossom is still slower than common Choice Scarf users such as Sawsbuck, making it easy to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball can be used over Solar Beam for a STAB attack usable outside of sun, but the drop in power is noticeable enough to not be recommended. Synthesis can be run to heal Bellossom, as it can get worn down quickly by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, but it typically does not have the time or the bulk to heal itself. A Timid nature can be used to outrun Adamant Ninjask under sun; however, it still fails to outspeed other relevant targets and comes with a significant loss of power. Bellossom can attempt physical sets with its only slightly lower Attack, but it has a shallow physical movepool, is weak without setup, and lacks the free turn to set up a Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, Simisear, and Ninetales can give Bellossom trouble, as they resist all of Bellossom's moves bar Hidden Power Rock, which fails to OHKO, and can OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Thanks to Bellossom's only average power, specially bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Swalot, Regice, and Roselia can counter Bellossom fairly easily, although only Roselia is immune to Sleep Powder. Bulky sleep-immune Pokemon such as Sap Sipper Bouffalant are also notable for avoiding Bellossom's main method of getting past bulkier Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from entry hazards, Life Orb, and potentially status can quickly wear down Bellossom, leaving it vulnerable to priority attacks or simply KOing itself with recoil.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon capable of outspeeding Bellossom even under sun are often able of KOing it with little to no prior damage.

Moonblast hits Dragon-types such as Fraxure super effectively, although it barely outdamages even a resisted Solar Beam unless it's super effective. Sleep Powder allows Bellossom to put bulkier foes capable of surviving an attack to sleep for an easier 2HKO.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature and a Life Orb allow Bellossom to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment helps it outspeed nearly every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame when sun is set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bellossom can be used as either a wallbreaker or a late-game cleaner in tandem with other sun sweepers. Sleep Powder should be used on foes capable of surviving a hit from Bellossom, as well as to cripple foes capable of walling Bellossom's teammates. Solar Beam should be the go-to move, as even neutrally it hits as hard as a super effective Hidden Power Fire under the sun and a super effective Moonblast, making it Bellossom's easiest move to spam. Keep in mind that, despite Chlorophyll doubling its Speed, Bellossom will still be slower than all common Choice Scarf users and Ninjask.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bellossom should only be used on sun-based teams. Sunny Day users such as Onix and Volbeat are essential for setting sun for Bellossom and its teammates, and other sun abusers such as Sawsbuck and Weepinbell are good Pokemon to use alongside Bellossom to overload their checks and counters. Fire-types such as Rapidash not only see use on sun teams thanks to the sun boosting their STAB attacks but can also help check opposing Fire-types that threaten Bellossom, such as Ninetales, as well as Steel-types that wall it, such as Metang. Rock-types such as Probopass are useful for checking Ninjask, which can outspeed and OHKO Bellossom even under sun; however, Ninjask is still capable of U-turning out as Bellossom switches either way.

  "Sudowoodo": {
    "overview": "<p>Sudowoodo is directly outclassed by Golem due to its lack of a Ground STAB type and its lower Speed, as well as by Probopass, which can gain momentum with Volt Switch but lacks priority on Stealth Rock. Wood Hammer provides an extremely small niche over Golem that allows Sudowoodo to hit Ground- and Water-types super effectively. Sudowoodo has very low Special Defense and Speed, which leaves it vulnerable to special attackers such as Floatzel and Simipour. However, Sturdy paired with Sudowoodo's large Defense almost guarantees Stealth Rock will be set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sudowoodo has access to Taunt; however, it's too slow to put it to good use. Earthquake is another option for Sudowoodo, to take on opposing Rock- and Steel-types, but it doesn't have the moveslot for it. Low Kick or Hammer Arm can be used to hit Probopass, but it faces the same problem as Earthquake. With Sturdy, Sudowoodo can use Counter to surprise physical attackers; however, most of the time it isn't worth a moveslot. Sudowoodo could take the role of a sun setter, although it's outclassed by Golem, which can do the same role better. Leftovers can be used for a bit of recovery per turn, although Custap Berry fits Sudowoodo's role as a lead Pokemon better. Sudowoodo can also use Explosion paired with Sturdy and a Custap Berry, but it doesn't have a moveslot for it. Lastly, Sudowoodo can use a physically defensive set to better take on Dodrio and other physical attackers, although it can take them on well enough as is.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Quilladin can take any attack Sudowoodo wants to use against them and can strike back with a Grass-type attack; they have to look out for a Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Floatzel, Basculin, Simipour, and other Water-types can outpace and hit Sudowoodo with their Water-type STAB moves, although they have to watch out for a Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem and Stunfisk can hit Sudowoodo for super effective damage, but a Wood Hammer can do a lot of damage against them.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Beheeyem can take advantage of Sudowoodo's low Special Defense with their overwhelming offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Sudowoodo's lack of recovery outside of Leftovers, residual damage from entry hazards and status can rack up quickly and make it easier to take out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock can wear down opposing Pokemon by getting residual damage against them as they switch in, as well as break Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Stone Edge is Sudowoodo's strongest move and gains a STAB boost, but it has shaky accuracy. Wood Hammer allows Sudowoodo to take on Ground-, Water-, and opposing Rock-types, such as Stunfisk, Seaking, and Golem, and is a small niche over other Stealth Rock users. Sucker Punch is a solid priority move that can help pick off weakened foes. Toxic can be used over Sucker Punch to lure in and cripple walls such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature maximize Sudowoodo's power and speed. Sturdy allows Sudowoodo to survive any one hit, making sure that Stealth Rock will be set up. Sturdy also pairs well with Custap Berry, which will activate when Sudowoodo gets taken down to low health, allowing it to move before opposing Pokemon for a turn and hit faster entry hazard removers such as Swanna before they can remove Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up Stealth Rock is Sudowoodo's main priority, but it can still attack a foe if it has the opportunity. Alternatively, Sudowoodo can focus on spreading Toxic to weaken opposing walls. Due to Sudowoodo's natural physical bulk, it can be brought into physical attackers such as Dodrio and Mightyena. Sudowoodo should be utilized early-game to set up Stealth Rock so it can weaken foes and break Focus Sash and Sturdy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sudowoodo fits on offensive teams, as it can take the role of a lead with Stealth Rock. Pokemon that can switch into Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types, such as Gourgeist-XL, Roselia, and Tangela, synergize well with Sudowoodo. Roselia can also set up entry hazards of its own, forming a hazard-stacking core with Sudowoodo. Sweepers that appreciate entry hazards, such as Articuno, Ninetales, and Fraxure, are solid partners for Sudowoodo, as are cleaners such as Floatzel and Mightyena.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed is the best blanket Water check in the tier thanks to its much-coveted Water immunity. It has decent offensive pressure, and it can be difficult to play around Politoed's combination of Scald and Encore. However, it has somewhat lacking Speed and physical bulk, making it easy to pressure with common wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Dodrio. Furthermore, Politoed's lack of reliable recovery and susceptibility to being baited into strong coverage attacks such as Choice Band Floatzel's Return give it difficulties.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Choice Scarf set makes Politoed faster and less passive while still checking Water-types, although it sacrifices all of Politoed's bulk. Hypnosis can cripple switch-ins but has poor accuracy. A faster spread with 56 Speed EVs can be used to let Politoed outrun Golem and Marowak, but it is only recommended on teams that are extremely vulnerable to them, as it otherwise sacrifices bulk unnecessarily. Hydro Pump does more damage than Scald, but it comes with accuracy issues and cannot burn foes. Focus Blast can be worth a moveslot to hit Normal-types such as Stoutland and Bouffalant, but it generally isn't needed over Scald. Running Toxic or Choice Specs can cripple opposing defensive Pokemon attempting to switch in, but both generally lack the utility to deserve the move or item slot. A fully physically or specially defensive spread can be run to better outlast foes, but both leave Politoed reliant on Scald burns for dealing any serious damage. Politoed can also attempt a Perish trapping set with Whirlpool and Perish Song, but it is generally a poor strategy and cannot reliably beat Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Politoed can survive a single hit from most of the offensive Grass-types in the tier, such as Jumpluff and Sawsbuck, and KO them with Ice Beam, but it can be KOed when slightly weakened. Ice Beam does little to Roselia, which can set up entry hazards or simply KO Politoed with Giga Drain, and other defensive Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL can survive an Ice Beam and threaten Politoed with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Although they are incapable of switching in safely, offensive Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Rotom-F threaten to KO Politoed with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Politoed's mediocre bulk leaves it susceptible to being OHKOed by strong physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Leafeon and Dodrio. Strong special attackers that lack a super effective move against Politoed, such as Choice Specs Mr. Mime and Chatot, are still capable of 2HKOing it if it has taken damage from Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Politoed's lack of reliable recovery leaves it susceptible to being worn down by multiple weaker hits, entry hazards, poison, and burn. Many of the stronger attackers in the tier, such as Ursaring, only require small amounts of chip damage to secure a KO against Politoed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Politoed's strongest attack and threatens burns. Ice Beam gives Politoed coverage against Flying- and Grass-types, such as Altaria and Simisage, while Hidden Power Electric hits opposing Water-types, such as Floatzel and Simipour. Encore allows Politoed to pressure bulkier foes reliant on status moves, such as Audino. Protect can be run instead for extra Leftovers recovery and the ability to occasionally scout foes with Choice items, but it leaves Politoed much more useless versus passive teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Water Absorb allows Politoed to wall opposing Water-types, and Leftovers provides its only form of recovery outside of switching Politoed into Water-type attacks. Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature give Politoed some offensive presence and help it KO opposing Water-types more quickly, while near-maximum HP investment makes it as bulky as possible without taking increased damage from entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Politoed should be conserved until the opposing team has no Water-types left, as sacrificing it too early can leave teams vulnerable to them. Politoed is a fairly obvious switch-in to most Water-types, so be wary of opponents predicting it to come in and either hitting it with a strong coverage move or double switching to a counter. Don't use Encore too liberally, as it can quickly become predictable and give foes free turns to switch. Similarly, using Protect too often for extra recovery can give foes free switching or setup opportunities. Use Scald as much as possible to spread burns throughout opposing teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is easy to fit into most playstyles, as many Pokemon in the tier benefit from its almost unique ability to deter Water-type attackers. Pokemon vulnerable to Water-types benefit the most from Politoed's ability to absorb their STAB moves. These include Fire-types such as Monferno, Rock-types such as Golem, and even offensive Pokemon, such as Dodrio, that are normally easily revenge killed by Floatzel or Simipour. Entry hazard removal is highly appreciated, as Politoed can be quickly worn down by Spikes or Toxic Spikes, making it more difficult for it to check Water-types, and is easy Spikes fodder for Roselia, especially if running Protect. Fellow defensive Pokemon can form defensive cores with Politoed. Vullaby can take on strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and appreciates the check to Water-types that have Ice-type coverage, and Stunfisk can support Politoed with its Electric immunity in return for the Water-type check. Other Electric-type checks such as Assault Vest Bouffalant and Lightning Rod Zebstrika can deter opposing Electric-types.</p>"

  "Jumpluff": {
    "overview": "<p>While Jumpluff's very low base Attack doesn't scream \"good offensive Pokemon\", it is a fantastic Pokemon in the PU metagame for a variety of reasons. First, its great Speed and amazing movepool, which features options such as Sleep Powder, U-turn, and Swords Dance, make it a very versatile Pokemon that can provide tons of utility to nearly every team. Jumpluff can perform several important roles quite effectively. In addition to being a solid utility Pokemon in general, Jumpluff also makes for a great partner to the many threatening setup sweepers in PU thanks to its access to Sleep Powder and Memento, and it can even sweep itself with Swords Dance. However, Jumpluff's low base Attack, while somewhat mitigated by its high-Base Power STAB moves and decent coverage, makes it quite easy to switch into, especially after it has already put a foe to sleep. The Swords Dance set is easily checked by common Pokemon such as Floatzel, Zebstrika, and most Choice Scarf users. Jumpluff is also worn down quite quickly due to its Stealth Rock weakness, which can be difficult to account for in PU due to the metagame's limited number of options for entry hazard removal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jumpluff lacks viable other options outside of what has already been mentioned. Synthesis can be used, but Jumpluff lacks the space for it. Leech Seed may seem appealing as it can greatly annoy Steel-type switch-ins, but Jumpluff would much rather use its standard options. Natural Gift with a Salac Berry can be used on a Swords Dance set for a surprise 100-Base Power Fighting-type attack against Probopass and Pawniard but it gives up the immediate power of Acrobatics before use and forces Jumpluff to sacrifice one of its other important moves to work. Chlorophyll can be used to counterteam rare Sun teams, but is useless otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Zebstrika</strong>: Thanks to Sap Sipper, Zebstrika can switch into anything Jumpluff uses easily and retaliate with Hidden Power Ice, though it is worn down by entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and damage from Acrobatics or U-turn, so it cannot switch in very many times. Additionally, it is easy setup fodder for many Pokemon if it switches into Memento.</p> <p><strong>Sleep-immune Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Tangela and Gourgeist-XL can take hits from the support set quite easily, though they take quite a bit from a +2 Acrobatics. While not very common, Pokemon such as Vullaby and Electabuzz are immune to sleep and take little from Jumpluff's moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pawniard and Metang take little from anything Jumpluff throws at them, and they have Defiant and Clear Body to block Memento. They can both be threatened by Encore if they use Swords Dance or Stealth Rock, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Floatzel, Zebstrika, Purugly, and Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Simipour can make quick work of Jumpluff due to its average bulk and 4x weakness to Ice-type moves.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is a necessary STAB attack on any Jumpluff set, having decent power without an item and great coverage against a lot of Pokemon in the tier. Sleep Powder is a must as well, as it is especially good on Jumpluff to incapacitate bulkier Pokemon, since most sleep absorbers don't want to switch into Acrobatics. Seed Bomb is an important secondary STAB move that lets Jumpluff check Pokemon such as Simipour and Golem. However, Toxic can be used to wear down switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL and Stunfisk, which are greats checks to it.  U-turn lets Jumpluff pivot out of obvious switch-ins such as Zebstrika, Probopass, and Klang and is especially useful after using Sleep Powder to gain momentum. Memento lets Jumpluff give a teammate a free setup opportunity on just about anything, which is invaluable support. Seed Bomb or Encore can be used alongside Memento; the choice depends on the kind of support Jumpluff's team needs the most.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs with a Jolly nature let Jumpluff take advantage of its great Speed and hit harder than wet cardboard. However, if using Memento, Jumpluff can use HP EVs instead of Attack EVs in order to be able to switch into some attacks. No item is used in order to make Acrobatics powerful. Infiltrator allows Jumpluff to revenge kill Substitute users such as Ninetales and Sawsbuck.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>How Jumpluff should be played depends greatly on whether or not it is running Memento. If Jumpluff is not running Memento, it should be played as an offensive pivot, switching in on predicted support moves such as Taunt and Spikes and gaining momentum or putting a foe to sleep. If Jumpluff is running Memento, its main focus should obviously be finding the best time to use the move. It is best to figure out the Pokemon on the opposing team that your setup sweepers could set up on, try to draw them in, and then get Jumpluff in and use Memento. In general, it is a good idea to U-turn out of obvious switches to Jumpluff's counters.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can beat Jumpluff's common switch-ins make for good teammates. Monferno can take on Probopass and Pawniard, Stunfisk can beat Zebstrika, and Cryogonal can beat Stunfisk and help with Rotom-F. If Jumpluff is using Memento, setup sweepers such as Rock Polish Relicanth, Gorebyss, and Huntail are mandatory teammates. Fraxure in particular is a great partner, as it can easily set up on -2 Zebstrika. Defog support from Pokemon such as Swanna, Vullaby, and Vibrava is helpful, as Jumpluff is weak to Stealth Rock and likes to switch in many times throughout the match.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance lets Jumpluff function as a threatening sweeper. Sleep Powder lets Jumpluff generally be useful early in the game and set up on Pokemon that it otherwise wouldn't be able to. Acrobatics and Seed Bomb are mandatory STAB moves that have good coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs and nature are standard for a fast physical sweeper. No item is used because an item would weaken Jumpluff's main STAB option. Chlorophyll should be used if your team has trouble against sun teams, while Infiltrator should be used otherwise in order to ignore Substitutes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Jumpluff should mainly be using Sleep Powder in order to support its team (provided that the opponent has no way to block it). Once its counters have been weakened or removed, it should attempt to set up Swords Dance on something it forces out, such as Gogoat. If the opposing team is weak to Jumpluff, try to not let it take unnecessary damage early on so that it can sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dodrio and Stoutland can help soften the opposing team for Jumpluff to sweep later on. Probopass can trap Klang for Jumpluff and give it opportunities to switch in with Volt Switch. Pokemon that can switch into Jumpluff's checks and counters are recommended. Camerupt can beat both Zebstrika and Choice Scarf Rotom-F, while Politoed can beat Floatzel, and Choice Scarf Simipour.</p>"

  "Sunflora": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite Sunflora's solid Special Attack stat paired with a unique movepool featuring moves such as Earth Power and Encore, as well as the ability to function as a wallbreaker under sun due to Solar Power, it is still outclassed. Sunflora also has decent special bulk, but its mediocre defensive typing and poor Defense stat leave it vulnerable to physical attackers. Due to its underwhelming Speed, Sunflora is often outclassed by the likes of Tangela and Simisage, and it can be taken out by faster attackers more easily. Even with Chlorophyll, Sunflora fails to reach 350 Speed under sun, making it slower than common Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Raichu and leaving it outclassed by the likes of Weepinbell and Leafeon. Sunflora could operate on Trick Room teams, although it isn't a relevant playstyle in the metagame and is hard to pull off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sunflora could run Energy Ball in place of Leaf Storm or Giga Drain, but it has less power than the former, and it doesn't restore Sunflora's health like the latter. Encore can be used to lock a foe into a weak attack or setup move, although Sunflora is usually too slow to use it with any success. Grass Whistle can be used to put an unsuspecting foe to sleep. However, the exceedingly low accuracy of the move makes it hard to rely on. Chlorophyll can be run over Solar Power, although Sunflora is still too slow to utilize the Speed boost under sun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Jumpluff, Dodrio, Swanna, and other Flying-types can threaten Sunflora with their Flying-type moves, although they have to watch out for Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, Ninetales, and Simisear can OHKO Sunflora with their Fire-type STAB moves, although they have to be wary of Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Ursaring, Stoutland, Rapidash, and Dodrio can outpace Sunflora and deal massive damage to it with their STAB moves, although they can't switch into Sunflora well.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Audino, Roselia, and Bronzor can take almost any hit Sunflora wants to throw at them and fire back with chip damage or status.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Even with access to Synthesis, Sunflora often finds itself worn down by a combination of Life Orb, entry hazards, and status, which can leave it vulnerable to faster Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Synthesis + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Sunflora's strongest STAB move, but it lowers Sunflora's Special Attack after being used, leaving it susceptible to becoming setup fodder. Giga Drain is an option over Leaf Storm, as it lets Sunflora regain a bit of health, is fully accurate, and doesn't drop Sunflora's Special Attack, although it loses out on a lot of power. Earth Power allows Sunflora to take on Fire- and Steel-types a bit better, such as Rapidash and Probopass. Hidden Power Ice allows Sunflora to take on opposing Grass-types, as well as Flying-types. Hidden Power Fire allows Sunflora to hit Ice- and Grass-types for super effective damage. Sludge Bomb can be used to deal more damage to Grass-types such as Tangela, as well as Fairy-types such as Mr. Mime. Synthesis is used to restore Sunflora's HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Sunflora to outpace the likes of Audino, Prinplup, and unboosted Klang, while maximum Special Attack EVs paired with a Modest nature allow Sunflora to hit as hard as it can. Sunflora's HP investment grants it a little more bulk. Life Orb allows Sunflora to deal more damage with each attack, albeit while losing a bit of its health. Solar Power is only useful under sun, allowing Sunflora to hit even harder, although it wears it down fairly quickly in combination with Life Orb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, Sunflora should use Leaf Storm if it wants to severely damage a foe, although it has to be wary of being made setup fodder after the Special Attack drop. When possible, use Synthesis to recover Sunflora's health, as Sunflora can easily be weakened by a combination of Life Orb damage, residual damage, and opposing attackers. Sunflora should be brought onto the field by a slow pivoting move such as Probopass's Volt Switch or Pelipper's U-turn. If you predict a Fire-type to switch into Sunflora's Grass-type STAB attack, Earth Power can be a good option to take the incoming foe on, although if you predict wrong, Sunflora can be taken out or severely weakened. On the same note, if you predict a Grass-type to switch into Earth Power or Leaf Storm, Hidden Power Ice or Sludge Bomb can be a good option to take them on, although this comes with the same risk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volbeat, Golem, and other sun setters can use Sunny Day, activating Sunflora's Solar Power and making it a more effective wallbreaker. Sawsbuck, Leafeon, Weepinbell, and other Chlorophyll users pair well with Sunflora in weakening an opposing team while sun is up. Entry hazard setters such as Roselia, Crustle, and Clefairy can break foes' Sturdy and Focus Sash with their entry hazards and can weaken incoming foes in general. Pokemon such as Regice, Sawsbuck, and Ninjask appreciate Sunflora's wallbreaking under sun to clean late-game. Rock-type Pokemon such as Golem and Probopass can take on Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-type Pokemon, which can deal severe damage to Sunflora. Electric-type Pokemon, such as Raichu, Rotom-F, and Zebstrika, can take on Flying-types for Sunflora and offer momentum to it by using Volt Switch. Zebstrika is an especially good partner, as it counters Jumpluff by virtue of Sap Sipper. Entry hazard removal from Vibrava, Pelipper, Vullaby, and Armaldo can keep pressure away from Sunflora. Grumpig also has the ability to take on Fire- and Ice-types by virtue of Thick Fat.</p>"

  "Murkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Murkow's Dark / Flying typing lets it hit most of the metagame relatively hard with its STAB moves plus a coverage move. Murkrow can also function as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner with Sucker Punch. On top of this, Murkrow gets access to Prankster, a rare but useful ability in PU, allowing it to paralyze many of the faster Pokemon in the metagame and stop a variety of utility moves with Taunt. However, a look at Murkrow's defensive stats reveals a big downside; its poor bulk doesn't go well with its weaknesses to common attacking types in Electric, Rock, Ice, and to a lesser extent Fairy. Common Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Zebstrika can take advantage of this. Although it has good offensive stats, they are not amazing, forcing Murkrow to run Life Orb to give it the boost it needs to get some KOs. Another downside is that Murkrow is weak to Stealth Rock, and when this is combined with Life Orb recoil, Murkrow can be revenge killed quite easily. Murkrow faces competition from Dodrio, which is more potent in typing and stats, but Murkrow has Prankster as well as a much more powerful priority move, and Dodrio lacks the Special Attack that Murkrow has.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Any non-offensive set should be coupled with Eviolite, giving Murkrow's pitiful defensive stats a meaningful boost. Calm Mind has many checks but still sees some light in the metagame. Another set option is a Prankster set, making full use of the ability, but Murkrow is lacking a bit in bulk, is weak to Stealth Rock, and relies on constant recovery and luck. Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Mawile, Probopass, and Pawniard all at once, but crucially fails to OHKO Mawile and Pawniard making it a poor substitute for Heat Wave. Perish trapping is more effective on Murkrow than other Pokemon due to Prankster, but it generally only works on less experienced or less cautious opponents. Another option is Torment, which is tricky to use but can mess up your opponent's plans and force out users of Choice items. Finally, Murkrow can provide support by setting up a priority Rain Dance or Sunny Day, which is important on weather teams. However, Volbeat also does this well and possibly better, as it provides Encore support, access to U-turn, and the ability to hold the respective weather rocks, which Murkrow lacks the ability to do.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock takes a big chunk of Murkrow's health off every time it switches in, and when it is combined with an attack from the foe, Murkrow won't be hard to knock out. Furthermore, Life Orb already puts Murkrow on a timer and gives it a set number of attacks that it can use. Similarly, status effects greatly hinder its offensive presence, and because Murkrow doesn't usually run Roost, any residual damage can be devastating.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Some Pokemon can easily take Murkrow's hits and KO it. Furthermore, a variety of Pokemon can capitalize on Murkrow's coverage depending on which Hidden Power it has. Not having Hidden Power Grass will let the likes of Golem avoid KOs, and not having Heat Wave will let Mawile wall Murkrow.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Murkrow's impressive Speed stat, some Pokemon are faster or carry Choice Scarf and are powerful enough to KO Murkrow, such as Leafeon and Simipour. However, these Pokemon don't appreciate getting paralyzed, and if Murkrow can get them to below half health, Sucker Punch can pick them off.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types are immune to Thunder Wave and are usually very fast. Murkrow's only means of doing damage to them is with Sucker Punch, and most Electric-types can take this and KO back or predict this and set up. For example, Raichu can get a Nasty Plot off, but predicting this and trying to go for Taunt can just as easily get Murkrow KOed on the overprediction. Rotom-F is another excellent check to Murkrow, as failing to guess its set correctly could lead to a free Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Even with Hidden Power Grass, Golem and Crustle are still capable of taking a hit from Murkrow, especially with Sturdy still intact, and KOing Murkrow with Stone Edge.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Murkrow's hardest hitting STAB move and packs quite the punch, but you should use it carefully, as the heavy recoil is nasty. Sucker Punch is a powerful STAB priority move, bypassing Murkrow's mediocre Speed and letting it pick off weakened foes. Heat Wave allows Murkrow to break through Mawile and Pawniard, although Hidden Power Grass can be an option to lure Golem. Lastly, Pursuit lets Murkrow trap Pokemon it forces out such as Grumpig and Roselia while Thunder Wave can be used slow down offensive threats in an emergency.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe maximizes the power of Murkrow's attacks, and enhances its Speed, allowing it to outspeed a few threats such as Mr. Mime, while a Naive nature further boosts Murkrow's Speed without hindering its Special Attack or Attack. Note that Murkrow can switch into Stealth Rock four times with this set. Life Orb allows Murkrow to get some crucial KOs, such as a guaranteed OHKO on Roselia with Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage. Prankster should be used with Thunder Wave, in order to gain priority to stop set up sweepers, otherwise if Murkrow is not running a status move, Super Luck is preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Murkrow is a wallbreaker; it has coverage to hit common walls very hard and can outspeed a few offensive threats such as Monferno and Arbok. However, if you bring it in on a foe that it doesn't scare out or KO, it can get knocked out very easily. As Murkrow really lacks the bulk to switch in, it's best either to bring it in freely after a teammate is KOed or to Volt Switch or U-turn into it. Great options to fill this role are Probopass and Pelipper, although Pelipper shares many of Murkrow's weaknesses. Weaken the opposing team with entry hazards and constant pressure, and clean up afterwards with Sucker Punch. If Thunder Wave is chosen, note that you can sacrifice Murkrow if it means stopping a sweep with Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As you want to give Murkrow the most uses of its Life Orb, a Defog or Rapid Spin user is a good idea. Lumineon and  Vibrava are good options, providing support while taking on some of Murkrow's weaknesses. Stunfisk and Probopass are useful teammates, as they check Electric- and Ice-types, respectively, and are able to set up Stealth Rock. Another good entry hazard setter is Roselia, which can set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes and absorb status with Natural Cure. Despite these bulkier Pokemon being suggested, a team leaning towards offense will keep up pressure and force switches with your entry hazards up, as well as give you more options for teammates. Last but not least, Volt Switch and U-turn users are important to get momentum and a free switch. Probopass and Pelipper can provide a slow Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively, and other Pokemon such as Zebstrika or Ninjask can also fill the role of a Volt Switch or U-turn user, despite not being slow.</p>"

  "Misdreavus": {
    "overview": "<p>A rather versatile Pokemon with viable offensive and defensive sets, Misdreavus has many qualities that make it a threat in PU. With its unique typing and good bulk with Eviolite, Misdreavus can check a variety of common threats, including Bouffalant, Monferno, and Arbok. Its access to a fast Taunt and Will-O-Wisp in addition to Nasty Plot gives it great potential to break apart balanced cores, and its additional utility in moves such as Thunder Wave and Perish Song makes it still more versatile. Misdreavus's useful immunities to Spikes and Toxic Spikes allow it to stay healthy without too much difficulty, and its typing also discourages the use of Rapid Spin. However, Misdreavus suffers from having a low damage output with a mediocre Special Attack and rather weak moves in its arsenal, although it does boast excellent coverage with moves such as Dazzling Gleam and Thunderbolt. Moreover, its inability to hold Leftovers combined with its only form of recovery being Pain Split makes it susceptible to being worn down throughout a match, and its weakness to Knock Off makes it difficult for Misdreavus to check threats like Dodrio.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Perish Song allows Misdreavus to beat bulky sweepers such as Clefairy and Duosion and can also be used to force switches on sweepers that Misdreavus can't handle by itself, but Taunt generally gets the job done. Heal Bell lets Midreavus act as a cleric for its team. Destiny Bond is a niche option that can remove a foe reliably in combination with Taunt. Substitute can be used to avoid crippling status and make it more difficult for burned targets to weaken Misdreavus, but Misdreavus's lack of recovery hurts it. A Calm Mind set is an option, though Misdreavus's weakness to status and powerful wallbreakers renders this set ineffective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Loss of Eviolite will greatly reduce Misdreavus's ability to perform its role, and Knock Off from strong attackers such as Simisage, Simipour, and Armaldo can 2HKO Misdreavus. Pawniard greatly threatens even defensive variants of Misdreavus with its powerful STAB Knock Off, but must be wary of switching into Hidden Power Fighting from offensive variants.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types can switch into Will-O-Wisp with impunity, and, in the case of Rapidash and Ninetales, can even activate Flash Fire. They also don't take much damage from Misdreavus's relatively weak Shadow Balls.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful attacks from the likes of Simipour and Rotom-F can weaken Misdreavus easily, especially as Pain Split is an unreliable form of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and burn both make it easy for Misdreavus to get worn down and render it unable to check the Pokemon it should. Paralysis can also prevent Misdreavus from burning, attacking, or using Taunt on foes it normally outspeeds.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Guts Ursaring and Facade Stoutland can benefit from switching into Will-O-Wisp and threaten to KO Misdreavus after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples most physical attackers and lets Misdreavus accumulate damage on many of its switch-ins. Foul Play does huge damage to Pokemon like Guts Ursaring and Rapidash that think they can switch in for free and reliably beats Substitute variants of Bouffalant. Shadow Ball can also be used, but it is much weaker on average and leaves Misdreavus walled by many Normal-types that have ways of playing around Will-O-Wisp. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Roselia, Quilladin, and Gorebyss from recovering health or setting up, greatly aiding in wearing them down. Pain Split, though somewhat unreliable, does a decent job of keeping Misdreavus healthy. Alternatively, Memento can be used on faster variants to support teammates such as Dragon Dance Fraxure. Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple faster switch-ins such as Floatzel and support slower teammates such as Lapras.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature enable Misdreavus to outspeed Adamant Pawniard as well as positive-natured Gorebyss and Relicanth. Misdreavus's physical defense is maximized with the remaining EVs to help it take on physical attackers such as Sawsbuck as consistently as possible. Eviolite boosts Misdreavus's longevity and lets it take hits from weak foes easily. More Speed can be invested; 52 EVs with a Timid nature allow Misdreavus to outspeed Adamant Mightyena, for example, while 124 EVs with a Timid nature allow Misdreavus to outspeed Adamant Stoutland and Arbok. A specially defensive EV spread can also be used in order to better handle certain attackers such as Kadabra.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Misdreavus fits well on balanced teams as a check to many physical attackers such as Klang and Bouffalant. Taunt and Will-O-Wisp can usually be spammed to break down bulky cores consisting of Pokemon such as Stunfisk, Roselia, and Probopass. However, Misdreavus should be careful of using Taunt against some offensive threats that can take advantage of a free turn, such as Stunfisk getting off a Discharge and Probopass pivoting out with Volt Switch for free. Misdreavus also needs to be careful of using Will-O-Wisp on incoming Guts and Facade users, such as Stoutland. Switching out of Knock Off is almost always a must in order to retain Misdreavus's excellent bulk. In addition, Misdreavus should avoid taking hits from powerful special attackers such as Choice Specs Floatzel and Life Orb Raichu. Misdreavus's presence can deter Rapid Spin, and its fast Taunt can prevent Defog from slower Pokemon such as Pelipper and Vullaby. It should use Memento only when Misdreavus has little use left in the game or if a teammate absolutely needs the support to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Roselia, Audino, and Politoed, are needed as teammates to take on the powerful special attackers that threaten Misdreavus. Roselia can additionally provide Spikes support, Audino can heal Misdreavus of status and support it with Wish if necessary, and Politoed can help with the powerful Fire- and Water-types that threaten Misdreavus. All three of these Pokemon appreciate Misdreavus's physically defensive presence to handle many of their checks. Stunfisk and Probopass can provide Misdreavus with Stealth Rock support and absorb Knock Off from Pokemon such as Dodrio and Pawniard decently. Setup sweepers, such as Gorebyss and Monferno, can take advantage of potential Memento support.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Nasty Plot, Misdreavus can boost its Special Attack and threaten to open up holes in both offensive and balanced teams. Shadow Ball is a reliable STAB move with good all-around coverage. Misdreavus can generally afford to run only one coverage move: Hidden Power Fighting lets Misdreavus hit Normal- and Dark-types, such as Stoutland and Pawniard, super effectively, while Dazzling Gleam hits Vullaby and Zweilous hard. Thunderbolt is another option to give Misdreavus a super effective hit on threats such as Dodrio and Simipour and provides it with the strongest hit on Vullaby. Taunt lets Misdreavus set up more easily without fearing moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to wear down Misdreavus's checks early in the game and check physical attackers even when not attempting to sweep</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed to let Misdreavus sweep the most efficiently. A Modest nature maximizes Misdreavus's damage output, notably guaranteeing a 2HKO on Roselia after a Nasty Plot. A Timid nature, while not hugely beneficial, at least guarantees that Misdreavus will outspeed a few uncommon foes such as Jolly Monferno, Gabite, Stoutland, and Arbok. Eviolite lets Misdreavus set up comfortably on weak attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Misdreavus can take weaker hits from the likes of Roselia and Politoed, but it is worn down quickly with Stealth Rock and repeated attacks. Nasty Plot Misdreavus should be used to soften up or eliminate the likes of Vigoroth, Roselia, and Probopass to support a teammate's sweep; for example, Choice Scarf Chatot appreciates the weakening of specially defensive Pokemon like these. Misdreavus should spam Shadow Ball to wear down the likes of Eviolite Monferno before attempting to boost with Nasty Plot. With its typing, Misdreavus can also deter Rapid Spin from Armaldo and Avalugg, though it fears Knock Off from the former and Toxic on the switch in from the latter. It should also try to avoid taking Knock Off, as this will make it significantly easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast teammates such as Zebstrika, Kadabra, and Choice Scarf Chatot that appreciate special walls being weakened make for good partners; these Pokemon can also revenge kill the powerful attackers that can take Misdreavus down. Stealth Rock support is crucial to help in wearing down checks like Vullaby, while Spikes support from Roselia makes it even easier to weaken bulkier foes, especially given that Misdreavus can potentially prevent both Rapid Spin and Defog. Strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Dodrio can apply additional pressure to bulky teams.</p>"

This, however, could not be further from the truth. Wobbuffet carves itself an excellent niche as the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier without any actual use at all. This means that Wobbuffet is easily the best death fodder in the tier. Unlike other death fodder, such as Luvdisc and Emolga, Wobbuffet does not try to trick poor Trainers into thinking it could possibly be useful in any other capacity by learning damaging moves. It also does not let the opposing team set up on it, an area in which most other death fodder fails miserably. Wobbuffet is the perfect Pokemon for those situations where you desperately need to sacrifice something but can't afford to sacrifice a Pokemon with any value whatsoever.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wobbuffet has a whopping four additional moves to use outside of the ones already listed. Tickle and Charm are useful for lowering the stats of an unsuspecting foe. Safeguard protects Wobbuffet and its teammates from status conditions. Splash is another solid option for Wobbuffet; it's great for those situations in which you just need Wobbuffet to faint already so that you can finally get on with what you wanted to do after sacrificing it. Finally, Custap Berry can be used, as it makes Destiny Bond easier to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Switching Out</strong>: Unfortunately, Wobbuffet's whole strategy fails when the foe switches out, which prevents it from both being death fodder and actually hoping it will be able to damage anything.</p>",

Leftovers prevents Wobbuffet from being worn down too quickly by status ailments or entry hazards. Telepathy is Wobbuffet's only legal ability and is excellent for tricking your opponents into thinking that you are too dumb to use six viable Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wobbuffet should switch in when you want to get one of its teammates into the battle but cannot afford them taking a hit. From there, it should use Encore and hope that its foe will try to set up on it, in order to be able to say that it actually accomplished something. If it has not fainted by this point, Wobbuffet should attempt to deal damage with Counter and Mirror Coat, in the event that its foe is foolish enough to attack it directly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Frail Pokemon such as Zebstrika, Kadabra, and Simipour appreciate Wobbuffet's ability to sacrifice itself in order to give them a free switch. Additionally, setup sweepers such as Fraxure and Rain Dance Golduck do not like taking unnecessary damage before setting up and might be able to take advantage of an opponent encored into an ineffective move, so they are prime candidates to make use of Wobbuffet's help.</p>"

Unlike Clefairy, Dunsparce is less susceptible to Knock Off and can afford to use Magic Coat to prevent it from being Taunt fodder; however, when running Magic Coat, Dunsparce loses Glare, which is one of its main niches over Clefairy, whereas if Dunsparce isn't using Magic Coat, it becomes Taunt bait and unable to set up Stealth Rock, cripple its foes with Glare, or recover with Roost. It is able to cripple its foes, Ground-types included, with Glare or Body Slam, and along with Serene Grace and Headbutt, the foe will only have a 30% chance to attack. It only has one weakness, to Fighting-type moves, and is able to check top-tier threats such as Zebstrika and Ninetales.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a helpful asset for any team, as it can rack up damage on foes every time they switch and break Focus Sash and Sturdy. Body Slam, which should be used with Magic Coat, allows Dunsparce to spread paralysis with the help of Serene Grace while dealing decent damage. Alternatively, Headbutt allows Dunsparce to deal decent damage to neutral targets and has a high chance to make the foe flinch along with Serene Grace, but it isn't the best option because Dunsparce is slow and needs the chance of paralysis that Body Slam gives. Magic Coat allows Dunsparce to prevent the use of entry hazards, status moves, and Taunt. Alternatively, Glare can be used to cripple foes and allow Dunsparce the chance to use Roost as well as paraflinch its foes. Roost gives Dunsparce reliable recovery, which allows it to survive throughout games.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment along with a Careful nature maximizes Dunsparce's special bulk, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Kadabra. Leftovers gives Dunsparce passive recovery, which allows it to survive for longer periods of time. Serene Grace raises Headbutt's flinch rate and allows Dunsparce to paraflinch its foes with Glare and Headbutt.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dunsparce is often used as a lead to set up Stealth Rock early in the game, but it can also be spared until later in the game to take hits and set up Stealth Rock. Dunsparce can be switched into some special attacks, but it has trouble taking on strong special attackers with prior damage, so it should use Roost when it is low on health. Don't switch Dunsparce into strong physical attackers, as it has poor Defense. Dunsparce should most often use Glare to cripple its foes and proceed to use Headbutt continuously in order to paraflinch the foe, only giving it a 30% chance to attack. Dunsparce can be used to pivot into special attackers such as Zebstrika and set up Stealth Rock or paralyze a switch-in with Glare.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dunsparce fits best on balanced teams for its ability to take on special attacks well and provide Stealth Rock. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL can prevent foes from removing Dunsparce's Stealth Rock. Similarly, Defiant users such as Pawniard can discourage the use of Defog in order to keep Stealth Rock on the field. Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves, such as Clefairy, Pelipper, and Gourgeist, make for good partners for Dunsparce, as they are able to take on the only type that Dunsparce is weak to. Pokemon such as Roselia and Venipede are able to provide Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, which causes the foe to take more damage upon switching in. Slower Pokemon such as Golem and Camerupt appreciate Dunsparce's paralysis support from Glare, as they are able to take advantage of the foe's lowered Speed. Dunsparce appreciates Pokemon such as Pawniard and Scrappy Stoutland, which can take on Ghost-types, as Dunsparce is unable to touch them. Clerics such as Audino and Grumpig are helpful to Dunsparce to make sure it stays healthy and avoids status from moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which can cause Dunsparce to be easily worn down.</p>"

Ursaring has access to a plethora of physical moves such as Thunder Punch to hit Pelipper harder, but running it leaves it unable to handle Rock- and Steel types if it forgoes Close Combat and unable to touch Ghost-types if it drops Crunch. Therefore, if you want to run a coverage attack, Swords Dance or Protect should be replaced.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because Ursaring is always poisoned, it is easily worn down by Toxic damage as well as entry hazard damage, making it easier to be taken out.

Vullaby can take an unboosted Facade from Ursaring and heal off any damage with Roost or wear it down with Foul Play, but it is OHKOed by Facade after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Though they can't switch in on any of Ursaring's attacks, Pokemon such as Raichu and Floatzel outspeed Ursaring and can proceed to take it out with their STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Sawsbuck and Mr. Mime can outspeed and revenge kill Ursaring if it is in a weakened state.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quick Feet": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Facade is Ursaring's main attacking move, whose power doubles once Ursaring is poisoned, allowing it to deal out heavy damage against foes that don't resist it. Close Combat hits Rock- and Steel-types such as Golem and Probopass, which resist Facade. Crunch rounds out Ursaring's coverage, nailing Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL, which are immune to Facade and Close Combat. Swords Dance boosts Ursaring's Attack to extraordinary levels, allowing it do deal out even more damage. Protect can be used over Swords Dance to guarantee that Ursaring's Toxic Orb activates, but the foe can use this opportunity to switch out, use a boosting move, or set up entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack allows Ursaring to deal out the most possible damage. Maximum investment along with a Jolly nature lets Ursaring be as fast as possible, notably being able to outspeed everything up to base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Kadabra and Rapidash after Quick Feet takes effect. Quick Feet is the preferred ability, as it provides a boost to Ursaring's Speed when it is inflicted with a status condition.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ursaring can be used as an early-game wallbreaker to deal out heavy damage or as a late-game sweeper once faster Pokemon and priority users are eliminated or weak enough for Ursaring to take out on its own. Ursaring is best coming in after a teammate has fainted or off a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Vibrava. Swords Dance should be used if you predict a switch or if Ursaring has a favorable matchup against a foe such as Clefairy. It can then proceed to wear down the opponent's team for its teammates to clean up. Facade should be spammed often unless your opponent has a Pokemon that resists or is immune to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ursaring best fits on balanced or offensive teams in need of a hard-hitting wallbreaker. Ursaring greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Probopass, Metang, and Stunfisk, as it aids in wearing down foes switching in. Setup sweepers such as Regice and Fraxure appreciate Ursaring's wallbreaking support. Other Normal-types also pair well with Ursaring; Sawsbuck appreciates Ursaring's ability to handle Ghost-types, while Dodrio and Purugly appreciate Rock- and Steel-types being removed. Sticky Web support from Leavanny slows down faster threats to Ursaring, making them easier to handle. As Ursaring is worn down by entry hazards, hazard removal support from Pokemon such as Vibrava, Pelipper, and Armaldo is greatly appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Ursaring's STAB move of choice, boasting good Base Power with no drawbacks. Bulk Up boosts both Ursaring's Defense and Attack stats, enabling it to bolster its uninvested Defense stat while also giving it the power to break through defensive Pokemon such as Metang and Probopass. Rest provides Ursaring with a reliable means of recovery, and Sleep Talk ensures that Ursaring does not become passive once it is asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment is used to make Ursaring as specially bulky as possible, allowing it to best combat special attackers such as Articuno and Choice Scarf Rotom-F. Guts boosts Ursaring's Attack when it is afflicted by a status condition, which can be useful to punish Pokemon that may try to cripple Ursaring with Will-O-Wisp and increases Ursaring's damage output when it is asleep. Leftovers grants Ursaring passive recovery, allowing it to avoid the 3HKO from Zebstrika's Thunderbolt and Choice Scarf Mr. Mime's Dazzling Gleam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulk Up Ursaring is very threatening to defensive teams due to the fact that most Normal-type counters such as Mawile, Golem, and Bronzor are inherently passive and aren't able to deal with Bulk Up Ursaring's better staying power compared to the likes of Stoutland and other Ursaring variants. Make sure to use this to your advantage when looking for opportunities to set up to win; there are some situations, especially when facing teams without a Ghost-type, where Ursaring will face little resistance and only needs to be played smartly in order to sweep. When playing against offensive teams, it is advised to not try setting up too early. Offensive teams will often have multiple Pokemon that are powerful enough to overwhelm Ursaring. In most instances, Ursaring should only be using Bulk Up to apply short-term pressure to Pokemon such as Leafeon or just throwing out attacks until the Pokemon that can force it out have been removed. Keep in mind that while Bulk Up Ursaring is invested to make itself as bulky as possible, it should not be used as a wall. Ursaring only barely avoids the 3HKO from most special attacks without any prior damage; keep in mind that there is often the potential for entry hazard damage or just prior damage taken to cause such 3HKOs to happen. Do not overload Ursaring by trying to use it to perform too many roles. Bulk Up Ursaring works best as a dedicated late-game sweeper, so try to keep it as healthy as possible until you need it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With Ursaring only having a single weakness to Fighting, Pokemon such as Pelipper and Altaria should be some of the first to be considered as teammates, since they can handle the likes of Monferno and Combusken. Pokemon such as Golem and Bronzor are helpful, as they can handle powerful wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Chatot while also setting up Stealth Rock to chip away at Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Vullaby. Knock Off support from Pokemon such as Tangela and Clefairy is useful to remove items such as Leftovers and Eviolite from defensive Pokemon while also removing damage-boosting items such as Golem's Choice Band and Rotom-F's Life Orb, making it easier for Ursaring to find setup opportunities. Pokemon such as Metang and Golem can support Ursaring by carrying Toxic to lure and weaken Gourgeist-XL, one of the best counters to Bulk Up Ursaring thanks to its Ghost typing in combination with reliable recovery and Foul Play. Vullaby can take on a large number of these roles, providing a check to powerful wallbreakers such as Stoutland and having the ability to remove items with Knock Off while also removing entry hazards, which prevents Ursaring from being slowly whittled down by hazard damage.</p>"

  "Octillery": {
    "overview": "<p>Octillery has a solid Special Attack stat in conjunction with a wide movepool backed up with a powerful STAB Hydro Pump. It can also hit the entire tier for neutral or super effective damage thanks to its wide coverage, but it is extremely held back by its low Speed, causing it to work best under Trick Room or alongside Sticky Web. Outside of Trick Room or Sticky Web teams, it is outclassed by Pokemon such as Simipour, Politoed, and Floatzel, but it has a slight niche by being harder to counter. For an attacker with such great stats, Octillery's defensive capabilities aren't that bad, and it should be able to survive a few hits coming towards it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Octillery can run Assault Vest to gain more defensive capabilities in addition to the ability to take on Simipour, Mr. Mime, and other special attackers at the expense of power. Octillery could also run Expert Belt to feign Choice Specs and surprise a foe, but its damage output will sharply decrease. Octillery could run a physical set with Waterfall / Bullet Seed / Rock Blast / Gunk Shot to lure in special walls, but it's not as powerful as Octillery's special set and is overly reliant on favorable damage rolls. Acid Spray can be used to halve a foe's Special Defense, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple their Speed (but this should be done by Octillery's teammates), and Toxic can be used to wear down a bulky foe. Scald can be used to burn and cripple physical attackers as well as offer chip damage, but it doesn't have nearly as much power as Hydro Pump.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Chatot, Ursaring, Stoutland, Dodrio, and Arbok can outspeed Octillery and heavily damage it, but they won't be able to take it out without prior damage or stat boosts and don't appreciate taking any of Octillery's moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Sawsbuck, Leafeon, Jumpluff, Tangela, and Roselia can deal massive amounts of damage against Octillery, although none can switch into Ice Beam save Roselia.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zebstrika, Raichu, and Rotom-F can deal significant damage against Octillery and can KO it with some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Grumpig, Audino, Pelipper, and Clefairy are almost guaranteed not to be 2HKOed by Octillery's moves. They can, however, stall out Trick Room turns or Octillery's PP and can wear it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump gets a STAB boost and 2HKOes most Pokemon in the tier that don't resist it. Fire Blast heavily damages Pokemon that Hydro Pump doesn't hit neutrally, such as Roselia, Tangela, and Klang. Energy Ball allows Octillery to take on other Water-types such as Floatzel and Kingler. Ice Beam hits Flying- and Dragon-types such as Pelipper, Swanna, Zweilous, and Fraxure.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature with maximum Special Attack allows Octillery to deal the most damage possible, and 44 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Audino and Carbink. The remaining EVs go into HP to allow Octillery to survive as many hits as it can. If Octillery is going to be used with Trick Room, it should use a Quiet nature with no Speed EVs or IVs to allow it be as slow as possible to underspeed Probopass, Beheeyem, and other faster Pokemon. Choice Specs heavily increases the power of Octillery's moves at the expense of locking it into a single one. Life Orb allows Octillery to switch moves while still providing a power boost, but makes Octillery miss the 2HKO on Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Hypno and wears Octillery down more quickly. Sniper can allow Octillery to do even more damage on a critical hit, but it is very unreliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Octillery works best under Trick Room, especially if the setter provides Explosion or Memento support like Carbink and Misdreavus do, respectively. It also works well alongside Thunder Wave and Sticky Web users, as they can also help alleviate Octillery's poor Speed. Octillery could also work on a balanced team, considering how it doesn't have the necessary Speed to keep up with more offensive teams. Hydro Pump should be used the majority of the time unless the opponent has a Pokemon with Water Absorb such as Politoed or a Pokemon that resists Water such as Roselia.</p> <p>Weaken special walls such as Grumpig and Audino before attempting to spam Octillery's attacks so that it doesn't face as much resistances or get stalled out. Octillery has no forms of recovery, so it can be worn down by VoltTurn teams. Even though it has solid defensive stats, it shouldn't switch into strong attackers such as Ursaring and Stoutland. If Octillery is using Choice Specs, it is preferred to predict the foe's switch to punish the switch-in. However, be cautious because Octillery will be locked into that move. If possible, stay away from Pokemon with Knock Off, because losing its item takes away a lot of power from Octillery and can make it much easier for the opposing team to deal with it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room setters such as Gourgeist, Dusknoir, and Carbink can allow Octillery to make up for its subpar Speed. Slow wallbreakers such as Rampardos, Ursaring, Glaceon, and Zweilous can also deal significant damage under Trick Room. Entry hazard setters such as Carbink and Quilladin can help Octillery deal more damage against the opposing team. This can also help Octillery 2HKO Pokemon such as Audino. Cleaners such as Mr. Mime, and Ninetales appreciate Octillery's wallbreaking to give them an easier time sweeping late-game.</p> <p>Powerful physical attackers such as Stoutland, Arbok and Kingler can challenge special walls that trouble Octillery. Pokemon such as Roselia, Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Klang can take Electric- and Grass-type moves for Octillery. Pokemon such as Grumpig and Stunfisk can paralyze foes, allowing Octillery to outspeed them. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Pelipper can allow Octillery to get in the battlefield on a free switch.</p>"

  "Delibird": {
    "overview": "<p>Delibird is outclassed by all other leads in the PU metagame. While it can both set and remove entry hazards with Spikes and Rapid Spin, respectively, it has mediocre Speed and poor offenses and defenses, leaving most teams capable of outspeeding and 2HKOing it, limiting it to a single layer of Spikes. It also has a poor matchup versus other dedicated leads such as Crustle, Golem, and Glalie thanks to its terrible defensive typing; however, it is faster than most other leads and is sometimes capable of setting two layers of Spikes or nabbing a surprise KO with Destiny Bond, which is made easier thanks to its frailty. If you desparately need a lead capable of removing entry hazards, you're better off using Smeargle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Shard can be used over Icy Wind to get some chip damage with priority, but the Speed-dropping effects of Icy Wind are preferred to give Delibird more counterplay with Destiny Bond. The ability Hustle and Aerial Ace can be used to give Delibird slightly more offensive presence, but it's still weak and becomes unable to set entry hazards versus Sleep Powder Jumpluff. Delibird can make an attempt at using offensive Hustle sets with Choice Band or Life Orb but remains weak, slow, and frail, making the set totally outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Any faster Pokemon in the tier is capable of 2HKOing Delibird, forcing it to either only get up one layer of Spikes or make an attempt at getting a KO with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with a faster Taunt such as Misdreavus can prevent Delibird from setting any Spikes up at all. Even slower Taunt users such as Grumpig can limit it to a single layer of Spikes, and most take very little damage from Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon with priority moves, such as Metang, can knock Delibird down to its Focus Sash and KO it with priority before it has the chance to set multiple layers of Spikes and begin threatening opposing teams with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin and Defog Users</strong>: Pokemon that use Rapid Spin or Defog can remove Delibird's entry hazards, canceling out its purpose as a suicide lead.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is essential on Delibird, as its purpose is to set as many as possible. Rapid Spin allows it to remove entry hazards set by opposing entry hazard leads and is Delibird's main niche over other entry hazard setters. Icy Wind is used to slow down faster threats so that Delibird is able to get up a layer of Spikes and can cause them to play more carefully around the now faster Destiny Bond, although Freeze-Dry is a solid option to super effectively hit the Defoggers, such as Prinplup, attempting to remove Delibird's Spikes. Destiny Bond is its only hope of KOing foes and can force opponents to play around Delibird more carefully.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Delibird to outspeed every dedicated lead other than Glalie and Leavanny and helps it set more Spikes versus slower foes. Maximum Special Attack investment gives it slightly more offensive presence and is more effective than investing into its mediocre defenses. The last 4 EVs are put into Defense to keep Delibird's HP at an odd number, allowing it to potentially switch into Stealth Rock twice without being KOed. Vital Spirit gives Delibird an immunity to sleep, allowing it to set Spikes on or KO Jumpluff without being put to sleep and 2HKOed. Focus Sash allows it to set at least one layer of Spikes without being outsped and KOed by common Pokemon such as Rapidash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Delibird should always be used to set entry hazards as early as possible, as it won't be useful late-game. When leading, setting up Spikes is more important than getting damage with Icy Wind, as Delibird does little damage unless it's super effective. Use Icy Wind in conjunction with Destiny Bond to force opponents to play around KOing Delibird and to more easily get up Spikes when they're not attacking. If facing a faster foe with Taunt, avoid using status moves, as Delibird's reliance on its support movepool can make it rather predictable. Delibird should also be careful of freely going for Spikes versus setup sweepers, as they can use its weak offenses as a setup opportunity. Icy Wind can be used to stop sweepers such as Gorebyss by slowing them down for a teammate to revenge kill. Use Rapid Spin if the opponent spends time getting up entry hazards to keep your team free of chip damage. Be aware that lead Crustle and Golem will be able to KO Delibird regardless of its Focus Sash due to Rock Blast being a multi-hit move. However, they are slower, and Delibird can get up a layer of Spikes or use Destiny Bond versus them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Delibird fits best on offensive teams, especially hyper offense, as its Spikes are useful for teams that force plenty of switches with strong offensive presence. Spinblockers such as Dusknoir and Misdreavus can prevent Delibird's Spikes from being removed with Rapid Spin by Pokemon such as Armaldo. Defiant Pokemon such as Pawniard and Purugly can also help keep entry hazards up by pressuring Defoggers. Strong wallbreakers such as Stoutland can use Delibird's Spikes support to more quickly wear down opposing teams by weakening their few switch-ins such as Relicanth. Setup sweepers such as Huntail can also use Delibird's Spikes to more easily net KOs on bulkier foes. Stealth Rock users such as Golem and Metang can set up their entry hazards in conjunction with Delibird to wear down opposing teams quickly with chip damage. Teammates that need entry hazards off their side of the field to be effective such as Ninjask appreciate having Delibird as a lead, as it can reliably keep Stealth Rock away with Rapid Spin. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn such as Zebstrika and Purugly can use the entry hazards to rack up damage on opposing Pokemon, as they can force counters to switch into entry hazards and take an attack before needing to switch out again.</p>"

It is able to hit a wide array of Pokemon with its numerous coverage moves making it a passable option on Normal-type spam teams, but is ultimately too outclassed to be worth using. It has a good ability in Intimidate, which allows it to better take on physical attackers, as well as priority in Sucker Punch, allowing it to hit Ghost-types for super effective damage and pick off weakened foes or frail Pokemon such as Raichu; especially along with Intimidate, Sucker Punch makes for a great revenge killing tool. However, Stantler is worn down very easily, meaning it has trouble beating bulkier Pokemon that can take its hits. Even though it has Intimidate, it is very frail and can take few hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stantler can also make use of its other multiple coverage moves such as Thunderbolt for Pelipper, Shadow Ball for Gourgeist-XL, and Megahorn for Leafeon. It can also use Sap Sipper to make it a check to Grass-types, but Intimidate is more useful and Sap Sipper is incompatible with both Sucker Punch and Double-Edge. Calm Mind can be used to turn Stantler into a sweeper, boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense. Work Up can turn Stantler into a threatening mixed sweeper, boosting its Attack and Special Attack. Toxic can be used to cripple bulkier Pokemon such as Vullaby and Audino on the switch, although it makes Stantler lose out on coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL are immune to Stantler's STAB moves and take little damage from Sucker Punch; they can also severely cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp can severely weaken Stantler's main attacks, except Energy Ball and Signal Beam; Toxic can put it on a timer, forcing it to switch; and Thunder Wave can slow it down a ton.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Stunfisk and Pelipper can easily take Stantler's attacks and slowly wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stantler is easily worn down by the combination of Double-Edge recoil, Life Orb recoil, and entry hazard damage, and it lacks reliable recovery to heal back up; additionally, if Jump Kick misses, Stantler loses 50% of its health.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Pokemon that are faster than Stantler, such as Raichu and Floatzel, can OHKO it, although Stantler can KO them with Sucker Punch if they are low on health.

Sucker Punch allows Stantler to deal super effective damage to Ghost-types such as Dusknoir, which are immune to its STAB type, and allows it to pick off weakened foes or frail Pokemon such as Kadabra. Jump Kick deals super effective damage to Steel- and Rock-types such as Pawniard and Probopass, while Earthquake can additionally deal super effective damage to Fire-types but fails to hit Probopass with its Air Balloon intact; on top of that, Earthquake also has 100% accuracy and doesn't inflict recoil if it misses. Energy Ball allows Stantler to OHKO Golem once Sturdy is broken, while Signal Beam allows it to 2HKO Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Lonely nature allows Stantler to be fast enough to outspeed Pokemon such as Stoutland and Golduck, while a Hasty nature can be used for more Speed, at the cost of losing power. A Lonely nature is chosen over Adamant to preserve Stantler's Special Attack. Maximum Attack investment along with a Life Orb allows Stantler to hit very hard with its physical attacks, while the last 4 EVs are placed into Special Attack to slightly boost Signal Beam's and Energy Ball's power. Intimidate allows Stantler to take more physical hits, but it is still unable to take them well due to its frailty.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stantler shouldn't be switched into strong attacks, as it is very frail; instead, it should be switched in via Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Raichu and Ninjask. Alternatively, it can be brought in on a double switch or after a Pokemon has fainted. Stantler should be brought in against a slower Pokemon or a Pokemon that can't KO it in order to get off a free hit and wallbreak. It can be used to revenge kill weakened foes with Sucker Punch as well with the help of Intimidate. Double-Edge should be used carefully, as the recoil along with Life Orb can be detrimental. Jump Kick should be used with caution if the opponent has a Ghost-type such as Gourgeist-XL, as a miss causes Stantler to lose half of its health. Stantler can be used to lure in Normal-type spam checks such as Golem and Tangela and KO them with Energy Ball and Signal Beam, respectively, allowing other Normal-types to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stantler fits best on offensive and balanced teams for its wallbreaking capabilities. Stantler appreciates Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Probopass, as it can help it 2HKO Pokemon such as Pelipper. Probopass is also helpful in trapping Steel-types for Stantler as well as providing a slow Volt Switch to get Stantler in safely. Similarly, Stantler also appreciates Spikes and Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Roselia. Entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Vullaby and Pelipper is helpful to prevent Stantler from being worn down easily. Mr. Mime and Clefairy are good partners for Stantler, as they resist Fighting-type attacks, which Stantler is weak to, and can provide Healing Wish support for when Stantler is weakened. Setup sweepers such as Huntail and Ninetales appreciate Stantler's wallbreaking capabilities, as it can weaken threats to the two. Other Normal-types such as Ursaring and Stoutland make for good partners for Stantler, as they can wear down each other's counters for the other to sweep. Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types such as Misdreavus, Mr. Mime, and Clefairy are good partners for Stantler for their ability to take on Fighting-types. Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Krokorok can trap Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL, which can check Stantler and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

A decent Speed tier and access to every entry hazard let it perform as an exceptional suicide lead. However, Smeargle's pitiful stats and average typing make it bad in offensive and defensive roles. Even with boosting sets, Smeargle requires a tremendous amount of support. A reliance on status moves means it is also shut down by Taunt. Also, since it can really only contribute to a team as a suicide lead, Smeargle can solely be fully utilized on hyper offensive playstyles. Finally, Leavanny competes with Smeargle for a spot on Sticky Web teams because it also has offensive presence and higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Belly Drum + Extreme Speed with Technician can let Smeargle act as a late-game sweeper but requires almost an entire team's worth of support, making it not worth it. Parting Shot can be used to gain momentum and weaken attacks, and it works well with a sleep-inducing move, as Smeagle can act on a likely switch. Will-O-Wisp can be used over Nuzzle; however, it lets Fire-types in more easily, and Nuzzle can force a Pokemon not prone to Sticky Web to be slower. Magic Coat can be used to reflect Taunt and other entry hazards at the foe, forcing both players into a 50/50 position.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Outside of Magic Coat, Smeargle is almost completely useless when Taunted, and it cannot prevent it when it comes from faster users like Electrode, Misdreavus, and Floatzel.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon faster than Smeargle can put it in a really bad position, since Smeargle will only be able to set up one entry hazard and possibly put something to sleep. Zebstrika threatens it more than others do, since it is immune to Spore and Nuzzle, the two moves Smeargle uses to get extra turns to set up.</p> <p><strong>Utility</strong>: Pokemon like Bullet Seed Leafeon, Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-F, and Sleep Powder Jumpluff can all force Smeargle into a bad situation by stopping it from setting up its entry hazards or even stopping it completely.</p>",

Explosion can be used to block Rapid Spin and Defog but can be somewhat weak, since Smeargle is not intended to do much offensively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash guarantees Smeargle will survive one hit from full health, letting it always do something before going down. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Smeargle outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, such as Adamant Monferno, Adamant Stoutland, and some Grumpig variants. 252 Defense EVs let Smeargle take priority attacks slightly better to help it avoid being picked off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Smeargle as a suicide lead so that it can start pressuring the foe. Always try to put a Pokemon to sleep so that Smeargle can get both of its entry hazards up. Watch out for Grass-immune Pokemon or Vullaby coming in on Spore, though. Set up whichever entry hazard will be more important throughout the match first in case anything goes wrong, like the foe waking up too early. At Team Preview, watch out for faster Taunt Pokemon, such as Grumpig, Floatzel, and especially Electrode, since it can't be paralyzed by Nuzzle. Sometimes it's best to keep Smeargle in the back if your lead match-up looks undesirable so that it can lay more entry hazards later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slower wallbreakers like Stoutland and Mr. Mime appreciate being able to outspeed the majority of the tier with Sticky Web up. Spinblockers, such as Dusknoir and Drifblim, and Defog deterrents, such as Pawniard and Purugly, are also really good for keeping Smeargle's entry hazards up. Smeargle loves being on offensive teams, so Pokemon that can grab momentum like Rotom-F and Monferno make for excellent partners. Ground-types like Golem, Marowak, and Gabite help to stop Zebstrika and Electrode, which can effectively limit Smeargle to setting one entry hazard, if any.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>One of only two viable Fighting-type Pokemon in the PU tier, Combusken sets itself apart from its running mate Monferno through its ability Speed Boost. Combusken's access to high-powered STAB moves and its decent offensive stats allow it to run a dangerous offensive set which can accumulate Speed boosts without needing to set up. Despite having an effective and defined niche, Combusken still suffers some competition from Monferno, which boasts a higher base Speed stat as well as access to Close Combat and Mach Punch. Additionally, Combusken's access to Speed Boost isn't always enough to remedy its low Speed stat, as Combusken is still outsped by a number of offensive Pokemon at +1 and even some Choice Scarf users at +2.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance or all-out-attacking physical set can be run, but these are generally outclassed by Monferno due to the fact that Combusken lacks a powerful Fighting STAB move or a priority move. Substitute can be run to avoid priority, but sacrifices valuable coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Muk, Grumpig, and specially defensive Clefairy are just a few examples of Pokemon that boast enough special bulk to reliably switch in on and deal with Combusken. Also, since Combusken can only run one Hidden Power, sets lacking Hidden Power Ice will be walled by Altaria, while sets lacking Hidden Power Electric will be walled by Pelipper.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Combusken's unimpressive base 55 Speed means that even after a boost it is still outsped by naturally fast Pokemon such as Floatzel, Jumpluff, and Dodrio as well as all Choice Scarf users. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Chatot and Mr. Mime can even outspeed Combusken at +2. Jumpluff and Chatot can also hit Combusken through its Substitute thanks to Infiltrator and Boomburst, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Vibrava, Gabite, Marowak, and Sturdy Golem can usually take a hit and retaliate with a super effective Ground-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Politoed and Lumineon are able to take any hit from Combusken and threaten it in return with their Water-type STAB attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect allows Combusken to stall out a turn and gain a Speed boost while also scouting for potential Choice items. Fire Blast and Focus Blast are Combusken's powerful STAB moves; their high Base Power and decent coverage somewhat make up for Combusken's average Special Attack stat, with Focus Blast being strong enough to OHKO most offensive Pokemon, such as Rapidash and Floatzel, after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice hits Altaria and OHKOes Vibrava and Gabite, while Hidden Power Electric is an option to OHKO Pokemon such as Pelipper and Swanna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Speed Boost enables Combusken to act as an effective late-game cleaner. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is required to ensure that Combusken is as fast and as strong as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to outspeed the likes of Leafeon, Dodrio, and Rapidash at +1. Life Orb is a requirement on offensive Combusken, as it somewhat remedies its otherwise mediocre base 85 Special Attack stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Combusken is best used as a dedicated cleaner in the late-game, as it is too weak to wallbreak versus most teams. It is best not to switch Combusken directly into attacks, even resisted ones, as it is very frail and quickly worn down by hazards. Combusken should also be careful to keep itself out of range of being revenge killed by priority attacks. If it can do this then it will be much more threatening as a late-game cleaner. Bringing Combusken in on double switches or after a teammate has fainted is the preferred way to go. Use Protect wisely, as it is somewhat obvious that Combusken is going to use the move when facing a faster Pokemon, which can be taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Chatot provide good support for Combusken, as they are able to bust through some of the sturdier walls that it may be unable to break through, paving the way for Combusken to clean up in the late-game. Leafeon is a good partner due to its ability to check a multitude of Water- and Ground-types that may threaten Combusken and access to Knock Off to remove Eviolites of defensive Pokemon such as Vullaby and Clefairy. Pursuit support from the likes of Stoutland and Krokorok is appreciated to weaken defensive Pokemon such as Grumpig and Muk. Since many Combusken checks are Flying-types, Stealth Rock support from the likes of Golem and Metang can be useful to weaken them. Lastly, Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Rotom-F can be used to pressure the Water-types that threaten Combusken while also weakening Pokemon such as Grumpig.</p>"

Mightyena also has access to Play Rough, a great coverage move that can be an amazing asset in beating would-be counters, such as Vullaby. Dark is also a strong offensive typing, being resisted by few types. Unfortunately, Mightyena has very low base stats, with none of them being over 90. This means Mightyena needs a lot of entry hazard support to sweep, and it can be overly reliant on Sucker Punch and Moxie boosts to clean effectively. Also, Mightyena's frailty, in combination with Life Orb recoil, means that it can have trouble surviving for long.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Fang is Mightyena's best way to hit Grass-types but still isn't much stronger than Crunch and is simply worse coverage than Iron Tail. Substitute can be used on the switches Mightyena can force, allowing it to take a powerful hit, KO back, and get a free Moxie boost, at the cost of weakening Mightyena considerably combined with Life Orb. Taunt and Toxic can help deal with the defensive Pokemon Mightyena hates, but they're hard to fit on the set and are generally inferior to the coverage options already listed. Finally, Howl can be used for an Attack boost, though Moxie is usually more efficient at doing this without wasting a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Vullaby, Tangela, and Stunfisk can all take hits from Mightyena relatively well, although they can fall to a Mightyena which as accumulated enough boosts. Additionally, Mightyena's poor bulk means that even uninvested defensive Pokemon can deal significant damage to it in return.</p> <p><strong>Tanks</strong>: Offensive Pokemon with good natural bulk such as Golem, Gabite, and Gogoat can check Mightyena by taking a hit and KOing it back with their STAB attacks. Tangela is another tank that can use Sleep Powder to cripple Mightyena and has Regenerator and Synthesis to heal off any damage it has taken.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Monferno and Combusken can survive any of Mightyena's attacks at full health and KO it back with their STAB attacks. Monferno is also faster than Mightyena and can deal significant damage with Mach Punch before Mightyena's Sucker Punch. However, depending on their EV spreads and the amount of entry hazards on the field, they can both be 2HKOed by Play Rough on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute users such as Simipour and Ninetales can avoid Sucker Punch with Substitute and proceed to fire back with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon That Can Take a Sucker Punch</strong>: Due to Mightyena's poor bulk, most Pokemon that can survive a Sucker Punch and outspeed it can deal with it well. These Pokemon include Ursaring, Rapidash, Stoutland, and many more. However, most faster Pokemon without a resist are KOed by Sucker Punch at +1.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crunch is Mightyena's main STAB move, hitting most offensive Pokemon that don't resist it hard. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority move that can pick off weakened or faster Pokemon. Play Rough complements Crunch very nicely, hitting Dark-types such as Cacturne and Vullaby super effectively as well as hitting Monferno and Combusken for neutral damage. Iron Tail allows Mightyena to break through Avalugg, Golem, and Clefairy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant nature makes Mightyena as powerful and fast as possible. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed most Misdreavus variants but has little use otherwise and severely weakens Mightyena. Life Orb helps power up all of Mightyena's moves, helping it sweep much more easily. Moxie is a great ability that helps Mightyena to clean, making it stronger and harder to stop after each KO.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mightyena should be saved for late-game in order to clean through the opponent's weakened team and accumulate Moxie boosts. Don't try to sweep if one of Mightyena's checks or counters is healthy enough to reliably beat it, or else the sweep will be cut short. If an opposing Pokemon is faster and has a non-attacking move, the opponent might use this to try to stall out Sucker Punch's low PP. As such, be careful about wasting all of Mightyena's Sucker Punch PP, and don't be afraid to use Crunch if it seems your opponent is continually stalling.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is an absolute must, as it helps wear down opposing Pokemon to the point where Mightyena can KO them. Good Stealth Rock setters include Golem, Relicanth, and Stunfisk, while good Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters include Roselia and Venipede. Mightyena hates physical walls such as Avalugg, and Tangela, making special attackers such as Rotom-F, Ninetales, and Simipour good teammates. Bulky Dark resists such as Vullaby can survive a Play Rough, making Flying-types such as Swanna and Dodrio good teammates to help deal with them. As Mightyena isn't very strong, powerful wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Leafeon make for good partners to deal with opposing stall teams.</p>"

Any offensive set is outclassed by the stronger and faster Butterfree, and is a waste of a team slot that could otherwise accommodate a huge array of superior setup sweepers. Dustox requires investment into its bulk to be usable, leaving its pathetic base 50 Special Attack uninvested. Therefore, it is miserably weak even after several boosts, failing to even 2HKO a large number of Pokemon in the metagame. Dustox barely carves out its niche in access to Shield Dust, Iron Defense, and slightly better defensive typing than Butterfree. Its Poison typing and Shield Dust provide it with an immunity to Toxic as well as to any crippling burn or paralysis from moves such as Scald and Body Slam. Despite this, other bulky set up sweepers such as Calm Mind Duosion and Clefairy tend to outclass Dustox due to their superior strength, ability, and typing, meaning they require less support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive spread can be used to set up with greater ease against physically attacking walls such as Bouffalant. Sludge Bomb can also be chosen over Iron Defense to reliably take on Fairy-types such as Calm Mind Clefairy. However, Sludge Bomb is only a usable option on an offensive set, where Dustox is outclassed by Butterfree. Kee Berry gives Dustox a one-time Defense boost if that is deemed more useful than the passive recovery from Black Sludge. Whirlwind lets Dustox phaze opposing phazers before they can do the same; however, phazers are rather rare, so it isn't usually worth giving up a valuable moveslot for.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Choice Band users such as Stoutland, Dodrio, and Rampardos put intense pressure on Dustox with their STAB attacks and easily force it out. Most offensive Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Flareon, have no trouble switching into Bug Buzz and KOing Dustox with strong Fire-type moves. Psychic-types are not recommended, as they can be outsped and KOed with some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Pokemon</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Monferno and Mawile can use Dustox as setup fodder. Soundproof Mr. Mime is immune to Dustox's only attacking move and is free to set up Nasty Plot as well. Jumpluff can put Dustox to sleep and, after a Swords Dance, can OHKO even +2 Defense Dustox with Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Dustox from setting up or healing, leaving it only able to use a weak attack. Notable users that can Taunt Dustox and come out on top include Dodrio, Floatzel, and Nasty Plot Misdreavus; however, Floatzel and Misdreavus can lose if Dustox uses Quiver Dance as they switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance and Iron Defense allow Dustox to bolster both its special and physical defenses, in theory enabling it to amass boosts while periodically recovering health and to eventually sweep with Bug Buzz. Bug Buzz is the strongest STAB move available, chosen over Sludge Bomb because that way only rare Soundproof users wall Dustox rather than all Steel-types. Roost keeps Dustox healthy, allowing it to heal off residual damage and continue to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge provides passive recovery, letting Dustox boost more frequently instead of being forced to Roost. Shield Dust allows it to set up on weak or resisted attacks such as Scald, Body Slam, and Discharge, without fearing their crippling secondary effects. This means that, unlike most setup sweepers, Dustox takes advantage of passive, defensive Pokemon rather than being threatened by them. With the given EVs and a Calm nature, Dustox outspeeds Zebstrika, Floatzel, Jumpluff, and most other non-Choice Scarf Pokemon at +2 Speed while retaining as much bulk as possible to set up on special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dustox poses virtually no threat to a well-built team early-game, so it should only be used as a pivot until its checks and counters are extremely weakened or removed. It is pointless, and sometimes dangerous, to attempt a sweep while there are still phazers or healthy wallbreakers on the opposing team. Roost should be used frequently, as being at high HP minimizes the chance of falling to a critical hit. Dustox is not able to beat strong attackers without multiple boosts, so it should only be brought in on defensive Pokemon or after a teammate has fainted. Dustox should also not be switched in frequently, as entry hazards can quickly wear it down without the opportunity to Roost. However, its typing, at least, lets it switch in easily on Roselia and Tangela thanks to its 4x resistance to Grass. Unless Dustox is sent in on a physical attacker, Quiver Dance is the optimal opening move. The ensuing +1 Speed should allow Dustox to choose which defensive stat to boost next according to the Pokemon switched in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dustox works best on defensive or balanced teams, as it can possibly sweep, absorbs Toxic Spikes, and can easily take otherwise frustrating moves like Scald. It is very hard to find an excuse to use it on offensive teams because it is extremely passive and drains momentum quickly, giving a free switch in to many threatening Pokemon. Even so, strong wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Simipour can aid Dustox with their ability to break holes in the opposing team. With Stealth Rock taking 1/4 of its HP upon switching in, as well as Spikes wearing it down, Dustox does not appreciate entry hazards on its side of the field. Worthwhile teammates that provide hazard removal and type synergy include Pelipper, Cryogonal, and Vibrava. It can often force switches against defensive Pokemon, so Pokemon that set up entry hazards make for good teammates. Most Rock- and Steel-types can use Stealth Rock and compensate for Dustox's vulnerability to strong Flying- and Normal-type attacks. Steel-types such as Probopass take on Jumpluff, while Rock-types ward off Rapidash and other Fire-type attackers. These Pokemon also appreciate Dustox absorbing Fighting-type attacks. While Dustox is immune to status as the secondary effect of an attacking move, Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Sleep Powder give it trouble. Therefore, Pokemon that can absorb status, such as Clefairy and Pokemon with Heal Bell, such as Audino, make for excellent teammates.</p>"

However, the ability Truant completely holds Slaking back from being effective in competitive play, almost negates its amazing stats, and can make it lose to Protect and Substitute. Truant also makes Slaking setup fodder for, most importantly, Speed-boosting Pokemon such as Huntail, Fraxure, and Regice; Slaking will then be outsped and unable to Encore the foe into a boosting move. Due to its horrendous ability, there is absolutely no reason to use Slaking over Bouffalant, Ursaring, or Stoutland.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slaking could run a Choice Band or Choice Scarf and an attacking move in place of Encore, but it loses out on its utility and is beaten by setup sweepers. Retaliate can hit extremely hard if Slaking is functioning as a revenge killer, but it takes up a moveslot and isn't always needed. Using Giga Impact might seem like a good idea, as the recharge turn and Truant turn match up, but Slaking cannot switch out while recharging, making it easily revenge killed or set up on. Facade can be used to allow Slaking to still function if it gets statused but takes up an important moveslot. Pursuit can trap threatening Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Mr. Mime, Kadabra, and Misdreavus, and get extra damage on a switching foe, but more often than not, it's unneeded. Slaking can run Thunder Punch or Thunderbolt for Pelipper, but it hits little else. Fire Blast or Ice Beam can be used to take on Tangela and Gourgeist-XL. Gunk Shot can be used to take on Tangela, but it is inefficient to run a move for just one Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect completely blocks Slaking's usefulness, as the foe can just Protect as Slaking is going to attack and either set up or weaken it when it cannot attack. Substitute can perform the same role, but doesn't have priority behind it, meaning the Pokemon using it has to be faster than Slaking, such as Simipour.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Simipour, Ninetales, Regice, and Monferno can set up on Slaking during Truant, and fire off a huge hit against it or its teammate. Slower setup sweepers with priority moves, such as Pawniard, need to watch out for an Encore.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Walls</strong>: Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, Avalugg, and Air Balloon Probopass, among others, can take on Slaking remotely well and either recover when Truant comes into play or inflict it with a status.</p>",

Night Slash takes on Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, which are immune to Return, and due to Levitate, many of them are immune to Earthquake as well, bar Dusknoir. Encore can lock foes into a setup or status move and force them to switch out, offering your team momentum as well as preventing Slaking from being setup fodder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs paired with a Jolly nature allow Slaking to be as fast and hit as hard as it can, when it isn't slacking off. Life Orb gives Slaking's attacks more power but quickly wears it down, making it easier to revenge kill or take out during a Truant turn. Silk Scarf only raises the power of Slaking's Normal-type moves, but doesn't chip away at its health. Truant is Slaking's only legal ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't rely on Slaking, as Truant holds it back from being an effective sweeper. When using Slaking, it should switch in, fire off a hit, and then switch out so it can stay healthy. If the opponent has a Ghost-type Pokemon, the Slaking user has to predict if they will switch in and select the appropriate move.

Flying-types, such as Jumpluff, Dodrio, Articuno, and Chatot, can take on Monferno and physically defensive Grass-types such as Tangela for Slaking, giving it an easier time wallbreaking. Choice Scarf users, such as Simipour, Raichu, and Mr. Mime, can outpace Pokemon which attempt to set up on Slaking, although they have to be wary of attacking moves, as they are frail. Slow users of Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Probopass or Pelipper, can give Slaking a free switch onto the field to fire off an attack. Focus Sash Kadabra will always survive a hit due to Magic Guard, so it can easily use Thunder Wave to stop set up sweepers that try to set up on Slaking.</p>"

However, Ninjask's Attack stat is mediocre at best, and it struggles to break through much of the tier. Ninjask's terrible bulk, weaknesses to common types, and weakness to Stealth Rock make it very hard to switch in. Ninjask's offensive movepool is also incredibly small and weak.</p>",

Final Gambit is useful to take something out early game. Giga Drain can be run in the final slot to do more damage to defensive Relicanth and Golem, but it is very weak and generally not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock strips 50% of Ninjask's health every time Ninjask comes in, making it a huge thorn in Ninjask's side. Other residual statuses, such as a burn and poison, will wear down Ninjask to the point of being KOed. This is incredibly noticeable because Ninjask is going to be switching in and out a lot, so it must remain healthy. Burns also make Ninjask even weaker than before.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Ninjask only has base 90 Attack, which leaves bulky Pokemon such as physically defensive Audino and Stunfisk shrugging off its attacks. Its only hope against these Pokemon is to utilize U-turn to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Relicanth, Probopass, and Golem can all easily KO Ninjask, although Probopass requires Stealth Rock up if it is not running the rare Power Gem.

Aerial Ace hits Fighting-types, such as Monferno, that would otherwise resist U-turn and has solid coverage all-around. Fire-types that resist U-turn, such as Ninetales and Rapidash, are also hit by Aerial Ace harder than anything else Ninjask carries. X-Scissor is used alongside U-turn because it's more consistent later in the match when Ninjask will not want to switch out and is more powerful than Aerial Ace. Night Slash hits Misdreavus and provides a neutral hit on Steel-types such as Probopass.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed maximize offensive capability. Instead of running 4 HP EVs, 4 Defense EVs are used to give Ninjask an odd HP number, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock twice versus once. A Jolly nature is chosen because Ninjask is capable of outspeeding Choice Scarf Mr. Mime and Rotom-F with it. Choice Band is preferred for maximum damage output to wear down opposing teams quickly, while Insect Plate allows Ninjask to threaten a late-game sweep with Swords Dance while still being an effective pivot. Infiltrator gets around Substitutes, while Speed Boost could be used because it allows Ninjask to do a bit more work late-game without fearing Choice Scarf, sun, or rain; however, neither is very useful in the long run.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ninjask should really stick to clicking U-turn early in the match because it allows Ninjask to grab momentum and get out of its checks. Later in the match, Ninjask can be a little bit looser. X-Scissor is more useful at this point to clean up because it's more powerful than U-turn and doesn't make Ninjask switch out. Ninjask absolutely needs entry hazards off of the field, so remove them as soon as possible or do not switch Ninjask in. While Ninjask can't really switch into much by itself, it can sort of switch in to some Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon thanks to its 4x resistance to their STAB moves, but it has to be careful. Being worn down is a big issue, so try to keep it in a range where priority from the likes of Pawniard or Mightyena will not KO it. Avoid status, specifically paralysis and burn, at all costs because it absolutely neuters all of Ninjask's offensive capability. If using Swords Dance, Ninjask cannot effectively set up versus most Pokemon thanks to its poor bulk, so this should generally be used when foes switch on the predicted U-turn or versus weaker foes such as Audino.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electric-types, such as Zebstrika, Raichu, and Rotom-F, keep up momentum via Volt Switch and offers great defensive synergy. Entry hazard removal is required no matter what, so a Rapid Spin user like Armaldo or a Defog user like Pelipper make for good partners. Water-types, such as Simipour and Floatzel, and Fighting-types, such as Monferno, appreciate Ninjask's ability to weaken Grass-types and Psychic-types, respectively. Probopass traps Steel-types and can form a VoltTurn core with Ninjask. Entry hazard support is appreciated. Roselia is a solid Spikes setter; Golem and Stunfisk are solid Stealth Rock setters. Setup Pokemon, such as Ninetales, Huntail, and Pawniard, all appreciate the pivoting abilities that Ninjask provides. Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types as a collective group are good partners because they can hit Steel-types. Gabite, Ninetales, and Monferno are a few examples. Pokemon that are threatened by Grass-types, such as Stunfisk, appreciate Ninjask's ability to put offensive pressure on it. Note that Fire-types do stack a Stealth Rock weakness though.</p>"

  "Shedinja": {
    "overview": "<p>Shedinja's ability, Wonder Guard, is like no other, allowing it to dodge every move that isn't super effective; the ability can be amazing late-game. Wonder Guard also grants Shedinja the ability to take on threats in the metagame such as Simipour, Raichu, Regice, and Rotom-F. Though Shedinja has many immunities, it's also weak to some of the most common types in the tier. Also, its abysmal HP stat will always stay at 1, no matter how much you invest in it, meaning that Shedinja is instantly KOed by the likes of entry hazards, Toxic, burn, Leech Seed, and weather conditions such as hail and sand. Shedinja needs to be put on a balanced team that is built around it to function to the best of its ability. Offensive entry hazard removers don't have the bulk required to switch in and use Defog, and because there aren't good Magic Bounce users in PU, barring Natu, using Shedinja can become difficult when done incorrectly, especially in an entry hazard-based metagame. Swords Dance doesn't turn Shedinja into the tier's best sweeper but, with its unique ability, Shedinja can still be a thorn in the side of teams that lack the tools to properly handle it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shedinja could run Toxic to break down walls that it has issues with, such as Tangela, Pelipper, and Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Any Pokemon with access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes is dangerous, as they can prevent Shedinja from switching in if they have set up entry hazards. This includes Pokemon such as Golem, Venipede, and Crustle. Moreover, Golem, Crustle, and Armaldo can OHKO Shedinja with Rock Blast regardless of its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Shedinja's ability doesn't block Dark-, Fire-, Flying-, Ghost-, and Rock-type moves. These moves can either take Shedinja down to its Focus Sash or KO Shedinja if it has used its Focus Sash. These moves can be used by Pawniard, Mightyena, Ninetales, Dodrio, Jumpluff, Pelipper, Misdreavus, and Golem. Shedinja is not completely terrible against some of these Pokemon, as it can burn them or lure them. Some Fire- and Ghost-type Pokemon also have access to Will-O-Wisp and can be very scary against Shedinja.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Sources of residual damage include entry hazards, poison, burn, Leech Seed, and damaging weather. Most walls, such as Audino and Bronzor, have Toxic, which Shedinja needs to be wary of. Also, be prepared to face Leech Seed from Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL or Tangela. Avoid staying in against Hippopotas, as it can KO Shedinja with Sand Stream.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Shedinja's attack, using Pokemon that cannot threaten it as setup fodder to potentially sweep teams. X-Scissor and Shadow Sneak are STAB moves that can deal some solid damage to opposing Pokemon. X-Scissor is used for dealing more damage, while Shadow Sneak is used to pick off weakened foes. Shadow Sneak can also be used to revenge kill Pokemon such as weakened Kadabra and Mr. Mime. Protect allows Shedinja to scout the foe's moves and make a play accordingly. Protect can be a life saver against Pokemon with unexpected moves and can give you knowledge for the late-game. Will-O-Wisp is a solid move for spreading burns onto physical attackers or offering some chip damage against other Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Speed and Attack allow Shedinja to hit as quickly and as hard as possible. Because Shedinja's maximum HP stat never changes, adding extra bulk will do nothing to help it survive hits; on the other hand, minimizing bulk gives Shedinja a marginally better matchup against the occasional Ditto, as minimum investment and a  defense reducing nature ensures Shadow Sneak will always OHKO. A Lonely nature is preferred over Hasty, as the extra Speed from Hasty doesn't let Shedinja outspeed any important threats. Focus Sash is the best item for Shedinja, letting it survive any attacking move barring multi-hit moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not be scared to sacrifice Shedinja to burn a threat to your team or gain momentum. Trying to conserve Shedinja and sacrificing one of your other Pokemon instead can come back to hurt you. If an opponent is lacking in ways to combat Shedinja, save it for the late-game. Do not switch in Shedinja when entry hazards are on your side of the field. Be wary of Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Dusknoir. Shedinja needs to be cautious to avoid residual damage. Shedinja needs to be alert when facing a potential Rock Blast user, such as Golem. Usually, Shedinja should only use Will-O-Wisp or Swords Dance when it forces the foe to switch out, as it cannot do much damage unboosted, but double switching can be effective since Wonder Guard limits potential switchins. Shedinja should be used as a pivot or to check attackers that can't touch it. When you aren't sure what the opponent is going to use against Shedinja or when they make a strange switch, scout with Protect instead of hard switching. Shedinja can lure in Dark-types and trade its Focus Sash for a KO or switch to a teammate to take them on. If Shedinja loses its Focus Sash, it can still be a huge game changer in the long run.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Always pair Shedinja with Defog or Rapid Spin users, such as Pelipper, Vullaby, and Avalugg. This allows Shedinja to switch into the field without worrying about entry hazards, which will instantly knock it out. Shedinja only fits well on balanced teams; it does not work effectively on offensive teams because it needs entry hazard removal support from a Pokemon that won't get taken out easily. Shedinja also needs Pokemon that can take status inflictions and moves that it is weak to. Natu can be a solid Magic Bounce user that can switch in on an entry hazard setup or status move and bounce it back. Pokemon that can take a status move for Shedinja include Clefairy, Stoutland, and Ursaring. Pokemon such as Stoutland, Pawniard, and Mightyena can take on Ghost-types effectively and can help take out some of the biggest threats to Shedinja. Shedinja likes having Water-types on its side to take on Rock- and Fire-types; some of the best options are Politoed, Pelipper, and Golduck. Rock-type Pokemon such as Golem and Relicanth can assist in taking out Fire- and Flying-types. Ground-type Pokemon such as Stunfisk can help take on Rock-type Pokemon as well as set up Stealth Rock, which Shedinja appreciates as it can frequently force switches. Spikes setters such as Roselia and Quilladin are useful for the same reason.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mawile has a great typing that allows it to check popular Normal- and Grass-types such as Stoutland, Roselia, and Cacturne. Great offensive prowess with Sheer Force-boosted attacks further augmented by Life Orb and the option of going mixed make it a great wallbreaker capable of destroying common defensive cores. Despite mainly being a wallbreaker, it can also sweep offensive teams with Swords Dance-boosted Sucker Punches if given a setup opportunity. Mawile can also pull off a defensive set to check common physical attackers and provide Stealth Rock, though unfortunately, bad natural bulk prevents Mawile from making full use of its great typing because most specially offensive Pokemon such as Mr. Mime will still 2HKO it. It is also overreliant on Sucker Punch against faster Pokemon, which can be exploited with moves such as Substitute and Will-O-Wisp and also makes it not very hard to revenge kill by faster Pokemon that can take one hit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band sets with Knock Off are amazingly strong but are generally not worth it because the need for prediction becomes bigger and they make Sucker Punch virtually unusable. Rock Slide could work to catch Fire-types off guard but is generally not as good as the other coverage moves Mawile would use. Super Fang can be used on the defensive set as a way to cripple whatever Pokemon the opponent decides to switch into it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales can switch in on any move Mawile usually carries and force it out with their STAB moves, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, or set up on it with Nasty Plot. Monferno cannot switch in on Play Rough but can scare Mawile out and steal momentum with U-turn or set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Klang and Metang fear Fire Blast but can often take a hit and deal good damage back or take advantage of Mawile by setting up Shift Gear or Stealth Rock, and they also defeat any set without Fire Blast. Probopass stands out here because it can also trap Mawile with Magnet Pull.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Stunfisk can switch in a few times and scare Mawile out with their STAB moves or set up Stealth Rock. Other Ground-types such as Gabite cannot safely switch into Mawile but can force it out if given a free switch in.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Gourgeist-XL and Relicanth are bulky enough to switch into Mawile most of the time and burn it with Will-O-Wisp or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can take a Sucker Punch such as Floatzel and Altaria can also revenge kill Mawile but lack the ability to switch into it.</p>",

Mawile is best used early- or mid-game to break down walls so other Pokemon or sometimes itself can sweep. However, Swords Dance makes Mawile a threatening sweeper in the late-game as well. Avoid switching Mawile into strong attacks because it does not take hits very well. Instead, try to switch it in safely by use of moves such as Volt Switch and U-turn, or through double switches.

Defensively, anything remotely strong will negate its presence completely, and it's even frailer than its cousin Minun. In addition, its Ruby Pokedex entry states that Plusle will cry loudly if its teammates lose.

Once in it can proceed to set up Curse or force Roselia out with a Choice Band Gunk Shot or Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Type Advantage</strong>: Fire-types such as Monferno and Rapidash resist Giga Drain and can take a Sludge Bomb and retaliate back with their Fire-type STAB moves or use Roselia as setup fodder. Flying-types such Dodrio and Jumpluff can revenge kill Roselia, but most offensive ones do not have the bulk to take a Sludge Bomb. Psychic-types such as Beheeyem and Kadabra can set up Nasty Plots or Calm Minds on Roselia and can deal heavy damage with their STAB moves. Ice-types such as Articuno, Rotom-F, and Regice can KO Roselia with their STAB moves and can easily take a hit or use Roselia as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to its low physical bulk, Roselia is easily revenge killed by strong attackers such as Stoutland and Ursaring. Ursaring can force Roselia out and set up a Swords Dance, and it can survive a weak hit if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Bronzor can easily stall Roselia out of Synthesis PP and whittle it down. They can't do much about Spikes, though.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off severely weakens Roselia's ability to take hits, allowing Pokemon such as Life Orb Raichu to 2HKO it when they otherwise couldn't. Although Roselia can force switches against common users, Pokemon such as Leafeon can surprise Roselia with Knock Off on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Metang can easily take any hit from Roselia and can set up entry hazards or wear it down with repeated hits. Pawniard can set up Swords Dances on Roselia, while Klang can freely Shift Gear and does not worry about Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Defog users such as Swanna and Vullaby are not affected by Roselia's entry hazards and have a type advantage over Roselia, while Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal and Armaldo have either a type advantage over Roselia or access to Knock Off to cripple it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes continually weakens the opponent's team, damaging Pokemon that try to switch in on Roselia. Synthesis is crucial to let Roselia consistently switch into special attackers. Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types and Clefairy super effectively while also hitting Flying- and Fire-types for neutral damage, and Giga Drain provides some recovery and hits Water-types for super effective damage. Sleep Powder is the best move to hit Muk and other switch-ins and provides more opportunities to set up Spikes. Toxic Spikes wears down the opponent's team, which is helpful for stalling on defensively based teams, but it's usually not worth it due to the prevalence of opposing Poison-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread provides decent mixed bulk combined with Eviolite. It allows Roselia to avoid the OHKO from Modest Gorebyss after a Shell Smash with Stealth Rock most of the time, as well as always avoid the 2HKO from Floatzel's Ice Beam without Stealth Rock. Maximum Special Defense EVs can be used to more effectively check special attackers, but with increasing investment, Roselia's Special Defense increases at a slower rate. A more physically defensive spread can also be used to take on Pokemon such as Leafeon with more ease, but many physical attackers can beat Roselia anyway. 96 Speed EVs can be used to let Roselia outspeed base 45 Speed Pokemon such as Golem and Armaldo, but running those EVs takes away from Roselia's necessary bulk. Natural Cure allows Roselia to absorb status and prevents it from being worn down too much from Scald burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its decent bulk and typing, Roselia is a premier switch-in to special attackers such as Raichu and Simipour and can check physical attackers such as Leafeon, but it has to be careful of taking too much damage, due to Synthesis's low PP. Roselia's main priority is to set up entry hazards, which it can easily do on predicted switches, but if the opponent has ways to remove entry hazards, getting off damage might be more helpful. Setting up Spikes is preferred if the opponent has a Poison-type, as they can absorb Toxic Spikes upon switching in. Roselia should be wary about switching into Pokemon that might carry a move to beat Roselia, such as Knock Off Simisage and Simipour.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roselia is better used on balanced teams, which appreciate entry hazards and a Pokemon to check special attackers, but it can work on offensively based ones as a defensive switch-in to select foes. Golem is a particularly good teammate, as it provides Stealth Rock and can check Flying-types. Steel-types such as Probopass, Metang, Bronzor, and Mawile beat Ice-, Flying-, and Psychic-types and appreciate the removal of Water-types. Ghost- and Dark-types such as Misdreavus and Pawniard check Psychic-types and function as spinblockers or Defog deterrents to keep Roselia's entry hazards on the field.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm beats some bulkier Pokemon such as Probopass and helps Roselia check Water-types. Sludge Bomb provides good neutral coverage, hitting Pokemon that resist Grass, such as Tangela and Monferno. Sleep Powder cripples switch-ins such as Cryogonal, Muk, and Grumpig, allowing Roselia to set up Spikes. Hidden Power Ground allows Roselia to hit Poison- and Steel-types, namely Muk and Pawniard, preventing them from setting up on Roselia for free. Spikes is a valuable asset to any team, as it weakens the opponent's Pokemon every time they switch in, which is especially useful because Roselia forces many switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature allow Roselia to hit as hard as possible. 216 Speed EVs let Roselia beat Pawniard as well as Pokemon with a neutral nature and base 45 Speed such as Golem. The remaining EVs go in HP to increase its bulk, which is backed up by Eviolite. Natural Cure is its most relevant ability, allowing it to freely take Scalds and other status moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roselia should be switched in against weaker special attackers and ones that it has a type advantage over, such as Lumineon and Tangela, but without Synthesis, Roselia should try to not take too much damage. When in, Roselia should either set up entry hazards or deal damage depending on its team's priorities, but if the opponent has a Pokemon such as Audino or Bronzor that can switch in and wall Roselia, it should either set up entry hazards on the switch or put them to sleep. Roselia is best used early- and mid-game to set up entry hazards or check strong attackers, but it can be saved at high health for late-game if the opponent has Pokemon such as Floatzel, which Roselia needs to be at high health to check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roselia fits best on offensive teams that need switch-ins to powerful special attackers such as Raichu and contain Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards. Fighting-types such as Monferno beat Steel-types that wall Roselia, and in return, Roselia beats Tangela, which those Pokemon have trouble with. Water- and Rock-types such as Prinplup and Golem both beat Fire-types; Water-types also check Ice-types and appreciate the removal of Grass- and Water-types, and Rock-types beat Flying-types and enjoy Roselia's ability to check Water- and Ground-types. Stealth Rock, from setters such as Golem and Stunfisk, works well with Spikes, increasing the amount of damage the opponent's Pokemon take when switching in. Dark- and Ghost-types such as Pawniard and Misdreavus also check Psychic-types. Ghost-types are particularly appreciated, as they can block Rapid Spin. Steel-types such as Probopass check Psychic-, Ice-, and Poison-types and can set up Stealth Rock. Pawniard is a particularly good teammate, as it can deter the use of Defog, and in return Roselia beats bulky Water-types.</p>"

  "Swalot": {
    "overview": "<p>Swalot is not an amazing Pokemon in the metagame, as it is mostly overshined by Roselia; however, it does have a niche. Although it lacks Spikes and recovery, it can wall more and different Pokemon such as Knock Off Simipour and Ninetales. Swalot has decent bulk with Assault Vest but lacks recovery, making it prone to being worn down and limiting its ability to switch in. It should only really be used if the team has weaknesses to the specific Pokemon Swalot can wall, such as those prior mentioned. Fortunately it has amazing coverage, and with offensive investment it can hit hard enough to prevent other Pokemon from setting up on it. Additionally, its typing, although not providing many important resistances outside Grass, does not provide many relevant weaknesses to common special attacks and lets it absorb Toxic Spikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gunk Shot can be used over Sludge Bomb with some Attack EVs to let Swalot deal decent damage to Roselia, and Liquid Ooze can also be used on the set if its team is weak to Leech Seed users and certain Grass-types. Acid Spray can be used to prevent Swalot from being setup fodder for bulky setup sweepers, but Swalot lacks the moveslot. A utility set with moves such as Encore and Pain Split can be used; it trades walling more Pokemon with Assault Vest for recovery, but it receives even more competition from Roselia. Choice Band can be used for its surprise factor and can be EVed to outspeed lead Golem and KO it with Bullet Seed. Choice Specs can also be used for more immediate power, and although it receives competition from Seviper, Swalot has a niche in its bulk. Custap Berry along with Destiny Bond can score a possible surprise KO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Swalot's main weakness is its lack of recovery, meaning that Stealth Rock, Spikes, and chip damage severely weaken it and often put it in KO range of special attackers. Burns from Will-O-Wisps and Scalds from Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Pelipper also annoy it, especially because it likes to switch into the latter.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Gabite can deal heavy damage with Earthquake or set up Stealth Rock, but it heavily dislikes switching in on an Ice Beam. Stunfisk and Camerupt can take a hit better, as they do not have 4x weaknesses, but the former does not do too much damage with Earth Power and both lack recovery.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Assault Vest only boosts Swalot's Special Defense, meaning it is more vulnerable to physical hits, especially because it does not invest EVs into it. Pokemon such as Ursaring and Stoutland can capitalize on this and easily revenge kill Swalot.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Bronzor can take multiple hits and proceed to recover off lost damage. Grumpig in particularly avoids the 3HKO and can retaliate with Psychic. Bulky setup sweepers such as Beheeyem and Duosion can use Swalot as setup fodder, and the latter does not care about being poisoned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is Swalot's main STAB move with a nice chance to poison the foe. Giga Drain hits Rock-, Water-, and certain Ground-types such as Golem and Floatzel hard. Ice Beam hits most Ground-types such as Gabite harder, as well as Pokemon such as Jumpluff, and it is Swalot's strongest move against Ghost-types such as Misdreavus. Earthquake 2HKOes Pawniard and Probopass, which would otherwise wall Swalot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest turns Swalot into a special tank, and the EVs allow Swalot to take three Hydro Pumps from Life Orb Simipour after Stealth Rock damage and Giga Drain recovery as well as three Thunderbolts from Zebstrika. The rest is dumped in Special Attack for more power, and a Quiet nature is chosen to boost this more. It is required over Modest to let Swalot 2HKO Probopass. Sticky Hold helps against Knock Off Clefairy and Simipour and is Swalot's least situational ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swalot can be switched into special attackers such as Simipour, Simisage, and Rotom-F, but it should not be switched into too many strong attacks due to its lack of recovery, limiting the number of times it can switch in. Although it may wall Roselia, be wary of switching into it, as it can use Swalot as entry hazard bait. Additionally, it should be wary of switching into Pokemon such as Politoed, which can burn Swalot with Scald, severely weakening it for the rest of the match. After being weakened from taking on special attackers, it is fine to sack Swalot, as outside checking specific Pokemon, it does not do much. Swalot is also a decent absorber of the, albeit rare, move Trick, so Swalot can be switched into users such as Rotom-F if predicted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swalot fits best on balanced and often bulky offensive teams to check specific special attackers that tend to threaten those builds. Flying- and Grass-types such as Pelipper and Tangela check Ground-types, which are the most threatening Pokemon to Swalot. Steel- and defensive Psychic-types such as Probopass and Grumpig check offensive Psychic-types. Ghost- and Dark-types such as Misdreavus and Pawniard can offensively threaten Psychic-types but dislike switching in on them. Audino can provide Wish support for Swalot to prevent it from being worn down too easily. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Pelipper and Armaldo is greatly appreciated, as otherwise Swalot gets worn down too quickly. Pokemon that can immediately pressure Roselia such as Dodrio and Rapidash are important in preventing Roselia from setting up entry hazards on Swalot. Phazers such as Altaria, though fairly specific, can be very helpful, as Swalot often finds itself setup fodder for bulky sweepers such as Duosion.</p>"

  "Wailord": {
    "overview": "<p>Wailord's only niche is PP stalling the foe, as it can't do much else without being outclassed by other Water-types. However, even Wailord's PP stalling set requires an enormous amount of support that typically only stall teams can provide, and it can be shut down easily. Additionally, stall is a less reliable playstyle in the metagame due to the massive number of threats to it, such as Simipour and Dodrio. Wailord also suffers from its mediocre bulk, which can make it difficult for it to switch into attackers; it also is Spikes fodder for Roselia and setup fodder for Gogoat, Jumpluff, and Leafeon. As a bulky Water-type, Wailord faces competition from Politoed, which has better overall bulk and an immunity to Scald and can take on Clefairy and Duosion by Perish trapping them. Luckily, Wailord has just enough bulk to have merit on stall teams by virtue of its massive HP and small utility, being able to counter certain stallbreakers such as Duosion if it has set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used over Scald if Toxic Spikes support isn't being used, while Roar has some merit over Scald if Wailord is used with Spikes, although Wailord generally does better without it. A Curse set gives Wailord a radically different function from the standard set, but it's slow, relatively weak, and outclassed. However, it can grab a surprise KO with Self-Destruct. Special sets such as a Choice Specs set can utilize a relatively strong Water Spout and Hydro Pump, but they are outclassed by Floatzel and Simipour due to Wailord's low Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Roselia</strong>: Roselia can stall out Wailord, set up as many entry hazards as it wishes, and absorb Toxic Spikes, which Wailord is generally paired with.</p> <p><strong>Jumpluff</strong>: Infiltrator Jumpluff can bypass both Substitute and Toxic Spikes and 2HKO Wailord with Seed Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage in the form of status and Leech Seed completely ruins Wailord's PP stalling strategy.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Dodrio and Stoutland can stop Wailord from setting up, although the former cannot switch in safely, as it's susceptible to a burn from Scald, whereas the latter usually carries Facade. Ursaring carries Facade as well and gets a Speed boost from Quick Feet if it is burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Encore and Taunt</strong>: Grumpig, Misdreavus, Simipour, and Floatzel can Taunt Wailord, preventing it from using status moves, while Clefairy and Politoed can Encore Wailord and lock it into one move, making it easy to PP stall it.</p> <p><strong>Rest Users</strong>: Rest users such as Klang, Muk, and Zweilous can PP stall Wailord by using Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "StallLord": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Wailord to block status and scout switch-ins while letting it also PP stall moves. Aqua Ring gives Wailord recovery that can be utilized with Protect and Substitute. Protect gives Wailord a free turn of recovery, which can also be used to scout a foe's moves. Scald deals chip damage to a foe while also having the chance to burn it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Defense and Special Defense EVs maximize Wailord's overall bulk, allowing it to set up on as much of the metagame as possible, including resisted Choice-locked moves such as a Waterfall from Floatzel. Pressure allows Wailord to PP stall the majority of the metagame when set up, including threats such as Calm Mind Clefairy. Leftovers gives Wailord a bit of residual recovery, which, when paired with Aqua Ring, allows Wailord to lose no HP when using Substitute and Protect to PP stall a foe. A Bold nature is viable, although a Calm nature is generally preferred, as it allows Wailord to take special hits better, as most Water-types are special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wailord should be used as a bulky Water-type to absorb resisted or weaker neutral hits and as a nearly unbreakable PP stalling wall after it has set up. If you notice that Toxic Spikes can be easily set up without them being absorbed by a Poison-type foe, that can be an indicator that you can use Wailord as a wincon late-game. Wailord should avoid being inflicted with burn or poison, as it will be unable to survive for long periods of time if it loses HP every turn. Wailord should be preserved to PP stall a threat to stall teams, such as Duosion. Be wary of Boomburst Chatot and Infiltrator Jumpluff, both of which can hit through Substitute. Wailord needs entry hazards set up on the opponent's side of the field to be effective, as foes can switch around without much trouble otherwise, limiting its PP stalling abilities. Don't be afraid to use Wailord's natural bulk to switch in on threats it can wall, such as Camerupt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wailord requires support that generally only stall and semi-stall teams can provide. Toxic Spikes is almost mandatory to allow Wailord to stall out Pokemon with Substitute and Protect more easily, saving its own PP. Two layers of Toxic Spikes, which badly poison foes, are often better than one if your opponent has a Pokemon with reliable recovery, such as Milk Drink Gogoat. Roselia is the best option for a Toxic Spikes setter, as it has the bulk to set them up multiple times in a game and resists some of Wailord's weaknesses. Entry hazard removal is extremely valuable to keep Wailord healthy, as Toxic Spikes completely cripples it, and Stealth Rock and Spikes make it harder for Wailord to set up; thus, Rapid Spin users such as Avalugg and Armaldo and Defog users such as Vullaby and Vibrava make for great partners to Wailord. Misdreavus and other Ghost-types can be used as effective spinblockers. Cleric support is also extremely helpful for Wailord, giving it another chance to stall again if it is inflicted with status, such as an unfortunate Scald burn. Lickilicky and Audino have access to Heal Bell and are able to easily sponge special Grass- and Electric-type moves for Wailord. Toxic users help Wailord stall out more foes that are immune to Toxic Spikes. For instance, Gabite can use Toxic on many Defog users that switch into it, which allows Wailord to PP stall them more easily late-game. Wailord pairs well with Pokemon such as Roselia, Camerupt, and Klang, as they can take on Grass-type Pokemon with ease.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Camerupt stands out as a strong wallbreaker, able to break nearly every wall in PU regardless of its poor speed. Additionally, Camerupt's unique defensive typing makes it stand out as a premier switch-in to the Electric-types in PU. It also has access to Stealth Rock, can check numerous other threats with its unique typing, and hits hard even without investment. However, it is fairly frail even with defensive investment, weak to common Water- and Ground-type attackers, and extremely slow, making it easy to pressure offensively. It also faces competition from other Ground-types, most notably Stunfisk and Gabite, which are far bulkier; however, they lack Camerupt's neutrality to Ice, which allows Camerupt to take on Rotom-F far more easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs Camerupt has a few different options instead of Hidden Power Ice, including Sleep Talk to absorb Sleep Powders and Ancient Power to hit both Pelipper and Altaria in one slot, but no other options are capable of OHKOing Altaria, which is Camerupt's biggest annoyance. Yawn is an option for defensive Camerupt to force switches, but it is generally inferior to Roar. A physically defensive spread is possible to better handle foes such as Monferno and Pawniard, but this leaves Camerupt far weaker versus Rotom-F. Rock Polish sets can also be attempted, but they are generally too slow and frail to be useful, even at +2 Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Simipour and Floatzel can switch into Fire Blast or Stealth Rock and OHKO Camerupt with their STAB moves, although they don't particularly enjoy switching into Earth Power. Politoed and Lumineon can tank Camerupt's hits much more comfortably and threaten it with Scald, and Lumineon can also remove Camerupt's Stealth Rock with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Gabite and Golem can threaten Camerupt with Earthquake and switch into Fire Blast, but they must be wary of being burned by Lava Plume or hit with Earth Power. Vibrava totally walls Camerupt and can remove its entry hazards with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Altaria</strong>: Altaria totally walls all Camerupt sets lacking Hidden Power Ice and can cripple it with Toxic or do significant damage with Draco Meteor or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Camerupt's mediocre physical bulk, it can be OHKOed or 2HKOed by most of the physical attackers in the tier, leaving it unable to take on prominent threats such as Fraxure.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Because Camerupt lacks recovery, it can slowly be worn down by entry hazards, poison, and weaker attacks over longer games.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Eruption acts as a nuke, OHKOing or 2HKOing most of the tier including many Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Lumineon. Fire Blast is a secondary STAB attack for when Camerupt is too low on health for Eruption to be worth using. Earth Power acts as a secondary STAB attack to hit the few foes that can survive multiple Eruptions like Ninetales and Golem. Hidden Power Ice allows Camerupt to OHKO Altaria, Vibrava, and Gabite, but Hidden Power Electric is an option to OHKO Pelipper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs, a Modest nature, and Choice Specs allow Camerupt to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment lets Camerupt outspeed everything up to Vibrava. Solid Rock helps to take less damage from the few super effective hits Camerupt can survive, such as Scald from Chinchou or Lumineon without Stealth Rock damage. A slightly bulkier spread with 164 Speed and 88 HP EVs can be used to survive the aforementioned Scalds after Stealth Rock as well as a single Leaf Blade from Choice Band Leafeon while losing out on very few things other than Vibrava. A Timid nature can also be used to beat out neutral-natured Golem and Marowak, but at the cost of significant firepower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Camerupt should be brought in as frequently as possible early-game to break down the opposing team for its teammates to clean late-game. Camerupt pivots into defensive Pokemon lacking attacks that can do significant chip damage and weaken Eruption, so try double switching into Pokemon like Muk and defensive Mawile. Try to avoid switching into everything but weak defensive Pokemon like Vullaby, as taking damage early on can make Eruption a much less effective wallbreaking tool. Camerupt can beat some offensive Pokemon such as Zebstrika or Rapidash one-on-one, but doing so can leave it weakened and unable to take advantage of Eruption, so avoid doing this if Camerupt's wallbreaking is still necessary. If Camerupt is not facing a Flash Fire Pokemon like Ninetales, predictions are often unnecessary, as Eruption can 2HKO most of the tier. However, it is occasionally useful to catch Camerupt's few switch-ins with Hidden Power Ice or Earth Power. Once Camerupt has done its job wallbreaking, it can be used as death fodder unless specifically needed for something such as walling Zebstrika. It has very little late-game use due to its poor Speed and defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish support from Mr. Mime or Clefairy can be useful for getting Camerupt's health back up to be able to use Eruption effectively again. Stealth Rock support from Prinplup or Mawile helps Camerupt change some rolls into 2HKOs and keep pressure on Altaria. Entry hazard removers such as Swanna are also useful for keeping Camerupt at a high enough percentage to use Eruption most effectively. Sticky Web support helps patch up Camerupt's Speed by beating out everything up to Adamant Stoutland. Timid Camerupt can also beat Jolly Monferno and Gabite with Sticky Web up. Special sweepers like Regice and Floatzel benefit immensely from Camerupt's strong special wallbreaking. Pivots such as Pelipper and Mawile can be useful for getting Camerupt on the field more safely, and the former also provides entry hazard removal. Monferno is a good offensive partner, as the pair can wear down Water-types and Grumpig while shutting down Rotom-F, although the two Fire-types stack weaknesses. Misdreavus is another good offensive partner that can check Ground- and Water-types for Camerupt as well as functioning well on Sticky Web teams. Water-immune Pokemon such as Lumineon and Politoed are useful to check Pokemon like Floatzel that can force Camerupt out, as well as baiting in many passive Pokemon that Camerupt can take advantage of like Clefairy. Stoutland checks and other physically defensive Pokemon such as Mawile are also useful, as many physical wallbreakers can OHKO Camerupt without super effective moves.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Camerupt can use its free turns from checking Electric-types to set up Stealth Rock to cripple opposing teams. Fire Blast is Camerupt's preferred Fire-type attack, as it hits fairly hard even without investment, but Lava Plume can be used for better accuracy and an increased chance to burn. Earth Power provides excellent neutral coverage versus Pokemon that resist Fire such as Gabite and Simipour. Protect is helpful to give Camerupt extra Leftovers recovery and scout moves for Choice sets, but Toxic is a viable alternative to cripple bulkier foes such as Audino. Roar can also be used to phaze setup sweepers such as Clefairy and Huntail as well as rack up extra chip damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Solid Rock helps Camerupt take slightly reduced damage from super effective hits, although most strong super effective attacks will still OHKO regardless; nevertheless, it can help Camerupt take weaker attacks such as Stunfisk's Earth Power better. A specially defensive EV spread is used to better take on Rotom-F, although the HP investment is slightly reduced to take less damage from Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Camerupt should be used to block Volt Switches and take on opposing Electric-types and should be kept healthy as long as opponents still have an Electric-type to prevent them from gaining free momentum. However, be wary of Life Orb Rotom-F and Surf Raichu, which are still capable of breaking through Camerupt. Set up Stealth Rock as early as possible to wear down foes quickly. Avoid taking physical hits as much as possible, as Camerupt is very frail and takes significant damage from every physical attacker in the tier. Protect can be used for additional Leftovers recovery, but avoid overusing it, as it provides opponents a free turn to set up or switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Camerupt supports Pokemon weak to Electric that give the opponent free opportunities to use Volt Switch such as Vullaby and Politoed. It also helps wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Dodrio by providing Stealth Rock support to wear down foes. Water-type switch-ins such as Politoed and Roselia are required thanks to Camerupt's extreme weakness to those attacks, and Ground-type checks such as Leafeon and Tangela can help mitigate Camerupt's other weakness. Pawniard is a good offensive partner, as Camerupt weakens Gabite and Water-types on the switch in and checks Stunfisk, while Pawniard checks Choice item Normal-types for Camerupt.</p>"

A wide movepool gives it access to many tools like Thunder Wave for offensive teams and Taunt and Toxic for taking on stall. It also has access to Shadow Ball and Focus Blast, giving it coverage against other Psychic-types like Mr. Mime and Dark- and Steel-types like Pawniard and Probopass. Unfortunately, its less-than-stellar Defense leaves it with a weakness to physical attackers like Dodrio and Leafeon on top of being weak to Dark-type moves, which are fairly common. Grumpig also does not possess any reliable recovery, meaning it can get chipped down pretty easily and relies on Leftovers to gain any HP by itself. Nonetheless, due to the number of positive traits that Grumpig possesses, it isn't very hard to stick on teams, especially when looking at the number of Pokemon it can check regardless if it runs its offensive set for balanced and bulky offensive playstyles or specially defensive set for stall and semi-stall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs in tandem with Trick lets Grumpig cripple its switch-ins and provides a considerable boost in power, but it disallows Grumpig to switch between moves. Choice Scarf can be used, and while the added resistances and surprise factor can be useful, it is overall inferior to Choice Scarf Mr. Mime due to Grumpig's lower Speed. Energy Ball lets Grumpig hit Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types like Politoed, Stunfisk, and specially defensive Golem. Signal Beam makes it so Grumpig can hit both Psychic-types and Dark-types that may attempt to switch in, like Mightyena and Beheeyem. Power Gem can be used to hit Vullaby, Articuno, Crustle, and Ninetales harder and even secure the OHKO on Murkrow as it's switching into a predicted Psychic. Future Sight can force your opponent to switch in order to mitigate Future Sight's damage; however, fitting Future Sight on Grumpig's offensive set is quite difficult, as it would require removing one of its utility moves. A spread of 160 HP / 252 SpA / 96 Spe with a Modest Nature gives Grumpig more bulk and is just enough Speed to allow Grumpig to outspeed Adamant Pawniard. Psyshock does more damage to specially defensive Pokemon like Roselia and Cryogonal than Psychic and becomes even scarier when combined with Calm Mind. Heal Bell gives Grumpig the ability to heal itself and its team of status, which gives it a better match up versus Scald users. It is kind of hard to fit onto Grumpig's moveset, though, especially since it is already cramped.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Grumpig does not have the bulk to take on physically offensive Pokemon such as Dodrio and Leafeon. Most won't have much trouble KOing Grumpig after a little bit of chip damage, which is very easy to do, since Grumpig lacks reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Type Advantage</strong>: Grumpig's Psychic typing can be a defensive liability and makes it vulnerable to common Bug-, Dark- and Ghost-type attacks such as U-Turn, Shadow Ball, and Knock Off. Therefore, Grumpig can be easily pressured by Pokemon with access to these moves, like Leafeon, Misdreavus, and Ninjask.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit users like Stoutland, Dusknoir, Murkrow, Bouffalant, and Metang are all able to KO Grumpig, or if it's holding a Colbur Berry, weaken it considerably and force it to consume its Berry prematurely.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Grumpig lacks anything to heal itself with outside of Leftovers, so residual damage from entry hazards and status effects like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic from Gourgeist-XL and Lumineon get in the way of what Grumpig wants to accomplish.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Grumpig to set up with Calm Mind on more passive Pokemon and avoid status moves that would cripple it, such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Calm Mind makes Grumpig a potent setup sweeper and strengthens its wallbreaking capabilities, especially when combined with Substitute. Psyshock is used in order to beat other Calm Mind users such as Clefairy one-on-one. However, Psychic can also be used because it is slightly more powerful and helps with Curse Muk after it boosts. Focus Blast is used to hit the Dark- and Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Metang, that Grumpig's STAB move can't hit. Shadow Ball can be used over Substitute to beat other Psychic-types, but Substitute is generally better, as it gives Grumpig more chances to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs and Timid nature are used to outspeed Adamant Monferno and Stoutland while also providing one extra Speed point to account for base 70 Speed Pokemon like Politoed. The remaining EVs maximize Grumpig's damage output and still allow it to tank some hits and be a better check to Pokemon such as Monferno. Thick Fat lets Grumpig check Fire- and Ice-types well. Leftovers is used to make up for some of the health Grumpig loses after using Substitute. Colbur Berry can be used over Leftovers to lure Cacturne and Pawniard in, take a hit, and hit them with a Focus Blast, but this should only be used if you run Shadow Ball, because otherwise, the passive recovery from Leftovers is better with Substitute. An alternative EV spread with maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs can be used to outspeed Smeargle and use Substitute on its Spore or Dark Void; it also allows Grumpig to outspeed Modest Articuno and tie with other positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Arbok. However, it loses the bulk that allows it to set up Substitutes and check Fire- and Ice-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The ideal Pokemon for Grumpig to set up on are those that can't break its Substitute, such as Clefairy, Mr. Mime locked into Psychic, and Cryogonal. It should switch into these Pokemon to try to set up a Substitute, but be careful that they don't predict the switch and go for a status move such as Thunder Wave or Trick, crippling Grumpig. Grumpig threatens Pokemon such as Muk and forces them to switch out; this is another great time to set up Substitute. This Grumpig set should be used to wallbreak, as it annoys Pokemon like Clefairy and paves the way for cleaners such as Dodrio. However, it can also sweep bulkier teams late-game. Utilize Substitute to avoid status moves like Toxic, to scout for what move Pokemon like Choice Specs Beheeyem go for, and to dodge Sucker Punch from the likes of Cacturne and Pawniard. This set outspeeds Adamant Monferno, but watch out for Jolly U-turn Monferno, which can weaken Grumpig greatly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grumpig is best used on balance or bulky offense teams as a wallbreaker or a secondary sweeper that provides defensive utility with Thick Fat. Pursuit from Stoutland or Metang can trap, weaken, and KO the bulky Psychic-types, such as opposing Grumpig, that wall it. Entry hazard support, especially Toxic Spikes from the likes of Roselia, synergizes well with Substitute and helps Grumpig wallbreak. Grumpig's ability to check Fire- and Ice-types makes Pokemon that are weak to these types, such as Leafeon, Golem, and Regice, good teammates. Grumpig has to rely on winning mind games and hitting Focus Blast to take on Dark-types, so partners that beat them, such as Clefairy and Monferno, are much appreciated. Setup sweepers such as Grumpig and fast cleaners such as Dodrio and Chatot are great partners because Grumpig breaks down walls such as Metang and Mawile for them.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is a reliable STAB move that allows Grumpig to do heavy damage to Monferno and Poison-types like Muk. Focus Blast is for hitting Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types like Probopass, Pawniard, and Stoutland. Shadow Ball makes it so Grumpig can hit Psychic- and Ghost-types harder, including Gourgeist-XL, Mr. Mime, Drifblim, Metang, and opposing Grumpig. Taunt can be used to stop slower Pokemon like Duosion and Clefairy from setting up or walls like Audino and Gourgeist-XL from spreading status or recovering HP through a move. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down faster threats like Floatzel and Gorebyss, crippling them or even allowing Grumpig to pick them off more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment gives Grumpig more of an offensive presence. 176 Speed with a Timid nature is just enough to let it outspeed Adamant Monferno and Stoutland, while also providing one extra Speed point to account for base 70 Speed Pokemon like Politoed. The rest is thrown into HP to give Grumpig a little more bulk. Colbur Berry allows Grumpig to check many more threats than it can otherwise, like Sucker Punch Arbok, Pawniard, and Mightyena, while also preventing it from getting stomped on by Pursuit and Knock Off users. Note that Colbur Berry doesn't stop Pokemon with Dark-type coverage from hitting super hard, with some examples being Leafeon, Dodrio, and Kingler. Leftovers provides passive recovery, allowing Grumpig to take more hits for its teammates. Thick Fat grants Grumpig the ability to come in on Fire- and Ice-type attacks with ease.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Grumpig into predicted Ice- and Fire-type attacks like Articuno's Freeze-Dry and Ninetales's Fire Blast; however, Grumpig should be careful when switching into physically offensive Fire-types like Monferno and mixed Simisear, as they are prime examples of Pokemon that are able to exploit Grumpig's lower Defense stat. Additionally, Grumpig should be extremely cautious of Pursuit trappers like Bouffalant and Metang that may be coming in, so either go for a Focus Blast when they are weakened enough to be picked off or pull a double switch when you predict them to come in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Leafeon, Roselia, Sawsbuck, and Tangela like Grumpig's ability to check special Fire- and Ice-types. Roselia also likes having Psychic-types checked. Physically defensive Pokemon synergize well with Grumpig, since they can take hits for Grumpig that it doesn't usually want to deal with; some examples for partners are Metang and Gabite. Audino can keep Grumpig healthy by passing it Wishes, while Grumpig helps to check Fighting-types that trouble Audino. Special sweepers like Simipour and Regice appreciate Grumpig's ability to chip down the opposing team and stop supportive Pokemon that may try to throw status at them. Slower wallbreakers like Stoutland, Simisage, and Relicanth appreciate the Thunder Wave support, as it allows them to outspeed threats they couldn't before. Vullaby is a nuisance for Grumpig, so teammates that can deal with it like Rotom-F and Zebstrika benefit Grumpig a lot. Golem is a great partner for Grumpig on balanced teams; Golem can take on a large number of physical attackers for Grumpig like Ninjask and Dodrio, while in return, Grumpig can check Monferno. Grumpig can also switch into specially based Ice- and Fighting-type moves on Golem's behalf like Rotom-F's Blizzard, Regice's Ice Beam, and Mr. Mime's Focus Blast.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic prevents Grumpig from being completely passive and provides a nice STAB move to deal with Fighting-types. Focus Blast nails Rock-, Steel-, and Dark-types like Probopass and Pawniard, stopping them from taking full advantage of Grumpig. Thunder Wave slows down faster offensive Pokemon like Simisage and Jumpluff. Toxic, on the other hand, puts a timer on bulky Pokemon that may try to stay in for a while, such as Audino and Cryogonal. Protect works to scout Choice-locked Pokemon and allow Grumpig to gain a little bit of Leftovers recovery. Taunt mainly is used for stopping slower Pokemon from using entry hazards, like Spikes from Quilladin and Stealth Rock from Camerupt, Grumpig from getting hit by Toxic, and slow setup sweepers like Munchlax and Clefairy. It can also prevent opposing Pokemon from recovering HP via moves like Roost and Synthesis. Whirlwind forces your foe to switch, which can both save your team against a setup sweeper and spread chip damage via entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Grumpig a little more longevity. 36 Defense EVs let Grumpig avoid the OHKO from a +2 Adamant Monferno after Stealth Rock. Maximum HP and 224 Special Defense EVs alongside a Calm nature boost Grumpig's specially defensive capabilities. Thick Fat acts as extra set of resistances to Fire- and Ice-type moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Grumpig's unique set of resistances to pivot into Fire-, Ice-, and Psychic-types like Ninetales, Cryogonal, and Mr. Mime. Grumpig should try to stay away from physical attackers, as its Defense stat isn't the best, which means having to take a heavy blow will hinder its ability to pivot into things it is meant to check. Try to avoid Pokemon with access to Pursuit like Murkrow, Bouffalant, and Metang. It is best to either double switch before they have the opportunity to use Pursuit or use Thunder Wave and follow up with an attack. Use Protect as much as possible to gain more Leftovers recovery, stack up more Toxic damage on your foe, and scout for Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Band Stoutland and Choice Scarf Rotom-F, but do not use it so often that it gives your opponent the opportunity to set up with a sweeper or lay entry hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grumpig fits onto defensively inclined builds, since its resistances and utility can provide a lot to a team. Physically defensive partners complement Grumpig's Special Defense, with examples being Gourgeist-XL, Relicanth, Stunfisk, and Dusclops. Grumpig appreciates cleric support due to how fast it can be worn down. Audino can provide Wish support to keep Grumpig's HP up, and Altaria can provide Heal Bell support in case Grumpig ever gets afflicted with a status effect. Grumpig struggles with Dark-types, so using Pokemon that can remove them is very beneficial. For example, Monferno can deal with Mightyena and Pawniard, while Rock-types like Probopass and Golem can handle Murkrow.</p>"

Spinda displays his gifted voice by slurring the words to a song, which usually ends up in the audience falling asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice is the uniform item for all Spinda, as it is a symbol of their despair and nights at the bar, not to mention that it tastes delicious.

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>Cacturne's incredible offensive stats and large movepool make it a top wallbreaker in the PU metagame. Unlike most other wallbreakers, it has access to a very strong priority move in Sucker Punch, making it difficult to revenge kill and allowing it to threaten offensive teams. Cacturne also has the ability to utilize both specially and physically based sets, which share no counters, while a Swords Dance set can easily sweep in the late-game. Unfortunately, defensive answers to Cacturne like Clefairy, Vullaby, and Muk are fairly common, though only Muk can reliably counter both sets, whereas Monferno, the best offensive Cacturne check, is very common and can act as a potential switch-in. Lastly, Cacturne's low Speed, poor bulk, and bad defensive typing mean it is overly reliant on Sucker Punch, which can be taken advantage of with status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Encore.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically based mixed set with Seed Bomb and Superpower over Energy Ball and Focus Blast can lure in specially defensive checks like Clefairy and lets Sucker Punch hit harder but is easier to wall with Pokemon such as Vullaby and Mawile. Cacturne can use a lead Spikes set with utility moves like Destiny Bond and Bullet Seed to bypass Golem's Sturdy; however, Smeargle and Venipede do that better due to their access to Spore and Speed Boost, respectively. A Nasty Plot set can be used to destroy more defensive teams, but the loss of Sucker Punch makes it useless against offensive ones. Thunder Punch can be used over Superpower on the Swords Dance set to KO Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage at +2, but Superpower provides wider coverage. Spikes can be used over Focus Blast on the wallbreaking set, though Cacturne is then unable to deal with many Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Monferno</strong>: Monferno is the best answer to Cacturne, as it can easily switch into any of its STAB moves and then OHKO it with Mach Punch without worrying about Sucker Punch. However, Monferno is 2HKOed by any Fighting coverage.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Utility</strong>: Fast offensive Pokemon with ways to get around Sucker Punch really trouble Cacturne. Will-O-Wisp users, such as Rotom-F and Rapidash, and Substitute users, such as Ninetales and Articuno, can avoid Sucker Punch and OHKO Cacturne the next turn with their STAB moves. Pawniard and Zweilous can both outspeed and take even a boosted Sucker Punch before revenge killing Cacturne.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Muk, Roselia, and specially defensive Clefairy completely wall Cacturne's special sets, whereas Vullaby, Gourgeist, and Mawile can easily counter its physical sets. Other bulky Pokemon such as Tangela and Altaria can take a neutral attack and cripple Cacturne with status or super effective coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Energy Ball is Cacturne's strongest STAB move, capable of 2HKOing Pokemon that resist it, such as Mawile, and Dark Pulse provides a secondary STAB move to hit Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Fire- and Steel-types hard. Alongside its STAB moves, Focus Blast provides Cacturne with perfect neutral coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Monferno, Vullaby, and Probopass for more damage. Lastly, Sucker Punch provides Cacturne with priority to revenge kill frail, faster threats such as Floatzel and Zebstrika.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Cacturne to outspeed threats such as Golem and Mawile, and 252 Special Attack EVs with a positive nature maximize its damage output. A Rash nature is used so Sucker Punch isn't weakened, and Life Orb further increases Cacturne's power. Water Absorb allows Cacturne to check Choice-locked or defensive Water-types such as Floatzel and Chinchou, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cacturne should be used early-game as a wallbreaker or potentially as a revenge killer. It should come in after a KO, on a predicted status move, or on a double switch. Try not, however, to switch it on a resisted attack, as it is frail and many Pokemon carry coverage moves that can KO it. Once Cacturne has been switched in, it should be free to fire off attacks, though if the opponent has a counter such as Clefairy, it may be best to double switch out. When trying to revenge kill Pokemon with Sucker Punch, be careful of Will-O-Wisp users such as Rapidash and Rotom-S, and keep in mind it can provide a free switch in for a Pokemon that can deal with Cacturne.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cacturne works best on offensive teams, with entry hazards to wear down the foe and cleaners to make use of Cacturne's wallbreaking. Golem and Smeargle provide invaluable entry hazard support, with the former also checking specially defensive Clefairy and Muk and the latter also providing Spikes. Strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Rapidash also work well in order to pressure special walls, which annoy Cacturne, while Cacturne can KO most of their counters. Though Cacturne can revenge kill faster Pokemon with Sucker Punch, it is essential to run fast Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Choice Scarf users like Mr. Mime to more reliably revenge kill and possibly clean up late-game. Volt Switch or U-turn users such as Rotom-F and Monferno provide Cacturne with a safe entry to the battlefield, while Fire-type checks such as Lumineon and Altaria can take on some of Cacturne's major checks, most notably Monferno. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Monferno and Shell Smash Huntail also appreciate Cacturne's ability to wallbreak.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Cacturne's Attack, allowing it to sweep late-game. Sucker Punch allows Cacturne to KO faster Pokemon, whereas Seed Bomb provides Cacturne with a more reliable STAB move to hit slower Pokemon. Superpower provides coverage against Pokemon such as Vullaby and Mawile that resist its STAB moves and deals more damage to Steel- and Normal-types such as Pawniard and Bouffalant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with a Life Orb and an Adamant nature provide Cacturne with enough Attack to sweep, and 252 Speed EVs let it outspeed slower Pokemon such as Pelipper and Golem. Water Absorb gives Cacturne an immunity to Scald, allowing it to check Water-types like Prinplup.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Cacturne should be used late-game, when the opponent's team has been weakened and Cacturne's counters have been removed. Cacturne should avoid taking damage by entering the battle via Volt Switch or U-turn or after its teammate has been KOed, and it should try to set up on Pokemon it forces out, such as Politoed, Metang, and Stunfisk. When it has set up, be careful of Pokemon that can play around Sucker Punch, such as Rapidash, which can use Will-O-Wisp, and Ninetales, which can set up a Substitute. Keep in mind that Cacturne can be useful even without setting up, possibly acting as a revenge killer with Sucker Punch. If there is a Monferno on the opposing team, it is best to use Superpower on a predicted switch to weaken Monferno, as it can OHKO Cacturne with Mach Punch before Cacturne could possibly use Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cacturne is best used on offensive teams, which can provide necessary wallbreaking and entry hazard support to allow Cacturne to sweep. Entry hazard support from Stealth Rock and Spikes users such as Golem, Probopass, and Smeargle is crucial in wearing down the opposing offensive threats to put them in the KO range of Sucker Punch. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Simipour are important in order to weaken the opponent's defensive tanks. Choice Band Leafeon can Knock Off Vullaby's Eviolite, lure and KO Monferno, and weaken Mawile, but it shares many weaknesses with Cacturne. Other Vullaby and Monferno lures, such as Calm Mind Grumpig and Simisear, are also greatly appreciated.</p>"

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Capable of pulling off both offensive and defensive sets, Altaria is a very versatile Pokemon in the PU metagame. Useful resistances to Grass- and Fire-type attacks allow it to naturally check many threatening attackers; in particular, it is the best offensive check to Monferno available. Its unpredictability makes up for its somewhat lacking offensive stats, and Altaria is the only Dragon-type that can viably run a special attacking set. In addition, it is very easy to fit onto teams and doesn't face much competition; while Fraxure is a more powerful Dragon Dance sweeper, Altaria can make more use of its bulk, resistances, Natural Cure, and access to Roost.</p> <p>However, Altaria's mediocre base 70 / 70 offenses prevent it from doing too much damage to many teams, and its below average Speed tier, when unboosted, leaves it outsped by common offensive threats such as Floatzel, Mr. Mime, and the elemental monkeys; in addition, most Choice Scarf users outspeed Altaria even after a Dragon Dance. Furthermore, its Stealth Rock weakness hinders its ability to check some foes, such as Monferno carrying U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set can be used to handle Ninetales and some other special attackers. Altaria can also use Agility on its special attacking set, though its lack of power means that it will likely not be able to fully sweep a team. Iron Tail can be used to surprise Clefairy, which Altaria lures in, but it isn't very common. Roar can be used on the physically defensive set if Heal Bell isn't needed. Rest can be used over on any set besides Dragon Dance, as with Natural Cure, Altaria will be fully healthy upon switching in again; however, this grants free turns to potentially dangerous foes. Choice Specs is a viable alternative to the specially attacking set, but without reliable recovery and with a weakness to Stealth Rock, it struggles to check the usual Pokemon. Power Swap can also be used with Draco Meteor to cancel out its negative effect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Ice-types such as Articuno and Regice can take hits from Altaria thanks to their great special bulk and retaliate with an OHKO or set up, while Rotom-F can outspeed Altaria. Altaria's Water resistance is almost useless, as Water-types all carry Ice-type coverage to KO it. In addition, Hidden Power Ice from foes like Tangela can catch Altaria off guard.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefairy hard counters Altaria, while Mr. Mime can stomach a +1 Earthquake and even commonly runs Choice Scarf to outspeed Altaria after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Earthquake deal heavy damage to Pawniard and Metang, the two can potentially stop mono-attacking sets with Swords Dance and Toxic, respectively.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor, backed by STAB and Life Orb, is Altaria's strongest move and can severely dent a large portion of the tier. Fire Blast hits Steel-types hard, OHKOing Pawniard and 2HKOing Metang and Klang. It also lets Altaria 2HKO bulky Roselia after Stealth Rock damage and OHKO offensive Grass-types without dropping its Special Attack. Altaria needs Roost to stay healthy after taking Stealth Rock damage, Life Orb recoil, and hits from Pokemon such as Monferno that it can switch in on. Toxic is Altaria's most useful fourth move, wearing down bulkier Pokemon such as Audino, Politoed, and Stunfisk. Earthquake grants Altaria a notable 2HKO on Probopass and Muk; it also aids in wearing down Stunfisk after a Draco Meteor and 2HKOes Pawniard if Altaria is at -2. Finally, Dragon Pulse can be used a secondary STAB option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EVs, Altaria's offensive capabilities are simply maximized by heightening its Special Attack and Speed. Life Orb boosts Altaria's power even further, granting it KOs on numerous offensive Pokemon with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast. A Modest nature lets Altaria hit noticeably harder, securing an OHKO on offensive Arbok, for instance. A Timid nature allows Altaria to outspeed the likes of neutral-natured Stoutland, Monferno, and Gabite. With Natural Cure, Altaria doesn't need to worry much about switching into moves like Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Cloud Nine is feasible to cancel out Swift Swim, Sand Rush, and Chlorophyll.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Altaria should use its typing and bulk to switch into common Pokemon it can check, including Monferno, Rapidash, and Leafeon. Because Steel-types such as Metang are likely to switch directly into Altaria, it should attempt to hit them with Fire Blast on the switch, as the Special Attack drops from using Draco Meteor will render it unable to 2HKO them. Altaria can use Toxic on its checks early-game to wear them down and make it more difficult for them to safely switch into Draco Meteor. Avoid using Draco Meteor if sweepers such as Gorebyss and Regice can use -2 Altaria as setup fodder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roselia is an ideal teammate for Altaria; its Spikes support greatly helps wear down Altaria's checks, and it can handle the fast Electric- and Water-types that threaten Altaria. Pawniard is an excellent partner as well, pressuring the special walls that can switch into Altaria and threatening its offensive checks with Sucker Punch. While not completely necessary, entry hazard removal from Vullaby or Swanna helps Altaria switch in and out of the field more freely; however, these Pokemon may stack weaknesses to attackers like Zebstrika and Floatzel. Partners like Focus Sash Kadabra and Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F can check sweepers that could potentially take advantage of Altaria after a Draco Meteor. Similarly, threatening Ice-types such as Rotom-F, Articuno, and Regice can come in for free after Altaria gets a kill, so teammates that can sponge their attacks, such as Grumpig and Audino, are needed.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set focuses on Altaria's sweeping capabilities with Dragon Dance. Dragon Claw is a decently powerful, reliable STAB move that provides consistent damage. Earthquake hits Steel-types super effectively. Roost keeps Altaria healthy as it switches into Stealth Rock and sets up. Outrage can be used for a much more powerful STAB move, but it locks Altaria in, which can be detrimental in the presence of Steel-types or if Altaria hasn't boosted enough to KO a certain foe.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 192 Speed EVs lets Altaria outspeed Zebstrika after a Dragon Dance. Altaria's Attack is maximized with an Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs, with the rest of the investment being placed into HP to slightly increase its bulk. Natural Cure lets Altaria heal itself of status if it's inflicted with one by something like Stunfisk, Kadabra, or Gourgeist. Yache Berry helps Altaria take one Ice-type move to allow it to set up a necessary Dragon Dance against a foe like Floatzel or Zebstrika. On the other hand, Leftovers helps Altaria set up more comfortably against Pokemon that try to wear it down with weaker attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Altaria is relatively weak, it should be saved until the late-game to use Dragon Dance as many times as possible before attacking; Altaria usually needs at least two boosts to KO even frail Pokemon without significant prior damage. However, Altaria can also be utilized mid-game as a check to threats like Monferno and Leafeon, recovering off the damage taken as needed. Physically defensive walls, especially Clefairy, must be eliminated before Altaria attempts to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Bouffalant and Choice Band Leafeon can help weaken or KO the defensive Pokemon that trouble Altaria. Spikes support from Roselia, Quilladin, or Venipede makes it significantly easier for Altaria to sweep; for example, with Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, Altaria only needs one boost to KO frailer offensive Pokemon such as Floatzel and Mr. Mime. Healing Wish support from Mr. Mime is also appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Altaria's Attack and Speed, turning it into a bulky setup sweeper. Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB attack that has great neutral coverage with few foes resisting it. Roost keeps Altaria healthy as it sets up and prevents it from being worn down too easily. Cotton Guard boosts Altaria's Defense, allowing it to set up easily on even the strongest of physical attackers. Heal Bell can be used to cure Altaria and its teammates of any status ailment without having to switch out; Refresh is also usable and comes with more PP. Substitute lets Altaria set up without fear against more passive foes such as Stunfisk and Hex Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs and nature allow Altaria to outspeed Zebstrika after one Dragon Dance while maximizing Altaria's special bulk in order for it to shrug off hits from foes such as Kadabra and Ninetales. Natural Cure is Altaria's most useful ability, providing it with some safety if it happens to be inflicted by status. Leftovers is the best option for this set to maximize Altaria's longevity. The investment can be placed into Defense if Altaria forgoes Cotton Guard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Altaria can be used primarily as a check to offensive threats such as Simisage and Leafeon. If Altaria is going for a sweep, it needs significant prior damage on both offensive and defensive Pokemon. Mr. Mime and Clefairy must be eliminated for Altaria to sweep. Steel-types, in addition to these uncommon Fairy-types, should be eliminated for Altaria to sweep more easily, although it can outlast Pawniard and Metang lacking Toxic with Cotton Guard. However, Altaria can use several defensive Pokemon as setup fodder, including Stunfisk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Altaria works well on balanced teams as a defensive pivot and check to many common threats that also doubles as a bulky setup sweeper. Magnet Pull Probopass can trap the Steel-types that trouble Altaria and can check Clefairy and Mr. Mime. Audino complements Altaria well, checking the Water-types and other wallbreakers that threaten Altaria while Altaria can switch into the likes of Monferno. Entry hazard support, especially Spikes and Toxic Spikes, can aid in putting significant pressure on the opponent as Altaria sets up.</p>"

  "Seviper": {
    "overview": "<p>Seviper has a niche as a mixed attacker with workable offensive stats. With decent typing defensively and offensively and a huge movepool, including Sludge Wave, Flamethrower, and even Giga Drain, Seviper is a nightmare against slower teams. On the other hand, its mediocre defensive stats make it difficult to bring in, even against resisted moves. On top of that, Seviper's lackluster speed makes it practically dead weight versus offensive teams, as it is forced out by pretty much anything faster.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully physical set consisting of Poison Jab, Aqua Tail, Sucker Punch, and Earthquake allows Seviper to hit hard while retaining similar coverage. Aqua Tail does heavy damage to Ground-types like Golem, while Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Probopass and Metang. Knock Off could also be used to cripple switch-ins, especially Eviolite holders such as Duosion. A Choice Scarf set outruns the majority of the unboosted tier, but it is fairly weak. On such a set, Switcheroo could be utilized to shut down an Eviolite holder or a bulkier Pokemon in general. Lastly, Glare is an option that can paralyze opposing Pokemon, including Ground-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Most Ground-types such as Stunfisk can tank a Giga Drain and OHKO with a STAB Ground-type move. Golem can survive a Giga Drain with Sturdy and OHKO back with Earthquake, Vibrava completely walls it, and many other Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Camerupt can check it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Audino, Bouffalant, Regice, and Grumpig can switch into most of Seviper's moves and can threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Seviper's subpar Speed and poor defenses, it is easily revenge killed by opposing Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime and Rotom-F. However, these should be wary of switching into the wrong move.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Both Misdreavus and Dusknoir shrug off Seviper's Poison-type STAB moves and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp to weaken its Sucker Punch, while Drifblim can set up Substitutes on it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Colbur Berry Grumpig is a good check to Seviper, as it can survive both a Sucker Punch and a Sludge Wave and KO back with Psychic. Mr. Mime and Metang can also KO, but they can't switch into most of Seviper's moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Wave deals big damage to almost anything that doesn't resist it. Giga Drain is an excellent coverage move, hitting bulky Ground- and Water-types, such as Golem and Relicanth. Flamethrower helps Seviper match up better against Steel-types and other Pokemon weak to Fire, OHKOing Pawniard and 2HKOing Metang and Roselia. Earthquake could be used over Flamethrower to OHKO Probopass and to nail Arbok and Muk. Sucker Punch rounds off this set as Seviper's strongest priority move, making up for its lackluster Speed and finishing off weakened foes or anything faster than it in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Seviper's wallbreaking potential. A Rash nature is used to fully power up Seviper's special attacks without compromising its physical power or Speed. The 216 EVs in Speed let it outpace Pawniard, with the rest poured into Attack to strengthen Earthquake and Sucker Punch. Due to Infiltrator being incompatible with Sucker Punch, Shed Skin is the preferred ability, helping Seviper shrug off status. Life Orb boosts Seviper's power even more but wears it down very quickly at the same time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Seviper is extremely frail, bringing it in against even resisted moves is ill advised. However, you can bring Seviper in against bulkier or weaker Pokemon, as its typing allows it to shrug off weaker moves such as Clefairy's Moonblast and Gourgeist's Seed Bomb. It is definitely okay to sacrifice Seviper if it means getting crucial damage off on an offensive threat, such as Kadabra. Make sure to utilize Seviper against more defensively oriented teams, as its immunity to poison along with Shed Skin makes it easier to bring in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seviper is best utilized on an offensive team, as it is great at breaking down opposing defensive cores that its teammates may struggle with. Jumpluff in particular is a stellar partner for Seviper, as the former wears down bulky Ground-types such as Stunfisk. Jumpluff can also weaken Roselia and Relicanth, two defensive and offensive threats that can tank any of Seviper's moves from full health. Other Grass-types in general are great teammates for Seviper, as they can switch into any Ground move for it; some examples are Tangela and Leafeon. Seviper also appreciates any form of speed control, so Sticky Web setters and Thunder Wave users such as Leavanny and Clefairy make good teammates. A Pursuit trapper also pairs well with Seviper, removing Ghost-types and Psychic-types such as Misdreavus and Kadabra, respectively. Speaking of Misdreavus, Seviper appreciates teammates than can effectively remove it without being crippled, like Ninetales and Rapidash.</p>"

  "Whiscash": {
    "overview": "<p>Whiscash is a pretty mediocre Pokemon despite having a great Water / Ground typing that gives it only one weakness in Grass along with an immunity to Electric-type attacks. Whiscash also has access to Dragon Dance, which gives the niche of a decent physical sweeper. However, outside of its HP, all of Whiscash's stats are mediocre at best. Also, Whiscash's low Speed stat means that even after a Dragon Dance, it can be revenge killed by faster Pokemon or Choice Scarf users, and it needs a lot of team support, as its average Attack keeps it from breaking through bulkier Pokemon. Whiscash is also complete setup bait for Grass-types such as Roselia and Tangela which can take any of its attacks with relative ease. Whiscash is also generally outclassed as a Water-type sweeper by Huntail and as a Dragon Dance sweeper by Fraxure.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bounce can hit Grass-types for super effective damage, but it takes a turn to use and can be dealt with by using Protect or switching to a Flying-type resist. Zen Headbutt can hit Roselia, but Earthquake does just as much damage to it. Toxic can wear down common switch-ins to Whiscash such as Leafeon and Tangela. A Choice Specs set with Hydro Pump, Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Electric with a Modest nature can be used, but is outclassed by Floatzel, which has higher Speed and access to Switcheroo. Substitute allows Whiscash to dodge status conditions and Sucker Punch while making it easier for it to set up Dragon Dance. A bulkier set with Rest + Hydration can be used to set up Dragon Dance easier while recovering from status with rain support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Jumpluff can all survive a hit from Whiscash and KO it in return with their STAB moves, but they must be wary if Whiscash runs Ice Beam. Quilladin can tank a Waterfall or Earthquake and either heal off any damage with Synthesis, proceed to set up Spikes, or outright OHKO Whiscash with Wood Hammer. Gogoat can also take a Life Orb-boosted Waterfall or Earthquake and can shrug off Ice Beam and OHKO Whiscash with Horn Leech or set up with Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Even after a Dragon Dance, Whiscash is still slow, so Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Whiscash are problematic. Examples include Floatzel and Zebstrika. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Sawsbuck, Rotom-F, and Mr. Mime can outspeed and either KO Whiscash or weaken it where it can't effectively sweep.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good physical bulk such as defensive Vullaby and Avalugg can easily handle Whiscash if it isn't running Stone Edge; the former could either possibly wear down Whiscash with Foul Play or Roost off any damage, and the latter can 2HKO Whiscash with Avalanche, cripple it with Toxic, or phaze it with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn lowers Whiscash's Attack and takes away its function as a physical sweeper whereas Toxic Spikes wear down Whiscash over time, as it loses health each turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance increases Whiscash's Attack and Speed. Earthquake is Whiscash's strongest move, hitting Water-types that resist Waterfall such as Politoed and Simipour. Waterfall is Whiscash's primary STAB move, hitting for solid damage with a chance to make the foe flinch. Stone Edge provides great coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Pelipper, which resists Waterfall and is immune to Earthquake. Ice Beam, however, can be used to surprise opposing Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangela, which resist Whiscash's dual STAB attacks, for super effective damage off of their lower Special Defense.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs provide Whiscash with maximum damage output. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Whiscash to outspeed threats such as maximum Speed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Mightyena before a Dragon Dance while outspeeding Jolly Purugly and everything below that after a Dragon Dance. If you're running Ice Beam, a Naive nature is preferred to increase the damage Ice Beam can do while being able to 2HKO Tangela and Gourgeist-XL. Life Orb increases the power of all of Whiscash's attacks at the cost of some health. Hydration is the best of Whiscash's abilities, as while it might seem situational, having status removed when it's raining greatly benefits Whiscash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Whiscash is best used late-game when its checks and counters are eliminated or weak enough to the point where Whiscash can clean up for itself. Set up Dragon Dance against foes that Whiscash can force out such as Rapidash and Probopass. Be mindful of Whiscash's health, as Life Orb wears it down with each attack, and being burned or poisoned will either lower its Attack or limit how long Whiscash can sweep, respectively. Be sure to get rid of or weaken, faster Pokemon or Choice Scarf users, as Whiscash is still slow even after a Dragon Dance. Avoid switching Whiscash into strong attacks due to its subpar defenses. Whiscash should come in when a teammate has fainted or from a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Be mindful of switching Whiscash into a predicted Electric-type attack, as Pokemon such as Raichu and Zebstrika can predict it switching in and either use Grass Knot or Hidden Power Grass, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Whiscash appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roselia, Venipede, Golem, and Probopass to wear down opposing foes; netting an OHKO Floatzel after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock damage with Earthquake. Roselia resists Grass-type attacks and can handle Grass-types with Sludge Bomb. Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Rapidash, Dodrio, and Rotom-F deal with troublesome Grass-types that Whiscash has trouble getting past while Whiscash handles Rock-types for them in return. Wallbreakers such as Ursaring and Beheeyem can break down the opponent's team, making it easier for Whiscash to sweep. Ice Beam variants of Basculin can lure in and weaken or take out Grass-types. Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Torkoal, Armaldo, and Avalugg benefits Whiscash, as it is affected by all forms of entry hazards.</p>"

  "Armaldo": {
    "overview": "<p>Armaldo sets itself apart from other Pokemon in the PU metagame with its access to Rapid Spin. It also has a very high base 125 Attack and access to Knock Off, allowing it to cripple spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir. On top of that, Armaldo has access to Swift Swim, making it a threatening Swords Dance sweeper in rain. However, Armaldo's Rock / Bug typing leaves it vulnerable to common attacking types such as Water and Rock, although it does allow it to check Normal-types such as Stoutland and Ursaring. It is also very slow, making it easy for faster Pokemon such as Floatzel to take advantage of. Armaldo lacks the space in its moveslot to fit moves such as Toxic, Aqua Tail, and Stealth Rock, which holds it back from having extra utility. Armaldo is also vulnerable to every form of entry hazards, making it difficult for it to consistently remove them with Rapid Spin, which is a pretty big flaw for a Pokemon that is supposed to remove entry hazards as reliably as possible.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish is another option for Armaldo that turns it into a threatening sweeper without the need for Swift Swim. Rock Blast is more accurate than Stone Edge and still allows Armaldo to beat Sturdy and Focus Sash users. A fully offensive set with Rapid Spin can be used, although Armaldo lacks the Speed to take on most of the tier and would lose out on a massive amount of bulk. Passho Berry is an option on Rapid Spin Armaldo that allows it to take a single hit from Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour. A fully defensive spread of maximum HP and Defense EVs can be used to better check Pokemon such as Ursaring, though it makes Armaldo more passive and causes it to be outsped by Pokemon such as Roselia. Toxic is an option that allows Armaldo to catch bulkier Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Stunfisk upon switching in. Aqua Tail can be used on Armaldo's Swift Swim set in order to take on Golem and Stunfisk more effectively, although Armaldo then struggles with Steel-types such as Pawniard. Finally, although it may seem appealing, Assault Vest is a terrible item on Armaldo because it needs the recovery Leftovers provides in order to be able to switch in on entry hazards multiple times in a game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: While offensive Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour can't effectively switch into Armaldo, they can easily take advantage of Armaldo's low Speed and OHKO it with Hydro Pump. Bulkier Water-types such as Politoed can also switch into Armaldo and KO it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Burn and poison make Armaldo easy to wear down, especially with Stealth Rock in play, with the former also significantly lowering its Attack stat and the latter putting Armaldo on a timer. Armaldo also has trouble switching into Pokemon such as Monferno multiple times due to its lack of recovery. Furthermore, its high vulnerability to the hazards it wants to remove also give Armaldo a difficult time doing its job.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Ghost-types such as Misdreavus don't enjoy switching into Knock Off, they can keep Armaldo from using Rapid Spin, which is its main niche.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is Armaldo's strongest STAB move and thus is its most spammable move. It is also helpful for beating Sturdy and Focus Sash leads such as Whirlipede, which it can bring down to 1% HP and finish it off with Rapid Spin, removing any existing entry hazards. Knock Off allows Armaldo to cripple Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL that attempt to prevent Armaldo from using Rapid Spin. Earthquake allows Armaldo to take on Steel- and Rock-types such as Probopass and Golem, which take little damage from Stone Edge and Knock Off. Rapid Spin is Armaldo's main selling point, as it allows it to remove entry hazards from its side of the field.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Armaldo passive recovery, which is helpful especially if it switches into entry hazards multiple times to Rapid Spin. Maximum HP EVs maximize Armaldo's overall bulk while allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock five times when at full health, while 164 Speed EVs allow Armaldo to outspeed uninvested Pokemon with base 65 Speed, most notably Roselia. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to allow Armaldo to deal as much damage to its targets as possible; an Adamant nature is used to further boost its Attack. Battle Armor is the preferred ability, as Swift Swim isn't very useful if Armaldo isn't being used on a rain team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opponent has a Ghost-type and has entry hazards on Armaldo's side of the field, Knock Off should be used to cripple the incoming Ghost-type, allowing Armaldo to freely Rapid Spin later in the game. Thanks to Armaldo's Rock / Bug typing, it can be switched into physical Normal-types such as Stoutland and Ursaring easily. Once Armaldo is in against a Pokemon it has no trouble taking on, such as Stoutland or Roselia, it should take advantage of the situation and use Rapid Spin to get rid of entry hazards. If entry hazards are desperately needed to be removed, Armaldo can be sacrificed in order to get a Rapid Spin off. If the opponent has an item-reliant Pokemon such as Clefairy or Roselia, Armaldo can use Knock Off to cripple these Pokemon and make it easier for teammates to KO them later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Murkrow and Ninetales appreciate Armaldo's ability to remove the hazards in order for them not to be worn down as quickly. Armaldo appreciates Pursuit trappers such as Bouffalant, Pawniard, and Stoutland to get rid of Ghost-types, making it easier to Rapid Spin. Roselia synergizes very well with Armaldo, as it has no trouble switching into Scald or taking on Rock-types that threaten Armaldo. Other Pokemon that resist Water-type moves such as Politoed and Gogoat are helpful in taking pressure off of Armaldo once Water-types such as Simipour get a free switch in.</p>"
      },
      "Swift Swim": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Armaldo's Attack stat, making it a threatening sweeper, especially when rain is active. Stone Edge is Armaldo's most powerful attack, KOing most foes that don't resist it at +2. Earthquake allows Armaldo to take on Steel- and Rock-types, such as Golem and Pawniard, that switch into Stone Edge. Rain-boosted Aqua Jet is great for picking off weakened foes and faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Mr. Mime. X-Scissor is another option that allows Armaldo to take on bulky Grass-types such as Tangela and Quilladin, as well as bulkier Psychic-types such as Duosion and Solrock, although without Aqua Jet, Armaldo is much easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swift Swim doubles Armaldo's Speed when rain is active, making it a threatening sweeper. Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with an Adamant nature and Life Orb makes Armaldo as strong as possible while also making it extremely fast under rain, thanks to Swift Swim. Lum Berry is an option over Life Orb to provide more setup opportunities against Pokemon attempting to inflict status upon Armaldo, though the lack in power is disadvantageous.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to get Armaldo into the playing field as soon as rain is set up in order to maximize the number of turns Swift Swim is activated, and avoid switching out as much as possible so that Armaldo isn't worn down as easily. Armaldo should be used mid- to late-game as a wallbreaker or a sweeper. Once Armaldo finds an opportunity against a Pokemon such as specially defensive Roselia, it can set up a Swords Dance to clean up late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain setters such as Relicanth, Golduck, Electrode, and Volbeat are mandatory in order to activate Swift Swim; Relicanth can also provide Stealth Rock in order to weaken Armaldo's checks and counters. Other Swift Swim users such as Gorebyss and Golduck are able to utilize rain once it is active and wear down Armaldo's checks and counters. Roselia is a great partner for Armaldo, as it can take on most of its weaknesses while also providing Spikes, which is important for wearing down Armaldo's checks and counters. Electric-types such as Rotom-F and Zebstrika are helpful for beating opposing Water-types that can take advantage of rain.</p>"

  "Banette": {
    "overview": "<p>Banette is generally outdone as a physical attacking Ghost-type by Drifblim, which has a secondary STAB move and can sweep with Unburden, and Dusknoir, which has better coverage and more bulk. However, Banette has a slight niche with its increased power and ability to go mixed to lure common Ghost-type checks such as Vullaby. Additionally, Banette has a nice support movepool with moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, but it has poor physical coverage with just Ghost-, Dark-, and Poison-type attacks. Its low bulk and mediocre Speed mean it is easily revenge killed, and though it does have access to priority in Sucker Punch, it is not boosted by STAB and therefore is not strong enough to KO fast attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Banette has a long list of alternate utility moves it could run, including Thunder Wave, Taunt, and Destiny Bond, but it doesn't really have room for them. Banette's strongest Ghost-type STAB move, Phantom Force, could be used, but it gives the opponent a free turn, and Shadow Sneak is an alternative to Sucker Punch that will hit the target regardless of the move they use, but it is weaker. A Choice Band set with Trick could be run, but Banette wouldn't be hitting much harder, and locking it into one move could make it setup fodder. Banette's other two abilities, Cursed Body and Frisk, could be used to potentially disable a foe's move and as a way to determine foes' sets through their held item, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: As Banette is very frail and slow, faster Pokemon can easily outpace it and KO it with their respective moves, such as Simipour, Monferno, and Rotom-F, though they have to be healthy enough to take a Sucker Punch. Faster priority users such as Floatzel and Murkrow can revenge kill a weakened Banette without worrying about Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Tangela, Clefairy, and Relicanth take little damage from Shadow Claw and can use it as setup fodder; however, the former two are crippled by Knock Off and the latter by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Stoutland and Ursaring are immune to Shadow Claw, do not mind getting burned, and have enough bulk to easily take a Sucker Punch. Audino completely walls Banette, can recover any lost damage, and can wear it down with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Banette is crippled greatly by all forms of status and is much easier to take down once afflicted, so common status spreaders such as Prinplup and Stunfisk make good checks.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Claw is Banette's strongest STAB move, dealing heavy damage when boosted by Life Orb. Sucker Punch provides Banette with priority, is used over Shadow Sneak for its power, and allows it to deal damage to Normal-types and to pick off any weakened foes. Dazzling Gleam lands a 2HKO on Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage, a common switch-in to Banette, and gives Banette a way to hit Dark-types such as Cacturne. Knock Off cripples Eviolite users such as Tangela and any wall that switches into Banette; Hidden Power Fighting is an option to OHKO Pawniard and deal heavy damage to Probopass; and Will-O-Wisp can wear down walls and severely weaken physical attackers such as Relicanth and Golem. If Hidden Power Fighting is used, Thunderbolt is an option over Dazzling Gleam, as this combination maintains coverage on Vullaby and other Dark-types while also hitting bulky Water-types such as Pelipper and Prinplup hard. Pursuit could be used in the last slot to trap Psychic-type Pokemon such as Grumpig or weakened Pokemon fearing Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>40 EVs in Special Attack guarantee a 2HKO on Vullaby with Dazzling Gleam after Stealth Rock damage. 220 EVs in Speed let Banette outspeed Pawniard, and the rest goes in Attack to maximize damage from Shadow Claw and Sucker Punch. Life Orb is used because Banette needs the boost in power to deal significant damage, and a Naughty nature gives Banette the necessary boost in Attack without compromising damage from Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Fighting. Insomnia is used to give Banette an immunity to sleep-inducing moves such as Sleep Powder from Jumpluff.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Banette should be used to weaken walls early- and mid-game or to revenge kill fast threats throughout the game. Spamming utility moves such as Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp is an effective strategy to weaken the enemy team for a sweeper or late-game cleaner. Banette should try to avoid taking hits when entering the battle, so it is best brought in to revenge kill or on a predicted non-damaging move. Try to delay revealing Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Fighting to surprise the opponent; however, be aware that Dazzling Gleam has to be used on a predicted switch to Vullaby for it to be 2HKOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Monferno and Huntail pair well with Banette, as it can wear down walls to allow them to sweep. The former particularly likes Banette's ability to take out Psychic-types, so it is an excellent partner to Pursuit Banette. Entry hazard-stacking Pokemon such as Quilladin and Smeargle also pair well with Banette, as it can be used as an offensive spinblocker. Since Banette lacks a huge amount of power, stronger wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Leafeon are appreciated to help Banette wallbreak.</p>"

  "Dusclops": {
    "overview": "<p>Dusclops carves itself a niche in PU as an incredibly bulky Calm Mind sweeper, avoiding the 2HKO from the majority of PU. Even some of the Pokemon that check Dusclops, such as Misdreavus and Leafeon, fail to OHKO it and are hit very hard in return, thus needing Dusclops weakened to effectively defeat it. However, Dusclops's low offensive presence makes it really passive, so it's set up fodder for Pokemon, such as Ninetales and Nasty Plot Simipour. Calm Mind solves this to an extent, but the problem is still there. Furthermore, Dusclops has huge Knock Off and Taunt weaknesses, the former being very annoying, as Dusclops relies heavily on Eviolite to set up, and the latter being especially noticeable because of Dusclops's low Speed. Its big reliance on Rest to heal off any damage or status also makes it even easier to take advantage of. Last but not least, Dusclops faces a lot of competition from other Ghost-types that have more uses in PU, such as Misdreavus, but nevertheless, Dusclops fits on defensive teams that need a spinblocker and a win condition in one Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With the moves Trick Room, Memento, Night Shade, and Will-O-Wisp, Dusclops is a passable Trick Room setter, but the viability of Trick Room teams is questionable. It also needs to watch out for Purugly and Pawniard, as they can get a free boost from Memento. A fully defensive set with the moves Night Shade, Will-O-Wisp, Curse, and Pain Split is usable but it's even more passive than the Calm Mind set. Taunt allows Dusclops to stop opposing Calm Mind-boosting Pokemon, but most of the time you're better off letting a teammate handle them, as it does not beat them by itself. Because of Dusclops's low Speed, it is hardly ever able to Taunt the foe before it can move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Mightyena can easily defeat Dusclops with their super effective STAB moves. Pawniard can also remove Dusclops's Eviolite with Knock Off or set up with Swords Dance against it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types hit Dusclops for super effective damage with their STAB moves and take it out that way. Misdreavus can also Taunt Dusclops, stopping it from setting up or using Rest, or set up a Nasty Plot on it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Dusclops is incredibly weak without a boost, so Taunt users can easily stop it from doing significant damage. Misdreavus does especially well against Dusclops, but other Taunt users, such as Simipour and Dodrio, also work well.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Dusclops is incredibly weak to Knock Off because of its Ghost-typing and reliance on Eviolite for its bulk. Pawniard is especially threatening to Dusclops, as it gets STAB on Knock Off, but other users such as Simisage and Leafeon can also cripple Dusclops.</p> <p><strong>Faster Setup Sweepers</strong>: Faster setup sweepers such as Ninetales and Kingler boost faster than Dusclops and can thus eventually break through it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Dusclops's Special Attack and Special Defense, granting it a way to sweep. Rest is a mandatory source of recovery because, without any means of recovering health, Dusclops would get worn down too fast. Will-O-Wisp is the best option in the third moveslot, as it cripples physical attackers, making it even easier for Dusclops to set up on them, and it is the only move that has any use before attempting to sweep. Will-O-Wisp is especially useful against Dark-types, such as Mightyena and Pawniard, that tend to switch in against Dusclops. Shadow Ball can also be used, as a STAB move with solid power that hits opposing Ghost-types that like to switch in against Dusclops and Taunt it, such as Misdreavus. However, Shadow Ball should only be used if you're using Ice Beam in the fourth moveslot, as it has little synergy with Dark Pulse. Sleep Talk is another option here, as it ensures that Dusclops does not just sit there after using Rest and makes Dusclops able to set up on Tangela and Jumpluff. Ice Beam has good super effective coverage and hits Pokemon immune or resistant to Shadow Ball if you decide to use it. Dark Pulse is an alternative option as it also hits Ghost-types and has decent neutral offensive coverage. Shadow Ball mostly hits the same targets but forces Dusclops to forgo Will-O-Wisp and cannot deal any damage against Normal-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Dusclops to easily take most physical hits while boosting its Special Defense and Special Attack with Calm Mind. Dusclops can afford Special Attack investment, as it already has more than enough bulk. Pressure is the ability of choice because it is the only chance for Dusclops to win PP wars. Eviolite gives a 1.5x boost to both of its defenses and is the only thing that keeps Dusclops from being totally outclassed by Dusknoir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up mainly against Pokemon like Bouffalant, Arbok, and Swanna that fail to break through Dusclops's bulk. Do not try to set up with Dusclops if the opponent still has a threatening setup sweeper alive and you don't have a switch-in for it, as Dusclops is a very passive Pokemon and multiple threats to defensive teams, such as Ninetales, Duosion, and Ursaring, are able to set up on it. Double switches are very important in situations like these. Dusclops works best late-game when most setup sweepers and Taunt users, such as Misdreavus and Simipour, which are extremely annoying for Dusclops, are gone, as it heavily relies on Calm Mind and Rest. However, it can also be used earlier in the game, even when you're not attempting to set up, to counter Pokemon, such as Jumpluff and Tangela, as long as you're not too generous with switching Dusclops in against Pokemon that might carry Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Knock Off absorbers such as Muk can help to protect Dusclops's Eviolite. Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes support from Golem, Quilladin, and Roselia among others helps wear down the opposing team. Toxic Spikes in particular is convenient because it makes Dusclops capable of outstalling Pokemon such as Audino that would otherwise be able to stop it. Dusclops can also block Rapid Spin, which is nice for entry hazard stacking teams. However, most, if not all, Defog users can remove entry hazards against it. Dusclops should only be used on defensive teams, so other walls such as Audino and Altaria are mandatory teammates.</p>"

  "Tropius": {
    "overview": "<p>Tropius is a pretty bad Pokemon in PU; even though it has a niche as a bulky SubSeeder with access to the combination of Sitrus Berry and Harvest, it is largely outclassed by Gourgeist-S. It has decent bulk, allowing it to handle Pokemon such as Leafeon and Cacturne. However, its Grass / Flying typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock as well as to common attacking types such as Fire and Ice. Tropius is also outclassed as an offensive Grass-type by the likes of Leafeon and Sawsbuck. Its low Speed holds Tropius back, as it can be easily Taunted by the likes of Misdreavus and Grumpig, Encored by Kadabra, or taken out by faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Rotom-F.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball provides Tropius with a secondary STAB attack to hit Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Golem, Stunfisk, and Prinplup super effectively. Tropius has access to Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, allowing it to try a physical set containing moves such as Leaf Blade, Aerial Ace, and Earthquake, but such a set is outclassed by Leafeon and Sawsbuck. A special set with Chlorophyll or Solar Power can be used with Solar Beam, Air Slash, Hidden Power Fire, and Sunny Day or Synthesis but is outclassed by Weepinbell. Whirlwind can phaze foes and rack up entry hazard damage. Roost gives Tropius a more reliable form of recovery at the expense of being able to wear down foes with Leech Seed. Lum Berry in conjunction with Rest and Harvest can remove status and fully restore Tropius's health.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Rotom-F, Cryogonal, and Regice don't mind taking an Air Slash and can outspeed Tropius and OHKO it with Blizzard, Freeze Dry, and Ice Beam respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Monferno and Rapidash can threaten Tropius with their STAB moves. Ninetales can also proceed to set up Substitute if Tropius stays in to Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good special bulk such as Audino, Bronzor, Muk, and Grumpig can shrug off Air Slash and either cripple Tropius with status or simply deal damage to Tropius.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Tropius is fairly slow, so Pokemon that can outspeed and Taunt it can hinder its capabilities. Examples of this include Misdreavus and Grumpig.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock takes 25% of Tropius's health every time it switches in, and common Stealth Rock setters such as Golem carry super effective moves against Tropius.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tropius hates being inflicted with status conditions, so Pokemon that can cripple Tropius with burn, poison, or paralysis before it can set up a Substitute are problematic. Examples include Gourgeist-XL and Toxic Grumpig.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Pokemon such as Duosion and Clefairy don't lose any health from Leech Seed thanks to Magic Guard and can proceed to set up Calm Mind or Stealth Rock.</p>",

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed recovers health with each turn while slowly wearing down the foe or forcing switches. Substitute protects Tropius from status and brings it to Sitrus Berry range. Air Slash allows Tropius to hit other Grass-types such as Tangela and Leafeon, which are immune to Leech Seed, as well as Monferno, the most common Fire-type. Protect racks up Leech Seed damage while providing an extra turn to acquire a Sitrus Berry through Harvest. Toxic can be used to wear down bulkier foes such as Audino and Grumpig, which Tropius struggles with, as well as setup sweepers such as Beheeyem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs maximize Tropius's bulk while minimizing Stealth Rock damage. Maximum investment in Defense along with a Bold nature gives Tropius added physical bulk to better handle Pokemon such as Cacturne and Leafeon. Harvest is the preferred ability, as it gives Tropius a 50% chance to recover its Sitrus Berry after it has been used. Sitrus Berry is Tropius's main form of recovery, as it restores its health when it gets low and can be reused thanks to Harvest. 72 EVs in Speed could be run to outspeed uninvested base 60s such as Tangela, which Tropius can then 2HKO with Air Slash before it can 2HKO Tropius with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Protect as a means to scout your foe's attack and get another turn to recover Tropius's Sitrus Berry or recover health from Leech Seed, but make sure sweepers don't use Tropius as setup bait. Switch Tropius in on a move it resists, an example being Leafeon's Leaf Blade. From there, Tropius can proceed to set up Substitute as the opponent switches out or use Protect to see if the foe carries super effective coverage moves against it. Be mindful of switching Tropius in on neutral attacks, as it can get worn down easily even with Sitrus Berry and Harvest, with strong physical attackers such as Stoutland being able to 2HKO it. Using Leech Seed is Tropius's main priority, but you must be careful of using it on Pokemon that are immune to it, namely the likes of Clefairy and Sap Sipper Zebstrika. If running Toxic, it should be used early to cripple bulkier foes and setup sweepers that Tropius has trouble with, such as Beheeyem. Keep Tropius as healthy as possible, as being inflicted with status will hinder Tropius for the duration of the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roselia, Golem, and Monferno helps Tropius wear down foes faster. Toxic Spikes is especially helpful, as it aids Tropius in wearing down bulkier foes such as Audino and Grumpig. Pokemon that can handle Grass- and Steel-types for Tropius, such as Rotom-F, Magnet Pull Probopass, Monferno, and Bronzor, make it easier for Tropius to function. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Grumpig and Audino can rid Tropius of burn and poison, which would otherwise hinder it. These Pokemon can also check special attackers that Tropius has trouble with. Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Ursaring appreciate Tropius's ability to wear down foes with Leech Seed. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal can remove Stealth Rock, making it easier for Tropius to function.</p>"

Taunt also allows Glalie to prevent leads such as Golem from setting up entry hazards, and its high Speed allows it to outspeed most spinners and Stealth Rock setters. However, Glalie faces slight competition as a Spikes suicide lead from Venipede and Quilladin; the former has Speed Boost and Endeavor, and the latter is bulkier. Glalie is also limited to only one layer of Spikes due to its poor bulk. Glalie is one dimensional due to its average at best stats along with a poor defensive typing, and it is outclassed by other offensive Ice-types such as Regice if it attempts to run an offensive set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Shard could be used to pick off weakened Pokemon, but Glalie lacks the moveslot for it. Ice Beam is a slightly stronger STAB move, but Freeze-Dry notably allows Glalie to hit Swanna for more damage. Super Fang cripples bulky Pokemon such as Probopass and Metang that would otherwise wall it, though Glalie also lacks the moveslot for it. Maximum Special Attack investment can let Glalie deal more damage to Vullaby, but it is not worth it, as you would rather Taunt it and set up Spikes. An offensive Glalie set could be run, but there's no reason to use it over Regice, which has more power, better coverage, and Rock Polish to boost its Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Electrode and Misdreavus are able to outspeed Glalie and prevent it from setting up Spikes; the latter is also immune to Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Move Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Armaldo and Golem can break through Glalie's Focus Sash thanks to Rock Blast; the former can also remove Spikes with Rapid Spin. However, both are unable to set up Stealth Rock on Glalie due to Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Mr. Mime limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes and also prevent it from using Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Monferno are able to prevent Glalie from using Explosion and limit it to one layer of Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Taunt makes them unable to set up Stealth Rock, Steel-types such as Metang and Probopass resist both Freeze-Dry and Explosion, and they can deal super effective damage in return.</p>",

Explosion prevents Rapid Spin from Pokemon such as Armaldo and allows a teammate to get in safely. Freeze-Dry mainly hits Defoggers such as Vibrava and Swanna if Glalie has finished setting up Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread allows Glalie to outspeed as much as possible and deal as much damage as possible with Explosion. A Naive nature is chosen to preserve the power of both Freeze-Dry and Explosion. A Focus Sash allows Glalie to set up at least one layer of Spikes. Inner Focus allows Glalie to set up a layer of Spikes on Purugly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, Glalie should be used as a lead so its Focus Sash can stay intact and because Spikes are more effective when set up early in the match. However, be wary of faster Taunt users such as Electrode and Misdreavus and multi-hit move users such as Golem. Only use Taunt if you predict that the opponent will attempt to set up entry hazards or sweep. Taunt should also be used to prevent Defoggers from removing Glalie's Spikes. Glalie should prioritize setting up Spikes over using Freeze-Dry, as Spikes are more beneficial and Freeze-Dry is weak most of the time. However, Freeze-Dry could be used to hit a faster Defog user such as Swanna switching in. Use Explosion if you predict a spinner such as Armaldo attempting to remove your team's Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Glalie fits on offensive teams because they can deal with spinners and Defoggers and appreciate the extra chip damage. VoltTurn teams especially appreciate Spikes support, as they can help force switches. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus can help deter spinners such as Armaldo. Stealth Rock from the likes of offensive Relicanth and Golem helps to deal further chip damage. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland, Chatot, and Floatzel appreciate Spikes support so that they can break through their threats more easily. Setup sweepers and late-game cleaners, such as Shell Smash Gorebyss, Substitute + Swords Dance Bouffalant, and Zebstrika, appreciate Spikes damage to clean up late-game. Defiant users such as Purugly and Pawniard help with deterring Defog users if Glalie has fainted.</p>"

Its otherwise poor defensive typing that leaves it weak to Fighting- and Rock-types, its weakness to Stealth Rock, and its lack of reliable recovery can make it very easy to wear down.</p>",

Walrein could also run an offensive Curse set with the moves Curse, Waterfall, Earthquake, and Avalanche, but it is brought down by faster Pokemon and status. Walrein could run a defensive Curse set as well, using the moves Curse, Rest, Sleep Talk, and Avalanche or Waterfall, although it's walled by common Pokemon such as Politoed and is crippled by Taunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raichu, Zebstrika, Rotom-F, and other Electric-types can hit Walrein for super effective damage and gain momentum against it by using Volt Switch.

Ice Beam can be used instead of Surf to hit Grass- and Dragon-types, including Roselia and Fraxure, with the former being immune to Toxic. Protect can give Walrein a free turn to recover HP with Leftovers, as well as stall a foe with a status affliction and scout attacks against Choice locked Pokemon like Rotom-F. Super Fang can break down a foe by halving its health and puts many Pokemon in range of being revenge killed by a teammate.

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash sharply boosts all of Huntail's offensive stats, allowing it to sweep weakened or offensive teams with ease. Waterfall is Huntail's strongest STAB move, while Sucker Punch allows Huntail to KO faster Choice Scarf users and beat out opposing priority users. Ice Beam helps Huntail break through Vullaby and physically bulky Grass-types such as Tangela. Double-Edge is an alternate option that allows Huntail to OHKO Roselia and Politoed after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside an Attack-boosting nature makes Huntail as strong and fast as possible after a boost to easily sweep teams. A Naughty nature is used with Ice Beam to avoid lowering its power, but if running Double-Edge, an Adamant nature will suffice. Water Veil prevents Huntail from being burned and can be used alongside Ice Beam, but it is incompatible with Double-Edge, forcing Huntail to use Swift Swim if running the move. White Herb prevents Huntail's defenses from dropping after using Shell Smash, allowing it to set up on weakened attackers more easily, although Wacan Berry can be run to be able to use Shell Smash versus the common Electric-types in the tier such as Zebstrika and Rotom-F.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Huntail is best used as a late-game cleaner once its checks and counters have been weakened or removed, and it should only be setting up on defensive or somewhat weak Pokemon lacking a super effective attack, such as Pelipper and Metang, as strong attackers such as Stoutland can simply KO it due to its mediocre bulk. The exception is that Huntail is capable of setting up Shell Smash versus opposing Electric-types if holding a Wacan Berry. Avoid trying to set up on faster Pokemon with Taunt such as Misdreavus, as well as Will-O-Wisp users such as Rapidash if not running Water Veil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Memento users such as Jumpluff and Misdreavus, as well as dual screens setters such as Meowstic-M, give Huntail extra setup opportunities versus stronger foes. Pursuit trappers such as Metang can forcibly break Kadabra's Focus Sash, allowing Huntail to KO it once it sets up. If running Double-Edge, Pokemon capable of luring Vullaby and physically bulky Grass-types, such as Taunt + Toxic Grumpig, can help facilitate a sweep. Similarly, if running Ice Beam, Politoed lures such as Choice Band Floatzel with Return will allow Huntail to sweep with its counter removed. Physical wallbreakers such as Dodrio and VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Raichu and Ninjask can also help wear down bulky Pokemon for Huntail. Entry hazard setters such as Golem and Roselia are also valued for the chip damage provided from Toxic Spikes, Spikes, or Stealth Rock.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gorebyss is one of the best sweepers in the tier thanks in part to having a great boosting move in Shell Smash, which also lets it become a potent wallbreaker, as well as a good Pokemon for rain teams thanks to a solid ability in Swift Swim, which makes up for its low Speed. However, it faces competition from Huntail as a Shell Smash sweeper, which has access to Sucker Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, and from Pokemon such as Golduck as a rain sweeper. Gorebyss's low Speed without a Shell Smash boost makes it easily taken out by naturally faster Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Simisage. Its below average Special Defense limits setup opportunities as well. On top of this, even with a Shell Smash boost, it can be easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-F and can be picked off by priority moves if in a weakened state.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be run to avoid taking status to allow Gorebyss to set up Shell Smash easier, but it comes at the loss of a coverage move. A Choice Specs set with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Psychic, and Hidden Power Grass can let Gorebyss function as a hard-hitting wallbreaker, but this is generally done better by Floatzel due to the latter's higher Speed and access to Switcheroo to cripple special walls.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Even after it has used Shell Smash, Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F, Mr. Mime, and Sawsbuck can outspeed and revenge kill Gorebyss with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority attacks such as Pawniard's and Mightyena's Sucker Punch and Purugly's Fake Out can limit Gorebyss's sweeping capabilities, but it can survive resisted hits such as Basculin's and Floatzel's Aqua Jet.

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash gives Gorebyss a significant boost to its Special Attack and Speed but lowers its defenses. Hydro Pump is Gorebyss's STAB attack, hitting most of the metagame hard including Rock- and Fire-types such as Probopass and Monferno. Ice Beam lets Gorebyss handle Grass-types, which resist Hydro Pump, such as Roselia and Jumpluff. Psychic lets Gorebyss hit other Water-types, especially Politoed, which is immune to Hydro Pump due to Water Absorb and resists Ice Beam. Surf is an option over Hydro Pump to have an accurate STAB attack at the cost of power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 252 EVs in Special Attack along with a Modest nature maximizes Gorebyss's damage output. 252 EVs in Speed allow Gorebyss to be as fast as possible to potentially sweep after a Shell Smash. A Timid nature can be run to outspeed Modest Electrode, Adamant Ninjask, and Choice Scarf Monferno, but doing so comes at a loss in power. White Herb restores Gorebyss's defenses after using Shell Smash so it isn't easily revenge killed, whereas Life Orb increases the amount of damage Gorebyss can deal out at the expense of lowering its health after every attack and making it easier to be revenge killed. Swift Swim is the preferred ability, as it doubles Gorebyss's Speed if it happens to be raining.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Shell Smash against Pokemon that can't do much to Gorebyss such as Metang. Gorebyss is best used as a mid- to late-game sweeper once faster Pokemon and priority users are eliminated. Avoid setting up against strong attackers such as Ursaring and Dodrio, as they can do a vast amount of damage to Gorebyss and hinder its ability to act as a sweeper. Gorebyss should also avoid setting up against faster Taunt users such as Misdreavus or against Pokemon that can carry Thunder Wave such as Kadabra.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dual screens support from Meowstic as well as Memento support from Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Misdreavus makes it easier for Gorebyss to set up. If using dual screens or Memento support, other setup sweepers such as Rock Polish Regice and Dragon Dance Fraxure are good partners to have if Gorebyss doesn't have a favorable matchup. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem, Stunfisk, and Metang can help wear down foes for Gorebyss, making it easier for it to sweep. The latter can also Pursuit trap Kadabra and deal with Regice, which can revenge kill Gorebyss. Pokemon that can deal with Politoed such as Roselia and Zebstrika make for good partners, and Roselia can also use Politoed as fodder to set up Spikes for Gorebyss. Pokemon that can deal with Electric- and Grass-types, such as Stunfisk and Regice, make for good partners to Gorebyss. While it isn't mandatory, Gorebyss can also function on Rain teams with Pokemon such as Volbeat and Electrode setting rain to aid in providing a boost to Gorebyss's Speed thanks to Swift Swim and a boost to Gorebyss's Water-type STAB attacks.</p>"

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>Relicanth is a multifaceted Pokemon in the PU metagame that is able to use its immense physical bulk and useful resistances to Flying-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves from Pokemon such as Dodrio and Rapidash to set up Stealth Rock reliably on both defensive and offensive sets. With access to Rock Polish and a respectable Attack stat, Relicanth can threaten the opposition very easily with dual STAB coverage in Head Smash and Waterfall. Additionally, given its access to both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock and a beneficial ability in Sturdy that allows it to use these two moves reliably, Relicanth has carved out a niche for itself in PU as a dedicated lead on rain-based teams. On the downside, however, Relicanth's overall effectiveness is sometimes limited by its low Special Defense and Speed, as well as its weaknesses to other common attacking types such as Electric, Ground, Fighting, and especially Grass. Despite these flaws, Relicanth is still overall an advantageous choice for defensive and offensive teams alike, given its ability as a Stealth Rock user to pressure PU's most reliable options for hazard removal.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with Head Smash, Double-Edge, Waterfall, and Earthquake or Toxic is a usable option to turn Relicanth into a slow wallbreaker. However, its overall dysfunction in PU stems from the fact that it is too slow and therefore easily revenge killed by a plethora of faster threats with super effective coverage moves that can either outright KO it or force it out and consequently gain momentum. An offensive set that takes advantage of the effects of Rain Dance via Swift Swim can be attractive, given that Rain Dance also boosts the power of Relicanth's Waterfall. However, such a set is not recommended because this role as a physically offensive rain sweeper is performed better by other options, like Beartic and Armaldo. Moreover, using Swift Swim on Relicanth means that it will be using a much weaker Rock-type STAB move in Stone Edge because Head Smash without Rock Head results in Relicanth taking too much recoil damage. The only time using Head Smash without Rock Head is advisable is when Relicanth is being sacrificed in order to bring in a rain sweeper for free. While a Custap Berry can be used over Damp Rock on the lead set in order to set either Rain Dance or Stealth Rock with priority, the loss of Damp Rock shortens the duration of Rain Dance. Life Orb is an option on offensive sets using a Jolly nature and allows Relicanth to 2HKO Stunfisk and Probopass with Waterfall, but it is not recommended in all cases, as it detracts too much from the bulk Relicanth needs in order to reliably set up Rock Polish. While it is often better to maximize Relicanth's physical bulk on its Rock Polish set by aiming to beat Zebstrika and then reallocating the remainder of its EVs toward HP in order to allow it to set up Rock Polish more reliably, Relicanth can still run enough Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-F at +2. However, doing so means Relicanth will need to use a Jolly nature, which detracts greatly from its ability to sweep with Head Smash. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall on Relicanth's offensive sets for a slight boost in power, but the drop in accuracy and the loss of the flinch chance are undesirable, especially given that Relicanth is already relying on an inaccurate move in Head Smash to deal the bulk of its damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types such as defensive Tangela, Quilladin, Gogoat, and Gourgeist-XL can tank any hit outside of a Choice Band-boosted Head Smash and retaliate with a STAB attack. Furthermore, faster Grass-types such as Sawsbuck, Leafeon, Simisage, and Jumpluff are easily able to revenge kill Relicanth, unless it has used Rock Polish.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Raichu can outspeed and OHKO Relicanth, especially if Sturdy has already been deactivated via prior damage. Additionally, Electric-type Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F can outspeed Relicanth after a Rock Polish boost and OHKO it with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Relicanth is not using a Lum Berry, status effects can hamper offensive Relicanth's ability to function. For example, Pokemon with access to Will-O-Wisp such as Solrock and Misdreavus are able to halve Relicanth's damage output and consequently prevent it from sweeping. The damage over time from burn can also put Relicanth in range of being KOed by threats that appreciate Relicanth's Sturdy being broken or its longevity being limited.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that can hit Relicanth on its weaker Special Defense stat pressure it offensively and often disallow the usage of Rock Polish. For example, Choice Scarf Mr. Mime and Choice Scarf Rotom-F both outspeed Relicanth even after a Rock Polish and can OHKO it via Focus Blast and Thunderbolt, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Faster Users of Taunt</strong>: With access to Taunt, Misdreavus and Grumpig can stop Relicanth from setting up Stealth Rock or Rain Dance for its teammates, using a status move, or boosting its Speed via Rock Polish. Furthermore, Misdreavus has enough physical bulk to survive a Head Smash from offensive variants and burn Relicanth on the following turn with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Head Smash</strong>: Thanks to their resistance to Head Smash via advantageous typing and naturally high bulk, Pokemon such as Gabite and physically defensive Stunfisk prevent Relicanth from spamming its main STAB move and can OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage in return. Klang and Metang also resist Head Smash and take little damage from Relicanth's attacks unless it is using Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides support for Relicanth's teammates by damaging switch-ins and possibly deactivating Sturdy and Focus Sashes. Head Smash can be used in tandem with Rock Head; however, if Sturdy is run for a better chance to set up Stealth Rock, Rock Slide should be Relicanth's STAB attack of choice. Toxic is used to cripple bulky switch-ins when your opponent is under the assumption that Relicanth is running an offensive set. Yawn is also an option over Toxic to force switches and provide Relicanth with more opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, as well as the means to avoid being set up on by Pokemon such as Duosion. Protect is very helpful for restoring HP via Leftovers and possibly stalling with Toxic. Protect can even be used in combination with Yawn to keep Relicanth safe as it waits for its foe to fall asleep. Waterfall is a secondary option that helps hit Pokemon that resist Head Smash harder, such as Golem. Scald can be used on defensive sets for the 30% chance to cripple physical attackers via a burn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy prevents Relicanth from being OHKOed and lets it lay Stealth Rock more reliably. If Head Smash is used, Rock Head should be Relicanth's ability of choice to avoid recoil damage. This set is meant to be used as a wall; therefore, Relicanth should fully invest its EVs in HP and Defense and use an Impish nature to maximize its physical bulk. When running Scald, a Relaxed nature should be used. Investing up to 48 EVs in Speed is a secondary option and allows Relicanth to outspeed Vullaby and Tangela. Doing so can be advantageous, given that STAB Head Smash 2HKOes Vullaby even without any Attack investment. Outspeeding Tangela also has the added benefit of laying Stealth Rock or crippling it with Toxic before being taken down. Leftovers is normally Relicanth's only form of recovery and can be used in combination with Protect to give it some extra longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Relicanth can use its Rock typing and superior physical bulk to continuously switch in on threats whose moves it resists in order to set up Stealth Rock and weaken the opponent's team via its STAB attacks or Toxic. Relicanth is meant to be used as a physical wall with this set and therefore can come in at any point in a match in order to check or counter threatening physical attackers, although it is ideal to set up Stealth Rock early- or mid-game so that it can do as much damage as possible. On the turn Relicanth forces physical attackers out, such as Purugly, Dodrio, or Stoutland locked into Frustration, it can use Stealth Rock and switch out afterward. If Stealth Rock is already up on the opponent's side of the field, Relicanth should use this opportunity to hit something with Head Smash or Toxic. Protect is especially helpful for restoring HP via Leftovers and can be used every other turn if Relicanth is staying in against a threat that has already been hit by Toxic. It also has the added bonus of easing prediction and protecting Relicanth from super effective attacks. However, spamming Protect can be dangerous because such a play soon becomes obvious to the opponent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon possessing either a 4x resistance to Grass-type attacks or the ability Sap Sipper, such as Sawsbuck, Bouffalant, Gogoat, Zebstrika, Jumpluff, or Roselia, can make for a great partner, given that Relicanth will be consistently drawing in your foes' Grass-type attacks. Specially defensive Roselia forms a very strong defensive backbone with physically defensive Relicanth that is only beaten by a few choice Pokemon with strong offensive coverage, such as Simisear, Ninetales, and Rock Polish Regice. Rapidash is therefore another strong choice for a teammate because it forces both Simisear and Ninetales out with its superior Speed and Drill Run, and beats Regice with its STAB Flare Blitz while resisting Regice's Ice Beam. Like Roselia, Pokemon with high Special Defense in general can help account for Relicanth's lower Special Defense stat and synergize well as a result. Given that Roselia and Relicanth will be stacking entry hazards together, Pokemon that can protect these entry hazards or deter the use of Defog are exceptionally useful partners. For example, Misdreavus can block Rapid Spin and Taunt slower Defoggers such as Vullaby and Vibrava, whereas Pawniard and Purugly can come in on a predicted Defog, boost to +2 Attack via Defiant, and proceed to threaten the opponent's team. Pokemon with an immunity to Electric-type attacks, including Lightning Rod users such as Zebstrika and Raichu as well as Ground-types such as Stunfisk, are useful for preserving Relicanth.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish doubles Relicanth's Speed, allowing it to outspeed many offensive threats and KO them with a STAB-boosted Head Smash. Head Smash hits exceptionally hard and has the potential to sweep unprepared teams after a Rock Polish boost. Head Smash and Waterfall have excellent coverage together, while Earthquake can be used along Head Smash and Waterfall to hit Pokemon that take little damage from Waterfall like Metang. Earthquake also OHKOes Probopass after Stealth Rock damage has been factored in, as well as Zebstrika after a Rock Polish boost. Relicanth can also use Toxic in its last slot, which allows it to cripple bulky switch-ins such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rock Head should be Relicanth's ability of choice, as it lets it use Head Smash without incurring any recoil damage. Chople Berry is the preferred item because it allows Relicanth to take Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Stoutland and Monferno once, which provides Relicanth with the opportunity to either set up or continue its sweep. Stone Plate is also a viable option as an item, as the damage boost lets Relicanth OHKO standard Roselia with Head Smash. Using a Lum Berry can cure any status ailment that would otherwise prevent Relicanth from sweeping after it has set up with Rock Polish. Leftovers is a viable option as well, letting Relicanth check Pokemon such as Purugly and Pawniard more consistently throughout the game and healing off damage incurred from entry hazards. The given EV spread and an Adamant nature maximize Relicanth's offensive capabilities. A minimum of 148 EVs in Speed should be used to let Relicanth outspeed neutral-natured base 70s and everything slower before using Rock Polish, which includes relevant targets such as Solrock, Vibrava, and Roselia. These Speed EVs also allow Relicanth to outspeed Zebstrika and other fast yet frail offensive threats after a Rock Polish boost. An alternative spread with maximum Speed investment and an Adamant nature can be used to let Relicanth outspeed additional threats before it boosts, such as Armaldo and Regice. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-F after a boost, but the loss in power is quite noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Relicanth's primary function is as a bulky setup sweeper and cleaner, and it should use its Rock typing and superior physical bulk in order to switch in on physically based threats whose attacks it resists, such as Dodrio and Purugly. Relicanth can also force out more defensively oriented Pokemon that are weak to Head Smash, such as Armaldo and Vullaby. Once it has forced out a Pokemon that it counters, Relicanth should use this turn to set up via Rock Polish or attack with Head Smash. Relicanth is best used mid- or late-game, once offensive threats faster than 366 Speed that can revenge kill it after a Rock Polish boost, such as Choice Scarf Rotom-F and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck, have been disabled or outright removed by Relicanth's teammates. Similarly, defensive answers to Relicanth such as Stunfisk and Tangela need to be weakened significantly before Relicanth can sweep through the opponent's team successfully.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Given Relicanth's weaknesses to Electric-, Ground-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks, Grass-types make for ideal partners. For example, Roselia resists all of Relicanth's weaknesses, barring Freeze-Dry, and at the same time, it is able to switch into Stunfisk, whittle down Relicanth's counters with entry hazards, and create setup opportunities for Relicanth via Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Simisage is a great offensive partner to Relicanth, given its ability to break down defensive Grass-types and Ground-types with a combination of Knock Off and Gunk Shot or a powerful STAB Life Orb-boosted Leaf Storm, respectively. Conversely, Relicanth appreciates powerful teammates that can take down bulky Grass-types, such as Regice, Articuno, Dodrio, Rapidash, Ninetales, Simisear, and Monferno. Fire-types are especially useful in this case, as they are immune to or can even take advantage of burns aimed at Relicanth. Pokemon that do not mind being burned by Will-O-Wisp due to their access to Guts, STAB Facade, or Flash Fire are ideal partners. For example, Scrappy Stoutland with Choice Band and Facade can use burns aimed at Relicanth as an opportunity to force out and pressure defensive answers to Relicanth such as Misdreavus. Relicanth enjoys having teammates that can break down the other team via entry hazards like Spikes and Stealth Rock, so that once it sets up a Rock Polish, it is able to clean more effectively. Stunfisk and Camerupt are notable Stealth Rock users that also provide Relicanth with dedicated switch-ins to fast Electric-types like Electrode and Zebstrika that give it trouble, even despite sharing some weaknesses with Relicanth.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lead Relicanth's primary purpose is to set Rain Dance, which boosts the power of Water-type attacks and activates Swift Swim for its teammates. The addition of Stealth Rock allows teammates such as Golduck and Beartic the chance to sweep opposing teams without being stopped early by Pokemon that use Focus Sash or Sturdy. Similarly, the chip damage from Stealth Rock helps Pokemon that are benefited by rain make the most of Rain Dance by scoring the maximum number of KOs within the limited number of turns that Rain Dance provides. Head Smash is Relicanth's primary source of damage, and the recoil Head Smash causes can allow Relicanth to KO itself, which allows you to bring in a teammate for free that can take advantage of the effects of rain and helps preserve Stealth Rock by evading Rapid Spin and Defog. Yawn is used to create free turns to set up Stealth Rock or Rain Dance, while Waterfall is also an effective option to hit opposing Rock-types such as Probopass and Golem super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Relicanth's ability Sturdy in combination with maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature guarantees that it can set up either Stealth Rock or Rain Dance against the most targets, unless it is Taunted by a faster Pokemon. Its Attack stat should also be maximized so that its Head Smash can hit as hard as possible. Using Damp Rock increases the number of turns that Rain Dance will be in effect by three, which significantly bolsters the rate of success for rain-based teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Relicanth should be used early-game before your opponent has set up any entry hazards so that its Sturdy remains intact for when it needs to set up either Stealth Rock or Rain Dance. After Relicanth has successfully set up, it can be sacrificed so that a Pokemon that can take advantage of the effects of Rain Dance can come in for free. In most cases, Relicanth will be used as a lead; however, it should not stay in against faster Taunt users such as Misdreavus. While it is often advantageous to sacrifice Relicanth after it has set up Rain Dance and Stealth Rock, it can be preserved to stop physically based threats such as Dodrio and Rapidash mid- or late-game, or in case the opposing team has a method of removing Relicanth's Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lead Relicanth is built to support rain-based teams, so Pokemon that can take full advantage of the effects of Rain Dance are ideal. Pokemon such as Gorebyss, Armaldo, Beartic, Golduck, Swanna, Huntail, and Floatzel are all excellent options, thanks to Water-type attacks receiving a boost, Swift Swim being activated, and Hurricane becoming perfectly accurate in Swanna's case. Swanna's ability to remove the Grass-types that would otherwise wall or prevent Relicanth from setting up via its perfectly accurate STAB Hurricane makes it a great partner. Relicanth especially appreciates Volbeat as a teammate, which is able to consistently set up Rain Dance via Prankster and can also paralyze the opposition and therefore create opportunities for Relicanth to either attack with Head Smash or set up Stealth Rock. Volbeat also resists Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks for Relicanth, while in return, Relicanth can tank any Fire- or Flying-type attacks aimed at Volbeat. Pokemon that provide Relicanth with resistances or immunities to its weaknesses also deserve special mentions. For example, Zebstrika and Raichu can be used for their access to Sap Sipper and Lightning Rod, respectively, and they also benefit from Rain Dance by receiving an accuracy boost to Thunder. Finally, Grass-types synergize well with Relicanth because they are able to take on the Electric-types that would run through rain-based teams otherwise. Similarly, these Electric-types are not stopped by Volbeat's Thunder Wave, so Grass-types such as Roselia prevent them from beating rain teams when Rain Dance is no longer in effect. However, if Roselia is being used, it should avoid using Synthesis in favor of Rest with Natural Cure, as Synthesis recovers less HP when Rain Dance is in effect.</p>"

Thus, Roselia, Floette, and Sunflora make for good teammates; these Pokemon can also tank hits for Luvdisc in battle, as they are much bulkier. Your other teammates could depend on the kind of partners whose affection you're trying to win. Diamonds are a girl's best friend, and Carbink is therefore a good teammate to show your affection for a lady. It also hits harder than Luvdisc in battle, helping it to break down bulky foes such as Persian. As for their male counterparts, I've heard that dogs are a man's best friend, so you might want to pack a Stoutland or Growlithe on your team as well.</p>"

  "Metang": {
    "overview": "<p>Metang's Steel typing gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock and allows it to check Normal- and Flying-types. It has solid bulk combined with Eviolite, can function as a bulky pivot by virtue of its access to Stealth Rock, and has Meteor Mash to boost its average base Attack stat. Its Psychic typing gives it a neutrality to Fighting-type attacks, but it also gives Metang a weakness to Knock Off, which can be detrimental given that Metang relies on its Eviolite for bulk and is easily worn down without it. It lacks access to any recovery moves outside of Rest, has weaknesses to common Fire-, Ground-, and Ghost-type attacks, and faces competition from other Stealth Rock users, such as Stunfisk and Probopass.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt could be used in the third or fourth moveslot to better threaten Muk, OHKO Monferno, and deal more damage to Water-types such as Floatzel. Thunder Punch is another option which can lure and deal massive damage to Pelipper, but is otherwise fairly worthless. An EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def combined with an Impish nature helps Metang better handle Normal- and Flying types, while a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature helps Metang handle Psychic-types and special attackers better. Rest helps recover HP, which is helpful because Metang gets worn down too easily, but it is unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Spinners and Defoggers</strong>: Bulky Pokemon with Defog or Rapid Spin, such as Vibrava and Vullaby, can easily remove Stealth Rock and take minimal damage from  Metang. However, they have to watch out for Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Pokemon with Knock Off, such as Pawniard, are able to remove Metang's Eviolite and Pursuit trap it, making it less bulky and easier to KO.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus, are able burn Metang with Will-O-Wisp, while the latter is also able to Taunt it, preventing it from setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash can outspeed and KO Metang with their super effective Fire-type moves. However, they have to watch out for Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Metang fears a burn, which halves its Attack stat and prevents it from doing anything besides setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Metang can become setup fodder for sweepers such as Huntail, Duosion, and Kingler, which can boost their stats before breaking through Metang.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is the staple for Metang's team and is important for residual damage and breaking through Sturdy and Focus Sash users. Meteor Mash is Metang's strongest Steel-type move and has a chance to boost its Attack by 1 stage, although it is somewhat unreliable. Earthquake hits common Steel-types that wall Metang, such as Probopass and Pawniard. Bullet Punch can be used for priority to pick off weakened Pokemon, such as a weakened Kadabra. Pursuit lets Metang weaken Pokemon it forces out such as Psychic-types like Grumpig and other offensive Pokemon that Metang forces out. Toxic could be used in the last slot to put a timer on physically defensive walls that Metang can't touch, such as Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def and an Adamant nature allow Metang to inflict as much damage as possible and have a sizable amount of bulk, especially when combined with an Eviolite. Clear Body is Metang's only relevant ability, preventing Intimidate users such as Luxray and Arbok from lowering Metang's Attack stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Metang in on attacks it resists or is immune to and proceed to set up Stealth Rock or cripple the foe with Toxic. Toxic should primarily be used on physically defensive walls such as Tangela, Quilladin, and Misdreavus. Metang needs to be as healthy as possible in order to check an opposing threat. Metang is a good switch-in to Roselia and can force it out to stop it from setting up Spikes. Metang should switch into a Pokemon that has low offensive presence and is unable to touch it, such as Audino or Tangela, although it has to be wary of Audino's Knock Off. As Metang is a bulky pivot, it should set up Stealth Rock and damage the Pokemon it switches into as much as possible. Look out for Pokemon with coverage moves that can harm Metang, such as Dodrio and Leafeon, which carry Knock Off, as Metang isn't a fully safe switch-in to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers, such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL, can help to keep Stealth Rock on the battlefield, as Rapid Spin users such as Armaldo and Avalugg may remove Metang's Stealth Rocks with ease. Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate such as Rotom-F, Misdreavus, and Pelipper can switch into Ground-type attacks that target Metang. Pokemon with Defiant, such as Pawniard and Purugly, can switch into a predicted Defog and use it to their advantage. Setup sweepers, such as Huntail and Ninetales, appreciate entry hazard support and can break through Sturdy in order to successfully sweep. Audino can keep Metang healthy with Wish. Spikers, such as Roselia and Quilladin, can be used in conjunction with Metang's Stealth Rock for entry hazard stacking. Water-types, such as Simipour and Floatzel, have nice synergy with Metang, as they resist Fire-type attacks for Metang.</p>"

  "Regice": {
    "overview": "<p>Regice boasts one of the highest Special Defense stats in the game, which allows it to beat many special attackers 1v1, such as Chatot and Rotom-F. It's also helped by its high Special Attack stat and a solid movepool consisting of moves such as Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Focus Blast. Regice's low Speed is an issue, but it has access to both Rock Polish and Thunder Wave to alleviate this, allowing it to function as a potent sweeper or a bulky tank. Ice typing gives it a decently powerful STAB move to work with in Ice Beam, but it isn't a great defensive typing and hampers Regice's ability to switch in and out due to a Stealth Rock weakness. Furthermore, Regice's recovery is limited to Leftovers, meaning it will often be worn down quickly. Its weaknesses to Fighting, Rock, Steel, and Fire make its superb defenses less effective. However, Regice can run through teams by setting up a Rock Polish and taking advantage of its amazing coverage to become a serious threat later in the game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regice can attempt to run a Choice Specs set to cause havoc to opposing switch-ins with its fantastic coverage, though its slow Speed is unfixable in this scenario. Another option is Charge Beam, which can slowly increase Regice's Special Attack and subsequently make it harder to switch into. Frost Breath is an interesting option, as it always results in a critical hit with the cost of slightly lower accuracy. RestTalk is an option to give Regice some type of healing aside from Leftovers, and BoltBeam gives it great coverage to work with. Finally, ChestoRest is an interesting combo to fully heal Regice once with Rest and then wake up the same turn. This comes at the cost of losing Leftovers, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Special Walls</strong>: Bulky special walls such as Grumpig can take virtually any attack from Regice and can either cripple, phaze, or KO it. While Audino is 2HKOed by Regice's Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast, it can be considered a shaky check due to its impressive bulk.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Monferno, Simisear, and Rapidash resist Regice's Ice-type STAB move and can KO back with super effective Fire-type STAB moves, they both dislike taking a Thunder Wave though.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While Regice can use Rock Polish to boost its Speed to tremendous levels, a faster Choice Scarf user can normally outspeed and KO it, which is one of the main ways offensive teams beat it. Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mr. Mime with Psyshock and Stoutland in sand can outspeed and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Powerful Pokemon such as Choice Band Stoutland can easily strike at Regice's lesser Defense stat with their high-powered moves, weakening or outright KOing it, but they usually can't switch in on a Focus Blast and Thunder Wave can slow them down. Other powerful attackers such as Pawniard easily beat the tank set, but they have immense difficulty switching in and KOing Regice once it's at +2 Speed.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock chips 25% HP from Regice every time it switches in, which wears it down very fast, especially if Regice is using a Life Orb. In addition, status such as poison and burn will stack up over time and slowly take Regice down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish doubles Regice's Speed and turns it into a serious offensive threat late-game, allowing it to outspeed and KO many Pokemon. Ice Beam is Regice's most reliable STAB move to work with, striking Pokemon such as Roselia and Tangela for serious damage. Thunderbolt only adds to the coverage, hitting Water- and Flying-types such as Politoed and Swanna for super effective damage and forming the famous BoltBeam combo. Focus Blast gives Regice much-needed Fighting-type coverage against Probopass and Rotom-F.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Regice's Special Attack stat, which allows it to hit as hard as possible, and the 252 Speed EVs allow Regice to outspeed almost all Pokemon that lack a Choice Scarf after a Rock Polish. The final 4 EVs go into Defense to lower residual damage, and Life Orb provides a much-needed boost in power. Clear Body is Regice's only ability, but it prevents Regice's stats from dropping due to things such as Sticky Web.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rock Polish Regice is best used to sweep mid- and late-game, preferably when all its counters and checks have been severely weakened or KOed. In addition, Regice should primarily try to set up on special attackers that can't touch it, such as Choice-locked Rotom-F and Swanna (though Regice must be wary of Hurricane's confusion chance and Scald's burn chance). Other opportune moments to set up include when Regice forces a Pokemon such as Roselia or Floatzel out. Regice should aim to switch in on special attackers when faster Choice Scarf users have been dealt with and there's nothing stopping it from sweeping, as its bulk lets it absorb most special attacks quite easily. However, one should attempt clear the field of entry hazards beforehand to secure an easier time setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defoggers such as Swanna can use Defog to remove Stealth Rock and Spikes from the field, greatly increasing Regice's longevity. Swanna also resists Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, which is an added bonus. Regice also appreciates wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Floatzel as teammates because they can break and weaken opposing teams, which also makes Regice's job easier. Regice appreciates entry hazard support to weaken opposing teams, so Stealth Rock setters such as Golem are optimal as partners, as entry hazards can turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is Regice's main attack, getting STAB and providing great coverage against Pokemon such as Leafeon and Tangela. Thunderbolt forms the BoltBeam combo with Ice Beam, has great neutral coverage, and strikes Water-types which don't take much damage from Regice's other attacks. Focus Blast is Regice's final offensive option, providing critical coverage on Pokemon such as Audino and Probopass. Thunder Wave allows Regice to support its team as well as itself by slowing down the opposition, conveniently alleviating its otherwise poor Speed stat. Protect is a different option, allowing Regice to scout Choice item users and the foe's moves while also giving it a free turn for Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to minimize Stealth Rock damage and keep Regice bulky, while the other 252 EVs are put into Special Attack to remind opponents that Regice still packs a punch. The remaining 8 EVs are put into Special Defense for a slight increase in bulk. To maximize Regice's Special Attack, a Modest nature is used. Leftovers provides passive recovery and is the only form of HP recovery Regice has. Clear Body doesn't come into play very often, but it's Regice's only option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite having a passable Defense stat, Regice should rarely be kept in on faster physical attackers, as they could KO or weaken Regice severely to the point where it is no longer a threat. Thus, Regice should mainly be switched in on special attackers that cannot harm it, minimizing any damage taken on a switch in and forcing them out. When forcing an opposing Pokemon out, Regice should primarily attempt to predict the opposing switch and nail it with the appropriate coverage move or simply play it safe and use Thunder Wave to cripple them. The field should usually be cleared of entry hazards, as Regice will be switching in to absorb attacks, and losing HP just by switching in will greatly shorten the amount of times Regice can do its job.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vullaby is a good partner due to its access to Defog, allowing it to rid the field of entry hazards and give Regice an easier time switching in. Prinplup is another good defensive partner for Regice to soak up Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-type moves that could seriously harm or outright KO Regice, and Defog entry hazards as well. Due to Regice's bulky nature but lack of recovery, clerics such as Audino are good options as partners, at the cost of sharing a Fighting-type weakness.</p>"

  "Monferno": {
    "overview": "<p>Monferno is one of two relevant Fighting-types in PU, and it is a very versatile threat with access to utility moves like Taunt, Stealth Rock, and Will-O-Wisp. Its ability to use Eviolite and useful resistances to Grass-, Ice-, and Dark-type moves make it a key switch-in against threats like Leafeon, Mightyena, and Pawniard. Monferno fits on a wide variety of teams and primarily runs offensive sets, but it is also able to pull off defensively oriented sets to beat Rotom-F. Monferno can easily threaten the opposition with its dual STAB, high-Base Power moves in Close Combat and Flare Blitz, especially when they're boosted by Life Orb or Swords Dance. However, despite its access to such moves, offensive sets can still be walled by bulky Pokemon, like Stunfisk, or beaten by foes that resist its STAB-boosted moves, like Altaria. Monferno's mediocre Speed tier also means it is highly dependent on Mach Punch, so faster Pokemon with their own priority like Floatzel or those that resist Mach Punch like Mr. Mime can easily check it. Nevertheless, Monferno is still overall an advantageous choice for any type of team, given its ability to revenge kill weakened threats with Mach Punch, as well as its potential to break down defensive teams with its powerful dual STAB attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Monferno is able to run a Choice Band over Eviolite on its all-out attacker set for more immediate power. However, doing so means it's no longer able to switch between its dual STAB attacks and priority, which makes it easier to play around, and simultaneously limits its bulk. Hidden Power Ice and Rock Slide are both usable options for hitting Altaria harder, but they come at the cost of missing out on either Swords Dance or U-turn, which are arguably superior options. Fake Out can also be used instead of Swords Dance or U-turn for the purpose of revenge killing frail threats and deactivating Sturdy and Focus Sashes before attacking. A mixed set with Fire Blast is another alternative to hit physically defensive targets like Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Avalugg much harder without incurring recoil damage from Flare Blitz, but it is less useful overall without some investment in Special Attack. Using Flame Charge over U-turn lets Monferno act as a late-game sweeper with Flare Blitz and Close Combat, letting it outspeed faster Pokemon like Zebstrika, Dodrio, and Jumpluff without having to rely on Mach Punch. A lead set with both Taunt and Stealth Rock is viable on offensive teams, but it faces competition as an anti-lead from Pokemon more suited to beating Golem leads early-game, such as Misdreavus and Taunt Quilladin. Slack Off and a physically or specially defensive build can be used to switch into Pokemon like Pawniard and Rotom-F more reliably without being whittled down over the course of a match. Hidden Power Electric is another alternative to Hidden Power Ice, specifically nailing Swanna and Pelipper in favor of Altaria and Gabite.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Priority</strong>: Floatzel's and Basculin's Aqua Jet both outspeed Monferno's Mach Punch and are able to do severe damage to it, especially if Monferno is running Life Orb over Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Altaria resists everything in Monferno's arsenal outside of a Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ice and can hit back with a powerful Dragon-type move or Earthquake. Swanna hates switching into Monferno repeatedly, but it also resists Monferno's Fire- and Fighting-type moves and can OHKO it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Lumineon and Politoed are able to tank a hit from Close Combat and hit back with a STAB-boosted Scald. Faster Water-types like Basculin, Floatzel, and Simipour can also revenge kill Monferno.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Grumpig is able use its resistances to Fighting and Fire to switch into Monferno's STAB moves and check it with Psychic in return, although Grumpig should be careful of switching into U-turn. Mr. Mime is able to revenge kill Monferno thanks to its Psychic STAB moves and its 4x resistance to Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Stunfisk is able to survive any hit from Monferno, including a Swords Dance- and Life Orb-boosted Close Combat, and can OHKO Life Orb variants back with an uninvested Earth Power. Gabite, if run with maximum Defense, can do the same with its STAB Earthquake. If running an offensive set, Gabite outspeeds Monferno and can OHKO it via Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Monferno's hardest-hitting Fighting-type STAB attack and does considerable damage to the Pokemon that don't resist it, at the cost of a drop in both Special Defense and Defense, and scores OHKOs on Pokemon like Stoutland and Bouffalant after Stealth Rock damage. Flare Blitz is Monferno's most powerful physical Fire-type move, but the recoil can wear Monferno down quickly. Mach Punch provides Monferno with priority, letting it finish off faster, weakened Pokemon or slower Pokemon with access to priority like Pawniard. U-turn enables Monferno to pick up momentum for its teammates and severely damage Psychic-type switch-ins like Grumpig. Stealth Rock is a final option that can be used in the last slot over U-turn to wear down switch-ins over the course of a match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite boosts Monferno's bulk and allows it to check physical attackers like Pawniard and Mightyena more reliably, while Life Orb boosts Monferno's damage output at the cost of some bulk. Maximum investment in Attack with an Adamant nature lets Monferno hit as hard as possible, while 252 Speed EVs allow Monferno to outspeed neutral-natured base 80s such as Stoutland, Altaria, and Arbok. Using a Jolly nature is optional and lets Monferno U-turn on Timid Grumpig before being hit by Psychic. Iron Fist boosts the power of Mach Punch by 20%.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Monferno can be used at any point in a match, whether it be early-game to beat anti-leads like offensive Quilladin and Bullet Seed Leafeon, mid-game to take threats down with its powerful dual STAB attacks, or late-game to clean up with Mach Punch. Monferno's unique Speed tier can be used to revenge kill powerful wallbreakers like Adamant Stoutland with its STAB Close Combat. All-out attacker Monferno should use U-turn against predicted Altaria and Grumpig switch-ins and switch out to Pokemon that can handle these threats appropriately. Even with Eviolite, Monferno lacks the bulk to continually switch into strong attacks, meaning it will be worn down quickly over the course of a match. Monferno can be switched into Pokemon like Pawniard and Leafeon; however, it dislikes losing its Eviolite to Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers like Bouffalant and Metang are able to switch into and trap faster Psychic-types like Mr. Mime and Kadabra for Monferno, letting it clean late-game with Mach Punch uninhibited. Offensively, Monferno partners well with offensive Ice-types like Cryogonal, Regice, and Rotom-F that can whittle down its checks and counters, like Stunfisk, Vullaby, and Altaria. Monferno appreciates entry hazard setters that are able to weaken opposing teams to the point it can clean with Mach Punch, making Pokemon with access to Spikes like Quilladin and Roselia ideal partners. At the same time, they are able to use Stunfisk that may switch into Monferno as setup fodder for Spikes or wear it down with their respective Grass-type moves. Stealth Rock setters like Golem on offensive teams and Metang and Relicanth on balanced teams are adept at wearing down foes for Monferno. Given that it can be worn down easily over the course of a match, Mr. Mime's Healing Wish can be used to revive Monferno. Fast Electric-types like Electabuzz and Zebstrika are also able to form momentum cores with Monferno, and they can check the offensive Water-types that beat Monferno, as well as Flying-types like Altaria and Jumpluff. Pokemon that can switch into offensive Water-types like Basculin and Floatzel are useful for preserving Monferno, meaning bulky Grass-types and Pokemon with immunities to Water-type attacks like Politoed are excellent partners.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance doubles Monferno's Attack, letting it function as a sweeper. Close Combat is a strong and reliable STAB option that severely damages anything that doesn't resist it, but it comes at the cost of lowered defenses. Monferno's STAB Flare Blitz hits a large portion of the tier for heavy damage, but its recoil can be detrimental to Monferno's longevity. While less powerful than Flare Blitz, an Iron Fist-boosted Fire Punch can be used over Flare Blitz to preserve Monferno, as the recoil from both Flare Blitz and Life Orb has the potential to end its sweep prematurely. Mach Punch is a priority move boosted by Iron Fist that allows Monferno to deal with faster threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Its EV spread and nature maximize Monferno's Attack, while the given Speed lets Monferno outspeed neutral-natured base 80s. A Jolly nature is optional and lets Monferno outspeed Timid Grumpig, Modest Articuno, Glalie, positive-natured base 80s like Jolly Stoutland, and Klang after a Shift Gear. Iron Fist is Monferno's ability of choice and boosts the power of Mach Punch. Life Orb further boosts its power, while the bulk from Eviolite allows it to set up with Swords Dance more reliably.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Monferno should set up with Swords Dance mid- to late-game once faster Pokemon that can check it have been dispatched or put in range of Monferno's Mach Punch, like Mr. Mime. Monferno can use Swords Dance on the turn it forces out a threat it beats, like Pawniard or Mightyena. Pokemon like Grumpig, Stunfisk, and Altaria need to be weakened significantly before attempting a sweep. Monferno should switch out of faster Pokemon with priority, like Floatzel and Basculin given their ability to OHKO Monferno with Aqua Jet. A Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch can be used to pick off faster threats after some prior damage, like Rock Polish Regice, Sand Rush Stoutland, and Choice Scarf Sawsbuck.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong Pursuit trappers like Murkrow, Stoutland, Dodrio, and Metang are all useful for beating Psychic-types for Monferno so that it can sweep mid- to late-game with its Mach Punch. Stealth Rock users that can weaken opposing teams for Monferno to clean make for ideal partners; Steel-types like Probopass and Metang are especially effective for this, as Probopass gives Monferno a free switch with its slow Volt Switch, while Metang can Pursuit trap weaker Psychic-types that can stop a Monferno sweep like Kadabra. Hyper offensive leads with access to entry hazards are able to pressure foes to the point Monferno can clean with a Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch, like Golem, Glalie, and Venipede. Monferno's bulk with a Life Orb is lackluster, and therefore it enjoys Defog or Rapid Spin support to keep opposing entry hazards at bay. Vibrava is able to switch into Stunfisk, one of Monferno's checks, and Defog reliably, while Lumineon is able to switch into Water-types that threaten Monferno and Defog afterward. Fast Electric-types like Zebstrika and Choice Scarf Rotom-F are ideal partners, as they check threats to Monferno like Floatzel and Altaria. Finally, Sticky Web support from Leavanny is useful, as this allows Monferno to outspeed faster, grounded threats, which would check Monferno otherwise.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Monferno's strongest and most spammable STAB move, whereas Flare Blitz is just as strong and can hit most Pokemon that resist Fighting, but it is harder to spam due to recoil. U-turn provides momentum on predicted switches to checks such as Grumpig and Altaria. The last slot is mostly a filler; Mach Punch can revenge kill priority users and Speed-boosting Pokemon such as Pawniard and Sand Rush Stoutland, whereas Rock Slide allows Monferno to revenge kill Altaria while doing more damage to Swanna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs, a Jolly nature, and Choice Scarf allow Monferno to outspeed and revenge kill almost every unboosted Pokemon along with certain Speed boosters, such as Regice, and maximum Attack investment increases its power as much as possible. Blaze notably increases the power of Flare Blitz, though Monferno will most likely KO itself with recoil if in Blaze range. Iron Fist can be used with Mach Punch to allow Monferno to almost always OHKO Pawniard with Mach Punch after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Monferno should act as a revenge killer, as it can outspeed and KO most unboosted Pokemon, such as Zebstrika and Floatzel, or as a cleaner late-game when the opposing team has been weakened. Be careful when locking Monferno into a move, as Pokemon that resist that move can take advantage of it, such as Arbok, which can set up on Close Combat. U-turn is Monferno's main move early- and mid-game, when the opponent has healthy checks, so that Monferno can get momentum, though you should be wary of Stunfisk because it can paralyze Monferno with Static. Try not to reveal Choice Scarf early unless necessary, as Monferno can bait faster Pokemon such as Dodrio and Zebstrika that come in and try to revenge kill it. Though Monferno's typing allows it to counter Pokemon such as Pawniard, it should not be switched in if its speed and power will be required later in the game. Additionally, Monferno is put in KO range of +2 Pawniard's Sucker Punch if it takes a hit, which is problematic if it isn't running Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Monferno fits best on offensive teams that can support it by pressuring its checks and need a fast revenge killer. Pursuit trappers such as Murkrow, Bouffalant, and Metang are appreciated, as they can remove Psychic- and sometimes Ghost-types, making it easier for Monferno to spam Close Combat, and they can easily come in on targets thanks to Monferno's U-turn. VoltTurn partners, such as Ninjask and Zebstrika, work great because they can pressure and weaken Monferno's checks and provide it with opportunities to switch in. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia also help weaken Monferno's checks, as taking both entry hazard and U-turn damage prevents checks from switching too many times. Pokemon that can punish or bait and weaken Stunfisk, such as Rotom-F and Earthquake Metang, are great partners, as Stunfisk is the only Pokemon Monferno does not want to attack. Wallbreakers such as Leafeon and Stoutland can weaken opposing physically bulky walls in order for Monferno to clean late-game. Cryogonal is also a nice teammate, as it can weaken Water-types with Freeze-Dry and remove entry hazards, which helps Monferno stay healthy.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Monferno to overcome would-be checks to physical Monferno sets, such as Altaria, Stunfisk, and Huntail. Fire Blast is Monferno's primary STAB option, nailing Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangela and Steel-types such as Bronzor and Mawile while being its overall most reliable option against neutral targets such as Crustle, Muk, and Stunfisk. Focus Blast breaks through Audino and is Monfernoâ€™s strongest attack against other Normal-types such as Stoutland and Bouffalant, as well as against Probopass, Rotom-F, and Ninetales. Hidden Power Ice nails Dragon-types such as Gabite and Altaria and rounds out Monferno's coverage. Vacuum Wave is another Fighting-type option over Focus Blast that hits Pokemon such as Rotom-F before they can attack, but Monferno without Focus Blast fails to break Pokemon such as the aforementioned Encore Audino and Assault Vest Bouffalant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb increases Monferno's overall damage output, most notably when utilized alongside a Modest nature, which nearly guarantees Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Altaria after Stealth Rock damage. However, Eviolite grants Monferno more opportunities to set up with Nasty Plot and sweep, and Monferno can outspeed more threats such as Modest Misdreavus when running a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>All four of Nasty Plot Monferno's moves are unique to this set. Once any of Monferno's moves have been revealed, the opponent will begin to backpedal and rethink their entire gameplan. Therefore, choosing to not bring out Monferno until the most opportune time to set up with Nasty Plot provides the biggest surprise factor. If unrevealed, Nasty Plot Monferno is able to force out the opponent's physical Monferno answer, set up on the switch, and make the opponent sacrifice something to regain momentum. Compared to Flare Blitz and Close Combat on Monferno's more traditional set, Fire Blast and Focus Blast have much worse accuracy and less total PP to work with. Therefore, it is crucial against more defensively oriented teams to predict when the foe is staying in, switching out, or using Protect. Against more offensive teams, Nasty Plot Monferno doesn't have as great of a matchup, so you can afford to play it a bit more aggressively, not caring if it is prematurely taken out or not.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that appreciate walls such as Avalugg, Stunfisk, Bronzor, and Altaria being lured in and removed, such as Dodrio and Golem, enjoy Nasty Plot Monferno breaking down their checks for them. Pokemon such as Assault Vest Bouffalant, Zebstrika, and Hidden Power Electric variants of Floatzel can help remove or severely cripple Nasty Plot Monferno's biggest checks such as Grumpig, Pelipper, and Swanna, which can prevent Monferno from having its Nasty Plot sweep stopped abruptly. Similarly, teammates such as Leafeon that can take on common priority users like Aqua Jet Floatzel are also greatly appreciated, as Monferno's poor bulk leaves it weak to priority moves. Entry hazard setters such as Mawile, Crustle, and Roselia can help chip away at the opposition's health, which allows Monferno to more reliably sweep through the opposing team late-game. Mr. Mime is a fantastic team option, as it provides Monferno with a Psychic resistance and a second chance to set up and sweep again with Healing Wish.</p>"

  "Bibarel": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its amazing ability in Simple, Bibarel is still outclassed by common Water-types in the PU metagame such as Floatzel and Simipour. Although Bibarel's bulk isn't great, it is able to set up on weaker foes, such as Prinplup and Clefairy. On the downside, it is easily checked by many common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Tangela, Misdreavus, and Gourgeist-XL. Its mediocre bulk also makes it easy to take out before it gets the chance to set up, and even when it has set up it is still revenge killed by Pokemon such as Simipour, Simisage, and Zebstrika. Additionally, Bibarel is fairly passive, making it easy for strong, fast Pokemon to either set up on it or revenge kill it, though it can pick its foes off with Quick Attack. Because Water-types are so common in the PU metagame, it is hard to fit Bibarel on a team over Pokemon such as Floatzel, Simipour, and Huntail.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bibarel can also make use of a lead set with Stealth Rock, Scald, Taunt, and Thunder Wave to prevent opposing leads from setting up entry hazards, though it is faces competition from other leads such as Golem, Rampardos, and Glalie. Maranga Berry can also be used to allow Bibarel to take more special attacks, though it loses out on Chesto Berry, which grants it a form of relatively reliable recovery along with Rest. It can also be used as a Rain Dance lead, though it is outclassed by Relicanth, which can take any one hit with Sturdy. Amnesia can be used to severely boost Bibarel's Special Defense, but it becomes even more passive and forced to either rely on one attack or lose its only form of healing in Rest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulkier Grass-types such as Tangela, Quilladin, and Gourgeist-XL can all take at least one hit from Bibarel, even at +2, and KO in return with their STAB moves; Quilladin can also use Roar to phaze it or even set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Double-Edge Huntail and Kingler can relatively safely take hits from Bibarel and set up on it with Shell Smash or Swords Dance, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Monferno, Stoutland and Grumpig can both take a +2 Quick Attack from Bibarel and, in return, deal a lot of damage to it with Superpower and Focus Blast, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Simple, Curse boosts Bibarel's Attack and Defense by two stages, but it lowers its Speed by two stages as well. Waterfall is one of Bibarel's most reliable STAB attacks that can deal good damage to Pokemon that are immune to Quick Attack, such as Misdreavus. Quick Attack helps to make up for Bibarel's lack of Speed after a Curse, as it can deal a lot of damage at +2 as well as pick off weakened foes. Rest allows Bibarel to heal up to full health and alleviate any inflicted status at no cost along with Chesto Berry.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment along with maximum Special Defense investment and a Careful nature maximizes the amount of damage Bibarel can take from special attacks, while the remaining 4 EVs are placed into Attack to deal a bit more damage to Bibarel's foes. Simple is used to double any stat changes, making Curse more effective. A Chesto Berry is used along with Rest to fully heal Bibarel's health and alleviate any status that has been inflicted upon it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bibarel should aim to set up on Pokemon that can deal little damage to it and can't phaze it, such as Prinplup and Clefairy. It can also set up on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Armaldo and Golem. Once Bibarel is low on health or inflicted with status, it should use Rest in order to heal itself, making it easier to sweep. Bibarel can also be brought in against weakened foes to revenge kill them with Quick Attack. Generally, Bibarel should wait until the late-game, when its checks have been weakened, to set up, allowing it to sweep. However, Bibarel can also be used as an early-game wallbreaker, as it can deal decent damage with a boost up. Bibarel should not be switched into strong physical attacks, especially if it is weakened, but it can switch into attacks that it resists or is immune to, such as Dusknoir's Shadow Sneak and Prinplup's Scald. It can also be brought in safely by a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Vullaby.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bibarel fits best on balanced and offensive teams, as it requires support to take on its weaknesses, but it can also sweep late-game. Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Stunfisk, Probopass, Quilladin, and Roselia is helpful for wearing down Bibarel's checks. Bibarel appreciates wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Simisage, as they can hit bulkier foes hard, making it easier for Bibarel to sweep. Grass-types such as Roselia and Gourgeist synergize well with Bibarel as they check Water-types such as Kingler, which Bibarel has trouble handling, as well as take opposing Electric-type attacks, which Bibarel is weak to. Zebstrika is a good partner for Bibarel, as it can take on bulky Water- and Grass-types that trouble Bibarel. Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves, such as Misdreavus and Arbok, are also helpful to Bibarel. Bibarel also appreciates spinners and Defoggers such as Armaldo and Swanna, which help to prevent Bibarel from being worn down by entry hazards. Users of a slower Volt Switch or U-turn such as Probopass and Vibrava are helpful to get Bibarel in safely. Misdreavus is one of Bibarel's biggest checks, so Pokemon that can take it on, such as Scrappy Stoutland and Ninetales, make for good partners.</p>"

  "Kricketune": {
    "overview": "<p>Kricketune is an outclassed Sticky Web setter in PU, able to support its slow but powerful teammates by slowing down the opposing Pokemon, though not as well as other options. Kricketune has mild utility outside of setting up Sticky Web thanks to access to Taunt, Knock Off, and Endeavor. Unfortunately, entry hazard removal is common in PU, and as a suicide Sticky Web setter, Kricketune requires a lot of team support to keep Sticky Web up. Kricketune is also rather slow and not very threatening; thus, taking care of common Sticky Web partners is often enough to prevent Kricketune from bugging a team too much. Ultimately though, Kricketune is simply outclassed by options such as Leavanny and Smeargle, which boast higher Speed and more useful support options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kricketune does not have many other options; a non-Sticky Web set is either bad or outclassed by another Pokemon. Bug Bite is an option over Knock Off that gets boosted by Technician and allows Kricketune to 2HKO Leafeon. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky foes, but Kricketune does not have a spare moveslot for it. Sing can be used to neuter a threat, but its accuracy is terrible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Entry hazard removal is common in PU and will leave Kricketune's slower teammates more vulnerable to attacks. Rapid Spin users include Armaldo and Torkoal. Swanna is faster than Kricketune and thus avoids Taunt; it can then Defog away the Sticky Web and defeat Kricketune. Bulky Defog users, such as Pelipper and Vullaby, are susceptible to Kricketune's Taunt, but are able to use Defog against Kricketune's teammates; however, constant offensive pressure could easily cripple them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users are able to avoid Kricketune's Taunt and can Taunt it to prevent it from setting up Sticky Web. Misdreavus and Fraxure both have access to Taunt and are immune to Endeavor; they dislike Knock Off, though.</p> <p><strong>Immunity to Sticky Web</strong>: Flying-types and Levitate users are completely immune to the effects of Sticky Web. For example, Swanna, Dodrio, and Rotom-F can come in on a slower Pokemon and hit something hard. This could be problematic if the Sticky Web team lacks faster Pokemon that can deal with them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web allows Kricketune to slow down the opponent's team and support its slow teammates. Taunt is a great move that allows Kricketune to outspeed and prevent Defog users from removing Sticky Web. In addition, it prevents slower foes from stacking Spikes or setting up against it. Endeavor allows Kricketune to bring foes down to 1 HP after it activates its Focus Sash, letting a teammate finish them off. Knock Off removes items and is useful to weaken NFE Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Tangela, annoy stall teams by removing Leftovers, and discourage Ghost-types from switching in on Endeavor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Kricketune to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, letting it Taunt bulky Defog users before they remove Sticky Web, as well as set up Sticky Web and use Endeavor on as many foes as possible. Focus Sash almost guarantees that Kricketune will be able to set up Sticky Web and enables it to use Endeavor effectively. Kricketune should not invest in bulk because the set is designed as a suicide lead, and having less bulk enables it to utilize a more powerful Endeavor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kricketune should usually be used as a lead to maximize the effect of its Focus Sash and let it set up Sticky Web as soon as possible, unless it is obvious that the opponent will lead with a Pokemon that beats Kricketune, such as a faster Taunt user. If any Pokemon that has Defog comes in on Kricketune, use Taunt to prevent Sticky Web from being removed. Set up Sticky Web as soon as possible, and if it is certain that Sticky Web will remain on the field for the rest of the game, sacrifice Kricketune to give one of its teammates a free switch-in. After setting up Sticky Web, Kricketune should stay in and spam Knock Off to annoy the opponent until it gets brought down to its Focus Sash. After this, use Endeavor as much as possible to soften up foes. If Kricketune is up against a Toxic Spikes user, it is advisable to use Taunt first, then set up Sticky Web, because the residual damage from Toxic Spikes will limit its teammates' longevity. Against stall teams, it is advisable to simply use a combination of Taunt and Knock Off to wear down foes because Sticky Web rarely comes in handy against these teams. If a Pokemon that threatens to sweep your team comes in on Kricketune with an intact Focus Sash, Kricketune can use Endeavor and bring the foe down to 1 HP on the same turn it gets attacked and brought down to the Focus Sash, neutering a threat. If the opposing team has a Rapid Spin or Defog user, it isn't a bad idea to set up Sticky Web and switch out to preserve Kricketune in case the entry hazard needs to be set up again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kricketune should only be used on offensive teams because they can deal with the early loss of a teammate much better than defensive teams can. Offensive teams can also pressure Defog and Rapid Spin users more easily and usually have a way to beat stall teams that do not mind Sticky Web. Slow but powerful teammates can outspeed more Pokemon with Sticky Web up, as well as cripple Defog users. Examples include Ursaring, Marowak, and Beheeyem. Sticky Web teams also appreciate fast Pokemon, such as Ninetales, Simipour, and Choice Scarf Rotom-F; these Pokemon not only outspeed virtually the entire tier, including revenge killers, but provide insurance against Flying-types, Pokemon with Levitate, and opposing Sticky Web teams. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir can foil attempts to spin away Sticky Web, and they even have access to Taunt and Thunderbolt to stop common Defog users. Pawniard can also discourage the use of Defog with its ability Defiant, giving it a +2 Attack boost when it switches into Defog. An offensive Stealth Rock user, such as Golem, can provide Stealth Rock support, which is useful to wear down foes for the team while threatening them offensively.</p>"

  "Luxray": {
    "overview": "<p>Luxray fits best on offensive and balanced teams as a wallbreaker and an offensive pivot due to its ability Intimidate, which allows Luxray to perform this role decently well. Intimidate is useful to lighten damage taken from physical attackers, and Guts could allow Luxray to absorb Will-O-Wisp or another non-volatile status. Its good physical movepool plus Volt Switch give it an important niche in the PU tier, despite the fact that its modest Speed is insufficient to outspeed many foes and without an Adamant nature the power loss is substantial. Even though Luxray is powerful, it's often outclassed by other offensive Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika due to its lower Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set is playable because it can defeat all relevant Defog users in the tier and take advantage of potential Scald burns to gain an Attack boost, if you use Guts. Despite the fact that there are better switch-ins for Water-type Defoggers, Luxray takes special attacks, such as Swanna and Pelipper's Scald, better when equipped with an Assault Vest. Crunch hits Gourgeist-XL significantly harder than Ice Fang and has a chance to cleanly 2HKO non-Colbur Berry variants after Stealth Rock, but it's usually not worth using over Luxray's other moves. Quick Attack can be used as a form of priority to finish off weak foes such as a Ninetales at around 30% of total HP, as well as Jumpluff and Ursaring. A Guts set with Toxic Orb and Facade is also playable. However, a Choice Band set is preferred because it gives Luxray better power right off the bat and does not require Luxray take residual damage from poison or burn. A Choice Scarf set can be used, but the Speed boost isn't too substantial, and without Choice Band, Luxray's attacking capacity is too weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Stunfisk, Marowak, and Camerupt are all capable of 1-2HKOing Luxray and prevent it from freely spamming Wild Charge.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Usually, Grass-types are pretty good checks and counters to Luxray; for example, even if Tangela has taken a lot of residual damage and can be 2HKOed by Ice Fang on the switch, it can pivot out to an ally and get its health back with Regenerator. Gourgeist-XL can switch into Wild Charge with ease and is only 3HKOed by Ice Fang; after getting in, it can heal off damage with Synthesis, cripple Luxray with Will-O-Wisp, or retaliate with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zebstrika and Raichu are faster than Luxray and Lightning Rod variants can switch in on Volt Switch or Wild Charge. However, they do have to be careful because Luxray's Superpower cleanly OHKOes both.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Checks</strong>: Faster wallbreakers such as Life Orb Ninetales, Rotom-F, and Choice Specs Chatot can OHKO or 2HKO Luxray, thus making them good offensive checks that force Luxray out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp halves Luxray's Attack, rendering it less effective, and Toxic puts a timer on Luxray. Obviously, this is a non-issue for Guts Luxray variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Despite its recoil damage, Wild Charge basically hits everything that isn't immune to it hard; it's mainly useful against Pokemon such as Pelipper and Politoed. Ice Fang provides excellent coverage with Wild Charge, hitting common Grass-types and bulky Ground-types such as Roselia and Gabite. Superpower hits Normal- and Steel-types, as well as Chinchou. Because Wild Charge, Ice Fang, and Superpower provide good coverage, Luxray can easily afford to run Volt Switch as its last move. Volt Switch lets Luxray scout for switches against disadvantageous foes, giving you momentum, so it's really useful in tandem with Intimidate, as it makes Luxray a viable pivot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and Choice Band maximize Luxray's Attack, allowing it to wallbreak as effectively as possible. An Adamant nature further boosts Luxray's attack, although a Jolly nature in conjunction with the Speed investment allows Luxray to outspeed Adamant Stoutland and Monferno. Intimidate is useful to soften up damage from physical attackers; it can be used to weaken and force out physical attackers, easing the job of revenge killers. Intimidate can also somewhat muzzle threats such as Swords Dance Leafeon and Choice Band Stoutland; while Luxray by no means counters these Pokemon, it can use Intimidate to weaken them and make them less scary. Finally, Volt Switch is just too important to Luxray's role as a bulky pivot to give up and is nice for pivoting out of Pokemon such as Tangela.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Luxray, especially when running Intimidate, should be brought in on weak attackers and other Pokemon to force them out, therefore gaining momentum. It's better to use Volt Switch against bulkier teams to wear down foes and gain momentum, but be careful when pivoting in against Defiant users, as giving them a free Attack boost is dangerous. Luxray should be used to break down walls with its powerful attacks, but don't expect it to sweep with its mediocre Speed. Also, Luxray must be used in a slow VoltTurn team, as this will allow it to safely switch into strong attackers, especially specially based ones. Even if Luxray could revenge kill many Pokemon such as Raichu and Rotom-F, it can't switch in safely against them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock setters such as Probopass and Golem make it easier for Luxray to wallbreak, especially against Raichu and Regice. Spikes setters such as Roselia are really appreciated as well. Roselia can also take advantage of opposing Tangela rather easily. Even Toxic Spikes support works, especially against bulky Ground-types. Thunder Wave support slows down foes and makes it easier for Luxray to handle them. Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Ground-type attacks, such as Jumpluff, Swanna, and Leafeon, are also good teammates because Luxray is weak to Ground. Setup sweepers such as Ninetales, Leafeon, and Jumpluff or weather sweepers such as Rain Dance Golduck are good teammates, as Luxray can help them find setup opportunities with Intimidate. Luxray fits well in VoltTurn cores, where it can be switched in safely.</p>"

  "Rampardos": {
    "overview": "<p>Rampardos is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the tier because of its base 165 Attack stat and Sheer Force, though it can also make good use of Mold Breaker to become an effective suicide lead. Rampardos's movepool allows it to hit the majority of the PU tier for super effective damage, meaning almost nothing can switch in safely. However, its terrible defensive typing coupled with its low base Speed and bulk makes it lackluster against offensive teams and easy to revenge kill. Rampardos also faces some competition as a suicide lead from Monferno and Custap Berry Golem, which can perform a very similar role. Rampardos is, however, still a usable lead, because it is able to defeat opposing Golem and Crustle easily, has terrifying power, and can stop entry hazard removal with Head Smash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake is an option over Superpower on the first set because it hits most of the same Pokemon, but does not lower Rampardos's stats, and also hits Carbink and Metang for super effective damage; however, it does not deal super effective damage to Audino and Lickilicky. Crunch can be used to destroy Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Misdreavus, Dusknoir, Dusclops, Beheeyem, Solrock, and Duosion, but Rock Slide already hits them very hard. A Choice Band set with Head Smash hits incredibly hard, but it is actually worse at wallbreaking than the Life Orb set because Rampardos cannot switch moves. It also makes Rampardos faint really fast because of Head Smash recoil coupled with its low Speed and bulk. A Choice Scarf set also presents a possibility to do much better against offensive teams, but it still fails to outspeed very fast Pokemon such as Electrode, Purugly, and Zebstrika. It is also outsped by most other Choice Scarf users and Speed-boosting setup sweepers. Double Dance or just one Swords Dance or Rock Polish could be used, but Rampardos has a hard time setting up and often does better hitting switch-ins with a powerful attack anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Most faster offensive Pokemon such as Ninetales, Leafeon, Floatzel, and Simipour are able to easily take care of Rampardos. Hyper offensive teams with a minimal amount of team members dedicated solely to being a wall render Rampardos almost useless; it is outsped and OHKOed by most offensive Pokemon in the tier and is therefore prevented from doing its job. Rampardos's Rock typing also leaves it weak to common priority moves such as Monferno's Mach Punch and Floatzel's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: FIghting-types such as Monferno and Combusken can OHKO Rampardos with their super effective STAB moves, though they cannot switch into even resisted hits.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Marowak, Stunfisk, and Golem can usually survive a hit from Rampardos and OHKO back with their super effective STAB attacks, though they have a hard time switching in safely.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Rampardos gets burned, it becomes quite useless because it cannot wallbreak anymore. Common Will-O-Wisp users it should watch out for are Misdreavus, Gourgeist-XL, and the less common Ninetales and Solrock. Rampardos also does not like paralysis and poison, albeit to a lesser extent, because they make it easy for Rampardos to be revenge killed or worn down, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Water-types</strong>: Physically defensive Water-types such as Politoed and Prinplup can take a hit and smack Rampardos with their super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Pokemon such as Floatzel and Basculin can also check it with Aqua Jet. However, none of them like switching into Rampardos because they still take a sizeable amount of damage from its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Leads</strong>: Faster leads that carry Taunt such as Monferno can prevent the suicide lead Rampardos from setting up Stealth Rock, thus preventing it from doing its job. They can also set up their own entry hazards against it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide hits very hard when boosted by Sheer Force and Life Orb. Superpower causes Rampardos to take Life Orb damage and lowers its stats, but has good coverage against Rock- and Steel-types such as Golem, Probopass, and Pawniard as well as Audino and Lickilicky. Zen Headbutt hits Fighting-types such as Monferno, which would otherwise be solid checks to Rampardos. In the fourth moveslot, Ice Beam is preferred because it allows Rampardos to break through some physical walls such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL; however, Fire Blast generally hits all Grass-types harder. Head Smash can be used over Rock Slide as Rampardos's STAB move because it hits much harder, but it makes Rampardos even easier to revenge kill and makes it faint very fast due to recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized Speed EVs allow Rampardos to outspeed all walls in the tier as well as some slower offensive Pokemon such as Marowak and Golem. Maximized Attack investment makes Rampardos hit as hard as possible, and the leftover 4 EVs go into Special Attack to make Ice Beam or Fire Blast hit slightly harder. A Naive nature is preferred to outspeed Adamant Pawniard and Flareon. A Naughty nature is, however, definitely viable because this set is primarily a wallbreaker. The lower Speed with a Naughty nature can be troublesome, though, because it makes Rampardos slower than almost all offensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably Pawniard. This, when combined with its low bulk, means Rampardos does not like moving last and taking a hit every time it attacks. Life Orb makes Rampardos hit harder and works great with Sheer Force because the recoil is negated when Rampardos uses moves with secondary effects. Sheer Force increases the power of attacks with secondary effects, increasing Rampardos's wallbreaking potential.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rampardos is best used early- or mid-game to break through walls for teammates such as Leafeon and Pawniard so that they can clean up. This set often lures in physical walls such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, which can be beaten by Ice Beam or Fire Blast. Predicting the switch is crucial because Rampardos fails to OHKO them and thus needs to 2HKO on the switch. Rampardos is quite slow and frail, so avoid taking unnecessary damage by switching into attacks because it will often end up moving last. Coupled with Life Orb recoil and its bad defensive typing, Rampardos can find it hard lasting long against offensive teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock or Spikes support is appreciated to break Golem and Avalugg's Sturdy and help get easier OHKOs overall. Pokemon that can provide this support include Stunfisk, Roselia, and Probopass, among others. Sticky Web support from Smeargle or Leavanny is useful to allow Rampardos to outspeed many more Pokemon and actually be useful against offensive teams. Physical sweepers that appreciate physical walls getting weakened or removed, such as Pawniard, Leafeon, and Stoutland, can clean up after Rampardos has done its job. Pokemon such as Basculin, Raichu, and Kingler also appreciate Rampardos luring in Grass-types and defeating them with Ice Beam or Fire Blast. Because of its low Speed and bulk, Rampardos appreciates free switches provided by Volt Switch from Raichu, Zebstrika, or Rotom-F, and U-turn from Ninjask and Monferno. It can also be brought in after a teammate has fainted.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a useful entry hazard that breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy and forces the foe to take damage every time they switch. Superpower defeats Probopass, preventing the opponent from getting up their own Stealth Rock. Head Smash hits incredibly hard coming from a base 165 Attack stat and prevents Rapid Spin and Defog if recoil causes Rampardos to faint. With Mold Breaker and 112 Special Attack EVs, Surf OHKOes the standard lead Golem, which is quite useful for preventing the opponent from getting up Stealth Rock and can also get around Sturdy + Weakness Policy combinations. Endeavor can be used together with Focus Sash to bring the foe down to 1 HP, but most of the time Rampardos should just use Head Smash because it does a lot of damage while stopping entry hazard removal and providing momentum for Rampardos's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized Speed EVs make Rampardos outspeed Adamant Pawniard and Flareon. 112 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO with Surf on standard Golem, and the leftover EVs go into Attack to make Head Smash and Superpower hit harder. A Naive nature is used to boost Rampardos's Speed stat without lowering its Special Attack. Focus Sash ensures that Rampardos lives one attack and can get up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a suicide lead, which means Rampardos can faint as long as it has done its job. Having Stealth Rock up for consistent residual damage is worth losing Rampardos for. If the opponent leads with a Marowak, it is advised to just go for Stealth Rock instead of going for the 2HKO with Surf, because if you predict wrongly, Bonemerang makes quick work of Rampardos. The same applies if the opponent leads with Floatzel or Basculin, because both can bring Rampardos down to its Focus Sash and easily finish it off with Aqua Jet. Take full advantage of Mold Breaker to defeat opposing Golem on the first turn, as Golem can be a very annoying Pokemon to play against for offensive teams with suicide leads.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir are good teammates because they can prevent Stealth Rock from being removed by Rapid Spin from Cryogonal, Avalugg, or Armaldo. Similarly, Pokemon with the ability Defiant such as Purugly and Pawniard can discourage the foe from using Defog, as it would give them a +2 Attack boost. This set should only be used as a lead for offensive teams. Strong sweepers such as Leafeon, Pawniard, Kingler, and Huntail are good teammates. They appreciate Rampardos's ability to lay down Stealth Rock and deal a great deal of damage with Head Smash while giving you momentum so they can set up or attack. They can also provide a large amount of offensive pressure, which means Rampardos's foes will have a hard time getting rid of Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Bastiodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Bastiodon is heavily outclassed by Probopass as a bulky Stealth Rock setter and as a utility Pokemon due to its lack of momentum without Volt Switch and passive nature. Bastiodon has a slight niche with access to Roar, but that is its only upper hand, and it tends to be outclassed in every other way. Bastiodon has very good defensive stats, but its typing leaves it extremely vulnerable to Ground- and Fighting-type moves, which are pretty common in the PU metagame. Bastiodon has a varied movepool, but it doesn't have the offensive stats or Speed necessary to use it well. With its Rock / Steel typing, it is one of the only walls in the tier not affected by poison damage, but it has no recovery, barring Leftovers, and can be easily worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bastiodon can utilize Protect to scout a foe for super effective moves as well as to stall out a foe if they have a status condition. It can also use Heavy Slam as a way to deal damage against Pokemon such as Carbink and Clefairy and to prevent itself from being completely useless if taunted. Bastiodon can also run an Air Balloon to dodge Ground-type moves before taking a hit, but it loses out on much needed recovery, and the item itself is gimmicky. Taunt can also be used by Bastiodon, but it is too slow to be able to pull it off as well as Pokemon such as Misdreavus or Grumpig. Bastiodon can use Metal Burst in combination with Sturdy, but it will lose one of its much needed moves. Metal Burst is also a pretty bad gimmick with a low success rate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Monferno</strong>: Monferno can use Bastiodon as setup fodder or simply OHKO it with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Camerupt, Golem, Gabite, and Stunfisk can all hit Bastiodon with a 4x super effective Ground-type move while Bastiodon can do little in return.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Pawniard, Klang, and Probopass can completely wall Bastiodon. Pawniard and Klang can deal some hefty damage to it with Knock Off and Gear Grind, respectively, and Probopass can trap it with Magnet Pull and KO with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Politoed, Floatzel, Simipour, and Golduck can deal massive amounts of damage to Bastiodon. Floatzel and Simipour can Taunt and cripple it as well, and Golduck can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Dodrio, and Grumpig can Taunt and force Bastiodon to switch out or use Struggle, but they need to avoid a Magic Coat, as it can cripple them instead. Other Pokemon with Taunt, such as Simipour and Floatzel, can also deal massive damage with their Water-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Pokemon such as Armaldo, Vullaby, Swanna, Vibrava, and Prinplup can remove Bastiodon's entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin. Although Bastiodon has the ability to wear them down with Toxic, most have reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Mr. Mime, Kadabra, Ursaring, Misdreavus, Stoutland, Regice, and Raichu can deal massive amounts of damage to Bastiodon with their coverage moves, from Raichu's, Mr. Mime's, and Regice's Focus Blast to Stoutland's Superpower.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock can offer chip damage to foes on the switch, break Focus Sashes, and severely injure some Pokemon upon switching in, such as Ninjask and Articuno. Toxic is Bastiodon's only way to inflict damage, and it can be very effective in either breaking down walls or weakening a foe to the point where a teammate can revenge kill it. Roar is very useful for phazing Pokemon that are attempting to set up as well as for switching the active foe out, forcing the opponent to send in a more favorable match up. Magic Coat allows Bastiodon to bounce back status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Defense and HP with a Careful nature allows Bastiodon to take on dangerous threats such as Ninetales, Zebstrika, Rotom-F, Tangela, Roselia, and other special attackers. A physically defensive set with a Bold nature could be used, but it has more special weaknesses, while investment in Defense doesn't help it as much. Leftovers gives Bastiodon a bit of health back each turn, which is important, as it doesn't receive a recovery move. Sturdy allows Bastiodon to survive a singular hit from full health, which can be key in situations when it is trying to get Stealth Rock up or when it needs to Roar out a Pokemon that is trying to sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Just because Bastiodon has Stealth Rock doesn't mean it will always be the Pokemon you will lead with. Don't solely rely on Bastiodon to take on a lot of threats to your team, because it can get weakened quickly. Because it lacks a recovery move, you shouldn't consistently switch it into attacks. In addition, Bastiodon needs to fear coverage moves on foes such as Mr. Mime and Misdreavus. If you can, attempt to preserve Sturdy for late-game as a last resort against setup sweepers. Use Magic Coat only when you are certain the foe is going to use a status move. Attempt to set up Stealth Rock early-game to allow it to have the largest impact on the opposing team as possible, and Toxic can be spammed early-game to weaken foes as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bastiodon works best on balanced or stall teams in which its teammates can counteract foes that beat it; these teams also appreciate Bastiodon's entry hazard support. Bastiodon works well with Pokemon that can counteract Fighting- and Ground-type moves, such as Clefairy, Arbok, and Jumpluff. Bastiodon also appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Steel-types, such as Monferno, Ninetales, and Rapidash. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Dusknoir, Gourgeist-XL, and Misdreavus can block incoming Rapid Spins and keep Bastiodon's Stealth Rock up; their immunity to Fighting-type moves is also beneficial. Bulky Grass-types such as Roselia, Tangela, and Gourgeist-XL can take both Water- and Ground-type moves. Wish passers such as Audino allow Bastiodon to recover HP and stay on the field longer. Spikes setters such as Roselia and Quilladin can set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes, and they allow Bastiodon to get more damage on a foe when using Roar.</p> <p>Pawniard and Purugly, while both sharing Bastiodon's Fighting-type weakness, are very good partners, as they can discourage the use of Defog from the foe and maintain Bastiodon's entry hazard with Defiant. In addition, Pokemon who use Stealth Rock to their advantage, such as Mr. Mime, Sawsbuck, Arbok, Kingler, Articuno, and Ursaring, appreciate Bastiodon on their team to deal with the opponent's team better.</p>"

  "Mothim": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite having access to a solid ability in Tinted Lens and STAB moves in Bug Buzz and Air Slash, Mothim is mediocre in PU. It also has access to Quiver Dance, but it is outclassed by Butterfree in this regard. Mothim can function as a decent Choice Specs user; however, this is also done better by Butterfree due to its slightly higher Speed stat. Mothim's horrible defenses and bad Bug / Flying typing, which gives it weaknesses to common attacking types and a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, make it almost impossible for Mothim to set up and limit its chances to wallbreak. It's outclassed by other special wallbreakers such as Simipour, which are faster and are not hampered by Stealth Rock, and its below-average Speed means that it can easily be taken out by faster Pokemon such as Stoutland.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quiver Dance can turn Mothim into a decent special sweeper, but it is outclassed in this role by Butterfree, which has access to Sleep Powder to allow it to set up easier. Life Orb can be used over Choice Specs to allow Mothim to switch moves, but the recoil wears it down fast and makes it easier to revenge kill. Sleep Talk lets Mothim act as a sleep absorber against Pokemon such as Tangela and retaliate with either of its STAB attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock takes half of Mothim's health every time it switches in, making it difficult for it to function. Examples of Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock and KO Mothim include Golem and Rampardos.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good special bulk such as Audino, Clefairy, and Regice can easily take any of Mothim's attacks and either cripple it with status or outright OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, Ninetales, and Monferno can easily outspeed and KO Mothim with their respective STAB attacks, but they can't switch in on it, as Tinted Lens Bug Buzz does a lot of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mothim has below-average Speed, so faster Pokemon such as Stoutland and Simipour can easily OHKO it, though they cannot switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Mothim's defenses are very bad, making it easily picked off by priority attacks from the likes of Pawniard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is Mothim's main STAB attack, hitting a good portion of the metagame for respectable damage. Air Slash is Mothim's secondary STAB move, hitting Pokemon such as Roselia harder than Bug Buzz. Hidden Power Ground allows Mothim to hit Probopass harder than any of its other moves. U-turn gives Mothim a way to gain momentum by pivoting out of matchups that aren't in its favor and on predicted switches to counters such as Audino.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack along with a Rash nature allows Mothim to deal out the most damage it can. Maximum investment in Speed is necessary to help Mothim strike first when possible, as it has trouble handling counterattacks. A Naive nature can be used to outspeed neutral-natured maximum Speed base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Mightyena, but it generally isn't worth the loss in power. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack rather than HP to give Mothim an odd HP number and allow it to switch into Stealth Rock twice. Choice Specs provides a boost to Mothim's Special Attack at the cost of locking it into a move. Tinted Lens gives a boost to Mothim's attacks if they are not very effective against the foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Mothim has terrible defenses, low Speed, and a bad typing, it should avoid switching in on attacks; it is best coming in through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Pelipper. Mothim is best used as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker, using its moves to punch holes in the opponent's team. Mothim should mainly spam its STAB attacks, as there aren't many Pokemon that resist both, thanks to Tinted Lens. Mothim should avoid using U-turn often if Stealth Rock is up, but U-turn can be used against Pokemon that can withstand its attacks such as Clefairy and Regice. Try to avoid sending in Mothim with entry hazards up, as it is much easier for the foe to pick it off when it is in a weakened state.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mothim should be used on offensive teams, as it can't function on any other type of team due to its poor typing and low Speed. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Armaldo, Vibrava, and Pelipper is mandatory, as Stealth Rock easily wears down Mothim. Sticky Web and paralysis support from Pokemon such as Leavanny and Grumpig is greatly appreciated to make up for Mothim's low Speed. If Sticky Web support is used, a Timid nature should be run on Mothim to outspeed Pokemon such as Floatzel and Zebstrika. Mothim also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roselia, Probopass, and Golem, as the residual damage wears down foes, making it easier for Mothim to wallbreak. For example, Stealth Rock support guarantees the OHKO on physically defensive Pelipper and Rapidash and the 2HKO on defensive Misdreavus with Tinted Lens Bug Buzz. Golem in particular makes for a great partner, as it is immune to Electric-type attacks and can handle opposing Rock-types for Mothim. Pokemon such as Raichu and Zebstrika can form a VoltTurn core with Mothim to keep up momentum. Fighting-types such as Monferno can deal with Rock- and Ice-types for Mothim. Setup sweepers such as Regice appreciate Mothim's wallbreaking support. Mixed variants of Simipour can take out special walls that Mothim has trouble dealing with, such as Audino and Regice.</p>"

  "Vespiquen": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its high defensive stats, Vespiquen is a terrible wall, as its typing provides multiple common weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. This leaves it outclassed by Pokemon such as Pelipper, which not only has a better typing but also provides support with Defog. Vespiquen also struggles offensively due to average offensive stats and horrible Speed. Although Tailwind somewhat patches up its low Speed and Destiny Bond allows it to get a surprise KO, both of these are hard to pull off due to Vespiquen's poor defensive typing and the move's predictability, respectively. It is also easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Raichu and Sawsbuck. Other Pokemon such as Gorebyss and Ninjask are better cleaners, as they are not limited on turns and are stronger, and Pelipper is better at supporting a team with Tailwind.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky set with Defend Order, Toxic, and Roost could be used as a slow sweeper; however, even with several boosts, Vespiquen takes a lot from super effective attacks, and the set is stopped by a critical hit. Vespiquen could run a specially defensive set to check Grass-types such as Tangela and Roselia, but its many weaknesses mean that it can only check a few Pokemon. A set running Custap Berry with Destiny Bond and Hidden Power Ground or Power Gem to hit Fire-types and either Probopass or Flying-types can also get a surprised KO, but it is easily KOed when outside of Custap Berry range. A set running Attack Order and Acrobatics without an item could be used to bait in special walls, but such a set's inability to make use of an item leaves Vespiquen walled by physically bulky Pokemon such as Golem and Gabite.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Stunfisk, Probopass, Clefairy, and Lickilicky can easily take any hit, recover off the damage, and paralyze Vespiquen to avoid mind games with Destiny Bond. Clefairy can also freely set up with Calm Mind, while Probopass can set up Stealth Rock with ease.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to its low Speed and many weaknesses, the best way to stop Vespiquen is by KOing it before it has set up, which can easily be done by strong Pokemon such as Stoutland, Raichu, and Rapidash. Choice Scarf users such as Sawsbuck, Mr. Mime, and Dodrio can all revenge kill Vespiquen even if Tailwind has been set up.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Probopass resists both Vespiquen's STAB moves and can set up Stealth Rock and weaken it with Volt Switch; however, this does not KO even after Stealth Rock. Klang also resists its STAB moves and can set up with Shift Gear and Rest off any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Vespiquen is easily worn down by Life Orb recoil along with Stealth Rock, which takes off half of its HP. However, it should be noted that this damage can help Vespiquen score a KO with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Rapidash, Monferno, and Simisear can survive a hit and KO Vespiquen or outspeed it if Tailwind is not set up. Ninetales's high special bulk allows it to set up with Nasty Plot and stall out Destiny Bond with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic and burns from Pokemon such as Politoed and Misdreavus not only wear Vespiquen down, but they also can KO it while bypassing Destiny Bond. Paralysis from Stunfisk and Clefairy leaves Vespiquen easily revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Because Vespiquen is easily worn down, strong priority moves such as Dusknoir's Shadow Sneak, Pawniard's Sucker Punch, and Floatzel's Aqua Jet can revenge kill Vespiquen.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tailwind doubles Vespiquen's team's Speed for several turns, allowing it to outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon in PU while also providing team support. Bug Buzz is Vespiquen's strongest STAB move, and Air Slash provides a secondary STAB and a way to hit Fighting-, Flying-, and Fire-types such as Monferno, Pelipper, and Rapidash. Destiny Bond allows Vespiquen to get a surprise KO on a foe it cannot KO when weakened. Targets include Ninetales, Probopass, and Pelipper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Vespiquen to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Vespiquen to outspeed Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Floatzel under Tailwind. The last 4 EVs are not placed into HP so Vespiquen can switch into Stealth Rock twice and still survive. Life Orb increases Vespiquen's power significantly but inflicts recoil, which, when combined with Stealth Rock damage, severely limits its longevity; however, it can be helpful with Destiny Bond. Alternatively, Insect Plate only boosts Vespiquen's main STAB move but does not have any negative effects. Pressure is used because it is Vespiquen's most relevant ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vespiquen should be used either late-game to try to clean up or early- to mid-game to provide wallbreaking teammates with support or take out a threatening foe. It should avoid switching in on anything if Stealth Rock is set up and should be brought in after a KO or by a slow pivot; however, it can switch in on Pokemon that it walls, such as Tangela. Tailwind should be set up on Pokemon Vespiquen walls or forces out, such as Tangela and Grumpig. Destiny Bond should only be used when Vespiquen is definitely going to be KOed, and it should be kept hidden to try to surprise the opponent. Vespiquen should be also careful of the opponent switching around their Pokemon to try stalling out Tailwind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vespiquen greatly appreciates entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Vibrava and Armaldo, as otherwise it loses half its health to Stealth Rock. Conversely, entry hazards from Pokemon such as Metang and Roselia help weaken the opposing team for Vespiquen to possibly clean. Ground-types such as Gabite and Stunfisk can provide entry hazard support while also checking Electric- and Steel-types that threaten Vespiquen, whereas Rock-types such as Golem and Probopass also provide entry hazards and can check Fire- and Flying-type. Grumpig and Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour, all of which also appreciate Tailwind support, check Fire- and Ice-types, and Grumpig can switch in more easily due to its superior bulk. Wallbreakers such as Simipour and Simisage can weaken the opponent's team to the point where Vespiquen might be able to clean. Vespiquen only works on offensive teams, especially with slower wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Mawile, which appreciate Tailwind support.</p>"

One may wonder why it isn't in a higher tier, because it clearly is good at what it does and can threaten opponents to dropped jaws in amazement at how it can takes so many hits and continue to keep on coming back for more. Huh? You thought I was talking about Pikachu? What's wrong with you, this isn't the anime. It's all about the lovable Generation IV rodent known as Pachirisu, which rose to fame by helping Se Jun Park win the 2014 VGC World Championships in the Masters Division. However, while it may play a role in doubles, singles is another story, and with terrible offenses, Pachirisu has to hope that being cute will be enough for it to last.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you want to maximize Pachirisu's cuteness, you could opt for moves such as Growl, Sweet Kiss, Flatter, Charm, and Fake Tears, as any opponent would feel bad for attacking such a adorable creature. If Rock- and Ground-types want to get up in Pachirisu's face, Grass Knot will make them think twice before doing that because while it's one thing to attack something this adorable, it's another to piss it off. If you want to show Raichu and Zebstrika who's the superior Electric-type in the tier, a specially defensive spread with a Calm nature allows Pachirisu to do just that. If you want your squirrel to be cute and cool at the same time, Assault Vest will do the trick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Camerupt, Golem, and other Ground-types don't care how cute Pachirisu is, because one Earthquake is all it takes for the electric squirrel to go down.</p> <p><strong>Fully Evolved Pokemon</strong>: Take your pick. Ursaring, Stoutland, Rapidash. All can 2HKO Pachirisu with their moves, but they do fear paralysis or being inflicted with rabies, er, I mean Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>As if it weren't adorable enough, Pachirisu has access to Nuzzle â€” because nothing says \"threatening\" like having a electric squirrel rub against your cheeks and leave you immobile. And if it ever feels frightened, it could always U-turn out to something that can beat up the scary Ground-types that want to hurt it. However, Pachirisu can get vicious if it wants to, and with the combination of Toxic + Super Fang, it can do just that.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment increases Pachirisu's bulk to take physical hits better. Leftovers is the preferred item, as Pachirisu has no reliable form of recovery, and it does look cute when its munching away at an apple. Volt Absorb gives Pachirisu recovery when it is hit by an Electric-type attack and is preferred over its other abilities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Other than being a cute bundle of sheer annoyance, Pachirisu's main objective is to spread status around with Nuzzle and Toxic. If a predicted Electric-type attack is imminent, feel free to switch the squirrel in and watch your opponent's dismay as their attempts to hurt Pachirisu get denied.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If you're building with Pachirisu, keep in mind two things: 1. that it needs Water- and Grass-types such as Simipour and Tangela to take care of opposing Ground-types and 2. you're better off going with a better Electric-type. If you insist on using this for whatever reason other than cuteness, wallbreakers that appreciate faster threats slowed down by Nuzzle, such as Ursaring and Stoutland, make for good partners.</p>"

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Floatzel is one of the premier offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its high offensive stats, great Speed, and very expansive coverage combined with high unpredictability make it a great option on balanced and offensive teams. It can function as both a wallbreaker and cleaner, can run physical or special sets, has support options and priority, and can function as an effective mixed attacking lure. This, combined with the lack of Pokemon that resist its moves, makes it an incredibly potent attacker. Its few drawbacks are being slower than only the common Zebstrika and somewhat rarer Electrode and Ninjask and its occasionally underwhelming power and slightly weak coverage options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Floatzel is a highly effective Choice Scarf user, being only three points slower than Choice Scarf Simipour and Simisage and slightly stronger than Simipour with a Modest nature. Physical variants are possible, but the better coverage of special sets makes them more effective at revenge killing. Choice Band Floatzel has several more niche attacking options such as Iron Tail for Avalugg and Clefairy and Low Kick for Stoutland and Bouffalant, but they tend to be mostly outclassed by its regular moves in terms of coverage. Agility, Rain Dance, or Tailwind can boost Floatzel's Speed to sweep, but such sets are generally done better by Golduck or Gorebyss, although Rain Dance sets can function on full rain teams. Aqua Jet can be run in the fourth slot of the special Life Orb set with a Hasty nature to provide extra priority and occasionally catch foes off-guard as well. Offensive Bulk Up sets can also attempt to sweep, although they face competition from other Water-type sweepers such as Relicanth and Gorebyss and should only be used if Floatzel's immediate Speed is desperately needed over the other two. Power-Up Punch is also a usable option, foregoing the defense boost for the ability to KO weakened foes and boost Floatzel's Attack simultaneously. Ice Beam can be run on physical sets to lure and KO physically defensive Grass-types in a similar manner to Ice Punch on special Floatzel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Water</strong>: As Floatzel generally prefers to run Choice sets, Water Absorb Politoed and Lapras make it difficult for Floatzel to effectively spam its STAB attacks. It can deal significant damage to them by predicting the switch and using Return or Hidden Power Electric, but this makes Floatzel far more pressured to wallbreak efficiently.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types can take on Floatzel depending on which set it is running. Specially defensive Roselia is an excellent switch-in for special Floatzel sets, although it will lose to physical ones. Similarly, Quilladin, Tangela, and Gourgeist-XL take little from a physical Ice Punch but cannot switch into special Floatzel's Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: All Electric-types are obviously capable of OHKOing Floatzel with their super effective STAB moves. Floatzel is also slower than Zebstrika, Electrode, and Choice Scarf Electric-types such as Rotom-F and Raichu and can be lured and KOed by Passho Berry Stunfisk.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: PU has a large amount of bulky Pokemon capable of taking a hit from Floatzel and crippling it with status or simply KOing it. Assault Vest Bouffalant is an excellent check to the special set, while other bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy, Regice, and Relicanth can check both sets.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Floatzel's poor bulk, all Pokemon faster than Floatzel can at least 2HKO it or revenge kill it with only a little prior damage. Although it is only slower than Electrode, Ninjask, and Zebstrika unboosted, it can also be threatened by Choice Scarf users and outsped when Sticky Web is up.</p>",

Ice Beam gives great coverage with Hydro Pump, covering the Grass-types that resist Floatzel's Water-type moves, such as Tangela, Jumpluff, and the ubiquitous Roselia, although it falls just short of the 2HKO on defensive variants. Hidden Power Electric covers the few Pokemon that resist Floatzel's other two moves, most notably Water-types. These include Swanna, Politoed, and Lapras, which take very little from Ice Beam. The final slot depends on personal preference. Surf provides an accurate STAB option in order to safely KO Pokemon in a late-game scenario. Switcheroo is to be used with Choice Specs only; it enables Floatzel to cripple some of its sturdier counters, such as Clefairy. Focus Blast can be run to 2HKO Assault Vest Bouffalant on the switch, as well as netting the OHKO on Stoutland and doing more damage to Lapras. Taunt can be used to cripple walls such as Clefairy trying to recover health or cripple Floatzel with status. Finally, Ice Punch can be run on Life Orb sets with a Naive nature in order to lure and 2HKO Roselia.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is used to allow Floatzel to wallbreak and clean up more efficiently. A Timid nature allows Floatzel to outspeed a plethora of barely slower attackers thanks to its excellent base Speed, including Jumpluff and Rapidash. Water Veil, while having much less merit on this set than physical variations, is still beneficial occasionally to prevent burn damage. Life Orb is generally the preferred item, as it allows Floatzel to switch up moves and opens up options such as Ice Punch and Taunt, but Choice Specs is also run to increase Floatzel's power and allow it to effectively use Switcheroo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep bringing Floatzel in a lot, as it pressures opposing teams a ton and can easily rack up KOs with repeated attacks. If facing a team with a Pokemon immune to Water such as Politoed, avoid locking Floatzel into a Water-type attack if possible. Floatzel is generally used to revenge kill slower threats, which constitute most of the metagame, while making it hard for the opponent to try to preserve those threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Floatzel will generally be run on more offensive teams that need a strong attacker as well as extra speed control to fare better versus opposing offense teams. Pokemon that can check Zebstrika, Electrode, and Ninjask are useful, as they are the only unboosted threats capable of outspeeding and KOing Floatzel. Stunfisk is the most notable example that checks all three. Setup sweepers such as Fraxure that can struggle with bulkier teams appreciate Floatzel's ability to cripple opposing walls to more easily sweep late-game. Both Stealth Rock setters such as Probopass and Spikes setters such as Roselia can help wear down Floatzel switch-ins such as Bouffalant more quickly. Pokemon such as Arbok and Dodrio that can pressure Roselia are greatly appreciated, as Floatzel can have a lot of trouble breaking past specially defensive variants.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is Floatzel's most reliable attack, and it is used most often to clean late-game once the foes that resist it have been KOed or weakened. Ice Punch is for Grass-types such as Gogoat, Simisage, and especially Roselia, which like to switch in on special Floatzel. Aqua Jet is a tool to revenge kill weakened, faster Pokemon such as Zebstrika, Choice Scarf Chatot, and other Pokemon offense struggles with. The last move is entirely based on team support options. Return 2HKOes Politoed and Lumineon, which otherwise completely wall Floatzel. Switcheroo cripples Tangela as well as Floatzel's other counters somewhat, though Tangela is the main one that is crippled by only Switcheroo. Pursuit is usable as well to force damage on some of the Pokemon that want to switch from Floatzel, although it has very limited use, as Floatzel generally does not force out Pokemon weak to Dark.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band and maximum Attack investment keep Floatzel hitting hard, while maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed as much as possible when cleaning. Water Veil gives a handy immunity to Scald burns as well as the ability to switch into predicted Will-O-Wisps.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Floatzel will typically be used to lure whichever Pokemon is crippled or KOed by the move it carries in the last slot, such as Politoed for Return variants, before sweeping late-game. The same applies when using this just to lure Pokemon such as Clefairy, Roselia, and Grumpig, which are all good switch-ins to special Floatzel variants but are KOed by physical sets. Use Aqua Jet against lead Golem to beat both Custap Berry and Sucker Punch variants. Floatzel should also be preserved when facing a problematic setup sweeper to act as a final line of defense with Aqua Jet.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A secondary Water-type such as Simipour goes well with Floatzel, as it forces in and can cripple or KO most Water checks, although the shared weakness forces the team to prepare more for Grass- and Electric-types. Depending on which move it carries, Floatzel needs checks to the Pokemon it fails to cover, such as Roselia to set Spikes on Politoed or Tangela. Pawniard, Knock Off Purugly, or other Tangela lures work nicely for Floatzel to clean more easily.</p>"

  "Drifblim": {
    "overview": "<p>Drifblim's decent Attack stat combined with a good offensive typing and an excellent ability in Unburden makes it an effective sweeper in the PU metagame. However, its sweeping potential is severely limited by the lack of a physical boosting move, strong STAB moves and coverage, and ways for it to activate Unburden. It is easily walled, as physical sets struggle to get past Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types, and special sets are too weak to break through common special walls. Drifblim can be revenge killed easily, as it is weak to three common priority moves, and certain Choice Scarf users such as Raichu will outspeed Drifblim even if it has an Unburden boost. It has a decent support movepool including Will-O-Wisp, Knock Off, and Destiny Bond, which provide team support and can help it sweep. Drifblim's high HP stat is let down by poor Defense and Special Defense and a typing that leaves it weak to five common types and to Stealth Rock. Although it has the potential to spinblock, it cannot do so in practice, as it loses to every relevant Rapid Spin user. Unburden provides Drifblim with a niche over other offensive Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, allowing it to be more effective against offensive teams, as it is harder to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flame Orb combined with Flare Boost could be used for more immediate power, but Drifblim is slow and still weak. Drifblim has a range of support moves including Magic Coat, Rain Dance, and Defog; however, it lacks the bulk to make use of them. Hypnosis could be used to let Drifblim set up with more ease, but it has low accuracy. Drifblim can use Phantom Force with Power Herb to activate Unburden and have a Ghost-type STAB move, but Phantom Force can be played around once Drifblim's Power Herb has been used.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that outspeed Drifblim, such as Stoutland and Simipour, can deal heavy damage to it; however, they fail to revenge kill Drifblim if it has its Unburden boost. Choice Scarf Dodrio and Raichu both have enough Speed to outrun and KO Drifblim even after it has its Speed boosted. Many common attackers including Rotom-F and Floatzel can outrun Drifblim before Unburden is activated and either KO it or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Drifblim is weak to Sucker Punch, the most common priority attack in PU, so users such as Cacturne, Pawniard, and Mawile can revenge kill Drifblim; however, Sucker Punch users have to predict around Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. Other strong priority moves such as Floatzel's Aqua Jet can revenge kill a weakened Drifblim.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Type Advantage</strong>: Due to its mono-coverage, physically based Drifblim is easily walled by Steel- and Rock-types, such as Mawile and Golem, which can set up entry hazards on Drifblim, and the best Drifblim can respond with is by burning them. Electric-types such as Stunfisk and Rotom-F also resist Flying, although Rotom-F cannot switch directly into Drifblim safely.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon, such as Audino and Regice, can easily take any special hit and wear Drifblim down, but they have to be wary of taking a physical hit. Physically bulky Pokemon, such as Relicanth and Pelipper, can take an Acrobatics and respond by inflicting status or simply KOing Drifblim. Mixed defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg can take on Drifblim's set and wear it down with constant attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "AcroBlim": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is Drifblim's strongest STAB move, reaching 110 Base Power after Drifblim loses its item. Substitute allows Drifblim to easily activate its item while blocking status and weaker hits, and Knock Off is Drifblim's best attack versus Steel- and Electric-types such as Metang and Zebstrika. Will-O-Wisp allows Drifblim to cripple switchins such as Golem, although Sucker Punch is an option to beat opposing priority users such as Huntail and can allow Drifblim to 2HKO Rotom-F without Stealth Rock in conjunction with Knock Off. Destiny Bond can be used to remove foes that otherwise wall Drifblim.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs let Drifblim outrun Choice Scarf Leafeon and everything slower after Unburden, as well as outspeeding threats such as Pawniard before its Speed boost. Maximum Attack EV investment and an Adamant nature are required in order to give Drifblim the capability to sweep. The leftover EVs are used to increase Drifblim's defensive stats, with the current spread being the most effective and allowing Drifblim to consume its Liechi Berry after three Substitutes. Liechi Berry activates Unburden, which lets Drifblim outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, and provides a power boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drifblim should be used as a late-game sweeper when Pokemon that resist Flying-type moves and Choice Scarf and priority users have been removed, but it can also be used before that just to spread burns or cripple foes with Knock Off. Drifblim should not be switched in but rather should enter after a teammate is KOed or brought in from a pivot against Pokemon that Drifblim can force out such as Monferno and Roselia. When in and ready to sweep, Drifblim should either try to Substitute until it is in range of the activation of one of its Berries or use Will-O-Wisp to prevent the foe from dealing too much damage. Once it Drifblim has its Unburden boost with Liechi Berry, attacking will often be the best play, as Drifblim might be too weak to take even an attack from a burned Pokemon; however, when running Sitrus Berry, Drifblim will have enough health to more comfortably take a hit. Drifblim should try to not reveal Destiny Bond, as it is more effective if the opponent does not expect it. Similarly, Sucker Punch can be used to surprise weakened foes expecting to be able to outspeed and KO Drifblim before its Unburden boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its limited coverage, Drifblim should be paired with a teammate that can check Pokemon that resist Flying. This includes Water-type Pokemon, such as Floatzel and Simipour, which beat Rock- and Ice-types; Grass-types, such as Simisage and Tangela, which resist Electric-types and check Rock-types; and Ground-types, such as Gabite and Golem, which beat Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Drifblim appreciates entry hazard removal support from Pokemon such as Prinplup. Dark- and Normal-types such as Pawniard and Stoutland beat opposing Ghost-types while Drifblim checks Fighting-types. Fighting- and Steel-types such as Monferno and Probopass beat Ice-types; the former can also beat Dark- and Steel-types, and the latter checks Rock-types. Other Flying-types such as Jumpluff can form Flying-type spam cores, as they weaken each other's checks and counters. Wallbreakers, such as Leafeon and Mawile, and entry hazards from Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Smeargle wear the opposing team down, providing Drifblim with a better chance to sweep. Drifblim fits better on offensive teams, which provide enough offensive pressure to wear down the opponent's team and remove possible threats.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind makes Drifblim significantly stronger and provides setup opportunities against special attackers. Shadow Ball is Drifblim's main STAB move, and Hidden Power Fighting provides perfect coverage by hitting Normal- and Dark-types, as well as Probopass. Rest recovers lost health and, in combination with Chesto Berry, activates Drifblim's Unburden. Thunderbolt can be used as a secondary coverage move to hit Water- and Flying-types harder, especially Vullaby, while also hitting Pokemon that resist Ghost, but for less damage than Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs allow Drifblim to outrun base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Mightyena before Unburden, and maximum Special Attack EV investment and a Modest nature boost Drifblim's power, allowing it to sweep more easily. The remaining EVs go into Drifblim's HP and defenses, with the given spread being the most efficient. Chesto Berry allows Drifblim to immediately wake up from Rest while activating Unburden, which lets Drifblim outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drifblim is best used as a late-game sweeper after the opposing team has been worn down; however, it can still be used as a mid-game wallbreaker. It should only try to sweep if faster Choice Scarf and priority users have been removed, as it can only set up once in a game. Drifblim should try to set up against a Pokemon it walls, such as Vibrava, or a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Duosion or Tangela. It prefers to be switched in after a teammate is KOed or from a pivot, due to its average bulk. When in, using Calm Mind is often the best play. Drifblim should only attack if it will not be able to sweep at the time but possibly later. Rest should be used when Drifblim is either low on health or when it needs to outspeed certain Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drifblim should be used on offensive teams which can weaken the foe to allow Drifblim to sweep. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Drifblim appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog users such as Armaldo as teammates. Drifblim greatly appreciates wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Mr. Mime in order to weaken the opposing team to the point where Drifblim can sweep. Entry hazard setters such as Venipede and Golem are also appreciated in wearing the opposing team down and allowing Drifblim to get KOs on Pokemon such as Stoutland. Ground- and Grass-types such as Gabite and Roselia beat Electric- and Rock-types that threaten Drifblim. Dark-types such as Zweilous and Mightyena beat opposing Ghost-types, and Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard beat Ice- and Rock-types and can set up entry hazards.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Lopunny carves a small niche in the tier thanks to the combination of Klutz + Switcheroo, allowing it to cripple physically defensive switch-ins and physical attackers by giving them a Flame Orb. It is also very fast, outspeeding a good portion of the tier. However, Lopunny is outclassed offensively by Stoutland and Bouffalant due to their hitting harder, as well as Purugly, which is faster. Defensively, Audino has superior bulk and a wider movepool, and Mr. Mime overshines Lopunny as a Healing Wish user due to its greater offensive presence. Lopunny is also very frail, which makes it hard to switch into even neutral hits. Even though its Speed is great, it is outsped by Pokemon such as Raichu and Zebstrika as well as some Choice Scarf users, including Chatot and Mr. Mime.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lopunny can't do much without being outclassed by something else in the tier. Choice Band can be used to cripple special attackers and hit somewhat hard. However, physical attackers can switch in and increase their power if given a Choice Band, and Pokemon such as Stoutland and Bouffalant are better Choice Band attackers compared to Lopunny. Lopunny can use other utility moves, such as Encore and Thunder Wave; however, if those are used over Return or High Jump Kick, Lopunny becomes very passive, and if one is used over Healing Wish, there's little reason to use Lopunny at all. Choice Scarf can give Lopunny a very fast Healing Wish, but it is still outclassed by Mr. Mime due to a severe lack of power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, Monferno, and Simisear are immune to burns and can hit Lopunny hard with a STAB Fire-type move, leaving it unable to check what it's supposed to. However, Return will deal a decent amount of damage, meaning that they might get KOed if they don't switch in unscathed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: There aren't a whole lot of Pokemon faster than Lopunny, but the ones that are, such as Zebstrika, Floatzel, and Raichu, can KO it without the fear of being crippled by Switcheroo.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Kadabra and Mr. Mime aren't weakened by Flame Orb and can still heavily damage Lopunny. However, they are quite frail, so Return will deal quite a bit of damage to them.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Switcheroo allows Lopunny to cripple physically defensive Pokemon, such as Relicanth, Vullaby, Misdreavus, and Tangela. It can also cripple physical wallbreakers such as Armaldo, Pawniard, Dodrio, and Bouffalant. Return is Lopunny's main STAB move, while High Jump Kick allows Lopunny to at least harm Steel- and Rock-types such as Golem, Pawniard, and Probopass.  Healing Wish allows Lopunny to bring in a late-game sweeper that has no recovery, such as Swords Dance Monferno, safely and at full health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Lopunny to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed EVs take advantage of Lopunny's good Speed tier, enabling it to cripple slower Pokemon; furthermore, a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Ninetales and Naive Simipour. The power loss compared to an Adamant nature is negligible because Lopunny is fairly weak even with Attack investment. Flame Orb allows Lopunny to take advantage of Switcheroo and burn physical attackers. Klutz prevents Flame Orb from activating and burning Lopunny itself, and it can also let Lopunny bluff a Choice item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lopunny's only purpose is to cripple a foe with Switcheroo for another teammate to take advantage of it. After using Switcheroo, Lopunny is nearly dead weight, and you should just use Healing Wish to bring in a weakened teammate for free. Due to Lopunny's frailty, you should not switch it into neutral hits, as they can easily take away half of its health under most circumstances; therefore, you have to get it in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or bring it in on a Ghost-type move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Lumineon and Vullaby can provide a slow U-turn and allow Lopunny to switch in safely. Water-types, such as Floatzel and Simipour, as well as Rock-types such as Golem and Relicanth can take on Fire-types, which are immune to burns. Physical attackers and sweepers can take advantage of Lopunny burning bulky Pokemon to set up or just hit very hard, and setup sweepers appreciate Healing Wish for a second chance to set up.</p>"

  "Purugly": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the two viable users of Defiant in PU, Purugly is effective on Spikes-stacking and Sticky Web teams for its ability to discourage and punish the use of Defog. In addition, its access to multiple strong priority moves as well as its fantastic Speed make it one of the best revenge killers in PU and help it stand out from its Normal-type brethren. However, Purugly's horrible bulk and lack of resistances mean that it provides nothing defensively to a team and has trouble switching into the Defoggers it wants to take advantage of, particularly Swanna. Purugly is also a bit lacking in power if it cannot get a Defiant boost; this is not helped by the fact that it is easily walled by common Pokemon such as Golem and Probopass, which easily resist all of its moves and can set up or hit it back hard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Purugly is a decent user of Taunt thanks to its great Speed, but it lacks the room in its moveset to use it very effectively. Wake-Up Slap provides super effective coverage against Rock- and Steel-types, but its low Base Power prevents it from being too useful except against Probopass and the irrelevant Bastiodon, who can be 2HKOed. Lastly, Quick Attack is an option, but Fake Out and Sucker Punch are much more useful priority moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as defensive Pelipper and Mawile make for good stops to Purugly. Ghost-type physical walls such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL can wall Purugly if it lacks Knock Off, while Tangela can wall it as well but must be wary of Knock Off. Even if they are not usually considered physical walls, bulky Pokemon such as Armaldo, Stunfisk, and Gabite can usually take a hit from Purugly and KO it back. However, if Purugly is at +2, most of these Pokemon need to be very healthy to even hope to stand up to it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Purugly cannot hope to deal significant damage to Probopass or Mawile, and can only hope to Knock Off their item, unless it is running the uncommon Wake-Up Slap. Klang can easily set up Shift Gears against Purugly while walling it to oblivion, unless Purugly is running Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Golem and Armaldo resist Purugly's STAB moves and have good physical bulk, making them good answers to it. They can also use it as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin in Armaldo's case and can KO Purugly with their strong moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite Purugly's high Speed and access to priority, certain Choice Scarf Pokemon can outspeed and dispose of it. These include Simipour, Raichu, Rotom-F, and Mr. Mime. However, they must still be wary of Sucker Punch, especially when Purugly is boosted. Floatzel can also outspeed and KO Purugly if it has taken some minor damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status from Pokemon such as Misdreavus or Stunfisk cripples Purugly by either making it completely useless in the case of Thunder Wave (or a Static paralysis) and Will-O-Wisp or wearing it down incredibly quickly in the case of Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out is a powerful priority move that is guaranteed to flinch and makes up much of Purugly's niche. Return is a strong STAB move, and Sucker Punch provides another priority move to aid in revenge killing. With both Fake Out and Sucker Punch, Purugly is able to revenge kill a lot of frail Pokemon. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Misdreavus hard and removes foes' items, while U-turn is useful for momentum purposes, but Purugly's other moves are usually too important to give up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread is standard for physically offensive Pokemon. Life Orb gives much-needed power to Purugly's coverage moves, but Silk Scarf is a decent alternative that keeps Purugly from being worn down as easily while still powering up its Normal-type moves. Defiant lets Purugly terrorize Sticky Web teams and discourage the use of Defog.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Purugly into predicted Defogs in order to get a +2 Attack boost. Try not to switch into attacks, as Purugly is very frail and has no resistances. Come in to revenge kill frail Pokemon such as Kadabra when needed with the combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch or Return. Purugly functions well under the opponent's Sticky Web because of the +2 boost it gets from Defiant and its strong priority moves. If you need Purugly to revenge kill a specific Pokemon later in the game, it is best to not keep it in on a Pokemon that it cannot KO, as it will usually be unable to take a hit in return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Purugly works best on heavy offense teams because it provides little to no defensive synergy. Spikes-stacking teams benefit from having Purugly as a teammate because of its ability to discourage and take advantage of Defog; good users of Spikes include Crustle and Roselia. A spinblocker such as Misdreavus or Dusknoir is also a good choice on these teams. Likewise, Purugly fits quite nicely onto Sticky Web and dual screens hyper offense teams.</p>"

  "Bronzor": {
    "overview": "<p>While definitely not a top-tier defensive threat, Bronzor has managed to carve out a defensive niche, boasting the ability to check powerful offensive Pokemon such as Golem and Arbok, thanks to its great defensive typing in combination with its Levitate ability. Bronzor works best on defensive or balanced teams, where it can utilize its incredible nine resistances and two immunities to reliably set Stealth Rock facing a variety of common threats in the PU metagame such as Chatot, Articuno, and Golem. Unfortunately not all is good for Bronzor, as very low offensive stats combined with very low Speed make it very passive, meaning it can be taken advantage of by a variety of boosting sweepers as well as most offensive Pokemon. Bronzor's impressive list of resistances and immunities is somewhat offset by its weakness to common typings in Dark and Fire. Lastly, Bronzor's only form of reliable recovery is Rest, which renders it useless for two turns, and thus using Bronzor often requires the use of a cleric to support it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If Bronzor is only being relied on to take on physical threats such as Stoutland and Golem, maximum Defense investment can be used instead of a mixed defensive spread. Sleep Talk or Psych Up can be user over Stealth Rock if another member on Bronzor's team is already a capable Stealth Rock setter. Psych Up allows Bronzor to steal the boosts from Pokemon such as Calm Mind Duosion and Bulk Up Ursaring, preventing them from boosting up and breaking through Bronzor. Sleep Talk gives Bronzor a chance to throw out Toxic or Psywave while still asleep, making it slightly less passive and reducing the need for Bronzor to be paired with a cleric.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Pawniard, Cacturne, and Krokorok not only are immune to Bronzor's only attacking move, Psywave, but they also threaten Bronzor with their Dark STAB moves. Pawniard is a particularly good counter because it is immune to both Psywave and Toxic and can Pursuit trap Bronzor reliably.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rapidash, Monferno, and Combusken are just a few of a slew of Fire-types that are able to threaten Bronzor with their powerful, super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users</strong>: Taunt prevents Bronzor from using important utility moves like Rest and Toxic. Offensive Taunt users such as Floatzel and Grumpig are the best examples of Pokemon that utilize this strategy, as they can weaken Bronzor and then Taunt it to prevent recovery.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Sweepers</strong>: With Bronzor relying on Toxic and Psywave as its only way to deal damage, Pokemon that can boost quickly such as Shell Smash Gorebyss, Nasty Plot Chatot, and Swords Dance Leafeon will often be able to overwhelm Bronzor, as it is far too passive to threaten them.</p> <p><strong>Losing Eviolite</strong>: Bronzor relies heavily on its Eviolite to remain effective, as without it its bulk is significant decreased, simply failing to check common Pokemon such as Stoutland and Golem, which it would usually be relied upon to deal with. Trick users such as Mr. Mime and Rotom-F can be used to rid Bronzor of its Eviolite, while defensive Knock Off users such as Clefairy and Mawile are often able to lure Bronzor in and remove its item.</p>",

Psywave is used to deal direct damage, between 50 HP and 150 HP, making it tougher for Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Grumpig to take advantage of Bronzor and use it as setup fodder. Toxic is used to catch Pokemon that may try to switch in and take advantage of Bronzor's passivity while also generally wearing down defensive Pokemon. Rest gives Bronzor a somewhat reliable means of recovery, although it makes it vulnerable for the two turns that it is asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP with heavy Defense investment enables Bronzor to act as a reliable physical wall, dealing with Pokemon such as Muk, Stoutland, and Bouffalant. 112 Special Defense investment buffers Bronzor when facing special attackers such as Mr. Mime and lets it avoid the 3HKO from Grumpig's Shadow Ball and +6 Clefairy's Moonblast. Levitate is Bronzor's ability of choice, granting it a value Ground immunity and setting it apart from Metang.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzor is used mainly to check physical threats such as Golem, Mawile, and Muk. Bring Bronzor in against these Pokemon, and proceed to set up Stealth Rock or spread status via Toxic. While getting up Stealth Rock will often be the first priority, if a powerful wallbreaker or boosting threat such as Cacturne or Gorebyss is threatening to switch in on Bronzor, don't be afraid to try to Toxic it as it switches in to wear it down; Bronzor can always set Stealth Rock at a later stage in the battle. Another thing to keep in mind is that Bronzor's low Speed stat means that it will almost always be moving second; this is relevant because if Bronzor wants to recover with Rest, it must do so earlier rather than later to avoid being outsped and KOed on the turn it tries to recover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With Bronzor being incapacitated for two turns once it clicks Rest, a reliable cleric such as Audino, Altaria, or Clefairy is often a good start when looking for teammates. It is usually easy to fit one or even two of these Pokemon alongside Bronzor due to the fact that they share great defensive synergy. Altaria deals with Knock Off users such as Leafeon and Pawniard, while Audino and Clefairy handle powerful special attackers such as Floatzel and Cacturne. Muk is another Pokemon that pairs well with Bronzor, as Bronzor can soak up attacks from Ground-types such as Golem and Gabite, while Muk can easily handle special attackers such as Rotom-F, Combusken, and Cacturne. Pelipper is another good partner, able to act as somewhat of a reliable Knock Off sponge, while also dealing with threatening Fire-types such as Monferno and Combusken.</p>"

  "Chatot": {
    "overview": "<p>Chatot is one of the best anti-offense Pokemon in the PU metagame due to its access to a 140-Base Power STAB move in Boomburst. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Chatot is capable of outspeeding and OHKOing many prominent offensive threats in the metagame, including Floatzel and Zebstrika, while possessing only a few checks on offense. It can also run a solid Choice Specs set, which can dismantle slower teams if given the right support. Furthermore, solid coverage options such as Heat Wave and Hidden Power Fighting allow it to take on Steel-types more easily, and it also has access to U-turn for momentum. However, Chatot is rather frail, and the Choice Specs set can struggle against offensive teams due to Chatot's low base Speed, while the Choice Scarf set is easily walled by Pokemon such as Audino. In addition, Chatot's weakness to Stealth Rock can limit the number of times it can switch in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot is another option usually used with Life Orb or Silk Scarf that can help Chatot take on bulkier Pokemon such as Audino and perform more as a setup sweeper; the problem with this is that it is easily revenge killed because of its frailty and bad Speed tier compared to other offensive Pokemon. Substitute along with Salac Berry and Encore can be used with Nasty Plot to avoid status moves or lock the foe into a move that can deal little to no damage to Chatot. Chatot can also make use of Agility or Tailwind along with Life Orb or Silk Scarf, allowing it to outspeed offensive threats such as Zebstrika and Simipour; Agility can only support Chatot, while Tailwind supports the entirety of Chatot's team. Taunt allows Chatot to prevent the foe from using status moves, such as Grumpig's Thunder Wave, or to prevent Pokemon such as Roselia from setting up entry hazards. Chatot can make use of Air Cutter for a STAB boost, but it is very weak overall and Boomburst is a much more spammable STAB move. Chatot can also use Ominous Wind to take on Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, although it is very weak and situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir are immune to Chatot's Boomburst and don't take super effective damage from any of its attacks; Misdreavus can take advantage of Chatot by setting up on it with Nasty Plot, and Dusknoir can predict Chatot's switch and use Trick, crippling a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Soundproof</strong>: Mr. Mime and Electrode both have an immunity to Boomburst when using the ability Soundproof and the ability to OHKO Chatot after Stealth Rock, making them easy counters.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Zebstrika and Simipour, although being unable to switch in, are able to outspeed and KO Chatot, especially if Chatot doesn't have a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Audino and Grumpig can take hits from Choice Scarf Chatot relatively well, although they struggle to take on Choice Specs Chatot; the former can wear it down by using Knock Off and constantly healing itself with Wish while the latter can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Golem and Probopass resist Chatot's Boomburst and can retaliate with super effective attacks; the former can take advantage of Chatot by setting up Stealth Rock against it, while the latter can gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Because Chatot is so frail, it is vulnerable to priority moves such as Mightyena's Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika, Raichu, and Electabuzz all outspeed Chatot and are able to OHKO it with either Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. If Chatot is switched out, the foe can use Volt Switch and gain momentum.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst allows Chatot to take on a lot of offensive Pokemon, especially with Chatot's Choice Scarf to help it outspeed them. Heat Wave is used to take on Steel-types such as Klang. It is also the best move that Chatot has to take on Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL. Hidden Power Fighting is also helpful for taking on Steel- and Rock-types such as Probopass and Golem. U-turn is helpful for gaining momentum against Pokemon Chatot can't hit as hard, such as Misdreavus and Grumpig.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs along with a Timid nature and Choice Scarf are used to be as fast as possible so Chatot can outspeed Pokemon such as Gorebyss after a Shell Smash and Choice Scarf Rotom-F while still hitting very hard. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into Special Defense to allow Chatot to switch into Stealth Rock four times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chatot can be switched in after a KO to revenge kill the foe or be pivoted in by a slow Volt Switch or U-turn to give it a safe switch without taking damage. It shouldn't be switched into attacks, even if it resists the foe's move, as it is very frail and can be easily worn down. It should mainly spam Boomburst, as it can take on a ton of Pokemon in the tier, being able to OHKO Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Leafeon. Chatot can also be used as a late-game cleaner once the opponent's team has been weakened. If a Pokemon that Chatot can't take on well is on the opposing team, such as Misdreavus or Dusknoir, Chatot should use U-turn to gain momentum and switch to a more suitable Pokemon to take on the foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users make for good partners for Chatot, as they can provide it with a free switch. Probopass is a great partner for Chatot, as it provides a slow Volt Switch, giving Chatot a free switch, and it can trap Steel-types such as Metang and opposing Probopass with Magnet Pull to allow Chatot to freely spam Boomburst. Pursuit trappers such as Stoutland are helpful to Chatot to take out Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, therefore allowing Chatot to freely spam Boomburst. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Torkoal and Pelipper respectfully are good partners for Chatot to clear away Stealth Rock, which it is weak to. Pokemon such as Ursaring and Ninetales are good partners for Chatot to take on bulkier Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Audino, therefore allowing Chatot to sweep. Entry hazard setters such as Roselia and Dwebble are helpful to Chatot to allow it to 2HKO Pokemon it normally wouldn't.</p>"

It is also the best option that Chatot has to take on Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL. Hidden Power Fighting is also helpful for taking on Steel- and Rock-types such as Probopass and Golem. U-turn is helpful for gaining momentum against Pokemon it can't hit as hard such as Misdreavus and Dusclops; however, Chatot is limited in how many times it can use U-turn if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs along with a Modest nature and Choice Specs are used to hit extremely hard and to outspeed Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Mr. Mime. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into Special Defense which allows Chatot to switch into Stealth Rock four times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chatot can be switched in after a KO or pivoted in by a slow Volt Switch or U-turn to give it a safe switch in without taking damage. It shouldn't be switched into attacks, even on resisted moves, because it is very frail and easily worn down. It should mainly spam Boomburst, as there are few neutral targets that can take two of them. Chatot should be used to wallbreak, allowing its teammates to sweep. If a Pokemon that Chatot can't take on well such as Misdreavus and Dusclops is on the opposing team, Chatot should use U-turn to gain momentum, although it shouldn't use U-turn too often if Stealth Rock is up on your side of the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Probopass is a great partner for Chatot, as it can trap Steel-types such as Klang and opposing Probopass with Magnet Pull to allow Chatot to freely spam Boomburst. It also provides a slow Volt Switch, giving Chatot a free switch. Pursuit trappers such as Stoutland make for good partners because of their ability to take out Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, therefore allowing Chatot to freely spam Boomburst. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Armaldo and Swanna are good partners because of their ability to clear away Stealth Rock, which Chatot is weak to; Rapid Spin is preferred over Defog though, because Chatot appreciates entry hazards of its own. Leavanny is a good partner for Chatot, as it can lay down Sticky Web, causing the foe's team to be slowed down, allowing Chatot to outspeed faster threats such as Ninetales and Raichu. Alternatively, Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Kadabra is helpful to allow Chatot to outspeed bulkier threats, even affecting Flying-type and Levitate foes, unlike Sticky Web. Entry hazard setters such as Roselia and Dwebble are helpful to Chatot to wear down bulkier Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Grumpig; Stealth Rock allows Chatot to 2HKO both of them after they take damage. Setup sweepers such as Misdreavus and Ninetales appreciate Chatot's wallbreaking capabilities because it helps them sweep more easily.</p>"

  "Gabite": {
    "overview": "<p>Gabite's unique Speed tier and access to Stealth Rock grant it a niche as the tier's fastest Stealth Rock setter. Its ability to set entry hazards while outspeeding slower Taunt users, as well as its decent Attack stat and access to strong STAB-boosted moves in Dragon Claw and Earthquake, lends to Gabite's ability to threaten opposing teams by quickly applying offensive pressure. Additionally, Gabite's excellent defensive typing along with its Eviolite-boosted bulk allows it to tank several hits from Fire-, Rock-, and Poison-types such as Rapidash and Muk. Its ability Rough Skin discourages the use of contact moves against it, and together with the damage it deals via Toxic and Stealth Rock, Gabite excels at providing the residual damage needed for offensive teams to clean up late-game. However, Gabite's low Special Defense allows it to be pressured by specially offensive Pokemon, especially those that outspeed it and are able to exploit its 4x weakness to Ice such as Floatzel and Rotom-F. Gabite also struggles to bring down physically defensive walls with access to recovery such as Vullaby, Gourgeist-XL, and Pelipper. Gabite's own lack of recovery and vulnerabilities to status and entry hazards can sometimes limit its ability to check threats, like Monferno, reliably throughout a match. Despite these flaws, Gabite differentiates itself from other Stealth Rock setters through its uncommon combination of good physical bulk, decent Attack, and relatively high Speed, and it is therefore an advantageous choice for most offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gabite can use a Choice Scarf set with Outrage, Dragon Claw, Earthquake, and Stone Edge to outspeed and KO naturally faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Zebstrika. However, locking into one of these attacks can easily be exploited by your opponent, and Gabite is still fairly slow, which means its utility as a revenge killer is fairly limited. Fire Blast weakens defensive Grass-types that might switch into Gabite, such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL; however, they are already weakened by Toxic. Rest with Heal Bell support or Sleep Talk gives Gabite a source of recovery and removes status, which helps it stay around longer. A Choice Band or Life Orb set allows Gabite to do a bit more damage to defensive walls such as Vullaby and Rotom-S at the cost of bulk, but it is left more vulnerable to physical threats like Rapidash if it forgoes its Eviolite. Stone Edge is useful for helping Gabite take on Flying-types, mainly Defoggers like Vullaby and Pelipper; however, it is typically better to take care of them via residual damage from Stealth Rock and Toxic. Stone Edge can also be used against Ice-types that may switch into Gabite, such as Rotom-F and Cryogonal, as your opponent predicts Earthquake or Dragon Claw instead. Iron Tail can be used on a Choice Band set to 2HKO Fairy-types such as Clefairy. Finally, a specially defensive spread with a Careful nature allows Gabite to survive special attacks, most notably Zebstrika's Hidden Power Ice, which will allow partners weak to Zebstrika like Jumpluff to sweep more effectively late-game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Gourgeist-XL and Tangela can tank Gabite's attacks. Gourgeist-XL can use Will-O-Wisp to halve Gabite's Attack stat and put it on a timer, while Tangela can KO Gabite with Hidden Power Ice or Giga Drain and then recover any HP lost via Synthesis or Regenerator. Vullaby and Pelipper operate similarly and can whittle Gabite down; however, they must be wary of Toxic and Stealth Rock. Lastly, Bronzor is a perfect counter, given that it resists Dragon Claw, is immune to both Toxic and Earthquake, and is able to wear Gabite down via Psywave and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Clefairy and Mr. Mime are immune to Gabite's Dragon-type STAB move and deal super effective STAB damage in return. Clefairy is also immune to Toxic and can use Gabite as setup fodder. Although Mr. Mime cannot switch into Gabite's Earthquake, it can threaten it if given a free switch.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Articuno, Rotom-F, and Cryogonal do not like switching in on Gabite's Dragon Claw if Stealth Rock are up, but they can retaliate with x4 super effective STAB moves. Additionally, Cryogonal can remove Gabite's Stealth Rock via Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Faster special attackers, such as Floatzel and Simipour, can take advantage of Gabite's low Special Defense and deal damage without having to worry about taking damage from Rough Skin.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp and Toxic deal a lot of residual damage to Gabite, forcing it to eventually switch out, and are especially effective against it given its lack of reliable recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a must-have for many teams because it deals damage to opposing Pokemon as they switch in while also breaking Sturdy on Pokemon like Golem. Earthquake is Gabite's strongest STAB move and helps it beat most other Stealth Rock setters, like Mawile. Dragon Claw hits Grass- and Flying-types, which resist Ground, for neutral damage. Toxic deals extra residual damage to bulkier Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and puts bulky Defoggers such as Vullaby and Pelipper on a timer.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs help Gabite deal as much damage as possible with its STAB attacks. 252 Speed EVs allow Gabite to outspeed some Pokemon that may carry Taunt such as Grumpig and Monferno as well as slower wallbreakers like Stoutland while also letting it get up its own Stealth Rock faster. A Jolly nature allows Gabite to outspeed and OHKO Jolly Monferno, positive-natured Pokemon with base 80 Speed like Jolly Arbok and Timid Grumpig, +2 Speed Klang, and Smeargle. An Adamant nature maximizes Gabite's damage output and guarantees the 2HKO on defensive Altaria without requiring Stealth Rock damage. Rough Skin allows Gabite to get small amounts of chip damage off whenever a foe uses a contact move such as Close Combat, Return, or U-turn. Eviolite gives Gabite more bulk, helping it take more attacks, which in turn lets it deal more chip damage via Rough Skin.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gabite should switch in on physical attackers that it walls such as Monferno, Rapidash, and Curse Muk; after it has forced a switch, Gabite should use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, cripple the incoming check to Ground-types with Toxic, or attack with either Dragon Claw or Earthquake. Gabite beats most other Stealth Rock setters, with the exception of Bronzor and Prinplup, so the offensive pressure it offers often forces your opponent to choose between setting Stealth Rock or preserving their setter. This can be used to deter entry hazards from being set and is therefore helpful to teammates that may be weak to Stealth Rock. When Gabite is on low HP, it can be sacrificed by switching directly into a contact move in order to cause damage via Rough Skin. Using Gabite's Ground typing to switch into Electric-type moves is fairly risky, given that most Electric-types carry Ice-type coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gabite can be used on offensive teams that want a fast Stealth Rock setter with offensive presence. Pokemon with Defiant like Pawniard receive an Attack boost when their foes attempt to remove Gabite's Stealth Rock via Defog. Similarly, Contrary Servine can use a predicted Defog to gain an evasion boost, which may let it sweep more effectively. Wallbreakers like Choice Band Stoutland and Choice Band Leafeon appreciate the Stealth Rock support Gabite offers, and at the same time, Gabite can weaken their checks and counters, such as Altaria, Monferno, and Gourgeist XL, with either one of its STAB moves or Toxic. Pokemon such as Thick Fat Grumpig and Probopass can be used as switch-ins to Ice-type Pokemon that threaten Gabite. Other entry hazard stackers, specifically Spikes setters like Quilladin, can be used to further whittle down switch-ins alongside Gabite's Stealth Rock, Rough Skin, and Toxic, and can serve as a switch-in to offensive Water-types. In return, Quilladin's weaknesses to Fire-, Bug-, and Poison-type attacks can be accounted for by Gabite. Gabite works well with Pokemon that are weak to Fire coverage, such as Leafeon and Rotom-F. Water-types, such as Lumineon and Politoed, pair nicely with Gabite, as it is forced out by offensive Water-types such as Floatzel and Basculin.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides support for Gabite's teammates by damaging switch-ins and deactivating Sturdy and Focus Sashes. Earthquake is Gabite's STAB move of choice and allows it to check Pokemon like Pawniard, Arbok, and Monferno. Dragon Claw deals neutral damage to Flying and Grass-types, which resist Ground-type moves, as well as super effective damage to opposing Dragon-types like Vibrava, Altaria, and Fraxure. Toxic wears down opposing Pokemon, dealing increased residual damage every turn. Roar forces a foe out, and it can be important in match-ups against Pokemon like Curse Muk and Coil Arbok. Additionally, it can be used to rack up entry hazard damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment along with an Impish nature is run to help Gabite take on physically offensive threats, such as Rapidash and Monferno, and wear them down with Rough Skin and Toxic. 80 Speed EVs allow Gabite to outspeed Pawniard and KO it with Earthquake. The rest of Gabite's EVs are put into its HP stat to help it sponge various attacks. Rough Skin punishes physical attackers that rely on contact moves, causing 12.5% damage each time they hit Gabite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gabite should switch into physically offensive threats that it walls in order to set up Stealth Rock early-game. Gabite should be preserved if it is needed to wall a specific Pokemon such as Arbok or Rapidash. After setting up Stealth Rock, Gabite should be used to spread Toxic and deal as much chip damage as possible with its STAB attacks and Rough Skin. Gabite's Roar should be used to rack up entry hazard damage if Spikes, Toxic Spikes, or Stealth Rock are in play. Toxic should be used on a predicted switch to Pokemon that are immune to or resist Gabite's Earthquake, like Vullaby, Leafeon, and Swanna. In general, using Gabite to switch into Electric-type moves is risky, as it needs to predict perfectly against Choice Scarf Rotom-F and can only switch into Zebstrika if it's using Hidden Power Grass or Water over Hidden Power Ice. Defensive Gabite is also vulnerable to faster Taunt users like Misdreavus and should switch out in order to avoid being burned by Will-O-Wisp, especially given its lack of recovery. A Rapid Spin user that is at 12.5% HP or below health can be KOed by Gabite before entry hazards are successfully removed thanks to Gabite's Rough Skin. Finally, once the threats Gabite needs to wall have been dispatched, its Rough Skin can find some last-second utility when Gabite is sacrificed and switched into physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Gabite can be used on balance teams as a bulky Stealth Rock setter. Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Grumpig, can be used with Gabite as a switch-in to specially offensive Pokemon in order to sponge Ice-type moves on Gabite's behalf. Other Pokemon that resist Ice, such as Metang and Ninetales, operate similarly, protecting Gabite from Regice, Cryogonal, and Articuno. Ninetales is also able to remove Grass-types that can switch into Gabite's Earthquake, while Metang can run Stealth Rock itself to free up a slot for Gabite to use Roar. Status absorbers such as Clefairy and Duosion partner nicely with Gabite to prevent it from being whittled down. Heal Bell and Wish support can be run as a form of recovery, making Audino an effective partner on more defensively oriented teams. In return, Gabite can address many of the physical attackers that check Audino, like Monferno and Pawniard. Roar Gabite can also be paired with other entry hazard setters, mainly Spikes setters like Quilladin, Roselia, and Crustle. Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Zebstrika can be used to pressure opposing Defog users so that Gabite's Stealth Rock will have a lower chance of being removed. Finally, wallbreakers like Stoutland and Dodrio benefit from Stealth Rock support and share nice synergy with Gabite; Dodrio is pressured by Stealth Rock setters like Golem and Stunfisk, which are both checked by Gabite's STAB-boosted Earthquake. Additionally, Gabite can be used to switch into attacks that would have hit Dodrio super effectively, namely Rock- and Electric-type moves. Similarly, Stoutland is checked by Monferno, which is also beaten by Earthquake.</p>"

  "Munchlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Munchlax distinguishes itself from other Pokemon in the PU tier with its extremely high HP stat and Eviolite-boosted defenses, which allow it to live almost any unboosted special attack such as Zebstrika's Thunderbolt or Simipour's Hydro Pump with ease. It has only one weakness, being Fighting-types, which are uncommon outside of Combusken and Monferno, as they are the only two relevant Fighting-types. Thick Fat allows Munchlax to take on Fire- and Ice-types such as Ninetales and Cryogonal with ease and gives it a niche over Lickilicky, although it is threatened by Taunt and Knock Off unlike Lickilicky. Munchlax's relatively high Attack stat allows it to hit hard, even without investment, and prevents it from being setup bait. On the downside, Munchlax has trouble taking down common Ghost-types due to its lack of coverage. It is also left vulnerable to strong physical attacks before boosting its Defense with Curse and lacks reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Munchlax can run a more defensively based set with Whirlwind over Curse, a spread of 252 HP / 136 Def / 120 SpD, and an Impish nature, which allows it to phaze boosting Pokemon, but Munchlax then loses out on the ability to set up itself. Munchlax can use Seed Bomb to take on Rock-types such as Golem so that it isn't dead weight against it. Zen Headbutt is an option over Body Slam that prevents Munchlax from being completely walled by Ghost-types, although this causes Munchlax to be walled by Dark-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Munchlax can't touch Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, so they can set up on it or easily wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Munchlax struggles to take hits from Fighting-types, particularly Close Combat from Monferno and Focus Blast from Combusken.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Munchlax needs its Eviolite to take as many hits as possible and set up, and Knock Off gets rid of it. Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Leafeon threaten Munchlax a lot because they can remove its Eviolite and wear it down with their other attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Choice Band variants of Golem can proceed to 2HKO Munchlax with Earthquake and can even 2HKO it after Munchlax has a Curse up after Stealth Rock. Probopass can Taunt Munchlax and prevent it from setting up Curse and healing itself with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Pawniard and Klang can take hits from Munchlax and set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Grumpig can Taunt Munchlax so that it is unable to set up or recover with Rest, therefore limiting what it can do and making it easier to take out. The former can Will-O-Wisp Munchlax and prevent it from recovering, while the latter can deal a lot of damage to it with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick not only lowers Munchlax's bulk by taking its Eviolite but also gives it an item it doesn't need, which is usually a Choice item. Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Dusknoir can Trick Munchlax a Choice item, locking it into a move that can't do any damage, or an attacking move that another Pokemon can take advantage of.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon that can phaze Munchlax such as Avalugg are able to deal with it by taking away its boosts and forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers such as Rampardos and Ursaring can take on Munchlax before it has set up and KO it with little to no consequence, therefore forcing Munchlax out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "CurseLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse boosts Munchlax's Attack and Defense stats, allowing it to survive more hits such as Mightyena's Crunch. It also allows Munchlax to deal more damage and break through Pokemon that would usually counter it, such as Probopass. Body Slam can deal a lot of damage, even unboosted, and has the chance to paralyze threats that try to set up on it. Rest allows Munchlax to fully restore its health and get rid of another status ailment. Once Munchlax is asleep, it is able to switch into sleep inducers such as Jumpluff. Sleep Talk allows Munchlax to attack or set up while it is asleep so that it isn't complete setup fodder. Earthquake is an option over Sleep Talk, as it allows Munchlax to hit Steel- and Rock-types such as Probopass and Pawniard for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread and a Careful nature aim to maximize the number of special attacks that Munchlax can take, as Curse boosts its physical defense. Thick Fat allows Munchlax to easily take hits from Fire- and Ice-types such as Ninetales and Rotom-F. Eviolite boosts Munchlax's Defense and Special Defense stats by 50 percent, allowing it to take a ton of special hits and take more physical hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Munchlax can be used early-game to pivot into some special attackers such as Zebstrika and Simipour and Fire- and Ice-types such as Rapidash and Vanilluxe. Use Curse in the late-game against a Pokemon that is unable to set up against Munchlax, such as Rapidash or Zebstrika. Munchlax can switch in on most special attacks, but it can't take on moves such as Focus Blast from strong special attackers like Raichu and +2 Simisear. Be wary of Knock Off, as it will destroy Munchlax's walling capabilities. Munchlax can take weaker physical attacks, but, even with Eviolite, it doesn't have the physical bulk for repetitive switches into strong physical attacks. Unless your opponent has a Ghost-type, Body Slam should be the move Munchlax is spamming, as it allows you to spread paralysis to the opponent's team. Only use Rest when Munchlax's HP is low or if Munchlax can't survive a hit plus some residual damage such as poison. Sleep Talk is for when Munchlax is asleep. Only use it twice in a row because Munchlax wakes up on the third turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Munchlax works well with Pursuit trappers, such as Pawniard and Stoutland, as it can't touch Ghost-types. Probopass is a great partner for Munchlax, as it traps the Steel-types that Munchlax struggles to beat, such as Pawniard and Probopass. Fighting-types such as Combusken and Monferno also help to deal with Steel-types, notably Pawniard. Because Munchlax can be vulnerable to some physical attackers, it appreciates physical walls, especially ones that can take on Fighting-types, such as Pelipper. Munchlax needs its Eviolite to take as many hits as possible, so it appreciates Pokemon that can take Knock Off easily such as Mawile and Jumpluff. Munchlax is best used on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams due to its ability to take a lot of hits and its relatively decent offensive presence with Body Slam. Pokemon such as Pelipper, Jumpluff, and Arbok are helpful to Munchlax, as they can switch into Fighting-types, which Munchlax is weak to.</p>"

  "Hippopotas": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippopotas has access to a wide range of support moves, including reliable recovery in Slack Off, and works as a great sand setter and support Pokemon for sand teams due to its ability Sand Stream. However, Hippopotas has mediocre special bulk and only passable physical bulk without an Eviolite, which can make it difficult to set up sand multiple times throughout a match. Moreover, it is very predictable in which set it is running due to its lack of versatility, so the opponent is most likely going to know what attacks are coming and be able to play around that. It doesn't enjoy taking a Knock Off, as it relies on Smooth Rock for the extra sand turns.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippopotas can opt to run an Eviolite to be more useful outside of setting sand at the cost of leaving Stoutland less time to sweep. It can also run a normal defensive Eviolite set off of sand teams, which finds a small niche over other defensive Ground-types such as Golem or Gabite thanks to its access to reliable recovery. In both cases, running a spread of 248 HP / 36 Def / 224 SpD and an Impish nature allows Hippopotas to hard counter Zebstrika and Electrode while still keeping physical bulk to handle attackers such as Golem and Monferno. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD is an option for Smooth Rock Hippopotas due to it already having a decent Defense stat. This spread allows Hippopotas to survive a special hit or two before fainting rather than just getting OHKOed like it normally would. Yawn is another option for preventing opposing Pokemon from setting up and forcing the opponent to switch, allowing you to gain momentum by double switching.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Politoed and Swanna don't like to take a Toxic, but they can easily come in on an Earthquake and hit back with Scald, doing a decent amount of damage and potentially crippling Hippopotas with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Roselia and Tangela can take an Earthquake with ease, while Roselia can switch in on Toxic too due to its Poison typing. They can also KO Hippopotas with a super effective Giga Drain, which means they will also gain back any damage that was taken upon switching in. Since Hippopotas can't even touch it, Roselia can set up hazards too.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Due to Hippopotas's mono-Ground coverage, it is only able to damage Flying-types such as Dodrio and Driflblim with Toxic or phaze them with Whirlwind. Some, such as Swanna, can remove its entry hazards, and many carry super effective coverage for Hippopotas, including Articuno and Jumpluff.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Articuno are immune to Earthquake and can fire back with super effective STAB moves. Avalugg has access to Rapid Spin for removing Stealth Rock, while Regice can use Hippopotas as setup fodder if it does not carry Whirlwind. However, Ice-types have to be more cautious when switching in due to their weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Grumpig can cripple Hippopotas by stopping it from setting up Stealth Rock or using Toxic with Taunt and then proceeding to fire off their own attacks, eventually making it faint.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Pokemon with access to Knock Off, such as Pawniard, Simisear, and Purugly can Knock Off Hippopotas's Smooth Rock, reducing the number of sand turns that Hippopotas's teammates have to sweep before Hippopotas needs to be brought in again.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes, limit the number of times that Hippopotas can switch in to set up sand and come back in later on. They also reduce the number of times Hippopotas's teammates can switch in.</p> <p><strong>Other Weather Teams</strong>: Other weather teams can stop Hippopotas from supporting its own team with sand. When facing Hippopotas, try to preserve your own weather setter until Hippopotas has fainted.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a standard entry hazard, which, when combined with the sand, can slowly wear down opposing Pokemon when they switch in. Slack Off provides reliable recovery in order to ensure that Hippopotas is kept at a reasonable amount of health so that it can come in to set up sand later on in the battle. Earthquake is the only attack that Hippopotas needs as it can wear down Pokemon such as Grumpig, Politoed, and Gabite. Whirlwind is used to prevent Pokemon from setting up on Hippopotas. Toxic is an option over Whirlwind if you don't find Pokemon trying to set up too much of an issue and would rather wear down bulky opponents such as Tangela and Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Smooth Rock is the ideal item for Hippopotas because although it is built for taking hits, its main objective is to get up sand in order to support sweepers such as Stoutland, and the extra turns of sand can allow Stoutland to stay in longer rather than be forced to switch. An Impish nature and EVs in HP and Defense ensure that Hippopotas has got as much physical bulk as possible. Sand Stream's sand is used to support the team and to wear down opposing Pokemon to the point where sweepers such as Stoutland can perform a late-game sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippopotas isn't very useful on its own. It supports its team by getting up sand and then switching out in order to bring the sand back later on in the battle. Sacrificing Hippopotas near the end of a battle is fine if you're certain that last amount of sand is enough for a Pokemon to clean up. Hippopotas should only use support moves when necessary, such as when predicting a switch; switch out otherwise. Use Stealth Rock to cripple foes as they switch in; however, you should also try to outplay the opponent and double switch so as to not waste sand turns. Hippopotas can take special hits but only to a certain extent; play around the opposing team and be smart when bringing it in on certain Pokemon. Hippopotas should be switched out as soon as possible, as this allows you to get the maximum number of sand turns for your teammates. Earthquake should only be used to finish off weakened opponents and to hit frail Pokemon as they switch in.</p> <p>Whirlwind is used for threatening opponents that plan on setting up, and Slack Off is for when Hippopotas is low on HP and you need it to set up sand later in the battle. Keeping Hippopotas healthy is essential so that it can be brought in later on to take a hit and get sand up again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Having Stoutland as a teammate is pretty much mandatory, as without it there's little reason to set up sand. Additionally, offensive partners for Stoutland, such as Monferno and Floatzel, will generally be found on the same team as Hippopotas. Grass-type Pokemon such as Roselia resist Water- and Grass-type moves. Roselia can also hit Grass-types with Sludge Bomb and set up entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus can prevent your team's hazards from getting removed by Rapid Spin users.</p> <p>Water-type Pokemon such as Politoed can take Water- and Ice-type attacks and force foes to either switch out or take a hard hit. Audino is a great specially defensive partner, although it's difficult to fit on sand teams, which are normally more offensive. Audino also has access to Heal Bell and Wish, which can be used for supporting the whole team rather than just Hippopotas.</p>"

  "Carnivine": {
    "overview": "<p>Carnivine is severely outclassed by other Grass-types such as Leafeon, Tangela, and Roselia due to its slow base Speed, mediocre defenses, and shallow support movepool. It lacks reliable recovery, can easily be worn down, and is easily revenge killed due to its poor Speed. Although it has Levitate, which gives it an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes; Sleep Powder, which usually gives it a chance to set up; and a good Attack stat coupled with a 120 Base Power STAB move and Knock Off, Carnivine still remains hopelessly outdone by its fellow Grass-types and will rarely, if ever, perform better than them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance can be run to boost on sleeping or weak Pokemon, but Carnivine is too slow to sweep teams, loses out on running Natural Gift, and is outclassed by Leafeon in this role. Substitute is also an option to give Carnivine protection against status and weak attacks. Leech Seed can be run over Sleep Powder for a SubSeed set, but it fails to get past any of Carnivine's normal counters and Carnivine is too slow to run it effectively, unlike better users such as Gourgeist-S. Leftovers can be used for some passive recovery to counteract losing health if running Substitute, but Carnivine is typically KOed too fast for the item to be useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types are immune to Sleep Powder and resist Power Whip, making them some of the best switch-ins to Carnivine, although some do not appreciate losing their Eviolite via Knock Off or being hit by Natural Gift. Most Grass-types carry super effective coverage versus other Grass-types, such as Tangela's Hidden Power Fire, and are capable of at least 3HKOing Carnivine. Jumpluff in particular takes very little damage from Knock Off, as it does not run an item, and can KO Carnivine with STAB Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although Fire-types are not immune to Sleep Powder and can be crippled on the switch in, they can switch into a resisted Power Whip fairly easily, and they are capable of OHKOing Carnivine, although most take heavy damage from Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types lack the resistances to Carnivine's attacks and sleep immunity of Grass-types, but they can all KO Carnivine with their super effective STAB moves. Ice-types such as Rotom-F should be careful, however, since they take heavy damage from Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon can easily OHKO or 2HKO Carnivine with their super effective STAB moves. Most Flying-types resist Power Whip aside from Swanna, although Knock Off does a significant amount to most if Carnivine can catch them on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: All strong attackers in the metagame are capable of 2HKOing Carnivine thanks to its poor defenses. Carnivine is also slower than most of them, leaving it prone to being revenge killed by practically every offensive Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sleep Powder allows Carnivine to cripple opposing Pokemon to get the chance to fire off its attacks. Power Whip is Carnivine's main STAB move, while Knock Off is used to hit Pokemon immune or resistant to Grass-type attacks and can cripple switch-ins such as Tangela and Vullaby, which are immune to Sleep Powder. Natural Gift gives Carnivine a one-time 100-Base Power Fire-type move to hit Grass-types with if it's running a Watmel Berry, and it can help improve Carnivine's poor coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature gives Carnivine as much wallbreaking power as possible. 68 Speed EVs allow Carnivine to outspeed uninvested Gourgeist-XL to hit it with a Knock Off. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to give Carnivine extra bulk. Watmel Berry is essential with Natural Gift, as otherwise Carnivine is incapable of using the move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Carnivine is most effectively used early- and mid-game where it can cripple opposing teams to support a sweep. Sleep Powder is the move Carnivine should use most of the time since it can start firing off attacks afterward. If you're predicting the opponent to send in a Pokemon immune to Sleep Powder such as Tangela or Zebstrika, use Knock Off or Natural Gift to get off damage, depending on the circumstance. Use Knock Off more early-game to cripple foes by removing their items. Be wary of switching Carnivine into Scald or status users such as Politoed or Misdreavus, as it is permanently crippled by burns and does not appreciate being worn down by Toxic or slowed by paralysis.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Kingler appreciate Carnivine's ability to Knock Off Eviolites from the likes of Tangela. They can also use the foe Carnivine has put to sleep as setup fodder provided that the foe does not switch out. Pokemon immune to Fire-type attacks, such as Rapidash, can help take on and discourage the use of Fire-type moves for Carnivine. Most Pokemon immune to Fire also carry super effective coverage for the Grass-types that can wall or threaten Carnivine. Pokemon that can take on Ice-types, such as Audino and Grumpig, can also help switch into Pokemon such as Articuno that threaten to revenge Carnivine. Zebstrika can counter Jumpluff, one of the biggest threats to Carnivine, as well as threaten other Flying- and Grass-types such as Swanna and Tangela. Pokemon with a slow pivoting move, such as Probopass, can get Carnivine a free switch onto the field with Volt Switch so that it avoids taking extra damage.</p>"

  "Lumineon": {
    "overview": "<p>Lumineon provides excellent role compression, being a great Water switch-in that can remove entry hazards and slow pivot all at once. It is just bulky enough to check many attackers, such as Golem, which lack a super effective move to hit Lumineon with. However, Lumineon can easily be broken through by strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Golem and Stoutland, and it is easily worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery. It is also weak to many of the most prominent threats in the metagame, such as Rotom-F, Leafeon, and Zebstrika, and faces competition from Politoed and Lapras as a Water-immune Pokemon and Prinplup, Vibrava, and Vullaby as a defensive Defog user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tailwind or Protect can be run over Toxic to provide either a Speed boost for teammates or extra Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam allows Lumineon to hit Grass-type switch-ins, but Lumineon is so weak that this is a poor option. Hidden Power Grass does more to the Water-types that Lumineon commonly switches into, but slow pivoting and wearing them down with Toxic is generally sufficient.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Due to Lumineon's mediocre bulk, it can be broken through by powerful wallbreakers, such as Stoutland and Leafeon, and can do little to deter their switching in besides U-turning out thanks to its poor offenses.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: All Grass-types take little from Lumineon's attacks and can do severe damage with their super effective STAB attacks in return. In particular, Roselia is immune to Toxic and can use Lumineon as setup fodder, and Jumpluff can Encore Lumineon into Defog before using it as setup fodder. However, some Grass-types, such as Quilladin and Gogoat, do not appreciate being crippled by Toxic or Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: All Electric-types can easily switch into Lumineon's attacks and use it for a free Volt Switch, either KOing Lumineon or gaining momentum for its teammates. Rotom-F can also set up a free Substitute on Lumineon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Since Lumineon lacks reliable recovery, it can be worn down by burn, Toxic, damage from entry hazards, and multiple weaker attacks until it is eventually KOed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog helps to remove entry hazards for Lumineon's teammates, and Scald threatens foes with burn but is incredibly weak. U-turn allows Lumineon to pivot out of foes that it counters, such as Simipour, to give teammates free switches in. Toxic helps cripple opposing Water-types such as Floatzel and bulky foes such as Vullaby and Audino.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature helps Lumineon take on physical attackers lacking a super effective move, such as Monferno, slightly better, and 8 Speed EVs lets Lumineon outspeed Pawniard. A Bold nature is used despite having a physical attack since U-turn is still incredibly weak without an Attack-reducing nature, and Lumineon does not want to decrease its other stats. Leftovers provides slight recovery to help negate some chip damage, and Storm Drain allows Lumineon to pivot into Water-type attackers more effectively by giving it an immunity to their STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lumineon can be brought in on opposing Water-types such as Floatzel and weaker walls such as Vullaby and Audino. Use free turns to remove entry hazards before attempting anything else. U-turn is a risk-free move versus faster foes that Lumineon walls, as it's guaranteed to safely bring in a teammate, so use it frequently. Keep Lumineon healthy, as allowing it to be weakened early-game can leave it open to being KOed on the switch in by attacks such as Floatzel's Focus Blast and Simipour's Grass Knot. Lumineon can be used as death fodder to bring a teammate in for free if it is no longer needed to wall Water-types and has already removed entry hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lumineon best supports teammates that need a reliable Water-type switch-in, such as Rapidash and Camerupt. It also helps Pokemon that need entry hazard removal to be effective, such as Regice and Simisear. Specially defensive teammates, such as Audino and Grumpig, can help take on special attackers that threaten Lumineon, and Electric-immune Pokemon such as Stunfisk help combat one of Lumineon's two weaknesses and prevent it from being Volt Switch fodder. Audino is also notable for being able to pass Wishes to Lumineon to help make up for its lack of recovery. Lumineon can be severely pressured by strong wallbreakers, such as Stoutland and Leafeon, so checks to them, such as Metang and Monferno, are highly appreciated. As Lumineon will be pivoting with U-turn versus Water-types frequently, teammates to revenge kill them such as Choice Scarf Rotom-F and Electrode are useful.</p>"

However, Lickilicky holds its notch above Bouffalant thanks to its access to Knock Off, allowing it to hit Ghost-types that would otherwise wall it. Lickilicky also has great bulk, meaning it can take hits rather well to effectively set up Swords Dance and boost its Attack to frightening levels. On the other hand, Lickilicky's typing gives it no notable resistances, meaning it can be worn down very easily by repeated attacks, and this problem is exacerbated by its lack of direct and reliable recovery. Lickilicky is also very prone to being revenge killed, as it is very slow and thus outsped by many other Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lickilicky can run a specially defensive set with Wish, but this is outclassed by Audino, which simply performs the role of a defensive Pokemon much better thanks to its ability Regenerator. Choice Band can be used to allow Lickilicky to hit harder, but Lickilicky loses the freedom it has with the other items and is left more vulnerable to revenge killing when locked into a move. Furthermore, Stoutland can run the item better thanks to its higher Speed. Power Whip can be used to hit Golem and Relicanth super effectively, but Earthquake already hits these Pokemon as well as Probopass and Pawniard. Hammer Arm can be used to hit Probopass and Pawniard super effectively, but the Speed drop is rather undesirable, as Lickilicky is already very slow and needs to maintain its Speed so that it can outspeed Vullaby. A set consisting of Curse / Sleep Talk / Rest / Return can be used to counter stall better and utilize Lickilicky's bulk well, as well as making Lickilicky a threatening attacker. While Munchlax is blessed with Eviolite and Thick Fat to help it run this set better, Lickilicky would not have to rely on its item for its physical bulk and can run other items unlike Munchlax, which is crippled once its Eviolite has been removed. Explosion can be used as a last resort when Lickilicky has done its job. Substitute can take the place of Lum Berry in order to allow Lickilicky to easily set up Swords Dance and dodge status. However, forgoing a coverage move causes Lickilicky to be walled by either Steel-, Rock-, or Ghost-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Monferno, Stoutland, Dodrio, and Ursaring are able to severely weaken or revenge kill Lickilicky due to their better Speed and high Attack stats.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Lickilicky is vulnerable to status inflictions once Lum Berry has been used up, meaning Will-O-Wisp users like Gourgeist-XL can prove difficult to deal with. Additionally, Lickilicky can be worn down over time by entry hazards, which can make it harder for it to set up with Swords Dance and at the same time make it easier to be revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to their high Defense, Pokemon such as Vullaby and Gourgeist-XL take very little damage from Lickilicky's moves and deal heavy damage with Foul Play.</p>",

Return is Lickilicky's only STAB move and does a great amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, especially after a boost. Knock Off notably hits Gourgeist-XL, a nuisance for most Normal-types to deal with, and it also provides utility in removing items; for example, it can remove the Eviolite from Misdreavus, allowing Lickilicky or a partner to easily take it out. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard, which resist Return and can usually shrug off any damage from an unboosted Knock Off. Body Slam can be used instead of Return if you favor the chance to paralyze the foe over a higher damage output.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Lum Berry is used so that Lickilicky is not crippled by status moves such as Gourgeist-XL's and Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to take them on much better. Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Lickilicky to hit as hard as possible, while 84 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed uninvested base 60s, namely Vullaby. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense and HP to improve Lickilicky's already good bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lickilicky should be used early-game so that it can deal as much damage as possible before it faints, allowing its teammates to clean late-game. In order to retain as much health as possible, bring Lickilicky in after a teammate has fainted or through a slow momentum-gaining move. This way, it is able to stay healthy and set up Swords Dance a bit more easily. Lickilicky should be using Return and Knock Off most of the time, as the former has good neutral coverage and the latter cripples Eviolite users such as Vullaby and Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lickilicky appreciates having a teammate that can deal with Fighting-types. Pokemon that provide this support include Mr. Mime, Altaria, and Clefairy. Revenge killers such as Ninjask and Chatot, as well as Pokemon such as Floatzel, Pawniard, and Ursaring, appreciate Lickilicky's ability to wallbreak, as it makes it easier for them to achieve KOs. Furthermore, Pokemon that can set their own hazards, such as Golem and Clefairy, are also useful partners, as they make gaining KOs easier for Lickilicky. Roselia and Quilladin also provide Spikes support. Slow Volt Switch or U-turn support from Pokemon such as Vullaby is appreciated, as Lickilicky does not like getting worn down quickly, and these Pokemon can safely get it in. Pokemon that are able to effectively spread paralysis, such as Grumpig and Stunfisk, can slow down the foe, making revenge killing Lickilicky much harder. Furthermore, Stunfisk and Grumpig can switch into Monferno for Lickilicky and KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p>"

Probopass works nicely both on offensive and defensive teams because it can run various sets thanks to access to both Sturdy and Magnet Pull, various utility moves, and decent coverage. Probopass's lack of firepower on defensive sets is compensated most of the time by the utility it provides, which mainly consists of crippling the enemy team with residual damage or slowing it down with Thunder Wave; however, Probopass still lacks any form of reliable recovery, so it shouldn't take unnecessary damage and get worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is an option to prevent utility Pokemon such as Grumpig from supporting their team force them to switch, or to stop slow entry hazard setters such as Golem, Quilladin, and Armaldo from setting up. Magic Coat is also viable to bounce back status moves, entry hazards, and moves such as Whirlwind or Roar. Pain Split or Chesto Berry and Rest could be used on a defensive set to give Probopass a form of recovery, though they are unreliable. Magnet Rise on an offensive set can give Probopass an immunity to Ground-type moves and allow it to check a lot of offensive threats in the tier such as Golem, Armaldo, and Marowak. Rock Polish makes Probopass an unexpected setup sweeper that can punish switches hard, finding a lot of ways to set up thanks to its high bulk and Sturdy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Floatzel, Simipour, and Politoed can tank some hits and deal massive damage to Probopass with their Water-type STAB moves, so most of the time Probopass will be forced to switch out, though they don't appreciate taking a Thunder Wave or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Marowak, Krokorok, and Camerupt don't appreciate getting hit by STAB Flash Cannon or Earth Power, but can check Probopass well by preventing it from using Volt Switch, therefore killing momentum and easily KO Probopass with their Ground-type STAB moves. Marowak is notable as it can OHKO Probopass despite Sturdy with Bonemerang.</p> <p><strong>Monferno</strong>: Monferno can easily outspeed and OHKO Probopass with Close Combat. It can also pivot into most of Probopass's attacks fairly easily save Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Coverage moves such as Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Fighting are viable on specially offensive Pokemon that could struggle against Probopass, such as Misdreavus, Kadabra, Grumpig, and Mr. Mime, but they still don't appreciate being hit by Flash Cannon most of the time. Other coverage moves such as Superpower on Stoutland threaten Probopass a lot, making Pokemon that Probopass should wall very threatening.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon, especially special walls such as Audino and Roselia, don't care about any hit from Probopass, as most of them have reliable recovery. However, Volt Switch can catch them off guard, letting Probopass pivot out to a favorable matchup.

Flash Cannon is Probopass's main STAB move and is used to hit the majority of the tier really hard, especially Fairy- and Rock-types such as Mr. Mime and Golem, respectively. Earth Power is used mainly to KO Steel-types once Probopass has trapped them with Magnet Pull; it can also be used to damage Fire-types if Probopass isn't running Power Gem. Stealth Rock deals chip damage to the foes every time they switch in, and it works well with the momentum the team gains with Volt Switch. Thunder Wave cripples and limits the potential of fast enemy Pokemon such as Kadabra and Jumpluff, which tear offensive teams apart. Power Gem is Probopass's alternate STAB move, which hits Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Fire-types such as Ninetales harder than Earth Power. Toxic is an option to rack up residual damage against bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Stunfisk and specially defensive walls in general, as Flash Cannon won't do that much to a lot of them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>172 HP EVs make Probopass a bit bulkier so it can tank a few neutral hits while running an offensive set. Maximum Special Attack investment paired with a Modest nature gives Probopass as much firepower as possible and allow it to deal significant damage and open holes in the enemy team. 84 Speed EVs make Probopass outspeed common Stealth Rock leads and pivot out from common Pokemon with 50 or less base Speed, especially special walls such as Audino. Magnet Pull is a game-changing ability, as it puts massive pressure on the Steel-type foes that can get trapped and KOed easily. Leftovers keeps Probopass healthy even as it takes Stealth Rock damage. Air Balloon is an option to have a temporary immunity to a Ground-type move, allowing Probopass to check a lot of Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a pivot because Probopass is one of the best pivots, checking special attackers such as Kadabra, Ninetales, and Misdreavus while having the ability to Volt Switch out into a more favorable matchup. Probopass should Volt Switch most of the time to gain momentum for the team, especially after it switches in on Pokemon it walls, such as Zebstrika and Chatot, as they will probably switch out. Volt Switch should not be used when the opponent carries Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves, especially Ground-types such as Stunfisk, Golem, and Gabite. Be careful when checking offensive Pokemon with this variant of Probopass, especially ones with good coverage, because its typing makes it really vulnerable to Ground- and Fighting-type coverage moves from Pokemon such as Raichu, Rapidash, and Stoutland. If the opponent has troublesome special attacking threats, such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, or Steel-type Pokemon, such as Pawniard and Klang, on their team, keep Probopass healthy to make sure it can trap them and win in 1v1 situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Steel-types, such as Jumpluff, Leafeon, Tangela, and Gourgeist-XL, are good teammates for Probopass, as many can also easily check or stall out Water- and Ground-types that trouble Probopass, such as Simipour and Stunfisk. Spikes support is good when paired with Volt Switch pressure and the decent firepower of Probopass, causing foes to take high damage when they switch out and sometimes forcing them to stay in, giving Probopass a chance to cripple them with Thunder Wave. Offensive spinblockers, such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, prevent entry hazards from being removed and also appreciate having Steel-types worn down, giving them the opportunity to run other coverage moves, as Hidden Power Fighting will be less needed. Chatot highly appreciates trapping of Steel-types, such as Probopass and Pawniard, as they can easily handle it. Slow Pokemon with an offensive presence that can make use of enemies slowed by Thunder Wave, such as Marowak and Pawniard, are also decent alongside Probopass.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock pressures the enemy team, as it deals damage to foes every time they switch in and breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy. Volt Switch makes Probopass an excellent pivot, letting it safely switch out and gain momentum and free turns for the team. Thunder Wave cripples opposing offensive Pokemon, slowing them and making them more easy to kill with a slow-paced team. Toxic puts a timer on opposing walls, forcing them to switch and take damage from Stealth Rock if they switch in again. Earth Power allows Probopass to hit Steel-type Pokemon really hard, especially other Probopass and Pawniard, but also makes Probopass setup fodder, as Earth Power is weaker than Probopass's main STAB moves. Power Gem is a STAB move that can be useful most of the time to hit Flying- and Fire-types. Flash Cannon is also a STAB move that is used to hit Fairy- and Ice-types, and it has a decent chance to lower a foe's Special Defense, usually causing them to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment and 168 Special Defense EVs allow Probopass to stay alive as long as possible, though it lacks any form of reliable recovery aside from Leftovers. The EVs also allow it to tank any hits from special attackers such as Ninetales with ease, checking and crippling them thanks to Thunder Wave or Toxic. 84 Speed EVs let Probopass outspeed slow uninvested Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Armaldo. Sturdy lets Probopass set up Stealth Rock safely and tank at least one hit most of the time. Leftovers provides Probopass with passive recovery, which helps it to make up for residual damage and keep Sturdy intact.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Probopass works best as a pivot, so try to use it to wall dangerous threats such as Zebstrika, Ninetales, and Chatot, and set up Stealth Rock or a status move to cripple the enemy team or just Volt Switch away immediately. Probopass's main priority when running a defensive set is to get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible to pressure foes, especially against Pokemon it walls, such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, and rack up more residual damage against the enemy team. Even though Probopass is known for being an excellent wall against special attackers, be wary about switching into Pokemon such as Kadabra, which might carry Hidden Power Fighting and other coverage against it. Because Probopass gives a lot of utility to a team, try to not lose it early in the battle, especially if it has to check a specific threat on the enemy team, such as Pawniard or Jumpluff, as it lacks recovery. Don't be overconfident with Sturdy if the foe can KO Probopass easily; it's nice to have guaranteed Stealth Rock or cripple a foe early, but Probopass will probably be needed throughout the game, with Sturdy also being important as a last-ditch play to cripple a setup sweeper such as Leafeon or Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On hazard-stacking teams, Spikes setters such as Roselia and Cacturne are good with Probopass to stack up residual damage along with spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist, which keep entry hazards safe from Rapid Spin. Sweepers and cleaners that appreciate Stealth Rock and Toxic residual damage, foes crippled by Thunder Wave, and being brought into the field safely thanks to Volt Switch, such as Kadabra, Regice, and Ursaring, are good teammates. Defensive teams love the support given by defensive Probopass, as it gives them a bulky Stealth Rock setter and a Pokemon that can set momentum, work as a pivot thanks to Volt Switch, and has a possibility to cripple or wear down foes with Thunder Wave and Toxic. Slow teams benefit from Thunder Wave to revenge kill threats, and Toxic fits stalling strategies well. Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL check Ground- and Water-types Pokemon for Probopass and also appreciate Volt Switch in addition to Thunder Wave and Toxic support.</p>"

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Dusknoir is able to distinguish itself from its fellow Ghost-types in the PU metagame by acting as a bulky spinblocker on offensive teams with access to both Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, as well as with a wide array of coverage moves in Ice Punch, Rock Slide, and Earthquake. Its STAB- and Life Orb-boosted Shadow Sneak supplies Dusknoir with strong counterplay against physically frail attackers like Kadabra and Mr. Mime. What's more, Sucker Punch can be used alongside Shadow Sneak in order to strike faster Normal-types such as Dodrio. Dusknoir is able to use its Ghost typing to switch into powerful Normal- and Fighting-type moves such as Chatot's Boomburst and Monferno's Close Combat in order to sponge those attacks for its teammates. Its Ghost typing can also be used to absorb Rapid Spin, meaning that in tandem with its great bulk and access to Pursuit, Dusknoir is easily able to switch into Cryogonal and Pursuit trap it in order to preserve any entry hazards that may have been set by its teammates. On the downside, the fact that it will be taking attacks from Rapid Spin users like Armaldo each time it enters the field, the possibility of entry hazards, and status effects such as burn and poison, coupled with its lack of reliable recovery, all leave Dusknoir liable to be worn down rather quickly over the course of a battle. Dusknoir also struggles against most Dark-types, as Vullaby is able to sponge Ice Punch thanks to its Eviolite-boosted bulk and strike back with Foul Play, while Pawniard can threaten it out with a faster, STAB-boosted Knock Off. Despite these shortcomings, Dusknoir's offensive presence and ability to spinblock place an enormous amount of pressure on its foes, making Dusknoir an advantageous choice for bulky offensive teams built around stacking entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Colbur Berry allows Dusknoir to lure and eliminate Dark-types like Pawniard for its teammates by tanking Knock Off and striking back with Earthquake. Assault Vest improves Dusknoir's Special Defense, which lets it take less damage from special attackers such as Zebstrika, Mr. Mime, Grumpig, and Floatzel. However, forgoing an Attack-boosting item such as Life Orb limits Dusknoir's offensive capabilities and causes it to miss out on some important OHKOs and 2HKOs. For example, it is no longer able to OHKO Soundproof Mr. Mime with a Life Orb-boosted Shadow Sneak if it uses Assault Vest, assuming no entry hazards are down on Mr. Mime's side of the field. Memento is a usable option that can be selected when Dusknoir is low on HP in order to bring in a teammate reliant on setup, like Shell Smash Gorebyss. Dusknoir is able to support slow powerhouses with Trick Room and can bring them in for free after Trick Room has been used via Memento. Pain Split supplies Dusknoir with a form of recovery that simultaneously whittles down Dusknoir's foes and is usable with its low HP stat. However, fitting Pain Split on its offensive sets is extremely difficult, given that Dusknoir would have to give up either a priority move, Pursuit, or a useful coverage option in Ice Punch or Earthquake in order to find a moveslot for Pain Split. The Attack boost from Power-Up Punch can be used to improve Dusknoir's ability to KO its foes with priority and notably allows Shadow Sneak to OHKO offensive Grumpig. Rock Slide does the same amount of damage that Ice Punch does to Vullaby and expands Dusknoir's coverage to hit Bug-types like Armaldo and Ice-types like Regice and Articuno. Focus Punch enables Dusknoir to OHKO Normal-types like Stoutland and Ursaring that may be switching into a predicted Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch, and it can be paired with Substitute in order to prevent Focus Punch from failing. Substitute also benefits Dusknoir by protecting it from status effects while easing prediction for it at the same time. Taunt prevents slower walls from healing themselves, removing entry hazards via Defog, or from crippling Dusknoir with a status effect. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types harder than any of its other offensive options can and scores the OHKO on Swanna, although if Dusknoir is staying in against bulky or faster Water-types with access to Scald, it risks being burned.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While they do not enjoy taking Earthquake from Dusknoir, Dark-types like Pawniard and Mightyena are able to outspeed Dusknoir, take very little damage from its priority moves, and KO Dusknoir with their Dark-type STAB moves, especially if they have been boosted by Swords Dance or Moxie, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: All Tangela variants, even offensive ones, are able to wall Dusknoir's Life Orb set. Vullaby checks Dusknoir with its STAB-boosted Foul Play if its Eviolite is still intact, but if Vullaby's Eviolite has been removed, Dusknoir gains the ability to 2HKO Vullaby with its Life Orb-boosted Ice Punch. Defensive Relicanth is able to avoid the 2HKO from Dusknoir's Life Orb-boosted Earthquake and can strike back with Head Smash or status it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Due to Dusknoir's lack of reliable recovery options, status users are able to whittle it down quickly. Will-O-Wisp users like Rotom-F and Misdreavus, bulky Scald users like Politoed and Lumineon, and Toxic poison from Roselia's Toxic Spikes or defensive Relicanth are all threatening to Dusknoir.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Bulky Ghost-types like Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL are able to take any hit from Dusknoir, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and hit it super effectively with Ghost-type STAB moves or Foul Play.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Sneak supplies Dusknoir with a STAB-boosted priority move, letting it bypass its poor Speed stat and strike Psychic-types like Grumpig and Kadabra super effectively. Sucker Punch provides Dusknoir with a second priority attack that is used to hit faster Normal-types like Dodrio and Chatot. It is stronger than Shadow Sneak, but its successful use is dependent on your opponent also selecting an attack. Earthquake supplies Dusknoir with great neutral coverage alongside Ice Punch and lets Dusknoir check Pokemon weak to Ground-type moves, such as Arbok, Stunfisk, and Monferno. Ice Punch hits Dragon-types like Altaria and Gabite and physically frail Grass-types like Roselia and Jumpluff much harder than its other moves would while simultaneously preventing Dusknoir from being walled by Vullaby. Pursuit is a final option that allows Dusknoir to trap physically frail Pokemon, especially Cryogonal and Kadabra, and creates a dangerous guessing game when used in tandem with Dusknoir's priority moves wherein your opponent will be forced to question whether it's safer to stay in or switch out against Dusknoir.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Its EV spread and nature maximize Dusknoir's Attack, while the given Speed lets Dusknoir outspeed neutral-natured base 50 Speed Pokemon, such as Klang and Audino. Dusknoir is able to run slightly more Speed in order to score a 2HKO on non-Eviolite Vullaby on the switch with a faster Ice Punch. Its remaining EVs should be allocated towards its bulk, which allows it to tank a wide array of neutral hits. Life Orb will boost Dusknoir's offensive presence while letting it switch between moves. Pressure is Dusknoir's only possible ability with this set because Frisk and Sucker Punch form an illegal combination together. Pressure can be used to stall out low-PP moves like Focus Blast and Superpower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dusknoir should use its Ghost typing to switch into Rapid Spin in order to preserve any entry hazards its teammates may have set. If Dusknoir is healthy and using Pursuit, it should use the opportunity after it has blocked Cryogonal's Rapid Spin in order to Pursuit trap it. Pursuit can also be used against offensive pivots reliant on Volt Switch and U-turn for the bulk of their damage, such as Zebstrika and Ninjask, as well as physically frail foes like Kadabra and Mr. Mime that would normally switch out of Dusknoir's priority moves. If a Dark- or Normal-type Pokemon is predicted to switch into Dusknoir's Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch, Dusknoir should instead attack with its coverage options; Earthquake will OHKO Pawniard and cause substantial damage to Mightyena and Normal-types on the switch, while Ice Punch is able to 2HKO Vullaby lacking Eviolite as it enters the field. Dusknoir should avoid staying in against healthy Will-O-Wisp and Scald users, as a burn is detrimental to its offensive presence. If possible, Dusknoir should be kept alive in order to provide some insurance against late-game sweepers like Rock Polish Regice and weather-based sweepers like Stoutland and Golduck via its priority moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-F is able to pressure any defensive options to Dusknoir, as its STAB-boosted Blizzard hits Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Vullaby super effectively, and its Electric-type moves are able to beat bulky Water-types that are able to threaten Dusknoir with Scald, such as Politoed, Lumineon, and Prinplup. In return, Dusknoir provides an immunity to Fighting-type moves for Rotom-F and threatens checks and counters to Rotom-F, like Grumpig and Probopass. Monferno is a great offensive partner because it is able to take on Dark-types like Pawniard and Mightyena for Dusknoir, while Dusknoir is able to reciprocate by beating Monferno's defensive answers; it handles Stunfisk with Earthquake, Altaria with Ice Punch, and Psychic-types like Grumpig and Kadabra with Pursuit and Shadow Sneak. Given Dusknoir's vulnerability to Will-O-Wisp, Fire-types that are immune to the move or can take advantage of it via Flash Fire, like Ninetales and Rapidash, are beneficial partners. Ninetales is able to OHKO bulky answers to Dusknoir such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, while Dusknoir returns the favor by beating Grumpig, Vibrava, and Altaria for Ninetales. Similarly, Pokemon with access to Facade are also good teammates for their ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp aimed at Dusknoir. Stoutland in particular is adept at taking status for Dusknoir and can break defensive walls like Vullaby that would otherwise stop Dusknoir from doing its job. Pokemon with access to Spikes, like Quilladin and Roselia, especially appreciate Dusknoir's ability to block Rapid Spin via its Ghost typing, as well as Pursuit trap Cryogonal for these Grass-types. Dusknoir is the perfect companion to leads like Weakness Policy Golem, Leavanny, and Focus Sash Rampardos for its ability to spinblock, as these types of entry hazard setters are often unable to find a second opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, or Sticky Web in Leavanny's case. Finally, Pokemon with access to Defiant are able to complete an entry hazard setting and protection core with Dusknoir by deterring Defog, so Purugly and Pawniard are ideal teammates. Additionally, both of these options resist or are immune to Ghost-type attacks aimed at Dusknoir, while in return, Dusknoir can switch into any Fighting-type moves for Purugly and Pawniard.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Sneak is Dusknoir's STAB move of choice, and the priority it receives lets Dusknoir overcome naturally faster and frail attackers like Mr. Mime. Earthquake allows Dusknoir to hit a wide range of Pokemon in PU super effectively, notably letting it check Monferno and hit Pawniard super effectively as it attempts to switch into Dusknoir's other attacks. Ice Punch deals significant damage to Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-types like Altaria, Gabite, Vibrava, Jumpluff, and Roselia. Trick in tandem with a Choice Band can cripple physically defensive walls like Tangela by locking them into a single move. Will-O-Wisp is meant to be used alongside Spell Tag and is able to whittle down bulky answers to Dusknoir, as well as mitigate damage from physical attacks aimed at Dusknoir, like Armaldo's Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Dusknoir to outspeed neutral-natured base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Prinplup and Metang, while an Adamant nature and full investment in Attack are used to maximize its offensive capabilities. The rest of its EVs are placed in HP for overall bulk. Dusknoir is able to run slightly more Speed in order to cripple Tangela by replacing its Eviolite with its own Choice Band before Dusknoir is hit by Sleep Powder. Frisk's function is twofold: more generally, it allows Dusknoir to scout out its foe's item, thereby providing extremely valuable information about the items and sets your opponent is using. Secondly, Frisk helps you choose when the best time to use Trick will be by clearly identifying the item Dusknoir will receive. If Dusknoir is using Will-O-Wisp, a Spell Tag should be used to allow Dusknoir to switch between its moves and to bluff a Choice Band while at the same time still boosting Shadow Sneak's damage output. Otherwise, Trick should be used with Choice Band.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dusknoir should switch into Rapid Spin in order to prevent entry hazards from being removed by Pokemon like Cryogonal. Similarly, its Ghost typing should also be used to absorb other Normal- and Fighting-type attacks, such as Sawsbuck's Jump Kick and Double-Edge and Grumpig's Focus Blast. Both Trick and Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple incoming defensive walls; however, giving away Dusknoir's Choice Band will decrease its offensive capabilities and may not always be the best play if the extra damage output from Choice Band is required late-game. Try to avoid revealing Dusknoir's item until Dusknoir is adequately positioned to cripple a physical attacker with Will-O-Wisp or disable an opposing wall with the combination of Trick and Choice Band.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In addition to bulkier offensive teams, Dusknoir also fits well on hyper offensive teams given its ability to spinblock, so suicide leads like Venipede and Rampardos are ideal teammates. Stealth Rock setters such as Stunfisk and Probopass are great partners that are able to handle Pawniard for Dusknoir, while in return, Dusknoir can switch into any Fighting-type hits aimed at Probopass and cripple physical attackers for Stunfisk through the use of Will-O-Wisp, thus preserving Stunfisk's bulk. Grass-type entry hazard setters like Leavanny, Quilladin, and Roselia all appreciate Dusknoir's ability to check opposing Fire-types with Earthquake and spinblock for them, and these Grass-types can return the favor by beating Scald users like Politoed, Lumineon, and Prinplup for Dusknoir.</p>"

  "Rotom-Frost": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-F's high Special Attack and almost perfect STAB coverage make it a very effective special attacker in the PU metagame. Its decent Speed and access to Volt Switch make it one of the best Choice Scarf users in the tier, as it can easily gain momentum. Rotom-F's decent natural bulk and useful ability in Levitate grant it a defensive presence that allows it to utilize its decent support options such as Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split. However, its Speed isn't always enough; it is outsped by common Pokemon such as Rapidash and Floatzel, and it's the slowest common Choice Scarf user, meaning it is easy to revenge kill. It also has to rely on Blizzard's poor accuracy, which greatly hinders its ability to revenge kill in general and hit Ground-types trying to block its Electric-type moves on the switch. Its Stealth Rock weakness and lack of reliable recovery reduce its longevity and it can be stalled out by special walls it isn't strong enough to break, such as Audino.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs could be used, as it allows Rotom-F to break through Audino and other bulky special walls, but it makes Rotom-F easy to revenge kill, and Life Orb provides enough of a power boost anyway. Rotom-F can use Will-O-Wisp on its Choice Scarf set to annoy certain Pokemon but the option is generally outclassed by its other moves. Expert Belt and Wide Lens are viable item choices to bluff a Choice Scarf and lure certain Pokemon. Finally, Hex can be used in combination with Will-O-Wisp to heavily damage Grumpig.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chinchou is Rotom-F's best counter, taking little from any of its moves and only fearing being Tricked a Choice Scarf. Audino takes any hit from Rotom-F easily and can Heal Bell and Wish off any damage or status while crippling it with Encore. Grumpig also takes little from Rotom-F's attacks and can heal burns with Heal Bell but lacks any sort of reliable recovery and can be worn down by Thunderbolt, especially from Life Orb variants. However, like Chinchou, neither appreciates being Tricked a Choice Scarf. Bronzor and Clefairy can wall most Rotom-F variants and only need to fear Trick, while having the added benefit of not being worn down by entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Rotom-F is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to Toxic and burns, and Substitute sets generally need to set up Substitutes multiple throughout a match, meaning that Rotom-F can be worn down over the course of longer matches.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Electric</strong>: Although they dislike Blizzard, Ground-types and Lightning Rod users such as Golem and Raichu prevent Rotom-F from spamming Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and get a free turn whenever Rotom-F is locked into one of them. Seaking also resists Blizzard and can wear Rotom-F down and remove its Leftovers with Knock Off, but without Rest it can't heal burns from SubWisp Rotom-F.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon such as Rapidash, Ninetales, and Ursaring all outspeed non-Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-F and can OHKO it or force it out. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime and Chatot can also KO Rotom-F, although they have issues switching in.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch provides momentum on the switches Rotom-F often forces and hits fairly hard. Blizzard provides almost perfect neutral coverage with Rotom-F's Electric-type STAB moves, hitting Grass- and Ground-types for super effective damage, but Rotom-F has to be cautious, as the move has bad accuracy. Thunderbolt provides a stronger, more reliable STAB move that doesn't force Rotom-F out. Trick cripples specially defensive walls and other switch-ins such as Clefairy and Bronzor. Hidden Power Ice can be used as it provides a more accurate Ice-type move that allows Rotom-F to reliably revenge kill weakened threats weak to Ice such as Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature allow Rotom-F to outspeed as many foes and deal as much damage as possible. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-F to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, making it an effective revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-F's primary use is as a revenge killer; its high Special Attack and strong STAB moves allow it to revenge kill Pokemon such as Gorebyss, Simipour, and Jumpluff. Volt Switch is its main move, as it allows it to gain momentum against a Pokemon switching out. It is generally safe to use, as Blizzard usually deters Ground-types from switching in. Rotom-F should be careful about locking itself into Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice, as Pokemon that resist them can then use Rotom-F as setup fodder. Trick should be used on switches to bulky Pokemon that wall Rotom-F, such as Audino, but that may not be the best decision if Rotom-F is still needed as a revenge killer. Although it has decent natural bulk, Rotom-F doesn't have the longevity to switch into hits; it is better switched in from other pivots or after a KO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard users such as Smeargle and Roselia make effective teammates because Rotom-F forces many switches, allowing it to rack up hazard and Volt Switch damage. Misdreavus keeps hazards on the field decently, fits well on offensive teams, and is immune to Fighting. Water-types such as Politoed have nice synergy with Rotom-F, as they can beat Rock-types and Fire-types, while Rotom-F can check Grass- and Electric-types. Pelipper and Vibrava are great too for Defog support, which is very important as Rotom-F is weak to Stealth Rock and switches in a lot. U-turn users such as Purugly also make for great partners as they keep up momentum and create a VoltTurn core with Rotom-F. Checks to Golem and other Ground-types, such as Leafeon, can help bail Rotom-F out of situations where it mispredicts with Volt Switch. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland can help punish specially defensive Pokemon such as Chinchou looking to counter Rotom-F.</p>"
      },
      "SubWisp": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute can easily be set up versus many weaker attackers in the tier and makes Rotom-F much harder to revenge kill. Will-O-Wisp cripples switch-ins such as Grumpig and Assault Vest Bouffalant, as well as preventing weaker foes from breaking Rotom-F's Substitute. It is also Rotom-F's best way to damage Seaking. Thunderbolt and Blizzard give Rotom-F perfect neutral coverage while threatening Flying-, Grass-, Ground-, and Water-types, making it incredibly difficult to switch into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Rotom-F to outspeed as many foes as possible and keep its Substitute up more reliably. Leftovers provides passive recovery to let Rotom-F set up as many Substitutes as possible over longer battles. Maximum Special Attack investment helps Rotom-F deal as much damage as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-F can set up Substitutes on Pokemon it forces out, such as Roselia and Stunfisk. Use Substitute on switches when you predict your opponent to sacrifice something or send in a Pokemon that lowers its stats with its attacks, such as Close Combat Monferno. Attacking is safer when facing Pokemon such as Ninjask and Chatot that can hit Rotom-F through its Substitute. Use Will-O-Wisp versus anything that Rotom-F cannot 2HKO to cripple them so that they can't force Rotom-F out the next time it gets a Substitute. However, be careful of giving free switches to Facade users such as Ursaring, Flash Fire Pokemon such as Ninetales, and Pokemon that have already been inflicted with status. Attempt to bring Rotom-F in multiple times over longer games, as it can wear down nearly all of its checks given enough time. Be wary of losing all of Blizzard's limited PP, which leaves Rotom-F open to being stalled out by Grass- and Ground-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal helps preserve Rotom-F's health and gives it more opportunities to set up Substitute. Pokemon that can take on Audino, such as Stoutland and Monferno, help handle Rotom's best counter. Checks to Fire-types, such as Floatzel and Grumpig, can help handle Rotom-F's main checks such as Ninetales, and sweepers such as Regice and Pawniard can clean more effectively once Rotom-F has broken down walls. Krokorok is an excellent partner as it can Pursuit trap Bronzor and Knock Off Clefairy's Eviolite. Other stallbreaking teammates such as Nasty Plot Mr. Mime can help make up for Rotom-F being unable to break through some common defensive Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is the main move on the set, as Rotom-F forces a lot of switches due to the nature of its STAB moves and its likelihood of carrying a Choice item. Behind a Substitute, Rotom-F is protected from potential revenge killers as well as weak walls such as Vibrava, which can't even break the Substitute. It also pairs wonderfully with Pain Split, which helps it beat Pokemon such as Audino. Blizzard is Rotom-F's strongest attack and hits almost everything that doesn't resist it very hard. Thunderbolt has almost perfect coverage with Blizzard, hitting bulky Water-types that can take a Blizzard easily. Pain Split helps Rotom-F recover HP thanks to its low HP stat and also pressures walls such as Audino into using Wish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment increase Rotom-F's offensive potential, letting it outspeed as much of the metagame as possible and hit hard. Life Orb gives Rotom-F just enough of an attack boost to allow it to wallbreak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Substitute is the primary move to go for, as Rotom-F forces many switches, and Substitute blocks status and weaker moves. Pain Split should be used when Rotom-F is low on health against bulky walls such as Audino. Be careful when using Substitute while getting low on health against stronger Pokemon, as they can pressure Rotom-F, preventing it from using Pain Split. Try to keep Rotom-F's item unrevealed until it is time to attack, as it can easily force out Pokemon with the threat of its Choice Scarf set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support in the form of both Spikes and Stealth Rock from Pokemon such as Golem and Quilladin is very useful, as Rotom-F forces a lot of switches. Misdreavus acts as a spinblocker and also has decent synergy with Rotom-F, being immune to Fighting-type attacks aimed at it. Late-game sweepers such as Regice and Choice Scarf Dodrio appreciate Rotom-F's wallbreaking potential. Even with Pain Split Rotom-F can have a hard time breaking through Bronzor, so Knock Off users such as Leafeon and Pursuit users such as Pawniard can be useful.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-S is overshadowed by Rotom-F as an offensive Electric-type due to worse coverage between its STAB moves and the low Base Power of Air Slash. However, Rotom-S sports a decent defensive typing that, when combined with access to Will-O-Wisp and a decent Speed tier, allows it to check Grass-, Flying-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Leafeon, Dodrio, and Monferno. Unfortunately, a weakness to the ever-present Stealth Rock as well as an inability to touch Electric-types hinders Rotom-S greatly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-S can use a Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer, but this is outclassed by Rotom-F due to its inability to hit Ground-types and is generally not worth it unless you need a fast Pokemon that resists Mach Punch. Choice Specs is an option for Rotom-S to act as more of a wallbreaker, but this is done better by Rotom-F for the same reason. It can also be more easily taken advantage of by fast Pokemon. Physically defensive Rotom-S is an option to take less damage from the Pokemon it checks, but it needs speed to effectively act as a check and is hampered by Stealth Rock more.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-S cannot touch walls like Audino and Clefairy, giving them free reign to whittle Rotom-S down while keeping their health up, and some bulky setup sweepers, like Duosion and Klang, easily set up on Rotom-S.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Rotom-F resist Rotom-S's STAB move combination and can fire off powerful Electric-type attacks that are neutral due to Rotom-S's typing or attack with super effective coverage, preventing Rotom-S from being an effective check.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Common Ice-type Pokemon such as Glaceon, Regice, and Articuno can all either outspeed Rotom-S or take any attack from it and then retaliate with super effective Ice-type attacks, all of which OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Although very few faster threats can OHKO Rotom-S without prior damage, it is slow, is weak to common coverage of revenge killers, and has subpar bulk, which leaves it easily revenge killed after one or two rounds of Stealth Rock damage by attacks like Ice Beam from Floatzel and Flare Blitz from Rapidash.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Rotom-S's strongest attacking move, doing decent damage to most foes that don't resist it. Volt Switch is a less powerful option than Thunderbolt but allows Rotom-S to pivot out of bad matchups. Air Slash hits the Grass-types that resist Electric in addition to landing the OHKO on Monferno. Hidden Power Water is the best option Rotom has to hit Ground-types such as Golem and Hippopotas. Hidden Power Water is chosen over Hidden Power Grass in order to 2HKO specially defensive Camerupt. Will-O-Wisp weakens physical attackers and deals residual damage. Pain Split is an option over Will-O-Wisp or Hidden Power Water that gives Rotom-S another way to heal, but it takes away its ability to cripple physical attackers or hit Ground-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack allow Rotom-S to hit as hard as possible. 224 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Rotom-S to outspeed Jolly Monferno, Adamant Stoutland, and Timid Grumpig. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to make Rotom-S slightly bulkier. Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature can be run in order to outspeed Timid Articuno and Timid Misdreavus as well as Speed tie other Rotom formes. Leftovers keeps Rotom-S healthy and slightly mitigates Stealth Rock and other residual damage. A spread of 248 HP / 36 SpA / 224 Spe along with a Timid nature can make Rotom-S bulkier at the cost of some of its attacking power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>During the early-game, Rotom-S should be used to break down slower Pokemon and walls such as Stunfisk with a combination of its attacks and burns from Will-O-Wisp. It is important to maximize Rotom-S's bulk, so try to avoid switching it into Stealth Rock if possible. After burning a foe with Will-O-Wisp, Volt Switch out into a Pokemon that can better handle the foe, especially if in a bad matchup. However, be wary of wearing Rotom-S down too much when Stealth Rock is on the field. Try to avoid switching Rotom-S into offensively oriented Pokemon, as they can heavily dent it and severely reduce its longevityâ€”instead, switch it into slower Pokemon that it checks, such as Pawniard and Cacturne.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-S hates switching into Stealth Rock, so it appreciates Defog support from Pokemon such as Lumineon and Prinplup. Powerful wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Leafeon can help break down specially defensive walls that Rotom-S can't touch. Pokemon that resist Ice such as Monferno and Thick Fat Grumpig take pressure off of Rotom-S. Pokemon such as Chinchou and Stunfisk help absorb hits from offensive Electric-types. Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Quilladin and Tangela can switch into Ground-type Pokemon that Rotom-S is unable to hit. Pokemon that appreciate Ground-types being weakened, such as Pawniard and Mawile, make good partners for Rotom-S, as they can also break down walls for Rotom-S. Rotom-S fits best on offense or bulky offense teams that need a Monferno and/or a Sucker Punch user check.</p>"

  "Regigigas": {
    "overview": "<p>Regigigas carries utility moves such as Thunder Wave and Knock Off and has really high bulk, making it viable on balanced and bulky offense teams that need both utility and backup to deal with strong attackers. Unfortunately, Regigigas's main and most known flaw is its ability, Slow Start, as it halves its Speed and Attack for five turns, holding it back from being able to perform purely offensive sets. Regigigas's Normal typing also doesn't help at all with performing a defensively oriented set, as it doesn't give it any weaknesses or any resistances. The immunity to Ghost-types isn't that useful, as Misdreavus, the most common Ghost-type, usually carries Will-O-Wisp or Taunt, so it is able to reduce Regigigas's utility options and offensive presence. Regigigas's lack of recovery outside from Leftovers is yet another drawback, as it limits its switch-in opportunities and doesn't allow it to constantly check attackers. That also makes Regigigas really susceptible to entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, which make Regigigas's job as a wall even harder to accomplish.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used, as Regigigas's Special Attack isn't affected by Slow Start, and it has access to good coverage options such as Focus Blast and Thunderbolt, though other Choice Specs users such as Floatzel and Chatot are often preferred. Power-Up Punch can be used to squeeze in Attack boosts against weak attackers and make up a bit for Slow Start. Toxic can be used as an alternative to Thunder Wave, and it comes in handy to cripple bulky Pokemon that Regigigas can't get past, such as Vullaby and Gourgeist-XL. Headbutt can be used over Return to make the foe have a high chance of being immobilized along with Thunder Wave, stalling out Slow Start turns, though it's rather risky and Regigigas will lose some power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Bulky Rock-types, such as defensive Relicanth, Golem, and Armaldo, can all tank a few hits from Regigigas and can cripple it with Toxic, set up Stealth Rock, or use it as a setup fodder, although though most of them don't like getting hit by Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Most offensive Rock-types take significant damage from Drain Punch, but they can check Substitute sets fairly well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Monferno, Dodrio, and Choice Band Krokorok can abuse Regigigas's lack of recovery and weakness while Slow Start is active to deal massive damage. However, most do not appreciate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave or losing their item due to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Probopass, Pawniard, and Klang resist and take next to no damage from Regigigas's main STAB attack and can take advantage of it by setting up Stealth Rock or using Regigigas as a setup fodder, though most of them don't appreciate getting paralyzed or hit by Knock Off. Probopass and Pawniard also don't like getting hit by Drain Punch, which is doubly super effective against them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, make Regigigas easy to wear down because of its lack of reliable recovery, while status ailments such as burn and paralysis cripple Regigigas and make it setup fodder for setup sweepers that can dodge Thunder Wave such as Substitute + Nasty Plot Simipour.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Regigigas's strongest STAB move, providing decent neutral coverage. Knock Off provides both utility and coverage, allowing Regigigas to cripple foes, especially Eviolite users such as Clefairy and Roselia, and hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Duosion and Misdreavus for high damage. Thunder Wave enables Regigigas to support slow teammates such as Bouffalant and Stoutland, and it can cripple most fast attackers and setup sweepers, such as Jumpluff and Regice. Drain Punch is used to give Regigigas a source of recovery and more coverage, as it allows Regigigas to hit Steel- and Rock-types, such as Probopass, Golem, and Pawniard, which resist Return and take little damage from Knock Off. Substitute can be set up against weak attackers and, along with Thunder Wave, allows Regigigas to stall out its Slow Start.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs allow Regigigas to survive as long as possible and tank both physical and special attacks. Maximum investment into Attack along with an Adamant nature are used to deal as much damage as possible. Leftovers gives Regigigas passive recovery and allows it to set up more than four consecutive Substitutes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Regigigas should be used as a utility-focused Pokemon rather than an attacker thanks to its high bulk along with its access to utility moves such as Knock Off and Thunder Wave. Regigigas should use Thunder Wave a lot early-game to cripple foes and let teammates find setup opportunities and open spaces for a sweep from the start, letting Regigigas get an early lead. After a foe gets paralyzed, Regigigas could set up Substitute and try to stall out Slow Start, but it still has to be wary about its HP not getting too low. Regigigas should be brought in against weak attackers that aren't able to break its Substitute, such as Stunfisk and Audino, or against others such as Ninetales and Jumpluff to try paralyzing them with Thunder Wave. Regigigas should not be brought onto the field when Toxic Spikes are on its side or when it's against status users, such as Misdreavus, Tangela, and Gabite, as they can cripple Regigigas, limiting its switch-in opportunities and effectiveness as a wall. Clefairy can work as a backup for Monferno, which are able to KO Regigigas with ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Regigigas fits best on defensively oriented and bulky offense teams, as it can provide both utility to support teammates and a backup for strong attackers. Entry hazard removal provided by Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Vibrava and Cryogonal is appreciated, as Regigigas doesn't carry any reliable recovery and struggles against entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Roselia is a good partner for Regigigas, as it can set up Toxic Spikes, which works well along Substitute stalling, and it can put foes to sleep, which also helps with stalling Slow Start turns. Roselia is also able to absorb Toxic Spikes, which trouble Regigigas. Pokemon that can deal with other Fighting-types, such as Combusken and Monferno, are good partners along with Regigigas, though some of them don't appreciate getting hit by Knock Off. Examples include Clefairy and Grumpig. Fighting-types such as Monferno, Ground-types such as Gabite, and bulky Water-types such as Politoed are able to take on Steel- and Rock-types such as Pawniard and Probopass for Regigigas, which is important because Regigigas won't always run a coverage move to hit them. Regigigas suffers from status ailments such as burn and poison, so clerics such as Grumpig are decent along with it. Wish support from Pokemon such as Hypno and Audino can help Regigigas make up for its lack of recovery and let it survive for longer during a game. Teammates that take advantage of Thunder Wave utility provided by Regigigas are good partners. Examples are slow sweepers and cleaners, such as Stoutland and Mightyena.</p>"

  "Phione": {
    "overview": "<p>Phione is a mediocre Pokemon in PU, as it is outclassed as an offensive Water-type by Simipour, Floatzel, and Basculin to name a few due to their better offenses. Because of this, Phione is limited to a role as a weather setter, but it is outclassed in this regard as well by Volbeat and Relicanth, the former of which has access to Prankster as well as other supporting moves such as Thunder Wave and Encore, and the latter of which has access to Stealth Rock and higher offensive capabilities. However, Phione's access to Hydration combined with Rest can keep it healthy when it is raining, allowing it to set rain up again if need be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can cripple bulkier Pokemon such as Politoed and Pelipper, which don't mind taking a Scald. A Life Orb set is an option, but it is outclassed by other Water-types in the metagame such as Simipour and Floatzel, so it is best to stick with Rain Dance support. Heal Bell can cure Phione's teammates from status conditions, but it doesn't have the space for it. Knock Off can cripple Pokemon such as Roselia, removing its Eviolite, which can make it easier for Phione's teammates to take out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Tangela, Simisage, and Jumpluff can scare out Phione with their Grass-type STAB attacks, but the latter two must be wary about switching into Scald, as it can possibly burn them. Roselia, however, couldn't care less about getting burned by Scald and can proceed to set up Spikes or attack Phione with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika can easily overwhelm Phione with their Electric-type attacks and gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks</strong>: Phione isn't the bulkiest Pokemon even with investment, so Pokemon such as Regice and Floatzel can attack Phione on its uninvested Special Defense stat and possibly 2HKO it. Pokemon that can take advantage of being burned by Scald, including Facade users such as Stoutland and Ursaring, can take out Phione with ease.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Politoed and Pelipper can take a Scald with relative ease and retaliate with attacks of their own or, in Pelipper's case, heal itself with Roost.</p>",

      "Rain Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance is beneficial for Pokemon with Swift Swim such as Armaldo and Golduck, as it doubles their Speed. Rest restores Phione's health, with Hydration, curing the sleep immediately. Scald is Phione's Water-type STAB attack and is very useful for attempting to burn physical attackers such as Dodrio. U-turn gives Phione a way to pivot to a teammate after it has done its job of setting rain up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense combined with a Relaxed nature makes Phione as bulky as possible to take physical hits better. A Relaxed nature is used with 0 Speed IVs to provide teammates with a slow U-turn so they can come in unscathed. Damp Rock is the preferred item, as it increases the duration of rain from five turns to eight.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Phione is best used as a lead to get rain up early to support its teammates. Set up Rain Dance against Pokemon that it can force out such as Golem and Crustle, as they wouldn't like to take a Scald. Rest should be used while it is raining to keep Phione healthy in case it has to set up rain again later on in the match. After rain has been set up, Phione should try to U-turn to a Swift Swim teammate such as Golduck so it can take advantage of the rain. Phione can also be preserved for the late-game to set up rain if need be.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set only fits on rain teams, and therefore Swift Swim Pokemon such as Golduck, Armaldo, Floatzel, and Beartic are good teammates, as they appreciate the rain support Phione provides. Other rain setters such as Volbeat, Electrode, and Relicanth ease the pressure off Phione to set up rain repeatedly. Other Water-types such as Simipour appreciate the boost to their Water-type STAB attacks in the rain as well. Swanna also appreciates firing off its perfect-accuracy Hurricane in the rain, which also heals it of status thanks to Hydration. Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu can use the rain to their advantage by firing off a powerful STAB Thunder that doesn't miss in the rain. Grass-types such as Tangela, Gogoat, and Jumpluff can handle opposing Water-types for Phione. They also appreciate the rain, as it weakens Fire-type attacks aimed at them.</p>"

  "Servine": {
    "overview": "<p>The only viable Contrary user that PU has to offer, Servine's combination of good mixed bulk, a decent Speed tier, and a STAB move that boosts its Special Attack two stages make it a threatening Pokemon for many balanced teams to deal with. Unfortunately, Servine is relatively predictable, due to a limited number of possible set variations. As such, Servine is hard walled by a number of very common metagame threats such as Muk and Altaria, as well as by most Fire-types. Servine's uninvested base 60 Special Attack stat is very low for an offensive Pokemon, and thus Servine can be weak, even after a Leaf Storm boost. Leaf Storm also suffers from a low number of PP, and seeing that it is usually Servine's only STAB move, it must be used wisely in order to not risk running out. Lastly, Servine suffers competition from other Grass-types. Offensive Grass-types such as Simisage offer more immediate breaking power, more coverage, and a better Speed tier. Defensive Pokemon such as Tangela and Quilladin possess better defensive abilities and more bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Eviolite or Leftovers from defensive Pokemon, making them easier to break through. It can also remove damage-boosting items such as Stoutland's Choice Band, which is useful, since Stoutland cannot 2HKO Servine without its Choice Band equipped. Glare can be used as a form of speed control, crippling faster offensive Pokemon. Taunt enables Servine to better handle defensive Pokemon such as Calm Mind Clefairy or Grumpig with Calm Mind or a status-inflicting move. Giga Drain can be used to give Servine a secondary Grass STAB move, making up for Leaf Storm's low PP, while Hidden Power Ice can also be run in that slot to nail would-be counter Altaria. A Choice Scarf set is also a possibility. However, Servine's only average base Speed, leaving it outsped by other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Dodrio, combined with the fact that Servine is somewhat weak without boosts means that this set is usually underwhelming.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rapidash, Ninetales, and Simisear all resist Leaf Storm and are immune to or resist Hidden Power Fire. They all outspeed Servine and can OHKO it with their Fire-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Curse Muk is the single hardest counter to Servine that exists, taking next to nothing from any of its attacks and dealing heavy damage with Poison Jab. Arbok can also be used as an offensive check, since it resists Leaf Storm and threatens Servine with Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Articuno outspeeds Servine and resists its STAB Leaf Storm, threatening it in return with moves such as Hurricane, Ice Beam, and Freeze-Dry. Rotom-F acts as an offensive check with both its Choice Scarf and Substitute sets, which both outspeed Servine and threaten to OHKO it with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Dodrio, Ninjask, and Jumpluff can deal big damage to Servine with their STAB moves. Ninjask and Jumpluff also have the Infiltrator ability, allowing them to hit Servine through its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper</strong>: With their ability granting them an immunity to Grass-type moves, Bouffalant, Gogoat, and Sliggoo are all solid defensive answers to Servine. Zebstrika can act as an offensive check, although it can be worn down by Life Orb, entry hazards, or simply switching into Hidden Power Fire.</p>",

      "Substitute + Synthesis": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Servine's main STAB move, increasing its Special Attack by two stages while also being a generally powerful attack. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel- and Grass-types such as Pawniard, Metang, and Leafeon. Substitute allows Servine to set up on weaker attacks such as Audino's Knock Off, Clefairy's Moonblast, and Duosion's Psyshock, but it can also be set up on forced switches when facing Pokemon such as Golem and Relicanth. Synthesis keeps Servine healthy. Servine's HP investment in combination with Eviolite makes it somewhat bulky in comparison to other offensive Pokemon, making it potentially tough to KO in combination with Synthesis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment gives Servine good mixed bulk, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Mr. Mime. Maximum Speed investment allows Servine to outspeed offensive Pokemon such as Gabite and Monferno. Contrary is Servine's ability of choice, enabling it to act as a threatening wallbreaker when facing balanced teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Servine comes in relatively freely on Water- and Ground-types, as long as you are wary of Toxic or Scald burns, and can proceed to force them out, setting up a Substitute or pressuring the defensive Pokemon that is switched in with Leaf Storm. Don't bother using Leaf Storm if a Muk, Bouffalant, or Altaria is still on the opposing team. Pokemon such as those will easily wall Servine no matter how many boosts it acquires, so it is in your best interest not to waste the limited Leaf Storm PP that you have available. Servine possesses the ability to handle a decent number of offensive Pokemon, avoiding the 2HKO from offensive threats such as Choice Specs Mr. Mime, so don't be afraid to switch it in in situations like this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stoutland can be used to bust through the special walls that Servine cannot break while also boasting the ability to Pursuit trap faster offensive threats that Servine may struggle with. In return, Servine deals with bulky Rock- and Ground-types such as Golem, Relicanth, and Stunfisk while also setting up on Gourgeist and Vullaby. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Relicanth and Golem can be useful to wear down Fire-types as well as Muk. SpeedPass Combusken is a good partner for Servine, as it appreciates the extra Speed to deal with offensive Pokemon such as Floatzel and Dodrio.</p>"

This, combined with its mediocre all-around stats, prevents Watchog from being an effective wallbreaker. Watchog's terrible defenses, below-average Speed for a wallbreaker, and need to take a hit for Analytic to take effect makes Watchog easy to to wear down or KO with a strong attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gunk Shot is an option to hit Grass- and Fairy-types, such as Tangela and Clefairy harder. Hypnosis can put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, but its accuracy is unreliable. Toxic can cripple physical walls such as Gourgeist-XL, while Thunder Wave can slow down faster threats such as Rapidash and Simisage. Super Fang can be used in conjunction with Toxic to quickly wear down bulkier foes, but Watchog doesn't have the moveslot, much less the bulk, to pull this off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Monferno can outspeed Watchog and easily OHKO it with Close Combat although it cannot switch into Watchog reliably.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Watchog isn't very fast or bulky, so any Pokemon that can outspeed it and deal heavy damage to it are good ways to handle it. Some examples of these include Quick Feet Ursaring, Simipour, and Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Gourgeist-XL can take a hit from Watchog, cripple Watchog with a burn by means of Will-O-Wisp and recover any lost health with Synthesis. Tangela can also take any attack from Watchog with relative ease and simply attack with Giga Drain, but it doesn't appreciate having its Eviolite removed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Being burned can easily render Watchog useless, while being poisoned puts Watchog on a timer. Examples of Pokemon capable of inflicting such status include Misdreavus and Dusknoir. Watchog is also hampered by all forms of entry hazards, which, when combined with Life Orb recoil, can easily wear down Watchog to the point where it can be picked off by priority attacks such as Mightyena's Sucker Punch and Floatzel's Aqua Jet.</p>",

Seed Bomb specifically hits Golem and Relicanth, which can otherwise set up on Watchog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed along with an Adamant nature allow Watchog to deal the most possible damage while outspeeding as many Pokemon as possible. A Jolly nature can be run, however, to outspeed Pokemon such as Stoutland, Articuno, Golduck outside of rain, and Arbok. Life Orb powers up all of Watchog's attacks at the cost of some health. Analytic provides an additional boost to the power of Watchog's attacks if it moves after the foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Watchog is, first and foremost, a wallbreaker, so it is best used early in the match to deal out heavy damage to the opponent's team, making it easier for its teammates to clean up. Watchog should avoid coming in on strong attacks due to its bad defensive typing and poor bulk. Instead, Watchog should come in after a teammate has fainted or from a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Lumineon. Keep Watchog away from status conditions, such as burn and poison, as they put a damper on its ability to wallbreak.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Watchog appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Probopass, Roselia, and Stunfisk, as it aids Watchog in netting KOs, including a guaranteed OHKO on Regice after Stealth Rock with Low Kick. Paralysis and Sticky Web support from Pokemon such as Grumpig and Leavanny can help Watchog outspeed faster threats. Flying- and Psychic-types such as Dodrio and Kadabra can eliminate Fighting-types such as Monferno for Watchog.  Pokemon that can provide slow pivot support such as Probopass are appreciated to prevent Watchog from taking any damage on the switch in. Setup sweepers such as Ninetales and Simipour appreciate Watchog's ability to wear down foes like Audino.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland is able to distinguish itself from other Pokemon in the PU metagame with its high Attack stat, good bulk, and access to great abilities in Scrappy and Sand Rush. Thanks to Scrappy, Stoutland is a fearsome wallbreaker due to the fact that it isn't forced to predict around Ghost-types and can use its Normal-type STAB moves freely. Stoutland can also take advantage of Sand Rush to double its Speed under sandstorm, making it an incredibly fast and strong sweeper. These two abilities make Stoutland very effective against defensive and offensive teams, respectively. Stoutland also has great natural bulk, meaning it can avoid being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Zebstrika. On the downside, Stoutland faces  competition from Dodrio, which is faster and has access to a stronger secondary STAB move in Brave Bird, and Bouffalant, which can break through certain Normal checks better with Swords Dance and Earthquake. Stoutland also has a mediocre Speed tier meaning it can easily be revenge killed by Pokemon such as Leafeon and Monferno.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is an option that allows Stoutland to take on faster Pokemon that would normally outspeed it such as Floatzel and Jumpluff. Work Up can be used to boost Stoutland's Attack stat, though Stoutland is easily revenge killed because of its relatively low Speed. Sleep Talk can be used if nothing else on your team can switch into Sleep Powder. Silk Scarf is another option that, at the cost of power, allows Stoutland to switch moves freely while also bluffing Choice Band. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon such as Tangela as they switch in, making them easier to take on later in the battle. Wild Charge can be used to get a stronger hit against Prinplup, Swanna, and Lumineon, but is a poor move to be locked into. Intimidate defensive sets with Rest and Sleep Talk have some surprise factor, but are ultimately outclassed by bulkier Normal-types like Audino.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Tangela and Gourgeist-XL can take multiple hits from Stoutland, recover their health, damage or cripple it with a status move such as Sleep Powder or damage it with an attack such as Foul Play. Stunfisk is also able to take a couple of hits with a physically defensive spread and set up Stealth Rock or try to do some damage to Stoutland with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Solrock, Probopass, Relicanth and Golem resist Stoutland's STAB moves and can stop the spamming of Return, but need to predict correctly as the former is 2HKOed by Crunch and the others cannot switch into Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metang and Klang resist Stoutland's STAB moves and don't take too much damage from its coverage moves. The former can use Pursuit in order to get off chip damage against Stoutland, while the latter can use Stoutland as setup fodder if it is locked into a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that outspeed Stoutland such as Floatzel, Monferno, and Chatot can take advantage of Stoutland's low Speed and deal a lot of damage to it, although Stoutland can usually take any one hit and KO them in return.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Stoutland's strongest and most spammable STAB move and is extremely difficult to switch into. Facade prevents Stoutland from being crippled by moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic while even punishing the use of these moves by giving it an even stronger STAB move once inflicted by status. Superpower deals a lot of damage to Steel- and Rock-types such as Probopass and Golem. Crunch allows Stoutland to deal more damage to Solrock and Metang, both of which are strong checks to Stoutland. Pursuit is another option that allows Stoutland to deal a lot of damage to Pokemon that it threatens out, even KOing Pokemon such as Grumpig if they switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scrappy allows Stoutland to hit Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL with Normal-type moves. Maximum Attack investment along with a Choice Band and an Adamant nature are used to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment allows Stoutland to outspeed all relatively slow Pokemon such as Cacturne and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stoutland should mainly spam Return and Facade, although if the opponent has a Steel- or Rock-type such as Probopass, Stoutland can use Superpower in order to pick up a KO; however, be wary of locking Stoutland into a move that is resisted by another opposing Pokemon, as Stoutland can then be taken advantage of. Stoutland can be switched into status-inducing moves such as Toxic in order to boost the damage output of Facade, though the negatives sometimes outweigh the positives when it comes to the status infliction. Stoutland can be switched into weaker attacks such as Clefairy's Moonblast and defensive Roselia's Giga Drain, though it should be wary of being worn down. Be wary of using Superpower, as setup sweepers such as Huntail can take advantage of the Attack drop.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slower Pokemon with access to Volt Switch and U-turn such as Probopass and Pelipper can be used to get Stoutland into the field of play without having to take unnecessary damage. Sweepers such as Combusken and Jumpluff appreciate Stoutland's wallbreaking capabilities, as they make it easier for them to sweep. Healing Wish support from Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Clefairy can be helpful to fully revive Stoutland after it has been worn down or severely weakened. Sticky Web support from Smeargle can slow down foes, making it easier for Stoutland to sweep through opposing teams. Knock Off users such as Leafeon can help to cripple checks like Vullaby and Tangela and remove Leftovers from Pokemon such as Mawile.</p>"

      "Sand Rush": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Stoutland's most spammable STAB move and is extremely hard to switch into. Superpower allows Stoutland to hit Steel- and Rock-types such as Probopass and Golem, which resist Return. Crunch allows Stoutland to hit Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL, which are immune to both Return and Superpower. Facade is used in the last slot so that Stoutland can take advantage of Toxic and Will-o-Wisp by acting as a status absorber.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature along with maximum Attack investment and a Choice Band allows Stoutland to hit as hard as possible, while Life Orb allows Stoutland to spam its STAB moves without having to predict, at the cost of taking recoil after every attack. While sand is active, maximum Speed investment along with Sand Rush allows Stoutland to outspeed the entire unboosted PU metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Once sand has been set up, Stoutland should be brought in as soon as possible to take full advantage of sand turns. In order to keep sand present, make sure to keep Hippopotas alive as long as possible. Hippopotas can be sacrificed late-game, giving Stoutland a free switch in and a chance to sweep. Stoutland shouldn't be switched directly into strong attacks; instead, it should be brought in after a Pokemon has been KOed or on a double switch. Opponents may try to switch around Stoutland to waste turns of sand, so you can predict what Pokemon your opponent will switch in in order to limit this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippopotas is a mandatory partner for Stoutland, as it is the only Pokemon in PU that can provide Stoutland with sand thanks to its access to Sand Stream. Rock-types such as Relicanth can get a Special Defense boost from the sand, making them good partners on a sand team. Water- and Grass-types such as Floatzel and Roselia are important in taking on Hippopotas's checks, making it easier to keep it alive throughout the battle.</p>"

  "Simisage": {
    "overview": "<p>Simisage has a very good combination of both Speed and power, but it faces competition from other physical Grass-types in the metagame, such as Leafeon and Jumpluff, in terms of Speed and bulk. Simisage has a niche in PU as a mixed attacker, Choice Scarf revenge killer, or a Nasty Plot sweeper, setting it apart from the other Grass-types in the metagame. This, combined with its vast movepool to accommodate its base 98 Attack and Special Attack, makes Simisage very threatening. However, Simisage's low defenses with its exploitable weaknesses such as Fire and Ice, susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards, and reliance on Life Orb mean that it can be worn down fairly easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Work Up boosts Simisage's Attack and Special Attack, but it's outdone by Nasty Plot. Rock Slide hits Vullaby harder than anything else Simisage has, but lacks the raw power of Gunk Shot. Taunt or Bullet Seed allow Simisage to function as an anti-lead versus Pokemon such as Quilladin and Golem, but Simisage often lacks the moveslot for them. Salac Berry can be run to allow Simisage to act as a revenge killer once all faster threats and priority users are removed. Acrobatics can catch opposing Grass-types off guard if you're running it with a Substitute + Salac Berry set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Roselia, Tangela, and Gourgeist can easily survive a hit even after a Nasty Plot boost and OHKO back. Roselia can proceed to KO Simisage with Sludge Bomb or set up spikes as Simisage switches out, Tangela often carries Hidden Power Ice or Sludge Bomb for opposing Grass-types, and Gourgeist can survive a Knock Off and proceed to cripple Simisage with Will-O-Wisp. Jumpluff outspeeds Simisage without a Choice Scarf and can OHKO it with Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash can KO Simisage with their respective STAB attacks, but they can't directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Faster Flying-types such as Ninjask or Dodrio can KO Simisage with X-Scissor or Brave Bird, respectively, but cannot switch into Focus Blast, Knock Off, or Gunk Shot. Vullaby can wall Simisage and KO it with Foul Play, but does not appreciate losing its Eviolite to Gunk Shot and can be lured by Nasty Plot variants.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Simisage is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, and this, combined with Simisage's frailty and its reliance on Life Orb for maximum damage output, means that priority attacks such as Mightyena's and Pawniard's Sucker Punch, Monferno's Mach Punch, and Purugly's Fake Out will cut into Simisage's longevity, but Simisage can survive resisted priority moves such as Basculin's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are faster than Simisage, such as Floatzel and Sap Sipper Zebstrika, can scare out Simisage, as they carry super effective coverage moves, but they can't directly switch in. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F or Simipour can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Simisage and KO it with Blizzard or Ice Beam respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm hits Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Politoed, Golem, and Stunfisk hard, and it is boosted by STAB. Seed Bomb can be used instead to have a more easily spammable attack since it does not drop Simisage's Special Attack, but is far weaker. Knock Off allows Simisage to cripple Eviolite users such as Vullaby, Misdreavus, and Roselia. Superpower allows Simisage to handle Steel-types such as Pawniard and Probopass as well as hitting Normal-types such as Audino and Stoutland for super effective damage. Low Kick can also be used over Superpower, as you can still handle Pawniard and Probopass without Superpower's Attack and Defense drop. Gunk Shot allows Simisage to hit other Grass-types such as Tangela and Leafeon as well as Fairy-types such as Mr. Mime.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs allow Simisage to hit hard with its physical attacking arsenal. 252 Speed EVs along with a Naive nature boost Simisage's Speed, letting it outspeed positive-natured maximum Speed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Dodrio and Ninetales while Speed tying with Simipour, Simisear, and opposing Simisage. If you're running Seed Bomb, the remaining EVs should go into Special Defense, and a Jolly nature should be used to boost Speed without lowering Simisage's Special Defense. Life Orb works best with a mixed attacking Simisage, as it boosts the power of all of its attacks at the cost of some health. Overgrow boosts the power of Simisage's Grass-type STAB attacks in a pinch, which can come in handy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Simisage's low defenses, Simisage should be used sparingly due to the loss of health from Life Orb recoil, so be sure to switch Simisage in after a teammate has fainted or on a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Predicting switch-ins is crucial when it comes to using Simisage, as wasting turns by using resisted attacks cuts into its longevity due to the recoil that Life Orb gives. Thanks to Simisage's coverage, it serves as a good cleaner mid- and late-game, but it can be used early-game to break past defensive cores in the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem, Probopass, Roselia, and Venipede is essential to ensure that Simisage can wear down foes more efficiently. Examples include being able to 2HKO offensive Tangela with Gunk Shot after Stealth Rock damage. Simisage can be paired with wallbreakers such as Ursaring, Rapidash, and Simipour, as they can whittle down bulkier foes, making it easier for Simisage to function. Rapidash and Ursaring can also absorb Will-O-Wisp for Simisage, as Will-O-Wisp would otherwise cripple it. Because Simisage is frail, it appreciates a slow Volt Switch or U-Turn from Pokemon such as Probopass and Vullaby so Simisage can come in unscathed. Healing Wish support from Mr. Mime can revive a weakened Simisage, giving it another chance to sweep. Simisage is susceptible to all entry hazards, so entry hazard removers such as Armaldo, Vullaby, and Swanna make for good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seed Bomb is Simisage's main cleaning move and threatens opposing Water-types. Superpower hits Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard, while Knock Off cripples switch-ins like Vullaby and Tangela as well as threatening Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Misdreavus and Grumpig. Gunk Shot is Simisage's secondary cleaning move and its best option versus opposing Grass-types such as Roselia and Leafeon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Choice Scarf let Simisage outspeed most fast sweepers such as Rock Polish Regice and Shell Smash Gorebyss, as well as beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio, Mr. Mime, and Rotom-F. Maximum Attack investment helps it to more reliably revenge kill those threats, and Overgrow boosts the power of Seed Bomb if Simisage is weakened enough.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Simisage should be used to force out or KO setup sweepers and fast cleaners, although it can be an effective cleaner as well if the opposing team has been worn down enough. Using Knock Off more early-game can help to wear down opposing teams and remove Eviolites for an easier sweep later. Be careful about Choice-locking Simisage into Superpower, as it can become setup fodder once its Attack is lowered. Thanks to its mediocre bulk, it also won't be switching in on many strong attackers; although it can occasionally be brought in on a predicted Electric- or Water-type attack, it fears the super effective coverage that attackers of both types carry.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simisage generally fits best on offensive teams that need a fast, reliable revenge killer. Pokemon threatened by Water-types such as Rapidash and Stunfisk appreciate its revenge killing support. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Articuno also appreciate Simisage's ability to check common revenge killers and remove Eviolites from would-be counters such as Tangela and Clefairy. Simisage also pairs well with teammates that can wear down Vullaby, overwhelming it over a longer match. Fire-type checks such as Rapidash and Grumpig and Flying-type checks such as Probopass and Stunfisk give Simisage a teammate to fall back on when it is forced out by common attackers such as Simisear and Dodrio. Ice-type checks such as Grumpig and Metang are also useful, although Simisage is less pressured by them, as they do not resist Seed Bomb. Entry hazard setters such as Venipede and Golem help Simisage nab extra KOs by wearing down opposing teams and pressuring Vullaby more effectively.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is used for setting up and having the potential to sweep teams that are unprepared. Giga Drain allows Simisage to hit Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types such as Golem and Floatzel while also recovering health. Energy Ball can be used as a stronger STAB at the cost of losing recovery to combat Life Orb recoil. Focus Blast hits Normal-types such as Audino and Stoutland, Steel-types like Pawniard and Probopass, and is Simisage's best neutral move versus Fire-types. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit other Grass-types such as Roselia and Gourgeist, while also hitting Flying-types such as Vullaby. Hidden Power Rock is an alternative to Hidden Power Ice, as it allows Simisage to reliably hit Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales without relying on Focus Blast's shaky accuracy. Substitute can be used to protect Simisage from status as well as getting into Overgrow range or to set up on an opposing Water-type such as Politoed while they switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs make Simisage a threat that can easily decimate many Pokemon after a single Nasty Plot. With 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature, Simisage is extremely fast and able to outspeed a large portion of PU, including Ninetales and Dodrio. Life Orb is the preferred item to ensure that Simisage deals as much damage as possible, but it comes at the cost of some health. Overgrow boosts the power of Simisage's Grass-type STAB moves when it is low on health, which is manageable, especially with Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to get Simisage in safely, such as after a KO, from a slow pivot, or into something it forces out, such as Stunfisk or Relicanth. This is also the best time to use Nasty Plot, as Simisage is fairly frail and needs to have a free turn to set up. Make sure you have gotten rid of priority users and faster Pokemon while weakening the opponent's team to the point where Simisage can sweep. Keep in mind that Simisage is fragile and loses longevity, as it relies on Life Orb to function effectively, so set up only when it is safe to do so. Also, keep Simisage as healthy as possible because poison and paralysis can ruin its chances of sweeping. Simisage is used as a late-game sweeper, but it can be used early on to create holes in the opponent's team for its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simisage greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem, Venipede, and Relicanth, as they turn 2HKOs into OHKOs on Pokemon such as Ninetales and Regice after a boost. Simisage has trouble with Grass-types, so Fire- and Ice-types such as Ninetales and Rotom-F aid in taking care of them. Wallbreakers, such as Ursaring and Rapidash, can wear down the opposing team, allowing Simisage to sweep. Simisage also works well with Flying-types, such as Dodrio and Chatot, which enjoy the removal of Rock- and Steel-types. Meowstic and Solrock can provide dual screen support for Simisage, making it easier for Simisage to set up Nasty Plot. Support from Healing Wish Mr. Mime revives a weakened Simisage, allowing it to set up again and sweep. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Vullaby and Armaldo helps out Simisage, as it's vulnerable to all entry hazards.</p>"

It has decent coverage and a good mix of attacking stats, making it a viable special sweeper and wallbreaker, but Simisear faces competition from other Fire-types, such as Rapidash, and it's outclassed by Ninetales in many aspects, because Simisear is less bulky, but it is viable for the higher damage output it provides and the Fighting-type coverage. Unfortunately, Simisear is easily worn down due of its mediocre bulk and lack of recovery; it also has a bad defensive typing that makes it struggle against entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. Simisear can be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon, such as Zebstrika and Floatzel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Electric can be used for hitting Simisear's common checks, such as Pelipper and Swanna. Simisear with Taunt could be a great stall breaker. A SubSalac set, along with Blaze, can make Simisear a very fast and threatening sweeper against unprepared teams, and with this variant, Gluttony can also be used, as it makes Simisear eat the berry as fast as possible and therefore have slightly more HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong and Fast Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Floatzel, Choice Scarf Mr. Mime, and Zebstrika can outspeed Simisear, have a decent damage output, and can revenge kill it with ease, although they don't appreciate being hit by a STAB Fire Blast. Substitute can prevent this from happening if Simisear manages stay behind it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage by Toxic and especially entry hazards can wear down Simisear easily, limiting its setup and sweep opportunities and making it easier to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dedicated special walls such as Grumpig, Chinchou, Zweilous, and Audino can eat the majority of Simisear's special coverag and can cripple it with Thunder Wave or Encore. However, they must be careful of Knock Off or Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Because of its lack of recovery, mediocre bulk, and subpar typing, Simisear is easily KOed by many priority moves, such as Basculin's Aqua Jet and Mightyena's Sucker Punch, with minimal chip damage.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is Simisear's only setup move, and it gives Simisear an immediate +2 Special Attack boost. Fire Blast is very powerful and preferred over Flamethrower for the power. Focus Blast is for coverage to hit Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks, helping against Rock- and Ground-types, such as Probopass and Gabite respectively, which can be threatening. Grass Knot is another coverage move to hit Water- and Ground-types, such as Simipour and Golem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allows Simisear to be as fast and powerful as possible. A Timid nature is preferred over Modest; although it has less power, but outspeeding base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Dodrio and Ninetales, is very important. Life Orb boosts Simisear's power, especially with Blaze, and it can allow Simisear to threaten Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks with its STAB move, but Life Orb makes Simisear less durable because of the recoil, though it's still the best option. Blaze allows Simisear to fire off insanely powerful Fire Blasts before it faints, and behind a Substitute it is very threatening, although not very reliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Simisear is difficult to use because it rarely finds any space to set up a Nasty Plot, so it's preferred to set up late-game when its checks and counters are already weakened. Simisear can actually set up early-game and work as a wallbreaker, threatening Pokemon such as Audino in the case you already have another win condition. Be sure to remove all checks and counters, such as Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks or special walls including Rapidash and Grumpig. Simisear should be switched in on a predicted move or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Don't forget how frail Simisear is, so make sure to avoid any statuses, and be sure to remove entry hazards before bringing Simisear in. Because it is frail, Simisear should also only set up on switches or weak attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards support from Pokemon such as Roselia and Probopass is greatly appreciated by Simisear to help wear down its checks. Managing entry hazard control when running Simisear in a team is important, as it is weak to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, so Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Armaldo and Pelipper make for good partners. Sticky Web is a good option to slow down fast Pokemon such as Zebstrika or Kadabra and revenge killers, especially Choice Scarf users, such as Mr. Mime and Sawsbuck, that try to stop Simisear from sweeping, therefore Leavanny or Smeargle are good teammates. Grass-types, such as Leafeon, Tangela, and Roselia, can handle Water- and Ground-types such as Politoed for Simisear.</p>"

Grass Knot is for coverage, allowing Simisear to threaten Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks, such as Golem and Chinchou. Focus Blast allows Simisear to threaten many specially bulky Pokemon, including Audino and Zweilous. Taunt can be useful to limit the effectiveness of leads, such as Leavanny and Glalie, that rely on setting up entry hazards. Knock Off deals heavy damage to Grumpig and cripples Eviolite users such as Clefairy, whereas Rock Slide helps Simisear against Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is used to outspeed all base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Dodrio and Ninetales, and to have as much power as possible.

Life Orb is the best item option due to the power boost; when combined with Blaze, it allows Simisear to threaten Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks with Fire Blast However, it also makes Simisear less durable because of its recoil. Blaze allows Simisear to fire off insanely powerful Fire Blasts before it faints, and behind a Substitute it is very threatening, although it's not very reliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mixed Simisear particularly shines mid-game thanks to its ability to punch through the enemy team with its coverage moves, therefore opening holes for other team members.

Simisear is very frail and can be quickly worn down by Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, so avoid switching it into all but the weakest attacks. Simisear can't take priority attacks and doesn't do well when statused. Be sure to remove entry hazards before Simisear comes in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simisear appreciates being on offensively oriented teams in general because they have way more ways to make use of its ability to wallbreak. It also appreciates entry hazard removal because it has a glaring Stealth Rock weakness, so Defog and Rapid Spin users are good teammates.

Its nice Speed allows it to outspeed a lot of Pokemon in the PU metagame, and its awesome coverage, coupled with the ability to go mixed thanks to its unique moves, such as Low Kick and Knock Off, make it one of the most fearsome wallbreakers and a difficult Pokemon to switch into for balanced teams. Simipour is a decent Choice Scarf user, and it is the only Water-type in PU to have access to Nasty Plot, making it a decent user of the move. However, Simipour's pitiful bulk makes switching it in pretty difficult, and its susceptibility to any kind of residual damage makes it very prone to priority moves. Furthermore, Simipour's Speed, while not bad by any means, leaves it outsped by a lot of powerful threats, such as Zebstrika, Rapidash, Raichu, and Jumpluff, if it isn't using a Choice Scarf, making it overall less effective than it could be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf and Scald can be used instead of Hydro Pump, but Simipour then loses the ability to OHKO certain Pokemon, such as Frogadier. Simipour also possesses a fairly wide physical movepool, with moves such as Waterfall and Acrobatics, but the low base power of its physical moves makes it generally less effective than a special or mixed set. Finally, Substitute + Endeavor can be used to wear down common checks to Simipour such as Chinchou.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense, such as Grumpig, Audino, Clefairy, Muk, and Articuno, can take on Simipour and retaliate with a status move or wear it down. However, these Pokemon are susceptible what coverage move Simipour decides to run since Knock Off can heavily cripple the former three and Low Kick easily 2HKOs the latter. Taunt and Nasty Plot variants are also very scary since they can potentially get around all of these counters.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Specially Defensive Politoed and Chinchou can generally take hits from Simipour relatively comfortably and hit back hard. However, Chinchou must be wary of Knock Off from the wallbreaking set.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Simipour usually has low health after setting up, so priority such as Monferno's Mach Punch can revenge kill it if Simipour is not behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Fast Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Raichu, can outspeed Simipour even after a Salac Berry boost or if it is running a Choice Scarf and finish it off. Other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Leafeon can outspeed it before it gets the Salac Berry boost or if it is not using Choice Scarf.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Simipour's strongest STAB move, dealing heavy damage to any foe that doesn't resist it. Ice Beam provides good neutral coverage with Hydro Pump, as it hits Grass-types, such as Gourgeist and Leafeon, which resist Water. Hidden Power Grass provides perfect neutral coverage, hitting Water-types, such as Chinchou and Prinplup, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Electric is a viable alternative to OHKO Swanna instead. Superpower can 2HKO Audino and Regice, two of Simipour's best switch-ins. Knock Off is also a viable option in the last slot since it allows Simipour to defeat a strong check in Grumpig, as well as to cripple Clefairy, Roselia, Chinchou, and Bronzor by removing their Eviolite and making them unable to take Simipour's other moves comfortably anymore. Taunt and Nasty Plot are also possible options in the last slot to take advantage of status and Protect users respectively since some of its checks, such as Audino and Bronzor, rely on these moves to defeat Simipour.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Simipour's EVs are standard for a special attacker, but a Naive nature is used for a higher damage output for Superpower and Knock Off. Life Orb increases Simipour's power, allowing it to 2HKO Regice and OHKO Dodrio. Torrent is Simipour's only relevant ability, powering up Simipour's Water-type STAB move when Simipour is weakened. If chosen, Taunt and Nasty Plot should be accompanied by a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips:</h4> <p>Simipour should be used early- and mid-game as a wallbreaker to allow teammates to sweep more easily later in the game. Simipour has low bulk and no recovery, so it prefers to come after KOs or from a pivot such as Volt Switch Probopass. Simipour should usually go for the safe move, unless the opponent has a healthy Lickilicky; then, Low Kick should be used on a predicted switch. However, Simipour should be careful if the opponent switches between Pokemon that resist its moves, trying to Life Orb stall it. If Simipour runs Taunt and the opponent has common entry hazard leads such as Monferno and Whirlipede, Simipour can be used as a lead to prevent them from setting up entry hazards and 2HKO all of them; however, many other leads can OHKO or 2HKO it in response.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simipour fits best in offensively based teams which appreciate its ability to wear down of walls. Setup sweepers, such as Regice, particularly appreciate this; the latter especially appreciates Simipour weakening Chinchou and Bronzor. Other special attackers, such as Mr. Mime and Rotom-F, enjoy Simipour's ability to bait and KO Audino. Entry hazard setters, such as Golem, Cacturne, and Quilladin, wear the opposing team down; note that even one layer of Spikes allows Simipour to 2HKO Audino on the switch.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Simipour's strongest STAB move and is able to deal good damage to any offensive Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Ice Beam provides coverage, hitting Grass-types such as Leafeon that usually switch into Simipour, while also serving as a revenge killing tool against Flying- and Dragon-types. Hidden Power Electric allows Simipour to also hit Water-types such as Swanna and Pelipper, which would otherwise be able to wall this set. Superpower makes Simipour able to revenge kill threats such as Ursaring, Rotom-F, and Regice with some prior damage; it is preferred over Low Kick to not miss the KO on them, and it allows Simipour to threaten special walls such as Audino. Knock Off is used to cripple Simipour's common switch-ins such as Chinchou, taking away their items, and to hit Grumpig for good damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread along with a Naive nature is used to outspeed other Choice Scarf users, such as Dodrio and Leafeon, while still hitting as hard as possible. Choice Scarf further boosts Simipour's Speed, allowing it to take on most offensive Pokemon and revenge kill almost every setup sweeper. Torrent gives Simipour a significant boost in power to its STAB moves when it gets low on HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Simipour should act as a revenge killer, as its high Special Attack, Choice Scarf-boosted Speed, and good coverage moves allow it to revenge kill offensive Pokemon such as Leafeon, Jumpluff, and Monferno. Simipour should not be switched in on attacks because of its mediocre bulk; it should be brought in after a teammate gets KOed or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Simipour should not try to predict an opposing switch when it gets brought in to revenge kill a foe, as it could be too risky. Hydro Pump should be spammed when the opponent doesn't carry special walls, such as Audino, or Pokemon that are immune to Water-type coverage, such as Politoed. Try to preserve Simipour for the late-game, as it can serve as a good cleaner and is especially dangerous if the opponent carries a late-game sweeper such as Gorebyss that can be dealt with by Simipour.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Simipour works best on offensive teams that need backup for common setup sweepers such as Gorebyss. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland, Ursaring, and Monferno can take special walls that bother Simipour, such as Audino and Articuno, out of the way, allowing it to spam Hydro Pump freely, or just open holes into the opposing team, creating opportunities for a late-game cleanup. Entry hazard support is appreciated by Simipour to wear down foes and have better chances at revenge killing them, or to attempt a sweep. Toxic Spikes are especially good to wear down special walls such as Grumpig and Audino that might switch in on Simipour. Examples of entry hazards setters are Golem, Roselia, Venipede, and Cacturne. Zebstrika and Probopass can bring in Simipour on the field safely, preventing it from taking unnecessary damage thanks to their access to a slow Volt Switch. Pokemon that can check and KO Grass-types such as Roselia with ease are appreciated by Simipour. Examples are Fire-types such as Rapidash and Monferno, Flying-types such as Jumpluff, and Steel-types such as Mawile and Pawniard.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Simipour to dodge status while making it easier to get into Salac Berry and Torrent range. Nasty Plot raises its Special Attack and lets it sweep. Hydro Pump is Simipour's main STAB attack. It is boosted by Torrent and has the power to break through Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks, such as Floatzel. Ice Beam is a reliable coverage move that lets Simipour hit Pokemon which resist its STAB move, such as Tangela and Leafeon, for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is required in order to outspeed as much as possible. This is helped by Salac Berry, which allows Simipour to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after the boost. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to give it as much power as possible in order to break through walls, and Torrent increases the power of Hydro Pump even more. 4 HP EVs put Simipour into Salac Berry and Torrent range after three Substitutes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to get Simipour in safely, either after a KO, with help from a slow pivot, or by switching into something it forces out, such as Monferno. This allows it to take as little damage as possible and force a switch to get a free Substitute if Simipour needs a Speed boost, or a free Nasty Plot if it can sweep straight away. Once it has boosted, if the opponent has Pokemon that can outspeed Simipour or survive a hit, keep using Substitute until Simipour gets to Salac Berry and Torrent range. Salac Berry only works once, meaning Simipour only has one chance to sweep. As such, before you set up, make sure you have gotten rid of priority users and faster Pokemon and weakened the opponent's team to the point where Simipour can sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simipour greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia, as they turn 2HKOs into OHKOs on Pokemon such as Articuno and Pelipper. Simipour's coverage is resisted by Water-types, so Grass- and Electric-types, such as Zebstrika and Leafeon, are helpful in order to beat them. Strong wallbreakers, such as Ursaring and Stoutland, can wear down the opposing team, allowing Simipour to sweep. Simipour also works well with Bug-types, such as Ninjask, which enjoys the removal of Rock- and Fire-types.</p>"

  "Unfezant": {
    "overview": "<p>Unfezant is a very mediocre Pokemon because it is outclassed by Dodrio due to its lower Speed and lack of an effective Flying-type STAB move. Unfezant, however, has a niche over Dodrio with access to U-turn and a slightly higher Attack stat that, while not enough to warrant a purely offensive set, makes it a decent Tailwind setter with Hypnosis. Unfezant's access to Super Luck is also noteworthy, causing common and powerful critical hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wide Lens can be used over Scope Lens to increase the accuracy of Hypnosis. Unfezant can use an offensive Choice Band or Choice Scarf set, although it's almost completely outclassed by Dodrio. Unfezant can utilize Roost for reliable recovery, but it takes up an important moveslot. Unfezant can use the weak Aerial Ace as a STAB move; however, it doesn't do anywhere near the amount of damage Return does, except Ghost-types and Pokemon hit for super effective damage. Sky Attack is Unfezant's strongest Flying-type STAB move and a viable option with a Power Herb, although it can only be reliably used once. Unfezant can also take the role of a weather setter, utilizing Rain Dance or Sunny Day, then switching out to a rain sweeper via U-turn, although the job is done better by Volbeat, which has Prankster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Golem and Probopass take low amounts of damage from any move Unfezant wants to throw at them, and can fire back with a Rock-type STAB move, the former can also set up Stealth Rock with ease.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gourgeist-XL, Misdreavus, Dusknoir, and other Ghost-types are immune to Return and have the ability to burn or get damage off on Unfezant, which can't damage them back. Misdreavus with max Speed can also outpace and Taunt Unfezant if Unfezant is running an Adamant nature.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika, Raichu, and Rotom-F can outpace Unfezant before it uses Tailwind and deal massive damage to it, although they are unable to switch into it, because Return KOes them. Electabuzz has the ability to switch into a Hypnosis, as it is immune to sleep-inducing moves thanks to Vital Spirit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Klang, Probopass, and Mawile can take any hit from Unfezant and set up, Klang using Shift Gear, and the latter setting Stealth Rock.</p>",

      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tailwind doubles Unfezant's and its teammates' Speed for a few turns, which can help your team outpace opposing Pokemon and assist your sweepers. Hypnosis is a very risky move, but if it hits, Unfezant is rewarded by putting the foe to sleep. Taunt can be used over Hypnosis to prevent a slower foe from using a status or setup move, or setting up an entry hazard. U-turn creates momentum by allowing Unfezant to switch out to a teammate. Return gains a STAB boost from Unfezant and can deal a lot of damage to a foe that doesn't resist it, making it Unfezant's main attacking move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature allows Unfezant to be as fast and powerful as it can be. If Unfezant is running a Jolly nature, it can outpace Articuno and Mr. Mime as well as Taunt users such as Monferno and Misdreavus, although it loses out on power by doing so. Focus Sash can be essential to guarantee Unfezant will set up Tailwind if it is at full health. Scope Lens works together with Super Luck, increasing the chances of Unfezant getting a critical hit to 50%.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unfezant's main priority is setting up Tailwind, so that should be done first unless Unfezant still has its Focus Sash still intact, enabling Unfezant to be a lead for immediate Speed support. After using Hypnosis, U-turn is a good option, as most opponents will choose to switch out if the Pokemon they have in is asleep. U-turn is also a good option if the foe or resists or is immune to Return, or after setting up Tailwind. Return should be used to get the most damage off on a foe that doesn't resist it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch or U-turn users, such as Raichu, Zebstrika, Ninjask, and Jumpluff can form a VoltTurn core with Unfezant. Offensive Pokemon that would do better with a Speed boost, such as Simipour, Stoutland, and Mightyena appreciate Unfezant's Tailwind support. Setup sweepers such as Arbok, Clefairy, Pawniard, and Ninetales appreciate Unfezant putting foes to sleep. Dark-types such as Mightyena and Pawniard can take on Ghost-types for Unfezant. Fighting-types like Monferno can take on Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon for Unfezant with their STAB moves. Ground-types such as Gabite and Golem can take on Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types for Unfezant.</p>"

  "Zebstrika": {
    "overview": "<p>Zebstrika sports the second highest Speed stat of all relevant Pokemon in the PU metagame, which, along with its good coverage, makes it a great revenge killer and a threatening special attacker to a lot of offensive teams. It has access to two good abilities in Sap Sipper and Lightning Rod, granting it immunities to Grass- and Electric-type moves, respectively. Zebstrika is able to distinguish itself from other Electric-types such as Raichu and Rotom-F with its high Speed and its access to Sap Sipper and Overheat, allowing it to better take on Pokemon such as Tangela and Jumpluff. On the downside, Zebstrika is extremely frail, making it very easy to revenge kill. Zebstrika is relatively weak as well, sporting only a base 80 Special Attack, making it very easy to wall by common Pokemon such as Camerupt, Stunfisk, and Clefairy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because of its limited movepool, Zebstrika doesn't have very many other options. However, Zebstrika can run a physical attacking set, though its physical movepool is even more limited. Snatch can be used in order to steal certain moves such as Roselia's Synthesis to prevent it from recovering health. Me First can be used to allow Zebstrika to beat Stunfisk and Probopass, though it is very situational and unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Lickilicky and Clefairy can shake off any of Zebstrika's attacks and wear it down with Knock Off and Moonblast, respectively, while also staying at high health with their means of recovery. Other naturally bulky Pokemon such as Gogoat and Duosion can easily take Zebstrika's attacks and use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While Zebstrika always runs Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass, Ground-types such as Camerupt and Stunfisk can prevent it from gaining momentum with Volt Switch. If Zebstrika is running Hidden Power Grass, Vibrava takes very little from any of its moves and can therefore switch into Zebstrika easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that outspeed Zebstrika, such as Ninjask and Choice Scarf Mr. Mime, can take advantage of Zebstrika's lack of bulk and KO it if it is weakened before it can get a hit off.</p>",

Thunderbolt is stronger than Volt Switch, making it a great choice to allow Zebstrika to clean late-game. Overheat allows Zebstrika to hit Grass-types such as Roselia, Jumpluff, and Tangela at the cost of dropping its Special Attack by two stages. Hidden Power Ice allows Zebstrika to take on Ground- and Dragon-types such as Fraxure and Vibrava.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment along with a Timid nature and a Life Orb makes Zebstrika as fast and as powerful as possible. Magnet can be used in order to bluff Choice sets when Zebstrika is KOing a foe without having to take recoil from Life Orb; on the downside, it only boosts Zebstrika's Electric-type moves. Sap Sipper allows Zebstrika to take on common Grass-types such as Tangela and Jumpluff, while Lightning Rod grants Zebstrika an immunity to Electric-type moves while additionally granting it a Special Attack boost if it is targeted by one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zebstrika should mainly use Volt Switch in order to gain momentum against its checks while also dealing damage, although you must be wary of Ground-types, which are immune to it. Thunderbolt is preferred when the opponent doesn't have a good check to Zebstrika or if the opposing team is weakened enough for Zebstrika to clean up. If Zebstrika is running Sap Sipper, it should aim to switch into Grass-type moves such as Sleep Powder and Seed Bomb from Pokemon such as Jumpluff, and if it is running Lightning Rod, it should switch into Electric-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with access to U-turn such as Ninjask and Pelipper can form a VoltTurn core with Zebstrika to keep constant momentum against opponents. Pokemon with access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes such as Golem and Roselia allow Zebstrika to net certain KOs, such as the 2HKO on Ninetales after Stealth Rock. Wallbreakers such as Simipour and Stoutland can weaken or KO Zebstrika's checks and counters, allowing it to sweep late-game; additionally, Stoutland can take on a lot of Zebstrika's checks single-handedly. Bulkier setup sweepers such as Duosion can set up on the majority of Zebstrika's checks such as Stunfisk, Clefairy, and Vibrava. Pokemon that struggle with Grass-types, such as Relicanth, appreciate Zebstrika's ability to take them on, while Pokemon that struggle with Electric-types, such as Swanna, appreciate Zebstrika's immunity to their STAB moves. Simisage makes for a good partner for Zebstrika, as it appreciates Zebstrika's ability to take on Grass-types such as Jumpluff while Simisage can take on Ground-types such as Stunfisk, which Zebstrika struggles with.</p>"

  "Swoobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Simple, after a single use of Calm Mind, Swoobat's Special Attack reaches threatening levels. Also in Swoobat's favor is its access to Stored Power, a STAB attack that works well in conjunction with Calm Mind, becoming pretty powerful after just one use of the latter, and its Base Power can further increase should Swoobat acquire a boost from whichever Berry you choose to run. Even before a Salac Berry boost, Swoobat outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame. However, it needs a boost to inflict any significant damage, and Stored Power is pathetically weak off the bat. It also has limited setup opportunities because of its horrible bulk. Furthermore, it struggles against stall teams, as a mediocre Special Attack stat means that Swoobat requires multiple boosts to get past walls like Audino. Additionally, Swoobat is beaten by common threats such as Pawniard and sports a Stealth Rock weakness. To top it all off, it is vulnerable to priority and prone to being revenge killed if it isn't behind a Substitute, though a Kee Berry can somewhat mitigate this.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground can be used to deal with Pokemon such as Probopass. A Life Orb set with Calm Mind and three attacks is an option should you desire some extra coverage. Shadow Ball hits Metang for super effective damage and hits foes such as Beheeyem marginally harder than Signal Beam, but Swoobat can't really afford to forgo any of the listed main options to accommodate alternative coverage choices. Swoobat has access to a myriad of support options including Taunt, Magic Coat, dual screens, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Knock Off, Tailwind, and U-turn, but in spite of its great Speed, it is outclassed at using them by Pokemon such as Meowstic-M because of its horrendous bulk. Swoobat can try Klutz in combination with Trick holding a detrimental item, but Swoobat's poor bulk makes it risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Swoobat's poor defenses and weaknesses to common priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Quick Attack mean that priority attackers such as Pawniard and Dodrio can easily revenge kill it if it isn't behind a Substitute, though Swoobat can force mindgames with Pawniard.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: If Swoobat does not have a Substitute or a Salac Berry boost, it is prone to being revenge killed by faster foes, whether they are naturally faster, such as Zebstrika and Electrode, or attackers carrying a Choice Scarf such as Simipour and Rotom-F.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Probopass resists Stored Power, can take a Heat Wave, and can retaliate with Flash Cannon or set up Stealth Rock; it can also cripple Swoobat with Thunder Wave thus rendering it useless. Other specially defensive Pokemon can prove problematic for Swoobat; for example, Grumpig and Regice can both easily tank a +2 Stored Power, with the former being able to phaze Swoobat out with Whirlwind and the latter being able to hit Swoobat for super effective damage with its STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Courtesy of Simple, Calm Mind grants Swoobat great wallbreaking potential and augments its STAB move to 100 Base Power. Stored Power is the aforementioned STAB option; it takes advantage of the boosts that Swoobat accumulates. Signal Beam hits opposing Psychic- and Dark-types for super effective damage, although it does not do much to Pawniard. Substitute protects Swoobat from being revenge killed, and pushes its HP closer to Salac Berry range while offering Swoobat protection against status conditions. Roost is to be used in conjunction with a Kee Berry; a Defense boost enables Swoobat to actually take hits, so a recovery move is ideal to boost Swoobat's longevity. Roost can prove particularly useful against Electric-types to remove Swoobat's weakness to their STAB moves. Heat Wave is an option for the third moveslot, as it has excellent neutral coverage with Stored Power; notably, it hits the Steel-types that resist Stored Power, such as Klang and Metang, while OHKOing Pawniard after a little prior damage. Another option for the third moveslot is Air Slash, as it is a secondary STAB attack that has great neutral coverage with Stored Power, and its flinch chance can come in handy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread lets Swoobat do as much damage and outspeed as many foes as it can, while hitting an HP number that lets it get a Salac boost after three uses of Substitute. A Timid nature bolsters Swoobat's great Speed stat further. A Salac Berry provides a +2 boost to Swoobat when it hits 25% of its health or less, allowing it to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame and upping Stored Power's Base Power to 140. Alternatively, a Kee Berry can be chosen instead, as at +2 Defense, Swoobat has an easier time setting up and takes the multitude of priority attacks in the tier easier. Simple doubles Swoobat's stat changes and is the reason to use Swoobat in the first place.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swoobat should aim to set up Calm Mind as soon as possible on a Pokemon that can't do much to it, such as Tangela. Use Substitute if you predict a status move such as Thunder Wave or Toxic. If Swoobat is against a foe without a priority attack that it cannot KO, use Substitute until it gets to Salac Berry activation range to boost Stored Power to 140 Base Power. Swoobat shouldn't attempt to set up if the opponent has something capable of stopping it, as it can only really set up once throughout the battle. Swoobat should only attempt to activate its Salac Berry when it is going to need the Speed boost, as a lot of the time Swoobat would prefer to be at high health. Swoobat should never switch in on anything if it is holding a Salac Berry; instead, it should be sent out to revenge kill or force a foe out and set up. However, should you opt for Kee Berry, bringing Swoobat in on a weak or resisted physical attack is an ideal method of reliably acquiring the boost. Bear in mind that even when Swoobat gains a boost to its Defense, it is still prone to being taken out by powerful physical attacks, so Swoobat should be careful when attempting to set up against a physical attacker. Roost should be used if Swoobat has been worn down and it finds an opportunity, such as when it forces a foe out and it has already netted a Calm Mind boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>For a frail setup sweeper like Swoobat, dual screens support from a teammate such as Meowstic-M or Solrock is ideal. Special wallbreakers such as Ninetales and Simipour can soften up special walls. Solrock can set up Stealth Rock in addition to the aforementioned dual screens support. Swoobat dislikes taking Stealth Rock damage on the switch, so Defog support from a Pokemon such as Swanna isn't a bad idea, though not a necessity. Alternatively, you can try using a Taunt user such as Misdreavus to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up.</p>"

What's more, its Normal typing is beneficial defensively, as it provides only one moderately common weakness. On the downside, however, Audino is very weak offensively and can easily be taken advantage of by setup sweepers and Taunt users. It's also very susceptible to entry hazards, which are able to mitigate the recovery from Regenerator, as well as status if not running Heal Bell. Despite these weaknesses, Audino is a staple on any defensive team, and its ability to support its teammates with large Wishes is unrivaled.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Audino can be a decent Trick Room setter thanks to its great bulk and access to Healing Wish. Healing Wish can also be run on Audino's standard set, although the loss of either Encore or Protect often prevents Healing Wish and Wish to be used in tandem. Audino's access to Calm Mind means it can run a specially offensive set, but this is outdone by other Calm Mind boosters like Clefairy and Duosion. Despite its low attacking stats, Audino can be used as a tank by making the most of its hard-hitting, STAB-boosted Double-Edge while using its phenomenal coverage options in Drain Punch and Surf to lure and KO Rock- and Steel-types like Golem and Probopass that would wall Audino otherwise. Audino can use Return over Double-Edge on its specially defensive set, but the drop in power is noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Audino is not carrying Heal Bell, it becomes vulnerable to status-inducing moves such as Scald from Water-types like Lumineon and Swanna, Toxic from defensive Pokemon such as Grumpig and Altaria, and Toxic Spikes set up by the likes of Roselia and Venipede.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: If Audino lacks Encore or Thunder Wave, it is liable to be set up on by sweepers like Gorebyss, Huntail, Relicanth, Fraxure, Raichu, and Monferno.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Despite its decent physical bulk, Audino stuggles to take hits from the likes of Choice Band Stoutland, Monferno, and Choice Band Dodrio.</p> <p><strong>Taunt, Encore, Trick, and Substitute</strong>: Taunt, Encore, and Trick or Switcheroo can shut Audino down quite easily by locking it into one move. Substitute users such as Rotom-F and Bouffalant can set up on Audino lacking Encore or Double-Edge.</p>",

      "Wish Passer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish lets Audino heal itself and support its team. Protect is a necessity alongside Wish to let Audino heal itself safely while also allowing it to scout for Choice item users and troublesome moves like Trick. Knock Off can be used to cripple Eviolite users such as Tangela and Clefairy and to annoy most other Pokemon by removing their items, whereas Double-Edge hits decently hard despite Audino's horrible Attack stat. However, relying on Double-Edge as an attacking move leaves Audino completely unable to damage opposing Ghost-types. Encore prevents Audino from being setup fodder for sweepers like Pawniard, Gorebyss, and Duosion. Thunder Wave is a great alternative on more offensively-oriented teams, as it can slow down opposing Pokemon, and Heal Bell is very useful on defensive ones for removing crippling status effects from Audino and its teammates. Finally, Toxic can also be used to help Audino beat opposing bulky Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A specially defensive EV spread and a Careful nature are used in order to wall a huge number of PU's special attackers. Leftovers adds to Audino's walling capabilities by providing it with some passive recovery. Regenerator gives Audino a way to heal itself by switching out and lets it pass Wishes to its teammates more effectively without worrying about its own HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Audino can be used at any point in a match, and its primary function should be to pivot into special attackers such as Floatzel, Zebstrika, and Rotom-F. If it is being used on a defensive team, be sure to keep Audino healthy in order to let it wall special attackers. On offensive teams, Audino should simply be used to heal and support its teammates, and thus, it is slightly more expendable on these team archetypes. If Audino is using Encore, prediction is needed for it to be useful, as Audino is slower than most Pokemon that would commonly set up on it. For example, if Audino is facing Gorebyss, it needs to use Encore on the first turn it is out in order to stop it from setting up on and beating Audino. Be wary of Pokemon with access to Trick or Switcheroo that are able to cripple Audino by locking it into one move, such as Floatzel and Rotom-F. If it is not carrying Heal Bell, Audino should be careful of status users, such as SubWisp Rotom-F and Roselia with Toxic Spikes. Avoid using Double-Edge when its recoil would put Audino at risk of being KOed by an incoming attack. If Audino's presence in the battle is no longer necessary, it can be sacrificed by using Wish one last time for one of its teammates. Finally, Audino should be switched out of powerful physical attackers, especially those with access to Fighting-type moves, like Monferno and Stoutland.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Audino works great on almost any kind of team, but it works especially well on defensive ones because it can heal its teammates while simultaneously keeping itself healthy. Offensive Pokemon appreciate Wish support as well, as it allows them to pivot into attacks without taking heavy damage in the process. Defensive Pokemon that lack recovery such as Stunfisk, Metang, Grumpig, specially defensive Golem, and Relicanth are all excellent partners for Audino. Defensive Tangela is an exceptional teammate that forms a Regenerator core with Audino, wherein Audino is able to pivot into special attackers for Tangela and Tangela is used to sponge physical attacks for Audino in return. Entry hazards are problematic for Audino, as they mitigate the HP regained via Regenerator, so Audino especially appreciates Defoggers such as Vullaby, Vibrava, Swanna, and Lumineon as partners. Prinplup in particular is a great teammate, as it is able to both set up Stealth Rock and remove opposing entry hazards with Defog, while Audino's Wish compensates for its lack of reliable recovery and makes the most of Prinplup's Eviolite-boosted bulk. Audino is susceptible to setup sweepers, so blanket checks like Focus Sash Kadabra or fast revenge killers like Choice Scarf Simipour and Choice Band Ninjask are useful teammates. Finally, slow wallbreakers that enjoy paralysis support, such as Stoutland, benefit from Audino's Thunder Wave support.</p>"

Leavanny's access to Knock Off also allows it to cripple Pokemon such as Vullaby. However, Leavanny has only a few niches and can only perform the role of a Sticky Web user. Leavanny's average defenses and poor defensive typing also limit its time on the battlefield.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leaf Blade could be used over Leaf Storm to capitalize on Leavanny's solid Attack stat, but Leaf Storm does more damage to common leads. The combination of Swarm and X-Scissor could be used, but Leavanny lacks the moveslot for X-Scissor and Chlorophyll is better for a decent chance against sun teams. Swords Dance could be used for Leavanny to sweep, but Leavanny finds it hard to sweep because of its poor defensive typing, and Sawsbuck and Leafeon are better choices for an offensive Grass-type. Toxic could be used to cripple walls such as Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, but Leavanny lacks the moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Ninjask are immune to Sticky Web, take negligible damage from Leaf Storm, and KO Leavanny with their Flying-type STAB moves; however, they dislike getting hit with Electroweb, as it lowers their Speed. Dodrio also has the ability to Taunt Leavanny, preventing it from setting up Sticky Web, but it must watch out for Magic Coat.</p> <p><strong>Strong Faster Attackers</strong>: Because of Leavanny's mediocre bulk, strong attackers such as Stoutland and Simisear are able to deal with it easily and 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Entry hazard removers are able to remove Leavanny's Sticky Web after it faints. Both take little damage from Leavanny's attacks and can remove Sticky Web with Defog; however, they both dislike Knock Off. Armaldo can OHKO or 2HKO Leavanny with Rock Blast, and it can remove Sticky Web with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Klang and Regice don't take much damage from Leavanny's attacks and can set up Shift Gear and Rock Polish, respectively.

Knock Off hits bulky Eviolite users such as Tangela and Misdreavus, which makes them easier to deal with. Electroweb hits Flying-types, which are immune to Sticky Web, particularly Pelipper and Swanna; provides additional speed control; and cripples faster Pokemon such as Simipour. Magic Coat bounces back entry hazards from Pokemon such as Venipede and Taunt from Pokemon such as Floatzel and Simipour; however, it is quite risky to use on other entry hazard setters such as Roselia.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread and a Naive nature allow Leavanny to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible while maintaining an offensive presence. Chlorophyll gives Leavanny a better matchup against sun teams, making it easier for it to set up Sticky Web. Focus Sash allows Leavanny to survive at least one hit, guaranteeing the setup of Sticky Web.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of the time, Leavanny should be used as a suicide lead to set up Sticky Web. However, if the opposing team has an entry hazard remover that Leavanny has trouble dealing with, such as Vullaby or Vibrava, Leavanny should be kept for later. If Leavanny is sent out as a suicide lead, setting up Sticky Web should be its main priority. Electroweb should be used to prevent setup sweepers such as Fraxure from freely boosting. Leavanny could also use Magic Coat to bounce back entry hazards such as Stealth Rock once it has finished setting up Sticky Web, but it is quite risky, as Golem has Rock Blast to take care of it and break through its Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Leavanny only fits on hyper offensive teams, because they are able to deal with entry hazard removers much better than balanced and stall teams can. A spinblocker, such as Misdreavus, can prevent spinners from removing Leavanny's Sticky Web once it has fainted. Purugly is also able to pressure Defog users such as Vullaby and Pelipper thanks to Defiant. Fast Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu are able to deal with Flying-types such as Dodrio, which are immune to Sticky Web. Electabuzz also makes for a good partner thanks to its ability to pivot in on Flying-types. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Simipour appreciate Sticky Web support so that they can outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime. Stealth Rock from the likes of Probopass and Golem is useful to deal further chip damage; they can also take on Flying-types for Leavanny.</p>"

However, Venipede is one dimensional and predictable, as it can only perform the role of a suicide lead, and it relies on Endeavor to deal damage, which is not very reliable. In addition, Venipede also has a bad matchup against common leads such as Golem, which has Rock Blast to break its Focus Sash, and cannot do much against Defoggers such as Vibrava and Swanna and spinners like Cryogonal and Armaldo.</p>",

However, it has pretty bad base stats apart from Defense, making it unviable on defensively oriented teams. It also has to rely on its last moveslot to do damage, which will be taken up by Endeavor most of the time, which gives Whirlipede more utility than consistent damage, limiting its effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Whirlipede can run a more defensive set with Eviolite and Poison Jab if you want it to be a more durable entry hazard setter and have a reliable source of damage, even if it is weak. Whirlipede is also a decent user of Toxic, which can be used to pressure Ghost-types, Defoggers, or spinners with its boosted Speed, making it faster than some Taunt users and able to poison them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type leads such as Golem and Armaldo can easily KO Whirlipede right off the bat, especially if they carry Rock Blast, which makes its Focus Sash useless.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales, Simisear, Torkoal, Rapidash, and Heatmor don't really appreciate switching in on entry hazards but can still KO or set up on Whirlipede without any fear, breaking its Focus Sash with Will-O-Wisp or any weak move.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus doesn't take any damage from Spikes and can just switch in on Whirlipede as it pleases because it are also immune to Endeavor and take next to no damage from Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup Sweepers such as Leafeon and Simipour are a big threat to Whirlipede, as it can't really pressure them, having little to no damage output, especially if they carry Substitute, putting your whole team in a dangerous position.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Control</strong>: Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Pelipper and Armaldo, can mess up Whirlipede's entire strategy if it's not supported well.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority users such as Basculin can limit Whirlipede's utility as they will let it place a maximum of one layer of Spikes before KOing it, not even letting it set up another one or use Endeavor.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Simipour and Dodrio can take away almost all of Whirlipede's utility, being faster even if it's at +1 Speed and forcing it to switch, dealing a lot of damage to the rest of your team.</p>",

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes and Toxic Spikes are mandatory on Whirlipede and every Spikes-stacking team, as they serve to pressure the enemy team by putting some damage on foes every time they switch in. Protect lets Whirlipede get a Speed Boost safely and then proceed to quickly set up layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Endeavor is the best damaging move that Whirlipede can use, letting it bring an enemy to 1 HP if played well with Speed boost and Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and the Defense investment with a Jolly nature allows Whirlipede to set up Spikes as soon as possible and to stay alive as long as possible against physical attackers, especially against Rock Blast users. Speed Boost is one of the reasons why Whirlipede is used, as it makes it the fastest Spikes setter in the tier after it gets some boosts. Focus Sash lets Whirlipede take any hit without being OHKOed and set up more entry hazards or use Endeavor to take an enemy to 1 HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Whirlipede's potential as a suicide lead can only be fully used in the early stages of a game. Laying down layers of Spikes and taking one of the opponent's Pokemon down to 1 HP from the start is really easy thanks to Endeavor and Focus Sash, so try to use this tactic as much as you can when using Whirlipede, but take care against Pokemon with Rock Blast, Knock Off, or status moves, as well as Ghost-types, as they can nullify your strategy most of the time. Always look to the opponent's team when you decide what you want to set up on the field first; for example, if the opponent has a Poison-type, you will want to set up your Spikes before Toxic Spikes, so that they will not be removed. Be careful against setup sweepers, especially if they carry Substitute, as Whirlipede's weak against them, having next to zero offensive presence. Whirlipede also relies a lot on using Protect on the first turn to set up layers of Spikes when against decently fast Taunt users and popular Choice Scarf users such as Sawsbuck and Simipour, which outspeed it at +2 but not at +3. Because Whirlipede is pretty slow without boosts, Protect should also used when Whirlipede is at 1 HP to gain another Speed boost after setting up a layer of Spikes, which allows it to become faster than every Taunt user and also scout if the opponent switches into a Ghost-type predicting your Endeavor. When Whirlipede is at 1 HP, also consider placing another layer of Spikes, if you feel you really need it and the opponent doesn't have a reliable way to get rid of them, because they could also switch out to a Ghost-type, making Endeavor useless.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Whirlipede's strategy is supported well by a Stealth Rock setter such as Golem or Probopass to keep up the pressure on the opponent's team when against Pokemon with immunities to Ground and Poison. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly are appreciated when using Whirlipede to pressure or even KO the enemy's Defog user while gaining a +2 Attack boost, which is always appreciated. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir are also good teammates, as they can prevent your Spikes from being removed by the enemy spinner most of the time. Floatzel can be a good teammate because it effectively checks or even counters Rock- and Fire-types and can also make good use of Whirlipede's entry hazards to clean up the enemy team if using the Swift Swim set. Whirlipede appreciates Pokemon such as Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus or Rotom-F, which can stall out walls such as Lickilicky, Gourgeist-XL, and Tangela. Sweepers such as Regice enjoy Spikes support to weaken their counters.</p>"

On the downside, it's very frail, and along with its base 98 Speed, this leaves it easily revenge killed by offensive Pokemon; additionally, it is walled by some bulky Water-types such as defensive Relicanth and Politoed. It also faces competition from other common Water-types in the tier such as Floatzel, Swanna, and Simipour because of their superior Speed and coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with Superpower over Ice Beam can be used on Basculin for sheer damage, but it is unable to switch moves and is walled by bulky Grass-types. Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall that allows Basculin to 2HKO some possible switch-ins such as physically defensive Misdreavus. The downside of this is that it lacks Waterfall's chance to flinch and perfect accuracy. Taunt is a viable option that allows Basculin to prevent walls such as Gourgeist-XL from using status or recovery moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Lumineon and Politoed are able to easily take Basculin's main STAB moves and retaliate. The former can Defog on Basculin while the latter can simply KO Basculin with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical tanks such as Avalugg and Vullaby are able to take physical hits from Basculin and retaliate. The former can take advantage of Basculin by using Rapid Spin, and the latter can gain momentum with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status ailments such as burn and paralysis can easily cripple Basculin by limiting the damage it gets off with each hit or by slowing it down, rendering it almost useless.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zebstrika, Raichu, Electabuzz, and Rotom-F are able to outspeed Basculin and easily revenge kill it with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. If they use Volt Switch on a switch, you lose momentum.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Raichu, Simipour, and Jumpluff are able to outspeed Basculin and easily take it out because it is so frail, although if they are weakened enough Basculin can knock them out with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage such as Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and chip damage from weaker attacks and pivoting is able to quickly wear Basculin down, limiting the number of times it is able to attack.</p>",

Zen Headbutt allows Basculin to KO Roselia, which would otherwise completely wall it. Ice Beam allows Basculin to hit Grass- and Dragon-types such as Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Altaria. Aqua Jet, which is also boosted by Adaptability, is used to pick off threats such as Ninetales and Raichu once they have been weakened to a low amount of health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Basculin utilizes maximum Speed and Attack EVs, as it 2HKOes Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Tangela with uninvested Ice Beam regardless and bulk investment is unnecessary. A Naive nature is used over a Jolly nature so Ice Beam isn't weakened. Another viable option is a Naughty nature, giving Basculin much more power at the cost of some Speed, which prevents it from outspeeding Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Mr. Mime. The last of the EVs are placed into Special Attack to minimize passive damage. Life Orb gives a boost to all of Basculin's attacking moves, granting it the chance to OHKO Pokemon, such as Probopass, and letting it freely select different moves at the cost of recoil damage every turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Basculin in on a free switch against a Pokemon it outspeeds or a Pokemon with Aqua Jet. Use Basculin to punch holes against balanced and defensive teams alike or to finish off threats in the late-game. Don't leave Basculin in against faster Pokemon that can OHKO it, such as Ninjask and Raichu, unless they have been weakened to the point where they are KOed by Aqua Jet. Basculin is very frail and takes a lot of damage from the weakest of attacks, so don't leave it in against possible priority moves. Don't switch Basculin into strong attacks, as it will usually be 2HKOed even by resisted hits. Scout certain Water-weak Pokemon such as Ninetales, Stunfisk, and Probopass in case they are carrying Passho Berry to survive an attack and OHKO Basculin.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Basculin works well with strong wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Ninetales that can weaken bulkier Pokemon such as Politoed and Gabite for Basculin to clean up. Grass-types such as Tangela and Roselia work well with Basculin as they can check Water- and Grass-types for it while Basculin checks Fire-types. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Probopass and Vibrava are great partners for Basculin because they allow Basculin a free switch in. Entry hazard setters such as Roselia and Golem work well in conjunction with Basculin to help wear down its checks such as Politoed for Basculin to finish off.</p>"

Alongside Pursuit, Krokorok possesses powerful STAB moves in Knock Off and Earthquake, which can make it somewhat tough to safely switch into. Intimidate is a useful ability for Krokorok, enabling it to check threatening Pokemon such as Muk and Arbok. On the downside, poor 60 / 45 / 45 bulk means that Krokorok is incredibly frail and susceptible to common wallbreakers as well as lures. Its base 74 Speed stat is also below average for an offensive Pokemon. As far as Krokorok's STAB moves are concerned, Knock Off can be somewhat weak once the target's item has been removed, and Earthquake isn't as spammable due to the fact that it lets in Flying-types for free, meaning Krokorok is can be somewhat prediction-reliant in order to be effective. Lastly Krokorok's mediocre base 82 Attack stat means that it relies on its Choice Band for power, and must avoid Knock Off or Trick if it wants to remain effective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moxie may have a chance to be an effective ability on Krokorok, allowing it to sweep through defensive teams and gain attack boosts. However, the defensive utility that Intimidate provides is usually beneficial in a larger variety of situations. Thunder Fang can be run over Stone Edge to give Krokorok a way to KO Pelipper after Stealth Rock, while Iron Tail can be used to 2HKO physically defensive Clefairy and potentially OHKO specially defensive variants. A Choice Scarf set utilizing Moxie can be run, but it is very weak without multiple boosts and still is slower than most common Choice Scarf users. A suicide lead set with Taunt and Stealth Rock is also a possibility, but low Speed and lack of power once again make this a subpar set choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Simipour, Swanna, and Floatzel are all able to outspeed Krokorok and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Defensive Water-types such as Pelipper and Prinplup are usually able to stomach any hit that Krokorok can throw at them and proceed to knock it out with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although they cannot switch in directly due to the threat of Earthquake, Combusken and Monferno can outspeed Krokorok and OHKO it with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Keep in mind that Combusken requires one boost from Speed Boost before it is able to outspeed Krokorok.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangela, Quilladin, and even Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL are all able to easily wall Krokorok, which just isn't strong enough to break through them. Gourgeist-XL threatens to burn Krokorok with Will-O-Wisp, while Tangela and Quilladin can knock out Krokorok with their Grass-type STAB moves. Offensive Grass-types such as Simisage and Leafeon are able to outspeed Krokorok and OHKO it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Articuno, Cryogonal, and Rotom-F are able to outspeed Krokorok and knock it out with their Ice-type STAB moves, while Avalugg easily eats up any attack Krokorok can throw out and swiftly removes it with Avalanche.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Any strong wallbreaker from Choice Band Stoutland to Choice Specs Mr. Mime is easily able to break through Krokorok's paper-thin defenses and will easily OHKO it with its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Altaria, Avalugg, and Vullaby have the raw physical bulk to eat up hits from Krokorok, usually avoiding the 2HKO. However, they must be wary of switching directly into coverage moves such as Stone Edge. Vullaby also dislikes losing its Eviolite to Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Krokorok's most spammable move, removing Eviolite or Leftovers from defensive Pokemon as they switch in while also dealing good damage. Earthquake is Krokorok's strongest STAB attack and can be used to nail Steel- and Poison-types. Pursuit allows Krokorok to trap and remove Psychic-types as well as a number of other Pokemon such as Muk, Metang, and Camerupt that will try to switch out fearing a Choice Band-boosted Knock Off or Earthquake. Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types such as Pelipper, Altaria, and Vullaby.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>232 Speed EVs allow Krokorok to outspeed neutral base 70 and positive base 60 Speed foes, and 24 HP EVs let it avoid the OHKO from Adamant Golem's Earthquake after Stealth Rock. Maximum Attack EVs with a positive nature allow Krokorok to hit as hard as possible in combination with the Choice Band. Intimidate allows Krokorok to buffer itself against some weaker physical attacks while also potentially supporting teammates, as in some instances Krokorok can be sacrificed to get off a last-ditch Intimidate, enabling another Pokemon to come in and better take the hit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In the majority of matches Krokorok's main job will be to Pursuit trap something to support its teammates; you should make sure to scout for the likes of Beheeyem and Duosion in case they are carrying a coverage move like Signal Beam, although Bronzor should always be safe to switch into. Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that is somewhat spammable; Krokorok can use it to remove items from switch-ins such as Clefairy, Altaria, and Vullaby. Krokorok's bulk is such that it's only able to check a select group of Pokemon; just because it has Intimidate does not mean in any way should one try to use it as a physical wall. Keep Krokorok around to Pursuit trap Psychic-types and potentially deal with other things such as defensive Muk. Krokorok must also be highly wary of what move it chooses to lock itself into, Earthquake will let in Flying-types or Levitate users, while Choice-locked Pursuit has the potential to leave it setup fodder for Pokemon like Shell Smash Huntail.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Rotom-F, Jumpluff, and Articuno are very good teammates, as they reliably lure and pivot on bulky Psychic-types such as Bronzor and Duosion so that Krokorok can Pursuit trap them. Articuno is a particularly good partner in this regard, as it is walled by both Bronzor and Duosion and appreciates their removal. Similarly, offensive Pokemon such as Golem, Stoutland, and Arbok are also good teammates, appreciating the trapping and removal of Bronzor and Duosion, which enables them to better wallbreak. As far as defensive Pokemon are concerned, it's important to support Krokorok with a solid defensive backbone, as its frailty combined with relatively low Speed means that is forced out by a large number of offensive Pokemon. Chinchou is a good example of a solid defensive partner, checking Water- and Ice-types such as Floatzel and Rotom-F while also providing switch initiative through Volt Switch. Muk is another good partner, dealing with threatening Pokemon such as Cacturne, Floatzel, and Combusken, while Krokorok traps the likes of Bronzor and Beheeyem.</p>"

  "Maractus": {
    "overview": "<p>Maractus is totally outclassed by other suicide leads due to its mediocre Speed and lack of Stealth Rock, Taunt, Toxic Spikes, or Speed Boost. In particular, Quilladin almost totally outperforms it as a Grass-type suicide lead, and Maractus is also outclassed by other leads such as Crustle and Venipede. However, despite being outclassed, it can still function as a passable lead thanks to its access to both Spikes and Sucker Punch. Maractus is normally limited to one layer of Spikes due to its poor Speed, as opposing teams can simply lead with something capable of 2HKOing it, but it has a good matchup against some leads, such as Golem, against which it can lay down multiple layers of Spikes. Maractus can also force teams to play carefully around its Endeavor and Sucker Punch combination, which can sometimes nab surprise KOs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Maractus can run physically, specially, and mixed offensive sets with a number of different items, from Choice Band to Miracle Seed, but they are all outperformed by other offensive Grass-types such as Tangela, Jumpluff, and Leafeon. Knock Off can be run to cripple opposing leads, but Maractus generally prefers setting up Spikes over attacking. Grass Whistle can be used to put foes to sleep and set more layers of Spikes, but it has poor accuracy and forces Maractus to give up Endeavor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Most faster Pokemon in the metagame are easily capable of 2HKOing Maractus, limiting it to either a single layer of Spikes or a single Endeavor before it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Dodrio prevent Maractus from setting up Spikes, or, if they are slower, limit it to a single layer of Spikes, in either case preventing it from setting enough layers to effectively wear down opposing teams.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Pokemon that can remove entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin such as Pelipper and Armaldo can remove Maractus's Spikes once it has been KOed, permanently keeping spikes off of the field.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is what makes Maractus worth using as a lead, as it can lay entry hazards early on to wear down foes and break opposing Focus Sashes and Sturdy Pokemon. Because Bullet Seed is a multi-strike move, Maractus can KO Golem through Sturdy most of the time. Endeavor allows Maractus to cripple foes once it is hit down to its Focus Sash by always leaving them at 1 HP, while Sucker Punch allows it to land a little extra damage with priority and can get KOs on foes weakened by Endeavor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature make Maractus as fast as possible so that it can outspeed other leads, such as Dwebble, and set extra layers of Spikes on as many foes as possible. Maximum Attack investment lets Maractus KO lead Golem most of the time and deal extra damage with Sucker Punch. Water Absorb gives Maractus an immunity to Water and has a usable effect, unlike Storm Drain, which boosts Maractus's unused Special Attack stat. Focus Sash guarantees that Maractus will lay at least one layer of Spikes or be able to use Endeavor versus faster foes such as Rapidash, which would otherwise OHKO Maractus before it set any entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Maractus should always be used to set Spikes as early as possible, as its lack of strong STAB moves and coverage makes it fairly worthless late-game. Laying Spikes should be the priority over attacking foes, as Maractus doesn't hit too hard and should be used in more of a supportive role. Endeavor should be used when Maractus is at low health and is faster than its foe to do as much damage as possible. However, Maractus should use Sucker Punch versus faster foes to get off a little extra chip damage before being KOed. Even at 1 HP versus slower foes, Maractus should still consider laying another layer of Spikes if it's more beneficial than crippling a single Pokemon. Maractus should be wary of going directly for Spikes against common Taunt users such as Grumpig or Misdreavus, as it can land free damage with Bullet Seed or switch to an appropriate counter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Maractus should be used on hyper offense teams that can keep up offensive pressure and take advantage of Spikes to quickly break through opposing teams. Spinblockers such as Dusknoir and Misdreavus keep Maractus's Spikes up by preventing Rapid Spin users such as Armaldo from removing them. Pokemon with Defiant such as Pawniard and Purugly discourage Defog users from removing Maractus's Spikes, as they can get an Attack boost from Defog. Strong wallbreakers, such as Stoutland, can use the chip damage dealt by Maractus's Spikes to break through their few counters. Setup sweepers and strong cleaners also appreciate the Spikes support to ensure extra KOs versus weakened teams. Stealth Rock users such as Golem and Crustle can stack entry hazards with Maractus to get extra chip damage and wear down teams more quickly. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Ninjask and Raichu, can use the entry hazards to break down defensive cores quickly by forcing counters to switch into both Spikes and an attack and then switch out again. Phazers such as Whirlwind Grumpig can use Maractus's Spikes to help rack up residual damage on foes.</p>"

  "Gothitelle": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to not being able to use Shadow Tag, Gothitelle is seriously outclassed by its fellow PU Psychic-types. Despite having fairly solid Defense, its lack of any exceptional traits and poor Speed make it a fairly poor option for a team compared to Pokemon such as Grumpig, Kadabra, and Duosion, all of which bring far more to a team in the form of unique resistances, revenge killing, and a more effective Calm Mind user, respectively. All Gothitelle can hope to do is trap a foe weak enough to set up on, but this strategy falls to careful switching or simply facing a Dark-type. Although it can break through stall teams somewhat effectively and can be difficult to KO if allowed to set up, Gothitelle is pressured too much by offensive teams and fairly easy to chip away at.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other options</h3> <p>Gothitelle can run a number of offensive sets, including Choice Scarf, competitive attacker, and offensive Calm Mind sets, but all are simply outperformed by Mr. Mime, Kadabra, and Grumpig thanks to their higher base Speed and access to Focus Blast in the case of Grumpig and Mr. Mime. Gothitelle can attempt to use RestTalk rather than Mean Look, but without trapping it is easy for the opponent to switch out to an appropriate counter and beat Gothitelle one-on-one. Signal Beam is an option over Psychic to avoid being walled by Dark-types, but is somewhat weak even at +6. Gothitelle can also be used on Sticky Web teams with an offensive Taunt set to gain a Competitive boost from Defog users, but it is still very slow even with Sticky Web support and does not possess Grumpig's useful resistances or Mr. Mime's utility and unique coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Mightyena and Pawniard can stop a Gothitelle sweep due to their typing advantage and threaten to KO it. Vullaby fails to do much damage to Gothitelle but can stall it out of Psychic PP if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Dodrio, Ninjask, and Stoutland are serious problems for Gothitelle because they can KO it as it attempts to set up or once Gothitelle has KOed its trapped foe.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Grumpig and Floatzel prevent Gothitelle from being able to set up or recover health. Misdreavus can also boost against Gothitelle with Nasty Plot after preventing it from setting up with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Momentum</strong>: Most of the time, the opponent won't leave a passive Pokemon in against Gothitelle and will switch in a strong wallbreaker, making it hard for Gothitelle to trap and set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mean Look traps weak attackers such as Stunfisk for Gothitelle to set up on with Calm Mind, which allows it to accumulate Special Attack boosts to hit harder and Special Defense boosts to be harder to revenge kill. Rest keeps Gothitelle healthy to give it time to set up as much as possible, while Psychic allows it to deal decent damage with a STAB attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment minimizes the damage Gothitelle takes from physical attacks, making it somewhat hard to take down once set up. Leftovers provides extra passive recovery while boosting with Calm Mind, and Frisk allows Gothitelle to scout for opposing Pokemon's items, providing a little extra utility.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't bother setting up with Gothitelle if the opposing team still has a Dark-type, as Gothitelle won't be able to sweep. Only attempt to trap weaker attackers that Gothitelle will be able to safely use Rest against, such as Metang and Audino, and be sure to stay healthy with Rest so as not to be easily revenge killed. Gothitelle can also have some utility in checking physical attackers such as Floatzel or Monferno, and it can be preserved to deal with particularly dangerous foes. If you predict the opponent to switch to a Pokemon that cannot be used as setup fodder for Gothitelle once trapped, it can be advantageous to get off chip damage with Psychic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gothitelle does not need much team support, but teammates to remove Dark-type foes are essential to permit it to reliably sweep. Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type teammates such as Probopass, Regice, and Zebstrika can threaten Vullaby and Murkrow. Monferno is a noteworthy partner for being able to threaten Dark-types, particularly Pawniard, while Gothitelle can trap some of its checks, such as Altaria.</p>"

  "Duosion": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking at Duosion's stats, its sky-high Special Attack stands out the most. It is one of the best Calm Mind users in the tier, mainly because of its great ability Magic Guard, which makes it immune to entry hazard damage and, more importantly, status, so it is a great win condition for balanced and defensive teams. Its Speed, however, is incredibly low, so it needs Trick Room to outspeed anything. It's also quite frail, so it needs Eviolite to survive any hits. Its typing is also mediocre, with a huge weakness to Knock Off, and it faces some competition from Calm Mind Clefairy, which has similar bulk and access to Thunder Wave, although Duosion is much stronger.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regenerator is a good ability that recovers Duosion's health everytime it switches out, but Magic Guard is generally more useful. Energy Ball OHKOes Relicanth, which would otherwise be able to take a Psyshock or Psychic and hit back very hard. Thunder Wave can cripple some Pokemon that like switching into Duosion. Future Sight is a powerful attack that works well in combination with a physical attacker and can defeat Duosion's checks and counters by making them choose between taking a Future Sight or an attack from your checks to their Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard, Mightyena and Murkrow hit Duosion for super effective damage with their STAB attacks and are immune to Psychic. Pawniard can also trap Duosion with Pursuit. However, all three need to be wary of Signal Beam and Hidden Power Fighting, as they are not particularly bulky.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off hits Duosion super effectively and takes away its bulk by removing Eviolite. Notable users are Simisage, Simipour, and Dodrio.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt stops the Calm Mind set from setting up and the Trick Room set from using Trick Room. Notable users include Misdreavus and Grumpig.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types can check Duosion with their super effective STAB moves, cripple it with a Choice item by using Trick in the case of Dusknoir, or set up on it with Nasty Plot or Taunt it in the case of Misdreavus.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers such as Dodrio and Stoutland can 2HKO Duosion with Brave Bird and Return, respectively, even if Duosion has maximized HP and Defense EVs, although Duosion can become a nuisance if it sets up Acid Armors. Dodrio can also even cripple Duosion with Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Duosion's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it stronger and harder to take down at the same time. Recover provides Duosion with reliable recovery, making it able to set up on attacking Pokemon without being KOed. Psyshock is the STAB move of choice and hits special walls, most notably Audino, on their weaker defense. It also helps with winning Calm Mind wars with other Calm Mind users, such as Clefairy. Signal Beam hits the Dark- and Psychic-types that resist Psyshock, such as Mightyena and Grumpig, super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature allows Duosion to tank physical hits from the opponent's Pokemon, as Calm Mind boosts its Special Defense. Magic Guard is the preferred ability to ignore entry hazards and the status moves that would shut it down or severely annoy it otherwise. Eviolite is the only item that should be considered, because the added bulk is too great to ignore. 0 Attack IVs minimize the damage Duosion takes from Foul Play.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't let Duosion's Eviolite be Knocked Off or Tricked away, because without it Duosion lacks the bulk to set up. This set works best against defensively based teams, but it can be very successful against other playstyles after Knock Off users such as Simisage and Pokemon with super effective STAB moves are gone. If battling anything other than defensive teams, only set up late-game when Duosion's checks and counters are gone. Duosion can't set up against all physical attackers, unless it can manage to use Acid Armor before taking a big hit. Pokemon with super effective STAB moves like Mightyena and powerful Pokemon in general, such as Ursaring and Stoutland, can 2HKO Duosion. What Duosion can set up on are more passive Pokemon such as Clefairy and Pelipper as well as less powerful physical attackers such as Golem.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Monferno synergizes well with Duosion because it can take on Dark-types like Mightyena. Dark-type Pokemon such as Murkrow and Mightyena resist both Duosion's Dark and Ghost weaknesses and can remove the opponent's Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon, the former being able to use Pursuit. Roselia is a good teammate because it can lay down Toxic Spikes, which allow Duosion to wear down the opposing team while setting up. Duosion can also switch in and set up against some Pokemon, such as Choice-locked Beheeyem, that force out Roselia.</p>"

Trick Room turns Duosion's crippling Speed into an advantage and can do the same for slow teammates such as Marowak in case Duosion is forced to switch out. Psyshock is the mandatory STAB move and is preferred over Psychic to hit Audino harder. Psychic is definitely a viable move, however, because it hits most other Pokemon harder than Psyshock. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types and other Psychic-types, such as Misdreavus and Kadabra. Hidden Power Fighting covers Duosion's Dark-type weakness and hits Probopass very hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Special Attack investment is used to make the most of Duosion's huge Special Attack stat. Minimal Speed investment with a Quiet nature is used to outspeed as much as possible if Trick Room is up. Full HP investment and Eviolite are used to let Duosion take hits as it sets up Trick Room. Magic Guard is the preferred ability because it makes Duosion immune to residual damage, whether from Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, or status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Duosion can get free switchin opportunities versus Toxic users such as Clefairy. Keep an eye out for Knock Off, for without its Eviolite Duosion loses most of the bulk it has. This set works best late-game to clean up the opponent's team when it has been weakened. This set has a hard time switching into most Pokemon due to its only decent bulk, subpar typing, and terrible Knock Off weakness, but it can switch into more passive Pokemon such as Grumpig and Stunfisk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow but powerful Pokemon like Marowak and Ursaring appreciate the Trick Room Duosion sets up. At least one Pokemon to take Knock Off is needed, such as Muk. Pokemon that appreciate having Fighting- and Poison-type Pokemon removed, such as Mightyena and Clefairy, are good teammates as well.</p>"

A strong Water / Flying STAB combination allows it to hit the majority of the tier for good damage, and a nice Speed tier allows Swanna to outspeed Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Leafeon. While Swanna has only an average Special Attack stat, its powerful STAB Hurricane and Life Orb can help to remedy this. Unfortunately, Swanna has poor bulk, meaning it can find itself getting KOed early in a match. It's also weak to Stealth Rock, which it's meant to remove, meaning it can get worn down easily if it needs to Defog a lot during the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Air Slash is a nice move for when Swanna doesn't want to risk Hurricane's 70% accuracy, though it's quite weak. Surf can be used over Scald for its higher Base Power, but it doesn't achieve any notable KOs that Scald doesn't. Rain Dance is a decent option on rain teams to make Hurricane's accuracy 100% while also powering up Scald. Tailwind is an option to boost your teammates' Speed, but it's hard to find room for it on the set. Substitute can protect Swanna from status and other attacks, while Roost can heal up any damage taken from Substitute. However, this would mean that Swanna would have to give up Defog, which is the main reason to run it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Audino, Regice, and Muk have no trouble eating up Swanna's attacks and stalling it out with their recovery options. Regice can use Thunderbolt to hit Swanna 4x super effectively, while Audino can recover off any damage and wear Swanna down with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-F, Raichu, Zebstrika, and Electabuzz can either take a hit or outspeed Swanna and OHKO it with STAB Thunderbolt. They can also gain momentum against Swanna with Volt Switch. None of them like switching directly into a Life Orb-boosted STAB Scald, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Swanna's poor bulk, most faster offensive threats that can hit Swanna decently hard can deal with it relatively easily. These include Jumpluff, Rapidash, Purugly, Dodrio, and many more. Purugly can also switch into Defog and receive a +2 Attack boost due to Defiant. However, none of them like switching into Swanna's attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is Swanna's most powerful Flying-type STAB move, dealing with Pokemon such as Roselia, Gourgeist-XL, and Leafeon. Scald provides a Water-type STAB attack that complements Hurricane well, hitting Pokemon such as Golem, Probopass, and Pawniard, which resist Hurricane. It also has a nice 30% chance to burn the foe, punishing switch-ins. Defog helps distinguish Swanna from other offensive Pokemon, allowing it to clear entry hazards for its teammates. Roost keeps Swanna healthy, especially considering Swanna will usually be taking Life Orb recoil and switching into Stealth Rock. If Swanna is being used on a rain team, Rest can be used with Hydration to fully heal it. It is, however, reliant on rain to be effective.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature give Swanna as much power and Speed as possible. Life Orb is used to power up Swanna's moves and makes it much harder to switch into. Hydration helps Swanna deal with status when playing against or being used on a rain team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swanna should try to clear entry hazards for its teammates whenever possible, as Defog is one of the main reasons to use it. When Swanna is not clearing entry hazards, its main job will be to hit as hard as possible with its offensive moves. Try to use Roost often, or Swanna might find itself getting worn down too quickly. Lastly, if Swanna is out against a special wall and there are no entry hazards to remove, switching out or fishing for a Scald burn are usually the best options.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Swanna's role is to clear entry hazards for its team, Pokemon that dislike entry hazards appreciate Swanna's support; these include Rotom-F, Rapidash, and Ninetales. Swanna also is a powerful offensive Pokemon, making entry hazard support from the likes of Golem, Probopass, and Metang helpful. Do note, however, that Defog will also clear your own entry hazards, meaning that suicide leads such as Smeargle are not recommended. Swanna hates Electric-types, making Pokemon such as Golem and Stunfisk good partners to deal with them. Finally, if being used on a rain team, Rain Dance setters such as Volbeat can make Hurricane's accuracy 100% and power up Scald. Rain also allows Swanna to use Rest in combination with Hydration to fully heal itself.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Sawsbuck is a decent sweeper due to its two great abilities: Sap Sipper, which gives it an immunity to Grass-type attacks and boosts its Attack by one stage when it is hit by one, and Chlorophyll, which doubles Sawsbuck's Speed in the sun. Sawsbuck receives competition from Grass-types such as Leafeon; however, it has a niche in its Normal typing, which grants it the ability to hit opposing Grass-types such as Roselia hard with its STAB Normal-type move of choice. Its decent base 95 Speed allows it to be an effective Choice Scarf user. Sawsbuck has good offensive type coverage and it is quite difficult to wall after a Swords Dance. Unfortunately, Sawsbuck isn't too fast for a sweeper when out of the sun, its typing gives it 6 weaknesses to very common attacking types, and its poor defenses mean it's relatively easy to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wild Charge allows Sawsbuck to hit Pelipper harder than Double-Edge. Jump Kick can be used for hitting Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard. Megahorn can hit Tangela and Gourgeist hard. Substitute + Salac Berry can be used; Sawsbuck should continue using Substitute until the foe switches out or it gets the Speed boost. Aromatherapy can be used to keep Sawsbuck's team free of status, while Synthesis recovers HP and even more so in sun. Agility boosts Speed to ensure Sawsbuck isn't revenge killed by faster Pokemon when not in sun. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Pokemon before fainting.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon, such as Ninetales, Choice Scarf Rotom-F, Dodrio, Rapidash, and Simipour, can come in after a teammate faints, outspeed Sawsbuck outside of sun if it is not carrying a Choice Scarf, and OHKO Sawsbuck due to its poor defenses.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves such as Monferno's Mach Punch and Pawniard or Mightyena's Sucker Punch can hit Sawsbuck hard before it gets a chance to attack. Pokemon such as Volbeat and Meowstic can also cripple Sawsbuck with Prankster Thunder Wave, lowering its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon, such as Avalugg and Gourgeist-XL can easily sponge any hit Sawsbuck throws at them and retaliate with Avalanche and Will-O-Wisp or Foul Play, respectively. Sawsbuck needs multiple Swords Dance boosts and heavy entry hazards support in order to take them out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge, a strong STAB move with decent neutral coverage, allows Sawsbuck to hit a good portion of the tier very hard. After some prior damage, it is able to OHKO or 2HKO almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier that doesn't resist it. Horn Leech is a secondary STAB move that allows Sawsbuck to reliably revenge kill Pokemon such as Floatzel and hit other common resisters of Normal-type moves, such as Golem and Carbink, for super effective damage. It is also strong enough to 2HKO most offensive Pokemon on the switch and damage Ghost-types that try to come in, such as Misdreavus, and it has nice synergy with Double-Edge, which is able to hit Grass-, Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-type Pokemon hard as they switch in. Jump Kick is used to threaten Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard much harder than any other move Sawsbuck can use. Toxic, while it might look strange on a Choice Scarf user, gives Sawsbuck value in the matchup against bulkier teams by crippling potential switch-ins such as Avalugg. However, it can be risky to lock Sawsbuck into the move at times.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature is the best spread to outspeed and revenge kill as many boosted threats as possible. Sap Sipper allows Sawsbuck to safely switch into opposing Grass-types like Leafeon. Chlorophyll can also be situationally useful against Sun sweepers, specifically opposing Chlorophyll non-Choice Scarf Sawsbuck.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a revenge killer against common threats, such as Ninetales, Rapidash, and Simipour. Double-Edge is a strong, spammable move and is generally hard for offensive teams to switch into. Horn Leech complements it well, and its threat is usually enough to scare Rock-types from coming in. Although Sawsbuck is fast and strong enough to revenge kill most frail setup sweepers, be aware that it won't be much help versus priority-using sweepers such as Swords Dance Monferno and Moxie Mightyena. Toxic is also to be used when predicting switches to Sawsbuck checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Sawsbuck set fits best in offensive and balanced teams looking for a momentum gainer and reliable revenge killer for Pokemon such as Floatzel. For example, Pelipper can handle most of the Pokemon that check Sawsbuck, such as Torkoal, and appreciates a revenge killer for Pokemon that can beat it with ease, such as Rotom-F. On more offensive teams, entry hazard users, such as Smeargle and Crustle, are also great partners, as Sawsbuck is great at forcing switches. Teammates that are able to keep entry hazards up, such as Misdreavus and Pawniard, fit in as well. Wallbreakers such as Life Orb Simipour are great partners for Sawsbuck, as they allow it to sweep later in the game by weakening walls.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Sawsbuck's Attack by two stages. Horn Leech is a strong STAB move that recovers 50% of the damage dealt. Double-Edge is a hard hitting Normal-type STAB move; Horn Leech's recovery makes up for Life Orb recoil. Jump Kick is a necessary coverage move to hit the likes of Pawniard and Probopass who otherwise take Sawsbuck moves with relative ease. Substitute can be run over Swords Dance as it protects Sawsbuck from getting afflicted by status, allows it to scout foes' moves, and keeps it from getting revenge killed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A standard offensive EV spread is used on Sawsbuck to ensure it can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible to take advantage of its good Speed tier. Life Orb is used for more power. Sap Sipper allows Sawsbuck to get an Attack boost of one stage when hit by a Grass-type move. Chlorophyll should be the ability of choice if Sawsbuck is being used in a sun team, in that case an Adamant nature is preferred since Sawsbuck doesn't miss outspeeding any notable threat with its ability activated and appreciates the extra power especially against Pokemon such as Roselia.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sawsbuck is best used as a mid- or late-game sweeper. Sawsbuck shouldn't be setting up to sweep until its checks and counters are weakened to the point where it can 2HKO or OHKO them. When switching into Grass-type attacks, be cautious, as it's predictable and can result in Sawsbuck fainting, such as if an opposing Roselia goes for Sludge Bomb rather than Giga Drain when you switch Sawsbuck in. Make sure to bring Sawsbuck in on Pokemon it can set up on, such as Pelipper, Relicanth, defensive Golem, and Stunfisk, although the latter has the chance of paralyzing Sawsbuck, crippling its sweeping abilities. Substitute prevents Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Vullaby and Pelipper from inflicting status, allows Sawsbuck to scout incoming attacks, and prevents revenge killers from dealing damage the first turn they come in. When using sun, it's crucial to bring in Sawsbuck right after setting it up, as it needs to take advantage of sun's few turns and set up a Swords Dance if needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Roselia are appreciated, as they weaken Pokemon throughout the battle so that Sawsbuck can OHKO or 2HKO them. Wallbreakers such as Scrappy Stoutland can weaken walls to the point of getting OHKOed by Sawsbuck's attacks. A Fire / Water / Grass core including Sawsbuck has great synergy, as the members resist each other's weaknesses; Pelipper, Sawsbuck and Ninetales work especially well as partners in this case. If using Chlorophyll, teammates such as Golem and Volbeat are appreciated because they can use Sunny Day. Volbeat deserves a special mention, as it has a slow U-turn that can give Sawsbuck a free switch in. Pokemon that benefit from sun, such as Ninetales and Rapidash, make good teammates, as they are similar to Chlorophyll Sawsbuck.</p>"

  "Emolga": {
    "overview": "<p>Emolga is a bad Pokemon in PU that is outclassed by other Electric-types, such as Zebstrika and Raichu, which are faster and more powerful. Emolga does have a nice support movepool that includes Roost, Encore, and Taunt and a great typing that gives it resistances to Electric-, Fighting-, and Grass-type moves from many common Pokemon, but its poor bulk prevents it from checking them. Motor Drive allows Emolga to switch into Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu, but it cannot do much to them besides locking them into a move with Encore, and Emolga loses to their coverage moves, such as Hidden Power Ice. In addition to this, Emolga has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which is detrimental because it needs to pivot out and stay healthy during the match. Emolga is also quite passive and vulnerable to strong attackers, such as Stoutland and Golem.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Air Slash is an option to hit Grass- and Fighting-types such as Tangela and Monferno, but Emolga lacks the moveslot for it and can still lose to the latter. Knock Off can be used to take items off bulky Pokemon such as Roselia, but Emolga does not have the space for it. Pursuit allows Emolga to trap Pokemon hoping to switch out on an Encore or Taunt, but it is better off switching out with U-turn so that it can gain a favorable matchup, and Emolga's Pursuit is quite weak. Tailwind can be used to allow slow wallbreakers such as Fraxure to outspeed their checks, but Taunt is better to prevent setup sweepers such as Fraxure from setting up. Toxic allows Emolga to hit bulky special walls such as Grumpig, but it lacks a moveslot for it. Volt Switch has more power than U-turn, but it leaves Emolga walled by Ground-types such as Golem. An offensive set might seem viable but is outclassed by the likes of Raichu and Zebstrika.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Although Emolga has reliable recovery in Roost, Stealth Rock damage makes it easier to KO because it needs to constantly pivot in and out with U-turn. Burns and poison also limit Emolga's time on the battlefield.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers, such as Rapidash, Kadabra, and Floatzel, outspeed Emolga and threaten it with their attacks, as it is not very bulky even with investment in HP.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon, such as Regice and Avalugg, threaten Emolga with their Ice-type STAB moves and take little damage from Emolga's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Golem and Probopass threaten Emolga with their STAB moves and don't take much damage from U-turn or Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Although Emolga is immune to their STAB attacks, it cannot do much to Electric-type Pokemon. Raichu can take care of it with Hidden Power Ice, while Rotom-F has a powerful Blizzard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt allows Emolga to stop sweepers such as Fraxure, Regice, and Raichu from setting up and prevents foes from using status moves such as Taunt and Toxic. U-turn lets Emolga pivot out in an unfavorable situation, while Roost allows Emolga to stay healthy during the match and perform as a reliable pivot. Encore can lock the foe into an Electric-type or setup move, giving one of Emolga's teammates a free turn to switch in. Thunderbolt is a strong alternative to Encore that allows Emolga to hit Water- and Flying-types such as Politoed and Dodrio, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread and a Jolly nature allow Emolga to outspeed as many foes as possible and take minimal damage from Stealth Rock. However, if Emolga is running Thunderbolt, a Timid nature should be used. Motor Drive allows it to gain a Speed boost upon switching into an Electric-type move. Leftovers provides passive recovery, keeping Emolga healthy as a pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Emolga should not be switching into strong attacks because it is quite frail, so it should only be sent into attacks it resists or is immune to, such as a predicted Grass-, Electric-, or Ground-type attack from Pokemon such as Tangela, Raichu, and Stunfisk. Emolga should use Taunt on Pokemon that rely on their status moves, such as Roselia and Tangela, and on setup sweepers, such as Beheeyem, Fraxure, and Leafeon. Alternatively, Emolga can switch into a setup sweeper such as Ninetales, cripple it with Encore, and take advantage of the opponent's likely switch by using U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defoggers such as Vibrava and Pelipper keep Stealth Rock off the field, which is beneficial because Emolga will be switching in and out frequently and takes a lot of damage from Stealth Rock. Additionally, they can provide momentum with U-turn. Water-types such as Golduck and Simipour appreciate Emolga's ability to take Electric-type attacks, and they are able to take on Rock-type Pokemon such as Golem. Grass- and Fighting-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Monferno, respectively, are able to beat the likes of Golem. Ground-types such as Camerupt and Golem are able to handle Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu and Rock-type Pokemon such as Probopass. Fire-types such as Rapidash and Simisear are able to take on Ice-types such as Regice and Rotom-F for Emolga, but note that using them stacks a weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Klang": {
    "overview": "<p>Klang is one of the few viable Steel-types in the tier with its role being a late-game RestTalk Shift Gear sweeper. Its Steel typing is a defensive boon, letting it resist common threats such as Tangela and Roselia. Its good bulk with Eviolite and Steel-typing allow it to easily set up, however it is easily worn down so relies on Rest to heal itself. Unfortunately, Klang has a really poor movepool, so it's walled easily by type-advantaged opponents such as Monferno and Stunfisk. Klang relies on a lot of support from teammates and is weak before using Shift Gear.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Shift Gear sets with Wild Charge and Return can be run to catch foes off guard, but they are simply too weak to be effective most of the time. Choice Band is also a niche option that allows Klang to hit hard and pivot with Volt Switch but sacrifices recovery and bulk. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple offensive Pokemon that aren't expecting it. Volt Switch hits Pelipper hard and confers offensive momentum for teams not willing to waste time setting up with Shift Gear. Substitute can prevent Klang from getting inflicted with status or revenge killed but wears it down without any recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such Monferno, Ninetales and Rapidash can check Klang, threatening Klang and forcing it out with their super effective STAB attacks before it gets the chance to set up. Ninetales and Monferno can both come in as Klang tries to set up Shift Gear and use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Gabite and Stunfisk check Klang; they can survive a Gear Grind and retaliate with Earthquake or Earth Power. They can also set up Stealth Rock while Klang is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt users</strong>: Simipour, for example, can cripple Klang with Taunt, which stops Klang from setting up Shift Gear, using Rest to regain health or remove status, and using Sleep Talk if Klang is already asleep. This forces Klang to switch or spam a weak unboosted Gear Grind.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Knock Off users, such as Pawniard and Simipour, can remove Klang's Eviolite, reducing its bulk; this makes Klang unable to take as many hits while setting up with Shift Gear. Trick, while much rarer, both removes Klang's Eviolite and locks it into a single move, making it unable to boost with Shift Gear. Klang can be given a Choice item by Rotom-F or Floatzel.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Pokemon such as Ninetales and Ursaring can pressure Klang, meaning it won't survive long enough to set up Shift Gear and use Rest to heal back the damage. Ninetales and Ursaring can also set up Nasty Plot and Swords Dance as Klang switches out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear boosts Klang's Attack and Speed, potentially letting it sweep or clean up late-game. Gear Grind is a STAB move that hits twice, and while this is helpful against Substitute, Focus Sash and Sturdy users, it only has 85% accuracy. Rest replenishes HP and heals Klang of status, which helps Klang while setting up Shift Gear, and Sleep Talk lets Klang hit opposing Pokemon or further set up while asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Defense EVs and an Impish nature allow Klang to avoid getting 2HKOed by Quick Feet Ursaring's Close Combat. The EVs invested in Special Defense let Klang dodge the 2HKO from Life Orb Zebstrika's Overheat. Clear Body is Klang's only viable ability, as Minus and Plus are both useless in singles, and it stops Klang's stats being lowered. Eviolite increases Klang's bulk, so Eviolite Klang can take more hits while setting up with Shift Gear.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klang should be brought in against foes that can't touch it, such as Roselia, Tangela, and Gourgeist. It is essential that Pokemon that don't mind taking a Gear Grind, such as Stunfisk and Monferno, are removed before Klang starts setting up. Klang should start using Rest and Sleep Talk once it's low on health or has been inflicted with status; it shouldn't be spamming Gear Grind if it's burned. Klang should get at least one Shift Gear boost before having to use Rest so it outspeeds most Pokemon when using Sleep Talk the next turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klang appreciates bulky Fairy- and Flying-types, such as Clefairy and Altaria, as they resist Fighting. Grass-types such as Roselia can help take down bulky Water-types that resist Klang's Gear Grind, such as Politoed. Toxic Spikes can wear down foes' HP when they stay in to the point when Klang can clean up, so Roselia is a much appreciated teammate. Ground-types such as Golem and Stunfisk can deal with Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika. Klang pairs well with Misdreavus because of its immunity to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, two of Klang's three weaknesses. Pokemon that can take Fire-type attacks, such as Relicanth, Ninetales, and Rapidash, are helpful for covering Klang's last weakness.</p>"

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to Beheeyem's base 125 Special Attack and Analytic, often coupled with a Choice Specs, it hits extremely hard. Decent bulk makes it able to survive a hit and fire off strong Psychic-type attacks more than once per game, and it has a pretty good movepool with a lot of coverage options. However, Beheeyem has a bad typing with a nasty weakness to Knock Off, and its low Speed makes it easy for the plethora of faster Pokemon in the tier to revenge kill it if not inside Trick Room.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky set with Calm Mind, Recover, Psyshock, and Signal Beam could be used but is outclassed by Duosion, because Duosion has Magic Guard to protect it from status.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Krokorok are immune to Psychic and can force Beheeyem out with the threat of Knock Off or Crunch. Pawniard can also set up a Swords Dance as Beheeyem switches out or Pursuit trap it. In Trick Room, however, Beheeyem can easily defeat Pawniard with a Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir can threaten Beheeyem with their super effective STAB moves. Misdreavus can set up a Nasty Plot as Beheeyem switches out for fear of a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although Beheeyem has enough bulk to survive most neutral hits from full health, fast and strong Pokemon such as Dodrio, Pawniard, and Leafeon can KO it with little to no prior damage needed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Beheeyem's Special Attack to extremely high levels, which allows it to blast its way through defensively oriented teams. Psychic hits very hard and does a huge amount of damage against any Pokemon that does not resist it. Signal Beam hits the Dark- and Psychic-types that are immune to and resist Psychic, such as Cacturne and Grumpig, super effectively. Alternatively, Thunderbolt allows Beheeyem to hit Vullaby super effectively and gives it good coverage. Lastly, Recover keeps Beheeyem alive as it boosts and consistently takes damage from foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Analytic is the preferred ability for Beheeyem, as it provides an additional boost to its attacks, taking advantage of its low Speed. 248 HP EVs and 236 Defense EVs are used to buff Beheeyem's bulk as much as possible. Additionally, 24 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature allow Beheeyem to 2HKO physically defensive Clefairy after a Nasty Plot boost with Psychic and gives it a high chance to OHKO Vullaby with Thunderbolt. Lastly, Colbur Berry in conjunction with Nasty Plot ensures that Beheeyem is not ended prematurely against a Dark-type such as Pawniard or Krokorok, while Leftovers provides Beheeyem with passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As mentioned earlier, Beheeyem is used as a wallbreaker and can sweep in some games. This set works best against offense and balance, destroying a lot of teams by just spamming Psychic. Try not to let Beheeyem get afflicted by bad poison or burn, because status can potentially hinder its ability of sweeping or wallbreaking. Try to bring Beheeyem in on passive Pokemon such as Clefairy or on predicted Choicelocked- Psychics or Fighting-type attacks from Mr. Mime or Stoutland to setup. Beheeyem is also able to threaten out Pokemon such as Muk and Clefairy with Psychic, so this is another great time to set up Nasty Plot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like all Pokemon, Beheeyem appreciates Stealth Rock to increase the chance of KOing foes. Fighting-types such as Monferno and offensive Combusken can get rid of Dark-types that threaten Beheeyem. Additionally, Beheeyem breaks down slower, passive Pokemon, which benefits setup sweepers and cleaners such as Zebstrika, Simipour, and Rotom-F. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland and offensive Mawile can break through Beheeyem, so teammates like defensive Mawile and Tangela can be used to help handle them.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Beheeyem's strongest STAB move and hits incredibly hard coming off a base 125 Special Attack stat boosted by a Choice Specs and Analytic. Psyshock is an alternative STAB move that hits special walls such as Audino and Munchlax harder, but it is weaker against other targets due to its lower Base Power. Signal Beam hits opposing Psychic- and Dark-types such as Duosion and Grumpig, which resist or are immune to Beheeyem's STAB move. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard, which could otherwise freely switch into Beheeyem. Trick allows Beheeyem to cripple the opponent's special walls by locking them into a move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Beheeyem to outspeed an uninvested defensive Golem and other base 45's. It is advised to use a little more Speed, however, as Golem often run a little bit of Speed. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Beheeyem's damage output. The leftover EVs go into HP to make Beheeyem more capable of taking hits. Analytic boosts Beheeyem's damage even more and almost always activates because Beheeyem is very slow. Choice Specs makes Beheeyem incredibly powerful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Beheeyem is Choice-locked, this set requires a lot of prediction to work; if you predict wrong Beheeyem will be forced to switch out and take entry hazard damage each time it comes in again. This set works best early-game to break through special walls such as Audino and Grumpig or to weaken them for another teammate to break through later in the game. Tricking Beheeyem's Choice Specs onto special walls cripples them enormously, as it forces them to use only one move. Because Beheeyem is almost always going to move last, it does not like taking unnecessary damage by switching into attacks. Thus, you ideally send out Beheeyem after one of your Pokemon has fainted, by giving it free switches with U-turn or Volt Switch, or with double switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like all Pokemon, Beheeyem appreciates Stealth Rock to increase the chance of KOing Pokemon. Special sweepers such as Regice and Combusken appreciate Beheeyem weakening special walls so they can break through them late-game. Monferno can take care of the Dark-type Pokemon that threaten Beheeyem, although they have to watch out for Mightyena's Play Rough.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room uses Beheeyem's crippling Speed to its advantage to make it faster than nearly every Pokemon under Trick Room. Psychic is Beheeyem's strongest and preferred STAB move. Signal Beam gives Beheeyem more coverage against Dark- and Psychic-types such as Cacturne and opposing Beheeyem, which resist Beheeyem's STAB move. Thunderbolt allows Beheeyem to OHKO Vullaby and deal more to Pawniard whereas Shadow Ball OHKOes most Misdreavus variants after Stealth Rock damage and hits Metang hard. Hidden Power Ground is an option to hit Steel-types such as Probopass and Pawniard, which would otherwise be able to freely switch into Beheeyem, super effectively. However, it hits Metang for less damage than Shadow Ball does.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Beheeyem's bulk, and 252 Special Attack EVs maximize the damage Beheeyem can dish out. A Quiet nature is used over a Modest one to be even faster in Trick Room. Analytic is the preferred ability because although Beheeyem usually won't be outsped in Trick Room, it can still boost Beheeyem's damage output if Trick Room is not up yet. A Life Orb is the item of choice, as it allows Beheeyem to hit very hard while still being able to switch moves. Speed IVs are minimized to make Beheeyem even faster in Trick Room.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is meant to be a late-game sweeper that cleans up after the opponent's team has been weakened enough for Beheeyem to KO everything. Beheeyem should set up Trick Room against weaker Pokemon such as Zebstrika or Pokemon that cannot deal that much damage to it, such as Probopass. It can also set up Trick Room against defensive Pokemon such as Golem. Beheeyem should not switch into attacks, because if it does there is a good chance that it will not have enough health left to set up Trick Room. Even if it does, Beheeyem might not be able to sweep due to Life Orb recoil making it faint. If using this set on a dedicated Trick Room team, do not be afraid to sacrifice Beheeyem. Trick Room teams cannot afford to waste too many precious turns by switching, nor do they like losing momentum if the opponent predicts a switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other slow but strong Pokemon, such as Marowak and Rampardos, greatly appreciate Trick Room making them capable of outspeeding more Pokemon. Stealth Rock support is useful to grab some extra KOs against Pokemon such as Ninetales, and Stoutland. Good Stealth Rock users would be Golem, Marowak, and Rampardos. Wallbreakers such as Chatot, Nasty Plot Raichu, and mixed Simipour can weaken special walls for Beheeyem. Fighting-types like Monferno can defeat the Dark-types that threaten Beheeyem.</p>"

Fraxure's huge Attack stat coupled with a nearly unresisted STAB type in Dragon and an extremely powerful move in Outrage makes it rather threatening to take on defensively, and it even has the coverage moves necessary to eliminate the few Dragon-resistant and -immune Pokemon of PU. Additionally, its good set of resistances combined with Eviolite grants it many setup opportunities against offensive and defensive Pokemon alike. Mold Breaker allows Fraxure to bypass Sturdy and, in rare cases, Wonder Guard. However, Fraxure's low Speed tier for an offensive Pokemon leaves it susceptible to revenge killing, as every viable Choice Scarf user outspeeds it even after a Dragon Dance boost. Fraxure is also heavily reliant on Outrage to get KOs, but locking into the move can lead to an unfavorable situation against foes such as Pawniard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb and Lum Berry can be used instead of Eviolite, but the loss of bulk is extremely noticeable and not worth the extra power or one-time status immunity. For example, Pawniard's Sucker Punch does over 50% to Dragon Dance Fraxure without Eviolite, and Life Orb Raichu's Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Fraxure after Stealth Rock damage. Iron Tail can be used over Poison Jab to hit the niche Carbink, but it's uncommon enough to be not worth it. Iron Tail does not OHKO or 2HKO any variant of Clefairy or Mr. Mime that Poison Jab doesn't.</p> <p>Aqua Tail is an option to OHKO Golem from full health and hit Solrock for super effective damage, but other moves are generally more useful. Dragon Claw and Dual Chop provide an alternate STAB move for Swords Dance Fraxure, but the difference in power compared to Outrage is huge and not worth it, and Fraxure would prefer to hit Fairy-types. Choice Band is an option, but the Swords Dance set provides better wallbreaking potential in addition to better bulk with Eviolite, allowing Fraxure to perform better against offensive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: The most reliable way to check Fraxure is to outspeed and KO it. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Mr. Mime can easily OHKO Fraxure, while others such as Chatot and Sawsbuck need some prior damage in order to guarantee the KO. Timid Electrode and Ninjask both naturally outspeed Fraxure at +1, though they both need significant prior damage on it. Weather sweepers can also easily stop Fraxure, and Kadabra can survive a hit with its Focus Sash and paralyze or KO Fraxure in return.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus and Rapidash ends Fraxure's ability to do significant damage, while Toxic and Toxic Spikes limit its ability to maintain its sweep. Paralysis from foes like Kadabra, Murkrow, Meowstic, and Stunfisk heavily cripples Fraxure.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Though Swords Dance Fraxure can easily break through defensive walls, Dragon Dance Fraxure is stopped cold by bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby, Metang, Stunfisk, and Tangela. These Pokemon can cripple Fraxure with status, remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, or, in Vullaby's case, simply KO it with Foul Play.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance turns Fraxure into a fearsome sweeper by boosting its Attack and Speed. Outrage is Fraxure's most powerful move, and while it can be taken advantage of, it is usually quite spammable after Fraxure has acquired a boost. Low Kick takes care of Steel-types, most notably Pawniard and Probopass, and lets Fraxure hit Rock-types and most Normal-types hard without locking into Outrage. Alternatively, Superpower can be used for its more reliable damage output against certain targets like Klang, but the Attack and Defense drops can cause Fraxure's sweep to end early by putting it in KO range of a priority move or making it unable to KO a target.</p> <p>For the fourth moveslot, Taunt can be used in certain situations to prevent Misdreavus from crippling Fraxure with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave or to prevent foes such as Bulk Up Ursaring from setting up alongside it. Dual Chop can be used as a STAB move that doesn't lock Fraxure in, preventing opposing teams from taking advantage of a locked or confused Fraxure. Dragon Claw can be used for its accuracy, but Dual Chop OHKOes Kadabra through its Focus Sash. However, these options leave Fraxure completely unable to touch Clefairy and Mr. Mime. Poison Jab nails these Fairy-types and also lets Fraxure hit Grass-types, especially Tangela, hard without locking into Outrage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Fraxure's offensive capabilities, letting it hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is required in order to outspeed fast threats such as Zebstrika and Floatzel after a Dragon Dance boost. Eviolite gives Fraxure many additional setup opportunities due to the increase in bulk; it also allows Fraxure to survive priority moves from Pokemon such as Pawniard and Monferno more easily. Mold Breaker is Fraxure's only useful ability, letting it KO Probopass and Golem through Sturdy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Fraxure works best on bulky and hyper offense teams as a late-game cleaner. Physically bulky Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Metang should be eliminated before Fraxure attempts to set up. Fraxure can find setup opportunities on special attackers that can't hit it too hard, such as Roselia and Zebstrika. However, against offensive teams with Choice Scarf users or Ninjask, Fraxure will likely need two boosts in order to complete its sweep. If this is unlikely to be achieved, it should simply be used to throw out its powerful Outrage mid-game. Avoid locking Fraxure into Outrage until necessary, but be wary of Dual Chop's lack of power; for instance, Fraxure cannot OHKO Eviolite Monferno with a +1 Dual Chop even after Stealth Rock damage. Fraxure can fish for Poison with Poison Jab on certain foes such as Tangela early in the game to aid in beating them later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Fraxure needs bulky Pokemon removed before it sets up, physical wallbreakers that can KO the likes of Stunfisk and Vullaby support it well. Swords Dance Monferno and Swords Dance Pawniard can both weaken these walls; they can also check common Choice Scarf users with their priority if need be. Pawniard can also Pursuit trap many Choice Scarf users that threaten Fraxure, including Chatot, Rotom-F, and Mr. Mime, putting them into KO range of Stealth Rock. Other teammates that can to weaken physically defensive Pokemon include Choice Band Stoutland, Swords Dance Bouffalant, and Life Orb Simisage.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is required; offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Golem can ensure Stealth Rock support. Spikes support from offensive Roselia is great to wear down Steel-types, Stunfisk, and Tangela; Roselia can also remove Toxic Spikes that could prevent Fraxure from maintaining its sweep. Memento support from Jumpluff and Misdreavus as well as dual screens support from Meowstic-M can ease setup against stronger attackers. Sticky Web support from Smeargle enables Fraxure to outspeed grounded Choice Scarf users and Electrode after only one Dragon Dance boost, greatly reducing the number of Pokemon that can revenge kill it.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Swords Dance, Fraxure works as a bulky wallbreaker capable of at least 2HKOing the entire tier after a single boost. Outrage is Fraxure's most powerful move, with only a few resistances and immunities in the tier. Superpower hits Steel-types super effectively with the exception of Metang; as Fraxure's job is to do as much damage as possible, Superpower is used over Low Kick for its higher damage output against many foes such as Klang and Bouffalant. Poison Jab KOes Clefairy and Mr. Mime while also being very useful against Tangela, which is 2HKOed at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. Taunt can replace Poison Jab at the cost of becoming walled by Fairy-types; however, most status users that Fraxure would like to cripple with Taunt, such as Misdreavus and Meowstic-M, outspeed it anyway. Dragon Dance can also be used in the last moveslot to boost Fraxure's Speed, which could be useful in certain situations. It is unlikely that Fraxure will have the opportunity to set up both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>160 Speed EVs allow Fraxure to outspeed neutral-natured base 55 Speed Pokemon, such as Relicanth, and everything slower. Full Attack investment and an Adamant nature maximize Fraxure's damage output. The remaining EVs are put into HP to increase Fraxure's bulk marginally, giving it a better shot to survive certain hits, including Choice Specs Floatzel's Ice Beam. More investment can be placed into Speed; 200 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed neutral-natured base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Pawniard, or Fraxure's Speed can simply be maximized. Mold Breaker allows Fraxure to KO Golem and Probopass through Sturdy. Eviolite provides Fraxure with some much-needed bulk to survive hits from the likes of Zebstrika, Monferno, and Stoutland.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Fraxure works well on offensive teams as a way to KO or severely weaken physically bulky Pokemon that can be troubling for its teammates. Fraxure can be sent in early-game to set up and muscle through defensive Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Tangela. Against offensive teams, it is unlikely that Fraxure will have the opportunity to set up, so it should simply use its typing and bulk to check certain attackers and hit foes with its powerful Outrage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast physical attackers, such as Choice Scarf Dodrio and Speed Boost Ninjask, greatly enjoy Fraxure's ability to force in and power through their checks. Other teammates that can take advantage of Fraxure's support include Rock Polish Relicanth, Swords Dance Jumpluff, and various Choice Scarf users. Entry hazard support from offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Probopass is needed to ensure certain KOs, such as a 2HKO on defensive Tangela and a chance to OHKO maximum Defense Vullaby. Spikes Support from offensive Roselia makes it even easier to wear down Metang and Stunfisk.</p> <p>Sticky Web support from Leavanny helps Fraxure perform well against offensive teams, though Fraxure should run a Jolly nature on these teams in order to outspeed possible revenge killers such as Floatzel. Memento and dual screens support from the likes of Misdreavus, Jumpluff, and Meowstic-M works well with the types of teams that Fraxure fits on and can enable it to land more hits against offensive teams. Thunder Wave support from teammates such as Murkrow, Kadabra, and Misdreavus can allow Fraxure to outspeed many of the offensive Pokemon that can normally revenge kill it.</p>"

  "Stunfisk": {
    "overview": "<p>Stunfisk carves itself a notable niche in the PU metagame as one of the best status spreaders for balanced teams in the tier. With its reasonably good bulk, Stunfisk is able to paralyze opponents with its ability or Discharge, or poison them with Toxic. Stunfisk also has access to Stealth Rock, which provides good team support. Stunfisk makes for a good counter to common Electric-types in the tier because of its unique Ground / Electric typing, as well as a good check to physical attackers that may be reluctant to attack due to Static. However, Stunfisk's weaknesses to the ever-so common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks make it difficult to stay in for very long. Stunfisk also has a very, very low Speed stat, leaving it outsped by the entire tier bar Avalugg and Munchlax. It also has no reliable recovery and is very susceptible to residual damage and status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types aren't threatened by any of Stunfisk's attacks and can OHKO it or set up on it. Roselia in particular is a threat, as it has the bulk to take Earth Power, has Natural Cure to deal with status, and resists Stunfisk's coverage moves, while it sets up Spikes or OHKOes.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Faster Ground-types, such as Golem, usually will outspeed Stunfisk and hit it hard with a STAB move, although Stunfisk carrying Scald can take a hit and potentially burn. Pokemon that carry Earthquake as a coverage move also threaten Stunfisk.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, such as Simipour and Basculin, can hit Stunfisk hard with their STAB moves but must be wary of Passho Stunfisk, which will OHKO them in return.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and burn instantly puts a timer on Stunfisk's longevity and negates its Leftovers recovery, wearing it down quickly. Toxic in particular stacks up, making it even harder for Stunfisk to stay on the field.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt stops Stunfisk from using its utility moves, which really cripples it role as a status spreader. Stunfisk is also rather weak, which means any offensive move it is forced to use will not be doing too much damage.</p> <p><strong>Clerics</strong>: Clerics, such as Lickilicky and Grumpig, can eliminate the status Stunfisk spreads, and they can easily wall it and wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards, namely stacked Spikes, will wear down Stunfisk each time it switches in. Two layers of Toxic Spikes will badly poison Stunfisk, which makes it very hard for it to properly function as a wall.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Despite heavy defensive investment, Stunfisk struggles against offensive pressure, especially special attackers, as most invested attackers can still hit it hard and make it easier to wear down. Stunfisk only has Leftovers and Rest as recovery options, so it cannot stick around indefinitely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides the utility of wearing down each foe that switches in. Discharge is a STAB move that has a high chance to paralyze, allowing Stunfisk to cripple opposing Pokemon and sweepers. Earth Power is a good STAB move that provides coverage on opposing Electric-types, such as opposing Stunfisk. Toxic is a good move to cripple opposing walls that are not hit hard by Stunfisk's other attacks, and it has good synergy with Earth Power, as Earth Power threatens Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that attempt to switch into Toxic. Yawn is another option if Stunfisk wants to force switches or immobilize the opponent. Protect can also be run to scout foes and gain more Leftovers recovery, and Sludge Wave can hit Leafeon on the switch in and break Rotom-F's Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs add to Stunfisk's overall bulk, allowing it to sustain more hits and spread more status. 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximize Stunfisk's Defense stat, allowing it to take any physical hit well and possibly paralyze the opponent with Static. However, a specially defensive spread can be used to take hits from special attackers. The aforementioned Static is the ability, as it has a high chance to paralyze the opponent if hit on contact. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, although Passho Berry can also be run to check offensive Water-types such as Floatzel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stunfisk should stick around throughout the match as a pivot and spread status with Discharge and Toxic to cripple most of the opposing team. Stealth Rock is best used after Stunfisk has already induced status or if it forces a switch due to type advantage. With its good Defense and Static, Stunfisk does a great job of keeping physical attackers, such as Dodrio, Purugly, and Pawniard, in check. This means that Stunfisk can pivot into physical attacks to try to activate Static. U-turn, in particular, is a great attack to pivot into, as users of the move are normally reliant on being quick. That being said, Stunfisk should not pivot recklessly into attacks that are powerful, as they can easily wear it down. If running Passho Berry, Stunfisk should be used to lure in and KO Water-type attackers such as Simipour and Swanna. Not revealing its lack of Leftovers can help lure these threats in, as, once it is clear Stunfisk is not carrying Leftovers, they are more likely to be wary of Passho Berry.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stunfisk's paralysis support is greatly appreciated on balanced teams by Pokemon that are relatively slow albeit powerful, such as Bouffalant and Regice. These two Pokemon also can cover Grass-types for Stunfisk. Roselia and other hazard setters can set their hazards in combination with Stunfisk's Stealth Rock to apply extreme pressure to the opponent. Grass-types such as Roselia can keep Water- and Ground-type Pokemon at bay, making them good partners. Clerics such as Audino and Grumpig are good partners, as they rid Stunfisk of poison and burns, and Audino can provide Wish support as well. Spinblockers such as Gourgeist can also keep Stealth Rock on the field, as well as other hazards. If Defog is a threat, Pawniard is a good partner, as the evasion drop from Defog activates Defiant and boosts Pawniard's Attack by two stages. Swanna and Dodrio also have great synergy with Stunfisk, while Stunfisk can block Volt Switch for them, which they both despise.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs is a viable option on Stunfisk, as it finds a lot of opportunities to switch in and can do surprisingly good damage. Rest can be run in the last slot either with a Chesto Berry as the item or with cleric support, but it generally won't be worth the loss of Leftovers recovery or reliance on clerics. Foul Play seems like a good option to hit physical setup sweepers, but it is rather weak without a STAB boost, and Stunfisk would much rather use a status-inducing move. Scald has a chance to burn but is usually inferior to Discharge, as it has worse coverage, doesn't get a STAB boost, and doesn't always cause a burn, whereas Discharge is also backed up by Static. Thunderbolt is better on stall teams that would rather have Stunfisk poison foes with Toxic, as well as having a higher damage output.</p>"

  "Pawniard": {
    "overview": "<p>Pawniard is an incredibly threatening attacker thanks to its great Attack stat and STAB Knock Off and Sucker Punch in a metagame where Dark-resistant Pokemon are few and far between. It can also fulfill multiple roles as a Swords Dance sweeper, trapper, or Stealth Rock setter. Additionally, Pawniard has a solid defensive typing, resisting Normal, Grass, and Ice, allowing it to check many of PU's most threatening attackers. However, Pawniard has mediocre Speed and bulk, even with Eviolite, making it fairly reliant on Sucker Punch to deal with faster attackers. Pawniard is also susceptible to trapping by Probopass and it suffers from a few common checks and counters such as Stunfisk and Monferno, leaving every team with multiple ways to deal with it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick can OHKO Probopass, unlike Brick Break, but it misses out on the KO against opposing Pawniard. Magnet Rise allows Pawniard to beat Golem one-on-one more reliably, but it is fairly worthless otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Monferno</strong>: Monferno can take multiple hits from Pawniard while easily OHKOing it. It doesn't appreciates losing its Eviolite and can be worn down with repeated attacks, but it can also pivot out of Pawniard with U-turn and can reliably beat a +2 Pawniard by Mach Punching it first.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Gabite can reliably switch into Pawniard a few times and KO it with their Ground-type STAB moves, although they are ultimately worn down thanks to their lack of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn prevents Pawniard from doing any serious damage, while paralysis forces it to use the unreliable Sucker Punch to hit first. Status moves can also work around a predicted Sucker Punch, allowing foes such as Sleep Powder Jumpluff and Will-O-Wisp Rapidash to work around Pawniard's priority.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Pawniard's mediocre special bulk, most special attackers can either OHKO or 2HKO it fairly easily. Although they need to be at a high enough health to survive a Sucker Punch, Pokemon such as Floatzel, Raichu, and Gorebyss are all effective checks to Pawniard.</p>",

Iron Head hits Dark- and Fairy-types such as Vullaby and Clefairy. Swords Dance can be used to set up a sweep, while Pursuit can get chip damage on Pokemon that Pawniard forces out such as Dusknoir and Dodrio. Stealth Rock can be fit into the last slot on teams that lack a Stealth Rock setter. Brick Break can also be used to OHKO opposing Pawniard and 2HKO Probopass.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature let Pawniard sweep more easily, and maximum Speed investment helps Pawniard beat out as much as possible without resorting to Sucker Punch. Eviolite helps Pawniard check a number of Pokemon, such as Stoutland and Leafeon, when combined with its great natural resistances. Defiant helps Pawniard discourage Defog and gives Pawniard an automatic Attack boost versus Sticky Web teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Knock Off is Pawniard's best move to use in most scenarios, as it can cripple teams late-game and remove Eviolites from switch-ins. Pawniard can be brought in on predicted Defogs for the Defiant boost, but be careful, as Swanna and Vibrava can do significant damage to Pawniard with Scald and Earthquake, respectively. Pawniard can set up a Swords Dance early-game to weaken bulky foes such as Vullaby to ease late-game sweeps. If running Pursuit, try to not be too predictable, as most foes that Pawniard forces out, such as Dusknoir, can stay in predicting Pursuit, take the weaker attack, and cripple or KO Pawniard. You should also beware of getting Pawniard trapped by Probopass; avoid giving it a free switch in or being too predictable with switching Pawniard in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry-hazard stacking teammates such as Golem and Venipede can help to wear down Pawniard's switch-ins while Pawniard deters Defoggers from removing the entry hazards. Physical wallbreakers and cleaners such as Dodrio and Fraxure can be paired with Pawniard to break down each other's counters. Pokemon that benefit from Ghost- and Psychic-types being Pursuit trapped such as Bouffalant and Monferno also pair well with Pawniard. Fighting-type checks such as Grumpig and Clefairy are essential to take on Pawniard's biggest weakness. Clerics such as Audino can also help to keep Pawniard healthy. Floatzel is a notable offensive partner, as it threatens Ground- and Fire-types and absorbs Will-O-Wisp for Pawniard, while Pawniard checks Grass-types for Floatzel.</p>"

Bouffalant's access to Earthquake lets it hit many Normal-resistant Pokemon, such as Metang and Probopass, hard, and its great bulk allows it to check a variety of weaker attackers and Pursuit trap several threats. In addition, its access to Swords Dance enables it to break through most physical walls of the tier. Bouffalant's most useful ability, Sap Sipper, allows it to absorb Grass-type moves, particularly Sleep Powder, and Reckless is another option to give Head Charge insane power. Despite Bouffalant's bulk, its low Speed severely hinders it against offensive teams, and its lack of resistances and useful immunities apart from Grass means it has to rely on its raw bulk to take hits from most attackers. In addition, Bouffalant is stopped cold by the tier's most common Ghost-types, Misdreavus and Gourgeist-XL. Competition from other Normal-types makes it optimal on only certain teams; other Normal-types such as Stoutland and Dodrio are faster and don't struggle as much with Ghost-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower on non-Choice Band variants is an option to guarantee an OHKO on Pawniard, but it provides nothing outside of that, and the Attack and Defense drops make it an unattractive option. Wild Charge can be used to OHKO Pelipper. Sap Sipper on Choice Band variants can allow Bouffalant to gain more free opportunities to switch in, though it can easily bluff Sap Sipper while retaining the power of Reckless Head Charge. Stone Edge on the Swords Dance set can be used over Earthquake to hit Misdreavus, but Bouffalant can no longer touch Steel-types or Golem. Taunt and Toxic can wear down Pokemon such as Vullaby, but most defensive Pokemon are already beaten by Substitute + Swords Dance. Finally, a set of Return / Earthquake / Rest / Sleep Talk is an option to increase Bouffalant's longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: None of Bouffalant's attacks do significant damage to Ghost-types; in particular, Misdreavus completely walls Bouffalant and beats it with Will-O-Wisp or Foul Play. Dusknoir, Drifblim, and Gourgeist-S all easily take Bouffalant's attacks, though the latter needs Foul Play to beat Substitute variants.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Combusken and Monferno can outspeed and KO most variants of Bouffalant with their Fighting-type moves; however, both struggle to switch directly into Bouffalant.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Though it has good bulk, Bouffalant is susceptible to being KOed by powerful wallbreakers, especially physical attackers, such as Choice Band Dodrio.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Substitute + Swords Dance variants can break through many physical walls, but other variants of Bouffalant can be stopped by the likes of Vullaby and Solrock.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Though they must be wary of switching into Earthquake, Rock- and Steel-types can deter Bouffalant from spamming its STAB moves.

Misdreavus completely walls this set, so teammates such as Simisear, and Monferno are necessary to help break through it. Bouffalant also struggles with Vullaby and appreciates the support of Pokemon such as Mr. Mime to pressure it. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Relicanth, Gabite, and Golem is needed, and Bouffalant can check the Grass-types and some of the Water-types that threaten these Pokemon. Toxic Spikes from Roselia or Venipede put huge pressure on the switches that Bouffalant forces, particularly helping to put offensive teams on a timer and giving it an easier time breaking through Gourgeist-XL.

Head Charge can be used over Return as a more powerful STAB move, but the recoil damage is costly, especially if Bouffalant carries Assault Vest.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to maximize Bouffalant's Attack, granting it key KOs after Stealth Rock damage on targets such as Floatzel and Jumpluff. 252 HP EVs maximize Bouffalant's overall bulk, allowing it to take hits from these attackers more easily. 84 Speed EVs can be taken from HP to allow Bouffalant to outspeed uninvested base 65 Speed foes such as Roselia; 124 EVs can be transferred from HP to Speed to outspeed uninvested base 70 Pokemon, but this significantly decreases Bouffalant's bulk and gives opposing attackers an easier time beating it.</p> <p>Assault Vest increases Bouffalant's Special Defense significantly, allowing it to eat up hits from powerful special attackers such as Choice Specs Floatzel and +2 Gorebyss. Sap Sipper is the preferred ability to absorb threatening moves such as Sleep Powder from Jumpluff and Leaf Blade from Leafeon. Soundproof can be used as a surefire stop to Chatot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tank Bouffalant fits well on bulky offensive teams that need a pivot into special attackers such as Floatzel and Raichu. Bouffalant can easily switch into many frail attackers and trap them with Pursuit; breaking Kadabra's Focus Sash can be extremely helpful in allowing a teammate such as Gorebyss to sweep. It should spam Return against offensive teams when there's no need to trap a target. Bouffalant can easily pivot into most Grass-types with Sap Sipper and act as a sleep absorber.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Stealth Rock setters such as Stunfisk and Solrock pair well with Bouffalant, providing a physically defensive backbone that is particularly useful for checking Monferno, as well as providing entry hazard support. Teammates such as Monferno can switch into Misdreavus and Gourgeist-S, which Bouffalant cannot touch. Bouffalant needs support from wallbreakers such as Life Orb Simipour in order to break through sturdy physical walls such as Vullaby. Because Bouffalant is easily worn down against more offensive teams, faster teammates such as Electrode and Choice Scarf users can help alleviate this weakness. Entry hazard removal from teammates such as Vibrava and Swanna is appreciated for the same reason.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Charge is an enormously powerful STAB move that 2HKOes everything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake provides super effective coverage on most Rock- and Steel-types. Megahorn hits Solrock super effectively and is Bouffalant's strongest attack against Tangela and Gourgeist-XL, though Head Charge KOes other Psychic-types. Pursuit can be useful to trap some frailer threats and especially to break Kadabra's Focus Sash. Stone Edge is Bouffalant's strongest hit against Misdreavus, 2HKOing offensive variants. Return can be used, but it is noticeably weaker than Head Charge and Pokemon like Stoutland and Dodrio would better take on the role of a Normal-type wallbreaker; Bouffalant cannot 2HKO Vullaby or Stunfisk with Return.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Bouffalant's Attack and Speed, while Choice Band further boosts Bouffalant's power to terrifying levels. When used with Reckless, Bouffalant's Head Charge is capable of doing massive damage to any non-Ghost-type target. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Bouffalant's damage output; for example, with an Adamant nature, Bouffalant can OHKO Audino after one round of Stealth Rock damage. However, a Jolly nature can be used to guarantee outspeeding foes such as Adamant Pawniard and offensive Roselia.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bouffalant can use its enormous power early- to mid-game to break through common defensive Pokemon, clearing the way for a faster but weaker teammate to sweep. Bouffalant should be spamming its insanely powerful Head Charge most of the time, though it can use a coverage move to nail predicted switch-ins such as Golem, Solrock, and Probopass. It can switch in freely against many defensive Pokemon, especially Grass-types, as the threat of Sap Sipper can prevent them from using Grass-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Faster teammates such as Ninjask and setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Fraxure both appreciate Bouffalant's ability to force damage onto an opposing team's defensive core. Bouffalant works well on hyper offensive teams, so entry hazard support from leads such as Golem works well with it. Sticky Web support from Leavanny is useful, slowing down would-be revenge killers such as Stoutland. Teammates to switch into Ghost-types alleviate the pressure that they put on Bouffalant; Simisear and Monferno can switch into the common Will-O-Wisp freely, while Murkrow and Pawniard can trap them with Pursuit. Monferno and Combusken can also KO Rock- and Steel-types so that Bouffalant can spam Head Charge more freely.</p>"

  "Vullaby": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Vullaby's great defensive typing along with potent defense stats and reliable recovery in Roost, it is able to check common threats in PU such as Grumpig and Stoutland. It also has access to Defog, which isn't very common in PU, making it a great choice for teams without entry hazard removal; additionally, it has access to U-turn, making it a great defensive pivot. On the downside, Vullaby has a very poor matchup against the most common Stealth Rock setters, namely Stunfisk and Golem, and is weak to the entry hazard, meaning it takes 25% every time it switches in. Vullaby is also greatly crippled by Pokemon with Knock Off such as Pawniard and Audino, as it loses a great amount of bulk and its ability to check Pokemon such as Stoutland and Ursaring. On top of this, Vullaby is weak to very common offensive types such as Ice and Electric in the form of Pokemon such as Regice and Zebstrika.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Brave Bird allows Vullaby to take on Pokemon such as Roselia and Monferno, though it forces it to miss out on U-turn, which is important for gaining momentum. Taunt can be used to prevent foes such as Grumpig, Audino, and Bouffalant from using moves such as Toxic, Wish, and Substitute, respectively; however, it is very situational and outclassed by U-turn. Whirlwind can be used to phaze threatening setup sweepers such as Fraxure and Duosion, though Vullaby can usually check those foes thanks to its physical bulk and its access to Foul Play. Toxic can be used to wear down common switch-ins to Vullaby such as Stunfisk and Golem, though it is often less useful than the momentum that U-turn can offer. Tailwind can be very beneficial to Vullaby's teammates, as Vullaby can use Tailwind and then pivot out with U-turn, allowing a Pokemon to get a free turn with doubled Speed. A specially defensive EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD allows Vullaby to check Pokemon such as Kadabra and Roselia more effectively, though it loses its ability to check physical attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: While Vullaby is very bulky with the help of Eviolite, it has a lot of weaknesses, leaving it vulnerable to a large number of moves. For example, Ice-type STAB moves from Pokemon such as Regice as well as other Pokemon's coverage moves such as Floatzel's Ice Beam can deal a lot of damage to it. Electric-types such as Rotom-F and Zebstrika can heavily threaten Vullaby and can also pick up momentum with Volt Switch, while Fairy-type moves such as Mr. Mime's Dazzling Gleam as well as the less common Dazzling Gleam from Kadabra are able to KO Vullaby. Golem is also able to threaten Vullaby with Stone Edge or Rock Blast, preventing it from using Defog.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic and burn from Pokemon such as Prinplup and Gourgeist-XL put Vullaby on a timer, limiting its longevity and ability to check foes as well as remove entry hazards with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Because Vullaby is weak to Stealth Rock and often switches into it to remove it with Defog, it can be easily pressured after switching in multiple times. Pawniard in particular can heavily pressure Vullaby because it also discourages it from using Defog.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is important for taking on strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Arbok; additionally, it discourages Pokemon such as Fraxure and Bouffalant from setting up. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon such as Electabuzz and Clefairy as they switch in. U-turn allows Vullaby to pivot out of undesirable matchups against faster Pokemon such as Monferno and gain momentum. Roost allows Vullaby to recover HP and stay healthy throughout a battle. Defog lets Vullaby get rid of entry hazards from Pokemon such as Roselia and Gabite, making it easier to switch in and out throughout a battle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment along with 248 HP EVs and an Impish nature maximizes Vullaby's physical bulk with the help of Eviolite and minimizes Stealth Rock damage. Overcoat grants Vullaby an immunity to sand as well as moves such as Sleep Powder, making it a guaranteed counter to Pokemon such as Jumpluff.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vullaby can be switched into Pokemon it beats, such as Grumpig and Kadabra, and threaten them with Foul Play. It can also be used to pivot in and out of foes with U-turn, allowing a Pokemon with a more favorable matchup to come into play. Once Vullaby is in against a Pokemon it can take on, it can use Defog to get rid of opposing entry hazards. Vullaby can also be used as death fodder in order to get off a last-ditch Defog, clearing up the battlefield for its teammates. Be wary of lures such as Life Orb Dazzling Gleam Kadabra and Choice Band Bouffalant that can be used to 2HKO Vullaby.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Ninjask, Rotom-F, and Ninetales all appreciate Vullaby's ability to clear the field and prevent them from taking unnecessary damage. Vullaby pairs well with bulky Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Golem for their ability to take Rock- and Electric-type moves from Pokemon such as Relicanth and Zebstrika; additionally, they can prevent the foe from gaining momentum with Volt Switch. Audino is a good partner for Vullaby for its ability to check special attackers that threaten Vullaby such as Rotom-F, heal its status afflictions with Heal Bell, and restore its health with Wish. Vullaby also appreciates checks to Ice-type Pokemon such as Grumpig and Metang, as they can prevent Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Regice from taking advantage of it. Teams weak to physical attackers appreciate Vullaby's ability to take hits and KO the foe with Foul Play. Vullaby pairs well with Pokemon such as Monferno and Stunfisk that don't mind Knock Off, as then it doesn't have to lose its item.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Heatmor is a very mediocre choice in the PU metagame mainly due to its poor Speed, which means that Pokemon such as Simisear or Rapidash are usually better choices. However, Heatmor still has a few things going for it. Its fantastic coverage and good offensive stats make it very hard to switch into. It also has a useful ability, Flash Fire, allowing it to check other Fire-types, such as Ninetales, and a form of priority in Sucker Punch. However, Sucker Punch does not make up for its poor Speed, so it is outsped by common Pokemon such as Simipour and Zebstrika, and its poor bulk and three weaknesses also mean it is easy to revenge kill, making it struggle to put in work against offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heatmor already has good coverage in its moveset and thus doesn't require many other moves to help it. Expert Belt could be used as Heatmor gets easily worn down with Life Orb recoil and entry hazards, but the item doesn't always boost its moves. Substitute paired with Salac Berry can allow Heatmor to sweep late-game, but it still gets outsped by common Choice Scarf users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Heatmor's low Speed means it can be easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Floatzel and Simipour. Its low bulk means that Pokemon that hit it for neutral damage, such as Sawsbuck and Mr. Mime, can also KO it with little prior damage required.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Heatmor is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to Spikes, limiting the number of times it can switch in. Life Orb recoil also wears Heatmor down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Heatmor's most powerful STAB move, allowing Heatmor to break through or dent Pokemon that it hits neutrally. Giga Drain provides good coverage, hitting Rock- and Water-types such as Golem and Politoed, while Superpower 2HKOes Audino after Stealth Rock and also hits Ninetales hard. Sucker Punch can be used for priority, allowing Heatmor to revenge kill or weaken faster Pokemon, and although it hits off Heatmor's weaker Attack stat, it still has the power to 2HKO Pokemon such as Raichu. Knock Off can be used instead of Sucker Punch to hit Grumpig while removing Clefairy Eviolite and crippling any switch-in by removing its item, but you lack anything to hit faster Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Max Special Attack investment boosts Heatmor's power, increasing its wallbreaking potential, which is boosted even more by Life Orb and a Rash nature. 216 Speed EVs allow Heatmor to outspeed Adamant Pawniard. The remaining EVs go in Attack, boosting the power of Heatmor's physical moves. Flash Fire lets Heatmor check other Fire-types and can boost the power of Heatmor's own Fire-type STAB move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its low bulk, Heatmor dislikes switching into strong hits and thus prefers to be brought in after a KO or by a safe pivot. However, it can be brought in on Fire-types, such as Rapidash, in order to get a Flash Fire boost. Heatmor should be used early- or mid-game to weaken walls, allowing its teammates to sweep. Due to its strength and coverage, predictions are not necessarily required but can allow Heatmor to 2HKO a switch-in. Sucker Punch is not very reliable, so often it is better to use something else to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon, but it is helpful in allowing Heatmor to finish off a threat it has weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock and Spikes from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia wear down the opposing team and allow Heatmor to score KOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Stealth Rock allows Heatmor to OHKO Mr. Mime with Fire Blast. Rapid Spin and Defog from Pokemon such as Armaldo and Swanna are important as Heatmor is weak to Stealth Rock and will lose a quarter of its health upon switching in when the hazard is up. Water-types, such as Floatzel and Politoed, can switch into Water-type moves and threaten Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, and in return, Heatmor beats Grass-type Pokemon. Sticky Web partially makes up for Heatmor's poor Speed, but Heatmor needs to invest more into Speed to outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon, and without a Speed-boosting nature it will always be outsped by Floatzel and Raichu. Tangela resists Water and Ground and has enough bulk to stomach most Rock-type attacks, while beating Aqua Jet users Floatzel and Basculin. Setup sweepers, such as Regice and Fraxure, appreciate Heatmor's ability to wear down walls, giving them an easier time sweeping.</p>"

  "Zweilous": {
    "overview": "<p>Hustle is Zweilous's most significant trait, giving a massive power boost to its physical attacks. This is augmented by Zweilous's access to powerful STAB moves and decent neutral coverage, making it very tricky to withstand Zweilous's attacks. Zweilous also has some useful resistances to Fire, Grass, and Dark, as well as a Psychic immunity, which allows it to check Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Leafeon. That said, its typing also comes with very inconvenient weaknesses, most notably to Fighting and Ice, which isn't helped by its low Speed. Hustle also lowers the accuracy of Zweilous's physical moves, meaning that despite its power, Zweilous can easily whiff and accomplish nothing. Zweilous also competes with Fraxure as a hard-hitting physical Dragon, as Fraxure has better accuracy and the ability to boost its stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set could be used to lure fast revenge killers, but Zweilous will still be slower than Pokemon such as Floatzel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mawile prevent Zweilous from spamming its STAB moves and can easily OHKO it, and they can easily revenge kill it if it is locked into Outrage. However, Mr. Mime does not resist Crunch, while other Fairy-types such as Clefairy get dented by Head Smash on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Revenge killing is the easiest method of dealing with Zweilous, and it is helped by Zweilous's low Speed, several weaknesses, and tendency to get locked into Outrage. Particularly effective responses include Floatzel, Monferno, Rotom-F, and Articuno, which have super effective STAB moves to easily end Zweilous with.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While these Pokemon can't reliably switch safely into Zweilous, they are usually bulky enough to take one hit from it and respond accordingly, and they can prompt Zweilous to use Outrage or its coverage moves, which all have nasty side effects that can be exploited. Walls with powerful and/or super effective moves, such as Avalugg can retaliate for huge damage against a Zweilous that fails to KO them, whereas more passive walls such as Tangela and Pelipper can instead whittle down Zweilous with status and residual damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crunch is Zweilous's most reliable STAB move, making it the spammable attack of choice. Outrage is used as a nuke that can blow defensive cores open, but it prevents Zweilous from switching and leaves Zweilous easily revenge killed, so it should be used with care. Superpower smashes Steel-types not named Bronzor, most notably Probopass and Mawile, that resist Zweilous's Outrage and don't particularly mind Crunch, and hits bulky Pokemon such as Audino and Golem very hard without preventing Zweilous from switching. Head Smash OHKOes physically defensive Pelipper and 2HKOes Clefairy and Avalugg; however, it is extremely inaccurate due to Hustle and deals heavy recoil damage, so it should only be used as a last resort.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is for maximum destruction, and maximum Speed investment allows Zweilous to outrun as many walls as possible and Speed tie with the rare Rampardos. A Jolly nature is an option to outrun Pokemon such as Adamant Pawniard and Jolly Ursaring. Life Orb can be considered over Choice Band, but Choice Band's power and lack of recoil tends to make it the better item choice. Eviolite can be considered to reduce Zweilous's susceptibility to being revenge killed, but Zweilous appreciates the power of Choice Band, which boosts its wallbreaking ability, and Head Smash's recoil would offset Eviolite's bulk increase anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't expect Zweilous to last too long, as it functions like a glass cannon and is rather easily revenge killed. Zweilous should exploit a team's defensive link, such as Gourgeist, Bronzor, or Audino, and proceed to punch a giant hole in the opponent's team. If the opponent has Fairy- or Steel-types, refrain from using Outrage recklessly to avoid giving them free setup opportunities, and go for the safer Crunch. You can click Outrage and watch Pokemon drop like flies, although this exposes Zweilous to be picked off by faster Pokemon, so be wary of them if you want to keep Zweilous around for longer. Zweilous does have the coverage moves and power necessary to nail Outrage switch-ins for massive damage, so do keep that in mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zweilous has several weaknesses that should be covered if one is to make use of its wallbreaking abilities properly. Steel-types can shield Zweilous from Fairy-, Ice-, Bug-, and Dragon-type moves; Metang responds well to Mr. Mime and Regice, Klang can take advantage of foes that Zweilous has weakened, and Bronzor, Probopass, and Metang can set up Stealth Rock for Zweilous. Poison-types resist Bug-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type moves for Zweilous; Roselia can provide Spikes and Toxic Spikes support for Zweilous, while Curse Muk can be a threat after opposing Steel-types have been removed or weakened. Because Zweilous can punch holes into the opponent's team, fast sweepers such as Zebstrika, Floatzel, and Choice Scarf Leafeon can be used to clean up, while also covering for Zweilous against faster, offensive teams.</p> <p>Sticky Web support can be considered, as with a Jolly nature Zweilous can outspeed up to base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Raichu under Sticky Web; Leavanny is the best Pokemon for the job. Alternatively, Trick Room can be used instead, with the nature changed accordingly to Brave and the Speed IVs adjusted to 0; Duosion, Beheeyem, Dusknoir, and Gourgeist-XL make for good Trick Room setters.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crunch hits Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Kadabra and Dusknoir, which Zweilous walls, and is also Zweilous's most reliable STAB move, as it has the highest accuracy. Dragon Tail allows Zweilous to phaze the foe, which is especially useful against setup sweepers, and racks up damage together with entry hazards. Roar can be used over Dragon Tail if Dragon Tail's low accuracy is unappealing to you or if you want to be able to phaze Fairy-types. However, the extra damage Dragon Tail does to the foe is quite significant, as it makes it easier to wear down the opponent's team. Zweilous is affected by all entry hazards and status and has no passive recovery, so Rest is used so that Zweilous is not worn down too quickly. Sleep Talk makes Zweilous not a sitting duck after it has used Rest and also helps against some Sleep Powder users, most notably Roselia and Jumpluff. Thunder Wave is an option over Sleep Talk, as it cripples faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Monferno. However, Thunder Wave should only be considered if Zweilous has a cleric such as Lickilicky as teammate. Toxic is another option over Sleep Talk, as it cripples Pokemon that tend to switch into Zweilous, such as Avalugg and Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and Careful nature optimize Zweilous's special bulk. An Adamant nature is an option to get slightly more damage off on Pokemon that switch in. Eviolite grants a boost to both of Zweilous's defenses. Hustle is the only ability Zweilous can use, which makes it somewhat unreliable by making all of Zweilous's attacks inaccurate. However, the boost in power results in Zweilous hitting surprisingly hard for a wall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zweilous can switch in against various Pokemon, especially Fire-, Psychic-, Ghost-, and Electric-types such as Beheeyem, Floatzel, Kadabra, and Zebstrika, and rack up entry hazard damage by phazing the or simply defeating them with Crunch. Use Dragon Tail together with entry hazards from Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Roselia to slowly wear the opponent's team down. Watch out for moves that remove Zweilous's Eviolite, such as Leafeon's Knock Off, which Zweilous tends to be switched in against. However, Zweilous shouldn't be trying to take on most Pokemon that carry Knock Off and Trick. Do not hesitate to use Rest when Zweilous's health is low, as between the lack of passive recovery and having to take Volt Switches from Zebstrika, Zweilous's health might drop faster than you would like. It's not that hard for the opponent to remove entry hazards when Zweilous is on the field, so use Ghost-types such as Gourgeist to prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard users are great teammates for Zweilous, as they wear down the opponent's team very fast together with Dragon Tail. Audino offers Wish and Heal Bell support for Zweilous so that it doesn't have to rely on Rest too much. If you're using Thunder Wave or Toxic, Heal Bell is also very useful to wake Zweilous up after it has used Rest. Fairy-types such as Clefairy and Mawile easily take Zweilous out with their STAB moves so Pokemon that can take them on, such as Probopass and Bronzor, are good teammates. Ice-types such as Regice and Rotom-F also defeat Zweilous with ease, so Pokemon such as Klang and Grumpig are good teammates to cover that weakness. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir prevent entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin and have decent type synergy with Zweilous, as they are immune to Fighting and Zweilous covers their Ghost and Dark weaknesses. Other defensive Pokemon such as Beheeyem and Tangela appreciate Zweilous taking on special attackers with its many resistances and special bulk. Zweilous fits best into defensive and balanced teams, as its unique typing allows it to check Pokemon such as Floatzel and Zebstrika, which could otherwise break through their defensive cores.</p>"

  "Quilladin": {
    "overview": "<p>Quilladin's high Defense stat coupled with Eviolite and its access to reliable recovery in Synthesis allows it to reliably set up Spikes on many physical attackers in the tier, such as Golem, Mightyena, and Sawsbuck. While it competes with other, bulkier Grass-types for a team slot, Quilladin can be used over Tangela for its access to Spikes and over Roselia for its better physical bulk and resistance to Ground-type moves. Additionally, Quilladin's unique ability, Bulletproof, gives it an immunity to bomb- and ball-based attacks such as Sludge Bomb, Focus Blast, and Shadow Ball, meaning Pokemon like Roselia that are reliant on these moves can be used as setup fodder for it to lay Spikes. Alternatively, Quilladin can forgo a defensive spread in favor of a more offensive one so that it can take advantage of its access to Taunt in order to prevent slower Pokemon such as Probopass and Roselia from laying their entry hazards or prevent Defoggers like Vullaby and Vibrava from removing its Spikes. On the downside, however, Quilladin has low Special Defense, which can easily be exploited by faster special attackers with super effective coverage, such as Rotom-F and Simisear. What's more, Quilladin is reliant on its Eviolite in order to tank hits, meaning it is liable to be crippled by Knock Off from Pokemon like Krokorok and Pawniard. Despite these flaws, Quilladin is still overall an advantageous choice as a Spikes setter and excels on both balanced and offensive team archetypes as either a Taunt lead or a physically defensive wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With a specially defensive EV spread, Quilladin is able to check offensive Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour by surviving their Ice Beam and OHKOing with an uninvested Wood Hammer in return. Special Defense investment also allows Quilladin to use Synthesis on Zebstrika's Overheat, eventually forcing Zebstrika out due to Life Orb recoil and Special Attack drops. Leech Seed is an option on Quilladin's physically defensive set that can be used to whittle down foes while regaining a small portion of its HP back every turn; however, it is inferior to the recovery Synthesis provides and is difficult to fit over Taunt or Roar. Endeavor with Focus Sash can be used on Quilladin's Taunt lead set for a guaranteed layer of Spikes while simultaneously damaging foes heavily once Quilladin has been weakened sufficiently. On offensive sets, Pin Missile can be used to OHKO Kadabra by hitting it multiple times on the same turn and bypassing its Focus Sash while also hitting opposing Grass-types such as Leafeon and Sawsbuck. However, Zen Headbutt and Drain Punch often provide better offensive coverage than Pin Missile does. Toxic can be used on both defensive and offensive sets to whittle away at foes' HP and is especially effective when used together with Taunt to prevent foes from recovering HP lost due to Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that can hit Quilladin on its weaker Special Defense stat pressure it offensively and disallow the usage of Spikes or Synthesis. For example, Sap Sipper Zebstrika is able to outspeed and OHKO defensive Quilladin with Overheat while being immune to Seed Bomb and Wood Hammer. Other special attackers like Articuno and Rotom-F are able to threaten Quilladin by outspeeding it and OHKOing it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ninetales and Monferno are able to switch into Quilladin's STAB moves and set up on the turn Quilladin is forced out with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Dodrio, Drifblim, and Jumpluff take little damage from Quilladin's Seed Bomb and can threaten Quilladin out with STAB Acrobatics or, in Dodrio's Case, Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: If Quilladin is not running Taunt, Pokemon like Vullaby are able to switch into Quilladin's STAB moves and easily remove the Spikes it has set up. In particular, Swanna is able to outspeed Quilladin, threaten it out with its STAB Hurricane, and use Defog as Quilladin switches out.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Losing its Eviolite to Knock Off hampers Quilladin's ability to check the threats it beats, so Pokemon with access to Knock Off like Simisage and Armaldo are easily able to cripple Quilladin and follow up with a super effective move like Gunk Shot or X-Scissor.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Pokemon with access to Taunt, such as Grumpig and Misdreavus, are able to outspeed Quilladin and prevent it from setting up Spikes or using Synthesis. At the same time, they are able to incapacitate Quilladin with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, respectively.</p>",

      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes provides support for Quilladin's teammates by damaging switch-ins and possibly deactivating Sturdy and Focus Sashes. Taunt lets Quilladin prevent opposing entry hazard setup and removal while it sets up its own Spikes. The move can also be used to protect Quilladin from various status effects. Wood Hammer is Quilladin's STAB move of choice, and even uninvested, it is able to OHKO offensive Water-types such as Floatzel and Simipour. The recoil from Wood Hammer can also be used to KO Quilladin in order to avoid being hit by Rapid Spin. Zen Headbutt is used to hit Roselia hard on its weaker Defense stat after Taunt stops it from setting up Spikes, as well as hit predicted Monferno switch-ins that may try to use Quilladin as a free opportunity to set up Swords Dance or gain momentum via U-turn. Drain Punch is a secondary option that can be used to OHKO Pawniard after one layer of Spikes or some prior damage, 2HKO both Sawsbuck and Probopass, and break Bouffalant's Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bulletproof protects Quilladin from all bomb- and ball-based attacks, most notably Sludge Bomb, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast. Eviolite bolsters Quilladin's bulk, allowing it to reliably switch into predicted Ground-type attacks. A Jolly nature in conjunction with maximum Speed investment ensures that Quilladin outspeeds common entry hazard setters like Golem and Relicanth in order to prevent them from laying Stealth Rock. Quilladin uses maximum Attack investment in order to threaten Pokemon weak to its STAB Wood Hammer and coverage options more effectively, such as Roselia and Solrock. An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly in order to OHKO Pawniard with Drain Punch and Politoed with Wood Hammer while still outspeeding targets like Modest Gorebyss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Quilladin should use Taunt early-game against common leads like Golem in order to prevent the foe from setting up entry hazards. Quilladin can be preserved and used mid- and late-game so that it can use its Taunt to stop Defoggers like Vullaby from removing its own Spikes, as well as prevent walls like Audino and Clefairy from restoring their HP. On the turns following a successful Taunt, Quilladin should lay as many layers of Spikes as possible to weaken your opponent's team. In general, Quilladin should utilize its ability Bulletproof and resistances as a bulky Grass-type to find as many opportunities to lay Spikes as possible. Threatening out entry hazard setters like Roselia and Golem via its typing and ability will be conducive to keeping entry hazards on your opponent's side of the field and away from yours. Wood Hammer should be used against targets weak to Grass-type attacks, especially slower Pokemon like Politoed that are able to threaten Quilladin with their Ice-type coverage moves. If Quilladin is low on health, it can use Wood Hammer's recoil in order to KO itself before being hit by Rapid Spin so as to prevent its Spikes from being removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With its ability Thick Fat, Grumpig can be used to protect Quilladin from Ice- and Fire-types, such as Nasty Plot Simisear and Rotom-F. At the same time, Grumpig is also able to keep entry hazards on the field with its own Taunt, as well as rack up Spikes damage with Whirlwind. Stealth Rock setters such as Relicanth, Probopass, Golem, and Stunfisk help whittle down opposing teams in conjunction with Quilladin's Spikes, and provide it protection from Flying- and Fire-types like Dodrio and Rapidash. Misdreavus is an ideal partner given its ability to both spinblock and cripple slower Defoggers such as Vullaby and Vibrava with Taunt. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly are particularly good partners given their ability to deter the use of Defog. Similarly, Pokemon that are able to pressure Defoggers, such as Regice, Rotom-F, and Zebstrika, are all helpful for keeping Quilladin's Spikes on the field. Anti-lead Quilladin fits best on offensive teams, so sweepers like Nasty Plot Ninetales and Swords Dance Monferno especially appreciate the chip damage from Spikes, and they provide Quilladin with some much-needed resistances to Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-type attacks in return.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes damages Pokemon that attempt to switch into Quilladin and can consistently weaken your opponent's team. Roar should be used to rack up Spikes damage and to phaze Pokemon like Bouffalant attempting to set up Swords Dance behind a Substitute. Taunt is an option over Roar that, when run in tandem with a small amount of Speed investment, is able to prevent Vullaby's Defog from removing Spikes. Seed Bomb is defensive Quilladin's STAB move of choice and allows it to beat Ground-types like Stunfisk and Golem. Wood Hammer can be used over Seed Bomb without Attack investment for OHKOs on both Simipour and Floatzel; however, the recoil can be counterproductive, as Quilladin needs to stay at high health in order to reliably check Pokemon like Stoutland. Quilladin's most reliable form of recovery is Synthesis, and it is an essential tool that allows Quilladin to repeatedly switch into physical attackers. As a final option, defensive Quilladin can use Drain Punch to pressure Pawniard, rather than relying on Roar to phaze it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Quilladin uses Eviolite together with maximum investment in HP and Defense and an Impish nature in order to wall and set up Spikes on physical attackers like Gabite and Golem. Bulletproof provides Quilladin with useful immunities to bomb- and ball-based attacks, letting it switch into moves like Roselia's Sludge Bomb and Mr. Mime's Focus Blast. 36 EVs in Speed can be used with Taunt over Roar in order to prevent Vullaby from removing Quilladin's Spikes with Defog.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Quilladin can be used at any point in the match in order to counter physical attackers like Golem, Sawsbuck, and Mightyena. On the turn it forces out an opposing physical attacker, Quilladin should use this opportunity to set up a layer of Spikes. Quilladin needs to stay at high health in order to beat strong wallbreakers like Stoutland, so it should use Synthesis after switching into attacks. If Spikes has been set up and Quilladin is at high health, it can use this opportunity to rack up Spikes damage via Roar. Quilladin should be switched out of special attackers with super effective coverage moves, such as Ninetales and Regice. Additionally, Quilladin should also switch out of Knock Off users in order to preserve its Eviolite, as it is necessary to continuously beat the Pokemon it checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Quilladin relies on its Eviolite in order to consistently switch into physical threats, so Pokemon that are able to switch into Knock Off aimed at Quilladin, such as Muk and Monferno, are useful partners for being able to preserve its Eviolite. Quilladin appreciates partners that can accommodate its lower Special Defense stat, meaning Pokemon like Probopass and Audino that are able to switch into super effective attacks aimed at Quilladin and pivot out are especially useful. Camerupt can also switch into special attacks for Quilladin, especially Ice- and Fire-type moves, while being able to phaze foes and rack up entry hazard damage from Quilladin's Spikes and its own Stealth Rock at the same time. While Quilladin is able to hits from many physical attackers, it cannot switch into those it has a type disadvantage against, such as Dodrio and Monferno. To remedy this, Quilladin pairs well with checks to Flying- and Fire-types, like Golem and Altaria. Ghost-types like Misdreavus and Dusknoir are able to keep Quilladin's Spikes on the field by switching into Rapid Spin. Misdreavus also has access to Taunt, meaning it can stop slower Defoggers as well. Similarly, Pokemon like Pawniard and Purugly are excellent partners for being able to deter Defog with their access to Defiant. Generally, sweepers and cleaners that appreciate the prior damage that Quilladin's Spikes may provide are useful for picking off weakened threats mid- and late-game.</p>"

  "Gogoat": {
    "overview": "<p>Gogoat distinguishes itself from other Pokemon in the PU metagame with its good bulk along with reliable recovery in Milk Drink that allows it to survive throughout battles. Its typing gives it resistances to common offensive types such as Water, Ground, and Electric as well as immunity to Grass thanks to Sap Sipper. It has a very diverse offensive movepool, which gives it multiple options. On the downside, it is relatively weak without any boosts and it is very slow, making it vulnerable to status moves and revenge killers. It faces major competition from multiple Grass-types in the metagame, namely Roselia, Tangela, Jumpluff, and Leafeon, each of which has a niche over Gogoat, making it hard for Gogoat to earn a teamslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gogoat can run a more offensive EV spread to deal more immediate damage, although its Speed can hold it back from sweeping. It can also use Substitute + Leech Seed to slowly wear down foes and keep itself healthy, though it loses out on Bulk Up. It can also be used as a defensive wall, but it is outclassed by Tangela in this role. A mixed offensive set could be used to take advantage of its wide movepool, though it is easily revenge killed because of its low Speed. Rock Slide can be used in order to hit Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Dodrio, though it then misses out on Earthquake, which makes it setup fodder for Pokemon such as Pawniard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Dodrio resist Gogoat's main STAB move and are immune to Earthquake; they can also deal super effective damage to it in return.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp halves Gogoat's Attack stat, while Toxic or poison from Toxic Spikes puts it on a timer, forcing it to switch out; however, if Gogoat is carrying Substitute, it can avoid status.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash resist Gogoat's STAB move and can deal super effective damage to it, but Gogoat can KO them with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon such as Grumpig and Misdreavus can prevent Gogoat from setting up or healing; the former can deal a lot of damage to it with Psychic, while the latter can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Rotom-F and Articuno take little damage from Gogoat's attacks and deal super effective damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Roselia and Muk resist Horn Leech and can threaten Gogoat with their super effective STAB attacks, but must be wary of a boosted Earthquake.</p>",

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up boosts Gogoat's Attack and Defense stats, which allows it to progressively deal more damage and take more physical hits, making it harder to revenge kill. Horn Leech can deal good damage while recovering health, which increases Gogoat's longevity. Earthquake allows Gogoat to deal super effective damage to Fire-types such as Ninetales and Steel-types such as Pawniard, which resist Horn Leech. Milk Drink heals half of Gogoat's maximum HP, which helps it survive for longer amounts of time. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to avoid status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>232 HP EVs and 228 Special Defense EVs along with a Careful nature allow Gogoat to maximize its overall bulk, while 48 Attack EVs are used to OHKO Ninetales and 2HKO offensive Roselia at +1 Attack. Leftovers gives Gogoat passive recovery, allowing it to last longer and making it easier to set up. Sap Sipper grants Gogoat an immunity to Grass-type moves and boosts its Attack when it's hit by one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gogoat can be switched into a Grass-type move such as Leech Seed, but it should be wary switching into some Grass-types, such as Roselia and Leafeon, as the former can deal super effective damage to it with Sludge Bomb and the latter can deal massive damage if it sets up a Swords Dance before Gogoat has a chance to set up with Bulk Up. Gogoat shouldn't set up on faster Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Grumpig, as they can prevent it from doing so and then cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, respectively. It shouldn't stay in on a Pokemon that can inflict status upon it unless it is carrying Substitute. Gogoat should take advantage of bulkier but weaker Pokemon such as Audino and set up on them. Gogoat shouldn't be switched in when Toxic Spikes is present on its side of the field, as poison cripples it and limits how long it can stay in to set up. Gogoat can switch into and set up on Water-types such as Chinchou, although it ought to be wary of being burnt Scald. Horn Leech or Milk Drink should be used during Gogoat's free turns, especially if it has been weakened. Horn Leech should be the preferred move to use, as it recovers health and it has STAB bonus; use Earthquake if you predict a faster Fire-type to come in, though it's rather risky. If the opponent has a Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Gogoat should use Substitute to avoid status; it shouldn't be switched into Pokemon that can inflict status on it, such as Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gogoat appreciates Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Probopass and Gabite in order to help it take on some of its weaknesses, such as Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types. It also appreciates Spikes and Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Roselia and Venipede. Poison-types such as Muk are also useful for absorbing Toxic Spikes. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Armaldo and Pelipper are helpful to Gogoat to prevent it from taking unnecessary damage. Grumpig is a good partner for Gogoat, as it can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks that Gogoat is weak to as well as provide Heal Bell support; Audino also works well as a cleric to get rid of Gogoat's status afflictions as well as restore its health with Wish. Gogoat appreciates wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Rapidash, as they can weaken bulkier Pokemon for an easier sweep. Pokemon that are weak to Grass-type moves, such as Golem and Politoed, appreciate Gogoat's immunity to them. Gogoat synergizes well with Fire- and Water-types such as Rapidash and Simipour, as they can cover one another's weaknesses.</p>"

  "Furfrou": {
    "overview": "<p>Furfrou receives competition from other Normal-types such as Purugly and pivots such as Tangela, though it has a niche in its high Speed and Fur Coat, which allow it to outspeed common threats such as Ninetales and Simipour and make up for its bad Defense, letting it tank physical hits relatively well. Furfrou can work on balanced and bulky offensive teams, thanks to its mix of stats and variety of utility options, as its coverage is poor. Access to U-turn to gain momentum and Thunder Wave makes Furfrou provide some utility and fit well on VoltTurn teams as a pivot, keeping momentum and crippling the opponent's team with Paralysis. As its Attack isn't that high, Furfrou is walled by common walls such as Pelipper and Golem and unable to run purely offensive sets. Its typing also isn't great, as it leaves Furfrou with no resistances and a Ghost immunity, which isn't that useful because most Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, can deal with Furfrou well. The lack of reliable recovery also makes Furfrou easily worn down, especially if entry hazards are up, because it's used as a pivot and is often brought in to tank physical hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wild Charge is an option to lure Pelipper, but is otherwise worthless. Iron Tail can see usage to effectively hit Rock-types such as Armaldo and Golem, which commonly find themselves switching in against Furfrou, though it still doesn't deal a great amount of damage. Grass Knot is a decent choice as it deals a good amount of damage to Pokemon that usually find themselves switching in on Furfrou, especially Rock- and Ground-types such as Golem and Hippopotas, but it is extremely situational. Rest and Sleep Talk can be a good option to have at least some recovery, even if not reliable, which can help Furfrou if it has to constantly switch in on foes and tank lot of hits. A full utility set can be used, running a more defensive spread and Cotton Guard, Toxic, Roar, and Return, though it is Taunt bait, very passive and therefore takes too long to have an impact on a game, and outclassed by other defensive Pokemon such as Tangela and Probopass.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Armaldo and Golem take next to no damage from Return and Sucker Punch and can cripple Furfrou with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Pawniard, Klang, and Probopass can tank Return and Sucker Punch all day long and are able to use Furfrou as a setup fodder, set up Stealth Rock, or cripple it with Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Knock Off, but with some predictions they can get caught off-guard by U-turn or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Drifblim are immune to Return, Furfrou's main attacking tool, and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or set up on it, forcing Furfrou to switch most of the time and causing trouble to the team in general. However, they don't appreciate getting hit by Sucker Punch, which deals a decent amount of damage, and U-turn, which can bring in Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Many bulky Pokemon such as Avalugg and Pelipper can wall Furfrou easily due to their good defensive stats and wear it down over time.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Simipour and Ninetales can tank at least one hit from Furfrou, and they can threaten it thanks to its weaker Special Defense. Most special attackers hate being hit by Thunder Wave, but Pokemon such as Raichu are immune to it and usually carry super effective coverage to KO Furfrou with ease.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from entry hazards or status can severely cut Furfrou's HP, weakening it and making it setup fodder for threats such as Pawniard and Misdreavus.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn gains momentum and free turns for teammates, bringing them safely into the field, and makes a Furfrou a decent offensive pivot. Thunder Wave provides utility to the team, slowing down foes and supporting slow teammates, especially setup sweepers and cleaners. Return is Furfrou's main STAB move and best attacking tool against foes. Sucker Punch is a prediction-reliant priority attack, but it makes Furfrou harder to deal with for Pokemon such as Kadabra, which are faster but frail, and Electric-types such as Zebstrika and Raichu, which are immune to Thunder Wave. Sucker Punch can also allow Furfrou to pull off some more damage against a faster Pokemon if it can't afford to U-turn and is going to get sacrificed. Toxic can be used over Thunder Wave as an alternative way to cripple foes, as it puts a timer on troublesome setup sweepers and walls that find themselves switching in against Furfrou, such as Gourgeist-Super and Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Furfrou to spread Thunder Wave as fast as possible and outspeed common threats such as Simipour, Ninetales, and Leafeon. Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible with Return and Sucker Punch, making Furfrou a bit more threatening as an attacker. Furfrou can run a more defensive spread to let it tank moves easily by moving Attack investment to HP. Leftovers makes up a bit for the lack of recovery and helps Furfrou with residual damage. Fur Coat is the signature ability of Furfrou, letting it tank physical attacks with ease, therefore helping its terrible Defense stat and making it a viable pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Furfrou works best on offensive teams, as its teammates can make up for its mediocre offensive presence and appreciate Furfrou's pivoting to create free switches. It can also fit on balanced teams, but they generally prefer bulkier walls and tanks, so it has to fight for a spot. Furfrou should be used as a pivot, checking physical attackers and crippling foes with Thunder Wave or U-turning out to a more favorable matchup, but it has to still be wary of residual damage and strong attackers, as it lacks recovery. U-turn works best if the opponent is going to switch, as otherwise the Pokemon that is brought in will have to take an attack because of Furfrou's high Speed. In these situations it is preferred to let a bulkier Pokemon tank the upcoming hit. U-turn should be used when Furfrou happens to be slower than the opponent's Pokemon, as otherwise Furfrou should use one of its other attacks to keep its teammates from taking unnecessary damage. U-turn also has to be used early-game to gain momentum after baiting in common Pokemon such as Golem, Misdreavus, and Pelipper and to create free turns for teammates. Furfrou should pivot into physical attacks that teammates can't take. Return is the preferred move to spam against foes to wear them down, as Sucker Punch is weak and risky and should be used only to get out of sticky situations. Furfrou, thanks to its high Speed, alright Attack, and access to priority, can be brought in to revenge kill an opposing threatening Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its high Speed, good defenses, and access to U-turn, Furfrou can create VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Raichu and Pelipper. Pelipper also provides entry hazard removal support, which is appreciated by offensive teams in general. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Roselia are good in tandem with Furfrou, as entry hazard support is useful to weaken Furfrou's checks and counters and pressure the opponent's Pokemon, especially if running a VoltTurn core. Because of Furfrou's lack of recovery, Defog and Rapid users such as Pelipper and Armaldo are appreciated. Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard can be brought in by U-turn after Furfrou has baited in Ghost-types, and can KO or trap them. Strong setup sweepers, such as Leafeon and Ninetales, appreciate pivot support from Furfrou to receive a free turn to set up. Furfrou's damage output isn't that high, so wallbreakers such as Simipour and Flareon help deal with bulky Pokemon. Slower Pokemon such as Marowak and the aforementioned Flareon appreciate Thunder Wave support from Furfrou to slow down foes, easing their job as wallbreakers or sweepers.</p>"

  "Meowstic-F": {
    "overview": "<p>With its ability Competitive, Meowstic-F has a niche in being able to switch into a Defog and get a +2 Special Attack boost. However, Meowstic-F faces competition from other Psychic-types, such as Mr. Mime and Kadabra, which both outclass Meowstic-F on many points. Competitive is not reason enough to use it on most teams. As a Defog discourager, it also faces enormous competition from Pawniard, which is the more effective Pokemon in general; however, Meowstic-F has a better Speed tier and hits popular Pokemon such as Monferno and Roselia harder. Meowstic-F has trouble dealing with Dark-types such as Mightyena and Pawniard, as it cannot hit very hard until it gets a Special Attack boost. A combination of Meowstic-F's bad defensive stats and Speed tier, which leaves it outsped by common Choice Scarf users and faster Pokemon, such as Raichu and Floatzel, means that even with a Special Attack boost it won't be able to sweep.</p>",

      "Competitive(ly Terrible) Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Meowstic-F's strongest STAB move, hitting popular Fighting- and Poison-types such as Monferno and Muk for a lot of damage. Hidden Power Fighting helps Meowstic-F hit Dark- and Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Probopass, for super effective damage. Shadow Ball allows it to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Misdreavus, Dusclops, and Grumpig for super effective damage. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down threats such as Floatzel and Regice and prevents Meowstic-F from being a setup fodder against these Pokemon. Substitute can also be used to dodge status from Pokemon such as Grumpig and Sucker Punch from Pawniard and Mightyena.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs with a Timid Nature allow Meowstic-F to hit as hard as it can while outspeeding Pokemon such as Simipour, Dodrio, and Ninetales. Life Orb allows Meowstic-F to hit harder with all of its attacking moves at the cost of some of its health. The ability Competitive is needed, as it is Meowstic-F's only niche and will give it a +2 Special Attack boost whenever one of its stats gets lowered.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meowstic-F works best switching into Defog, which gives it a +2 Special Attack boost and allows it to hit very hard after. Try not to switch Meowstic into anything except Defog, as it is frail and won't take an attack well. Meowstic-F can also be used as a late-game cleaner if the opponent does not have a Defog user, but it needs faster Pokemon such as Zebstrika gone and special walls such as Lickilicky weakened. However, if the opponent does have a Defog user, it is best to use Meowstic-F as a wallbreaker once it gets the Competitive boost mid-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Venipede, Crustle, and Smeargle are also good partners, as they can set up entry hazards and force the foe to use Defog, which Meowstic-F can switch into to get a free +2 Special Attack boost. Entry hazard support also helps to weaken Meowstic-F's counters. Meowstic-F should only be used on entry hazard-reliant teams, as its ability discourages the use of the move Defog, which is an annoyance for these teams. Because of its lack of bulk, Meowstic-F needs free switches in, which can be provided by slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Pelipper or Probopass.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Toxic is a useful move to cripple special walls such as Audino more easily. Thunderbolt could be used to hit Water-types such as Pelipper for super effective damage. Calm Mind allows Meowstic-F to boost its damage output without relying on the foe to use Defog.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Audino, Clefairy, and Zweilous can switch into any move that Meowstic-F carries and proceed to do whatever they want. However, they have to be careful about switching in if Meowstic-F has gained a Competitive boost, as they risk being 2HKOed after just a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types check Meowstic-F very well because they can switch into its STAB move and hit Meowstic-F for super effective damage. Pawniard can trap Meowstic-F with Pursuit, set up a Swords Dance on the switch, or anticipate a Hidden Power Fighting and use Sucker Punch on Meowstic-F.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Rapidash and Ninjask can easily revenge kill Meowstic-F because of its lack of bulk.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because of its vulnerability to entry hazards, status, and Life Orb recoil, Meowstic-F gets worn down very quickly. Residual damage also helps in getting Meowstic-F revenge killed by priority users.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dedenne is a poor Pokemon in the PU metagame and is not worth using over other Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika, which have better Speed, more power, and better coverage. Although Dedenne has Fairy as its secondary typing, it lacks a special Fairy-type STAB move and lacks the bulk to utilize any resistances it provides. Its coverage consists of an Electric-type STAB move, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power, which means it struggles to get past Pokemon that resist Electric such as Stunfisk and Roselia. The only niche Dedenne has lies in its ability, Cheek Pouch; however, most Pokemon can OHKO or 2HKO it, meaning that the HP recovery is often useless.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dedenne has an alright support movepool including Nuzzle and Super Fang; however, it lacks the bulk to use them effectively. Eerie Impulse and Charm can make up for Dedenne's poor bulk by lowering the foe's offensive stats, but that makes Dedenne passive and Substitute fodder. Hidden Power Ice is Dedenne's only other offensive option, and it can hit Grass-types such as Jumpluff as well as some Ground-types, but most targets can take several hits from it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Type Advantage</strong>: Dedenne cannot touch Grass-types such as Roselia and Gogoat, which can set up Spikes and Bulk Up, respectively, and eventually KO Dedenne. Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Vibrava are immune to Electric, can deal major damage to Dedenne with their Ground-type STAB moves, and don't take much damage from Grass Knot. Dedenne struggles against most other Pokemon that resist Electric too, including Zebstrika, which is immune to Grass Knot, and Fraxure, which can set up with Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Grumpig and Audino can wall Dedenne even if it has multiple Special Attack boosts and can deal heavy damage to it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Rapidash can easily KO Dedenne after a little chip damage if it does not have a Substitute up. Zebstrika and Raichu can take Dedenne on even if it has set up a Substitute.</p>",

      "SubRecycle": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Using Substitute in conjunction with Petaya Berry allows Dedenne to reliably obtain a Special Attack boost in order to try damaging the opposing team. Recycle allows Dedenne to repeat its shenanigans multiple times due to Cheek Pouch recovery. Thunderbolt is its strongest STAB move, and Grass Knot is its best coverage move, hitting certain Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Golem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dedenne does not get much use from investment in bulk, whereas with Speed investment and a Timid nature it can outspeed Pokemon such as Dodrio, and Special Attack investment allows it to deal some damage. Cheek Pouch along with Petaya Berry lets it recover health while boosting its Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dedenne's main aim is to continuously boost its Special Attack while remaining at a high enough HP to possibly take a hit, so it should try to set up Substitutes on Pokemon it forces out, such as Prinplup, Dodrio, and Relicanth. Dedenne should keep using Substitute until its Petaya Berry activates, and from there it should either use Recycle to get more boosts or attack if it is threatened by its foe. Often one Petaya Berry boost is enough to threaten weakened teams, so Dedenne would rather be behind a Substitute than keep boosting. It should be wary against Roselia, which can use Dedenne as Spikes fodder without consequence, so in that position it would rather switch out even if it is behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dedenne works best on offensive teams that can pressure Pokemon that wall it and weaken the opponent's team for Dedenne to get KOs. Water- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Floatzel and Roselia can pressure Ground-types with double switches, and the latter can also set up Spikes to help pressure most of Dedenne's switch-ins. Fire- and Flying-types such as Rapidash and Dodrio pressure Grass-type Pokemon, while Dedenne can check Water-types for the former. Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Camerupt can check Electric-types, which can switch in on Dedenne for free, while also setting up Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes from Pokemon such as Roselia can help wear down foes while Dedenne stalls with Substitute and Recycle.</p>"

  "Carbink": {
    "overview": "<p>Carbink is faster and has greater overall bulk than most Stealth Rock users and lacks common 4x weaknesses, making it a viable choice as a Stealth Rock and sun setter in PU. Carbink's defensive typing means that it is a good check to attackers such as Ursaring and Stoutland, and its ability, Sturdy, lets it set up something even against foes that would OHKO it. It can also run a RestTalk set that enables it to last throughout the match and set up against the powerful foes that do not threaten it such as Stoutland and Dodrio. However, its lacking movepool does it no favors, and its overall bulk is undermined by a poor HP stat. Additionally, its typing leaves it with no shortage of weaknesses to types such as Grass, Water, and Ground. Finally, poor offensive presence renders it setup fodder, and it has no reliable recovery, so it is forced to run the aforementioned RestTalk set if it wants any longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge 2HKOes Ninetales after Stealth Rock damage. Toxic puts a timer on Carbink's foes, though it generally just wastes sun turns if Carbink sticks around long enough to use it. Carbink can set up dual screens, but struggles to get both screens and Stealth Rock up, and is outclassed at doing so by Pokemon such as Meowstic-M and Solrock due to its poor Speed and nonexistent offensive presence. Carbink can set up Trick Room for its teammates and proceed to use Explosion. Power Gem is an alternative to Moonblast that can be used should you be absolutely desperate for Carbink to have Rock-type coverage, though its lower power and inferior overall coverage means that you should definitely consider Moonblast before it. Carbink can try a defensive set that capitalizes on its ability to check some common threats, but it is still setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Simisear and Misdreavus can severely reduce Carbink's usefulness with Taunt, as it becomes unable to set up, recover, or support the team. However, they must be wary of using Taunt against sun support Carbink, as they risk having it bounced back with Magic Coat.</p> <p><strong>Attackers with Super Effective STAB Moves</strong>: Due to its low Speed stat and lack of investment, the mono-attacker set is forced out by plenty of common attackers such as Golem, Metang, Leafeon, and Floatzel, irrespective of the boosts that it might have acquired.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Gorebyss, Simipour, and Klang can easily set up on Carbink and prove troublesome for the rest of its team.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Moonblast</strong>: Pokemon that resist Moonblast can come in on Carbink and proceed to trouble it. For example, Ninetales can set up with Nasty Plot and use Energy Ball, and Steel-types such as Klang and Metang can KO it with ease or use it as an opportunity to use Shift Gear or Stealth Rock, respectively.</p>",

      "ROCK WITH EYES": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind compensates for Carbink's naturally lacking Special Attack and increases its special bulk. Moonblast is a STAB move with decent enough coverage that will do good damage after several uses of Calm Mind. Rest is Carbink's sole means of recovery and also removes status, while Sleep Talk allows Carbink to continue to boost its stats or attack while sleeping.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>HP and Defense are maximized to increase Carbink's physical bulk, as Calm Mind covers its Special Defense. Clear Body prevents Carbink's stats from being lowered, meaning that it won't be subject to the odd drop from a foe's attack or ability. Leftovers gives Carbink passive recovery, which increases its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send in Carbink against a Pokemon that doesn't threaten it such as Ursaring or Dodrio so that it can set up. Due to its poor Speed, regardless of the boosts it might have accumulated, Carbink generally shouldn't stay in when faced with a foe with a type advantage such as Floatzel, Tangela, or Golem. When Carbink has been worn down sufficiently, use Rest to restore health and then use Sleep Talk over the course of the two following turns. It is safest for Carbink to attempt to set up once its checks and counters have been worn down or outright KOed by teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates capable of dealing with Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types are ideal. For example, Tangela can dispatch most Water- and Ground-types, and Flareon can dispose of Grass-types. Toxic Spikes support from a Pokemon such as Roselia means that passive damage is inflicted on the opponent while Carbink sets up, and helps it beat other sweepers such as Bouffalant.</p>"

      "Sun Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sunny Day summons harsh sunlight, a boon for Fire-types and Chlorophyll Pokemon. Stealth Rock breaks Sturdy and Focus Sashes, and helps offensively inclined teammates net KOs with greater ease. Explosion allows Carbink to put a dent in something once it has set up both sun and Stealth Rock. Magic Coat lets Carbink bounce back status, entry hazards, and most notably, Taunt, which would otherwise render it a lot less useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP evens out Carbink's overall bulk, and maximum Speed lets it get up Stealth Rock and sun as fast as possible. Sturdy ensures that Carbink can summon weather or set up Stealth Rock even against opponents that would otherwise KO it, with the exception of Mold Breaker Pokemon. Heat Rock extends the duration of the sunlight to eight turns, allowing teammates to take advantage of it for as long as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Carbink functions well as a lead, though it can be brought in any time your team needs sun support. Carbink should always set up Stealth Rock first and explode after setting up both sunlight and Stealth Rock so as not to waste precious weather turns. If Carbink only has the opportunity to set up one thing before fainting, it should prioritize summoning the sun, unless teammates capable of taking advantage of it have fainted. If there is an important Pokemon such as Stoutland on the other team that Carbink checks, you should try to keep it alive for later on in the match. Magic Coat should be used if you predict that the foe will use Taunt or set up an entry hazard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set should only be used on dedicated weather teams. Pokemon that can take advantage of sun with their abilities and/or moves such as Weepinbell, Leafeon, Sawsbuck, and Ninetales are good teammates, as they have the potential to sweep with sun support. Carbink wants to be backed by a teammate that can summon sunlight later on the match such as Volbeat; Volbeat in particular can also use Encore to deal with the setup sweepers that try to use Carbink as setup bait.</p>"

  "Trevenant": {
    "overview": "<p>Trevenant's combination of a high Attack stat and access to STAB Wood Hammer makes it one of the strongest dedicated wallbreakers in PU. Additionally, its strong array of unique coverage options such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, which is largely unique to Trevenant, lets it take on common Grass checks such as Mawile and Altaria. This ability to 2HKO common Grass switch-ins gives Trevenant a unique niche of being able to possibly break through its, and all other Grass attackers, own common counters. Access to Natural Cure also gives Trevenant an additional niche over other Grass attackers and walls such as Leafeon and Gourgeist-XL. However, Trevenant's low Speed and competition from more competent Grass-types such as Leafeon, which is faster and has setup options, and Gourgeist-XL, which is bulkier overall, keep Trevenant from standing out on its own in both an offensive and defensive light.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Trick Room sets are also a possibility thanks to Trevenant's low Speed and high Attack and damage output, but they can face competition from Gourgeist-XL, which has Explosion and priority in the form of Shadow Sneak. These options allow Gourgeist-XL to support the team more and work outside of Trick Room, though it is ultimately notably weaker than Trevenant.</p> <p>Gimmick sets that utilize Harvest are also particularly tempting and popular, but they are usually not consistent enough to be worth the team slot. Lum Berry can be used to absorb status for Trevenant's teammates and possibly let it heal for free with Rest, but Trevenant is not bulky enough to consistently pull this strategy off and is eclipsed by Gourgeist-XL in almost all defensive sets. Another notable Harvest set of Sitrus Berry with Substitute and Leech Seed is also possible, but this is not advised because many threats in PU, such as Quilladin and Substitute Bouffalant, are largely unaffected by it and in a worst case scenario can use it as a setup opportunity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types:</strong> Walls such as Quilladin and defensive Tangela can switch in freely against Trevenant, only fearing Trick.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper Bouffalant:</strong> Bouffalant is immune to both of Trevenant's STAB options, forcing it to lock into Earthquake or Rock Slide, and can also Pursuit trap Trevenant. However Bouffalant can struggle to do much damage back, and Earthquake and Rock Slide both can break Bouffalant's Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types:</strong> Threats such as Dodrio can outspeed Trevenant and OHKO it with Brave Bird. On the other hand, walls such as Altaria and Vullaby can come in and wall a Trevenant that is locked into a resisted move. No Flying-types can safely switch in to Trevenant, though, as none appreciate getting hit by Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types:</strong> Threats such as Pawniard and Cacturne can force Trevenant out by threatening to outspeed and OHKO it. However, Trevenant can OHKO Pawniard with Earthquake and Cacturne with Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> Monferno, Ninetales, Rapidash, Combusken, and Simisear can all outspeed Trevenant and OHKO it with a STAB Fire move. None of these threats can freely switch in due to taking high damage from even a resisted Wood Hammer and the threat of a predicted Rock Slide or Earthquake, though Rapidash has the ability to heal off the damage taken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trevenant's Wood Hammer is chosen as the primary STAB option, as it is the most powerful Grass-type attack in the tier. Shadow Claw provides a secondary attack that hits walls such as Gourgeist-XL; however, it should be noted that locking into a Ghost move in PU can be detrimental, as PU has a large number of strong Normal-types that would take advantage of this. Rock Slide hits Flying-type Pokemon such as Vullaby and Fire-type Pokemon such as Rapidash, 2HKOing all of them. The last slot is quite customizable, but the recommended move is Earthquake for 2HKOing defensive Mawile even after an Intimidate. Other options include Trick to cripple any walls that may switch in; however, by giving the Choice Band away, Trevenant forfeits its ability to 2HKO many common Grass switch-ins such as Vullaby. Horn Leech is also an option for healing, since Trevenant can get worn down quickly through switching in and Wood Hammer recoil. Due to the lack in power, however, it is not recommended that Horn Leech replaces Wood Hammer; instead, it should work as a secondary and weaker Grass option if used at all.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs are set to always outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Mawile, which can force Trevenant out otherwise with a strong Knock Off. Trevenant can run 252 Speed to outspeed neutral-natured Cacturne; however, this is not recommended due to Cacturne's ability to OHKO it with Sucker Punch, which nullifies any Speed that Trevenant has. The leftover EVs are put into HP for some additional bulk, as Trevenant's natural bulk is fairly respectable. Choice Band is the item of choice to make Trevenant as strong as possible in conjunction with the Attack EVs and Adamant nature, which guarantees the 2HKO on many threats and switch-ins such as Vullaby and defensive Mawile. Natural Cure is used to heal off any burns so Trevenant is not crippled by them while also letting it act as a general status absorber for the rest of the team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trevenant is heavily reliant on the player's ability to properly predict their opponent. If predicted correctly, Trevenant has the ability to 2HKO most of the common Grass switch-ins PU has to offer. If the player predicts incorrectly, then whatever move Trevenant locks itself into is usually an easy switch-in for a Pokemon that either resists or is immune to the move. For example, locking into Shadow Claw gives a free switch for Stoutland, and locking into Wood Hammer gives a free switch for Vullaby. It is exceedingly important to predict often and predict well in order for Trevenant to succeed. Bring Trevenant in in the earlier parts of the game to soften the opposing team with its wallbreaking ability, but always be prepared to switch it back out. Additionally, thanks to Trevenant's decent natural bulk, coming in on resisted moves like an Earth Power from Stunfisk is also acceptable. Trevenant can also switch in on a Scald if necessary, as Natural Cure will get rid of the possible burn. Using Trevenant as a status absorber is a decent option for taking a Toxic or Thunder Wave for a partner while also affording a relatively free switch for Trevenant by simply healing the affliction on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trevenant's primary niche is its ability to weaken common Grass switch-ins, so a great partner for Trevenant is another Grass sweeper such as Leafeon or Jumpluff that appreciates this. Monferno and Pawniard are also notable options if you do not want to stack Grass-types, as they also appreciate targets such as Vullaby out of the way to ease their own sweep. Partners that can give Trevenant a free switch through U-turn or Volt Switch also work well, and choices such as Rotom-F and Monferno can succeed in this role. Additionally, while Trevenant is strong on its own, it still requires Stealth Rock on the field to solidify the 2HKO on some notable threats such as Vullaby. Thus, choices such as Metang and Mawile are good partners for both providing Stealth Rock and patching up some type weaknesses Trevenant has. Defensive partners can consist of choices such as Mawile, which can switch in on Flying and Dark attacks, and Altaria, which can switch in on Fire attacks. Having defensive partners for Trevenant is advised because Trevenant has to switch in and out on a regular basis, making reliable teammates to absorb the attack meant for Trevenant a strong asset to the team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gourgeist has an extremely tiny niche over other Gourgeist formes, being able to outspeed the entire unboosted PU metagame with a Choice Scarf without having to run a Jolly nature. Gourgeist can also Trick its foes a Choice item, locking them into an unfavorable move, and can scout items with Frisk. However, Leafeon is a superior user of Choice Scarf because of its better Speed and greater offensive presence. Gourgeist is also reliant on Destiny Bond, which can be very risky to get locked into. In addition to this, Gourgeist is outclassed by Gourgeist-XL and Tangela defensively because of their superior bulk, by Simisage and Leafeon offensively because of their higher offensive presence, and by Gourgeist-S as a SubSeeder because of its higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gourgeist could run a Substitute + Leech Seed set to wear down its foes along with Will-O-Wisp, but Gourgeist-S is better at this role thanks to its superior Speed. Gourgeist could run a physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Will-O-Wisp, Synthesis, Foul Play, and Seed Bomb to better function as a spinblocker, although Gourgeist-XL outclasses it in this role. Magic Coat is an option that allows Gourgeist to bounce back status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, but it is not recommended, as locking Gourgeist into Magic Coat will allow the opponent to take advantage of it. Fire Blast could be used to hit Grass-types such as Tangela, but Gourgeist lacks the space for it and it is quite weak. Shadow Sneak could be used to pick off foes such as Kadabra, but Gourgeist does not have the moveslot for it. Explosion could be used to get a teammate in safely without relying on the opposing Pokemon to attack, but it does not affect Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, and does little damage to Steel-types such as Probopass. Phantom Force could be used over Seed Bomb for more power, but it makes Gourgeist vulnerable to Normal-types such as Stoutland and takes two turns to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dodrio and Ninjask outspeed Gourgeist even if it has a Choice Scarf, and they don't have to worry about Destiny Bond. Once Gourgeist loses its Choice Scarf, Pokemon such as Stoutland and Zebstrika can KO it without worrying about Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As Gourgeist lacks a source of reliable recovery, damage from entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and status such as burns and poison can easily cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can Absorb Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, which can gain a boost from Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire, and Ursaring, which gains a Guts boost, can take advantage of Choice-locked Gourgeist. However, they must watch out for Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Gourgeist's typing leaves it weak to common Ice-types such as Articuno and Flying-types such as Swanna, but they must watch out for Destiny Bond. However, once Gourgeist loses its Choice Scarf, they are able to KO it without worrying about Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: As Gourgeist is worn down easily, priority attacks from the likes of Dusknoir can finish it off without their users having to worry about Destiny Bond, but they must watch out for Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

Seed Bomb is Gourgeist's strongest and most reliable attacking move, hitting Rock- and Water-types such as Golem and Simipour, and is great for wearing down foes in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp. Destiny Bond knocks out Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Simisear as well as allowing a teammate to get in safely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>212 EVs in Speed and a Choice Scarf allow Gourgeist to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and all Pokemon up to +1 Fraxure. 252 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature allow Gourgeist to hit as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are put in HP for added bulk. Frisk allows Gourgeist to scout out items such as Choice Scarf from Pokemon such as Rotom-F.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gourgeist should make use of its typing to switch into Pokemon such as Sawsbuck as well as Pokemon locked into unfavorable moves, such as Choice Scarf Raichu locked into Thunderbolt. When using Will-O-Wisp, watch out for Fire-types such as Rapidash and Guts users such as Ursaring, as they can absorb burn and use it to their advantage, as well as take advantage of a Choice-locked Gourgeist. Save Trick for a setup sweeper such as Clefairy or Klang so that you can lock it into an unfavorable move and remove its Eviolite, but be wary that once Gourgeist loses its Choice Scarf it won't be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Zebstrika and use Destiny Bond effectively.

Fire-types such as Rapidash and Ninetales can handle Ice-types such as Regice and Rotom-F, which threaten Gourgeist, while Gourgeist takes on Water-types such as Politoed for them. Bulky setup sweepers such as Klang and Beheeyem appreciate Gourgeist's ability to get rid of their threats with Destiny Bond, aiding their sweep.

It can check or counter many of the metagame's premier offensive Pokemon such as Golem, Leafeon, and Stoutland, and it has the added benefit of Ghost typing, which allows it to work as a spinblocker. However, Gourgeist-XL is fairly slow and faces competition from fellow defensive Grass-types including Roselia, Tangela, and Quilladin, especially due to its lack of access to entry hazards, and its unique Ghost / Grass typing leaves it weak to the common Dark-, Fire- and Ice-type attacks in the tier. Nevertheless, Gourgeist-XL has a solid niche as an easy catch-all on balanced and defensive teams due to its higher mixed bulk than other Grass-types and access to Will-O-Wisp and Foul Play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gourgeist-XL can run offensive sets such as Choice Band with Trick due to its solid Attack and good physical movepool. It also has the option of running Leech Seed and Protect over Seed Bomb and Synthesis as well as Rocky Helmet over Leftovers to rack up more residual damage and passive recovery, though this set loses offensive presence, is easily walled, and is set up on by more Pokemon depending on which move it uses. Rock Slide can also be used to hit most of Gourgeist-XL's common Ice- and Fire-type switch-ins for super effective damage. Phantom Force can be used as a stronger STAB move, although it can also be easily taken advantage of on the charging turn, while Shadow Sneak gives Gourgeist-XL priority to pick off weakened threats but is very weak. Toxic is an option over Will-O-Wisp, although burns are generally more useful for Gourgeist-XL to neuter physical attackers. Magic Coat is also a surprise option to reflect back entry hazards and status, but Gourgeist-XL generally misses the lost moveslot. Gourgeist-XL is also an effective Trick Room setter due to its low Speed and high bulk. An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD and a Careful nature can also be used but is not as effective due to Gourgeist-XL's low Special Defense and competition from Roselia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rapidash, Ninetales, and Torkoal are immune to Gourgeist-XL's Will-O-Wisp and take little damage from Seed Bomb, although Rapidash has to be careful about switching into Foul Play. Torkoal and Ninetales can use Gourgeist-XL for setup fodder and can threaten to OHKO or 2HKO it with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: PU's special Ice-types such as Rotom-F and Regice are able to switch in freely on Gourgeist-XL to threaten it out and are not crippled offensively by burns. While physical Ice-types such as Beartic are threatening to Gourgeist when given a free switch in, they can be crippled by burns and take much more from Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison constantly wear down Gourgeist, making it much more difficult for it to effectively wall Pokemon and recover lost health.</p> <p><strong>Roselia</strong>: Roselia takes little damage from either of Gourgeist-XL's offensive moves and has Natural Cure, which can heal burns and stop it from being permanently crippled. It can use Gourgeist-XL as a free setup opportunity to lay Spikes or Toxic Spikes, which also hinder Gourgeist-XL's effectiveness by making it more difficult for Gourgeist-XL to switch into strong physical attackers and poisoning it.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Guts or Flash Fire</strong>: Guts and Flash Fire users such as Ursaring and Rapidash can take advantage of Gourgeist-XL's use of Will-O-Wisp to potentially get a boost on the switch. However, both has to be careful about switching into a Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Taunt, Substitute, and Encore</strong>: These three moves can hinder Gourgeist-XL by stopping it from using its support moves, taking advantage of its non-damaging moves to get up a free Substitute, or locking it into an ineffective move. Common Pokemon such as Grumpig and Chatot can take advantage of Gourgeist-XL's reliance on non-attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Pokemon with Magic Guard such as Duosion and Clefairy can use Gourgeist-XL as a free opportunity to set up Calm Mind and Stealth Rock, respectively, because of their immunity to burn damage and high enough bulk to easily take any of Gourgeist-XL's offensive moves.</p>",

Frisk is used to scout out the opposing team's items.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Gourgeist-XL is capable of countering many of the metagame's premier attackers, its defensive prowess makes it an obvious switch-in, so be careful of constantly bringing Gourgeist-XL into the same situations in case of a double switch to a Pokemon that can take Gourgeist-XL on more effectively. Gourgeist-XL should spread burns as much as possible, but it should also be careful of Pokemon with Guts and Flash Fire, which can get a free switch in and hit hard with their boosted attacks. Gourgeist-XL can also block Rapid Spin due to its Ghost typing, although Cryogonal and Torkoal are able to defeat Gourgeist-XL with their super effective STAB attacks. Make sure that Gourgeist-XL stays healthy throughout the match by using Synthesis, as it needs to stay at higher health to take strong physical attacks such as Choice Banded Stoutland's Return. In addition, beware of switching it into common Water-types simply due to type advantage, as nearly all offensive Water-types carry Ice Beam and can do significant damage to Gourgeist-XL on the switch. Make sure to scout out sets before blindly switching in Gourgeist-XL, as some Pokemon can carry moves that can cripple it on the switch in, such as defensive Golem with Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gourgeist-XL's unique Ghost / Grass typing gives it incredible synergy with most of PU's non-Grass-type defensive staples. Probopass can cover Flying-types such as Dodrio as well as check Fire-types and trap Pawniard with Magnet Pull, while Gourgeist-XL can cover Probopass's Ground and Fighting weaknesses. Grumpig is a useful teammate for Gourgeist-XL, as it can counter the metagame's most threatening Ice-types and give Gourgeist-XL Heal Bell support in case of stray status, though running Grumpig comes at the cost of adding on a second Dark-type weakness. Gourgeist-XL also works well with common entry hazard setters such as Golem and Stunfisk, as it can cover their weaknesses to Grass- and Water-type moves as well as keep their Stealth Rock on the field by spinblocking. Gourgeist-XL also appreciates entry hazard removal by Pokemon such as Vullaby and Pelipper, as a lack of entry hazards makes it much easier for Gourgeist-XL to constantly switch into strong physical attackers and the removal of Toxic Spikes can prevent Gourgeist-XL from being crippled by status.</p>"
