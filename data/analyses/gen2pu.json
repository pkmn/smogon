        "description": "<p>Hydro Pump consistently 2HKOes Rapidash, Flareon, and Pineco and does noteworthy damage to Delibird, Weezing, and Magnemite. Surf, while significantly weaker, has much better accuracy and PP, making it potentially worthwhile if using a stall team. Sludge Bomb can spread chip damage with poison and, if it lands on Pineco or Porygon, can cripple them. Rapid Spin lets Tentacool sit forever in front of Pineco and clear its Spikes, and it can significantly delay or prevent Delibird from setting Spikes. Tentacool can also serve as a team's Thief absorber against Delibird, blocking it from stealing Leftovers from a different Pokemon. Protect can improve Tentacool's longevity by allowing it to grab Leftovers healing every time it hits the field. Tentacool can instead use Screech, which occasionally lets Tentacool win endgames where it would otherwise lose, such as against Octillery or Dewgong. Screech can also help a team position by making it easier for a teammate to force out the foe that switches into Tentacool and, if using Spikes alongside Tentacool, can spread chip damage onto the opposing team.</p> <p>Tentacool is the best pure Rapid Spin user in the tier, being immune to Toxic, faster than Pineco, and taking little from its Giga Drain or Hidden Power Water and Delibird's Ice Beam. Tentacool struggles heavily with dealing damage and lacks a resistance to Normal or Electric, making it often difficult to justify over Rapid Spin Graveler, but on highly defensive teams with an alternate check to Normal-types like Rhyhorn, Curse Hitmontop, or Shuckle, Tentacool can prove to be a potent roadblock to Spikes-reliant threats like Xatu and Rapidash. Tentacool works best on Shuckle stall or bulky teams that eschew Spikes and are anchored by either the core of Weezing and Dewgong or that of Gloom and a Fire-type like Ninetales or Rapidash. Tentacool appreciates their ability to account for its many weaknesses like Stantler and Primeape and bolsters the team's ability to handle Spikes offense.</p>"
