    "overview": "<p>Shiftry possesses several unique qualities that make it a decent, if niche, Defog user. Its typing and Synthesis allow it to reliably handle offensive threats like Jellicent, Trevenant, and Coil Sandaconda. These traits also let Shiftry easily threaten common entry hazard setters like Gigalith and Sandslash. Shiftry is also good at pressuring foes like Charizard and Doublade, which pester other entry hazard removers, because of its decent offenses and powerful STAB Knock Off. However, Shiftry's defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to many common threats, such as Ribombee and Archeops. Shiftry is also 4x weak to U-turn, which means it usually must cede momentum to users like Togedemaru and does not reliably check Wishiwashi. To make matters worse, Shiftry sits at an awkward Speed tier, with prevalent threats such as Gallade outrunning it and pressuring it out as a result. Finally, though Shiftry tends to be less passive than other entry hazard removers like Eldegoss and Whimsicott, they are more consistent due to their better defensive profiles and utility movepools.</p>",

Leaf Storm is Shiftry's strongest viable STAB move and doesn't become weaker if Shiftry gets burned. 96 Speed EVs let Shiftry outspeed Timid Jellicent. Pickpocket punishes foes like Audino for removing Shiftry's Heavy-Duty Boots by stealing a foes' item. Clerics such as Ribombee can keep Shiftry healthy in case it gets statused, which is not unlikely given it likes to switch in on defensive Water- and Ground-types. Ribombee also checks Fighting-types like Gallade and appreciates Shiftry for punishing switch-ins like Charizard with Knock Off. Shiftry should be paired with Pokemon that can exploit the Steel- and Poison-types that it tends to draw in. Doublade and Galarian Articuno are offensive Pokemon that fulfill this role and benefit from Shiftry removing entry hazards for them. Walls like Sandaconda and Wishiwashi also serve this purpose on top of better handling Gigalith. Sandaconda can also run Rocky Helmet to punish the use of U-turn, with Shiftry's typing making it easier to bait the move out.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gallade is a devastatingly powerful wallbreaker thanks to its strong STAB combination, excellent Attack stat, and solid coverage moves, which hit common physical walls such as Sandaconda and Doublade for super effective damage. With access to Shadow Sneak, it can pick off faster threats like Galarian Articuno and Whimsicott. Its STAB Close Combat is naturally strong in a tier with Rock- and Steel-types like Regirock and Togedemaru everywhere, and its Psychic-type STAB moves take on Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Comfey and Garbodor pretty well. With access to Swords Dance, Gallade can become even more powerful at the cost of losing coverage options. However, Gallade's Speed, while useful for outspeeding other slow wallbreakers like Centiskorch and Perrserker, is overall lackluster, and it relies heavily on ensuring faster foes like Ribombee and Sneasel are within Shadow Sneak range if it cannot survive a hit from them. Gallade's special bulk is decent, but its physical bulk is very subpar, which, combined with its few resistances and weaknesses to popular Fairy-, Flying-, and Ghost-type moves, leaves Gallade with little defensive utility. Finally, Gallade lacks recovery, and thus it gets quickly worn down by residual damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and stray hits.</p>",

Thunder Punch and Leaf Blade deny switch-ins such as defensive Charizard and Sandaconda. Knock Off hits bulky Psychic-types like Uxie and cripples other switch-ins like Jellicent. Muscle Band ensures 2HKOs on Pokemon like Quagsire and Hattrem with Close Combat and Knock Off, respectively. Assault Vest grants Gallade more defensive utility and allows it to survive one hit from super effective special attackers like Ribombee and Charizard, but it sacrifices power. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to avoid entry hazard damage, which can quickly wear Gallade down; however, Muscle Band is heavily recommended due to granting better odds for OHKOs and 2HKOs. Justified punishes weak Knock Offs from Pokemon like Audino. Gallade appreciates the support of pivots like Ninjask and Wishwashi; the former can threaten Gallade's offensive checks like Galarian Articuno and baits in Pokemon like Gigalith and Togedemaru for Gallade to threaten, while the latter can switch into Pokemon like Charizard that force Gallade out and provide a free switch via its slow U-turn.

Shadow Sneak is recommended to pick off faster foes like Ribombee at +2, but Knock Off can always be used to wear down switch-ins like Jellicent to sweep more easily later. Life Orb ensures the 2HKO with Close Combat on Quagsire, which can otherwise take a +2 hit due to Unaware, and provides more general power. Lum Berry is useful for avoiding status and allows Gallade to set up on Pokemon like Jellicent, Weezing, and Hattrem. A Jolly nature lets Gallade outspeed as many foes as possible, such as Modest Magmortar, and Speed tie with Timid Mesprit; an Adamant nature is unnecessary due to the sheer power behind a +2 Life Orb Gallade. This set fits mainly on more offensive teams due to its volatile nature, and it appreciates fast pivots like Ninjask and Archeops; in turn, they enjoy Gallade scaring out Togedemaru and Regirock, respectively.

Defog allows Charizard to clear all entry hazards as it forces out entry hazard setters like Weezing. Fighting-types like Gallade and Sawk appreciate Charizard pressuring their switch-ins such as Ribombee. In exchange, they can take on Charizard's answers like Gigalith and Lanturn. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Jellicent make for good partners thanks to their ability to take on attackers that force Charizard out like Lycanroc and Basculin, respectively. On sun teams, Solar Power is an option, as it makes Charizard significantly harder to switch into. On such teams, it should forego Hurricane for Solar Beam and run Weather Ball in the fourth moveslot, and Choice Specs is an option over Heavy-Duty Boots.

Mystical Fire can be used as a STAB option over Flamethrower to help Charizard take on Stored Power users, notably Mesprit, Uxie, and Claydol. The move also allows Charizard to beat Scald Jellicent alongside Toxic. Good teammates for Charizard would be Pokemon such as Perrserker and Trevenant, as they help further break down Rock- and Water-types such as Regirock and Jellicent, respectively. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Weezing also pair well with Charizard, setting entry hazards to help weaken its checks and absorbing Knock Off for it.

Charizard's middling Attack means it can't sweep unless the opposing team is very weakened; this makes wallbreakers like Vikavolt and Trevenant very appreciated.

    "overview": "<p>With access to Sand Rush, decent stats and typing, and an expansive movepool, Sandslash is a versatile offensive and defensive presence and a defining member of PU sand teams. Swords Dance Sandslash is one of the most dangerous sweepers in the tier. Under the effect of sand, it outspeeds almost the entire unboosted metagame and even some Choice Scarf users such as Gallade. Its typing and decent natural physical bulk give it ample setup opportunities against the common Rock- and Steel-types such as Gigalith and Togedemaru. Once boosted by Swords Dance, it has very few reliable defensive answers, and with access to useful coverage moves in Rock Slide, Leech Life, Knock Off, and Poison Jab, it can choose to narrow down its checks and counters even further. With its utility options in Rapid Spin, Spikes, and Knock Off, Sandslash also carves itself a niche as a versatile spinner that can compress several roles in one slot. Due to it's lack of reliable recovery along with its average stats, it can get worn down rather quickly, and can't be relied upon to repeatedly take on strong attackers like Perrserker. Furthermore, its poor special bulk and low Speed outside of sand leave it vulnerable to special attackers like Magneton, and common utility Pokemon like Wishiwashi, Eldegoss, and Levitate Weezing can exploit its overall passivity to gain momentum via U-turn, and either remove or set up entry hazards of their own.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Most Rock-weak Ground-resistant Pokemon like Ribombee, Charizard, and Archeops are already OHKOed by Rock Slide; as such, it is preferred over the stronger, but less accurate Stone Edge. Stone Edge can still be used to deal more damage to neutral targets when not running Leech Life or Poison Jab. After using Swords Dance, Leech Life in conjunction with Life Orb allows Sandslash to OHKO Eldegoss. It also allows Sandslash to threaten Tangela. With Knock Off, Sandslash can OHKO Trevenant and weaken Pokémon that wall it, namely Levitate Weezing, Quagsire, and Tangela. Sandslash can perform as an effective offensive spinner. Rapid Spin is also useful for boosting its Speed outside of sand. Instead of Leech Life, Poison Jab can be used to OHKO defensive Whimsicott. Life Orb is the most powerful choice of an item for a dedicated sweeper set, notably allowing Sandslash to OHKO Eldegoss. Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to improve Sandslash's longevity instead, particularly if an utility move is chosen as the last moveslot. A Jolly Nature can be considered to outspeed Choice Scarf Togedemaru and a few other uncommon Choice Scarf users like Gourgeist-S in sand, and Modest Magneton when unboosted, but this is typically not worth the drop in power.</p> <p>Swords Dance Sandslash should be ran with Gigalith, as it is the only viable sand setter in the tier. Spikes or Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Ferroseed, Weezing, or Qwilfish is appreciated to help Sandslash break through physically defensive walls like Sandaconda, Jellicent, and Wishiwashi. Ribombee and Whimsicott are useful utility Pokemon that can use U-turn to bring Sandslash safely into their typical Steel- and Rock-type switch-ins, like Togedemaru, Aggron, and Gigalith. Galarian Articuno and Vikavolt can switch in on Grass-types that check Sandslash and fire off powerful attacks or pivot with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Charizard is a great Gigalith magnet that also counters most Grass-types and wears down Wishiwashi and Jellicent with Toxic. Wallbreakers like Gallade can weaken walls like Tangela, while Sandslash itself can benefit sweepers such as Doublade, dealing heavy damage to their shared checks.</p>"

Spikes are chosen to wear down grounded targets, forming an entry hazard-stacking core with Gigalith. If you choose to not use Gigalith, Stealth Rock is a viable option. Leftovers give Sandslash a bit of passive recovery, improving its longevity. Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative that protects Sandslash from entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes. Sandslash's EV spread is quite flexible and it can easily run some Speed investment to outpace certain threats according to its team's needs. One of the possibilities is a spread of 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 Spe to outpace Adamant Perrserker outside of sand, while outspeeding Jolteon in sand.</p> <p>Although this set does not necessarily require sand in order to function, Gigalith is still recommended. With a Sand Rush boost, Sandslash is far less passive, and it can be situationally used to revenge kill Pokemon like Magmortar. Gigalith can also take care of most special attackers, including Charizard and Ribombee. Pokemon that can switch into bulky Grass- and Water-types are necessary, as these will often come in on Sandslash to remove its Spikes, block Rapid Spin, or gain momentum. Weezing is a solid switch-in to Grass-types and can help wear down the opposition with Toxic Spikes. Eldegoss can deal with most Water-types and provide cleric support. Running Eldegoss along with Sandslash also allows you to free up a moveslot that is typically occupied by Rapid Spin on either of the two Pokemon. Wallbreakers like Magneton and Galarian Articuno can take advantage of the likes of Eldegoss and Weezing. Doublade has good typing synergy with both Sandslash and Gigalith, can effectively spinblock and, as a late-game sweeper, benefits from Spikes wearing down its checks.</p>"

With a wide support movepool featuring moves like Stealth Rock and Encore, along with reliable recovery, it can compress roles on certain teams effectively. However, despite these qualities, Clefairy is heavily reliant on its item to keep its bulk. It also suffers from competition with other pure Fairy-types like Aromatisse and Comfey; the former has more physical bulk and is less hindered by its item being removed, while the latter has Taunt and priority in Triage Draining Kiss.

The metagame's abundance of Fairy-types can prove difficult for Alolan Persian, with Ribombee and Whimsicott even outspeeding it naturally. Offensively, with Alolan Persian's mediocre offensive stats and lack of a secondary typing, it is notably outclassed by Sneasel, which shares its base 115 Speed and Dark typing. However, Alolan Persian's high Speed and great utility moves stop it from being completely deadweight, specifically when paired with Choice Scarf, which allows it to cripple bulky threats with Switcheroo and serve as an extremely fast pivot. While Choice Scarf may seem redundant with Alolan Persian's high Speed, it allows Alolan Persian to outspeed even more Pokemon like Sand Rush Sandslash, +1 Flame Charge Silvally-Fairy, and non-Choice Scarf Whimsicott.</p>",

STAB Knock Off alongside Switcheroo gives Alolan Persian great item control, although remember that Knock Off would remove the foe's Choice Scarf after Switcheroo. Gunk Shot is Alolan Persian's best coverage option, hitting Fairy-types like Ribombee and Whimsicott, although be aware that Ribombee can also run Choice Scarf and outspeed Alolan Persian. Alternatively, Foul Play helps make up for Alolan Persian's low Attack stat, Toxic further cripples defensive threats, and Taunt stops moves like Gigalith's Stealth Rock or Tangela's Sleep Powder. Alolan Persian is best as a lead, using Switcheroo against common leads like Gigalith and Ferroseed or pivoting out to gain early momentum. Alolan Persian can continue to pivot in and out throughout the match and serve as speed control if still holding the Choice Scarf. As a pivot, Alolan Persian pairs well with other pivots like Wishiwashi and Vikavolt to maintain momentum, entry hazard removers like Silvally-Steel and Charizard to switch in more, and hazard setters like Mesprit and Sandslash to further punish the opponent's switches.

On top of naturally taking on Sneasel and Aggron due to its typing and bulk, Poliwrath also checks opposing Water-types like Wishiwashi thanks to Water Absorb, which distinguishes it from Quagsire. Poliwrath's movepool is also solid, containing good offensive and defensive tools that let it function as either a powerful wallbreaker or sturdy phazer. Beyond this, Poliwrath can potentially run other sets that make different use of its good traits, such as Choice Scarf, which mitigates its mediocre Speed tier. Despite being proficient in various areas, however, Poliwrath is not a master in any one of them. Poliwrath's meager offensive stats mean its damage output can be lackluster at times, which tends to make its defensive set even more passive. Poliwrath checks a lot of the tier, but common Pokemon like Galarian Articuno, Ribombee, and Charizard similarly threaten it. Finally, Poliwrath faces serious competition in its roles from more prevalent Pokemon. In terms of other wallbreakers, Basculin is faster and has access to priority and Flip Turn, while Jellicent can be harder to answer immediately due to Water Spout.

Earthquake deals more damage to Lanturn than Close Combat and can 2HKO Doublade from full after Stealth Rock. Poison Jab is another option that hits Fairy-types like Silvally-Fairy and Aromatisse harder than any other move Poliwrath viably runs. Fire-types such as Charizard and Centiskorch are good offensive checks to Grass- and Fairy-types and can support Poliwrath by wearing down its checks with either status or coverage and, in Charizard's case, removing entry hazards. In return, Poliwrath protects them against Water-type attacks and pressures switch-ins to them like Audino and Aggron. Galarian Articuno can similarly check Grass-types on top of bringing Poliwrath in safely with U-turn punishing its switch-ins with Future Sight.

As for Stealth Rock users, Gigalith is a notable example, since it also provides sand to further wear foes down and takes on Pokemon such as Charizard and Vikavolt. These entry hazard setters appreciate Poliwrath absorbing Knock Off and punishing threats like Sneasel looking to exploit them. Galarian Articuno can be devastating alongside Poliwrath thanks to Circle Throw, which may force a critical member of the opposing team to take heavy damage from or be KOed by Future Sight. In return, Poliwrath annoys Pokemon such as Aggron and Sneasel that can switch into or revenge kill Galarian Articuno. Ghost-types such as Trevenant and Silvally-Ghost are really good at exploiting Poliwrath, which makes having teammates like Tangela that can deal with them important.

Walls like Aromatisse, Weezing, and Gigalith serve as a safety net against faster Fire-types like Charizard and Magmortar that force Magneton out. Pokemon like Sandaconda and Eldegoss provide Magneton with speed control in Glare and Stun Spore, respectively, which gives it more opportunities to wallbreak by making it harder to immediately threaten out. These examples falter against Pokemon such as Trevenant, Whimsicott, and Silvally-Steel, all of which Magneton can potentially exploit.</p>"

  "Haunter": {
    "overview": "<p>Haunter finds a niche as a wallbreaker that opens holes for its teammates with a unique STAB combination that benefits from the tier's lack of common resistances to Ghost-types. Unlike other Ghost-type wallbreakers such as Trevenant and Silvally-Ghost, Shadow Ball allows Haunter to bypass pseudo-Ghost-type checks like itemless Togedemaru and Weezing. This allows teammates to run item removal, which makes it more flexible than Trevenant. Furthermore, the ability to choose its item, access to a secondary STAB to break past Normal-types more easily, and consistent super effective coverage against bulky Dark-types like Alolan Persian gives Haunter a valuable niche over Silvally-Ghost. While Haunter’s secondary STAB is less spammable, the ability to beat Fairy-types like Silvally-Fairy and Clefairy is useful. A mix of good damage output, solid Speed tier, and Sludge Bomb, which poisons switch-ins, make it a unique special attacker over the likes of Vikavolt and Ribombee. Haunter outpaces several offensive threats such as Gallade, Mesprit, and Centiskorch. However, it is left lacking against faster threats such as Archeops and Charizard, both of which force Haunter out. It also has a Speed tie with offensive Silvally formes and Timid Galarian Articuno, which makes it inconsistent at threatening them. Despite three immunities and a 4x resistance to U-turn, Haunter lacks meaningful defensive utility due to its horrendous bulk and thus only takes advantage of passive Pokemon that it resists like Aromatisse. Haunter is also switched into easily by blanket special walls such as Gigalith, Lanturn, Audino, and Togedemaru.</p>",

Will-O-Wisp allows Haunter to cripple Gigalith and other bulky walls. Energy Ball gives Haunter a stronger attack versus Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Regirock, Quagsire, and Wishiwashi. Disable takes advantage of Pokemon that have only one attack that can break Haunter's Substitute such as Palossand and Flamethrower Weezing. Life Orb gives Haunter the most power while allowing it to switch moves. Choice Specs in tandem with Trick or Energy Ball instead of Substitute is an option that increases Haunter's power, notably allowing it to 2HKO Togedemaru. However, it is then more easily pressured by Pokemon that can outspeed it like Charizard and more reliant on prediction to succeed. Haunter struggles against Gigalith commonly running Rock Blast, so partners with a type advantage such as Sandaconda and Poliwrath are appreciated. Sandaconda also provides entry hazard support, while Poliwrath can bait in checks like Aromatisse and Weezing for Haunter to threaten. Other Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gallade also make solid partners, as they both lure in Ghost-types like Palossand and Jellicent that Haunter can break through. In return, they check Normal- and Dark-type threats to Haunter like Audino and Absol.</p>"

Trick allows Haunter to cripple passive checks like Audino. Haunter is very frail, so it appreciates pivot support from the likes of Togedemaru and Archeops, which can bring Haunter in on their switch-ins like Weezing and Quagsire in order to wallbreak. Blanket special walls like Gigalith, Audino, and Lanturn can switch into Haunter multiple times during a match, so partners that can wear them down such as Ribombee and Charizard, are useful to Haunter.</p>"}

Exeggutor also pairs well with Pokemon such as Doublade and Sandslash, as it can help weaken their checks such as Quagsire and defensive Eldegoss. Exeggutor can struggle to take a hit when switching in, so slow pivots such as Wishiwashi and Lanturn are beneficial.

Knock Off gives Hitmonlee coverage for Pokemon like Mesprit and Silvally-Ghost, cripples Pokemon like Weezing, and hits Flying-types if Hitmonlee is not running Stone Edge. Stone Edge allows Hitmonlee to remove Flying-types such as Charizard with ease. Alternatively, Poison Jab gives Hitmonlee coverage for Fairy-types like Aromatisse and Silvally-Fairy. Hitmonlee requires either Pincurchin or Thwackey as a partner and therefore pairs well with other Terrain sweepers like Thievul.

A solid Special Attack stat and the threat of status make Weezing hard to switch into as well, and the ability to lay Toxic Spikes allows it to provide support for its team and wear down its checks. However, Weezing's low special bulk means even neutral strong special hits will take a big chunk out of its health. Weezing also has unreliable recovery, especially if it forgoes Black Sludge, since its only viable option is Pain Split. A weakness to Psychic also leaves it forced out by foes such as Mesprit and Gallade, and by those with Psychic-type coverage, such as Whimsicott and Ribombee, if it is chipped enough.

Additionally, it fulfills a lot of role compression for said teams thanks to its wonderful defensive typing providing an Electric immunity to foes like Togedemaru and Rotom and making it an excellent switch-in to Aggron. However, Quagsire's 4x weaknesses to Grass-types and Freeze-Dry leave it unable to check certain Pokemon such as mixed Silvally formes as well as Perrserker. Furthermore, Quagsire fails to halt incredibly strong wallbreakers like Life Orb Gallade and Choice Band Sawk in their tracks due to them comfortably 2HKOing it.

Haze is also a good option to prevent setup opportunities from foes like Ribombee and Silvally-Fairy. Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred for its ability to nullify entry hazards, since Quagsire's bulk isn't largely impressive to begin with. Taking 48 EVs from Defense and putting them in Special Defense allows Quagsire to switch into Quiver Dance Ribombee, although it makes it easier to overwhelm on the physical side. Weezing is an outstanding partner for Quagsire, as it provides a Toxic immunity and a switch-in to Grass-types like Trevenant. Audino provides cleric support and appreciates Quagsire's abilities to handle setup sweepers that take advantage of its passiveness, like Sandaconda. Charizard or Articuno makes for a fine Defogger to pair with Quagsire, as entry hazards can severely cripple Quagsire's longevity if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Toxic Spikes can also be used with Substitute users like Silvally-Ghost and Frosmoth. Intimidate helps against Perrserker and Silvally formes but can be a liability against Galarian Articuno, making Poison Point a fair option. Poison Point combined with Rocky Helmet can also be rather annoying for Pokemon such as Wishiwashi. Qwilfish pairs nicely with Ghost-types like Silvally-Ghost and Doublade because they spinblock, and in return they appreciate Spikes positioning them for a sweep. Rapid Spin users like Coalossal and Eldegoss synergize well with Qwilfish to keep Qwilfish's entry hazards up. Charizard appreciates both Spikes and Thunder Wave support and threatens Pokemon like Whimsicott for Qwilfish in return.

Sneasel's bulk is very low, making it difficult to switch into even the most passive defensive Pokemon, such as Eldegoss. It also doesn't help that not running Heavy-Duty Boots leaves Sneasel extremely vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, while running it leaves Sneasel somewhat weaker and more vulnerable to status. Sneasel also faces competition from other fast revenge killers such as Archeops and Whimsicott, which have more switch-in opportunities and pivoting.

Both of these Pokemon are able to remove entry hazards and can also check Fighting-types like Poliwrath, which can cause trouble for Sneasel. These Fighting-types, as well as defensive threats like Weezing and Silvally-Steel, should be taken out or greatly weakened for Sneasel before it starts setting up. Wallbreakers such as Charizard and Archeops are ideal for this role.

Spikes support from the likes of Garbodor and Qwilfish gives Ninjask an easier time wearing down its grounded switch-ins and securing a sweep. Garbodor can also weaken softer checks to Ninjask, such as Ferroseed, if it runs Corrosive Gas.

While it struggles to compete with other Ice-types like Frosmoth and Aurorus due to its lack of sweeping capabilities and natural speed, Abomasnow's coverage allows it to disrupt PU's defensive cores. Snow Warning is a huge asset in PU as well due to the prominence of Gigalith. However, Abomasnow is extremely prediction reliant and cannot hit very hard compared to more common wallbreakers like Choice Specs Galarian Articuno and Magneton.

Alternatively, Focus Blast leaves Abomasnow reliant on Blizzard to wear down Doublade but hits Audino harder. Rock Slide allows Abomasnow to OHKO Charizard and Frosmoth. Wood Hammer can be run with a Naive nature to 2HKO Gigalith after Stealth Rock, but be wary of recoil, especially given Abomasnow's Stealth Rock weakness. Gallade makes for a solid partner, as it can beat foes like Audino and Togedemaru that Abomasnow can struggle to get past due to their bulk and ability to scout. Other special attackers such as Jolteon and Ribombee appreciate Abomasnow's ability to wear down Gigalith. As Abomasnow is a Grass-type that provides very little defensive utility, Pokemon that can provide a secondary Water or Electric resistance like Wishiwashi and Sandslash are useful.

However, Magmortar is still outrun by many common threats such as Basculin and Silvally. Its merely fine Speed combined with its lacking physical bulk make Magmortar relatively simple to revenge kill compared to Charizard, which has much more long-term potential.

Taunt prevents recovery from the likes of Jellicent and Audino as well as Stealth Rock from setters like Druddigon in a pinch. Toxic is a good source of chip damage versus walls such as Jellicent and Gigalith. Overheat is a powerful nuke for Choice Specs Magmortar. Flame Charge is another option to turn Magmortar into a late-game cleaner, although it should only be run with Heavy-Duty Boots and a Timid nature. Magmortar can switch into a few resisted hits from Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Ribombee, but it is easily worn down and better brought in by pivots such as Lanturn and Rotom. It can also switch into predicted U-turns from Pokemon like Togedemaru and Archeops to fish for a burn with Flame Body, although this can be risky. Setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Ribombee make for great teammates that can effectively exploit Magmortar's breaking power. Magmortar greatly appreciates entry hazard removers if it opts to not run Heavy-Duty Boots: Silvally-Fairy and Rotom are good Defoggers that can also bring Magmortar in via pivoting.</p>"

However, its below average Attack often leaves it over-reliant on its own Spikes to get past defensive behemoths like Regirock, while its typing and bulk leave it easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Lycanroc, Choice Scarf Togedemaru, and Sneasel as well as priority moves like Sucker Punch and Accelrock.</p>",

Defensively, Rotom resists or is immune to various common attacks from Pokemon such as Archeops and Sandaconda, although has to watch out for common coverage moves such as Knock Off. Rotom's Speed allows it to outspeed threatening breakers such as Nasty Plot Mesprit and for its Choice Scarf set to outspeed other common Choice Scarf users like Mesprit. There are other Electric- and Ghost-types that give it competition as a Choice Scarf user, such as Togedemaru with its valuable Steel typing, and Haunter with its higher Special Attack alongside support moves such as Destiny Bond; both also have higher speed than Rotom.

Thunderbolt is an option for the last slot if you want to give Rotom more of an offensive presence, although Pain Split is an option to increase Rotom's longevity that pairs well with its low HP stat. Colbur Berry allows for Rotom to better check Fighting-types and other Knock Off users, such as Sawk, but Heavy-Duty Boots is a secondary option so it can take no damage from Stealth Rock. While Rotom does have a nice defensive typing, it is recommended to not switch it into attacks too many times, as it is easily worn down with its only okay bulk, especially without Pain Split.

Compared to competition like Swoobat and Comfey, it combines the STAB Stored Power and Toxic Spikes immunity of the former, the latter's ability to hit Dark-types super effectively, and its own formidable initial bulk, which surpasses both of theirs. With that and a solid Speed tier, it is difficult to take down, even with common offensive Pokemon like Charizard and Archeops. However, it is solely found on Grassy Terrain teams, as otherwise, it is too vulnerable to having its setup interrupted before it can sweep. It also can't deal with anti-setup options like Taunt and Encore from Pokemon like Jellicent and Sableye, and it must choose between Substitute and Rest in dealing with moves like Toxic, each of which has its own downsides. It lacks immediate power to force foes out, so even with Grassy Seed, it can be overwhelmed before it becomes a threat.

Thwackey is a mandatory partner for Uxie, as it is the only viable Grassy Terrian setter in the tier. It can also bring Uxie in with U-turn, giving Uxie an easier time to set up.

While Mesprit is a solid wallbreaker and has the speed to beat out slower offensive and defensive staples like Perrserker and Weezing, it's still outpaced by a large portion of the metagame. Combined with a lack of any reliable recovery, this gives Mesprit extreme longevity issues, particularly Choice Scarf sets, which will rarely outspeed any other boosted Pokemon. Furthermore, Mesprit's special coverage can be lacking at times, as Mesprit can struggle against Steel-types such as Aggron and Togedemaru.

Mesprit rarely has opportunities to guarantee a safe switch in and needs to be brought in when a teammate has been KOed, via good predictions, or using pivoting. Slow pivots such as Silvally-Fairy and Lanturn are great options to safely bring Mesprit in and form a VoltTurn core.

Colbur Berry is the preferred item, as it makes Mesprit harder to revenge kill with Dark-types like Sneasel and Absol and fare better against Fighting-types like Gallade. Life Orb is a more powerful item that might even remove the need for Mesprit to set up, but the lack of longevity is such that Mesprit is unlikely to have many chances to wallbreak. A Timid nature allows Mesprit to outspeed Modest Magmortar among other threats, but Modest can be run for more damage output. Whimsicott is a good partner because it can use U-turn to bring Mesprit in for easy setup opportunities on Pokemon such as Weezing. Due to Mesprit's lack of longevity, it often pairs well with a secondary wallbreaker like Magmortar or Archeops to keep up offensive pressure after Mesprit has been KOed.

Despite this set's lack of defensive investment, having few weaknesses means it often has the time to set up Stealth Rock and fire off multiple attacks. Few weaknesses and access to U-turn allow Mesprit to keep up momentum in a way few Stealth Rock users can, making it an ideal pick for more offensive teams. Its inability to deal much damage to special walls or Steel-types means that wallbreakers such as Trevenant and Charizard make for good partners. Mesprit appreciates Pokemon that can punish U-turn, such as Rocky Helmet Druddigon and Coalossal, which can discourage Pokemon like Togedemaru from freely pivoting versus Mesprit.

Even with Dazzling Gleam, Dark-types greatly hinder Mesprit's ability to freely spam Psychic, so a solid Dark-type answer such as Silvally-Fairy or Aromatisse is important. Mesprit is not the strongest wallbreaker around, so entry hazard setters such as Froslass and Regirock are advised to supplement its damage output. Weaker cleaners such as Dragon Dance Charizard and Quiver Dance Ribombee are ideal Pokemon to make use of Mesprit's wallbreaking.

Cleaners such as Ribombee and Silvally-Ghost really appreciate Sawk's ability to wear down their checks such as Sandaconda and Weezing.</p>"}

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott is a very versatile Pokemon; its good offensive Fairy typing and immaculate Speed tier let it revenge kill Pokemon such as Swords Dance Gallade, and it has a defensive presence with its great typing, Prankster, and ability to annoy opposing Pokemon with status moves. It is difficult to play around due to the unpredictability that comes with the great variety of sets it can run and its Speed. However, Whimsicott lacks the Special Attack and coverage to deal much damage. This makes it rely on utility and status moves to disrupt foes. It also lacks great defensive stats to constantly check threats such as Regirock.</p>",

        "description": "<p>U-turn is used to get Whimsicott out of bad matchups, especially after using Switcheroo, when its power is lower. Psychic hits Poison-types very hard, doing massive amounts of damage to Weezing and Garbodor, while being a reliable way to hit Fire-types neutrally. Hurricane hits Fire-types harder, 2HKOing Centiskorch and usually 2HKOing offensive Charizard, but is much less reliable than Psychic. Switcheroo is used to disrupt defensive cores, as Whimsicott can force in a Pokemon such as Charizard or Togedemaru that would otherwise wall it and limit the Pokemon's counterplay by giving it Choice Specs. Pixie Plate is an alternative to Choice Specs that sacrifices strength for flexibility, making prediction less of a factor. Whimsicott offensively pairs well with Pokemon that break Fire- and Steel-types, most notably Fighting-type Pokemon that can run Rock-type coverage such as Gurdurr and Sawk. Defensively, it appreciates support from Steel-types such as Aggron and Togedemaru to switch into Poison-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves, as well as a bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Lanturn to handle Fire- and Steel-types. With U-turn, Whimsicott can form a solid VoltTurn core with the latter partner.</p>"

U-turn is a crucial move for this set, allowing Whimsicott to let wallbreakers such as Lycanroc and Aggron in on its answers like Charizard and Togedemaru, respectively. Stun Spore provides speed control against fast Pokemon such as Ribombee on the switch so that Pokemon such as Gallade can sweep much more easily. Leech Seed gives Whimsicott a form of recovery, allowing it to exploit defensive Pokemon to increase its longevity. Whimsicott pairs very well with Pokemon that like its usual Steel-, Fire-, and Flying-type switch-ins crippled, such as Frosmoth.</p>"},

The combination of Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery almost makes up for the HP loss of using Substitute every turn, slowly draining the opposing Pokemon's HP until it's in range of a Moonblast. Psychic can be used to annoy Poison-types that can easily break its Substitute, while Knock Off is used to disrupt defensive Pokemon with recovery that can stall Leech Seed. Encore can be used to prevent setup Pokemon such as Ribombee from taking advantage of this set's passive nature while also stalling out the recovery of defensive Pokemon such as Wishiwashi. This set struggles most against Grass-types such as Tangela and Ferroseed, and Whimsicott must be wary of moves such as Dual Wingbeat from Archeops that both break its Substitute and damage it. Defensively, Whimsicott needs Pokemon such as Aggron and Galarian Stunfisk that can tank hits from Pokemon that can get past its Substitute, and these teammates can also benefit from the passive recovery that Leech Seed gives them. It also benefits from Flying- and Fire-types such as Charizard and Magmortar that deal with the Grass-types it struggles against.</p>"

A Choice Scarf Basculin can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as some boosted Pokemon like Choice Scarf Mesprit and +1 Silvally-Ghost. Its decent offensive stats allow it to hit hard physically while packing a solid Ice Beam for a few physical walls, like Tangela. However, Basculin lacks ways around common Water-resistant foes like Jellicent and Eldegoss, forcing it to pivot out most times. It is also frail, limiting its ability to come in on Pokemon it would otherwise force out, like Charizard and Gigalith. Since it pivots so much, it is prone to racking up chip damage from entry hazards, Iron Barbs, and Rocky Helmet. Finally, despite having a good Speed tier, it cannot deal with Unburden + Grassy Seed users like Thievul and Hitmonlee, so it pales in comparison to Choice Scarf Ribombee on that front.</p>",

Basculin struggles heavily with Water-resistant Pokemon and physically defensive walls, but it preys upon common special walls like Audino and Gigalith: partners like Galarian Articuno and Vikavolt pair well with Basculin, as they can come in on Basculin's checks, and Basculin can force out the special walls that check them. They also appreciate Basculin bringing them in with Flip Turn, forming a solid offensive pivoting core with it. Entry hazard setters like Sandslash can help Basculin wear down switch-ins like Tangela and Ferroseed, as they do not run Heavy-Duty Boots; this also helps Basculin clean late-game. Entry hazard removers like Eldegoss and the aforementioned Sandslash are equally important, as Basculin is constantly taking damage from entry hazards otherwise.</p>"

Earthquake and Stone Edge give Archeops near-perfect coverage that leaves its switch-ins restricted to a marginal few, such as Claydol, Palossand, and Regirock. Archeops also has a decent defensive typing, allowing it to check foes like Charizard in a pinch; however, it is held back by its poor defensive stats. It doesn't want to be the sole defensive switch-in to any foe, preferring to pivot in on resisted attacks such as Centiskorch's Fire Lash. Defeatist is a dreadful ability that basically makes Archeops useless if it drops below 50%, further hindering its ability to hard switch into foes like Galarian Articuno well and making it very dependent on both Heavy-Duty Boots and Roost.</p>",

Archeops is a great offensive entry hazard setter, and it provides defensive utility against foes such as Charizard. Heat Wave can be used as well to defeat Ferroseed and Frosmoth. Roost is an alternative to both Stealth Rock and Heat Wave for Archeops to stay out of Defeatist range. Teammates such as Frosmoth and Ribombee appreciate the damage Archeops provides against bulky Pokemon such as Gigalith and Aggron; Frosmoth is able to defeat Ground-types that Archeops struggles against, such as Sandaconda. Other teammates such as Doublade can help switch into foes that Archeops is forced out by, such as opposing Ribombee.</p>"},
      "Heavy-Duty Boots": {
        "description": "<p>U-turn is the preferred option in the third slot to generate momentum against foes like Palossand. Dual Wingbeat is an option that significantly pressures Grass-types like Eldegoss and Tangela as well as picking off offensive Grass- and Fighting-types like Trevenant and Gallade more reliably. Roost is necessary to offset HP loss that activates Defeatist. Heavy-Duty Boots is another important tool that prevents Archeops's Stealth Rock weakness from wearing it down into Defeatist range. Archeops fits best on offensive teams, and it should primarily be brought in via safe switches in to wallbreak or revenge kill threats such as Galarian Articuno and Magmortar, as its lack of defensive utility prevents it from getting many free turns otherwise. For this reason, partners with pivoting moves like Ribombee and Whimsicott work well with Archeops, and they form a pivot core if Archeops is using U-turn. Lanturn is another partner that can bring Archeops in safely, and it can absorb both Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Archeops as well as provide an additional check to Togedemaru. Froslass can help pressure many of Archeops's checks, like Palossand and Rhydon, thanks to its access to Spikes, notably bringing walls like Jellicent into 2HKO range of Stone Edge. Pokemon like Sneasel and Choice Specs Ribombee are problematic foes for Archeops, as they are faster and threaten to KO it, so Ferroseed and Choice Scarf Togedemaru can help pressure them.</p>"

Archeops can pretty much support every offensive threat in the tier, and it should almost always be the lead on the hyper offense teams it is used on. Nasty Plot Mesprit and Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy are offensive threats that appreciate the support Archeops provides. Galarian Articuno can punish Defog attempts with Competitive, letting it become more dangerous even if Stealth Rock gets removed. Offensive checks to Sneasel such as Ribombee are helpful because it can prevent Stealth Rock from being set with Triple Axel, assuming it lands two hits. Many of the aforementioned Pokemon can also bring Archeops in safely with U-turn to find opportunities to set Stealth Rock if it was unable to earlier on.</p>"

For one, its good physical bulk allows it to handle dangerous attackers such as Sneasel and Centiskorch and punish them with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath, while a pure Poison typing lets Garbodor naturally check common Grass- and Fairy-types like Ribombee, Eldegoss, and Whimsicott. Garbodor sets itself apart from Weezing as a defensive Poison-type with Spikes and an overall greater offensive presence, courtesy of its better Speed, stronger attacks, and potential disruptive tools in Toxic Spikes and Corrosive Gas, which lets it slot into fast-paced teams. However, Garbodor is walled by several common Pokemon that resist Gunk Shot and shrug off Stomping Tantrum, such as Jellicent, Archeops, and especially Sandslash, which can threaten it with Earthquake and remove its entry hazards with little issue. Furthermore, Garbodor's lackluster special bulk leaves it vulnerable to powerful special attackers such as Charizard and Wishiwashi. Garbodor also faces immense competition as a Spikes user on offensive teams from Qwilfish and Froslass, as the former is a better pivot thanks to its superior typing, ability, and utility options, while the latter can utilize its Ghost typing and Speed to lay down Spikes nearly unopposed.</p>",

Alternatively, Toxic Spikes effectively pressures defensive Pokemon such as Quagsire and Regirock and pivots such as Wishiwashi, while Corrosive Gas lets Garbodor remove important items from its checks, most notably Doublade's and Ferroseed's Eviolite. 56 Speed EVs allow Garbodor to outspeed Adamant Aggron. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe allows Garbodor to outspeed everything up to offensive Jellicent, giving it more opportunities to set Spikes. Garbodor can also choose to allot some of its Defense EVs into Attack to better pressure its offensive checks; a spread with 132 Attack allows it to OHKO Togedemaru with Stomping Tantrum and 2HKO most Charizard sets with Gunk Shot. Garbodor should be used alongside solid Charizard switch-ins such as Gigalith and Jellicent. Stealth Rock setters, such as the aforementioned Gigalith and Sandaconda, form excellent entry hazard-stacking cores with Garbodor. Garbodor also appreciates partners such as Ribombee and Sneasel that can pressure Sandslash and Hattrem, both of which counter Garbodor and prevent it from setting Spikes.</p>"

It can outpace most of the unboosted metagame, including Lycanroc and Galvantula, and pick off most offensive threats after they get somewhat weakened. Cincinno can be rather annoying to switch into as well, as Bullet Seed threatens Gigalith and common physically defensive Ground- and Water- types, and a lot of Cincinno's checks such as Ferroseed and Doublade don't appreciate losing their item. It is particularly strong against hyper offense teams, which typically lack any reliable defensive counterplay. However, Cinccino's damage output is often disappointing. Without a damage-boosting item, it fails to OHKO most threats, and it cannot break through many common Pokemon such as Regirock and most of the tier's Steel-types, for example Aggron and Togedemaru. In terms of defensive utility, Cincinno doesn't offer anything whatsoever. A poor defensive typing along with low stats mean that it's almost entirely dependent on free switches.</p>",

With Knock Off, Cinccino can support its team by removing important items from its checks, such as Ferroseed's Eviolite or Aggron's Leftovers. It also targets Ghost-types like Doublade. U-turn is useful for racking up chip damage; it also hits switch-ins like Eldegoss hard. Rock Blast is an option to better function as a revenge killer without a damage-boosting item, notably OHKOing Charizard and Archeops. Triple Axel also works to hit Archeops as well as Grass-types like Eldegoss and Gourgeist-S. Cinccino can also utilize Encore to break past some walls, locking them into status moves, and be a situational safety net against bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Mesprit. Protective Pads helps Cinccino against the tier's numerous Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs and Rough Skin users, such as Togedemaru and Druddigon. Heavy-Duty Boots is another way of limiting the amount of passive damage Cinccino suffers. Choice Band vastly improves Cinccino's prowess as a revenge killer by allowing it to OHKO offensive Charizard, Gallade, and several less common Pokemon like Galvantula. If Cinccino is not required to outspeed anything faster than Charizard, an Adamant nature can be used over Jolly for some additional power.</p> <p>With its pitiful defenses, Cinccino needs to be brought in with pivoting moves of teammates like Togedemaru and Wishiwashi.

Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Jellicent can take advantage of the likes of Aggron and Garbodor, and Cinccino can bring them in safely with U-turn on a predicted switch. Spikes from setters like Sandslash and Ferroseed works very well with Cinccino, as most of its checks lack reliable recovery and get worn down quickly after Knock Off removes their Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. By removing items from the likes of Doublade and wearing down Steel- and Poison-type walls, Cinccino can also benefit sweepers like Quiver Dance Ribombee and Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy.</p>"

Because of this, Jellicent is an effective switch-in to to various physical attackers such as Gallade and Perrserker. Jellicent also provides teams additional utility by punishing Water-types or Choice-locked attackers depending on if it's running Water Absorb or Cursed Body. Jellicent can also become an incredible offensive threat when equipped with Choice Specs thanks to its access to the rare and powerful Water Spout. However, defensive Jellicent can be rather passive due to its low offensive capabilities and reliance on status as the typical way of dealing damage.

Hex is preferred as the sole attacking move on this set because it pairs well with its status moves versus bulkier defensive answers such as Lanturn. Colbur Berry is the optimal item in order to weaken Knock Off from the likes of Sneasel or Gallade, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used in order to be immune to entry hazards. 76 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Jolly Glastrier. Gigalith makes a fantastic partner for Jellicent, as not only is it a good check to special attackers like Haunter, but with Sand Stream and hazard support, the residual damage Jellicent can spread with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic can severely cripple offensive answers like Whimsicott and Vikavolt. Conversely, Gigalith appreciates Jellicent's ability to check threats such as Perrserker and Sandaconda.

Special tanks like Audino can't switch into it, making the only real reliable switch-ins bulky, Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferroseed, opposing Wishiwashi, and Eldegoss. However, Shadow Ball hits these foes for neutral damage, forcing severe chip damage. Trick lets Jellicent cripple checks like Audino and Ferroseed. Surf is a strong secondary Water-type attack in case Jellicent gets worn down. Hydro Pump can also be run, as it has a higher base power, making it more difficult to switch into, notably 2HKOing Aromatisse and Tangela after Stealth Rock, but its inaccuracy makes it less reliable than Surf. Pairing Jellicent with pivots like Archeops or Togedemaru lets it get onto the field safely, usually against physical walls lured in by these pivots like Quagsire, Tangela, or Regirock. Entry hazards irritate Jellicent and weaken Water Spout, making deterring or removing teammates like Charizard, Hattrem, and Eldegoss incredibly valuable. Furthermore, it loves having entry hazard support to make it even harder to switch into, making entry hazard setters like Garbodor, Aggron, and Ferroseed valued teammates, as they also form a defensive core to handle Pokemon that offensively pressure Jellicent, such as Sneasel, Gallade, and Ribombee.

Its access to Volt Switch in combination with these traits also makes it a decent pivot. However, Galvantula's meager Special Attack hinders its overall damage output. Opting for Life Orb does make up for this, particularly if Galvantula runs Thunder, but doing so means forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots and limiting its staying power. Galvantula also faces competition from other Sticky Web setters in Ribombee and Vikavolt.

Heavy-Duty Boots negates the effects of entry hazards, giving Galvantula an easier time switching around and annoying offensive teams. Alternatively, Life Orb can be used to bolster Galvantula's offensive presence, giving it a high chance to OHKO Pokemon like defensive Mesprit with Bug Buzz after Stealth Rock. However, losing immunity to entry hazards and taking Life Orb recoil both decrease its overall longevity. Slower wallbreakers and setup sweepers like Haunter and Doublade very much appreciate Galvantula both slowing down potential revenge killers, like Basculin, with Sticky Web and generating momentum for them with Volt Switch.

These same traits alongside Iron Barbs allow Ferroseed to annoy pivots such as Togedemaru and removers like Comfey. Despite lacking reliable recovery, Leech Seed and Ferroseed's natural immunity to Toxic and chip damage from sand can make it incredibly hard for some teams to wear down.

Ferroseed's passivity also leaves it unable to do much in the face of setup sweepers like Sandslash, Sandaconda, and Cofagrigus.

However, Accelgor tends to be quite weak unless hitting a foe super effectively, and its meager bulk means even walls like Aromatisse often 2HKO it. It's also held back by its poor offensive typing in Bug and a weakness to common, good offensive types in Fire, Rock, and Flying. These flaws mean that Accelgor matches up poorly against entry hazard removers like Charizard and Coalossal. Accelgor also faces competition as an offensive Spiker from Froslass, which simultaneously spinblocks and boasts amazing utility options like Taunt and Destiny Bond.</p>",

Furthermore, Trevenant can heal while attacking with Horn Leech, which isn't weather-dependent like Synthesis, and isn't weak to Stealth Rock like Froslass. However, Trevenant lacks the bulk and longevity necessary to make full use of these good traits. While it outspeeds most defensive Pokemon, Trevenant is still incredibly slow, which, combined with its frailty and poor defensive typing, makes it easy to pressure and limits its opportunities to safely switch in.

While Frisk lets Trevenant scout for items and whether foes can be hit by Poltergeist, not being rendered useless by status thanks to Natural Cure is usually more useful. Using an Adamant nature maximizes Trevenant's damage output, but opting for a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Jolly Aggron and Perrserker.

Doublade is another great teammate, as it can also take advantage of some of the various walls that Ribombee finds itself unable to break, such as specially defensive Togedemaru. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are a huge nuisance to this particular set; they heavily dent Ribombee and make it easier to pick off with a priority move, meaning it has a harder time revenge killing Pokemon like Sneasel and Absol.

Furthermore, Wishiwashi's ability to maintain momentum makes it much easier to fit onto teams than other bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Quagsire, though it loses out on their better defensive typing, reliable recovery, and utility options. Schooling can be a large issue for Wishiwashi, especially since its reliance on Rest for recovery and the gamble that is Sleep Talk.

The 4 Speed EVs allow Wishiwashi to creep uninvested Gigalith despite the Speed-negating nature, although 0 Speed IVs are also an option to make Wishiwashi an even slower pivot. Wishiwashi is a great check against many offensive and defensive Pokemon like Sandslash and Weezing, so it can be brought in to endure their hits while weakening and potentially crippling them with a burn before pivoting to a teammate like Trevenant or Gallade to give them a chance to KO or set up. Wishiwashi can also be paired with other pivot users like Archeops and Magneton to maintain momentum while wearing down the foes.

Haze allows Mareanie to beat Doublade one-on-one, provided there are no critical hits. Infestation can be used to trap and remove defensive Pokemon such as Weezing and Eldegoss, allowing teammates such as Swords Dance Sandslash to sweep easier. A Calm nature is usually preferred, as this preserves Mareanie's Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed Doublade. However, a Sassy nature is better when running Poison Jab, as this allows Mareanie to do over 50% damage to Ribombee, meaning it can't Quiver Dance on it. Mareanie pairs particularly well with Gigalith + Sandslash cores, as Mareanie can absorb Toxic Spikes for them while dealing with the tier's Water-types such as Jellicent and Wishiwashi. Mareanie's passivity means it can be a detriment into setup sweepers that immediately threaten it, such as Sandslash.

These same defensive traits also allow Comfey to serve as a decent bulky Defogger, trading much of its offensive presence for more self-sufficiency and utility. However, when not boosted or hitting foes super effectively, Comfey tends to be very passive due to its mediocre Special Attack. Comfey also lacks coverage for Steel-types like Doublade and Ferroseed, allowing them to easily cut its sweep short or keep entry hazards up against it. Gigalith being so common hurts defensive Comfey, since Synthesis restores less HP in sand on top of already having low PP.

Stored Power provides better coverage and tends to be more devastating, though. With 64 Speed EVs, Comfey outspeeds Jolly Sandslash. Thwackey is a required partner, immediately setting Grassy Terrain for Comfey upon switch-in. Thwackey also shares a number of checks with Comfey, mainly Poison- and Steel-types, and can weaken them for it with Knock Off and U-turn. Comfey can't deal meaningful damage to Steel-types such as Doublade and Ferroseed, so Pokemon like Thievul and Hitmonlee are valuable teammates to have.

Since Comfey is walled by Steel- and Poison-types like Togedemaru and Garbodor, Pokemon like Charizard and Galarian Articuno are great teammates. Charizard notably gains the ability to drop Defog thanks to Comfey and also appreciates it switching into Knock Off, while Galarian Articuno benefits a lot from the pivoting support that Comfey provides. Pokemon that are especially vulnerable to Dark- and Fighting-types, such as Jellicent, Doublade, and Sneasel, like having Comfey to fall back on against such threats and can help make up for its passivity. Wish support from the likes of Togedemaru and Audino helps Comfey remain healthy without quickly burning through Synthesis's limited PP. These Pokemon also form a good defensive core with Comfey, switching into irksome foes like Ribombee for it. Comfey can potentially run either Aromatherapy or Toxic instead of Defog to act as a cleric or punish switch-ins like Charizard, respectively; however, such a tradeoff requires dedicating another teamslot to entry hazard removal and takes away from this set's main niche.</p>"

Alternatively, Toxic can be useful to wear down Pokemon like Jellicent, which cannot be trapped and hates taking it on the switch, and it makes Pyukumuku not dead weight against Pokemon with pivot moves, which get around Block. Pyukumuku only fits on stall teams, and it needs sturdy walls like Audino and Aromatisse to handle Pokemon that get past Pyukumuku despite Unaware, like Galarian Articuno and Gallade. Aromatisse and Audino are also good partners, since they can provide Heal Bell support. This is especially important when not running Rest to remedy opposing Toxic.

Parting Shot is able to keep momentum while also weakening the foe's attacks for your incoming Pokemon, although U-turn has the situational benefit of not triggering Galarian Articuno's Competitive, which already takes advantage of Defog. Other pivots like Wishiwashi and Vikavolt pair well with Silvally-Steel for maintaining momentum, with Wishiwashi and other walls such as Tangela and Audino forming a good defensive core. Audino is especially notable, since it can provide Silvally-Steel with some much-needed recovery with Wish and Heal Bell. Pokemon like Choice Specs Jellicent and Choice Band Sneasel appreciate Silvally-Steel's hazard removal and additional slow pivoting to give them free turns.</p>"

  "Turtonator": {
    "overview": "<p>Turtonator carves a small niche as a Fire-type on hyper offensive teams over the more commonly seen Charizard thanks to a great boosting move in Shell Smash, which allows it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame, making it difficult to revenge kill reliably. An excellent STAB combination along with high-powered STAB moves and valuable coverage in Flash Cannon makes it incredibly dangerous after a boost. However, Turtonator is held back by its low Speed, meaning it will most likely take heavy damage before safely setting up. It also has issues breaking through many top defensive Pokemon such as Gigalith, Wishiwashi, and Jellicent. Along with this, even after a Shell Smash it is still outsped by the commonly seen Ribombee as well as Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Mesprit, and it will either have a drop in its defensive stats after a boost or take heavy hazard damage upon switching in, depending on which item it's using.</p>",

One of Turtonator's best offensive checks is Ribombee, so partners that can check it are useful partners to have, such as Togedemaru and Doublade. Doublade in particular is also a great partner, as it can safely switch into Pokemon that can revenge kill Turtonator, such as opposing Lycanroc. Offensive Grass-types such as Thwackey and Silvally-Grass naturally scare out Water-types that otherwise check Turtonator, making them useful partners as well, while Frosmoth's natural special bulk allows it to safely Quiver Dance against Ribombee, and it can also set up on bulky Water-types that check Turtonator, such as Quagsire.</p>"

Its unique defensive typing and access to recovery in Wish also makes Togedemaru a useful special wall for taking on certain difficult threats such as Ribombee and Vikavolt. However, despite its excellent set of resistances, its mediocre bulk and an unreliable recovery move limits Togedemaru's ability to directly switch into threats. Sitting at base 96 Speed, it is one of the fastest Choice Scarf users and can outspeed boosted setup sweepers like Modest Ludicolo and Silvally-Fairy. However, Togedemaru fails to OHKO many of these Pokemon due to its only average Attack stat and coverage options. Togedemaru faces strong competition as a specially defensive Steel-type from Aggron and Galarian Stunfisk, who can set up Stealth Rock, and as a Wish passer from Audino due to its much higher HP stat.</p>",

Iron Barbs also helps defeat opposing Choice Scarf Togedemaru. While Togedemaru can be used throughout the match to tank some resisted hits, it is best brought in as a revenge killer or through slow pivots such as Lanturn and Silvally-Fairy, which form a VoltTurn core with it. Due to Togedemaru's poor damage output, it appreciates entry hazards from the likes of Gigalith and Froslass to help wear down its foes. Wallbreakers such as Whimsicott and Magmortar can also help wear down the opposing team so Togedemaru can potentially clean late-game, and they also serve as checks for threats to Togedemaru such as Palossand and Vikavolt, respectively.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots significantly decreases Togedemaru's weakness to Spikes, Leftovers helps make it slightly less reliant on Wish, and Rocky Helmet in tandem with Iron Barbs allows Togedemaru to punish a wide variety of contact attackers. However, Lightning Rod is preferred to stop Volt Switch users such as Vikavolt and Rotom. 8 Speed EVs allow Togedemaru to outspeed Adamant Centiskorch and Modest Frosmoth. Togedemaru can support many teammates lacking recovery with Wish, such as Weezing and Mesprit, both of which also help against the Fighting-and Ground-types that threaten Togedemaru.

Thievul can also use Choice Specs to become a dangerous wallbreaker that, with proper positioning, can force many switches and capitalize on them thanks to the 2x boost Stakeout gives. However, Thievul's Speed, while decent for an offensive Pokemon, often leaves it forced out by a myriad of faster threats like Archeops and Whimsicott. Its pure-Dark typing leaves it with little switch-in opportunities due to weaknesses to common Bug-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type moves, and its poor overall bulk gives it no favors. Thievul is also heavily reliant on prediction and boosts from either Nasty Plot or Stakeout to succeed, as its Special Attack is middling and Dark Pulse has mediocre Base Power. Finally, Thievul can be blanked by special walls such as Articuno and Aromatisse, which take little from all of Thievul's common moves.</p>",

The EVs allow Unburden Thievul to outspeed Choice Scarf Basculin and Adamant Sandslash in sand and take a Ribombee's Moonblast from full HP, while the rest is dumped into Defense to help Thievul tank priority moves better. A Timid nature with maximum Speed allows Unburden Thievul to outspeed foes like Choice Scarf Ribombee and +2 Hitmonlee, but these are seldom seen, and it makes Thievul unable to guarantee OHKOs on defensive Whimsicott and Wishiwashi at +2. Thwackey is a mandatory partner, as it is the only viable Grassy Surge user in the tier. Entry hazards setters like Coalossal and Sandslash can both remove and set entry hazards, providing solid role compression. Other sweepers are essential: Swoobat appreciates Thievul threatening Steel- and Rock-types like Ferroseed and Gigalith while it beats other special walls like Toxic Audino for Thievul, whereas Aurorus appreciates Thievul weakening special walls like Gigalith and Wishiwashi that threaten it.</p>"

However, because of Eldegoss's lackluster coverage and Special Attack, it must resort to status against Pokemon that resist Grass such as Perrserker and Weezing. It struggles the most against other Grass-type Pokemon, such as Ferroseed, Whimsicott, and Trevenant, since they're immune to Sleep Powder and Leech Seed.

Stun Spore is a very niche option but can be very beneficial for slower wallbreakers, such as Perrserker and Arctovish. Charm is mainly used to annoy Doublade, but it can still help with other physical attackers. Heavy-Duty Boots is by far the best item choice for Eldegoss, as it tends to switch in a lot to sponge damage. Eject Button is a risky item choice but can give a free switch for a wallbreaker, and once that's done Eldegoss switches into Poltergeist. However, sometimes a free switch doesn't do anything meaningful, and Eject Button won't activate versus Knock Off. Because Eldegoss lacks the coverage to meaningfully deal with Grass-resistant Pokemon, such as Charizard and Ribombee, Pokemon like Wishiwashi and Gigalith are a big help to switch into them. Eldegoss in return checks some of their switch-ins like Sandaconda and Jellicent while keeping them status free; other Pokemon that appreciate Eldegoss's cleric support are Togedemaru, Silvally-Ghost, and Perrserker, as they all must avoid burns to function at their best.</p>"

This Eldegoss variant can actually harm other Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Whimsicott, and even other Eldegoss with Pollen Puff. Synthesis is an option given this set's reduced bulk and ability to keep momentum better, but it's very team and matchup dependent, and Regenerator is usually enough to keep Eldegoss healthy. 36 Speed EVs are to outspeed the common defensive Jellicent. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps this offensive variant as healthy as possible, and it's especially useful versus Toxic Spikes. Pokemon such as Togedemaru, Archeops, and Charizard make for excellent teammates, as they can help lure in Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Sandaconda, Gigalith, and Jellicent for Eldegoss.

Fire-types like Charizard and Centiskorch are highly problematic for this set, so Rock-types like Regirock and Gigalith are great teammates for checking them. Both can also set Stealth Rock for Perrserker. Charizard can scorch the Steel-types that wall this set like Ferroseed and defensive Togedemaru, and it appreciates Perrserker smashing the aforementioned Rock-types, as well as KOing Lanturn and Jellicent. Spikes setters like Garbodor and Qwilfish can help give Perrserker an easier time wallbreaking—one layer of Spikes guarantees an OHKO on Regirock with a +2 Iron Head. Both can also switch into the Fighting-types Perrserker is weak to, such as Hitmonlee. Fast cleaners like Archeops and Ribombee can take advantage of the holes Perrserker can punch in teams.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Close Combat hits opposing Steel-types such as Aggron and Ferroseed, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter. Seed Bomb hits the Water-types that resist Perrserker's STAB Iron Head, OHKOing Quagsire and 2HKOing Jellicent. U-turn allows Perrserker to scout switch-ins and safely bring in a teammate. Double-Edge OHKOes Charizard and Centiskorch on the switch if running Tough Claws, two Pokemon that otherwise switch into Perrserker with ease. Tough Claws is the preferred ability on this set, as it powers up all of Perrserker's moves bar Seed Bomb. Steely Spirit can still be used, as it allows Perrserker to 2HKO Sandaconda and Palossand with a slightly stronger Iron Head. This set serves the dual roles of wallbreaker and offensive pivot. Against more defensive teams, Perrserker can use its massive power to smash defensive Pokemon like Regirock and Gigalith, as well as switching into predicted Stealth Rock and Toxic. Against offensive teams, it's best used to check physically frail Pokemon like Galarian Articuno and Ribombee, and it can use the forced switches to safely bring in a teammate with U-turn or fire off a strong attack. Fast Pokemon like Archeops and Choice Specs Ribombee are good teammates to threaten the more offensive teams Perrserker struggles with, while Perrserker can threaten the bulkier teams they struggle with. They all also appreciate the free switches Perrserker can give them with U-turn.</p>"

It has the natural Defense to withstand strong attacks from Pokemon like Lycanroc and various Silvally formes. Runerigus is also capable of being a setup sweeper to become less passive and take advantage of Pokemon like Toxic Audino expecting to just wear it down. However, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common wallbreakers like Trevenant and Sneasel. Also, Runerigus cannot reliably spin block against Eldegoss and is setup fodder for Pokemon like Ribombee.</p>",

Earthquake hits Magmortar and Charizard using Roost, but Body Press can be used for more damage against switch-ins like Ferroseed while still hitting typical Earthquake targets like Regirock and Gigalith. Will-O-Wisp cripples Archeops and deters Swords Dance Silvally formes. Toxic Spikes lets Runerigus spread more status and support setup sweepers like Charizard and Gallade. Poltergeist is an alternative to hit Pokemon like Whimsicott and Ribombee as well as opposing Ghost-types like Haunter. Rest gives Runerigus some form of recovery and pairs nicely with clerics like Ribombee and Eldegoss that can threaten foes such as opposing Sneasel and Wishiwashi that Runerigus struggles against.

Full Defense investment maximizes Body Press's power, but a specially defensive spread can be used to more comfortably boost against Ribombee and Charizard. Rest is Runerigus's only means of recovery and prevents it from being worn down by Toxic. Body Press allows it to capitalize on Iron Defense further and hit extremely hard. Leftovers provides passive recovery to lessen the need to use Rest, but Chesto Berry can be used for a free Rest and to have an easier time snowballing. Runerigus is completely walled by opposing Ghost-types like Froslass and Haunter with this set, so it benefits from Dark-types like Sneasel to pressure them. Weezing can spread burns to give Runerigus more setup opportunities and use Toxic Spikes to prevent Ghost-types like Jellicent and Gourgeist from stalling it out. Fighting-types like Poliwrath and Gallade can check opposing Dark- and Ice-types like Silvally-Dark and Sneasel and draw in bulky Pokemon like Quagsire and Sandaconda that Runerigus can use as setup fodder. Runerigus is also vulnerable to Pokemon such as Trevenant and Choice Specs Whimsicott that can break past it before it can boost high enough, so offensive checks to them like Charizard and Togedemaru are appreciated.</p>"

Alcremie has some advantages over the other Fairy-types in the tier, distinguishing itself from Aromatisse with its combination of Calm Mind + Recover and from Ribombee with its better bulk and pure Fairy typing. Alcremie also learns Mystical Fire, which allows it to threaten Steel-types such as Doublade more effectively than its competition. Additionally, Alcremie's ability Aroma Veil makes it particularly difficult to stop after one or two Calm Mind boosts, as it can't be afflicted by Taunt or Encore from the likes of Jellicent and Whimsicott. However, Ribombee is usually a better choice due to its much higher Speed, while Aromatisse is bulkier overall.</p>",

Alternatively, Mystical Fire gives Alcremie more of an immediate offensive presence, as it can punish switches into common Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Doublade. Aromatherapy makes it difficult to stop Calm Mind Alcremie with status moves such as Toxic, and provides team support on Mystical Fire sets. Alternatively, Acid Armor can be run alongside Calm Mind, allowing Alcremie to set up on both physical attackers such as Gallade and weak special attackers such as Jellicent. However, this makes Alcremie vulnerable to status, so a similar set with Rest and Stored Power instead of Recover and Dazzling Gleam can be run instead. The valuable Aromatherapy support Alcremie provides makes defensive teammates that dislike status such as Tangela and Jellicent good partners. Alcremie's Aromatherapy also pairs well with Pokemon that regularly run Rest, such as Wishiwashi. Alternatively, it can allow some Pokemon, such as Gigalith and Ferroseed, to run Rest when they otherwise wouldn't. Alcremie also appreciates teammates that can handle powerful Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Silvally-Steel, which makes Doublade and Quagsire good partners.</p>"

  "Arctovish": {
    "overview": "<p>Arctovish is a Pokemon with middling stats and awful typing. Its one saving grace is the move Fishious Rend, which, combined with Choice Band, has tremendous wallbreaking power when Arctovish moves first. However, its Ice typing makes Arctovish weak to Stealth Rock and STAB moves from prime Fishious Rend targets, such as Gigalith, Regirock, and Aggron, requiring predictions to get in safely on them. Unfortunately, the problems don't end there. Arctovish's low Speed means faster attackers such as Silvally-Fairy and Mesprit will often win one-on-one. Other slow wallbreakers such as Centiskorch and Trevenant have considerably easier times getting in on defensive Pokemon like Eldegoss. There's also the ever-prevalent Jellicent, which thoroughly shuts down Fishious Rend.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Use Fishious Rend": {
        "description": "<p>To utilize Arctovish to its fullest, besides using Fishious Rend, predict when opponents will try to check it with a Water-immune Pokemon like Jellicent, Poliwrath, or Arctovish. Then, using a coverage move or switching to a teammate is imperative. The most common roadblock for Arctovish is going to be Jellicent, so Crunch is always needed; it also helps out with certain faster attackers such as Silvally-Ghost and Mesprit. Psychic Fangs is only truly needed for niche Psychic-weak Pokemon like Poliwrath and Qwilfish, as both of Arctovish's STAB moves deal with other targets far more reliably. Because Fishious Rend doubles in power, the Water-resistant Pokemon able to come in on Arctovish are very limited: Pokemon such as Eldegoss, Ferroseed, and Wishiwashi all must stay healthy to switch in on Fishious Rend, and Grass-types such as Eldegoss and Tangela have to risk swapping into Icicle Crash. A Choice Scarf set isn't worthwhile despite Arctovish's relatively low Speed, as it loses the power needed to break through the previously mentioned Water-resistant Pokemon and still fails to outspeed fast Pokemon like Galvantula, Sneasel, and Ribombee. Arctovish appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Gigalith, Weezing, and Ferroseed, as the support helps whittle down Pokemon like Jellicent, Tangela, and Ferroseed. Teammates like Magneton, Archeops, and Mesprit can lure in defensive Pokemon like Audino, Gigalith, and Sandaconda and safely pivot into Arctovish using Volt Switch and U-turn.</p>"

  "Glastrier": {
    "overview": "<p>Glastrier's astronomical Attack stat along with a great offensive typing and useful coverage in Close Combat, Crunch, and High Horsepower gives it a niche as a potent wallbreaker. Additionally, great natural bulk even uninvested lets Glastrier take neutral hits reasonably well from a plethora of threats in the tier. However, what it has in offensive power, Glastrier lacks in defensive utility. Despite its great bulk, Glastrier's poor defensive typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock and leaves it vulnerable to foes like Charizard, Gallade, and Lycanroc. Glastrier's miserable Speed stat only exacerbates this issue, leaving it outsped by Pokemon like Weezing and Jellicent and makes it prone to being revenge killed by the likes of Gallade, Galarian Articuno, and Centiskorch. In addition to this, Glastrier struggles to make progress against Pokemon like Levitate Weezing, Quagsire, and Doublade, making its performance as a wallbreaker somewhat questionable against more defensively-oriented teams. Furthermore, it faces stiff competition as an Ice-type wallbreaker from Sneasel, which boasts better Speed, a more useful offensive typing that gives it access to STAB Knock Off, and a stronger Ice-type STAB attack in Triple Axel.</p>",

High Horsepower is an option that lets Glastrier hit Neutralizing Gas Weezing, Lanturn, and Doublade harder while also synergizing better with Close Combat. However, it provides less important coverage than Crunch, making it inferior much of the time.</p> <p>Glastrier's defensive shortcomings due to its Ice typing and miserable Speed mean that support from pivots such as Ribombee, Wishiwashi, and Mesprit is essential for it. Grass-types like Eldegoss, Thwackey, and Whimsicott make for excellent partners, as they can break through Water-types like Quagsire and Lanturn that would otherwise inhibit Glastrier’s offensive potential. Eldegoss provides much-appreciated entry hazard removal in the case that Glastrier loses its item, and Whimsicott provides great utility in Sleep Powder and Knock Off to punish switch-ins like Centiskorch and Lanturn while also having a flexible offensive presence that allows it to assist versus Pokemon like Weezing and Quagsire. Thwackey provides useful Grassy Terrain support, which gives Glastrier better overall longevity. Charizard is another excellent offensive partner, as it can assist with breaking through Pokemon such as Weezing and Centiskorch while appreciating Glastrier's ability to break through Gigalith.</p>"
