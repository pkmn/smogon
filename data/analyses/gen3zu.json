    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Specially defensive Wartortle can opt for Hidden Power Grass to match up better against Corsola, Clamperl, and offensive Wartortle, but this is extremely situational. On defensive sets, Haze can remove the boosts from common pinch Berry users such as Beedrill and Anorith. Rapid Spin provides team support, as Spikes tends to wear down common teammates for Wartortle; however, due to how uncommon Spikes is, Rapid Spin is seldom worth dropping a coverage or support move for.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Flaaffy and Magnemite threaten Wartortle with Thunderbolt, while Wartortle is unable to 2HKO either with Surf. Voltorb is worth mentioning, as it not only outpaces Wartortle even after a Salac Berry boost but also 2HKOes Wartortle if it is healthy.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Specially defensive Gloom is the premier Wartortle check, as it can shrug off an Ice Beam and is immune to Toxic. Tropius, on the other hand, is 2HKOed by Ice Beam, meaning it has enough time to use Sunny Day and then Solar Beam to OHKO Wartortle. More niche options such as Sunflora, Lombre, and Weepinbell can also prove to be an issue. However, the former two must be wary of Toxic, while Weepinbell can be dispatched with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Clamperl and Porygon can 2HKO Wartortle with Hidden Power Grass and Thunderbolt, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Repeated Hits</strong>: Wartortle is still 2HKOed by Double-Edge from Choice Band Aipom and Doduo despite its physical bulk. Its lack of recovery beyond Leftovers leaves it unable to take many attacks from Choice Band Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Doduo</strong>: Choice Band Doduo is the only priority user capable of removing Wartortle at 25% HP with its Quick Attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its solid bulk and mono Water typing, Wartortle functions exceptionally well as a bulky attacker. This allows it to threaten Rock- and Ground-types, cementing it as one of the best answers to Anorith, Onix, and Rhyhorn. Surf threatens the aforementioned Rock- and Ground-types and can be powered up by Torrent to heavily damage bulkier Pokemon like Ariados, Castform, and Mightyena. Ice Beam allows Wartortle to threaten Tropius and physically defensive Gloom. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO bulky Clamperl and Corsola, which threaten Wartortle. Toxic allows Wartortle to threaten other Water-types such as Seaking, Chinchou, and Wartortle. Refresh maintains Wartortle's staying power, curing status from Pokemon such as Mightyena and Koffing. Protect is required to fully use Wartortle's defensive capabilities, as it allows Wartortle to scout against Choice Band users such as Aipom, Doduo, and Anorith and rack up passive recovery from Leftovers. Wartortle's HP and Defense investment ensures it can force a trade with Choice Band Aipom if it uses Double-Edge; Wartortle wins the matchup if Aipoms opts to go for Return instead. Wartortle's Special Attack investment allows it to always 3HKO max HP Mightyena with no Special Defense investment.</p> <p>Bulky offense and balanced teams greatly appreciate Wartortle's ability to trade with Aipom and check Rock- and Ground-types. However, Wartortle is unable to do both of these jobs simultaneously. For this reason, Wartortle appreciates other physically defensive Pokemon, such as Onix, Mightyena, and Koffing, as teammates. Onix pairs exceptionally well with Wartortle, as it can wall Aipom and threaten Anorith with Rock Slide, while Onix appreciates Wartortle coming in on opposing Water-types. Mightyena threatens and removes specially defensive Gloom, which otherwise completely walls Wartortle. Moreover, Fire-types such as Ponyta and Quilava can also check Grass-types like Gloom and Sunflora. These Fire-types also appreciate Wartortle as a dedicated Rock- and Ground-type check, as it can stomach hits from Onix and Rhyhorn. Physical wallbreakers, including Aipom, Doduo, Volbeat, and Anorith, can threaten and remove specially defensive Pokemon that Wartortle struggles with, such as Porygon, Gloom, Delcatty, and Noctowl. Wartortle also struggles with faster special attackers like Seaking, Flaaffy, and Voltorb, so specially defensive Pokemon like Delcatty, Porygon, and Gloom pair well with it. Delcatty and Wartortle pair exceptionally well together, as Delcatty can pass Wish to Wartortle, improving its overall longevity. Additionally, Wartortle can switch into Rock-types such as Onix and Rhyhorn, which Delcatty lures in. If Wartortle lacks Refresh, then Heal Bell users, most notably Delcatty and Mightyena, pair well with it.</p>"

Surf allows Wartortle to threaten Koffing as well as Rock- and Ground-types such as Cubone, Onix, and Rhyhorn. Seismic Toss is Wartortle's most consistent attacking move, as it allows Wartortle to chip switch-ins such as Flaaffy, Noctowl, and Porygon, forcing the latter two to use Rest or Recover. Alternatively, Toxic compensates for Surf's inability to chip other Water-types like Seaking and Wartortle, threatens Porygon, and forces Noctowl to use Rest. Refresh allows Wartortle to shrug off burn and poison, which otherwise severely limit its effectiveness in defensive roles. Protect allows Wartortle to gain passive recovery from Leftovers more easily and provides an excellent opportunity to scout Choice Band users such as Seaking, Aipom, and Doduo.</p> <p>Wartortle fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a reliable defensive answer to Ponyta. Grounded Double-Edge users such as Aipom and Ponyta appreciate Wartortle's defensive value against Rock- and Ground-types such as Onix, Rhyhorn, and Anorith. In return, these Pokemon check specially defensive foes such as Noctowl and Porygon. Pokemon that can check Flaaffy, such as Onix, Porygon, and specially defensive Gloom, pair well with Wartortle. If Wartortle lacks Refresh, Heal Bell users such as Mightyena, Delcatty, and Flaaffy make good partners. Flaaffy is especially worth noting, as it can threaten Water-types such as Tentacool, Wartortle, and Seaking. Toxic absorbers such as Gloom, Koffing, and Ariados also pair well with Wartortle. Ariados, Gloom, and Koffing are notable teammates, as they heavily appreciate Wartortle's ability to check Fire-types. Pokemon that can check Grass-type such as Doduo, Ponyta, Quilava, and Tropius, help Wartortle deal with threats like Gloom.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Wartortle's respectable Special Attack and access to Torrent allow it to function as a late-game sweeper and wallbreaker. Substitute increases Wartortle's chances of receiving boosts from both Torrent and Salac Berry. With a Torrent boost, Hydro Pump proves extremely hard to switch into for Pokemon that don't resist Water, with only specially defensive Noctowl not being 2HKOed. Hidden Power Grass threatens opposing Water-types such as Corsola, Seaking, and Wartortle. Rain Dance allows Wartortle to set rain for itself and any other teammates that may benefit, such as Seaking. Additionally, rain allows Wartortle's Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump to 2HKO Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't, such as specially defensive Noctowl and Swords Dance Tentacool. Rain Dance also allows Wartortle to stifle recovery from Synthesis and Moonlight users such as Gloom, Tropius, and Dustox. Ice Beam threatens Tropius and Gloom, which otherwise wall Wartortle. Wartortle's Speed investment, coupled with a Salac Berry boost, lets it outspeed the entire metagame, bar Voltorb, allowing it to sweep. Wartortle's HP investment ensures that it is left with 25% HP after three Substitutes. 12 Defense EVs ensure that Wartortle isn't KOed by Quick Attack from Ponyta or Volbeat when at 25% HP.</p> <p>This set functions best on rain and hyper offense teams. Other Pokemon that appreciate Rain Dance support, such as Seaking, Lombre, and Horsea, pair well with Wartortle. Seaking and Wartortle form a particularly powerful combination, as the two can weaken each other's checks, such as Noctowl, Castform, and Porygon. Other special attackers like Quilava, Flaaffy, and Voltorb similarly pair well with Wartortle. Voltorb is particularly worth noting because it can function as an excellent lead Rain Dance user, which allows Wartortle space to run Ice Beam. Physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Doduo, and Anorith are excellent partners, as they can weaken or heavily remove special walls like Noctowl and Porygon. Wartortle appreciates secondary setup sweepers and cleaners such as Beedrill, Anorith, and Ariados, as they allow it to be more flexible in deciding whether to wallbreak or sweep. Wartortle appreciates teammates like Lombre and Ariados that can threaten faster checks such as Voltorb.</p>"

Paired with its above-average Speed tier, it is a frightening lead, particularly versus slower leads like Snorunt, Cyndaquil, and Spoink. Sleep Powder's nigh-perfect accuracy allows Butterfree to put switch-ins or opposing leads to sleep, which makes them deadweight for most of the game. Psychic is Butterfree's strongest move, and thanks to the rarity of viable Dark- and Steel-types, it is almost drawback-free. Hidden Power Grass allows Butterfree to OHKO offensive Rhyhorn while also threatening Ground-types such as Cubone and Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Giga Drain is an option to provide Butterfree a form of recovery that helps complement Morning Sun's low PP, though it also has low PP and is weaker. Morning Sun provides Butterfree with reliable recovery and allows it to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Butterfree can opt to use Stun Spore alongside Sleep Powder in order to neuter faster threats such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Elekid. If Stun Spore is used over Morning Sun, Butterfree appreciates the limited recovery that Leftovers and Giga Drain provide.</p> <p>Butterfree fits best on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate the free turns that Sleep Powder provides. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Spoink, Seaking, and Chinchou, pair up nicely with Butterfree. Chinchou is worth noting due to its additional resistances to Ice and Electric. Its access to Thunder Wave means Butterfree's team can also spread status more easily. Wallbreakers such as Aipom, Castform, and Elekid all appreciate the opportunity to switch in on sleeping Pokemon. Aipom can act as an offensive pivot for Butterfree, as it threatens Butterfree's checks with Double-Edge and Brick Break. Likewise, Castform is worth mentioning, as it can tank special moves from Butterfree's checks and deal heavy damage in return. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, Cubone, and Spoink appreciate the setup opportunity that Sleep Powder and Stun Spore provides them. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn, Aron, Magnemite, and Nosepass can switch into the STAB moves of faster physical attackers that threaten Butterfree such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Aipom.</p>"

Swords Dance allows Beedrill to OHKO Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't such as Seaking, Aipom, and Flaaffy. Hidden Power Bug packs a huge punch when Swarm is active and allows Beedrill to sweep effectively, since it can pick up the 2HKO on Porygon and the OHKO on Anorith. Sludge Bomb makes it difficult for would-be switch-ins like Wartortle, Corsola, and Onix to come in unscathed due to its high chance to poison.

Fire Blast is used as Quilava's preferred STAB move to break through damaged teams without relying as heavily on Blaze or Petaya Berry. Despite the drop in damage output, Flamethrower is a reliable alternative that comes with improved accuracy and more PP. Hidden Power Grass provides coverage versus Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Corsola, Chinchou, Onix, and Rhyhorn. Hidden Power Water hits Ponyta while still threatening Pokemon like Onix and Rhyhorn. Substitute is used for its synergy with the ability Blaze; it also maximizes Toxic damage, and takes advantage of Petaya Berry or Salac Berry. Quilava also tends to force its foes out, which can allow it to set up a Substitute. Toxic threatens special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, and Noctowl, and it can punish Ponyta trying to switch in on Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Quick Attack is a great countermeasure to Substitute + pinch Berry sweepers like Abra and Beedrill as well as against Flail and Reversal users like Doduo and Meditite. 216 Speed EVs allow Quilava to outspeed base 75 Speed Pokemon like Anorith and Doduo, and it can invest its remaining EVs into bulk to guarantee survival against Silk Scarf Ponyta's Quick Attack at 25% HP and a Double Edge from Choice Band Ponyta at Full health. With the added bulk, Quilava can also guarantee that it can still use Substitute after taking Silk Scarf Ponyta's Double Edge at full health. This bulk even allows for Quilava to survive a Double-Edge from Choice Band Ponyta. Petaya Berry turns Quilava into an even scarier special attacker that can OHKO a majority of the tier, and 2HKO special walls like Delcatty, Drowzee, and Noctowl. Salac Berry enables Quilava to threaten a sweep versus faster Pokemon within the tier like Abra, Elekid, Ponyta, and Voltorb. This allows Quilava to function as a late-game sweeper against faster teams.</p> <p>Quilava fits well on balance, offense, and sun teams that benefit from its stellar Special Attack.

While Quilava can threaten Ponyta with Toxic and Hidden Power Water, it may not always get the chance to, so it benefits greatly from defensive Normal-resistant Pokemon and Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Corsola, Lileep, Nosepass, Onix, and Rhyhorn, as they can handle physical attackers like Aipom and Ponyta. Water-types like Corsola, Seaking, and Wartortle can also threaten Quilava, and Hidden Power Grass won't do enough against healthy Water-types with decent Special Defense. This makes Electric-types like Elekid, Flaaffy, and Voltorb a great asset for Quilava to deal with Water-types. Late-game, Quilava can threaten a KO with the assistance of a Petaya Berry. Until that is feasible, Quilava needs the support of a special wall like Delcatty, Gloom, Porygon, or Wartortle for its ability to shrug off most special attacks. Clerics like Flaaffy and Mightyena can allow Quilava to not be as hindered by fear of Thunder Wave, Stun Spore, or Toxic.</p>"

Substitute allows Quilava to safely get itself into Petaya Berry range and blocks potential status from Castform and Drowzee, which may weaken Quilava. Quilava can also safely get into Blaze range with Substitute. Hidden Power Ground is used to threaten a 2HKO against Ponyta and a 3HKO against Tentacool.

Gloom can also use Stun Spore to debilitate faster Pokemon such as Aipom and Volbeat, allowing Quilava to eliminate them safely. Quilava is vulnerable to status from Pokemon such as Drowzee and Porygon, so clerics like Flaaffy and Mightyena are appreciated. Salac Berry sweepers such as Anorith and Beedrill appreciate Quilava being able to weaken physical walls like Koffing and Onix.</p>"

Hidden Power Ghost is used to threaten Shuppet, which would otherwise be a hard wall thanks to its Normal immunity, but leaves Farfetch'd vulnerable to Aron. To remedy this, Farfetch'd can run Hidden Power Fighting to threaten Aron, but this leaves it completely walled by Shuppet.

Double-Edge is Noctowl's main attacking move, dealing decent damage into a majority of the tier. Alternatively, Return can be used if you wish to preserve Noctowl's bulk, though this comes at a cost in power, as Noctowl cannot 2HKO Pokemon like Seaking. Hidden Power Grass threatens Normal-resistant Pokemon in Corsola and Rhyhorn with a 2HKO and an OHKO, respectively. Psychic threatens the physically bulky Koffing. Reflect can be used to support Noctowl's teammates, such as Beedrill, into Pokemon such as Aipom. Toxic allows Noctowl to threaten physical walls it cannot hit with its coverage such as Lileep. Protect allows Noctowl to gain extra passive recovery from Leftovers, scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Doduo, and stall out rain or sun turns when facing Pokemon such as Seaking and Ponyta. 128 Defense EVs allow Noctowl to live a variety of physical hits from Pokemon such as Choice Band Aipom, while 128 Speed EVs allow Noctowl to outspeed Pokemon such as Flaaffy and Magnemite.</p> <p>Noctowl fits best on balance and hyper offense teams that appreciate Noctowl's great matchup into other hyper offense teams thanks to its ability to handle Pokemon such as Abra and Quilava while exerting a decent offensive presence. Some partners that appreciate Noctowl's presence include Corsola and Flaaffy, as Noctowl can handle Grass- and Water-types such as Sunny Day Gloom, Rain Dance Seaking, and Lombre.

Reflect additionally helps Calm Mind Drowzee set up, especially versus Pokemon such as Choice Band Doduo. Ponyta also likes Noctowl's favorable matchups into Corsola and Seaking, which sets up rain on Ponyta. Noctowl appreciates Pokemon such as Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Sunflora that cover its weakness into Electric-types. Chinchou and Flaaffy are especially notable because the former resists Ice-type moves, which Noctowl is threatened by, and the latter can be a cleric.

Sludge Bomb hits most Pokemon hard with neutral damage, and Poison-resistant Pokemon such as Rhyhorn and Onix dislike being poisoned by it. Toxic threatens bulky Pokemon such as Castform and Noctowl that hate status on the switch in. Baton Pass allows frail offensive Pokemon such as Meditite, Abra, and Elekid to find entry more commonly due to Ariados's low Speed. Protect gives Ariados extra Leftovers recovery and allows it to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Aipom and Meditite. Alternatively, Signal Beam pressures Mightyena more immediately. Giga Drain threatens Rock-types such as Rhyhorn, Corsola, and Onix on the switch in while also giving Ariados some recovery. A Relaxed nature makes Ariados more offensively threatening as a mixed attacker, while 20 Speed IVs are used in order to underspeed Pokemon like Koffing, keeping frail teammates like Abra safer. Ariados can also lower its Speed IVs to 0 to pivot more slowly than opposing pivot Ariados or at least Speed tie with them.</p> <p>Ariados's flexibility allows it to fit on offense and balance teams alike, as both playstyles appreciate a slow pivot to support Pokemon that struggle to find entry.

With two Calm Mind boosts, Corsola can reliably avoid being 2HKOed by its most common offensive checks, Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Quilava, notably also surviving super effective hits like Hidden Power Grass. Recover provides Corsola with a reliable form of recovery, which helps increase the number of setup opportunities available. Refresh prevents it from being forced out by status users such as Porygon, Koffing, and Castform, drastically increasing its setup opportunities and allowing for almost riskless Calm Mind uses.

Special walls like Porygon, Drowzee, and Delcatty pair well with Corsola, as they can wall Flaaffy and Quilava. Drowzee is worth mentioning because Corsola can absorb status for it, while Drowzee can pass a Wish to Corsola if it gets too weakened to use Recover. Corsola pairs well with physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Seaking, Volbeat, and Doduo, as they can remove Gloom and other specially defensive checks. Because Corsola can find multiple setup opportunities throughout a game, secondary sweepers and cleaners like Anorith and Beedrill make good teammates. Corsola can wall faster revenge killers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Volbeat or set up mid-game and remove potential checks to Beedrill and Anorith.</p>"

Ice Beam also allows Masquerain to focus its efforts on wallbreaking rather than relying on Agility to clean. Intimidate allows Masquerain to pivot in on weaker physical attackers, such as Koffing, or attackers that lack strong coverage, such as Shuppet.

It's also a more reliable check to Koffing, which helps prevent Masquerain from being statused. If Masquerain lacks Ice Beam, Pokemon that can threaten Grass-types such as Growlithe, Pidgeotto, and Seaking are appreciated.</p>"

Moreover, due to an overall lack of Bug-resistant Pokemon, Volbeat cements itself as an excellent wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Signal Beam allows Volbeat to 2HKO stallbreaker Mightyena and 3HKO defensive Mightyena at -1 Attack. With Swarm active, Volbeat has a chance to OHKO a majority of non-Bug-resistant foes, such as Seaking, Anorith, and Flaaffy. Brick Break threatens both Rhyhorn and Onix, which take on non-Swarm Signal Beam. Quick Attack provides Volbeat with a valuable form of speed control, allowing it to revenge kill common pinch Berry users such as Abra, Beedrill, and Quilava. Double-Edge provides Volbeat with a nice midground for bulky Poison-types such as Koffing and Ariados, which otherwise come in for free. Alternatively, Trick can be used to disrupt and cripple physical walls like Gloom and Corsola, as well as special wallbreakers like Flaaffy, Seaking, and Clamperl.</p> <p>Volbeat fits best on balanced and bulky offensive teams that struggle to reliably remove Salac Berry users like Anorith and Beedrill. Strong physical attackers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Ponyta can overload Volbeat's defensive checks such as Tropius, Ariados, and Koffing. Conversely, Volbeat can neuter these defensive checks with Trick, allowing the aforementioned physical attackers more consistency when wallbreaking. Doduo and Ponyta are exceptionally good at this because of their Flying- and Fire-type STAB attacks. Moreover, both have access to Quick Attack, allowing them to revenge kill for each other, as well as significantly reducing the potency of Salac Berry sweepers. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Onix, Koffing, and Corsola can wall physical attackers that Volbeat cannot OHKO without Swarm active, such as Aipom, Castform, and Seaking. Onix is worth a special mention, as its access to Explosion allows it to soften or remove bulkier foes and provide momentum, which can help open up a late-game scenario where Volbeat can clean. Volbeat is incredibly vulnerable to status, so Pokemon with Heal Bell, such as Mightyena, Flaaffy, and Delcatty, make for good teammates. Volbeat struggles with physical walls and priority users, so Pokemon like Gloom and Onix can help remedy this.</p>"

Return deals decent damage to the majority of the tier. Alternatively, Double-Edge can be used in order to threaten physical walls such as Koffing for more damage at the cost of recoil, which can put Castform in range of being KOed by Pokemon such as Choice Band Aipom. Hidden Power Grass covers Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Corsola and Rhyhorn, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. Toxic lets Castform threaten general physical walls such as Tropius and Lileep. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon such as Aipom and Gloom, making Castform a decent bulky paralysis user. Protect gives Castform a way of scouting Choice Band Pokemon such as Aipom and stalling weather turns. Castform also greatly benefits from the extra passive recovery from Leftovers that using Protect provides. Castform's EV spread allows it to survive a variety of Pokemon such as an OHKO from Choice Band Aipom, a 2HKO from Silk Scarf Ponyta and a 2HKO from Seaking under rain.

Fast Pokemon such as Ponyta and Abra appreciate Castform spreading paralysis to make them much harder to revenge kill. Castform's Toxic wears down walls such as Tropius that otherwise wall physical wallbreakers such as Aipom. Castform itself does not appreciate taking status, so Heal Bell users such as Flaaffy and Mightyena make great partners. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Quilava appreciate Castform's ability to check Rain Dance Seaking, which can take advantage of them to set up. Other setup sweepers such as Beedrill appreciate Castform checking priority users such as Ponyta. While Castform is quite bulky, some physical wallbreakers like Doduo and Meditite can threaten to OHKO it.

Stun Spore provides Gloom and its team speed control, which can make common threats like Ponyta, Aipom, and Beedrill much more manageable and also enable slower partners like Clamperl to outspeed and OHKO foes.

Heal Bell on Mightyena is a great option that can patch up a statused Gloom. Heal Bell Flaaffy is an alternative cleric that can allow Gloom to stay in on more threats like opposing Fire Punch Flaaffy without fear of permanent burn. Gloom’s reluctance to stay in versus Quilava makes bulky Water-types such as Corsola, Seaking, and Wartortle as well as Flash Fire Ponyta strong pairings alongside Gloom. Corsola is another excellent defensive ally that fits nicely on Gloom teams, since the two cover up each other’s weaknesses with their typings. Corsola can be especially useful for helping Gloom switch out from strong Choice Band users like Aipom, Ponyta, and Doduo. Ponyta and Quilava both appreciate a strong switch-in against Water-types like Corsola and Seaking and thus pair nicely alongside Gloom. Stun Spore is an excellent way to enable slower offensive attackers like Clamperl, Cubone, and Rhyhorn. Poison-types like Koffing, Dustox, Ariados, and Beedrill can wall Gloom, especially when it's not running Leech Seed. This makes heavy hitters like Abra and Anorith great teammates to break walls that otherwise slowly deal with Gloom one-on-one. Other physical walls like Flamethrower Koffing can also be great partners to help Gloom better manage Poison-type and Bug-type threats alike. Swords Dance Tropius is another great option that can help manage Pokemon that resist Gloom's attacks, but it can expose the team with a greater Fire weakness. Specially defensive Gloom can unfortunately be exploited as setup fodder in the face of Anorith, Beedrill, and Abra. This makes priority attackers like Ponyta, Volbeat, Doduo, and Meditite great teammates that can alleviate this weakness. Gloom’s weakness to Noctowl offers another reason why certain physical attackers pair nicely with it, like Anorith and Rhyhorn.</p>"

In sun, Solar Beam can even 2HKO some foes that resist Grass such as Ponyta and Quilava. Hidden Power Fire hits Grass-types such as Tropius and opposing Gloom as well as Magnemite. It also threatens certain Poison-types such as Koffing, Ariados, and Beedrill. Synthesis provides Gloom with recovery to help it remain healthy while it trades blows with foes such as opposing Gloom and Koffing. The given EV spread maximizes Gloom's Special Attack while allowing it to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Elekid, while in sun. The longevity provided by Leftovers can be eschewed in favor of Lum Berry preventing a foe such as Porygon from paralyzing Gloom once.</p> <p>Gloom best fits on offense teams looking for a potent sun sweeper, being mandatory on dedicated sun teams and excellent on semi-sun teams. Gloom and other Chlorophyll sweepers such as Tropius and Exeggcute are able to weaken and remove each other's shared checks. Sun setters, such as Ponyta, can help Gloom by setting up sun and luring in Pokemon it checks such as Corsola and Clamperl. Gloom is notably very effective at removing Water-types such as Corsola, making it a natural teammate for Pokemon such as Aipom, Doduo, and Ponyta. Gloom struggles with Fire-types such as Ponyta and Quilava; while sun is active, Gloom can deal heavy damage to them with Solar Beam, but is usually OHKOed back; outside of sun, Gloom is completely helpless. Checks to them such as Flash Fire Ponyta and Chinchou make for great partners as a result. While it also hates taking Fire-type moves, Tropius can take advantage of Gloom's sun with Chlorophyll and, depending on its Attack investment, even OHKO most Fire-types with Earthquake. Offensive variants of Tropius can serve as potent checks to Gloom, outspeeding it even in sun and 2HKOing it with Hidden Power Flying or Fire, making checks to it such as Porygon good partners. Castform is a danger to most sun teams due to its good bulk and ability turning it into a Fire-type while in sun, making checks to it such as wallbreakers in Aipom and Doduo and bulky Pokemon in Noctowl and Koffing good teammates. There are a few special walls such as Porygon and Noctowl that can wall Gloom, making it appreciate support from strong physical wallbreakers such as Aipom and Doduo.</p>"

Gloom can almost never break Koffing on its own, so it appreciates partners that can handle Koffing, such as Seaking, Corsola, and defensive Noctowl. Fast cleaners like Abra, Quilava, and Volbeat greatly benefit from Gloom breaking holes in teams so they can more easily finish off weakened targets. Psychic-type moves from Pokemon like Abra, Drowzee, and Smoochum chew through Gloom, so Mightyena and Magnemite are helpful to mitigate these threats. Fast Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava are a threat to Gloom, and teammates like Wartortle, Castform, and Lileep manage these foes for it. Gloom struggles to prevent Beedrill from setting up freely on it, so it benefits from partnering with Quick Attack users like Ponyta, Quilava, and Doduo to prevent Beedrill from sweeping. Flaaffy threatens to 2HKO Gloom with Fire Punch, so partners that check it, such as Chinchou, Dustox, and Delcatty, are all helpful.</p>"

Lileep finds itself as the physically defensive backbone on a plethora of different teams, and this allows Mankey to standout because of its adeptness at threatening it with Cross Chop. Earthquake provides Mankey with a more accurate option against Fire-types like Growlithe and Cyndaquil and Electric-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Elekid. Mankey is able to outspeed the previous two and is able to avoid being OHKOed by Elekid's Thunderbolt while at full health. Rock Slide threatens Dustox and Flying-types like Pidgeotto, Tailow, and Delibird that may try to switch in on an Earthquake. Because of the sheer amount of switches Mankey forces, Focus Punch is a viable option, allowing it to heavily damage or OHKO would be switch-ins like Bayleef. Vital Spirit provides Mankey with an opportunity to switch into Butterfree on a Sleep Powder; however, Mankey Speed ties with maximum Speed Butterfree and gets OHKOed by Psychic if it loses the tie.</p> <p>Mankey excels on balance and offense teams that need a dedicated offensive Lileep check.

Utility Aipom appreciates how much Mankey threatens Lileep, which it otherwise struggles to remove due to its lack of Choice Band. Additionally, Nosepass also makes for a great partner, as its excellent bulk makes it an excellent pivot for Mankey into faster attackers like Pidgeotto.

        "description": "<p>Abra is a huge threat with its combination of Speed and Special Attack. It outspeeds and can revenge kill many weakened foes like Quilava, Aipom, Flaaffy, and Seaking. Calm Mind makes Abra an even stronger attacker and allows it to 2HKO even special walls like Porygon and Delcatty with Psychic after a single boost. Encore disrupts setup sweepers like Anorith and Beedrill as well as defensive threats like Wartortle and Delcatty by locking them into an unthreatening move. This offers Abra more setup opportunities and can make up for its poor defenses. Substitute pairs well with Petaya Berry to ensure it can be activated and is a safer way to boost Abra's offensive power without risking an OHKO. STAB Psychic threatens a 2HKO on many common foes such as Flaaffy and Seaking, making Abra very difficult to switch into and very powerful as a revenge attacker. Hidden Power Grass threatens mainly Corsola with the potential to OHKO it without a boost but can also serve to hit Water-types really hard and KO them with additional damage. Ice Punch threatens Tropius with 4x super effective damage and can also be an option over Hidden Power Grass to hit Mightyena and Lileep slightly harder. Petaya Berry coupled with Abra’s Special Attack allows it to swiftly clean up chipped teams, even 2HKOing special walls like Delcatty and Porygon with a +1 Psychic. Lum Berry is a great alternative to absorb and return status to preserve when Abra can be a threat without the additional power from Petaya. Lum Berry is ideal when running Encore + Calm Mind and no substitute. A Timid nature is recommended to outspeed the entirety of the tier outside of Voltorb and Elekid as well as Ponyta, which Abra Speed ties with.</p> <p>Abra fits both on offensive and defensive teams as a late-game sweeper and constant disruptor with the threat of Encore. Abra is at its strongest when it’s preserved to clean up late-game after its checks are dealt with or in a health range that allows Abra to KO them. This makes defensive pivots critical on any team with Abra to cover a number of common threats. Koffing can take on common physical attackers like Ponyta, Beedrill, Anorith and common Choice Band users like Meditite, Doduo, Seaking, and Aipom when they’re locked into a resisted move. Intimidate Mightyena and Normal-resistant Pokemon like Corsola, Rhyhorn, and Anorith can come in on Quick Attack users as well as opposing Abra and also do respectable damage to special walls that can get in Abra's way. Abra benefits greatly from a safe switch in due to its fragility, which makes strong Baton Pass users such as Ariados, Meditite, and Delcatty great pairings. Ariados can come in on Mightyena and threaten it out with a strong STAB Signal Beam while also taking on other threats with good coverage in Sludge Bomb and Psychic for Koffing and Beedrill. Abra’s extremely poor bulk makes it an easy target for priority users, notably Doduo, Ponyta, and Meditite. Specially defensive pivots are required alongside Abra to counteract opposing special walls that are not yet in range of a KO. Ariados can serve as a strong Mightyena switch-in and additionally functions as a slow pivot via Baton Pass. Delcatty can serve as a special wall and cleric support for Abra and other offensive threats on the team. Specially defensive Gloom and Noctowl can be great alternative options. Gloom can come in on many threats like Corsola and Mightyena and force progress with Stun Spore or Leech Seed. Noctowl can slowly wear down Pokemon that Abra doesn’t threaten like Mightyena or Drowzee. Abra enjoys being paired with additional sweepers that can enable its sweep. Options like Anorith can break through special walls like Noctowl, Delcatty and Porygon that can get in Abra's way. Weather sweepers like Seaking and Tropius can also open up Abra's offensive gameplan by putting opposing teams in KO range of its attacks. Choice Band wallbreakers like Ponyta and Mightyena can offer much of the same by damaging foes that tend to slow down Abra.</p>"

Double-Edge is Ponyta's strongest option due to the lack of offensive Normal-resistant Pokemon. Ponyta tends to get worn down fairly quickly while using Double-Edge; Return is a viable option over Double-Edge to prevent this. The only downside is a 15% decrease in power, making it more difficult for Ponyta to threaten foes it soft checks like Castform, Tentacool, and Chinchou. Fire Blast threatens physically bulkier foes like Tropius, Gloom, and Magnemite. Hidden Power Grass threatens Corsola with a 2HKO, preventing it from switching in safely. Hidden Power Ground can be used for a better matchup against Fire-types such as opposing Ponyta, Quilava, and Magby. Quick Attack provides Ponyta with a valuable form of speed control, allowing it to revenge kill common pinch Berry users like Abra, Quilava, and Beedrill. Choice Band can be used over Silk Scarf to guarantee the Quick Attack KO on Salac Berry Beedrill and Quilava after activating their Berry. Choice Band also allows Ponyta to OHKO Quilava and opposing Ponyta with Hidden Power Ground. Due to Double-Edge being generally riskless, using Leftovers is a viable option to help mitigate the recoil.

Physically defensive Pokemon such as Corsola, Tropius, Gloom, and Koffing appreciate Ponyta checking physical wallbreakers Aipom, Volbeat, and Doduo. Corsola is worth a special mention, as Ponyta can threaten Gloom for it. In return, Corsola can set up on common Ponyta checks like Porygon, Castform, Wartortle, and bulky Mightyena. In that same vein, special walls like Drowzee, Gloom, Porygon, and Delcatty appreciate how Ponyta can check Aipom, Volbeat, and Doduo. Special attackers such as Clamperl, Flaaffy, Quilava, and Abra appreciate Ponyta weakening special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, Gloom, and Delcatty. Flaaffy can check Corsola for Ponyta, allowing it the freedom to use Hidden Power Ground. In return, Ponyta checks Quilava, which OHKOes Flaaffy with Overheat.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ponyta's excellent Speed tier and strong special moves allow it to shine as the premier Sunny Day user. Besides supporting its teammates, Sunny Day allows Ponyta to weaken incoming Water-types that may attempt to check it, such as Corsola, Wartortle, and Seaking. Fire Blast, while threatening on its own, becomes incredibly hard to withstand while boosted by sun. Solar Beam allows Ponyta to threaten the previously mentioned Water-types and Rock-types. It's important to note that Ponyta has a chance to OHKO bulky Wartortle with Solar Beam if it first switches into a Fire Blast. Hidden Power Ground allows Ponyta to threaten Fire-types such as Quilava, Ponyta, and Magby. Quick Attack may also be used as a safety net against Salac Berry users. It is recommended to not run maximum Speed on Chlorophyll teammates. Toxic weakens potential switch-ins early in the game before using Sunny Day later. Lum Berry allows Ponyta to disregard status users such as Porygon, Magnemite, and Gloom, resulting in more opportunities to use Sunny Day. Charcoal increases the potency of Fire Blast, and it most notably decreases the chip damage needed to KO Gloom and Tropius with Fire Blast outside of sun. It also secures the Fire Blast 2HKO on Porygon while sun is active. Run Away is used instead of Flash Fire so that Ponyta can reliably damage Porygon if it attempts to switch in.</p> <p>Ponyta fits almost exclusively on teams that center around the usage of Sunny Day. Moreover, its viability as a Sunny Day user allows it to function on semi-sun teams as well. Chlorophyll users like Gloom, Tropius, Sunflora, and Nuzleaf all benefit from Ponyta as a Sunny Day user. These Chlorophyll users can set Sunny Day on their own as well, which prevents Ponyta from needing to come in multiple times to use it. Tropius is worth mentioning, as Ponyta can weaken or remove physical walls that may prevent Tropius from sweeping. Ponyta appreciates physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Seaking, Volbeat, and Doduo to weaken or remove special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, and Tentacool. On semi-sun teams, if Ponyta chooses to use Charcoal, then a Heal Bell user such as Flaaffy or Mightyena is beneficial. Flaaffy is worth noting, as it forms a potent special attacking core with Ponyta. Flaaffy also benefits from Sunny Day, as it can OHKO Volbeat and reliably 2HKO specially defensive Gloom with Fire Punch in sun.</p>"

Using Substitute allows Magnemite to rack up more Toxic damage while also letting it go for a paralysis if using Thunder Wave. Toxic helps break through walls like Porygon and Drowzee and is Magnemite's only good option against Chinchou. Thunder Wave hinders faster foes like Aipom and Volbeat and punishes Toxic-immune Pokemon like Gloom and Dustox. The Speed investment allows Magnemite to outspeed maximum Speed Cubone and Clamperl as well as defensive Noctowl sets, allowing Magnemite secure a 3HKO against it.

Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava appreciate Magnemite removing Water-types like Clamperl and Wartortle with ease. Faster foes that run Hidden Power Ground such as Doduo are an issue for Magnemite, since they easily OHKO it. Physical walls like Koffing and Lileep can switch in on these threats and threaten them back. Cubone is bulky enough to survive Hidden Power Water, and it can retaliate with a powerful Ground-type attack. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Koffing and Tropius are helpful because they gladly switch into Ground-type attacks. Fire-types like Ponyta can also easily blow through Magnemite, so Water-types like Wartortle and special walls like Porygon can help by safely switching in on a Fire Blast. Bulky Electric-immune or -resistant Pokemon like Chinchou, Flaaffy, and Gloom can be difficult for Magnemite to handle because they exert enough pressure to outlast Toxic or are just immune to its moves. Powerful wallbreakers like Aipom can help KO or significantly chunk these threats. Magnemite is able to use its defensive typing to assist allies that struggle with Pokemon such as Beedrill and Porygon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Salac Berry set with Flail and either Substitute or Endure can turn Doduo into a setup sweeper, but Doduo's bad defensive profile makes it an inconsistent sweeper, and ADV ZU has a plethora of Quick Attack users between Ponyta, Quilava, and opposing Doduo. Hidden Power Fighting covers Corsola, Mightyena, and Magnemite in one slot but makes Doduo's Speed IV a point lower, causing it to lose instead of speed Speed tie against opposing Doduo, Beedrill, and Anorith.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Corsola can switch into Doduo and can heal off any damage with Recover, while Doduo needs chip damage to 2HKO Corsola with Hidden Power Ground as it switches in. Tropius and Lileep can withstand attacks other than Drill Peck and force Doduo to wear itself down with Double-Edge recoil. Mightyena's Intimidate makes Doduo easier for it and its teammates to handle. Koffing and Wartortle can withstand a Double-Edge and potentially KO Doduo once it's chipped enough.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava outspeed and easily OHKO Doduo or force it out due to its frailty. Abra OHKOes Doduo but must be wary of Quick Attack as do other weakened or frail faster attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Voltorb. Ponyta and Quilava themselves can use Quick Attack to outprioritize Doduo.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Doduo's low HP stat and recoil from Double-Edge quickly wear it down and can potentially KO it. The turn-ending effect of Doduo KOing itself can be used to deny recovery to defensive Pokemon like Corsola, Gloom, and Lileep in order to set up a teammate to finish them off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Doduo is frail and easily worn down by the recoil from Double-Edge, so it does not want to risk even switching into Toxic from passive targets like Mightyena, Porygon, and Noctowl. A burn from Koffing's Will-O-Wisp will neutralize Doduo. Paralysis from Thunder Wave from Porygon and Castform as well as Flaaffy's Static is debilitating to Doduo given its frailty and reliance on its Speed to avoid being KOed itself.</p>",

Many Pokemon slower than Doduo like Seaking, Clamperl, and Meditite are OHKOed by Double-Edge. Certain physical walls like Koffing and Tropius cannot reliably switch into Doduo, while Mightyena and Wartortle are worn down switching into repeated attacks. Quick Attack compensates for Doduo's good but not amazing Speed and picks off weakened offensive Pokemon like Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava, notably OHKOing Abra. Quick Attack is useful to finish off weakened Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Tropius, Gloom, Beedrill, and Ariados. Drill Peck deals over 80% damage to physically defensive Gloom, reliably 2HKOes physically defensive Tropius, and lacks the recoil damage of Double-Edge. Hidden Power Ground is Doduo's best coverage move for the few relevant physically bulky Pokemon that resist Normal in the tier, enabling it to 2HKO Corsola with some chip damage, OHKO Magnemite, and 2HKO Rhyhorn.</p> <p>Doduo is a good fit on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate both wallbreaking and revenge killing. Aipom is Doduo's most significant competition thanks to its greater bulk, Speed, and coverage, although Doduo's greater power and Quick Attack distinguish it from Aipom. Doduo threatening specially bulky Pokemon like Porygon, Noctowl, and Delcatty is appreciated by special attackers like Sunny Day Gloom, Abra, and Quilava, which return the favor to Doduo by beating physical walls like Corsola, Koffing, and Magnemite. Doduo's frailty leaves it unable to deal with Pokemon it invites in like Corsola, Mightyena, and Lileep, so it depends on defensive partners like Gloom, Corsola, and Koffing to compensate for its lacking defensive value. Doduo's frailty leaves it quickly worn down when using Double-Edge and rarely able to switch in for free, so partners using Baton Pass like Delcatty can bring Doduo in safely. Toxic users like Ponyta, Mightyena, and Porygon support Doduo by chipping down foes, wearing down Heal Bell Mightyena, and luring in Delcatty for Doduo to dispatch. Pokemon like Gloom, Koffing, and Corsola struggle against late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Abra, Ponyta, Quilava, and Sunny Day Gloom and Tropius, so Doduo's strong Quick Attack is much appreciated.</p>"

Grimer is incapable of making any meaningful progress against Magnemite, Rhyhorn, and Aron, and thus checks to them are essential for it to function. The former can be handled by special tanks and walls, such as Chinchou or bulky variants of Castform, who have the added benefit of acting as a substitute special wall if Grimer is forced out while asleep. Rhyhorn and Aron, on the other hand, can usually be checked by Water- and Grass-types such as Staryu and Bayleef. Koffing is another notable partner, as while it and Grimer share the same typing, Koffing completely walls Rhyhorn and Aron, neutering 2 of Grimer's worst matchups, while in return, Grimer handles special attackers that give Koffing trouble. Delcatty is another partner that deserves a special mention, as it can use Wish and Heal Bell to keep Grimer healthy, but its cleric sets also struggle to touch the same Pokemon Grimer struggles with. Finally, Rock- and Steel-types such as Lileep and Magnemite make good partners due to their ability to check powerful Normal-type attackers such as Aipom and Taillow, who can usually overwhelm Grimer before it can set up.</p>"

Substitute synergizes with Explosion by letting Onix scout common users of Protect, such as Castform, Noctowl, and Seaking. Onix can use Protect itself over Explosion, enabling it to scout faster Choice Band users like Aipom, Doduo, and Volbeat for their Ground- and Fighting-type coverage moves.

Bonemerang trades some of Earthquake's reliability to break Substitute, strengthening Cubone's matchups against users like Anorith, Beedrill, and Onix. Swords Dance makes Cubone capable of blowing through even physical walls like Koffing and Tropius, and it can use it to take advantage of opponents attempting to switch in a weakened Pokemon as a sack. Double-Edge has effectively perfect coverage with Earthquake, destroying Koffing, Noctowl, and Volbeat. Substitute protects Cubone from Koffing's Will-O-Wisp and Mightyena's Toxic, and these two Pokemon would otherwise be the only Pokemon that can switch in and take a hit after Cubone has used Swords Dance. Similar to Swords Dance, Substitute also capitalizes on the switches Cubone often forces as a wallbreaker. Additionally, Substitute gives Cubone a cushion against revenge killers given its lackluster Speed. Rock Head lets Cubone use Double-Edge without fear of recoil damage. Thick Club is required to power up Cubone's underwhelming Attack stat, and the flexibility to switch moves that it provides differentiates Cubone from Choice Band wallbreakers like Anorith, Volbeat, and Doduo.</p> <p>Cubone fits best on balance and offense teams looking for an especially powerful wallbreaker. Balance teams can compensate for Cubone's defensive shortcomings with bulky partners like Koffing, Tropius, Delcatty, and Noctowl. Delcatty is an especially good supporting partner to Cubone with Wish, Heal Bell, and Baton Pass, and Cubone destroys the Rock-types that Delcatty invites in. Fast offensive Pokemon, including Ponyta, Abra, and Aipom, can more easily clean up teams that Cubone weakens, and they compensate for its underwhelming Speed. Paralysis support from Gloom, Flaaffy, Porygon, and Castform enables Cubone to outspeed and run over paralyzed foes. Baton Pass users like Aipom, Ariados, and Delcatty offer Cubone much safer positioning, and they tend to lure in physical walls and Rock-types for it to threaten. Physical walls like Corsola and Koffing can handle fast Choice Band Normal-types like Aipom and Doduo that would threaten to revenge kill Cubone.</p>"

Rock Blast breaks past Substitute users like Anorith and Beedrill, but Rock Slide's consistent damage and higher accuracy make it more reliable.

In addition, the move lets Rhyhorn maximize its passive recovery from Leftovers. 204 HP and 20 Defense EVs give Rhyhorn enough bulk to generally avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Aipom's Brick Break and survive Swords Dance Anorith's boosted Brick Break. 136 Speed EVs let Rhyhorn outspeed uninvested base 40 Speed Pokemon like Gloom and Porygon, Corsola, and bulky Clamperl variants.

Specially bulky Pokemon like Gloom and Porygon can compensate for Rhyhorn's vulnerability to special attackers, and Rhyhorn returns the favor to them by checking physical attackers they would otherwise struggle against. Castform is especially good against weather users like Ponyta, and it manages Hidden Power Grass variants of Ponyta for Rhyhorn too. Ariados handles Gloom, a major threat to Rhyhorn, while Rhyhorn can switch into and pressure Doduo and Anorith for it. Baton Pass Ariados variants further support Rhyhorn, pivoting to it after drawing in vulnerable Rock-types like Onix, weakened Corsola looking to heal up, and Anorith. Fast attackers like Ponyta and Quilava enjoy the holes Rhyhorn opens up in teams relying on bulky Water-types like Seaking and Wartortle, as such holes enable them to more easily clean up. Additionally, both of these Fire-types offensively threaten Grass-types like Tropius and Gloom for Rhyhorn. Rhyhorn is vulnerable to Water-types and Water-type moves given its 4x weakness and poor special bulk, so Seaking, Gloom, and Chinchou pair very well with it. Koffing hard walls Rhyhorn, which can be mitigated by partners like defensive Ariados, Seaking, and Wartortle.</p>"

Any other variant of Calm Mind is mostly outclassed by Spoink, which has much better defensive use and a wider movepool. Wish can be used as a foe is switching out to recover health on Natu or a teammate, but Natu's poor defenses make this a risky option to use. Night Shade can deal damage for very percentages of health in the very low HP stat metagame of ZU. But Natu's main STAB attack, Psychic, has good neutral coverage and power already and many of its checks don't even resist it, although Night Shade does hit Steel-types harder. Baton Pass could be used to generate momentum for powerful wallbreakers as foes switch out, but this would force it to drop Substitute.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types have the bulk and resistance to take Psychic while also being immune to Toxic. Magnemite and Aron can comfortably take any move Natu commonly uses and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Natu's Speed tier is quite good, but it's not elite.

        "description": "<p>Despite seemingly being outclassed due to Spoink's superior base stats and defensive utility, Natu has some key traits that allow it to carve out a niche as a Substitute and Toxic user. Psychic is a solid STAB-type with few checks in the tier. Notably, a super effective hit on Poison-types like Dustox and Grimer narrows the pool of Pokemon that can check Natu. Thanks to Natu's solid base 70 Speed, it can use Substitute in front of Pokemon that could tank a Psychic such as Spoink and Chinchou, while at minimum Speed tying Castform, which regularly does not fully invest in Speed. Toxic racks up damage on the many special tank checks to Natu like Castform and Lileep, particularly synergizing with Substitute due to the free turns it provides. Protect primarily allows Natu to stall more turns while the opponent is badly poisoned, but the extra turns of recovery from Leftovers and scouting it provides are appreciated as well. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative that allows Natu to immediately KO even specially defensive variants of Rhyhorn and pressure defensive Staryu without expending Psychic PP, although it becomes easier to force Natu out when it can't Protect to force additional Toxic damage. Maximum Speed and a Timid nature are used so that Natu can confidently outspeed Pokemon like Seaking, Chinchou, and Cyndaquil. 12 EVs HP are used to maximize Leftovers recovery, while the rest are dedicated to Special Attack. Both of Natu's abilities can be useful; Early Bird allows Natu to switch directly into Butterfree's Sleep Powder and wake up relatively quickly, while Synchronize can punish the very common Thunder Wave, Will-O Wisp, and Toxic at the cost of crippling Natu.</p> <p>Natu should be used on balance and offense teams which can take advantage of the pressure it applies, and Pokemon that serve as reliable switch-ins to faster attackers that threaten to OHKO Natu are ideal teammates. Spikes have excellent synergy with Natu, as the damage dealt to foes switching in combined with Toxic's increasing damage makes it very difficult to answer. Snorunt stands out as a Spiker with a strong offensive profile, although Pineco's Explosion can also get the ball rolling for Natu. Elekid sits in a nearly uncontested Speed tier, allowing it to clean up teams Natu has weakened and revenge kill targets like Pidgeotto and chipped Aipom. Swift Swim attackers like Horsea are similarly effective, running through teams once roadblocks like Chinchou and Bayleef have been put into KO range. Natu isn't powerful enough that it can threaten immediate KOs for offense teams, so other Pokemon that can such as Wailmer, Choice Band Aipom, and Seaking are great partners. Natu provides very little defensive utility, so it requires partners that can swap into attacks directed at it. Magnemite is a great partner, resisting many common Rock- and Normal-type attacks, keeping up offensive pressure, and even potentially trapping the other Steel-types that wall Natu. Koffing is another great pairing thanks to its mix of offense and defense. Its great physical bulk allows it to easily switch into unboosted physical attacks and threaten foes with Will-O-Wisp or its strong attacking movepool.</p>"

Flaaffy has significant competition with Delcatty in this role, though Flaaffy justifies its use with its solid offensive presence, making it effective at taking on some physical walls and Electic-weak foes such as Koffing, Clamperl, and Noctowl. While Flaaffy can be used to defensively check some foes such as Elekid and Koffing, it is quite frail and thus should generally avoid taking hits; as a result, bulky teammates such as Tropius, Mightyena, and Gloom make great partners.

Rhyhorn lacks reliable recovery, but it can easily tank Aipom's STAB moves and threaten it and its team with heavy damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: While they are usually OHKOed back, faster foes such as Abra and Ponyta can easily revenge kill Aipom after it has taken the smallest amount of chip damage. Weather sweepers, such as Gloom, can easily OHKO Aipom when their favored weather is active, though they usually take heavy damage or are OHKOed outright by Aipom's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Shuppet</strong>: Since Aipom usually only runs Normal- and Fighting-type attacking moves, it cannot damage Shuppet at all.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: With its resistance to Normal, Magnemite can tank Aipom's STAB moves and threaten it and its team with heavy damage and status, though it cannot switch into even resisted Choice Band-boosted Normal-type attacks and must be wary of Aipom's Fighting-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Tropius</strong>: Offensive variants of Tropius can easily tank even a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge and threaten heavy damage in return, notably with Tropius able to set up sun to outspeed Aipom next turn. Defensive variants of Tropius are bulky enough to not even be 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge, letting it wall Aipom.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Being burned completely ruins Aipom, preventing it from meaningfully damaging most foes. Paralysis is similar, making Aipom easy to KO due to its frailty. While Toxic doesn't immediately stop Aipom, it tends to be worn down very quickly by poison damage and Double-Edge recoil.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Aipom's high Speed and Attack make it a potent wallbreaker with Choice Band and Double-Edge. Brick Break targets Rock-types such as Corsola and Rhyhorn, as well as hitting Magnemite. Baton Pass lets Aipom pivot out, easing prediction against foes likely to switch out against it. Return provides a powerful hit without costing Aipom's HP, but its lower power matters in some matchups, such as it failing to 2HKO physically bulky variants of Gloom and Koffing. Both of Aipom's abilities are useless; it does not matter which is chosen.</p> <p>Aipom best fits on offensive and balance teams looking for a potent wallbreaker, something helped by the lack of viable Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves. The ability to remove physical and special walls and tanks such as Koffing, Noctowl, and Flaaffy makes it a great partner for offensive teammates such as Elekid, Ponyta, and Gloom. Calm Mind Corsola is Aipom's hardest counter, taking minimal damage from Double-Edge and failing to be 2HKOed by Brick Break. Grass-types such as Tropius and Gloom can break through Corsola before it accumulates too many boosts, though they must watch out for Ice Beam. Powerful wallbreakers such as Clamperl and Cubone can break through Aipom's defensive checks like Corsola, Rhyhorn, and Lileep, while it in return provides them with the means to switch in with Baton Pass. Toxic users such as Porygon can also cripple these foes, limiting their ability to check Aipom. Aipom struggles with faster Pokemon such as Ponyta and Abra, making bulky Pokemon such as Mightyena and Tropius good teammates. Choice Band Aipom can be used as a lead, providing instant power against opposing leads and the ability to pivot out of bad matchups and predicted switches using Baton Pass.</p>"

Brick Break lacks Double-Edge's recoil as a coverage move for Pokemon that resist Normal like Lileep, Magnemite, and Rhyhorn, though Double-Edge is still stronger against most of them, including Anorith. Return trades Double-Edge's recoil drawback for lower power, though this is helpful to Aipom given its lack of defensive utility and longevity. Focus Punch can catch Corsola and other Pokemon weak to Fighting like Mightyena and Lileep trying to switch into Aipom, dealing way more damage than Double-Edge or Brick Break despite the riskiness of using it. Baton Pass enables Aipom to be an offensive pivot, taking advantage of switch-ins to switch to an appropriate teammate and letting Aipom escape bad matchups against defensive Pokemon such as Corsola. A Silk Scarf maximizes the power of Aipom's STAB moves and lacks the drawbacks of locking in that Choice Band inflicts.</p> <p>All-out Attacker Aipom fits more offensive teams as a cleaner thanks to its high Speed, and its utility as a revenge killer is also appreciated by bulkier teams. Wallbreakers like Seaking, Quilava, and Ponyta can soften up teams for Aipom to clean up while checking opposing Ponyta. Choice Band wallbreakers such as Doduo, Volbeat, and Meditite can respectively break down physically defensive Pokemon such as Koffing, Mightyena, and Corsola for Aipom. Pokemon that can check or counter Koffing such as Tentacool, Drowzee, and Dustox are helpful teammates for Aipom due to it struggling to overcome Koffing on its own. Physically defensive Gloom and Tropius are a pain for Aipom to break without support, so it appreciates help from partners like Koffing and Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava to neutralize them. Aipom appreciates bulkier partners that can check the few Pokemon faster than it; Castform and Wartortle can handle Ponyta, Mightyena and Porygon check Abra, and Chinchou and Delcatty answer Elekid. Aipom especially struggles to break Corsola, so it appreciates checks to it such as Flaaffy and Gloom. Other Baton Pass users such as Ariados and Delcatty synergize with Aipom by creating pivot cores and allowing it to come in more safely.</p>"

Sunny Day ensures Sunflora will get the Speed boost it needs. Solar Beam is extremely powerful and is Sunflora's strongest STAB attack, and it can be used with little-to-no drawbacks while sun is active. Hidden Power Fire prevents Pokemon such as Bayleef, other Sunflora, or Magnemite from walling Sunflora. It's also boosted by Sunny Day allowing Sunflora to almost always 2HKO Dustox. Synthesis provides Sunflora with a reliable form of recovery that gets a boost when sun is active. Lum Berry allows Sunflora a free turn to use Sunny Day against status users like Dustox and Magnemite while also allowing preventing it from being crippled as a cleaner. Its HP investment gets higher Leftovers recovery without hindering its Speed significantly. A Modest nature provides Sunflora with extra power while still outspeeding fully-investedfoes with base 85 speed like Staryu and Aipom while Sunny Day is active.</p> <p>Sunflora fits best on sun teams. It can also be used on balance teams as a late-game cleaner or mid-game wallbreaker. On teams that take advantage of sun, Sunflora appreciates other Sunny Day users such as Onix and Castform, which can help prevent Sunflora from taking a hit to set sun. Other Chlorphyll users such as Exeggcute and Nuzleaf can benefit from Sunflora's usage of Sunny Day. Likewise, they can also damage would-be checks so that Sunflora can remove them later. On balance teams Sunflora appreciates physical wallbreakers such as Aipom, Cubone, and Nidorino to weaken or remove specially defensive walls such as Delcatty and Castform that stand in the way of Sunflora cleaning. These same physical wallbreakers also appreciate Sunflora as a midgame wallbreaker that can threaten their checks such as Koffing, Rhyhorn, and Nosepass. Sunflora is still outsped by Elekid even with Sunny Day active, so Pokemon that can check it such as Castform, Nosepass, and Dustox pair well with Sunflora. Fire-types such Cyndaquil and Growlithe pair well with Sunflora due to making excellent secondary special wallbreakers while Sunny Day is active. These Fire-types can also prove to be quite difficult for Sunflora to deal with, so Pokemon such as Nosepass and Chinchou make good partners.</p>"

Razor Leaf lets Sunflora avoid becoming setup fodder against Pokemon like Spoink thanks to its raised critical hit chance. Giga Drain can be run as another bonus recovery option, although Razor Leaf has significantly higher PP. Hidden Power Ice allows Sunflora to threaten other Grass-types such as Lileep, Bayleef, and Exeggcute while also threatening Pidgeotto and Taillow.

Additionally, Delibird benefits from the ability to switch moves against Flying-resistant foes like Rhyhorn and Magnemite. Quick Attack picks off frail fast attackers like Abra and Salac Berry users like Beedrill. However, Delibird struggles to fit it over any of its coverage moves without becoming less effective as a wallbreaker, and the accuracy nerf applied by Hustle can lead Delibird to totally flop when trying to finish off dangerous foes like Ponyta and Elekid. Focus Punch can deal a huge chunk of damage to Corsola as it switches in, but this requires great prediction, usually getting Delibird behind a Substitute, and for the move not to miss because of Hustle. Additionally, giving up Hidden Power Ground or Ice Beam for Focus Punch makes Delibird overly prediction-reliant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Delibird cannot 2HKO Corsola, even with Hidden Power Ground, and Corsola can 2HKO Delibird or just use it as setup fodder. Clamperl and Seaking are generally 3HKOed by Delibird's Aerial Ace and can OHKO Delibird outright. Defensive Wartortle can take repeated hits from Delibird and 2HKO it with Surf, and offensive variants can even OHKO Delibird.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Aipom can take one attack from Delibird and OHKO it with a Normal-type move. Ponyta, Quilava, Elekid, and Voltorb can all switch into both Aerial Ace and Ice Beam and threaten to OHKO Delibird, but only Quilava can take Hidden Power Ground. Volbeat can switch into anything but Aerial Ace and proceed to KO Delibird with Double-Edge. Abra can OHKO Delibird outright, but it can only switch into a predicted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types</strong>: Castform, Delcatty, and Porygon are not 2HKOed by Delibird, and they threaten to 2HKO it themselves given its terrible bulk. Delcatty and Porygon outright wall Delibird thanks to their access to reliable recovery. Defensive Noctowl can 2HKO Delibird and avoid a 2HKO, while offensive Noctowl can OHKO Delibird. However, Noctowl can be overwhelmed if Delibird sets up a Substitute as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Mightyena</strong>: Intimidate softening Aerial Ace makes Mightyena a workable stop-gap to Delibird, though it doesn't work behind Substitute. Defensive Mightyena is generally bulky enough to avoid a 3HKO from Ice Beam with the help of Protect, and it's strong enough to 3HKO Delibird.

Aerial Ace is Delibird's most reliable strong attack by circumventing the accuracy nerf of Hustle, and it threatens Bug-types such as Ariados, Beedrill, and Dustox. Ice Beam best complements Aerial Ace by threatening physically bulky Pokemon like Onix, Koffing, and Rhyhorn. Hidden Power Ground covers Electric-types like Chinchou, Magnemite, and Flaaffy, and it's Delibird's strongest attack against Corsola. 68 Special Attack EVs let Delibird 2HKO Koffing and Lileep. Delibird hardly has the bulk to make its choice of defense-lowering nature matter, but a Hasty nature at least gives Delibird an 88.3% chance to avoid a 2HKO from physically defensive Mightyena's Crunch. A Naive nature keeps it out of range of Doduo's Quick Attack slightly better, which is helpful when Delibird risks putting itself into range of Quick Attack when using Substitute.</p> <p>Offense teams benefit from Delibird's presence as an especially threatening wallbreaker, but balance teams can make up for Delibird's lack of defensive value by relying on bulkier Pokemon to get it into good positions.

Bulky Normal-types like Castform and Porygon can similarly check Ponyta and Quilava, and they also have good matchups against the fast Electric-types, Elekid and Voltorb. Delcatty is an especially good bulky Normal-type to pair with Delibird, as it can pivot it in safely with Baton Pass. Electric-types like Flaaffy and Chinchou threaten bulky Water-types that would check Delibird, while Delibird pressures bulky Grass-types like Gloom and Tropius that would wall its Electric-type partners. Bulky Normal-types, Electric-types, and Gloom can all support Delibird by spreading paralysis, enabling Delibird to outrun and dispose of fast, frail offensive threats.

After one Dragon Dance, Larvitar is able to outspeed and OHKO most base 85 Speed attackers with either of its STAB moves. Earthquake OHKOes faster attackers such as Staryu, Mankey, and Aipom if Larvitar is holding Soft Sand while threatening Rock- and Electric-types such as Rhyhorn, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Rock Slide provides Larvitar with an option against Flying-types such as Delibird, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Butterfree while also threatening Dustox.

Secondary sweepers that appreciate the removal of special walls and Aipom, such as Growlithe, Masquerain, and Butterfree, pair well with Larvitar. Butterfree's access to Sleep Powder makes it an incredible partner, as it provides Larvitar with more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance.

Seaking, Volbeat, and Choice Band Anorith all threaten Mightyena with their Bug-type STAB attacks, though Mightyena can rely on Intimidate, Toxic, and Protect to wear them down before they finish it off, or it can at least scout their attacks for its teammates. Aipom can use Focus Punch to catch Mightyena switching in and punish it with significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Ponyta, Quilava, and Elekid may lack the bulk to repeatedly switch in on Mightyena, but they still threaten it with significant damage and are not as punished by Intimidate compared to physical attackers. Despite Mightyena generally checking Psychic-types, Smoochum can rely on Ice Beam to break through a chipped Mightyena.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: If unaffected by Intimidate, even physical attackers like Aipom and Doduo can outspeed and overwhelm Mightyena given its lack of immediate recovery.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mightyena lacks any form of recovery beyond Leftovers, so repeated attacks from foes like Seaking, Castform, and Ponyta can overload Mightyena.

        "description": "<p>Mightyena can function exceptionally well in an offensive-defensive role by combining its defensive utility and excellent base Attack. Return trades the recoil drawback from Double-Edge in exchange for a loss in power. This significantly increases Mightyena's longevity and gives it more opportunities to use Heal Bell. Alternatively, if Mightyena chooses to use Rest over Heal Bell, Double-Edge becomes the better alternative, allowing Mightyena to focus offensively. Hidden Power Ground is the most common coverage option, allowing Mightyena to OHKO Flaaffy after a Howl. Hidden Power Fighting is an option to threaten Castform. It also enables Mightyena to threaten Lileep with a 2HKO at +2. Howl allows Mightyena to set up on and threaten passive targets like Drowzee, Dustox, Lileep, and opposing Mightyena. With one Howl boost, Mightyena can threaten a 2HKO on Corsola, Castform, and Seaking. Heal Bell is used to maintain some defensive utility by supporting its teammates and itself as it tries to set up. Rest can often be used with Double-Edge to extend Mightyena's longevity and focus more heavily on wallbreaking with Howl. Roar is an option for setup sweepers such as Anorith, Beedrill, and Tropius that can threaten to set up on a damaged Mightyena. Mightyena's Speed investment allows it to outspeed bulky Castform, while maximum Attack investment helps solidify Mightyena's offensive presence. The remainder is invested in HP.</p> <p>Mightyena fits exceptionally well with balance and offense teams due to the excellent role compression it provides. Wallbreakers vulnerable to status such as Aipom, Seaking, and Volbeat all appreciate Heal Bell support from Mightyena. In return, they can weaken physical walls like Corsola, Koffing, Lileep, and Tropius, enabling Mightyena to use Howl and Return more freely. Volbeat is worth noting, as it can threaten opposing defensive Mightyena sets, which otherwise prove to be a nuisance if Mightyena lacks Hidden Power Fighting. Wish support from Drowzee or Delcatty on more balanced teams is greatly appreciated. However, this requires Mightyena to focus more on Heal Bell usage rather than its offensive capabilities. Thus, Mightyena prefers to use Rest and Double-Edge on more balanced builds, meaning Heal Bell support from Flaaffy or Delcatty is required. Flaaffy in particular makes for a fantastic partner, as it threatens Corsola and can spread paralysis. On more offensive teams, Mightyena greatly appreciates paralysis support from Elekid, Chinchou, and Voltorb. These Electric-types can threaten the bulky Water-types that an unboosted Mightyena can otherwise struggle into, such as Seaking, Wartortle, and Corsola. Ariados can use a slow Baton Pass to enable Mightyena to make use of Intimidate and provide it with more opportunities to use Howl or Heal Bell. Moreover, it can counter and threaten Koffing with Psychic, and in return, Mightyena removes the burn from Will-O-Wisp. Mightyena can set up against Pokemon like Lileep, Delcatty, defensive Ariados, and Dustox if it lacks Whirlwind.</p>"

Intimidate enables Mightyena to dampen physical attackers such as Aipom, Rhyhorn, and physical Noctowl. Thanks to its rare Dark typing, Mightyena is a unique stopgap to Psychic-types like Abra, Drowzee, and Smoochum. Toxic is Mightyena's most reliable move to wear down foes. Protect maximizes Mightyena's recovery from Leftovers, synergizes with Toxic, and helps it scout Choice Band attackers that might try to break through it, such as Meditite. Heal Bell is uncommon and welcome utility, letting Mightyena more comfortably deal with opposing defensive Pokemon like Porygon, Tropius, and Lileep. Return is an alternative to Heal Bell to reduce Mightyena's passivity by dealing reliable damage to a metagame with few Pokemon that resist Normal; it has a chance to 2HKO most Ponyta sets, immediately disposes of Abra, and reliably 2HKOes Meditite. No other common Pokemon in the tier resist Crunch, making it very consistent as a damaging move for Mightyena. Hidden Power Fighting deals better damage to Aipom, opposing Mightyena, and Castform, and it prevents Mightyena from being totally walled by Magnemite.</p> <p>Mightyena's role as a physical stopgap is useful for balance teams, and its ability to run Heal Bell supports defensive cores including Porygon, Noctowl, and Drowzee. Balance teams can compensate for Mightyena's limited recovery with Wish users like Delcatty and Drowzee. Mightyena's Heal Bell support is appreciated by Pokemon vulnerable to status, including Seaking, Tropius, and Castform. Mightyena's defensive value against Psychic-types is much appreciated by Poison-type teammates like Gloom, Dustox, and Koffing, which can handle Meditite's Brick Break in turn. Dustox is another Poison-type that forms a solid defensive core with Mightyena thanks to it handling non-Psychic-type special attackers, while Mightyena can blunt physical attackers like Doduo in turn. Specially defensive partners like Porygon and Castform similarly form solid defensive backbones with Mightyena. Fast cleaners like Ponyta, Quilava, and Abra benefit from Mightyena wearing down foes with Toxic while they threaten Poison-types like Gloom and Koffing that would otherwise wall it. Mightyena especially benefits from partners like the aforementioned Fire-types and Meditite that can mitigate its difficult matchup against Magnemite, and Mightyena can support them with Intimidate to allow these frailer teammates to switch in or set up more comfortably. Setup sweepers like Beedrill, Tentacool, and Anorith especially benefit from Mightyena's Intimidate widening their windows to set up; their use of Substitute has excellent synergy with Mightyena's use of Toxic to further whittle away at foes, and they can set up on Poison-types like Gloom and Koffing that would give Mightyena a hard time.</p>"

Castform and offensive Noctowl can 2HKO Dustox, though Toxic irritates them given their roles as bulky attackers. Meditite, Seaking, and Ariados can run physical coverage moves that beat Dustox.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rhyhorn, Anorith, and Onix can switch into Dustox's attacks and threaten to overwhelm it with their Rock-type STAB moves, though they have to be wary of being worn down by Toxic and Sludge Bomb poisons.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Abra 2HKOes Dustox and can use Psychic sets as setup fodder, especially by using Encore to lock Dustox into Moonlight or Psychic. Drowzee is bulky enough that its Substitute isn't broken by Sludge Bomb, but Dustox can phaze it with Whirlwind and isn't threatened until Drowzee has gained multiple Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Quilava's Substitute is bulky enough to survive a Psychic from Dustox, and it and Sunny Day Ponyta threaten to 2HKO Dustox with Fire Blast. Mixed attacking Ponyta sets generally cannot 2HKO Dustox without having invested a significant amount of EVs in Special Attack.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: Magnemite walls Dustox and can freely set up Substitute in its face, though Dustox can use Whirlwind to phaze it.

Sludge Bomb's good power and chance to inflict poison deter fast, frail attackers like Abra, Ponyta, and Quilava from switching in freely against Dustox. Psychic lets Dustox threaten Koffing and Ariados, take Gloom down with Special Defense drops, and break Substitute against Beedrill. Toxic lets Dustox put opposing bulky Pokemon like Castform, Porygon, and Tropius on a timer, and it punishes Ground-types like Rhyhorn, Cubone, and Onix for trying to switch in. Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers like Calm Mind Corsola, Swords Dance Gloom, and Beedrill. Dustox can also use Whirlwind to phaze Substitute users that would try to take advantage of it, such as Magnemite and Onix. Dustox can outspeed Adamant Cubone when Dustox runs 16 EVs in Speed. A Careful nature should be run if Dustox has Sludge Bomb, and a Calm nature is used if running Psychic.</p> <p>Balance and defensive teams can appreciate Dustox's ability to work as a special wall that blanket checks multiple Gloom sets and Electric-types like Flaaffy. Dustox's Whirlwind is especially helpful as a rare phazing option for defensive teams to deal with setup sweepers like Calm Mind Corsola and Swords Dance Beedrill. Mightyena can check physical attackers and Psychic-types for Dustox, and Dustox checks special attackers for Mightyena in return. Dustox's poison immunity allows it to more freely switch into status, enabling Mightyena to conserve its Heal Bell PP. Bulky Water-types like Wartortle and Seaking can check Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava that would overwhelm Dustox, and it checks Electric-types like Chinchou and Flaaffy for them in return. Corsola and Lileep can check physical attackers like Aipom and Doduo for Dustox, and they can form a complementary defensive core with it, thanks to its good special bulk. Fast attackers like Aipom, Ponyta, and Doduo can more easily clean up teams that have been softened up by Dustox. Fast Normal-types and Fire-types like the aforementioned teammates especially appreciate how Dustox draws in Rock-types like Rhyhorn and Onix to inflict them with Toxic and wear them down. Heal Bell users like Mightyena, Delcatty, and Flaaffy are problematic for Dustox given its reliance on Toxic, so Dustox depends on Pokemon that can threaten those users, including strong wallbreakers like Cubone and Meditite. Dustox can only use Whirlwind to phaze Magnemite if it lacks Psychic, so it relies on partners like Flaaffy and Chinchou to deal real damage. Psychic-types like Abra and Drowzee pressure Dustox, which can be mitigated by teammates like Mightyena and Noctowl.</p>"

Protect provides Nosepass some extra longevity and to scout moves from Choice Band users like Aipom and Pidgeotto. Explosion is used to OHKO offensive switch-ins like Seaking and Staryu, which can open up opportunities for its teammates. Nosepass does great at supporting slower teammates by crippling checks like Lileep, Koffing, and Bayleef with Thunder Wave. It can also slow down offensive threats like Seaking and Delibird. 60 Attack EVs are to KO Magnemite after a Substitute with Earthquake and OHKO Seaking with Explosion, with the rest used to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Nosepass does great on balance teams looking for a catch-all wall for offensive threats like Growlithe, Elekid, and Castform.

Flamethrower is an option with its better accuracy and greater PP since it still does well against the likes of Sunflora and Bayleef, but it fails to threaten Koffing and Dustox. RestTalk is the best recovery option to increase Numel's longevity. It's also worth mentioning that RestTalk gives Numel the ability to stall out Dustox in a 1v1 situation.

Knock Off and Rapid Spin can be used on Choice Band sets in place of Rock Blast or Double-Edge, providing more options for utility.

Hidden Power Flying also punishes Poison-types weak to Flying such as Gloom, Beedrill, and Ariados trying to take advantage of Tropius. Earthquake provides excellent coverage, threatening Pokemon that resist Hidden Power Flying such as Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Earthquake mitigates Tropius's vulnerability to Ponyta and Quilava, and it can let Tropius beat them or significantly weaken them in a pinch if it isn't OHKOed by Quilava's Charcoal-boosted Overheat.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest can be used to try and keep Clamperl healthy to trade more, but it relies on team support through Heal Bell and thus can be inconsistent on a game-to-game basis. Deep Sea Scale gives Clamperl good special bulk, but it is outclassed by other Water-types such as Wartortle in a defensive role due to a low HP stat and no passive recovery through Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Chinchou, Flaaffy, and Elekid all outspeed Clamperl and threaten to OHKO it; though, all of these Pokemon are not able to switch into Clamperl safely.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While they must be wary of Ice Beam, Grass-types such as Gloom can take one hit from Clamperl and threaten an OHKO, but they are unreliable at switching into Clamperl.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong> Due to Clamperl's mediocre bulk, it is often OHKOed by many of the tier's special attackers such as Abra on sets without bulk, while Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Staryu and Quilava can threaten it out as well with chip damage beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong> Physical wallbreakers such as Doduo and Meditite all outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Clamperl. After some chip damage, Pokemon such as Aipom and Anorith can also revenge kill Clamperl.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Clamperl is a huge threat for many slower teams with excellent offenses thanks to Deep Sea Tooth while being able to find common entry points on Pokemon such as Corsola. Surf OHKOes or 2HKOes the vast majority of the tier with the exception of Water-resistant Pokemon. Ice Beam threatens Grass-types with an OHKO in the case of physically defensive Gloom and Tropius while also OHKOing specially defensive Gloom after Surf. Hidden Power Grass threatens Water-types such as Seaking, Chinchou, and Corsola, OHKOing the latter after a Calm Mind boost. Substitute is a great option to punish switching around Clamperl, but Protect can also be used to scout Choice-locked revenge killers. The first EV spread is seen on offensively inclined teams to help Clamperl survive and trade with Pokemon such as Aipom with enough Speed investment to outspeed defensive Gloom. Modest is the preferred nature on this spread, as Timid does not reach any notable speed benchmarks. The alternate EV spread can be used more commonly on balance teams with a Timid nature to improve matchup against Pokemon such as Adamant Cubone and opposing Clamperl.</p> <p>Clamperl fits both on offensive and defensive teams as a wallbreaker. It is especially good at enabling Anorith and Beedrill, with its main targets of entry being Koffing and Corsola, which both teammates can struggle versus. Pokemon like Quilava and Ponyta also appreciate Clamperl trading with Water-types and checking Pokemon such as opposing Ponyta. Clamperl appreciates Pokemon that are able to pivot it in. Ariados and Aipom with Baton Pass can allow it to come in on Koffing or Corsola a lot easier to threaten the opposing team. Wailmer and Voltorb can be good partners, as they can use Explosion on Water- or Grass-types such as Seaking or Gloom while additionally giving Clamperl entry to continue wallbreaking. Notable defensive partners for Clamperl include Flaaffy, Gloom, and Sunflora, with all resisting Electric-type moves that threaten Clamperl while additionally providing offensive pressure against Water-type Pokemon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Bagon has a few other options due to its move pool, but unfortunately, it can't make proper use of them because of its stats or ability. Using Dragon Claw may seem like a good option; however, with base 40 Special Attack, running a Dragon-type STAB move is pointless. Facade may also seem like a worthwhile option, but Bagon lacks Guts, so poison is the only acceptable status.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Bagon is unable to 2HKO Koffing with Double-Edge at +1. This allows Koffing to reliably switch into Bagon and 2HKO in return with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Shuppet</strong>: Shuppet can easily withstand a Hydro Pump and cripple Bagon with its status options or 2HKO with Shadow Ball. Shuppet must be wary of Hidden Power Ghost, as it OHKOes even without an Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Dustox</strong>: Dustox can withstand one Double-Edge at +1 from Bagon and can use Whirlwind to phase it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Bagon is quite frail and is easily threatened by faster attackers that have moves it doesn't resist such as Aipom, Chinchou, and Delibird. These Pokemon make setup opportunities hard to find.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After just one Dragon Dance, Bagon outspeeds the entirety of the unboosted metagame bar Voltorb. This, coupled with its already respectable base Attack and its rare typing, cements Bagon as an extremely effective mid-game wallbreaker and sweeper. Double-Edge is Bagon's strongest physical option, allowing it to threaten common special attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Chinchou after a Dragon Dance. Additionally, Double-Edge hits a majority of the metagame for neutral damage. Bagon is also able to negate the recoil damage from Double-Edge thanks to Rock Head. Brick Break primarily targets Normal- and Steel-types like Aipom, Delcatty, and Magnemite, but it also 2HKOes physically defensive Lileep at +2. Hydro Pump threatens Rock- and Ground-types like Rhyhorn and Cubone. Alternatively, Bagon can use Hidden Power Ghost to avoid being walled by the tier's only Ghost-type, Shuppet. A Lum Berry provides Bagon with a free setup opportunity against status users. The most notable instance of this is against Elekid that may try to use Toxic or Thunder Wave to reduce Bagon's chances of sweeping.</p> <p>Bagon excels on offense and balance teams that aim to take advantage of Elekid that lack Ice Punch. It can withstand one Thunderbolt when healthy and can outspeed and OHKO it after one Dragon Dance boost. Wallbreakers like Pidgeotto and Aipom appreciate this immensely, as Elekid outspeeds them and threatens them with Thunderbolt. Secondary sweepers such as Masquerain, Croconaw, Growlithe, and Butterfree all benefit from Elekid's removal as well. These sweepers can also act as mid-game breakers if Bagon is more poised for a successful late-game. Butterfree is worth mentioning, as its access to Sleep Powder creates more opportunities for Bagon to set up. Bagon can be completely walled by Koffing, so special attackers that threaten it such as Chinchou, Croconaw, and Elekid pair well with Bagon. Elekid is worth mentioning, as it can offensively check Aipom so Bagon doesn't need to rely on a Speed boost from Dragon Dance.</p>"
