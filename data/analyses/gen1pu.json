Its mediocre offenses and lack of decent STAB attacks mean it does pitiful damage despite its access to the excellent Psychic. It's overwhelmed by most physical attackers and 2HKOed by the plethora of Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunderbolt users thanks to its awful Bug / Flying typing. Additionally, while less common, Rock Slide from threats like Graveler easily OHKOes Butterfree. As a fast sleeper, it's completely outclassed by Gastly, which has a much better offensive presence and Speed tier. As a dual status spreader, Butterfree is outclassed by Drowzee, which does more damage and has fantastic defensive utility. Even fringe sleepers like Vileplume and Weepinbell still have more of a use thanks to their niche defensive utility. It is not advised to use Butterfree if your goal is to win.</p>",

This is particularly important if Butterfree is used as a lead, as these threats are themselves common leads. While most slower threats don't want to face Butterfree before Sleep Powder is used, afterwards Drowzee serves as a strong check that doesn't mind its attacks or paralysis, so wallbreakers like Pinsir and Fearow help out considerably. Butterfree is best used to put a foe to sleep as quickly as possible and then try to spread paralysis before being knocked out. Butterfree can notably switch into slower Earthquake users like Machamp and Graveler and then put them to sleep. However, it must be wary of their other attacks, most of which hit Butterfree super effectively or can paralyze it.</p>"

At first glance, Twineedle seems usable and its boosting moves look promising, but Beedrill's incredibly poor stats prevent it from contributing to a victory. It is outsped by premier attackers including every viable Fire-type, Abra, Nidoqueen, Pinsir, and Fearow, all of which OHKO it or come extremely close. Beedrill can only effectively contribute by setting up with Swords Dance and Agility, which is nearly impossible to pull off since even the weakest foes 3HKO it. One would think Twineedle gives it a niche against Psychic-types, but Beedrill flops even against the incredibly frail Abra, OHKOing it a mere 25.6% of the time. Meanwhile, Abra OHKOes Beedrill 72% of the time, before accounting for critical hits, and is faster. Beedrill outspeeds Drowzee but isn't even guaranteed to 2HKO it, and Drowzee has a small chance to OHKO back. The ubiquity of Fire-types does Beedrill no favors, as it deals pitiful damage to them and they outspeed and OHKO it, leaving it few chances to even find entry, let alone progress. In short, Pinsir and Fearow are better attackers than Beedrill on any team.</p>",

Pidgeot hates being paralyzed, so it's best used either as an endgame cleaner, when all opposing paralysis spreaders have been weakened or KOed, or as a midgame wallbreaker, willing to sacrifice itself to aid another cleaner.</p>"

  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Glare and Wrap combined with its solid base 80 Speed gives Arbok the smallest of niches in PU. It can outspeed and Wrap metagame staples like Nidoqueen and Porygon. Against faster foes, Arbok can use Glare to paralyze them and continue using Wrap. However, this is where Arbok's positive traits end. Its terrible Poison typing gives it no notable resistances, weaknesses to common Ground- and Psychic-type attacks, and no useful STAB moves. Combined with its mediocre bulk and Attack, this leaves Arbok struggling to dish out damage while taking significant damage from most threats in return. Arbok's Speed isn't that great either, as common foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow outpace it—teams typically have no shortage of Pokemon that outspeed Arbok. If Arbok finds itself on the receiving end of paralysis, it's practically dead weight to it's team. Arbok is also very unreliable—Wrap is only as accurate as Fire Blast, while Glare is even worse at 74.6%. Even if it can get in against a slower threat, Arbok may just miss twice and get KOed without accomplishing anything. Thus, despite its useful tools, players should generally avoid using Arbok.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Drain can be used as coverage against Graveler, but it only has a 40.7% chance to 2HKO. Body Slam may seem like a means to attack while inflicting paralysis, but Arbok always prefers Glare's higher paralysis odds or Hyper Beam's damage. Rock Slide may seem like good coverage against Fearow and Pinsir, but Arbok always prefers to use Glare or Wrap against them, and Hyper Beam does similar amounts of damage to them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed, Arbok is completely useless, as it can no longer outspeed and Wrap unparalyzed foes, and the chance of full paralysis means it can't reliably use Wrap against paralyzed targets. While Arbok outspeeds every viable Thunder Wave user besides Abra and Staryu, it still risks being paralyzed if Wrap misses or if it switches into Thunder Wave users.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Fearow and Pinsir outspeed Arbok; the former has high odds to KO it with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam, while the latter has a 26.3% chance to 2HKO with Slash. Rapidash and Arcanine also outspeed Arbok and have a 32.1% chance to 2HKO it with Fire Blast, which is accompanied by a 30% burn chance and a high critical hit rate. All of these threats must be wary of Glare, but Arbok's low damage output gives them the opportunity to KO it if it misses Wrap once or twice.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While Nidoqueen, Sandslash, and Graveler are outsped by Arbok, Earthquake 2HKOes it. Arbok is likely to miss Wrap before it can get them into KO range due to their physical bulk and Arbok's poor damage output.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wrap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Wrap and Glare is Arbok's primary draw, as the former immobilizes slower foes, letting it pivot around them or chip them down, while the latter lets it spread paralysis, making more foes vulnerable to its Wrap. While spammable, these moves have low accuracy, and Wrap may give sleeping targets free turns to wake. Earthquake hits Gastly and Rock-types for super effective damage and serves as coverage against top threats like Nidoqueen and Rapidash. Hyper Beam is Arbok's strongest attack against targets that are not weak to Earthquake, serving as a decently powerful finisher against foes like Pinsir and Machamp.</p> <p>Since Arbok is useless when paralyzed, its worst matchups are against faster Thunder Wave users, namely Abra and Staryu. Abra also 2HKOes Arbok with Psychic and is rarely OHKOed by Arbok's Hyper Beam. Drowzee is an excellent partner for its ability to check these threats and has the added benefit of spreading paralysis of its own. Arbok isn't completely helpless against faster threats, as it can try to tank a hit and retaliate with paralysis, but it still often loses due to Glare's low accuracy and the possibility of critical hits or secondary effects like burn. It's also easily overwhelmed by multiple faster opponents. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine all give Arbok a good deal of trouble, so Omanyte is an essential partner for its ability to check all of them. These same fast wallbreakers help Arbok against Pinsir, which outspeeds and does huge damage to it. Other paralysis spreaders like Dragonair and the aforementioned Drowzee also work well in hamstringing these faster threats for Arbok. Using Arbok with multiple Thunder Wave users has the added benefit of making it easier for powerful wallbreakers like Nidoqueen and Fearow to break past their checks.</p>"

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>Sandslash falls into a strange spot in RBY PU. Since Nidoqueen is very common, it can be difficult to envision where Sandslash fits on a team, but its excellent Attack, physical bulk, and superior typing give it a distinct role and matchup spread. While Sandslash isn't a replacement for Nidoqueen, it can check foes that take advantage of Nidoqueen's lower damage output or hit it super effectively due to its terrible Poison typing, like Gastly, Porygon, Machamp, Graveler, Abra, and Drowzee. Gastly in particular is a notable matchup; Nidoqueen takes massive damage from Gastly's Psychic, but it only 4HKOes Sandslash. Sandslash also punishes Porygon's passivity; Porygon's Psychic is unlikely to break Substitute, and Sandslash can set up in front of it to break past its recovery and claim a KO. Sandslash's bulk also allows it to fight Fearow and Scyther effectively, much like Nidoqueen. Sandslash also counters Magneton, of course, letting it fill in for several of Nidoqueen's roles while improving matchups against foes with Psychic- and Ground-type moves.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Sandslash, most of the foes it checks effectively are somewhat niche or rarely seen, making its unique matchup spread wasted in most matches; the more common targets that it checks are also checked by Nidoqueen. Against typical foes, Sandslash's main flaws are its mediocre Speed and Special. It unfortunately struggles against Nidoqueen and Pinsir due to the Speed disadvantage, and many Water-types, such as Staryu and Seaking, also outrun it and threaten painful super effective attacks. Its Attack, while excellent, falls just short of some crucial benchmarks like 2HKOing Fearow, Porygon, and Dragonair, so a sweep is extremely unlikely without immense paralysis support and multiple turns of setup. It also struggles against Fire-types, since they outspeed it and threaten heavy damage and burn. That said, Sandslash does not need to set up to deal effective damage, and its combination of wallbreaking potential and ability to punish passivity with Swords Dance can create difficult games for the opponent. Sandslash, therefore, can fill a role over Nidoqueen on teams that need a Ground-type without the terrible weaknesses afforded by Poison typing, and it can be used over Graveler on teams where its Speed and setup opportunities are more beneficial. However, Sandslash is rare for a reason, and the other Ground-types have broader applicability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash generally lacks other move choices. Slash can be used to cover for pivot attempts and can be used over Swords Dance or Substitute. Body Slam can be used instead of Substitute to fish for paralysis, but it deals relatively poor damage. Hyper Beam initially seems appealing, but Ground-resistant foes like Pinsir and Fearow are weak to Rock Slide anyway, so Sandslash has no reason to take this risk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Sandslash is outsped by Staryu and Seaking, which nearly OHKO it and can survive an Earthquake. Seaking can even set up Agility in front of Sandslash and still win the matchup. Staryu is frail, however, and cannot switch into a healthy Sandslash and win. While Omanyte cannot beat Sandslash one-on-one, it still deals heavy damage and can easily put Sandslash in range of any revenge killer.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Sandslash, which cannot OHKO Nidoqueen without a critical hit. Sandslash is capable of winning the matchup if it sets up Substitute or Swords Dance, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonair</strong>: Dragonair outspeeds Sandslash and can chip it into range of other threats quickly with Wrap; two or three cycles of Wrap are generally enough to put it in range of Water-types, and a few more cycles put it in range of various Blizzard users, including Dragonair itself. Wrap also allows Dragonair to incentivize a set-up Sandslash to switch out to preserve its health, frustrating its attempt to make progress.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Sandslash struggles with most faster foes, as it only tenuously wins these matchups and is vulnerable to critical hits and burns. Arcanine and Rapidash both have a 38.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash, which is exacerbated by their high critical hit chances and Fire Blast's burn chance. Magmar fares better with a 76.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash, but Sandslash has a 43.6% chance to OHKO it in return; while this is a little better for Sandslash, it's still favorable for Magmar overall. Pinsir has a 53% chance to 3HKO Sandslash with Slash, and it can potentially use Bind or Hyper Beam to boost its odds; Sandslash can only 3HKO it in return with Rock Slide. Fearow cannot 3HKO Sandslash outright, but its excellent critical hit rate gives it passable odds to get lucky and win anyway, since Sandslash can only 3HKO it. All of these foes can also revenge kill Sandslash once it takes a hit or two.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake is Sandslash's main attacking option, as the only Pokemon that don't mind it—Fearow, Scyther, and Pinsir—are vulnerable to Rock Slide. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash deals immense damage, notably OHKOing every Fire- and Rock-type as well as Nidoqueen, Scyther, Staryu, and Drowzee; in fact, Sandslash 2HKOes or OHKOes every single Pokemon in the tier after a boost. Swords Dance also helps in some rare scenarios by reapplying Speed and Attack drops from paralysis and burn, respectively, as well as cancelling out burn on Sandslash if it happens to get burned. Substitute helps to facilitate setup and exploit switches or full paralysis, permitting Sandslash to use Swords Dance or begin attacking; since Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave and deals heavy damage to common sleepers, it becomes extremely difficult to stop once safely behind a Substitute. If Sandslash is able to set up both Swords Dance and Substitute, it becomes nearly impossible to stop.</p> <p>Sandslash generally functions as a mid-game attacker, exploiting Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt attempts from Gastly, Magneton, Drowzee, Abra, and Porygon to find entry then following up with Earthquake. Sandslash reliably beats both Psychic-types one-on-one, and Porygon cannot afford to trade hits with Sandslash, as its best-case scenario still leaves it too chipped to avoid a revenge kill; Porygon also often does not run Blizzard, leaving it with inadequate options to damage Sandslash. Gastly and Magneton, of course, are helpless against Sandslash; Gastly's Psychic is a mere 4HKO, leaving it imperiled when Sleep Clause is active, and Magneton has no good options to hit Sandslash, which can easily set up Substitute in front of it. Since Pinsir is rare and neither Fearow nor Scyther can beat Sandslash one-on-one, Sandslash can afford to simply use Earthquake and expect to make decent progress. Sandslash can also duel Fearow late-game to clear the way for teammates to finish the game. Sandslash, therefore, benefits from teammates that can spread paralysis and incentivize opposing Thunder Wave, such as Staryu and Porygon. It also appreciates allies that can chip down faster checks for it; Nidoqueen and Seaking, for example, can help to weaken Fearow and Fire-types for Sandslash to finish off later. Dragonair is notable for its combination of Thunder Wave and Wrap, which can paralyze checks on entry then grant Sandslash a free switch-in.</p>"

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is a staple of PU and is considered mandatory on the vast majority of teams. Its high bulk, good offensive stats, and phenomenal coverage make it the best progress maker in the tier. Since Nidoqueen can 2HKO the majority of the metagame, getting it onto the field unscathed will almost always force the opponent to sacrifice a Pokemon or risk their switch-in taking massive damage, which usually leads to that switch-in losing anyways. Furthermore, Nidoqueen's immunity to Thunder Wave makes it very difficult to cripple without attacking directly. As a result, Nidoqueen is potent at capitalizing on double switches into slower Pokemon, especially those reliant on paralysis like Drowzee and Dragonair, as Nidoqueen usually beats them one-on-one and dissuades them from switching out. These traits also make it effective at removing paralyzed foes. Additionally, Nidoqueen is an excellent check to some of the tier's best offensive threats; it avoids a 2HKO from Fire Blast users and Pinsir and Scyther's Slash and also isn't KOed by Double Edge + Hyper Beam from Fearow, while it can 2HKO them back with super effective moves.</p> <p>However, while Nidoqueen's Speed tier defines PU, for this reason teams typically have no shortage of Pokemon that can outspeed it, leading to it being easily revenge killed. Nidoqueen's typing is far from ideal; as great as its Ground typing is, it has weaknesses to common attacks like Surf and Blizzard, while its useless Poison typing gives it weaknesses to Psychic and Earthquake. Nidoqueen's offensive presence isn't flawless either, as it can't 2HKO Porygon, which can heal off the damage with Recover, though it must be wary of critical hits. Despite its immunity to Thunder Wave, every relevant Thunder Wave user can hit it super effectively, limiting the utility of this trait. In spite of its limitations, Nidoqueen's ability to check so much of PU defines team compositions, and every team needs multiple checks to it to be competitive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Surf OHKOes Graveler, though it has little use elsewhere. Body Slam can fish for paralysis, but Nidoqueen prefers raw damage over an inconsistent paralysis chance. Counter may seem useful for its ability punish foes that use Normal-type attacks, but since Nidoqueen already 2HKOes most foes, it doesn't allow any faster KOs. Nidoqueen's high physical bulk also means Counter will deal less damage compared to other users of the move. However, Counter can punish certain Pokemon after they get a KO, like Fearow, as even when they switch out, Nidoqueen can still use Counter to deal massive damage to the switch-in. Tail Whip can be used to allow Nidoqueen to 2HKO Porygon with Earthquake. While Nidoqueen will likely lose one-on-one if Porygon immediately uses Blizzard, Nidoqueen is favored to win if Porygon uses another move, such as Recover. However, Tail Whip has no use against any other Pokemon in PU, and Porygon can always switch out if it has a teammate that can tank an Earthquake. Initially, Rock Slide may seem like a useful coverage option, but Nidoqueen's Earthquake, Blizzard, and Fire Blast already 2HKO foes that are weak to Rock, leaving it only useful against irrelevant Pokemon like Butterfree. Submission may seem like an option to target Porygon, but it's only marginally stronger than Earthquake with the downsides of terrible accuracy and recoil, and it still fails to 2HKO, rendering it completely useless.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: None of Nidoqueen's attacks 2HKO Porygon, and it can heal off the damage with Recover and threaten Nidoqueen back with Ice-type coverage. However, it must be wary of critical hits, and Porygon loses its ability to consistently check Nidoqueen once paralyzed. Nidoqueen rarely runs Tail Whip, which lets Earthquake 2HKO Porygon, though Porygon is still favored to wint one-on-one when at high health.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: While it's outsped, Seaking is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Thunderbolt, and it can 2HKO Nidoqueen with Surf. It can even set up Agility and still win one-on-one. Staryu outspeeds Nidoqueen and can 2HKO with Surf, though Earthquake and Thunderbolt 2HKO back, so Nidoqueen wins if Staryu gets paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Given that Nidoqueen is often tasked with checking Fire-types, it's very susceptible to burns from Fire Blast. Once burned, Nidoqueen is unable to beat them and other foes that it relies on Earthquake to break through, like Omanyte and Drowzee. While these matchups were shaky before, a burned Nidoqueen has no hope of breaking through Porygon and Machamp. If it lacks Thunderbolt, a burned Nidoqueen also has no effective means to make a lasting impact against Staryu, and it struggles to deal significant damage to other Water-types, like Seaking and Slowpoke.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Abra outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoqueen with Psychic, while Nidoqueen only has a 12.8% chance to OHKO back with Earthquake. While they usually lose one-on-one, faster foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, Magmar, Fearow, and Pinsir can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Nidoqueen. Pinsir is notable as while it loses one-on-one, it can easily switch into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Nidoqueen 4HKOes Machamp, while it can 2HKO with Earthquake, forcing a teammate to switch into Machamp's powerful Body Slam or Earthquake. However, due to its lack of recovery, Machamp cannot check Nidoqueen long-term.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Inducers</strong>: Poliwag and Gastly outspeed Nidoqueen and can put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Poliwag can then use Nidoqueen as setup fodder with Amnesia or 2HKO with Hydro Pump, while Gastly can 2HKO Nidoqueen with Psychic. However, their abysmal bulk and reliance on an inaccurate move mean Nidoqueen can get past them with some luck, as it 2HKOes the former and OHKOes the latter. While slower, bulkier sleepers like Vileplume and Weepinbell can easily tank a hit and attempt to put Nidoqueen to sleep with Sleep Powder; Vileplume is notably not 2HKOed by any of Nidoqueen's attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "The Queen": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set gives Nidoqueen perfect coverage, allowing it to deal significant damage to any foe. Earthquake is Nidoqueen's strongest attack against neutral targets, and it's incredibly safe to use, since nothing resists Earthquake without also taking super effective damage from one of Nidoqueen's coverage moves. Additionally, it 2HKOes prominent foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and opposing Nidoqueen. Blizzard 2HKOes every Flying- and Ground-type besides Nidoqueen itself. Thunderbolt hits Water-types super effectively—it 2HKOes the rare Slowpoke, but it doesn't do significantly more damage than Earthquake to foes like Staryu and Seaking. It's best used to ease prediction, as opponents may try to switch in Fearow or Scyther to take an Earthquake aimed at their Water-type, or if Nidoqueen is burned, as without Thunderbolt it would struggle to damage Water-types. It also helps against the rare Mirror Move Fearow, as a copied Blizzard does significant damage to Nidoqueen. Substitute  eases prediction against foes switching out, and it can exploit attempted sacrifices, which commonly happen once Nidoqueen gets in. However, it's advised not to recklessly use Substitute, as it can cut into Nidoqueen's bulk and make it lose some matchups. For example, setting up a single Substitute leaves Nidoqueen with a 74.2% chance to be 2HKOed by Rapidash and Arcanine's Fire Blast. After losing two Substitutes, it is OHKOed by Nidoqueen's Earthquake. Fire Blast is used to 2HKO Pinsir, which is one the few viable Pokemon that doesn't mind Earthquake or Blizzard. It also lets Nidoqueen fish for burns, which can punish physical attackers like Machamp and Fearow trying to switch in.</p> <p>Nidoqueen should be used on almost every team. It's often used as a mid-game progress maker, as it's fantastic at breaking down the opponent's defenses, priming a cleaner like Fearow or Seaking for an endgame sweep. While it's rarely a team's best option, it can also check offensive threats like Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and Scyther. It can switch into them after they get a KO and force them to stay in as it revenge kills them, eliminating a major threat to its team. Thunder Wave users, like Staryu and Drowzee, are the most effective form of support for Nidoqueen; paralysis mitigates Nidoqueen's mediocre Speed and ruins its single consistent long-term check: Porygon. Machamp is another Pokemon that can consistently switch in and beat Nidoqueen, but it lacks recovery and cannot repeatedly switch in. While Nidoqueen isn't helpless against it, a check like Fearow or Pinsir can handle Machamp. Staryu and Seaking pose issues to Nidoqueen thanks to their Water STAB, so checks to them, like Drowzee for the former and one's own Staryu for the latter, work well. Nidoqueen is a strong lead, being among the few Pokemon that can beat Arcanine one-on-one while not being easy to switch into. However, it tends to take significant damage taking on Arcanine, often losing to critical hits or burns.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Vileplume's good bulk, resistance to Water- and Electric-type coverage, and access to Sleep Powder and Stun Spore let it find a comfortable spot in the PU metagame as a bulky status spreader, threatening tier staples such as Staryu and Nidoqueen with a debilitating status condition. Its Grass typing allows it to switch into and check Seaking lacking Blizzard and wall Staryu lacking Psychic or Blizzard, which is a common sight, as Surf + Thunderbolt Staryu is the most common set. Its bulk is good enough to avoid a 2HKO from super effective coverage moves, such as from Nidoqueen, Gastly, Seaking, and Staryu. Vileplume isn't too bad off in the damage department either, having access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam to boost its already respectable Attack and get switch-ins into range of popular revenge killers such as Fearow and Staryu.</p> <p>However, Vileplume is weighed down by weaknesses to common foes such as Fearow, Fire-types, and Drowzee, being outsped by the first two and 2HKOed by all three. Its matchups versus Arcanine and Fearow are particularly poor, as they can shake off the Speed drop from paralysis with Agility and take paltry damage from all of Vileplumes unboosted attacks, with even +2 Hyper Beam only 2HKOing them both. It's also completely unable to meaningfully damage Gastly, which outspeeds it and can either put it to sleep with Hypnosis or 3HKO it with Psychic. Vileplume's Speed is also incredibly mediocre, only outspeeding Drowzee, Graveler, Omanyte, and unboosted Porygon. This, in tandem with its weaknesses to many common attacking types, makes it hard for Vileplume to effectively attack despite its good bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Mega Drain can be used in place of Stun Spore to OHKO Graveler 53.8% of the time and 2HKO the uncommon Omanyte, which otherwise wall Vileplume. It also 3HKOes Staryu and 4HKOes Seaking. However, the cost of giving up Stun Spore makes Mega Drain generally unadvised. Body Slam can be used in place of Stun Spore or Hyper Beam, as it can still spread paralysis and does not risk a recharge turn. However, this is less consistent than Stun Spore and far less damaging than Hyper Beam, and Vileplume doesn't usually get enough turns on the field to make the most out of the lack of recharge. Body Slam also can't paralyze Normal-types, which is awful for Vileplume, as they can set up Agility while Vileplume can do next to nothing in return. A set consisting of dual status, Body Slam, and Mega Drain can be used, but this is generally ill-advised, as it lacks firepower and does pitiful damage to Fire-types and Fearow, though they despise status. Weepinbell outclasses Vileplume as an attacker with Grass STAB thanks to its access to Razor Leaf.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Although Gastly hates getting statused, it completely walls Vileplume, as it's immune to Hyper Beam. Gastly can comfortably 3HKO it with Psychic in return or retaliate with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar 2HKO Vileplume with Fire Blast, with Rapidash being able to chip it down with Fire Spin into Fire Blast KO range if need be. Vileplume only usually ends up getting one +2 Hyper Beam versus them before going down. However, Rapidash and Magmar are hamstrung by paralysis, and Arcanine also dislikes it.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow 2HKOes Vileplume with Drill Peck and can use Agility to set up on Vileplume and cancel out the Speed drop from paralysis. Vileplume's only way of dealing any meaningful damage back is through a +2 Hyper Beam. Fearow has to set up Agility on the turn before it KOes Vileplume or Vileplume can reapply its Speed drop. However, this ruins Fearow as a revenge killer later, forcing it to stay in and trade versus foes such as Nidoqueen or Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Drowzee and the uncommon Abra both cleanly 2HKO Vileplume with Psychic; the former takes paralysis decently well, and the latter outspeeds it. However, Abra is ruined by paralysis and is almost OHKOed by an unboosted Hyper Beam, and Drowzee is vulnerable to being put to sleep because of Vileplume's higher Speed.</p> <p><strong>Ice- and Psychic-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon sporting Ice-type coverage, such as Nidoqueen, Blizzard variants of Seaking and Staryu, and Dragonair can 3HKO Vileplume, though all of these foes must be wary of status moves. Staryu with Psychic also rarely 3HKOes Vileplume and can potentially drop its Special to guarantee the 3HKO.</p>",

Vileplume can either use Swords Dance in front of a sleeping foe or Stun Spore immediately to predict an incoming foe, as the threat of Swords Dance is usually enough to force a sleeping Pokemon out. +2 Hyper Beam does good damage to all Pokemon barring Gastly and Rock-types, letting Vileplume get foes into range of a strong revenge killer such as Fearow, Nidoqueen, or Staryu. Swords Dance also has the benefit of reapplying the foe's Speed drop from paralysis, letting paralyzed Vileplume outspeed faster paralyzed foes and preventing the foe from using Agility to ignore the Speed drop.</p> <p>Vileplume needs support to handle Fearow, Fire-types, and Graveler effectively. Rock-types such as Graveler and Omanyte make good partners with Vileplume, as they can both wall Fearow, with the latter also walling Fire-types. However, this combination is extremely weak to Nidoqueen and Blizzard users. Blizzard Seaking also makes a great partner to Vileplume, as Vileplume can switch into Surf + Thunderbolt Staryu and incapacitate it with status, letting Seaking sweep unhindered later on, and Seaking helps handle Fire and Rock-types. Vileplume also makes a good partner to Staryu, as it can paralyze faster Pokemon that could give Staryu issues, such as Fearow and Arcanine. It also gets many Pokemon into Staryu's KO range with +2 Hyper Beam. Vileplume can use its status spreading capabilities to support and clear the way for wallbreakers and cleaners such as Nidoqueen and Fearow. Vileplume also helps support slower wallbreakers, such as Graveler.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Parasect is the only fully-evolved Pokemon in RBY with access to Spore, giving it the most consistent Double Powder combination in the game. It also has access to Swords Dance to boost its damage output with Hyper Beam, which can be effective with paralysis support from its teammates. Defensively, Parasect has resistances to Ground, Water, and Electric, meaning it can situationally switch in on Pokemon like Machamp, Seaking, and Staryu. Parasect is also generally unfazed by paralysis, making it a decent early-game status absorber. With these strengths, combined with RBY's brutal sleep mechanics, one would be forgiven for thinking Parasect can work in RBY PU.</p> <p>However, Parasect is entirely outclassed by other sleepers such as Gastly, which has some Speed to back up its Hypnosis, or Drowzee, which has a better typing. This combined with many teams choosing not to use a sleeper at all makes Parasect not worth using. In addition, Parasect's stats are all-around mediocre; its Speed is tied for the lowest among all fully evolved Pokemon. Its terrible typing also makes it very easy to OHKO. This especially applies in RBY PU, a tier filled with powerful Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Arcanine, to prey on its 4x Fire weakness, and other Pokemon like Fearow and Nidoqueen feast on its poor defensive typing as well. Unfortunately, Parasect's positive traits aren't nearly enough to give it a niche in the tier; it should not see use on any serious competitive team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Parasect's game plan is simple: put something to sleep with Spore, then cripple something else with Stun Spore as soon as possible. After this, it can come back late-game when the opposing team is paralyzed and weakened and go on the offensive. Swords Dance reapplies an opposing Pokemon's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Parasect has been used to absorb paralysis itself. Hyper Beam is surprisingly powerful at +2, OHKOing Drowzee and Staryu; it can also KO Dragonair, Fearow, and Porygon if they have taken even slight chip damage. Body Slam is a suitable alternative to either of these moves for reliability and the ability to spread more paralysis, letting Parasect serve a more supportive role.</p> <p>If you must use Parasect, it's best used on teams that hinge on a strong late-game sweeper such as Fearow or Pinsir. Its entire existence hinges on Spore, so the move should never be dropped. While Slash may seem enticing for immediate power, it only lands a critical hit 46.88% of the time because of Parasect’s horrendous Speed, making it unviable. STAB Mega Drain lets Parasect 2HKO Omanyte and Graveler while regaining some HP, but its utility outside of this is questionable. Toxic can be used over Stun Spore to incapacitate partial trapping users such as Dragonair and Rapidash, but whether Parasect gets the opportunity to do this without being KOed or forced out the next turn is another matter.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>High base Attack and Speed combined with solid offensive tools grant Primeape a decent offensive presence. It's capable of threatening just about everything in the tier with either super effective coverage or Body Slam paralysis. Additionally, it's one of the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon with its STAB Submission. However, its bulk is quite poor, so the majority of the tier can 2HKO or 3HKO it. It's also very weak to paralysis, limiting its ability to actually break though defensive pieces like Porygon. To make matters worse, Primeape's offensive presence has major flaws. Body Slam's paralysis chance is often not enough to justify using a Pokemon that deals little damage to common bulky threats like Nidoqueen and Machamp. Its Speed, while fast, fails against the omnipresent Rapidash and Fearow. While it can force paralysis on some important Pokemon and sometimes even get a KO, teams typically prefer offensive threats with higher reward, and thus it's recommended that players avoid using Primeape.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Since Body Slam is still quite threatening to Fire-types, Thunderbolt can be used over Rock Slide. It still 3HKOes Fearow and is Primeape's strongest attack against Slowpoke. Against other Water-types, Thunderbolt and Submission deal similar damage, but Thunderbolt lacks recoil and has much better accuracy. However, Primeape struggles to damage Pinsir without Rock Slide. Low Kick can flinch past some bulky threats when combined with paralysis support, but this strategy is very inconsistent and Low Kick has little use otherwise. Counter can 2HKO some would-be checks like Pinsir and Machamp, but it is very prediction-reliant and has little use against most other threats.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow is immune to paralysis from Body Slam and can outspeed and 2HKO Primeape with Drill Peck. However, it has a 16.2% chance to be 2HKOed by Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Rapidash</strong>: Rapidash outspeeds Primeape and has a 55.2% chance to 2HKO it with Fire Blast, which also threatens to burn it. In return, Primeape can only 3HKO with Rock Slide. However, Rapidash must watch out for a Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Bulky threats</strong>: Machamp is only 4HKOed by Submission and takes less than 40% from Hyper Beam, and it can 3HKO Primeape with its Submission or Earthquake. Nidoqueen can 2HKO Primeape with Earthquake, and Primeape's Body Slam is only a 5HKO in return; Hyper Beam deals less than 40% to Nidoqueen.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly is immune to or takes minimal damage form all of Primeape's attacks barring Rock Slide, which can only 3HKO it, while Gastly can 2HKO with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: The vast majority of the tier has little issue breaking through Primeape's low defenses once its Speed is gone. Common Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Drowzee easily tank two hits from Primeape and paralyze it back. While Porygon does not want to lose over half its health from Submission, it can also take a hit and paralyze Primeape in a pinch.</p>",

Hyper Beam is Primeape's most powerful attack, letting it finish off weakened threats that are out of range of its other attacks, such as Dragonair and Drowzee below half HP and Nidoqueen and Machamp below 40%.

Drowzee has the added benefit of switching into Thunder Wave users fairly well, which helps Primeape avoid getting paralyzed.

However, Poliwag's awful bulk leaves it completely reliant on landing Hypnosis to find any opportunities to set up, rendering it horribly inconsistent. To make matters worse, Poliwag struggles to OHKO targets weak to its Surf at +2, incentivizing further inconsistency by using Hydro Pump to reach these crucial damage rolls. Its Speed, while great, is still worse than several common threats, such as Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine. When choosing a sleeper, teams usually prefer the better offensive and defensive utility from Gastly and Drowzee, and Seaking is usually preferred as a Water-type setup sweeper. Thus, Poliwag should be used with extreme caution due to its reward often being lower than its risk.</p>",

While +2 Hydro Pump always OHKOes them, Rapidash and Magmar can also outspeed and KO Poliwag using a combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam.

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis lets Poliwag put a foe to sleep and provides an opening to use Amnesia, which lets it 2HKO most foes and avoid a 2HKO from Thunderbolt and other special attacks. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is a matter of power versus consistency; Poliwag is already reliant on a very inaccurate move, further complicating this choice. While both Surf and Hydro Pump 2HKO most neutral targets, like Pinsir, some threats that are 2HKOed by a +2 Hydro Pump, such as Machamp and Porygon, either avoid or have extremely low odds to be 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Additionally, a +2 Surf is incapable of OHKOing Nidoqueen and Arcanine and has extremely low odds of OHKOing Rapidash, while +2 Hydro Pump has high odds to OHKO the former pair and will always OHKO the latter. Psychic is Poliwag's best attack against Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking; while Hydro Pump does similar amounts of damage, Psychic's higher accuracy and chance for a Special drop give it solid odds to 2HKO the former and 3HKO the latter at +2. It also helps against Grass-types, as after an Amnesia boost it has decent odds to 2HKO Vileplume, and it will always 2HKO Weepinbell.</p> <p>Poliwag is an effective lead due to its high Speed and access to a sleep-inducing move, though it can also be used as an endgame cleaner. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are common threats that Poliwag loses to quite badly; Omanyte is a great partner, as it switches into all three of them. Paralysis is a great way to handle these faster threats, so Poliwag also appreciates support from Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Porygon.

  "Machamp": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Machamp is a decent blanket check and progress maker in RBY PU due to its decent bulk, base 130 Attack, and decent coverage. It can switch into Nidoqueen, Graveler, and Omanyte and threaten them out with super effective damage, while they threaten Machamp much less in return. Notably, Machamp reliably 2HKOes Nidoqueen with Earthquake while avoiding a 3HKO in return. Although Graveler and Omanyte threaten a 3HKO on Machamp, both are slower and 2HKOed by Earthquake. Machamp's bulk allows it to go toe-to-toe with Pokemon such as Staryu and Porygon, and Machamp can also stop late-game cleaners like Seaking and Scyther with its impressive bulk and Body Slam paralysis chance. Once on the field, Machamp is difficult to force out, as its checks, barring Fearow, cannot switch in safely. While Machamp is outpaced by much of the metagame, its base 55 Speed still gets the job done against noteworthy Pokemon such as Drowzee, Graveler, and Porygon.</p> <p>However, Machamp's Speed is its defining flaw. If given free entry, fast attackers like Fearow can easily force out Machamp with Drill Peck, and if Machamp is at low health, Pokemon like Gastly, Rapidash, Nidoqueen, and Staryu can KO it. While Machamp can switch into a lot of the metagame with its bulk, it can only afford to do so once per game since it gets worn down easily. Even small amounts of chip damage render Machamp incapable of switching into threats, so Machamp tends to get sacrificed for momentum after its first entrance. Similarly, while Machamp's typing means some foes, like Nidoqueen and Arcanine, cannot touch it for super effective damage, its Fighting typing gives it few relevant resistances while giving it a crippling weakness to Drill Peck and Psychic. Machamp's low Speed and role as a switch-in also means that it is often on the receiving end of a burn from Fire Blast or a critical hit from faster foes. Machamp's coverage, while decent, is somewhat prediction-reliant. Earthquake, Rock Slide, Body Slam, and Submission all give free entry to much of the metagame, allowing the opponent to dance around Machamp's coverage and maneuver in something with a better matchup. Pokemon like Gastly and Nidoqueen are only threatened by Machamp's Earthquake, which Fearow can take advantage of. Fearow greatly affects how Machamp is played, as Fearow gaining entry is disastrous due to its one-sided matchup on Machamp. Once Fearow is on the field, the Machamp player is often forced to sacrifice a Pokemon due to Fearow's immense offensive presence. Otherwise-decent moves like Body Slam and Earthquake become risky to use due to the threat of Fearow switching in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Low Kick is an option to 2HKO Porygon and Omanyte while carrying a 30% chance to flinch. However, Low Kick is still inaccurate and its Base Power is so low that in many situations it is better to use Body Slam for more power. Low Kick also does not deal enough damage to allow Machamp to KO Fearow with Hyper Beam afterward. Fire Blast is another option, but since its main targets, Pinsir and Vileplume, are uncommon, it is not worth using. Fire Blast can also fish for a burn on Fearow, but in most situations it is better to do as much damage as possible with Hyper Beam or Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow is by far the biggest reason not to use Machamp. Fearow is so offensively potent that giving it free entry often guarantees losing a Pokemon. Fearow takes little from Body Slam, is immune to Body Slam paralysis, and is immune to Earthquake, while Fearow's Drill Peck is a likely 2HKO on Machamp. Fearow also has a high critical hit rate, meaning it is not rare to see it OHKO Machamp with Drill Peck. For the Machamp user to defeat a Fearow, Machamp needs to hit Fearow with Submission or Rock Slide as it switches in, avoid being OHKOed by a critical hit Drill Peck, and then land a Hyper Beam or Rock Slide. This is a favorable trade for Machamp, but a single miss or critical hit can flip this interaction on its head, and Machamp loses much of its defensive value after taking one Drill Peck.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Once at low health, there is no shortage of revenge killers that can come in and finish off Machamp, such as Nidoqueen, Arcanine, Gastly, and Fearow. If Machamp is paralyzed, Drowzee and Graveler can also come in and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Despite hitting them super effectively with Earthquake, Machamp must be wary of Rapidash and Arcanine since they have a 30% chance to inflict a burn with Fire Blast, which ruins Machamp.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Machamp cannot 2HKO Vileplume, and Vileplume can safely switch in and use Sleep Powder, even if Machamp is carrying Fire Blast. Gastly can switch into a Submission or Body Slam and use Hypnosis or deal significant damage with Psychic. Drowzee loses one-on-one, but a single Psychic allows Machamp to be easily revenge killed.</p>",

Body Slam is a midground option that can paralyze Staryu or Seaking. Hyper Beam can finish off foes like Drowzee, Staryu, and Dragonair. Also, Fearow is usually KOed by Hyper Beam after taking a Submission or Rock Slide beforehand. Submission primarily hits Porygon for huge damage and is a decent midground option against Graveler and Omanyte to deny Fearow a free switch-in due to the fear of a subsequent Hyper Beam. However, Submission has a dreadful 80% accuracy, and recoil often puts Machamp in range of a Fearow Drill Peck. Lastly, Rock Slide mainly is used to 2HKO Fearow and OHKO Scyther 25% of the time. However, dropping any of Machamp's moves for Rock Slide is not advised due to how important each of its other moves are.</p> <p>Machamp is best used as a switch-in to Nidoqueen, Graveler, and Omanyte. All of them are terrified by Earthquake, and the Rock-types can be hit with Submission, which deters Fearow from switching in. Machamp can also come in on Porygon and threaten it for upwards of 78%. Once in, Machamp is best used as a mid-game progress maker by throwing out powerful attacks and leveraging Machmap's impressive bulk. Very little can safely switch into Machamp bar Fearow, which means that Omanyte and Graveler, which can switch into Fearow, are great partners to Machamp. In return, Machamp can switch into Nidoqueen's Earthquake for Omanyte and Graveler. However, it may be worthwhile to sacrifice a Pokemon to give Machamp free entry against Nidoqueen in order to minimize the chances of a critical hit or freeze. Bar switching Rock-types in on Fearow, it is discouraged to switch Machamp out of the field because once weakened, Machamp has a hard time coming back in without sacrificing another Pokemon. Machamp can also switch into Staryu's Thunder Wave or Surf directed at Graveler, since it does not mind paralysis as much as its teammates, as its slow Speed means it doesn't lose too many important matchups once paralyzed; paralysis also insulates Machamp from getting burned. However, a paralyzed Machamp is slower and more afraid of Graveler and Drowzee, as they can usually beat Machamp one-on-one. Paralysis also makes Submission even less likely to hit.</p>"

To make matters worse, while its Razor Leaf destroys threats weak to it, it doesn't do enough damage to save it against neutral targets like Nidoqueen, and it struggles to deal notable damage to Grass-resistant Pokemon like Rapidash, Pinsir, Gastly, and Fearow.</p> <p>Weepinbell also has heavy competition from other status spreaders. Drowzee may be slower, but its Thunder Wave is more reliable and its Psychic-typing grants it both a better offensive and defensive presence. While Vileplume is even less offensively threatening than Weepinbell, its enormous bulk lets it spread status more effectively. Thus, despite the fact that Weepinbell is almost impossible to reliably check without taking status, it offers little else, and thus other status spreaders should be considered before it.</p>",

While threats like Rapidash and Gastly despise Weepinbell's status, it can't threaten them otherwise, so it's reliant on its team to get past these threats. Weepinbell hates getting paralyzed, as it renders its Wrap useless and leaves it outsped by Drowzee and Omanyte, though in some instances it's worth it, such as if Weepinbell trades paralysis with Porygon.</p>"

  "Rapidash": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Rapidash's blazing fast base 105 Speed makes it tied for PU's fastest Pokemon and one of only two that outspeeds Fearow. This in conjunction with a powerful Fire Blast makes Rapidash incredible at revenge killing arguably PU's most dangerous offensive threat and sweeper while also making it a potent revenge killer and progress-maker against the entire metagame. It is notably an effective check against foes such as Gastly, Scyther, and Psychic-types. Its Fire Blast 3HKOes every non-resistant Pokemon at worst, while Body Slam and Hyper Beam coming off a strong base 100 Attack stat threaten every Fire-resistant Pokemon except Graveler, which dislikes taking Fire Blast, and the rare Omanyte. Fire Blast and Body Slam's burn and paralysis chance, respectively, also make Rapidash a potent status spreader that can easily turn the tables against otherwise strong checks like Nidoqueen. Rapidash's fantastic Speed also gives it an incredibly high critical hit rate and lets it make use of Fire Spin to pivot around or wear down foes in otherwise losing matchups.</p> <p>However, Rapidash suffers as a result of it being outclassed in many roles by Arcanine. While Arcanine doesn't outspeed Fearow or learn Fire Spin, it still outspeeds every other relevant threat while packing much higher bulk and slightly higher Attack, letting it trade hits and make progress much more effectively against the metagame in general. It doesn't even matchup that poorly against Fearow, as it survives a Double-Edge into Hyper Beam, which Rapidash fails to do most of the time. Rapidash can find use outside the lead given that Arcanine is PU's best lead, but even in this role it has competition with Magmar; while Rapidash has a superior Fearow and Scyther matchup and access to Agility, Magmar has a much better movepool, improving its matchup against Water-types like Seaking. Rapidash and Arcanine can also be used together without leading either, but these structures tend to be weak to Seaking. As a check to Fearow, Rapidash has competition with Graveler, which walls Fearow and Scyther, though Graveler's low Speed and typing give it a very polarized matchup spread. To make matters worse, Arcanine's excellence means that teams tend to bring multiple answers to Fire-types, such as Nidoqueen and Seaking. Omanyte deserves a special mention, because while it's rare, it stonewalls both Rapidash and Arcanine. Teams using Rapidash must use it alongside Arcanine, taking advantage of the duo's ability to weaken their shared checks while playing to Rapidash's one major advantage over Arcanine, its higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Toxic can be used in conjunction with Fire Spin to increase the amount of damage each turn, but this is unreliable, costs a moveslot Rapidash can't afford, and grants immunity to more impactful statuses. Stomp can be used over Fire Spin or Agility to help Rapidash break through foes with a 47.5% chance of preventing the foe's turn if it's paralyzed. Unlike Fire Spin, even if the foe manages to move, Stomp still does damage. Reflect is another option to increase Rapidash's physical bulk, but it still doesn't let Rapidash beat foes like Nidoqueen unless it can set up the move without taking damage, and fast foes such as Arcanine, Fearow, and opposing Rapidash can bypass the Defense boost with critical hits.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Water-types:</strong> Seaking can 2HKO Rapidash with Surf and usually survives the combination of two Body Slams into Hyper Beam from Rapidash, letting it both switch into and beat Rapidash one-on-one. It can even use Rapidash as setup fodder with Agility. Although Staryu beats Rapidash one-on-one barring paralysis from Body Slam, its physical frailty gives it a much harder time switching in compared to other Water-types, as Hyper Beam can KO it from 68.8%. However, Rapidash also must be wary of paralysis from Staryu's Thunder Wave. Omanyte is without a doubt Rapidash's hardest counter. Fire Blast and Body Slam do a maximum of 12.8% and 13.1% to Omanyte, while its Surf easily 2HKOes Rapidash. Rapidash's best method of handling Omanyte without team support is to burn it with Fire Blast as it switches in, then chip its HP with Fire Spin, using the 6.25% each turn from burn as its main source of damage. The rare Slowpoke can survive Rapidash's combination of two Body Slams and Hyper Beam while 3HKOing it back with Surf, letting it beat Rapidash one-on-one; it can even paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Slowpoke's extremely low Speed means it'll likely be revenge killed after the interaction.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Since Rapidash is reliant on its Speed, paralysis is devastating. Because of this, Rapidash is often forced out by Pokemon it would otherwise beat, such as Drowzee and Dragonair. Rapidash also has to watch out for Body Slam from opposing Fire-types, and it often ends up trading Body Slam paralysis with them. Rapidash can eliminate the paralysis Speed drop with Agility, though Rapidash's middling bulk makes it difficult for it to spend a turn using Agility every time it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users:</strong> Although they all have trouble switching in and fear burn, Nidoqueen, Machamp, Graveler, and Sandslash are all able to 2HKO Rapidash with Earthquake. In return, Rapidash 3HKOes Nidoqueen and Machamp, 4HKOes Graveler, and has a 38.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash. Since all of these Pokemon are slow and fear burn, they prefer to deal with Rapidash once it's paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> Despite being slower, Arcanine easily outdamages Rapidash's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam with its own, and it often carries Agility to negate the paralysis Speed drop. If it carries Reflect, Rapidash has no hope of breaking through it outside of critical hits. Rapidash can often trade hits effectively with opposing Rapidash, with the winner usually being weakened and paralyzed after the exchange. Magmar often runs Counter, forcing Rapidash to use Fire Blast against it rather than Body Slam. Even if Magmar is not running Counter, simply the threat of the move will force Rapidash to predict. Rapidash generally beats Magmar if its already been confirmed to not carry Counter, although Magmar is still able to paralyze Rapidash with Body Slam or get lucky with Confuse Ray, Smokescreen, and Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Fire Blast is Rapidash's strongest move, most notably having a 36.3% chance to 2HKO Fearow, but these odds are bolstered by Double-Edge's recoil, Fire Blast's burn rate, and Rapidash's high critical hit rate. Additionally, Fire Blast's chance to burn lets Rapidash potentially beat Earthquake users, such as Nidoqueen and Machamp. Body Slam allows Rapidash to fish for paralysis, and it in conjunction with Hyper Beam threatens every Fire-resistant Pokemon except for Graveler and Omanyte, letting Rapidash make progress against foes such as Seaking, Arcanine, and Dragonair. Fire Spin complements Rapidash's high Speed, but it is important not to use the move recklessly, as it is very inaccurate, and one miss could result in Rapidash taking paralysis or getting hit by a strong attack. Because of this, Fire Spin is generally recommended only when Rapidash is in a pinch, such as when it needs to beat Nidoqueen one-on-one. Fire Spin also synergizes with Fire Blast burns, as it can wear down foes such as Porygon and Omanyte. Agility is an alternative; while boosting the Speed of the fastest Pokemon in PU might seem redundant, it lets Rapidash negate the Speed drop from paralysis, letting it better take on foes such as opposing Fire-types and Staryu. It also reapplies burn's Attack drop, pairing nicely with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Given Arcanine's sheer excellence as a lead, Rapidash should be used as backup rather than a lead. Generally, lead Arcanine will find itself trading hits with opposing lead Arcanine and lead Nidoqueen, which works well for Rapidash because even if Arcanine gets KOed, it wears down and often inflicts status on a Rapidash check. Nidoqueen is another viable lead, letting players preserve Arcanine and giving them greater flexibility in how they use their Fire-types to weaken their shared checks. Rapidash struggles a lot against Seaking, and teams that use both Rapidash and Arcanine in the back tend to be especially weak to it. Gastly is a great partner for this reason, acting as a fantastic check to Seaking. It also forces Fearow to use Drill Peck against it, allowing Rapidash to switch directly into Fearow in dire situations, since it is much more likely to survive Hyper Beam after Drill Peck as opposed to Double-Edge. In return, Rapidash can check opposing Fire-types and Psychic-types for Gastly. Staryu can notably stonewall Seaking, preventing it from punishing Rapidash outside of double switches. While rare, Omanyte stonewalls both Rapidash and Arcanine, making teammates like the aforementioned Gastly and Staryu useful for this matchup as well. Water-types such as Seaking and Staryu serve as effective checks to Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, with the former even able to use them as setup fodder. Rapidash isn't helpless against Ground-types, however, and it can easily revenge kill these foes or sometimes trade hits with them to enable a teammate like Arcanine. Fearow is another notable teammate that shares checks with the Fire-types, working together with them to weaken and blow past these foes. Magneton is another teammate that can deal with Water-types, while Rapidash in return can lure in and weaken Ground-types.</p> <p>Rapidash is best revealed when its time to revenge kill a foe, notably taking out Fearow after it has taken damage from attacks such as Seaking and Nidoqueen's Blizzard or Gastly's Thunderbolt. Rapidash is best used as a mid-game progress maker, weakening the opposing team to enable a teammate like Fearow to sweep, though sometimes it can act as a cleaner instead if the opposing team is sufficiently weakened. Rapidash can generally be relied upon to beat frailer and Fire-weak foes such as Gastly, Scyther, and the Psychic-types one-on-one, and it also has an even matchup with Staryu when factoring in paralysis and critical hits. In the rare instance that the opponent is using Omanyte, players should aggressively try to switch in checks such as Gastly and Staryu to try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Double switches, especially early-game, can be very punishing against Omanyte. If faced with a foe like Nidoqueen and Omanyte while having no teammate to switch into them, Rapidash can use Fire Spin to try to pivot out into a check.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While its stats are mediocre, Slowpoke is blessed with excellent tools that help mitigate this issue and make it a potent offensive threat in PU. Its initially terrible Special can be boosted with Amnesia, turning it into a devastating wallbreaker that can be very hard to KO. While Slowpoke's Speed is the worst in the game, Slowpoke can actually outspeed many foes due to its access to Thunder Wave and a boosting move. Slowpoke's excellent Water / Psychic typing grants neutral coverage against every foe except itself and lets it hit common threats like Nidoqueen and Rapidash for super effective damage. However, Slowpoke's awful base Special and Speed force it to spend multiple turns setting up, providing time for foes to break through or wear it down. This makes Slowpoke an all-or-nothing Pokemon: it often gets only one opportunity per game to set up, and it will rarely sweep due to how much damage it takes in the process. However, when played correctly, Slowpoke can smash through or cripple key pieces of the opposing team, paving the way for a teammate to clean late-game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest or Reflect can be used over either of Slowpoke's attacking moves. The former increases Slowpoke's longevity, making it easier for it to potentially sweep teams. However, Slowpoke's average physical bulk still leaves it 3HKOed by common foes like Fearow and Nidoqueen. The latter makes it much harder for physical attackers to break through it, but damage can still accumulate quickly over time, and many common physical attackers can bypass this boost through critical hits, such as Fearow and Pinsir. Additionally, only having one attacking move can leave Slowpoke walled by either Psychic-types, like Abra and Drowzee, or Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking. Ice-type moves may initially seem useable, since they target Grass-types and Dragonair, foes Slowpoke has huge trouble with. However, Psychic already hits every viable Grass-type for super effective damage, and if it can land an attack, Thunder Wave is more than enough to ruin Dragonair. Additionally, relying on Ice / Water coverage results in Slowpoke being walled by Water-types, while Ice / Psychic coverage is strictly worse against Psychic- and Fire-types than Slowpoke's STAB combination.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sleep Inducers</strong>: Every unparalyzed sleep user can outspeed Slowpoke and put it to sleep. Notably, Drowzee and Vileplume don't mind paralysis or Slowpoke's unboosted attacks that much, and thus are likely to eventually land sleep. However, other sleepers such as Gastly dislike Slowpoke's attacks and Thunder Wave, letting Slowpoke get past them if it gets lucky.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Nidoqueen, Gastly, Staryu, and Dragonair can 2HKO Slowpoke with Thunderbolt. However, these foes must be wary of taking Slowpoke's boosted attacks, and all but Nidoqueen hate Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Fearow and Pinsir can easily overwhelm Slowpoke while it's setting up. However, they are liable to take paralysis and significant damage while doing so, and thus they prefer only coming in against Slowpoke to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Weepinbell</strong>: Weepinbell outspeeds Slowpoke, and its Razor Leaf has a 53.8% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Weepinbell can also easily put Slowpoke into guaranteed KO range using Wrap, and it isn't OHKOed by a +2 Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Every unparalyzed Pokemon with a partial trapping move can outspeed, pivot around, and wear Slowpoke down into KO range. However, many of these, such as Pinsir and Rapidash, rely on very inaccurate partial trapping moves, and thus they need unreasonable amounts of luck to get Slowpoke into KO range from full. Wrap users and Dragonair in particular threaten Slowpoke the most due to Wrap having the highest accuracy out of any partial trapping move.</p>",

Amnesia boosts Slowpoke's Special, letting it both hit very hard and take special attacks much better. It also reapplies the Speed drop from paralysis, letting Slowpoke outspeed foes even when it's paralyzed. Psychic and Surf are Slowpoke's two main STAB attacks. The former is more spammable due to its chance to lower the target's Special, while the latter hits opposing Psychic-types for neutral damage and hits Fire- and Ground-types like Rapidash and Graveler super effectively.</p> <p>Slowpoke is best paired with speedy and powerful wallbreakers like Fearow and Pinsir, as it can cripple or KO crucial parts of the opposing team, making it easier for them to sweep. Slowpoke can easily set up on Omanyte, making it an excellent partner to Rapidash and Arcanine. Slowpoke enjoys fellow paralysis spreaders like Abra and Staryu, as they let it skip having to paralyze its foe while setting up, and combined they force more paralysis on the opposing team. Slowpoke can be used as a lead, beating or crippling offensive Fire-type leads, like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar. However, Slowpoke loses quite badly to sleep leads, and it's vulnerable to Dragonair's Wrap. Alternatively, it can be used in the back and enter after a threat like Rapidash or Staryu lacking Thunderbolt gets a KO, forcing the opponent into a difficult situation where they must either sacrifice an important Pokemon or give Slowpoke a free turn.</p>"

Farfetch'd OHKOes Abra without needing to risk Hyper Beam, unlike Fearow, but Pinsir's Slash is actually stronger and achieves the same; also, Pinsir is not walled by Rock-types and has much better stats. Farfetch'd also has Body Slam and Swords Dance, which other Flying-types lack, but it will rarely have the time to even set up Agility, let alone a second move. Farfetch'd's poor Speed and bulk make it difficult for it to contribute; attackers like Nidoqueen, Pinsir, Fearow, and all Fire-types outspeed and 2HKO it.

To make matters worse, it is dominated by Gastly, which is only 4HKOed by Fire Blast and is immune to Explosion. While teams lacking Gastly may have some trouble playing around it, Muk is too easy to overwhelm with common threats like Nidoqueen, and thus it's recommended that players avoid using this Pokemon.</p>",

Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir while threatening Grass-types such as Vileplume and potentially burning physical attackers. It is also Muk's strongest attack against Gastly. Alternatively, Hyper Beam lets Muk OHKO Abra, meaning it need not use Explosion to KO Abra. Explosion is Muk's most powerful attack, OHKOing common threats like Fearow and Rapidash, and it deals a minimum of 72% to Nidoqueen. It also has an 84.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, which is important, since Porygon otherwise stonewalls Muk. However, it must be used carefully, as opposing Gastly, Omanyte, and Graveler can easily switch in and sponge the attack. Alternatively, the opposing player can sacrifice a weakened foe, which stops Muk from removing a crucial piece of their team.</p> <p>Mega Drain is an option to threaten Graveler, though it only 2HKOing 40.7% of the time means Muk still risks losing one-on-one. It also lets Muk beat Omanyte if it forgoes Thunderbolt. Acid Armor can let Muk survive more hits from physical attackers, especially if it uses it while they switch in, though Fearow can easily bypass Muk's boosts with its high critical hit rate, and Pinsir's Slash will always do so.</p> <p>Given that it can switch into all of Muk's moves, even Explosion, Gastly is Muk's worst enemy. Thus, Abra and Drowzee are recommended partners. Drowzee has the added benefit of checking opposing Abra, which also gives Muk a considerable amount of trouble. Graveler doesn't fear anything from Muk besides Mega Drain, so Porygon is a good partner. Earthquake users in Machamp and Nidoqueen can outspeed and 2HKO Muk, so checks to them, like Fearow for the former and one's own Machamp for the latter, can be good to handle these threats for Muk.</p>"

Having an Attack stat lower than Oddish means that Onix does pitiful damage and struggles to break through anything, even targets that are weak to its STAB moves. Bind is already an unreliable option due to its terrible accuracy, but it suffers further due to Onix's mediocre Speed, which notably leaves it outsped by Nidoqueen. Onix's huge Defense is held back by its atrocious base HP and weakness to Earthquake, which makes it lose to most physical attackers regardless. Its special bulk fares even worse, as its low HP, even worse Special, and weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice make it lose to nearly every special attacker in the tier. Notably, Nidoqueen's Blizzard OHKOes it 97.4% of the time.

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Drowzee's high Special, Psychic typing, and access to excellent utility options in Thunder Wave and Hypnosis make it an effective support Pokemon. Its combination of good special bulk and not minding paralysis too much let it switch into a plethora of special attackers, like Staryu and Porygon, which are some of the best defensive Pokemon in PU. Once on the field, its dual status threatens offensive and defensive Pokemon alike while dissuading other foes from switching in. The ability to cripple and KO top defensive Pokemon makes Drowzee phenomenal at enabling wallbreakers and sweepers like Nidoqueen and Seaking. While it does not like facing offensive foes one-on-one, when Drowzee is at full health it typically forces out common threats like Rapidash, as they are ruined by paralysis. Drowzee isn't passive either—its STAB Psychic hits most targets very hard, notably dissuading Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Graveler from trying to absorb its Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Drowzee's biggest flaw is its poor physical bulk: physical wallbreakers like Fearow, Pinsir, and Nidoqueen generally have no issue 2HKOing Drowzee, even if they have to take significant damage or paralysis in the process. Drowzee's Speed is another issue, as it only naturally outspeeds Omanyte, Graveler, Porygon, and the rare Slowpoke. Drowzee is thus reliant on its foe being paralyzed to avoid getting overwhelmed and revenge killed, though this is often not an option due to how frequently Drowzee is forced to take paralysis itself. Drowzee's Speed also limits the utility of Hypnosis, as while it can potentially let Drowzee beat just about every offensive check one-on-one, it usually only gets one or two opportunities to fire it off.</p>",

While Fearow doesn't enjoy being paralyzed by Drowzee, it can use Agility to negate its Speed drop.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine can 3HKO Drowzee with Fire Blast and Body Slam while only being 4HKOed by Psychic, barring Special drops. While it doesn't enjoy paralysis, it isn't completely ruined, and many Arcanine carry Rest, which can potentially erase any progress Drowzee makes.</p> <p><strong>Pinsir</strong>: Pinsir outspeeds Drowzee and 2HKOes it with Slash while only being 3HKOed by Psychic, barring Special drops. It does dislike paralysis, however.</p> <p><strong>Scyther</strong>: Scyther 2HKOes Drowzee with Slash and OHKO it with a +2 Hyper Beam while it can only 3HKO back with Psychic. However, Scyther is ruined by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Sandslash outspeeds Drowzee, is immune to Thunder Wave, is only 3HKOed by Psychic, and 2HKOes it with Earthquake—OHKOing after Swords Dance—making it one of Drowzee's worst makchups. While Nidoqueen is 2HKOed by Psychic, it can switch into Thunder Wave and outspeed and 2HKO Drowzee with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: While rare, Vileplume and Weepinbell outspeed Drowzee and can put it to sleep with their reliable Sleep Powder, though they must watch out for Drowzee's STAB Psychic, which 2HKOes them. Gastly and the rare Poliwag dislike their odds against Drowzee due to their frailty, though in a pinch they can use Hypnosis to try to put Drowzee to sleep; Gastly can also use Explosion, which does a minimum of 67.4%.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping Users</strong>: Drowzee's awful Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trapping users such as Rapidash, Dragonair, and Pinsir, which can wear it down and pivot around it. However, Thunder Wave ruins most of these Pokemon, and generally partial trapping moves will miss before Drowzee is put into KO range.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Drowzee</strong>: Given its resistance to Psychic and it not minding Thunder Wave that much, Drowzee can switch into itself fairly well and proceed to weaken itself in the mirror match, leaving the surviving Drowzee easy pickings for the loser's teammates.</p>",

        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Thunder Wave is the key to Drowzee's success: it cripples every foe that isn't Ground-type, ruining offensive and defensive threats like Rapidash and Porygon. Thunder Wave pairs excellently with Drowzee's STAB Psychic, which provides fantastic neutral coverage; it also 2HKOes Nidoqueen, the most common Ground-type, and has a 40.7% chance to 2HKO Graveler. Psychic's chance for a Special drop is quite significant, as it can turn 3HKOes, such as against Omanyte, into 2HKOes, and it prevents Recover users like Staryu and Porygon from trying to PP stall it. Hypnosis is Drowzee's wild card—it dissuades every unstatused foe from switching in and can let Drowzee win otherwise unwinnable matchups against Pokemon like Fearow and Pinsir, but its terrible accuracy makes it extremely unreliable; one or two misses lead to Drowzee being KOed without doing anything. Generally, Drowzee should stick to using Thunder Wave and Psychic to make progress and only use Hypnosis when it forces something out or when its other moves simply won't be enough, such as against Rest Arcanine or Agility Fearow when no switch-ins are available. Seismic Toss targets opposing Psychic-types, notably 4HKOing opposing Drowzee and 3HKOing and 4HKOing the rare Abra and Slowpoke, respectively.</p> <p>Drowzee is best used to support offensive Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Seaking, Machamp, and Sandslash by crippling their checks. Its ability to dominate Porygon is crucial, as very few Pokemon check it while not being easily checked by something else. Drowzee struggles the most against offensive threats that have ways around paralysis, like Fearow with Agility and Arcanine with Rest. Switch-ins to them, like Graveler for the former and Omanyte for the latter, are good partners; Omanyte has the added benefit of countering Rapidash, which despises paralysis but generally beats Drowzee one-on-one. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are themselves good partners, as alongside their ability to trade with each other they can also handle Pinsir, which easily breaks through Drowzee due to its powerful Slash. Despite its weakness to Psychic, Nidoqueen can switch into Thunder Wave and beat Drowzee one-on-one, so checks to it like Porygon and Machamp work well. Fellow paralysis spreaders like the aforementioned Porygon and Staryu also make good partners, as together they maximize the paralysis spread to enable their offensive teammates. Drowzee is a solid check to opposing Psychic-types, as it's reliably able to trade with itself and beat the rare Abra and Slowpoke. In a pinch it can check Gastly, though it must be wary of Explosion, which does around 70%.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hitmonlee is a Pokemon that should never see the light of day in RBY PU despite a few strong points. Its base 120 Attack and the unique STAB move High Jump Kick seem appealing, as High Jump Kick 2HKOes physically bulky Pokemon like Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler; at +1, it's guaranteed to OHKO the first two and has a chance to OHKO Graveler. It also outspeeds some of the tier's offensive threats, such as Nidoqueen and Pinsir. However, it just has too many flaws to really make use of its unique traits.</p> <p>Firstly, all of Hitmonlee's attacking moves are either Normal- or Fighting-type. This makes it difficult for Hitmonlee to damage many foes, but this is especially problematic against Gastly, which is immune to all of Hitmonlee's moves besides Seismic Toss. Hitmonlee's Base 87 Speed falls short compared to offensive threats such as Fearow and Rapidash, which 2HKO it, or Abra, which OHKOes with Psychic. Therefore, Hitmonlee needs extensive paralysis support to work, and it's just not worth it when other Pokemon like Machamp get more mileage out of such a strategy. Finally, its paper-thin defenses mean it has little chance of surviving any interactions, especially against foes that resist High Jump Kick, since Hitmonlee cannot win unboosted. Pretty much the entire metagame can OHKO or 2HKO Hitmonlee regardless of whether or not they can hit it super effectively, so Hitmonlee is best left on the sidelines.</p>",

Body Slam provides some much-needed coverage and consistency, allowing Hitmonlee to dent switch-ins and spread paralysis without support from teammates. For Hitmonlee's final moveslot, Seismic Toss is the best option, as it lets Hitmonlee actually damage Gastly. As far as other options go, Mega Kick deals higher damage than Body Slam, but comes at the cost of lower accuracy and the paralysis chance that makes Body Slam so valuable. Counter can allow Hitmonlee to net a surprise KO against something like Pinsir's Slash, but is generally unreliable and will only work once due to Hitmonlee's pitiful defenses.</p>"}},

Hitmonchan is an awful Pokemon with almost no redeeming qualities; it's much weaker than other physical attackers such as Fearow, Pinsir, and Machamp, and it lacks the Speed of Fearow and the bulk of the latter two to make any meaningful progress. Outspeeding and 2HKOing Porygon with Submission seems nice, but it is completely outclassed in this role by Machamp. Hitmonchan isn't even guaranteed to beat Porygon one-on-one, since Porygon can paralyze it and use Recover to heal the damage from Submission. Although Hitmonchan can KO Porygon if it hits enough Submissions in a row, the move's terrible accuracy along with the chance for full paralysis makes this unlikely to happen. Since Hitmonchan struggles to beat even the Fighting-weak Porygon, it should be no surprise that most of Hitmonchan's other matchups are awful too. Its terrible Special means it cannot effectively utilize its coverage at all, and it's so specially frail that Drowzee and Abra OHKO it with Psychic; additionally, it's 2HKOed by every Fire-type, Water-type, and Gastly. Agility seems like it's a redeeming quality, as no other Fighting-type has this move, but it does not make up for all of Hitmonchan's downsides.

Body Slam hits Nidoqueen and Pinsir for neutral damage and can be used to fish for paralysis. Hitmonchan's fourth move is more flexible. Counter lets Hitmonchan beat Pinsir, but it's very unlikely that any other Pokemon will use a Normal- or Fighting-type move on it.

Lickitung initially looks promising with its access to STAB Hyper Beam and Swords Dance, amazing coverage options, and potential to spread paralysis with Body Slam. However, it falls short everywhere else due to its absolutely horrendous stats. Its atrocious Speed makes it slower than almost every relevant Pokemon, and is 3HKOed or 4HKOed by the majority of the tier. Lickitung can theoretically win one-on-one against physically frail Pokemon like Staryu and Gastly, but the damage taken in return leaves Lickitung easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Lickitung is almost entirely outclassed by Pinsir, which boasts much higher Attack, Defense, and Speed; in fact, Pinsir's Normal-type attacks hit harder than Lickitung's. Lickitung's only niche is its ability to sweep with Swords Dance, which is something Pinsir can do better.

Earthquake is its best option against Omanyte and Gastly, which would otherwise wall it, and the plethora of Fire- and Poison-types in the tier, all of which it OHKOes or 2HKOes at +2. Hyper Beam is Lickitung's most powerful move, and does 60% at minimum to every neutral target in the tier after a Swords Dance.

While its Explosion is difficult to switch into, it's severely held back by Weezing's difficulty in threatening Gastly and Graveler, which can effortlessly switch in and absorb any of Weezing's attacks. To make matters worse, Weezing is largely outclassed by Muk. Weezing's higher physical bulk and Speed are generally less useful than Muk's higher Attack, which allows it to threaten KOs against more foes. Notably, Muk's Explosion is guaranteed to OHKO Fearow and Dragonair, while Weezing's is just a range; Muk also has higher odds to OHKO Porygon and Rapidash.

Horsea also has access to Smokescreen, which makes it much harder for Seaking to reliably set up Agility in front of Horsea and sweep. However, Horsea is much frailer and weaker than Seaking, notably being 2HKOed by Slash from Scyther and Pinsir and Thunderbolt from every relevant user. It is also always KOed by Fearow's Double-Edge into Hyper Beam, and it is 3HKOed by Seaking's Double-Edge and Drowzee's Psychic. This frailty makes it much harder for Horsea to set up Agility compared to Seaking, which has enough bulk to reliably set up and sweep. Horsea's Speed is also poor before it sets up, only outspeeding the likes of Drowzee, Vileplume, and Porygon. Being entirely worse than Seaking means it must not be used as a replacement to Seaking, but as a partner to it. The combination of Horsea and Seaking stacks weaknesses to Staryu and Gastly; Staryu is especially problematic as even Double-Edge Seaking struggles to beat healthy Staryu without a critical hit and Horsea is completely useless into Staryu unless it manages to freeze it.

Smokescreen lets Horsea prevent Seaking from using Horsea as setup fodder. Smokescreen can also be used when desperate, as it can let Horsea win poor matchups with enough luck or force a switch.

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Seaking’s high attacking stats, access to Agility, and excellent STAB make it one of the most fearsome sweepers in the tier. It is capable of blasting through many of PU's top Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, Fearow, and Arcanine, as well as other common foes such as Rapidash, Scyther, and Graveler. Seaking's Water typing is also fantastic defensively, blessing it with important resistances to the common Fire- and Water-type attacks in the tier. Notably, it has few practical weaknesses; Magneton is the only common Pokemon to threaten Seaking with a super effective STAB move. Additionally, Seaking's defenses are high enough to fend off neutral attacks with relative ease. For example, it is only KOed by Fearow's Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam 29.8% of the time, and it always lives Scyther's Hyper Beam at +2. Furthermore, Seaking avoids a 2HKO from every non-STAB Thunderbolt user with the exception of Gastly, which only has a 10.7% chance to 2HKO. Seaking's excellent defensive profile means it can find many opportunities to set up Agility to alleviate its low Speed, and once it is set up, it is very hard to stop if its foe doesn't have the proper tools to take it down.</p> <p>Despite all of its positive traits, Seaking is held back by some poor matchups that prevent it from effortlessly sweeping. The most prominent of these matchups is Staryu; an unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking and completely wall it barring critical hits. Gastly can also switch into Surf once per game and threaten it with both Thunderbolt and Hypnosis. Both Staryu and Gastly are very hard to switch into, so Seaking inviting them in for free can result in a huge loss of momentum. One less common but still dangerous foe that switches into Seaking is Magneton, which only takes up to 30.6% from Surf and threatens Seaking with Thunderbolt. These poor matchups mean that Seaking is typically reserved for the late-game, after its teammates wear down its checks. However, Seaking is lethal to unprepared teams, and the threat of a Seaking sweep should always be considered when building a team and in battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Other options are generally not recommended on Seaking. It can drop Surf and use a set consisting of Agility, Blizzard, Double-Edge, and Hyper Beam in order to handle both Fearow and Staryu, but it makes Seaking much worse against Fire-types and Gastly. Rest can be used to win one-on-one against opposing Seaking and in certain endgames against opposing Fire-types, but it is very easy to punish and seldom worth a moveslot. Seaking can also be a lead, as it matches up well against the two most common leads—Arcanine and Nidoqueen—but it typically invites Gastly and Staryu in early. However, this can also be exploited to pivot into a teammate such as Arcanine or Abra.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Staryu is without a doubt Seaking’s biggest counter. An unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking then use Recover until it KOes itself from Double-Edge recoil. If Seaking uses Hyper Beam or Agility, Staryu can then paralyze it safely and continue to use Recover until it fully paralyzes. Seaking is also able to switch into itself well, and the face-off will typically result in the winning Seaking being at low enough HP that something can revenge kill it, although it will probably be able to fire off one more attack before being KOed if it set up Agility.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly outspeeds Seaking, is immune to its Normal-type moves, and can threaten threaten Seaking with Thunderbolt or Hypnosis. However, it is harder for Gastly to switch into Seaking at +2, as a critical hit Surf into Surf KOes Gastly.</p> <p><strong>Magneton:</strong> Magneton outspeeds Seaking, is 4HKOed by Surf, and 2HKOes in return with Thunderbolt. Magneton can also use Thunder, which has a 61.4% chance to OHKO Seaking.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon is able to threaten paralysis while using Recover to heal off any damage it takes. Porygon can also use Agility to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, making it harder for Seaking to push through the Speed drop with Agility. Switching directly into an attack from Seaking is risky, though, as a critical hit Surf into Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Porygon.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Foes:</strong> Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Dragonair, and even if Seaking is running Blizzard it’s still outsped and can be worn down with Wrap. Similarly, Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Vileplume, giving it a good opportunity to come in and use Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Magmar</strong>: Although it is 2HKOed by Surf, Magmar is much better at handling Seaking compared to Arcanine and Rapidash. It outspeeds Seaking and can use either Confuse Ray or Smokescreen to give Seaking difficulty setting up, and Psychic's chance for a Special drop can severely weaken Seaking. Notably, Magmar avoids a 2HKO from Surf if it is able to drop Seaking's Special before its first attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Surf is Seaking's strongest STAB move and hits a huge chunk of the tier super effectively, OHKOing Graveler and 2HKOing Nidoqueen, Arcanine, Rapidash, and Magmar. It 3HKOes most neutral targets as well, including Fearow, Gastly, and Porygon 95.1% of the time. Agility allows Seaking to function as a deadly sweeper. At +2, Seaking outspeeds every unboosted foe, letting it take advantage of its excellent attacking power. It also negates the Speed drop from paralysis, which allows Seaking to more easily set up on Fire-types that try to hit it with Body Slam. Seaking is also able to set up on Nidoqueen, Fearow, and Scyther. Hyper Beam is most commonly used to blast through Staryu; it does a minimum of 55.1%, and a critical hit Hyper Beam OHKOes Staryu. It also does more damage than Surf to Porygon, Drowzee, and Abra. Notably, a critical hit Surf puts Porygon into Hyper Beam range, but not Surf range. Blizzard 2HKOes Fearow and Scyther; Blizzard into Surf is also heavily favored to KO Fearow and pretty much guaranteed to KO Scyther. Blizzard is also able to hit Vileplume and Dragonair super-effectively, but these foes aren't very common. Alternatively, Seaking can equip Double-Edge to break through Staryu. Double-Edge into Hyper Beam has a 54.3% chance to KO it, but Staryu's access to Recover means Double-Edge is only effective at breaking through Staryu once it's paralyzed or if Seaking has already used Agility.</p> <p>Seaking should be saved for the late-game after Staryu and to a lesser extent Gastly and Magneton are accounted for. Once all of its threats are neutralized, Seaking is free to come in and attempt to sweep. It should have no trouble finding an opportunity to set up; it is able to set up Agility on Nidoqueen, Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Scyther. Once Seaking is set up, it can outright sweep or severely damage an opposing team to the point where its teammates can clean up. However, this may not always happen in practice, and sometimes Seaking is forced into its bad matchups. If the opponent still has a Gastly or Magneton remaining, it may be worth sacrificing Seaking for damage on these foes; two hits from Surf gets Magneton into guaranteed KO range of Fearow's Hyper Beam and Gastly into KO range of most of the tier, doing up to 80.6%. Against a healthy Staryu, Seaking is best off using Agility to outspeed it then fishing for a critical hit Hyper Beam, as Staryu can paralyze Seaking and use Recover to stall out Double-Edge. If Seaking has Blizzard, it is best to fish for a freeze first, then go for the Hyper Beam once it is in KO range from Staryu's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Seaking's best teammates are ones that can wear down its checks early-game to enable it later. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are all able to deal heavy damage to Seaking's strongest checks, Staryu and Gastly. All three have Agility to negate the Speed drop from Staryu's Thunder Wave, and the latter two can paralyze Staryu with Body Slam. In return, Seaking supports them by taking on opposing Fire-types, Nidoqueen, and Graveler, giving them great offensive synergy. Magneton is able to OHKO Staryu, making it a good teammate. Abra and Magmar also have good matchups against Staryu and Gastly, but their lack of Agility makes them more vulnerable to paralysis. Porygon is also an excellent teammate that can bait in Staryu and Gastly and paralyze them, making them easier for Seaking to handle later. Porygon, Magneton, Gastly and Staryu can also help handle opposing Seaking, which can otherwise trade hits with your own Seaking. Nidoqueen is also a good teammate that completely walls Magneton and functions as a Staryu lure; it sacrifices itself for damage on Staryu to make it easy for a teammate like Fearow to revenge kill. Graveler is also a great teammate that walls Magneton while also luring in Staryu. Although Staryu OHKOes Graveler, it will be in KO range from Fearow and the Fire-types if it switched into Earthquake, and Staryu cannot safely use Recover against Graveler due to the threat of Explosion.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Staryu's phenomenal movepool—complete with fantastic coverage, Recover, and most importantly, Thunder Wave—and good Speed make it a dangerous offensive threat and elite paralysis spreader. Its Water-type STAB moves and Speed dissuade Ground-types like Nidoqueen from switching into it, making its Thunder Wave extremely hard to deny. Staryu isn't just limited to spreading paralysis either—STAB Surf and great coverage let it hit most of the tier for neutral damage, and it can hit notable foes like Arcanine, Rapidash, Fearow, and the aforementioned Nidoqueen super effectively. Despite its extreme frailty, Staryu's access to Recover makes it PU's best answer to Seaking, as its typing and Recover wall it completely bar critical hits as long as it's unparalyzed.</p> <p>However, it is essential that players don't overestimate Staryu's defensive capabilities—barring Seaking, just about every common foe can reliably paralyze or 2HKO Staryu, if not both, making it very difficult for it to use Recover outside of when it faces Seaking. Once paralyzed, Staryu loses one-on-one to most foes, especially if it's weakened beforehand. Even Seaking can break through Staryu, as Double-Edge into Hyper Beam has a 54.3% chance to KO. Magneton also threatens Staryu immensely, as it OHKOes Staryu and is only 4HKOed in return by Surf. Staryu's offensive presence isn't perfect either, as while only a handful of Pokemon outspeed it, these include common foes like Fearow, which can KO Staryu after the slightest chip damage, and Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar, which can paralyze Staryu with Body Slam and KO it with Hyper Beam. Slower paralysis spreaders also give Staryu considerable trouble, as while they dislike paralysis, Dragonair can wall Staryu depending on its chosen coverage, Porygon can trade Thunder Wave with Staryu, as it is only 3HKOed by Surf 16.4% of the time and threatens Staryu in return with its coverage, and Drowzee can easily switch into Staryu and threaten it and its team with STAB Psychic and dual status. Staryu also has difficulty fitting all of the moves it wants. Alongside the obligatory STAB Surf and Thunder Wave, it has to choose between Thunderbolt and Psychic as well as Recover and Blizzard, leaving it unable to wall Seaking or threaten foes like Grass-types and Dragonair depending on its choice of coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Hydro Pump can be used to hit higher damage ranges, notably 3HKOing Drowzee and Gastly, as well as having a chance to 3HKO Magneton, though it fails to KO most other foes faster than Surf and is much less reliable due to its shaky accuracy.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Given that Staryu is 2HKOed by much of the tier, once paralyzed, it's easy to take out. Even foes that can't 2HKO Staryu, like Seaking, can overwhelm it after one turn of full paralysis. Body Slam users like Rapidash and Arcanine can fish for paralysis while dealing solid damage, while Thunder Wave users like Porygon, Abra, and opposing Staryu can use Thunder Wave. However, these foes tend to hate taking paralysis themselves and usually dislike Staryu's STAB and coverage options. Dragonair also has access to Thunder Wave and is more than happy to exchange paralysis with Staryu, as it resists Surf + Thunderbolt and can use Agility. Slowpoke can switch into and threaten paralysis on Staryu lacking Thunderbolt, although it is rare and incredibly weak otherwise. Drowzee deserves a special mention, as it minds neither paralysis nor Staryu's attacks that much, only being 4HKOed by Surf, while it threatens Staryu and its team with not only Thunder Wave but also Hypnosis and a strong STAB Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Fearow's Double-Edge 2HKOes Staryu, and its Hyper Beam does a minimum of 81.7%. While Fearow dislikes Thunder Wave, it can negate the Speed drop by using Agility, and it's only reliably 2HKOed by Staryu's Blizzard. Although it cannot set up Swords Dance on Staryu, a +2 Scyther OHKOes it with Hyper Beam. Alongside threatening paralysis with Body Slam, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar outspeed Staryu and can KO it from around 60% using Hyper Beam. Abra outspeeds Staryu and threatens paralysis with Thunder Wave and a 2HKO with Psychic, though it generally despises taking paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton OHKOes Staryu with Thunderbolt and is only 4HKOed in return by Surf. Magneton is also incredibly hard to switch into barring Ground-types, as it threatens paralysis and a strong STAB Thunderbolt on Staryu's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly 2HKOes Staryu with Thunderbolt and is only 3HKOed 75.3% of the time by Surf. It also threatens to sleep Staryu and its teammates with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Vileplume and the uncommon Weepinbell resist Surf and Thunderbolt and threaten Staryu with Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Vileplume's enormous bulk leaves it only 3HKOed by Blizzard and generally 4HKOed by Psychic, while Weepinbell outright OHKOes Staryu with Razor Leaf.</p> <p><strong>Pinsir</strong>: While Pinsir dislikes taking paralysis, it 2HKOes Staryu with Slash and is only 3HKOed by Surf, meaning it comfortably beats it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Staryu can only 4HKO Machamp without Psychic, and Psychic still only 3HKOes it. In return, Machamp 2HKOes with Submission and has a 69.6% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake, and its combination of Body Slam into Submission has high odds to KO Staryu while also threatening paralysis; Machamp dislikes paralysis, though it can still function regardless.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Thunder Wave is critical to Staryu's success, letting it spread paralysis to cripple foes like Rapidash, Porygon, and opposing Staryu. It pairs excellently with STAB Surf discouraging Ground-types from switching in; Surf 2HKOes Nidoqueen and OHKOes Graveler, and since Staryu outspeeds them, it wins one-on-one even if they switch into Thunder Wave. Surf also 2HKOes Fire-types like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar. Thunderbolt is Staryu's primary means of targeting opposing Water-types, notably 2HKOing opposing Staryu and 3HKOing Omanyte and Seaking, limiting the former's opportunities to paralyze Staryu and the latter pair's chances to fish for a critical hit; Thunderbolt also hits Fearow harder than most of Staryu's options, with a 25.6% chance to 2HKO. Psychic is an alternative, notably 3HKOing Gastly and Machamp. Its chance to drop the target's Special makes it threatening against most foes, acting as a strong midground option against Vileplume, as well as opposing Water-types and the rare Weepinbell. Recover lets Staryu effectively check Seaking, as it is a very safe option to use against it. However, it is risky to spam, as many threats like Rapidash and Arcanine can use it to fish for paralysis against Staryu, and using it predictably can allow free entry to foes like Fearow. Blizzard is a potential alternative if Staryu is paired with other Pokemon that can handle Seaking, such as Gastly and one's own Seaking, as it 2HKOes Fearow and Dragonair and 3HKOes Vileplume. It can also let Staryu fish for a freeze, though Staryu is generally better off paralyzing its targets.</p> <p>Staryu is PU's premier answer to Seaking; Seaking's Double-Edge fails to 2HKO and slowly wears Seaking down, and Hyper Beam only deals slightly over 50% and gives Staryu a free turn. If Seaking doesn't use Agility, Staryu outspeeds it, so it can spam Recover as Double-Edge's recoil brings Seaking into KO range. If Seaking uses Agility as Staryu uses Recover or switches in, Staryu can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave, forcing Seaking to use another Agility and giving Staryu potential free turns due to full paralysis. If Seaking is confirmed to not have Double-Edge, it is safe for Staryu to attack it instead of spamming Recover. A healthy Staryu only has to be afraid of Seaking getting a critical hit with Hyper Beam, which OHKOes it.</p> <p>Staryu's excellent matchup against Seaking makes it a good partner to teammates weak to Seaking, like Rapidash, Nidoqueen, and Arcanine. However, it cannot do this when it's paralyzed, and thus it enjoys teammates that can switch into Thunder Wave users, such as Drowzee, Magneton, and Nidoqueen. Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Graveler make great partners for Staryu, as they wall Magneton, which otherwise gives Staryu great trouble, while also appreciating the paralysis Staryu spreads. Staryu also appreciates being partnered with strong physical wallbreakers like Fearow and Pinsir, which are especially adept at removing Drowzee, which otherwise switches into and threatens Staryu with Hypnosis and STAB Psychic with relatively little risk. While Staryu hates paralysis, in some instances it is necessary to be paralyzed, such as trading Thunder Wave with Porygon to enable Nidoqueen or exchanging paralysis with opposing Staryu to enable Seaking. Once paralyzed, Staryu loses virtually all of its defensive utility and is easily overwhelmed, but if it's at full health, it can still be threatening, as it's difficult to OHKO; it also stonewalls Omanyte, since the only thing it threatens Staryu with is paralysis. Staryu is dominated by Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine, as they outspeed and can KO a weakened Staryu, so Rock-types like Graveler for the first and Omanyte for all three work well as partners. Staryu also appreciates Rock-type teammates because it has poor matchups against Arcanine, Rapidash, and Magmar, which it can't switch into well and typicallloses one-on-one to.</p> <p>Staryu can be used at multiple points throughout a game, and its role changes depending on when it is used. It can be used early- and mid-game to revenge kill slower foes such as Nidoqueen; however, this puts it in a position to be revenge killed itself by faster foes such as Fearow and Arcanine, especially if it gets chipped. This means it cannot effectively check Seaking later on in the game. Staryu can be saved throughout the game and avoid getting chipped to effectively check Seaking, although this may exacerbate a team's weaknesses to Fearow and Magneton later on if Staryu's team lacks a healthy check to them.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Scyther's incredible Speed—tied with Rapidash for the fastest in the tier—makes it one of only two Pokemon that outspeeds the ubiquitous Fearow, giving it a near-unique ability to revenge kill it. Scyther's excellent Speed is complemented by a fantastic Attack stat and access to Slash. It can further increase its attacking prowess with the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam; with just one boost, it's capable of outright OHKOing many of the tier's frailer Pokemon, such as Staryu and Drowzee. With two boosts, it becomes near-unstoppable, as its high Speed also makes it extremely difficult to revenge kill. However, Scyther is held back by its terrible coverage and a subpar typing. Scyther's offensive movepool is limited to Normal-type moves and the extremely weak Wing Attack, meaning it is completely walled by Graveler and Omanyte, and it also has trouble breaking through Gastly unboosted. Although Scyther's typing gifts it with a handy immunity to Ground-type moves, every Earthquake user has a move that hits it super effectively. Scyther is also weak to the common Fire-type moves in the tier; notably, Rapidash and Arcanine have a 61.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast. Lastly, Scyther's power falls just short of some crucial damage thresholds. For example, Scyther's Hyper Beam at +2 Attack is unable to OHKO Arcanine, Magneton, and Seaking, and it can only OHKO Fearow 30.8% of the time; additionally, Slash followed by a +2 Hyper Beam isn't a guaranteed KO on Nidoqueen. Scyther also faces competition from Pinsir; although they have different roles on a team, they are often incompatible due to their shared weaknesses, most notably to the common Fire Blast. Scyther boasts higher Speed, while Pinsir has higher physical bulk and power, allowing it to get the damage thresholds that Scyther barely misses out on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>If Scyther pursues other options, Wing Attack should be dropped, although it is usually not recommended due to completely losing the Gastly matchup. Scyther's most common other option is Agility; it can be used to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. This increases the pool of Pokemon that Scyther can set up on, adding foes such as Staryu, Drowzee, and Vileplume to its list of options. This can also be used to win certain endgames that Scyther would otherwise lose by taking paralysis. However, the chance for full paralysis reduces Hyper Beam's accuracy to an effective 67.1%, and considering Scyther typically has to hit multiple Hyper Beams in a row, this sweep can be halted by one unfortunate miss or full paralysis. In addition, Agility can be used to outpace other Agility users, such as Seaking, Dragonair, and Porygon, while also allowing Scyther to not worry about speed ties against opposing Scyther or Rapidash.</p> <p>Substitute can be used to punish switches, such as a weakened Fearow switching out of a predicted Slash, but Scyther can still be paralyzed behind a Substitute. Double-Edge can be used as a midground between Slash and Hyper Beam but it is only useful in highly specific situations and is generally not recommended.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Graveler and Omanyte can switch into all of Scyther's attacks and wall it. The former takes up to 17.8% from Slash and OHKOes with Rock Slide, while the latter takes up to 22.7% from Slash and 2HKOes with Blizzard. Graveler can also freely set up Substitute on Scyther, making it very tricky to switch into.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly is completely immune to Slash and Hyper Beam, and it 2HKOes Scyther with Thunderbolt. Scyther has to rely on the weak Wing Attack to hit Gastly, which does very little when unboosted. However, the move 2HKOes at +2 Attack, meaning Gastly has to hit Hypnosis if it switches into Scyther as it uses Swords Dance, but it can use Thunderbolt instead to get Scyther into KO range for a teammate. Even at +4 Attack, Scyther fails to OHKO Gastly most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Arcanine and Rapidash have a 61.5% chance to OHKO Scyther with Fire Blast; Arcanine always survives a +2 Hyper Beam and Rapidash survives 84.6% of the time. Magmar has higher odds to OHKO Scyther with an 82.1% chance, but Scyther also has an 82.1% chance to OHKO Magmar at +2 Attack, meaning Magmar is better suited for checking an unboosted Scyther.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton has a 79.5% chance to OHKO Scyther with Thunderbolt and always survives +2 Hyper Beam, making it an effective switch-in. It also threatens Thunder Wave to stop Scyther from sweeping even if it manages to survive a hit.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Since Scyther is heavily reliant on its Speed, it must avoid paralysis, especially if it lacks Agility. A paralyzed Scyther is very easy to revenge kill due to its poor bulk and weakness-laden typing. Because of this, it should switch out of Thunder Wave users such as Staryu and Drowzee unless it can KO them. Thunder Wave variants of Porygon are overwhelmingly favored to survive a +2 Hyper Beam, and they cleanly 2HKO Scyther with Blizzard. Vileplume's bulk also lets it survive a +2 Hyper Beam from full HP, although it has to rely on the less accurate Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoqueen and Sandslash are bulky enough to beat Scyther one-on-one. They both easily survive a +2 Hyper Beam and 2HKO Scyther in return. However, Scyther can pair up with other physical attackers checked by them, such as Fearow, to break through, overwhelming these checks with offensive power.</p>",

      "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Scyther boasts the deadly combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, which allows it to set up and sweep an opposing team. Scyther needs to set up on Pokemon that are unable to paralyze or OHKO it, such as Fearow, Nidoqueen, Pinsir, Machamp, unboosted Seaking, and Gastly. Unfortunately, Scyther fails to KO many of these foes at +2 Attack, meaning they must be weakened first. As such, setting up with Scyther often requires baiting one of these Pokemon in, dealing enough damage to put it in KO range of Scyther's +2 Hyper Beam, and then allowing your own Pokemon to faint so Scyther may enter the field safely. At this point, Scyther can use Swords Dance, take a hit, and potentially sweep. Arguably the most important Pokemon that Scyther can set up on Fearow, since its high Speed makes it otherwise difficult to check offensively. However, Scyther must be wary of an OHKO from Fearow's Drill Peck on a critical hit.</p> <p>Slash is a very good option for Scyther if it is unable to find a turn to set up. It can KO frailer Pokemon such as Drowzee and Staryu from 51% and 56.6%, respectively. Most importantly, it does a minimum of 41.1% to Fearow, which is enough to KO Fearow after Nidoqueen or Seaking's Blizzard, and it is favored to KO after Gastly's Thunderbolt. This gives Scyther a safer option to revenge kill Fearow without risking the OHKO from a critical hit Drill Peck. Wing Attack allows Scyther to hit Gastly, notably 2HKOing it at +2 Attack. This means if Gastly switches into Scyther as it sets up Swords Dance, it has to land Hypnosis in order to beat Scyther. If Sleep Clause is already active, the odds become even better for Scyther, as Gastly has to fish for either a critical hit or paralysis from Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Scyther fits best on fast offensive teams that appreciate its Speed and ability to revenge kill Fearow. Seaking is a good teammate that can switch into Fire-types and Graveler. Seaking's Blizzard also gets Fearow into KO range for Scyther's Slash. Porygon can switch into Graveler and Omanyte to wall them and set up Agility. Porygon's Psychic also gets Gastly into KO range for Scyther's Wing Attack at +2. Sleepers such as Gastly, Drowzee, and Vileplume can help Scyther find setup opportunities on sleeping Pokemon. Fire-type allies can trade with opposing Fire-types and Gastly to ease pressure for Scyther. Scyther also fits well on hyper offensive teams that sacrifice utility Pokemon in favor of damage output, as it benefits a lot more from foes being at low HP than from them being paralyzed. As a result, Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Rapidash, Arcanine, Pinsir, and Machamp are good teammates. It is possible to drop Nidoqueen on these teams as well, since teams lacking Nidoqueen generally focus on stacking Pokemon with high Speed, and Scyther can alleviate the Fearow weakness that a team lacking Nidoqueen often suffers.</p>"

  "Magmar": {
    "overview": "<p>NOTE: This analysis was produced prior to the <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/rby-nu-hub.3679758/post-10384972\">December 2024 NU Viability Rankings</a> and the ban on Confuse Ray from RBY PU. As such, it is likely to contain outdated information. Magmar is generally considered good in current PU. The most up-to-date Magmar Set is as follows:</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magmar can run Fire Blast and Psychic on the same set, having the advantages of Psychic's greater accuracy and Fire Blast's extra damage to Fearow and Scyther. However, Magmar already struggles to fit all the moves it wants. Seismic Toss can be used for consistent damage, but it is largely outclassed by Psychic due to Psychic's super effective coverage against Nidoqueen and Gastly as well as the chance to land a critical hit or a Special drop. Substitute can be used with Confuse Ray to make Magmar even harder to KO, but it is competing against Magmar's array of useful coverage moves. Submission can be used to do extra damage to Omanyte, but Omanyte is rare and already hit decently by Psychic.</p> <p>Magmar is occasionally used as a lead, forcing the common lead Arcanine into Counter mind games from turn 1 and letting the player keep their own Arcanine healthy. However, even if Magmar beats Arcanine, it will likely be at low HP or paralyzed, making it easy to revenge kill. Additionally, Nidoqueen is a more effective lead if one wants to preserve their Arcanine, since keeping both Nidoqueen and Arcanine in the back can create a Seaking weakness. As a result, lead Magmar is quite uncommon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Magmar's lack of Agility means it hates paralysis much more than Rapidash and Arcanine. Once paralyzed, Magmar struggles to use Confuse Ray effectively, and its frailty means it will be worn down quickly. As a result, Magmar is often forced out by Thunder Wave users such as Porygon and Drowzee.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Despite Magmar's better Seaking matchup than Rapidash and Arcanine, it is still far from perfect. Seaking 2HKOes it with Surf, while Magmar needs to hit it with Body Slam three times for Hyper Beam to KO. Although Staryu is not a great check to an unparalyzed Magmar, it 2HKOes it with Surf, while Body Slam into Hyper Beam is not a guaranteed KO. The rare Omanyte can also switch into Magmar and beat it, though Magmar can damage it with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Fire-types:</strong> Rapidash and Arcanine are bulkier and faster than Magmar, so they both beat Magmar one-on-one. However, they must be wary of Counter. Once Magmar is confirmed to not have Counter, the two Fire-types beat it. If Rapidash or Arcanine trade paralysis with Magmar, Magmar will be a lot worse off due to its lack of Agility.</p> <p><strong>Fearow and Scyther</strong>: Magmar is much worse into Fearow compared to Rapidash and Arcanine, lacking the Speed of the former and the bulk of the latter. This is amplified if Magmar drops Fire Blast. Magmar doesn't even force Counter mindgames with Fearow since Drill Peck almost always gets it into Hyper Beam range, and Scyther is favored to KO Magmar with a +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen cleanly 2HKOes Magmar with Earthquake. Magmar 3HKOes in return, but it can 2HKO with Psychic if the first one drops Nidoqueen's Special. Fire Blast can burn Nidoqueen, and both moves 2HKO if either hit is a critical hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swagmar": {
        "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <p>Magmar finds a niche in RBY PU thanks to its diverse movepool compared to the tier's other Fire-types. Psychic allows Magmar to hit many top Pokemon without risking Fire Blast's 85% accuracy and makes it the only Fire-type not walled by the rare Omanyte. Magmar's access to Confuse Ray and Smokescreen gives it better matchups against Gastly and Seaking, making it difficult for the former to land Hypnosis reliably and for the latter to set up Agility. It also has Counter, forcing opposing Fire-types to be wary of using a Normal-type attack against it. Despite these upsides, Magmar is still largely outclassed due to its poor stats compared to Arcanine and Rapidash. It should never be used as a replacement for Arcanine, since Arcanine's access to Agility, greater bulk, and superior Attack outweigh Magmar's movepool. Magmar also competes with Rapidash for a spot on a team as a second Fire-type. Although Rapidash has a much shallower movepool, its higher Speed lets it crucially outspeed Fearow, one of the most dominant Pokemon in the tier. Many of Magmar's moves, such as Confuse Ray and Smokecreen, rely heavily on RNG to work effectively. Its competition with other Fire-types and the inconsistency of some of its moves make Magmar a highly specific Pokemon despite the unique advantages it has.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir's gargantuan Attack stat and Slash makes it among PU's most powerful wallbreakers. Slash at minimum 3HKOes every neutral target and 2HKOes some notable foes like Drowzee and Staryu. Thanks to its access to Seismic Toss and Submission, Pinsir lacks any true walls, unlike other offensive threats like Fearow and Seaking. Once on the field, it is an instantly threatening force that virtually no foe can safely switch into; even Pokemon that can switch into Slash and win one-on-one, like Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine, hate having to take so much damage from Pinsir's Slash. Pinsir is also among the few Pokemon in PU that can 2HKO Porygon without a critical hit thanks to Submission. Pinsir's Speed is also quite good, only being outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and the rare Abra and Magmar. Tying with Staryu, it outspeeds every other viable Pokemon, which includes important foes like Nidoqueen, Drowzee, and Porygon.</p> <p>However, Pinsir struggles in a metagame so hostile to it. Pinsir's typing leaves a lot to be desired, as its good physical bulk and useful Ground resistance are overshadowed by its terrible weaknesses to Fire and Flying. Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow all outspeed it and beat it one-on-one, with the former two able to outright OHKO it. Even Pinsir's one good resistance is shaky, as many Earthquake users, like Nidoqueen and Graveler, carry super effective STAB moves or coverage moves that can 2HKO it. Pinsir's main niche as an unwallable wallbreaker is less effective than it would seem at first glance. While all three of Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow are walled by Omanyte, and Fearow is walled by Graveler, both Rock-types are themselves walled by Porygon, making those poor matchups almost unpunishable. Pinsir is itself reliant on Rock-types to not get easily revenge killed by the aforementioned trio, so it's often a liability. Additionally, while Pinsir does have the tools to threaten every Pokemon in the metagame, the moves it relies on to target Gastly and Rock-types can only 3HKO them and most other targets, making it possible to pivot in a check to Pinsir with good prediction. Pinsir's plethora of poor matchups makes it hard to justify on teams when one could simply use another offensive threat that requires less support, though its impact on the metagame canot be ignored when a near mandatory Pokemon, Nidoqueen, often carries Fire Blast solely for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis, but Pinsir generally makes more progress using its standard set. Swords Dance is an enticing option, as the sheer power of a boosted Hyper Beam can OHKO nearly every non-Rock- or Ghost-type, KOing even extremely bulky neutral targets like Arcanine and Nidoqueen after the slightest chip damage. Additionally, a +2 Hyper Beam has a 71.8% chance to OHKO Porygon, and a +2 Submission will always do so. Pinsir can notably take advantage of Porygon to set up, as while it risks taking Thunder Wave, few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's boosted attacks. However, using Swords Dance and Hyper Beam means Pinsir must give up Bind and one of its coverage moves, leaving it unable to threaten certain foes. Pinsir being so easy to force out is another factor that limits the utility of Swords Dance, as it's extremely easy to revenge kill and foes like Rapidash and Arcanine can switch into it as it uses the move.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fire Blast Users</strong>: Rapidash and Arcanine outspeed Pinsir and have a 79.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast, while its Slash only rarely 2HKOes Rapidash and 3HKOes Arcanine. Magmar is almost always 2HKOed by Slash, but it outspeeds and OHKOes Pinsir with its Fire Blast. Nidoqueen 2HKOes Pinsir with Fire Blast, while Slash only 3HKOes back, but Nidoqueen being slower means it needs to be in pristine condition and possibly deal with Bind to win one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow outspeeds Pinsir and has a 96.8% chance to 2HKO with Drill Peck, while Slash only has a 30.7% chance to 2HKO back. However, it is a tenuous check, since it can generally only switch into Pinsir once.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Seismic Toss only 3HKOes Gastly, and it is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves, so it can effortlessly switch in and put Pinsir to sleep with Hypnosis. However, once Sleep Clause is active, Gastly loses one-on-one and will usually need to pivot into in a faster threat, which is predictable.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Pinsir's Submission only 3HKOes Graveler, and its Rock Slide has an 87.6% chance to 2HKO back, which becomes 100% after Submission's recoil. Omanyte loses one-on-one, but it can easily force Pinsir to use Submission or Seismic Toss, allowing it to pivot in a faster threat.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed by threats such as Staryu and Drowzee, Pinsir is easy to overwhelm. Threats that normally lose due to being outsped, such as Seaking and Omanyte, now easily beat Pinsir. Dragonair can also use Wrap to bring Pinsir into KO range. Tenuous checks to Pinsir, such as Nidoqueen, Machamp, and Graveler, find themselves more comfortably able to overwhelm it.</p>",

        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Slash is Pinsir's most spammable attack, 2HKOing or 3HKOing most foes. Submission is Pinsir's strongest attack against Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler, 2HKOing the former two and 3HKOing the latter. Seismic Toss hits Gastly, which is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves. Seismic Toss also lets Pinsir cover switches, as it still deals decent damage to Rock-types, notably 3HKOing Omanyte. It also puts many targets that are 3HKOed by Slash in 2HKO range, such as Machamp and Nidoqueen, and puts Staryu in OHKO range. Bind allows Pinsir to chip foes into KO range and pivot around slower threats. However, given its terrible accuracy, Bind should only be used when necessary.</p> <p>Pinsir can be used as a wallbreaker or a cleaner for its team. When used as a wallbreaker, it's excellent at removing or weakening crucial defensive pieces such as Porygon, Drowzee, and Staryu. This helps speedy offensive threats, such as Rapidash and Fearow, in sweeping late-game. While Pinsir loses one-on-one against Nidoqueen at full health, in a pinch it can switch into Earthquake and tank one Fire Blast, letting it land Slash twice to leave its foe easy to revenge kill. If used as a cleaner, it enjoys the support of wallbreakers such as Nidoqueen and Fearow to weaken defensive Pokemon. Thunder Wave support from teammates such as Staryu, Porygon, and Drowzee is crucial to pave the way for Pinsir's sweep. Pinsir need to be unparalyzed for it to clean, making allies that can switch into Thunder Wave, like Drowzee and Nidoqueen, good partners. Pinsir is easily handled by Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow, which outspeed and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Therefore, Omanyte and Graveler are essential for preventing Pinsir from being easily revenge killed. Pinsir struggles against Rock-types and Gastly, which force it to use its weak coverage moves. Thus, Water-types such as Seaking and Staryu for the former, and Psychic-types such as Abra and Drowzee for the latter, are appreciated. Porygon walls Rock-types, at best Graveler can trade using Explosion, making it a good teammate.</p>"

Ditto's awful base stats are a massive hindrance—it's outsped by the majority of the tier and has subpar bulk, so it generally takes heavy damage before being able to do anything. To add insult to injury, even after using Transform Ditto retains its terrible base HP and low critical hit rate, and it uses its subpar original stats when calculating critical hits it deals and receives. Transform copying stat boosts is almost completely irrelevant in PU, as the tier has few viable setup sweepers. Ditto is a fun gimmick, but if you have the slightest interest in winning, you should never use it.</p>",

Ditto appreciates its targets being paralyzed, as then it can transform without taking a hit, which likewise means it should avoid getting paralyzed as much as possible.</p>"}},

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite possessing the highest BST in PU, Flareon is beyond outclassed. While Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar have much lower attacking stats, their excellent Speed improves their matchups across the board. Flareon's bad base 65 Speed, meanwhile, leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, including key threats like Nidoqueen. Even if it can still win against foes like Abra and Pinsir, having to take an extra hit means it gets worn down quickly and revenge killed by faster threats. Flareon often fails to outdamage faster Fire-types, as their higher Speed lets them launch more attacks against the opposing team. They also have traits that offer more game-to-game utility than Flareon's sheer damage. Rapidash outspeeds Fearow, Arcanine has excellent bulk, and Magmar has a diverse movepool, which notably can let it threaten Omanyte, something no other Fire-type can do.</p> <p>Thus, you can only justify using Flareon alongside another Fire-type and heavy paralysis support. With proper support Flareon is a usable wallbreaker, as besides Omanyte, no Pokemon can safely switch into all of its attacks. Notably, it's among the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon. However, most of the time another duo of Fire-types will make more progress with less support, and thus Flareon should rarely see play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used alongside Fire Spin to let Flareon wear down Omanyte, but this means Flareon must give up Hyper Beam. Reflect can be used over Fire Spin to improve Flareon's matchups against many physical attackers, but its low Speed hampers this. Nidoqueen still 2HKOes Flareon unless it can use Reflect before Nidoqueen can land the first Earthquake, while Fearow's high critical hit rate and Pinsir's Slash can bypass Reflect's Defense boost. While weak, Quick Attack can be used to pick off physically frail foes, like Staryu and Abra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Omanyte's unique typing lets it take minimal damage from all of Flareon's attacks barring the rare Toxic plus Fire Spin combo, making it Flareon's hardest counter. Seaking outspeeds Flareon and 2HKOes it with Surf and is 3HKOed by Body Slam in return, though Seaking must be wary of Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine's higher Speed and physical bulk let it outdamage Flareon one-on-one, especially if it's carrying Reflect.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Earthquake, while Flareon's Fire Blast only 2HKOes 3% of the time. Flareon outspeeds Graveler and 3HKOes it with Fire Blast, but it has a 17.9% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake. The rarer Sandslash speed ties Flareon and has a 33.3% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam while only being 2HKOed by Fire Blast in return. While Fearow fears a burn, it is notably immune to Body Slam paralysis cannot be KOed by the combination of Body Slam and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While they usually lose to Flareon one-on-one, faster threats like Staryu and Pinsir can easily revenge kill Flareon due to their higher Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast can 2HKO most neutral targets and threatens to burn physical attackers. Body Slam lets Flareon fish for paralysis and hits most Fire-resistant switch-ins hard, including Arcanine, Staryu, and Dragonair.

Fire Spin lets Flareon wear down and pivot against slower Pokemon, though its terrible accuracy means it should be used sparingly.</p> <p>Given that the other Fire-types often do Flareon's job better, it's best used alongside Rapidash or Arcanine as a slower but more powerful wallbreaker. Omanyte is the one wall Flareon has no hope of breaking through, so checks to it like Porygon and Gastly are essential partners. Paralysis support is also crucial for letting Flareon overwhelm its foes, so Thunder Wave users like Staryu, Drowzee, and the aforementioned Porygon are important.</p>"

  "Porygon": {
    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Porygon's decent bulk and almost-unique access to Recover give it a unique role in the tier. Very few Pokemon 2HKO it, allowing Porygon to switch in and slowly chip away at foes such as Arcanine and Seaking while using Recover to heal any damage it takes. Porygon also has a wide movepool; in addition to the aforementioned Recover, it has a plethora of coverage moves that threaten much of the tier for super effective damage, and two forms of speed control: Agility and Thunder Wave. Although Porygon's initial Speed is low, it is fast enough to outspeed Graveler and Omanyte, making it an excellent switch in to the Rock-types, which is especially useful since Graveler is tough to switch into otherwise. Porygon's Normal typing also give it an immunity to paralysis from Body Slam, so the Rock-types can't even fish for paralysis against it. This trait is also useful against foes such as Arcanine and Rapidash. Porygon can be played in two main ways; its longevity can allow it to slowly sweep a team with Agility, or it can be used as a wall, using Thunder Wave to spread paralysis throughout an opposing team.</p> <p>Despite seeming excellent on paper, Porygon has several flaws that prevent it from being among the top threats in the metagame. Its Speed is very low, which means if it switches into an attack, it will get hit twice before being able to act. This generally forces Porygon to use Recover right after switching in, making it quite easy to switch into. In addition, Porygon is very weak to critical hits. For example, although Porygon is 3HKOed by Seaking's Surf, if it switches into a critical hit Surf, Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. This also hinders Porygon's ability to switch into Nidoqueen; although it only takes a maximum of 42.3% from Earthquake, it can easily be ruined if it gets critically hit on the switch. Porygon's ability to switch into Omanyte is not unique, as top threats in Gastly, Seaking, and Staryu can all switch into it as well, and Porygon must be wary of Graveler's Explosion. For these reasons, Porygon is often brought in after a teammate is KOed, getting a free Thunder Wave or Agility in retaliation. However, Porygon's paralysis-spreading abilities aren't as useful as they seem, since the ubiquitous Nidoqueen is immune to Thunder Wave, and other top threats such as Arcanine, Fearow, and Seaking can all use Agility to alleviate the Speed drop. PU is also generally just a fast-paced tier where teammates such as Fearow, Seaking, and Arcanine appreciate foes being chipped more than paralyzed. Porygon itself is very vulnerable to paralysis, since one full paralysis on a Recover turn can be enough for a foe to KO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Agility Porygon can use Blizzard over Psychic, as the move does more damage to Nidoqueen, Fire-types, and Fearow, but the move has less PP and only 4HKOes Gastly, giving it more chances to fish for a Hypnosis hit or a Special drop from Psychic. Tri Attack on support Porygon is an alternative to Double-Edge that lacks recoil, but the greater power of Double-Edge makes it the preferred option. Porygon can use Reflect to become near-unbreakable on the physical side, but it is very hard to fit and doesn't help with Porygon's vulnerability to critical hits. Porygon can also run a set consisting of Sharpen, Recover, Hyper Beam, and Agility, but this set requires several turns of setup and is completely walled by Gastly, and it also struggles to break though Water-types.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: A paralyzed Porygon is much easier to KO due to full paralysis preventing recovery. A paralyzed Porygon can't even switch into Omanyte and Graveler effectively anymore, since the Rock-types now outspeed it and 3HKO it. Although Agility Porygon seems to alleviate the Speed issue, full paralysis is still a major problem for it, and other Agility users can reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, making Porygon slow again.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Many Pokemon in the tier, such as Nidoqueen, Fire-types, and Seaking, outspeed and 3HKO Porygon, and this becomes a 2HKO if they get a critical hit. This means Porygon is always taking a risk when it switches in, since a critical hit will put it in KO range for a subsequent attack, immediately forcing the user to sacrifice it or switch out. Once Porygon does switch in, there is still the risk of a critical hit every turn, forcing Porygon to use Recover more often than it wants to in order to mitigate the risk, making it passive.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Drowzee outspeeds Porygon and almost always 3HKOes it with Psychic. Drowzee also has Hypnosis and Thunder Wave to threaten Porygon with status, and it doesn't mind Thunder Wave from Porygon that much. Porygon 3HKOes Drowzee with Double-Edge, but if it drops the move, then Blizzard is only a 4HKO. Porygon lacking Double-Edge also struggles against Abra, since Blizzard 4HKOes while Abra outspeeds and 3HKOes in return with Psychic, although it is ruined by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Although it doesn't appreciate getting hit by Thunder Wave, Machamp easily 2HKOes Porygon with both Submission and Low Kick, while it is only 4HKOed by Blizzard and Double-Edge and 3HKOed by Psychic. Similarly, Pinsir also 2HKOes Porygon with Submission. However, it is important to note that once paralyzed, Submission's chance of landing becomes a pathetic 59.8% and Low Kick is unlikely to connect enough times in a row to break through, so Porygon can beat these foes with luck.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Although Porygon otherwise walls Graveler, it can break through Porygon with Explosion; it has a 43.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, and Porygon's low Speed means it can be revenge killed easily if it survives Explosion. However, it is important to note that once Graveler explodes, Fearow becomes much more deadly, so in some cases it would be wise to invite Graveler's Explosion to enable Fearow. Gastly's Explosion is also dangerous, although its much lower Attack means Explosion will only do a maximum of 60.9%. However, since Gastly is faster, it will end the turn the moment it uses Explosion, preventing Porygon from using Recover. This leaves it in KO range of common attacks such as Nidoqueen's Earthquake and Arcanine's Fire Blast, forcing the Porygon to either sacrifice itself or switch out at low HP, hindering its ability to switch in later.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Since it is slow, Porygon is vulnerable to partial trapping. Dragonair can use Wrap on Porygon and switch in a teammate such as Nidoqueen to force it out, or it can just stay in and wear down Porygon's HP. Although inconsistent, Rapidash's Fire Spin is able to get Porygon into Fire Blast's 2HKO range, since Fire Blast barely misses out on a 2HKO otherwise. It can also let Rapidash pivot out in a pinch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set aims to use Agility to alleviate Porygon's low Speed, letting it act as an effective lead that threatens to slowly sweep a team. At +2 Speed, Porygon is faster than every unboosted foe. When Porygon is faster than its foe, it is able to attack whenever it's at high HP, since if it is hit by a critical hit, it will still be able to use Recover to heal off the damage. Psychic hits almost the entire tier for neutral damage and hits Nidoqueen and Gastly super-effectively. Thunder Wave is most common in the lead slot, as it allows Porygon to spread paralysis early and deal with opposing Agility users, which can otherwise boost to outspeed Porygon. Porygon can also reapply the Speed drop from paralysis with its own Agility. However, limiting Porygon to one attacking move can give it serious coverage and PP issues, especially against Drowzee and the rare Abra. This means that if Porygon is used in the back for a sweeping role, it should choose another attacking move. Thunderbolt complements Psychic very well, as it hits Fearow, Seaking, Scyther, and Staryu super-effectively. Porygon can equip Double-Edge to break through the Psychic-types, but the matchup is still quite poor, and Thunderbolt is a better option against more relevant threats.</p> <p>If Porygon carries Thunder Wave, it is more useful early-game and can even be a viable lead. It can use Thunder Wave immediately on the common Arcanine lead and set up Agility thereafter. Against lead Nidoqueen, it can just set up Agility turn 1 then stall out Earthquake PP with Recover. Porygon generally forces in the opponent's Thunder Wave user, most commonly Staryu, allowing Porygon to trade paralysis with it. Sometimes, Gastly can come in instead to attempt to inflict sleep, but Hypnosis's shaky 60% accuracy makes this strategy risky, and Gastly becomes a lot worse once paralyzed. This benefits teammates like Seaking and Nidoqueen, which can deal with Staryu and Gastly once they're paralyzed.</p> <p>If Porygon is using a set that lacks Thunder Wave, it should be reserved for late-game. Despite negating the Speed drop with Agility, this set still hates paralysis, since full paralysis can prevent crucial turns where Porygon has to use Recover. As a result, it is important to KO or weaken paralysis spreaders such as Staryu, Drowzee, and Vileplume beforehand. Once these threats are accounted for, Porygon should ideally enter the field after a teammate is KOed, since directly switching into an attack leaves it very vulnerable to a critical hit. At this point, Porygon is free to set up Agility and try to sweep. Once Porygon sets up, it should only attack when it is near or at full HP, since it is generally KOed by a critical hit if it's any weaker. For example, a critical hit Earthquake from Nidoqueen can do up to 81.9%. Because of this, Porygon should try to stall Nidoqueen's Earthquake PP then attack once the move's PP is fully depleted. Porygon also faces issues from a trio of very common Agility users in Fearow, Arcanine, and Seaking. They can all use Agility themselves to outspeed even a boosted Porygon; in fact, at +2 Speed, Fearow and Arcanine outspeed even a +4 Porygon. Because of this, it is generally recommended that Porygon attacks these foes right away before they have the chance to set up. However, this issue is alleviated if Porygon carries Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Porygon's best teammates are ones that can weaken Thunder Wave users to enable it late-game. Fearow, Scyther, Arcanine, and Rapidash are great teammates since they do heavy damage to all Thunder Wave users; for example, Fearow's Hyper Beam does up to 86.3% on Drowzee and 96.1% on Staryu. Drowzee is also a good teammate since it can trade Thunder Waves with opposing Drowzee and Staryu. Porygon works well alongside other Agility users such as Seaking and Dragonair, as they can work together to wear down checks and sweep a team. Porygon also appreciates the support of teammates that can check the trio of Agility users. Staryu and Gastly check Seaking, while Nidoqueen can take on Fearow and Arcanine while preventing them from switching out safely. If Porygon is used as a lead, Seaking and Nidoqueen are fantastic teammates that can take advantage of the paralysis that Porygon spreads early-game.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set takes advantage of Thunder Wave and Recover to spread paralysis and wall foes. Porygon paralyzes a foe with Thunder Wave then uses Recover to heal the damage it takes until its foe is fully paralyzed, giving Porygon an opening to attack. Psychic has the best neutral coverage against most of the tier, most notably hitting Gastly super effectively, while Thunderbolt hits top threats such as Fearow, Seaking, and Staryu for super effective damage. Double-Edge is an alternative that hits Drowzee and Abra notably harder, while Blizzard does more to Nidoqueen and Fearow than Thunderbolt, although it gives Porygon a harder time against Water-types.</p> <p>It is not recommended to switch Porygon directly into an attack from faster Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Arcanine, as it leaves Porygon vulnerable to critical hits. The easiest Pokemon for Porygon to switch into are Graveler and Omanyte, as Porygon outspeeds them, allowing it to act before it gets hit a second time. Once Porygon enters the field, it should paralyze the foe and use Recover until the foe is fully paralyzed, then proceed to attack. There are several things to watch out for, though. Agility users can simply use Agility to outspeed Porygon, and Fearow and Arcanine in particular are likely to break through Porygon with critical hits. However, Psychic's chance for a Special drop can re-apply the Speed drop from Paralysis, making the Agility users slower than Porygon once again. Porygon itself hates taking paralysis, since it no longer outspeeds paralyzed foes, and one full paralysis on a Recover turn can be fatal for it. However, in certain scenarios it is worth trading Paralysis with a foe, such as paralyzing an opposing Staryu to enable one's Seaking.</p> <p>Since Porygon walls Graveler and Omanyte while unparalyzed, Pokemon that are forced out by the Rock-types, such as Fearow, Scyther, Rapidash, and Arcanine, are great teammates. They also have great matchups against Thunder Wave users, such as Drowzee and Staryu, making it harder for the opponent to paralyze Porygon. Seaking appreciates Porygon's ability to trade paralysis with opposing Staryu, which walls Seaking while unparalyzed, allowing Porygon to enable a Seaking sweep. Porygon also appreciates other Thunder Wave users to make it easier for Porygon to switch into foes.</p>"

  "Omanyte": {
    "overview": "<p>Omanyte's combination of solid bulk and a Rock / Water typing perfectly counters Rapidash and Arcanine, denying them meaningful progress, and also makes it an effective switch-in to Fearow and Scyther. As these Pokemon are incredibly common offensive threats, Omanyte will almost always have several opportunities to stop a powerful progress-maker in its tracks and then make its own progress. However, while few Pokemon enjoy switching into Omanyte's decently powerful Surf and Blizzard or risking Body Slam paralysis, choosing the wrong move for its switch-in—such as Surf for Seaking or Body Slam for Gastly—leaves it in a bad position. Most of these foes can also switch into Omanyte's attacks at least once and still beat it one-on-one. Omanyte also has an especially hard counter in Porygon, as Omanyte cannot 2HKO or paralyze it while Porygon can heal off the damage with Recover. Omanyte's terrible Speed makes it loses the one-on-one to a variety of metagame threats, such as Nidoqueen and Drowzee, which can force a powerful attack or status condition on one of Omanyte's teammate as it's forced out. Omanyte's low HP also leaves it extremely vulnerable to fixed-damage moves, which 3HKO it. Additionally, its switch-ins are very predictable, making it exploitable with double switching. Pokemon checked by Omanyte have ways to mitigate its effectiveness, as Fearow's sheer power and critical hit rate can quickly wear it down, while Rapidash can use Fire Spin to switch out if its team lacks a decent Omanyte switch-in. Effective use of Omanyte requires a team that can handle its shortcomings and careful management of its HP, and despite walling some top threats, players should consider other options before using Omanyte.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is much stronger than Surf, notably having around a 47% chance to 2HKO Gastly, a 59% chance to 2HKO Abra, an 83% chance to 2HKO opposing Omanyte, and an 85% chance to OHKO the rare Sandslash, feats Surf can never achieve without a critical hit. Hydro Pump's extra damage against Drowzee leaves it always in range of Machamp's Hyper Beam or two Seismic Tosses, and it gives Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash favorable odds to KO Drowzee as well. However, Hydro Pump's poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable, with Surf usually being preferred over its inconsistent counterpart.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon outspeeds Omanyte, isn't 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard, is immune to Body Slam paralysis, and can heal off damage with Recover, making it Omanyte's worst matchup.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: While they all dislike paralysis, none of Omanyte's attacks do significant damage to any of the tier's Water-types, whereas they can easily overwhelm it with their STAB moves in return. Staryu can wall Omanyte indefinitely as a result of its access to Recover, while Seaking can set up Agility to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. The rarer Slowpoke and Poliwag can use Omanyte as setup fodder for Amnesia freely.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly is uniquely immune to Body Slam while only being 3HKOed by Surf, affording it numerous opportunities to switch in and threaten Omanyte with its higher Speed, Hypnosis, and a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Drowzee</strong>: Drowzee can outspeed and put Omanyte to sleep with Hypnosis and can usually win the one-on-one with Psychic if sleep isn't available.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: Machamp outspeeds and 2HKOes Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 3HKOed by Surf in return. While they cannot switch in, Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and the rare Sandslash outspeed and 2HKO Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 2HKOed in return, allowing them to easily win the one-on-one or pick off a weakened Omanyte.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While rare and vulnerable to Blizzard, Weepinbell and Vileplume serve as effective Omanyte checks. Both outspeed it; the former OHKOes Omanyte with Razor Leaf, while the sheer bulk of the latter allows it to reliably 2HKO Omanyte with Mega Drain. Both threats can also put Omanyte to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is a decently strong attack that 3HKOes most neutral targets and 2HKOes some notable foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Nidoqueen. Blizzard serves as coverage against Fearow, Scyther, Dragonair, and the rare Grass-type such as Vileplume. Body Slam lets Omanyte fish for paralysis on all of its switch-ins barring Gastly and Porygon, allowing Omanyte to still make some progress against Water-types such as Staryu and Seaking. Rest is Omanyte's only form of recovery, but it's unreliable due to the number of turns it leaves Omanyte helpless and thus is best used to secure late-game victories against Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow.</p> <p>Omanyte partners well with many offensive Pokemon that are outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Scyther, and Fearow, such as Pinsir and Machamp. Ironically enough, Rapidash, Arcanine, Scyther, and Fearow also appreciate Omanyte's support, as it secures their mirror matchups and protects Fearow and Arcanine from being revenge killed. In return, these wallbreakers and sweepers can power through defensive Pokemon such as Staryu, Porygon, and Drowzee, which Omanyte can't break past on its own. These threats can also check foes that give Omanyte trouble, such as Machamp handling Nidoqueen and Rapidash handling Pinsir. On the defensive end, Staryu is a great partner for its ability to eternally wall Seaking, which otherwise can use Omanyte as setup fodder. Drowzee, while not as iron-clad, is capable of checking special attackers, such as Gastly, Abra, and Staryu, which give Omanyte trouble. Paralysis support from these Pokemon also goes a long way in helping Omanyte's team break through Porygon for it.</p>"

    "outdated": true,
    "overview": "<p>Dragonair is a versatile support Pokemon in PU that carries a unique defensive typing, a wide array of coverage moves, powerful utility in Thunder Wave and Wrap, and the ever-present threat of AgiliWrap. While it's outclassed as a support Pokemon by Drowzee and Porygon and outclassed as a damage dealer by anything with a good STAB move, its sheer versatility allows it to surprise foes and force them to accept paralysis or chip damage on Pokemon they may have preferred to save for later. Dragonair's base 70 Speed notably puts it ahead of Seaking, allowing it to wear down Seaking with Wrap. This also enables it to check slower foes like Drowzee and Porygon as well as paralyzed foes, forcing paralysis onto the opposing team or forcing in Nidoqueen to scare out Dragonair, as other Ground-types are too slow to do so. Notably, Dragonair's Dragon typing allows it to resist Fire Blast, Surf, and Thunderbolt, making it an excellent pivot and a huge threat to Fire-types as well as Water-types that don't carry Blizzard, allowing it to check Rapidash, Arcanine, and often Staryu. Dragonair can carry super effective coverage for these foes in return, 3HKOing the Fire-types and 2HKOing Staryu; it can also paralyze them and potentially use Wrap to chip them down if it avoids paralysis itself.</p> <p>Dragonair has several flaws that hold it back, including its relative frailty, middling Speed, and Ice weakness. It also has some difficulties with prediction, as using Thunder Wave as Nidoqueen comes in can be a disastrous loss of momentum. Nidoqueen outspeeds Dragonair and threatens it immensely, so Dragonair is usually forced out if it hasn't already set up Agility. Gastly also stonewalls Wrap and forces Dragonair to fight it with relatively weak special moves, but it's heavily threatened by Thunder Wave, which leaves it vulnerable to Earthquake users later in the game. Dragonair's typing provides no STAB, making its damage output poor against neutral targets such as Gastly and Porygon as well as rare foes like Pinsir and Machamp. Paralysis also holds Dragonair back significantly, limiting Wrap and forcing it to trade hits with stronger, bulkier foes; this makes it hard to fight fast Thunder Wave users like Staryu and even Abra. Finally, Dragonair is extremely limited in moveslots; it wants all of Agility, Thunder Wave, Wrap, and several coverage attacks, but it can only either fit all of the utility moves and a single attack, or it can fit two attacks at the cost of Agility or Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Agility can be dropped to fit an additional coverage move, but this sacrifices a lot of potential chip damage and utility, so it should not be done lightly. Hyper Beam has a small chance to OHKO Abra and deals high damage to Staryu and Drowzee, but Thunderbolt already covers Staryu, and none of these three take Wrap hits well. This also leaves Dragonair even more helpless against Gastly and risks a recharge turn if used recklessly. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir, but this is too niche of a matchup to cover over others, and both Thunderbolt and Blizzard already cover Scyther, a more relevant threat.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly outspeeds Dragonair, takes no damage from Wrap, and takes little damage from Dragonair's attacks, allowing it to interrupt Dragonair with Hypnosis. However, Dragonair is often content with landing Thunder Wave on it to make it fodder for teammates like Nidoqueen, and it can use Wrap to pivot out and bring in allies that handle Gastly better, making it risky for Gastly to stay in and blockade Wrap. Dragonair lacking Thunder Wave is utterly helpless, however, and relies on teammates to bait out and remove Gastly first.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis severely hampers Dragonair, making Wrap horribly inconsistent and limiting it to setting up Agility and scoring some chip damage. This is not completely horrible in matchups where Dragonair has super effective coverage, but when it doesn't, it contributes very little damage before falling.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: A burn heavily limits Dragonair by making Wrap a losing proposition, forcing it to simply look for paralysis and chip damage from its special attacks before it falls.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: The near-omnipresent Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Dragonair while being immune to Thunder Wave; even Blizzard, Dragonair's strongest option against Nidoqueen, rarely 2HKOes it. Dragonair can potentially set up Agility against it, but Blizzard leaves it in range of many attacks should it miss one Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Blizzard Users</strong>: Staryu rarely runs Blizzard, but it threatens paralysis to stop any Agility plays and can then 2HKO Dragonair if packing Blizzard. Seaking and the rare Omanyte can also punish Wrap misses with Blizzard for massive damage.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fearow, Scyther, and the rare Pinsir outspeed and can 2HKO Dragonair, making setup costly, as one Wrap miss ends Dragonair's rampage. Pinsir is also not weak to any of Dragonair's common moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Dragonair's moveset is incredibly diverse, but all Dragonair sets tend to focus on supporting its team via chip damage and paralysis. To this end, Dragonair nearly always runs Wrap, which helps to chip down foes, pivot teammates in safely, and forces paralyzed foes to switch out, preventing them from blocking Thunder Wave. Agility should be on most Dragonair sets, making all of its moves far more threatening; after Agility, it outspeeds the entire tier, allowing it to inflict a fearsome amount of chip damage with Wrap and win one-on-one against a variety of threatening foes even without Wrap, including Arcanine, Rapidash, and Fearow. This also partially insulates Dragonair against paralysis, allowing it to cancel the Speed drop and threaten foes with paralysis and super effective coverage. Dragonair usually runs Thunder Wave to spread status, allowing it to disable and use Wrap against faster foes without reliable ways to inflict paralysis, such as Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow. It may also choose to sacrifice itself in certain scenarios to paralyze a threat like Staryu or Agility Porygon, allowing teammates to more easily remove them. Agility synergizes surprisingly well with Thunder Wave, allowing Dragonair to present more of a threat and force in foes that would rather not take paralysis, like Gastly and Staryu, to try to slow them down with status. It also allows Dragonair to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis to foes with Agility. Surf is the attacking move of choice for Dragonair using Thunder Wave, as its combination of PP and coverage fits well with speed control and Wrap. Surf 3HKOes Arcanine, Rapidash, Magmar, and Nidoqueen; OHKOes Graveler; and deals decent damage to most targets. Anything that can handle Surf bar Gastly is unlikely to enjoy taking repeated Wrap hits. Thunderbolt can be substituted over Thunder Wave to improve Dragonair's coverage, 2HKOing Staryu, usually 2HKOing Fearow after Double-Edge recoil, and 3HKOing Seaking. Blizzard is an uncommon option that helps Dragonair do more damage to Nidoqueen and Fearow as well as covering for less common foes like opposing Dragonair and Vileplume, but this costs it super effective coverage against the highly threatening Fire-types and adds little compared to Surf or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>When running only one attack, this set often works as an anti-lead to the common Arcanine, threatening to paralyze it and use Wrap to force it out as well as threatening Agility should Arcanine try to pivot to Nidoqueen to block Thunder Wave. In this role, Dragonair is a sacrificial Pokemon looking to spread paralysis and chip damage, particularly to Gastly, to allow teammates to follow up against neutered foes. Surf helps Dragonair to fight common leads like Arcanine and Nidoqueen, and Dragonair happily trades Thunder Wave with Staryu and Porygon should they attempt to stop it. Once it paralyzes these foes, they become fodder for slower attackers that would otherwise struggle, such as Nidoqueen and Seaking. Agility helps to force Gastly to block Wrap, allowing Dragonair to paralyze it and either take sleep, or, with a 47% chance, dodge Hypnosis and use Wrap to pivot out while denying sleep. In this role, Dragonair benefits heavily from teaming up with Nidoqueen, which OHKOes Gastly and 2HKOes Staryu but struggles against them due to their superior Speed and super effective moves. It is also effective at enabling allies like Agility Porygon, Seaking, and Scyther by paralyzing and wearing down foes that would otherwise give them trouble.</p> <p>Dragonair run outside of the lead more commonly have two attacks for coverage, most often forgoing Thunder Wave to act as a scary Agility sweeper that can soften up entire teams for its allies or even win outright. In this role, Dragonair seeks to set up against a foe without a consistent way to paralyze it—such as a Fire-type, non-Blizzard Seaking, or even Nidoqueen— and use Wrap to wear foes down. The biggest benefit of expanded coverage is that Dragonair can punish the use of chipped Pokemon to tank Wrap; on a Wrap miss, it can punish with an attack, which is especially deadly against frail foes like Fearow and Staryu. In this role, Dragonair works well with allied sweepers and cleaners that need slight damage to enable them. For example, Scyther comes just shy of OHKOing a number of foes at +2, and a few hits from Wrap easily make up the difference. Similarly, moderate chip damage helps enable allies like Rapidash and Fearow to clean through entire teams. However, this Dragonair lacks Thunder Wave and therefore makes for a poor enabler for slower allies like Nidoqueen that might appreciate paralysis more than chip damage.</p>"
