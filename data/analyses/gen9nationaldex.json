        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high mixed natural bulk and resistances to many prominent offensive types, along with its natural ability to ignore Knock Off and status conditions, Mega Venusaur becomes a decent Mega Evolution for a myriad of team compositions. Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Earth Power is required to hit Heatran and also to prevent the likes of Gholdengo, Sneasler, and Kartana from taking advantage of Mega Venusaur’s STAB options. Giga Drain hits most foes that resist its coverage moves like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Great Tusk for neutral damage. It also gives more healing opportunities, since Synthesis has low PP. The given EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outspeed Landorus-T and Moltres, potentially KOing them with a crucial Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Mega Venusaur pairs well with teammates with a strong offensive presence, since they can fall back on its defensive capabilities to break throughout the course of a game. Specifically, since Mega Venusaur is unfazed by Knock Off and status conditions, it can reliably check Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana can utilize its defensive capabilities and ability to switch into their checks to wallbreak more consistently. However, Mega Venusaur is very vulnerable to entry hazards, so allies that can remove them like Rotom-W and Great Tusk make great partners. Mega Venusaur is also easily checked by the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Lele, which can threaten it with powerful STAB moves, and Skarmory, which ignores damage from its moves. Some good teammates that can cover and check these include Gliscor, Heatran, and Gholdengo; in exchange, Mega Venusaur can check opponents like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, since Synthesis heals less in rain, Mega Venusaur has reduced longevity against this archetype despite its resistance to Water, so it will need additional support from teammates like Gastrodon and Rotom-W to cover this.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y stands out as a powerful wallbreaker thanks to its high Special Attack and its ability, Drought. Weather Ball is recommended for its high damage, perfect accuracy, and ability to pressure rain teams by doing magnificent damage to Pelipper in rain. Flamethrower is a great alternative, allowing Mega Charizard Y to maintain its STAB move outside of sun, but at the cost of being slightly weaker than Weather Ball. Fire Blast is less reliable due to its accuracy but serves as a powerful nuke, capable of OHKOing Gliscor after Stealth Rock and guaranteeing a 2HKO against Galarian Slowking and Garchomp. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off potential Stealth Rock damage and act as a soft check to Mega Scizor and Rillaboom. Under sun, Solar Beam hits instantly and provides excellent coverage to obliterate bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Scorching Sands 2HKOes Heatran and pressures Toxapex, Gouging Fire, and Raging Bolt while also having the chance to burn threats that can switch into Mega Charizard Y's moves, like Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar. Focus Blast enables Mega Charizard Y to OHKO Mega Tyranitar while still allowing it to hit Heatran effectively, but its poor accuracy and ineffectiveness against Toxapex make it a less recommended choice. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Kartana, and Landorus-T allow Mega Charizard Y to come in more often, as it is incredibly weak to Stealth Rock; Great Tusk in particular benefits from sun thanks to Protosynthesis boosting its Attack, letting it break past foes like Mega Latias and Dragonite for Mega Charizard Y more easily. Mega Charizard Y’s mediocre Speed and below-average bulk leave it vulnerable to revenge killers like Mega Diancie, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp. Therefore, defensive switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Alomomola, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Galarian Slowking create great synergy with Mega Charizard Y. Weavile is a fantastic partner for its ability to beat Dragon-types such as Mega Latias, Garchomp, and Dragonite; it also appreciates Mega Charizard Y forcing foes like Alomomola to Tera Dragon. Raging Bolt also serves as an excellent partner, benefiting from Mega Charizard Y's Drought with Protosynthesis, which boosts its Special Attack, allowing it to break through Pokemon like Garganacl more easily.</p>"

Clefable is an effective Stealth Rock user due to its ability to threaten or cripple the majority of entry hazard removers, including Great Tusk, Kartana, and Tornadus-T, forcing out the former and paralyzing the latter two. Knock Off lets Clefable cripple switch-ins like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking, severely cutting into their longevity. Thunder Wave helps Clefable incapacitate offensive threats like Volcarona, Heatran, and Ogerpon-W. Trick alongside Sticky Barb gives Clefable a more efficient tool in wearing down its sturdier switch-ins like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Toxapex, opening up avenues for its teammates to sweep more easily. Leftovers can be used instead of Rocky Helmet to provide some passive recovery, letting Clefable check Mega Medicham more easily. Tera Water lets Clefable take a Steel-type attack in a pinch and is a generally useful defensive type. Clefable works best on bulkier teams that can take advantage of its durability and role compression. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Gliscor are solid partners, as they can form a potent hazard-stacking core, which is especially solid alongside Clefable’s Knock Off. The latter especially works well with Clefable, as it can pivot in on Heatran and Galarian Slowking, which both force Clefable out. Offensive Pokemon such as Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile are also good partners, as they appreciate Clefable crippling their checks like Heatran and Toxapex. While Clefable’s bulk is solid, it is often not enough to function as a sole check to the powerful offensive threats in the tier, so it is best to pair it with a sturdier teammate like Toxapex, Slowbro, or Galarian Slowking that can scout wallbreakers and spread out the defensive load.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to switch freely in spite of any entry hazards. Tera Steel can be used in a pinch to check foes like Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Lele, letting it either cripple them with a Scald burn or use Teleport into a revenge killer. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta appreciate Slowbro's FuturePort to bring them in safely on foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl and subsequently pressure their switch-ins like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Toxapex with the impending Future Sight. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Heatran help cover threats like Tapu Koko, Volcarona, and Gholdengo, respectively; in return, Slowbro deals with Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R. Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole cover other physical attackers such as Kartana, Meowscarada, and Weavile that Slowbro struggles with; the former two remove entry hazards with Defog in case Slowbro is forced to take a Knock Off, while the latter can make use of Future Sight to wallbreak easier.</p>"

Chansey can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy, especially since it can switch into status users like Clodsire and Rotom-W thanks to Natural Cure. However, Stealth Rock can be used if the team lacks another user, and Chansey can do it sufficiently by outlasting common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T. Tera Steel allows it to reliably check Tapu Lele, Hatterene, and Tornadus-T, and it prevents Chansey from being poisoned. Chansey is generally reserved for bulkier builds that appreciate its defensive profile and can tolerate its overall passivity. Sturdy walls like Skeledirge, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Corviknight can cover physical attackers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Kartana for Chansey. Skeledirge's Unaware helps against setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Charizard X that attempt to use Chansey as setup fodder, while Corviknight's Defog alleviates Chansey from entry hazard pressure that would overwhelm it easily. Knock Off and Trick absorbers like Clefable, Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo make sure that Chansey can keep its valuable Eviolite; Additionally, Mega Scizor helps deal with Psyshock Tapu Lele, Gholdengo threatens Calm Mind Hatterene, and Calm Mind Clefable overwhelms Heatran—especially if it's paralyzed—all of which are special attackers that can beat Chansey one-on-one.</p>"

Volt Switch allows Zapdos to freely pivot while doing very good damage, especially due to common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk being greatly threatened by Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for massive damage. Heat Wave is used to surprise Ferrothorn trying to come in on a Thunderbolt or Hurricane as well as consistently threaten Mega Scizor. Flyinium Z allows Zapdos to KO chipped defensive Pokemon that would otherwise be out of range of a Hurricane. If Zapdos is not using Flyinium Z, then it can Tera Flying for stronger Hurricanes. Pokemon like Iron Boulder appreciate offensive Zapdos, as it can rack up chip damage on Pokemon that would otherwise annoy Iron Boulder, such as Garganacl, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn. For rain teams, Zapdos can do good chunks of damage to Pokemon rain teams would otherwise struggle to break, such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Galarian Slowking can comfortably take any of Zapdos's moves, and then set up a Future Sight, threaten to poison with Sludge Bomb, or pivot out into an offensive check with Chilly Reception. However, if Galarian Slowking is predicted to switch in, then Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum, allowing Zapdos to switch into something that can threatens Galarian Slowking like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, or Gliscor. Bulky Pokemon that resist one of Zapdos's STAB moves and then threaten Zapdos, like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, can prove to be annoying.

It is a defogger that can threaten Gholdengo; a check to common Stealth Rock setters like Great Tusk, Heatran, and Garchomp; and a deterrent to contact attackers like U-turn users, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny. However, its main weakness lies in its overreliance on its Heavy-Duty Boots—although Tera could let it drop its weakness to Rock, Tera is usually better spent on other Pokemon, so Moltres still fears Knock Off from opponents it would otherwise check, like Iron Valiant, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Tera Water is used to ease the matchup against rain, becoming a check to common rain abusers like Basculegion-M, Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and threatening to burn them with Flame Body. Tera Ground instead grants a resistance to Stealth Rock and Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and an immunity to Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and Thunderbolt from Iron Valiant. Mystical Fire is chosen over Flamethrower, as its Special Attack drop is useful to more easily check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard Y, and Gholdengo. Scorching Sands is used to beat Heatran and also deter physical attackers looking to set up due to its high burn chance. Hurricane allows Moltres to OHKO Great Tusk and Mega Lopunny while heavily denting Volcarona and is useful in general as a powerful STAB option, U-turn allows Moltres to function as a pivot, pivoting out on foes like Heatran and Garganacl, and Toxic allows Moltres to punish Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp looking to soak up its STAB options. The given EVs allow Moltres to survive two Frustration from Mega Lopunny without Stealth Rock damage. However, there are still many opponents that can pressure Moltres, like Garganacl, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. Moltres thus pairs well with wallbreakers that can take advantage of such switch-ins to come in, like Tapu Lele or Iron Valiant. Moltres also dislikes having its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, so teammates that can absorb Knock Off are appreciated, including Mega Scizor and Gliscor.</p>"

Agility allows Galarian Moltres to outpace dangerous revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Kartana. However, Taunt is also a valuable alternative to Agility in order to shut down defensive checks like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Clodsire while also preventing common status spreaders like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran from limiting its sweep. Heavy-Duty Boots negates chip damage from entry hazards and allows Galarian Moltres to set up more reliably. Flyinium Z is used in order to quickly eliminate bulkier threats such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn without risking a miss due to Hurricane's poor accuracy; however, this leaves Galarian Moltres unable to Terastallize against threats such as Tapu Lele. Sitrus Berry is another option that lets Galarian Moltres maintain its health and trigger Berserk twice. Galarian Moltres is a great user of Terastallization, using Tera Steel to set up on its standard checks in Tapu Lele, Toxapex, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tera Steel also lets it resist many forms of priority including, but not limited to, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Weavile's Ice Shard, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. However, Galarian Moltres's new weaknesses mean that it has a harder time setting up on Mega Lopunny, Heatran, and Landorus-T while also being susceptible to other forms of priority like Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Galarian Moltres enjoys dual screens support to let it set up incredibly easily, so Tapu Koko makes for a great partner as both a solid pivot and dual screens setter. Galarian Moltres can struggle against threats such as Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar, so Mega Scizor and Hawlucha make for great partners to handle its checks offensively; in return, Galarian Moltres can break through Pokemon such as Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Gholdengo for them. Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta are also good partners that can check threats like Heatran, Kingambit, and Garganacl for Galarian Moltres.

Sand Tomb is an alternative option, allowing Mega Scizor to trap and KO Toxapex to the benefit of teammates such as Urshifu-R and Volcarona while retaining Mega Scizor's ability to deal with Heatran. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to avoid being 2HKOed by an unboosted Tapu Lele's Focus Blast after Stealth Rock while also outspeeding defensive Landorus-T. The ability that Close Combat Mega Scizor has to lure Heatran is greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Volcarona and Serperior, whereas Knock Off variants can permanently hinder Pokemon such as Volcarona and Zapdos to the benefit of teammates such as Iron Valiant and Kartana. Mega Scizor struggles to deal with Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Gouging Fire, and Zapdos, all of which can outspeed and threaten it with an OHKO or safely pivot around it, while Iron Defense Zamazenta is able to set up alongside Mega Scizor and beat it. Tapu Lele can also block Bullet Punch with its Psychic Terrain, negating a potential sweep. Teammates such as Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko are able to offensively check the Flying- and Water-type Pokemon that Mega Scizor struggles with, such as Zapdos and Toxapex. Raging Bolt able to check Mega Charizard Y and Ogerpon-W, whereas Tapu Koko overrides Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain with its own Electric Terrain. Rockium Z variants of Zamazenta can enable Mega Scizor to sweep by luring and removing Zapdos. Toxapex and Ferrothorn are able to defensively answer aformentioned Zamazenta, Volcarona, and Raging Bolt, which are able to set up in front of Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn specifically is able to set up entry hazards that heavily benefit Mega Scizor. Defog users such as Gliscor and Tornadus-T, are invaluable partners to Mega Scizor, due to its susceptibility to entry hazards and its inability to hold Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate this issue.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Kingdra is a potentially deadly wallbreaker on rain teams thanks to its brutally strong STAB moves as well as its respectable natural power that, when combined with Swift Swim, lets it claim KOs left and right, especially against offensive teams. It, however, faces significant challenges in trying to accomplish this; namely, its poor bulk and mediocre typing mean it is revenge killed rather easily if it predicts an opponent incorrectly or misses an attack. It is also easy to scout because of Choice Specs locking it into a move. Hydro Pump, when boosted by Tera Water and in rain, becomes nigh-unwallable, heavily denting even stopgaps like Ferrothorn and rendering attempts to scout Kingdra using Alomomola or Toxapex highly dangerous. Draco Meteor is the other of Kingdra's incredibly powerful STAB moves, crushing common switch-ins like the aforementioned Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, Toxapex, and Raging Bolt. Flip Turn lets Kingdra keep momentum against the bulkiest of special walls like Chansey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking that can take it on. Surf is a good mid-ground option that forgoes some immediate power for reliability, letting Kingdra revenge kill Pokemon like Iron Valiant in Rain while not having to worry about Hydro Pump's sometimes maddening accuracy. Pelipper is a must for Kingdra, as it is entirely unviable out of Rain. It also provides entry hazard control with Defog as well as a slow U-turn to give Kingdra the most chances at breaking through opposing teams with its breathtaking power. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T is a great partner for Kingdra, as it threatens the Grass-types that trouble it such as Ferrothorn and Rillaboom. In return, Kingdra helps to overload Steel-types like Heatran and Corviknight easily under rain, paving the way for other teammates. Zapdos is another option to take care of bulky Water-types more directly as well as check Rillaboom long-term. Mega Swampert is another great partner, as the two form a brilliant wallbreaking core that hit each other's checks: Draco Meteor crushes Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, while Mega Swampert beats special walls like Chansey thanks to its incredible physical power. Iron Treads is able to dictate the hazard game on rain teams by both setting Stealth Rock and by removing opposing hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Blissey's immense special bulk, useful utility moves, and reliable recovery allow it to function as a niche specially defensive pivot, as it checks threats such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Mega Charizard Y. Seismic Toss allows Blissey to pressure anything that isn't a Ghost-type with meaningful damage. Toxic is the preferred option to cripple Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Thunder Wave can also be used to annoy fast threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. It also allows Blissey to status Steel-types like Kingambit, Heatran, and Kartana. Teleport allows Blissey to safely pivot in teammates like Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Mega Medicham. However, Blissey is an acceptable Stealth Rock user if no other fits on your team. Shadow Ball can be considered as a niche option to break Dragapult's Substitutes and chip offensive Gholdengo, but it usually isn't worth dropping other moves. Tera Fairy gives Blissey a Fighting resistance in exchange for negligible Poison and Steel weaknesses, and it reduces the damage it takes from Pursuit users like Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. This should be used if Blissey absolutely has to take on a Fighting- or Dark-type like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, or Weavile. Blissey's defensive profile makes it a liability into certain Ghost-types, specifically Dragon Dance Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit is a great option that deals with the former two threats while also benefitting from Blissey bringing it in safely with Teleport. Other wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Medicham also appreciate pivot support and benefit from Blissey spreading Thunder Wave. A switch-in to powerful physical attackers, like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Kingambit, is necessary. Options like Toxapex, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Great Tusk can help out on this front. Knock Off is irritating for Blissey, as losing its Heavy-Duty Boots is quite detrimental to its pivoting efforts. Options such as Flyinium Z Tornadus-T and Gliscor can help out in this regard.</p>"

Knock Off allows Mega Tyranitar to remove items from switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk, greatly impeding their longevity. Pursuit lets Mega Tyranitar threaten to trap and remove foes such as Tapu Lele Choice locked into Psychic, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Additionally, the threat of Pursuit forces foes like the Tapu Lele to play quite predictably, easing the burden for teammates such as Galarian Slowking not having to fear Psychic-type attacks lest they be trapped by Mega Tyranitar. A solid matchup into common Defoggers like Zapdos and Moltres allows Mega Tyranitar to proficiently set up Stealth Rock, while Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows its own entry hazards to incur damage easier. The given Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Rotom-W. Iron Valiant is an incredible teammate for Mega Tyranitar, as Mega Tyranitar can trap and inflict heavy damage or outright remove Clodsire and Galarian Slowking, which are two of the biggest roadblocks for Iron Valiant. Defensively, Alomomola is very common teammate, as it can keep Mega Tyranitar healthy with Wish + Flip Turn and sponge attacks from Fighting-types it fears such as Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk. Gliscor can give Mega Tyranitar trouble, as once its Toxic Orb has been activated, it can switch in consistently without fearing the item loss of Knock Off while clearing Stealth Rock with Defog, so Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W are good teammates to assist combatting it.</p>"

Its immunity to Electric-type moves is greatly appreciated for rain teams, which can struggle with common Electric-types in the tier such as Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Flip Turn allows it to maintain momentum against checks like Rotom-W and Alomomola while wearing them down. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Dragonite, Serperior, and Mega Latias that would check Mega Swampert otherwise. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of forced switches on Pokemon such as Garganacl and Galarian Slowking, as well as free up a slot for a teammate like Ferrothorn to run Spikes over Stealth Rock. Superpower is another option, which hits checks such as Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Ogerpon-W. As the premier rain setter in the tier, Pelipper is a mandatory teammate for Mega Swampert, being able to grant it free switches with its ability to act as a slow pivot with U-turn. Ferrothorn is another especially good teammate for Mega Swampert for its ability to switch into the defensive Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble dealing with such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and Rotom-W as well as Ogerpon-W lacking Superpower, and it can also make progress by setting hazards and forcing switches against these foes. Ferrothorn is also able to remove items like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, letting Mega Swampert attack more freely, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Alomomola, making them more easily worn down by hazards. Mega Swampert can also struggle against Grass-types such as Kartana and Rillaboom, which makes Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T great teammates for their ability to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Swampert also appreciates other Swift Swim users such as Barraskewda as teammates, being able to wear down each others' shared checks such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Archaludon is a good partner, being able to check Grass- and Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble with such as Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior. In return, Mega Swampert threatens Ground-types that Archaludon struggles with like Landorus-T and Gliscor.</p>"

Its decent physical bulk alongside Scald lets Pelipper check and threaten to cripple popular offensive presences like Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny, as well as Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran. Roost keeps Pelipper healthy throughout the course of the game, enabling consistent rain and better longevity against threats such as Urshifu-R. Hurricane can be used to hit foes such as Urshifu-R, Tera Grass Heatran, and most notably, Ogerpon-W, for super effective damage, while Defog is an alternative that removes entry hazards if common partners in Tornadus-T or Zapdos lack it. Tera Ground is used to change Pelipper's 4x weakness to Electric into an immunity to potentially absorb Volt Switch from Tapu Koko or Rotom-W and pivot out. Pokemon that need rain to boost their strength and Speed such as Mega Swampert, Barrsekwda, Battle Bond Greninja, and Urshifu-R are great partners for Pelipper. They particularly appreciate Pelipper being able to bring them onto the field safely and often into a winning position via a slow U-turn. Mega Swampert also serves as a bulky Electric-immune Pokemon that can check Tapu Koko for Pelipper. Other pokemons like Zapdos and Tornadus-T also benefit from the rain Pelipper sets up and can act both as excellent wallbreakers or entry hazard removers. Furthermore, Ferrothorn and Archaludon can take advantage of Pelipper's typing defensively, with the latter's signature move in Electro Shot pairing especially well with rain.</p>"

Knock Off provides coverage against Fairy-resistant foes such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn, annihilating them after a boost, and severely cripples Heatran. Sucker Punch makes up for Mega Mawile’s poor Speed tier, preventing it from being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Volcarona, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. The given EV spread allows Mega Mawile to outspeed uninvested Corviknight. Intimidate is the chosen ability prior to Mega Evolving, letting Mega Mawile set up on physical attackers like Weavile and Rillaboom more easily. Mega Mawile appreciates being brought in safely via slow pivots such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Alomomola due to its mediocre bulk. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Landorus-T synergize well with Mega Mawile, as they wear down its checks like Heatran and Garchomp into range of a boosted Sucker Punch. Mega Mawile is prone to being revenge killed if its offensive checks aren't weakened, so it pairs well with a sturdy defensive core, such as Toxapex, Gliscor, and Rotom-W. These Pokemon also handle the Fire- and Ground-types that Mega Mawile is most susceptible to, such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Landorus-T.

Fire Fang destroys Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Iron Crown, and Ferrothorn, that otherwise shrug Mega Mawile’s attacks off. Knock Off specifically hits Galarian Slowking while also crippling Heatran and Volcarona. Lastly, Focus Punch can be used to completely break through Skarmory while still hitting the aforementioned Steel-types, but it is extremely prediction reliant. The given EV spread allows Mega Mawile to outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor. Intimidate is the chosen ability prior to Mega Evolving, letting Mega Mawile sponge hits from physical attackers like Weavile and Rillaboom more easily. Mega Mawile works best with late-game cleaners that appreciate it punching holes in opposing teams early on, so Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Choice Scarf Kartana are amazing partners. Pivots such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Galarian Slowking also work well to safely bring Mega Mawile in throughout the match. Tapu Koko in particular also boosts Mega Mawile’s Thunder Punch damage, letting it pressure Toxapex and Corviknight harder.

It can also switch into status and Fighting-type moves and threaten an Encore or gain momentum against Pokemon such as Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Swords Dance Gliscor, as well as Zamazenta's Close Combat. Mega Banette is no slouch when it comes to offensive power either, as it's able to use its gargantuan Attack stat in combination with Poltergeist to deal immense damage to a majority of the metagame, picking up 2HKOs on most switch-ins that don't resist or aren't immune to Ghost, such as Ferrothorn, physically defensive Zapdos, and specially defensive Corviknight. Destiny Bond allows Mega Banette to force a trade even once it's threatened out, being able to deal with fast threats without priority moves like Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf users like Urshifu-S and Tapu Lele, or setup sweepers that have gotten out of hand such as Swords Dance Iron Boulder and Nasty Plot Darkrai. However, Mega Banette requires a large commitment from its teammates to be able to function, relying on them consistently bringing it in to make the most use of its supportive capabilities due to its lackluster bulk.

Psychic hits Zamazenta harder and has good neutral coverage, but Psyshock can also be used hit harder against Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Ogerpon-W when Terastallized. Aura Sphere complements Mega Latias well, hitting Dark- and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar.

Stored Power is another option that allows Mega Latias to boost past Unaware users such as Dondozo and Clefable while also becoming almost impossible to take on defensively after a few boosts. Aura Sphere hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Ferrothorn, all of which would otherwise either completely wall it or remove it with Pursuit. Substitute is another option that allows Mega Latias to avoid status moves that would harm it greatly from the likes of Gliscor, Alomomola, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking while also taking advantage of Pokemon that are unable to touch it such as Garganacl and Rotom-W. It is recommended that Substitute is always paired with Stored Power and vice versa, as Substitute allows Mega Latias to stack more Calm Mind boosts and make Stored Power much more impending against bulkier teams. Due to Mega Latias needing multiple Calm Mind boosts to be threatening, it can be offensively exploited by Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant, which can prevent it from setting up by offensively pressuring it. As such, checks to them like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Zamazenta are good partners.

        "description": "<p>With its 100/100/100 bulk, good defensive typing, and passable offensive stats, Jirachi can function as a Z-Happy Hour sweeper, utilizing the omniboost to its full potential. Stored Power is Jirachi's main attacking move, nailing most foes that do not resist Psychic&amp;emdash;this also allows Jirachi to match up favorably against Toxapex and Clodsire, the two biggest setup stoppers in the tier. Aura Sphere allows Jirachi to deal with Dark- and Steel-types; these include Hisuian Samurott, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. Drain Punch is an alternative to 2HKO Blissey, which otherwise walls Jirachi, and keep itself healthy with recovery when fighting foes like Heatran. Iron Head serves as a secondary STAB move that can also flinch down foes like Galarian Slowking and Dragonite. A Naive nature should be run when using Drain Punch over Aura Sphere. Jirachi pairs well with allies that can take out its main checks, since it can only set up once and thus has to make it count. Magnezone and Heatran are stellar partners, trapping foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl that may stand in the way of a Jirachi sweep. Offensive Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Garchomp that may struggle against Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant pair well with Jirachi, as it acts as a soft check to these foes and can use them as setup fodder. Tapu Lele is also notable for providing Psychic Terrain that blocks priority such as Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and powers up Stored Power. Finally, dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Grimmsnarl is beneficial to ease Jirachi's setup, as the damage reduction affords Jirachi more opportunities to successfully use Z-Happy Hour.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Sporting its infamous Serene Grace-boosted Iron Head in conjunction with a good defensive profile, decent Speed, and a wide utility movepool, Jirachi carves itself a niche as a Choice Scarf user. Iron Head allows Jirachi to easily revenge kill Fairy- and Ice-types, such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Weavile, and has good odds to flinch down any foe that does not resist Steel, as long as they are sufficiently chipped. U-turn allows Jirachi to pivot out into teammates upon forcing out foes, allowing free points of entry for allies such as Ogerpon-W and Zapdos that capitalize on Jirachi's switch-ins in Heatran and Toxapex. Trick cripples most foes that try to switch into Iron Head; foes like Toxapex, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Alomomola dislike being locked into a move. Healing Wish gives weakened allies another chance to sweep, additionally curing status like burn and paralysis and offering a point of entry; it is best used on offensive Pokemon, such that they can be used more recklessly early-game and come back later to sweep. Ice Punch alternatively allows Jirachi to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Garchomp particularly hard. Jirachi is best used on offensive playstyles that appreciate its one-off heal and ability to cripple defensive switch-ins. Since Jirachi acts as a soft check to the tier's premier Fairy-types in Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, allies like Zamazenta and Weavile that dislike them pair well with it, as they can threaten Jirachi's checks in Heatran, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Slowbro. Jirachi also struggles to revenge kill Mega Gyarados, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Scizor, especially once they set up, so allies like Ferrothorn and Corviknight are needed to act as sturdier checks. Finally, Jirachi is easily exploited by foes like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Scizor, and Garchomp, as all of them can switch into Iron Head and can ignore Trick provided the latter has a Z-Crystal. Allies that can take advantage of them such as Tapu Koko, Iron Moth, and Weavile make for good partners.</p>"

Low Kick hits Ferrothorn and Ice Spinner hits Dragapult and Dragonite more reliably. However, because of Tera Water, its Water-type moves are all boosted considerably, so coverage is often unnecessary. Aqua Jet gives Floatzel priority outside of rain against weakened targets such as Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny, and it bypasses Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tornadus-T and Zapdos all appreciate Floatzel's offensive capabilities, as it deals with wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Mega Diancie, Gholdengo, Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Valiant. Zapdos can reliably check Water-types that counter Floatzel like Slowbro and Dondozo. Tornadus-T can weaken and cripple Floatzel checks in Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Ferrothorn, as Knock Off removes Leftovers from them, making it easier for Floatzel to wallbreak. Offensive partners like Manaphy and Mega Swampert can overwhelm those same Water-resistant Pokemon as well as Dragonite. Ferrothorn can check priority users such as the aforementioned Dragonite and Kingambit, alleviating Floatzel's weakness to them.</p>"

Scald lets Gastrodon threaten a burn against otherwise safe switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Dragonite. Toxic better threatens defensive Pokemon such as opposing Gastrodon, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. Earthquake threatens Pokemon like Heatran, Clodsire, and Gholdengo. Relaxed should be selected as Gastrodon's nature if using Earthquake to not lower its damage output; Bold should be used otherwise. Tera Fairy can be used in a pinch to grant Gastrodon a resistance to Fighting against Urshifu-R and Barraskweda and a Dark resistance against Kingambit. The given EV spread maximizes Gastrodon's physical bulk to better take on the likes of Floatzel, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Gastrodon fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its defensive qualities while being able to supplement its passivity with offensive wallbreakers. Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Gholdengo can switch into Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Kartana and Ferrothorn; In return, Gastrodon provides entry hazard support to wear down answers such as Mega Tyranitar, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Strong, fast wallbreakers like Mega Diancie, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta love having Gastrodon as a fallback measure against the myriad of Water-type revenge killers on rain such as Floatzel and Mega Swampert. If Gastrodon opts to use Spikes, it likes having Stealth Rock setters such as Heatran and Mega Diancie as partners to form an effective entry hazard-stacking core.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Lopunny is one of the best offensive pivots in the metagame and can function as great speed control due to its high Attack and Speed, its unresisted STAB move combination with Scrappy, and U-turn. It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon except for Zamazenta, allowing it to pressure fast foes like Darkrai, Weavile, and Ogerpon-W. Fake Out puts many foes like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Ogerpon-W into the range of an OHKO, and it can stop setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth after they're weakened or by sacrificing teammates to allow Mega Lopunny to use Fake Out multiple times. U-turn enables Mega Lopunny to pivot out on checks like Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Toxapex, while Quick Attack allows it to pick off weakened setup sweepers when paired with Fake Out; especially when they manage to reach a sweeping position. Teammates like Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Hisuian Samurott benefit from Mega Lopunny threatening Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Raging Bolt especially appreciates Mega Lopunny bringing it in against walls like Alomomola and Corviknight, while Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge to chip foes like Great Tusk for Mega Lopunny. Teammates with Future Sight support like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown also pair well with Mega Lopunny, making it easier to break through foes like Toxapex. Mega Lopunny can be annoyed by Rocky Helmet on Landorus-T, Static users like Zapdos, and Flame Body users like Volcarona, so Knock Off support from Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Landorus-T, as well as partners that can threaten them, like Ogerpon-W, are greatly appreciated. Mega Lopunny switches in frequently due to its role, which makes it naturally weak to entry hazards, meaning it benefits from teammates like Landorus-T and Rotom-W that can clear them. Mega Lopunny also appreciates entry hazards from its teammates like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Hisuian Samurott, since it forces many switches and can easily clean weakened foes.</p>"

Garchomp's positive matchup versus the latter three in turn allow it to set and maintain Stealth Rock very well. Additionally, Garchomp’s solid natural bulk and good typing lets it find opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Iron Moth. Outrage with Dragonium Z gives Garchomp a stronger option that can notably OHKO Landorus-T at +1 while also OHKOing Great Tusk and Zapdos at +2. However, the Z-Move can require prediction if the opponent has a Fairy-type lest Garchomp become trapped into Outrage and easily revenge killed by foes such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. In comparison, Stone Edge bolstered by Rockium Z provides a more consistent attack for Garchomp outside of its Z-Move while hitting foes such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight harder than its Dragon-type Z-Move counterpart. Offensive teammates who can exploit the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Dragonite are appreciated, while teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ferrothorn give Garchomp a solid option to fall back on in the face of revenge killers such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"

      "TankChomp": {
        "description": "<p>Tank Garchomp maximizes the value of its ability and great movepool to check Hisuian Samurott, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Boulder. Garchomp aims to punish physical attackers and force progression with entry hazards and Toxic. Dragon Tail lets Garchomp make the most of entry hazards laid by itself or teammates, being able to force foes to take damage at random if they lack Heavy-Duty Boots. Additionally, it can also be used to deny setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Iron Boulder, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type STAB move. Garchomp can effectively lay both Stealth Rock and Spikes due to a positive matchup versus common hazard removal options such as Zapdos and Rotom-W while also dissuading Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin, as it will take serious chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Toxic is another way to avoid passivity; it can be used to wear down foes such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Tera Ghost is best used for deny Rapid Spin or to change its typing to survive other wise super effective hits such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Mega Medicham's Ice Punch. 56 Speed EVs are enough to outrun Modest Heatran. Mega Tyranitar is a solid partner, being able to remove Landorus-T and Great Tusk's Leftovers with Knock Off, which allows Garchomp to wear them down more easily with Toxic and Rough Skin in tandem with Rocky Helmet. Mega Tyranitar can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Alomomola and certain variants of Great Tusk, letting Garchomp's entry hazards rack up more damage. Garchomp really appreciates Alomomola’s Wish passing because it lacks a source of recovery. Garchomp's matchups against other Defoggers such as Corviknight, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T make it hard to keep hazards up at times, so teammates that can help with these Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are appreciated alongside it. Galarian Slowking proves very useful to Garchomp because of its ability to check common Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, which usually force out Garchomp. Galarian Slowking also invites in many Pokémon that can give Garchomp an opportunity to get up Spikes such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Iron Boulder.</p>"

Tera Steel grants it the ability to ignore Toxic and set up on passive foes like Alomomola and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Fire gives Fire Fang a STAB boost and allows Garchomp to become immune to burn from foes like Rotom-W and Moltres. Both Tera types flip the match up against Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, both of which can heavily threaten hyper offense teams which Loaded Dice Garchomp mostly finds itself on. Teammates like Volcarona, Raging Bolt, and Urshifu-R appreciate Garchomp threatening foes like Dragonite, Clodsire and Toxapex. Garchomp requires support to set up and sweep due to its typing and Defense drops from Scale Shot, so it is very helpful to have dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl. It also struggles against common threats like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Weavile, which makes Mega Scizor and Iron Valiant good partners with it. Landorus-T can pivot around Garchomp pretty easily, which makes Mega Scizor a good teammate since it can frequently force Landorus-T in and wear it down. Unaware users like Dondozo can completely shut down Garchomp, so it benefits a lot from immediate breaking power from teammates like Raging Bolt and Tapu Lele, the latter of which can also protect it from priority moves.</p>"

It can find plenty of time to set up Stealth Rock and spread chip damage with Toxic and its ability Sand Stream. Sand Stream also allows Hippowdon to disrupt opposing weather, which is bolstered by its positive matchup against every other weather setter. Toxic notably nets a ton of chip damage on Defoggers attempting to get rid of Hippowdon's Stealth Rock and Ground-Immune Pokemon switching into Earthquake, such as Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y. Hippowdon can Terastallize into the Steel typing to avoid Toxic in addition to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks while maintaining its sand immunity and Stealth Rock resistance. Even beyond the simple type matchup chart changes, it allows Hippowdon to more easily check its targets such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie. Maximum Special Defense EVs are ran due to Hippowdon having more valuable special targets than physical, namely the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T appreciate Hippowdon's presence, as it checks both Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zapdos while setting up Stealth Rock to help wear down their checks. Defensively, Hippowdon supports Pokemon such as Garganacl and Skarmory; Garganacl appreciates the sand and its attached benefits and Skarmory appreciates the sturdy Ground-type anchor and special wall. Hippowdon struggles to fend off strong physical attackers like Kingambit, Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados. For this reason, it pairs exquisitely with strong physical walls such as Skarmory and Buzzwole.

Knock Off provides further utility by crippling switch-ins like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Heatran, and it hits Dragapult and Gholdengo super effectively. Hidden Power Fire pressures Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor—the former of which can use Tangrowth as setup fodder otherwise—while Hidden Power Ice dents Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Earthquake is an option to threaten Steel-types hard, including Heatran, as well as Tapu Koko and Clodsire. Stun Spore or Sleep Powder cripples foes like Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant, preventing Tangrowth from being taken advantage of by them, especially if not running the appropriate coverage move. Nature Power—if paired with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain—immediately pressures Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Rocky Helmet chips down the physical attackers that Tangrowth checks, especially pivot attempts from the likes of Mega Swampert and Landorus-T, but Heavy-Duty Boots makes it a sturdier pivot in the face of entry hazards. Tera Steel improves Tangrowth's matchup against foes like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and non-Close Combat Mega Scizor, and it prevents it from being crippled by Toxapex, Clodsire, and Glimmora's poison.

Focus Blast can also be used to snipe  Kingambit, or even Rock Slide to remove unsuspecting Volcarona that try to set up on the switch—the effectiveness of both options are highly matchup dependent, however. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground- and Dragon-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Gliscor, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Tera Steel is preferred to turn Tangrowth's common weaknesses into resistances, helping it sponge Ice coverage from Weavile, Baxcalibur, and Mega Swampert and Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Moreover, it can be used in a pinch to resist Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Tera Water turns the tide against threats such as Weavile and Heatran while maintaining Tangrowth's ability to check rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Heatran receives strong support from Tangrowth, as Tangrowth checks threats such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and pivots into foes with super effective coverage against Heatran, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. In return, Heatran checks Weavile, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T. Toxapex and Tornadus-T both benefit from Tangrowth's ability to pivot into threats such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W, with the former receiving the same level of support from Tangrowth as does Heatran. This trio comprises a formidable Regenerator core, with Toxapex removing Toxic Spikes and checking Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Weavile, and Tornadus-T providing valuable entry hazard removal to reinforce the longevity of the core. Tangrowth is susceptible to entry hazards, which can often put it into 2HKO range of certain attacks; therefore, it appreciates entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tornadus-T, as well as Rotom-W. Defensive cores supported by Tangrowth can fall victim to Kyurem as a result of its lethal coverage. Volcarona and Mega Scizor are teammates that can take advantage of Kyurem with their ability to set up and reliable recovery. With Tornadus-T forcing Tangrowth out, Rotom-W and Tapu Koko make for stellar teammates with their resistance to Hurricane and ability to pivot.

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Rotom-W provides a unique blend of defensive utility and wallbreaking potential thanks to its great combination of typing and ability in addition to its versatile move pool. Discharge has a chance to paralyze and cripple bulky switch-ins like Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Dragonite. Substitute keeps Rotom-W safe from status moves like Toxic and generates free turns for it to set up, turning many common utility Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Heatran into Rotom-W's setup fodder. Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative combination, the former helping Rotom-W keep up the momentum and the latter helping to cripple threats such as Dragonite and Garchomp. However, this combination is less effective for wallbreaking because it makes Rotom-W vulnerable to status moves and forces it to switch out if it needs to use its Electric-type STAB move, losing the boost from Nasty Plot. Tera Ghost combined with Levitate counters several popular Ground-type threats like Ursaluna, Sword Dance Gliscor, and Great Tusk, while Tera Steel and Tera Poison complement Levitate well and let Rotom-W effectively wall utility variants of Gliscor, the former improving its matchup into Tapu Lele and the latter granting it a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Urshifu-R. 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T so it can set up Substitute first and dodge Toxic, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into bulk so it can check the aforementioned physical threats better. With most Rotom-W sets being pure utility, this set can often come across as a surprise to the would-be bulky checks to it such as Clefable, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking, and it can also disrupt the opponent's pace by setting up Substitute and boost with Nasty Plot. However, both of its STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types and Dragon-types, which means it loses to the likes of Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt even after boosting. Serperior and Kyurem especially prey on this set because they both can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Specially Defensive Heatran is a cornerstone of the metagame, being able to check top special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Volcarona, and Serperior while also remaining a threatening offensive Pokemon. Toxic is valuable on Heatran to wear down Pokemon that can either check it or set up in front of it, such as Alomomola, Rotom-W, Mega Latias, Raging Bolt and Volcarona, whereas Stealth Rock takes advantage of Heatran's ability to act as a blanket check to most special attackers in the tier. In addition, many defensive staples such as Galarian Slowking, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Tornadus-T are forced to switch out of Heatran in fear of Toxic or Magma Storm, and it can also threaten many common Defoggers such as Zapdos and Corviknight, affording it many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Taunt is a powerful option to deny setup from the likes of Mega Latias, which could otherwise set up and eventually muscle past Heatran, while also being extremely synergistic with Heatran's other moves; in combination with Magma Storm, Heatran is able to trap pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Zapdos lacking Volt Switch, denying their recovery and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception. Additionaly, when paired with Toxic it is able to wear down Alomomola, which is otherwise a major roadblock for Heatran, and allows Heatran to beat it in the long run. Tera Grass provides Heatran with a resistance to Water- and Ground-Type attacks, allowing Heatran to wall Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona variants lacking Bug Buzz while also checking Ogerpon-W, additionally allowing Heatran to trap Gliscor if using Taunt and an alternative spread of 252 HP / 108 SpD / 148 Spe, which allows Heatran to outspeed Gliscor. Heatran is a powerful addition to most defensive structures thanks to its ability to check many special attackers such as Volcarona, Serperior, Mega Latios, and Tapu Lele, whereas its ability to trap Galarian Slowking and Toxapex is greatly appreciated by teammates such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona. Due to lacking both reliable recovery and an immunity to Spikes, Heatran is extremely vulnerable to hazards, and is prone to being worn down during longer battles, thus Alomomola is a powerful boon to Heatran's longevity, allowing it to remain healthy throughout a prolonged match, and is also an exceptional pivot, allowing Heatran to switch in on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex that commonly switch into Alomomola, providing Heatran with more opportunities to set up Stealth Rock or wear down the opposing team with Magma Storm and Toxic. Pokemon such as Zapdos, Gliscor, and Ferrothorn are able to check Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, opposing Gliscor, and Ogerpon-W that Heatran struggles to deal with; the former two also utilize Defog to aid in Heatran's longevity, while the latter is able to set up Spikes to further capitalize on the many switches that Heatran forces.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Cresselia serves as a potentially terrifying setup sweeper, using its naturally titanic mixed bulk alongside Terastallization to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts, bolstering its Stored Power to incredibly dangerous levels to easily snowball if given the opportunity. Even without Terastallization, it can use its natural typing to withstand attacks from dangerous Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Mega Medicham. Hidden Power Fighting is the preferred coverage move to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran much harder, while Moonblast provides a stronger hit against the likes of Dragapult and Urshifu-R if Cresselia cannot afford to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts. Tera Poison is essential for removing Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Samurott while providing less exploitable weaknesses compared to Tera Steel, which makes Cresselia prone to being revenge killed by Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sneasler, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Covert Cloak allows Cresselia to negate secondary effects from Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from the likes of Toxapex, Sneasler, and Zapdos, while Leftovers provides passive recovery that makes Cresselia less exploitable and forced to heal. Maximum Speed EVs allow Cresselia to consistently outspeed Heatran and Gholdengo, which could otherwise irritate it, although more Defense investment could be used instead to better withstand attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Cresselia fits best on either bulky balance or hyper offense teams, both able to provide support in different ways; the former give Cresselia a defensive core to fall back on should its sweep fail, while the latter pressure opposing defensive teams and can provide dual screens support via Tapu Koko and Dragapult to bolster its bulk even further. Both playstyles can reliably keep up Spikes using Skarmory, Clodsire, Mega Diancie, or Garchomp, which Cresselia mandates in order to wear down its checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Similarly, Knock Off support from the likes of Toxapex and Iron Valiant helps Cresselia pressure the aforementioned checks more effectively. Cresselia has difficulty withstanding rain teams due to them cutting Moonlight's healing, so defensive partners that match up positively against them such as Toxapex and Tera Water or Dragon Garganacl are appreciated. Cresselia struggles with bulkier playstyles that can neutralize it with the likes of Haze Toxapex and Unaware Tera Dark Clodsire, so Pokemon that can break defensive teams such as Swords Dance Gliscor and Gholdengo make for good partners.</p>"

Other special wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Raging Bolt, and Iron Valiant appreciate Darkrai's ability to weaken or KO special walls such as Heatran or Gliscor. Darkrai is liable to being outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Booster Energy Iron Boulder, Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, so a strong defensive backbone with Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Heatran is heavily recommended.</p>"

U-turn is useful to pivot out of checks that shrug off V-create like Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T, although Victini should be wary of Rocky Helmet on the latter. Trick is used to cripple tanks like Garganacl and Slowbro, reducing their longevity while receiving Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers in return. V-create's explosive power needs little Attack investment to perform effectively, still easily 2HKOing most neutral targets including defensive Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Thus, 248 HP EVs are instead used to maximize the potential of Final Gambit while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock. Tera Fire is used to fuel V-create, notably OHKOing Tornadus-T, and remove Victini’s weakness to Pursuit, but this comes at the cost of a comparably worse defensive typing against foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Victini's ability to threaten any foe allows it to very easily pivot into wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, which appreciate having annoying defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex crippled or removed with Trick or Final Gambit. Setup sweepers also benefit greatly from Victini's presence, as it can surprise and KO defensive threats that would otherwise impede their progress; allies like Mega Medicham and Garchomp enjoy having threats like Gliscor and Landorus-T removed, and the clean field left after Victini KOes itself also affords them a free point of entry. However, Victini must be kept as healthy as possible to ensure that Final Gambit can OHKO what it needs to. Thus, allies that can soak up Water- and Ground-type moves like Gastrodon and Rotom-W make for valuable partners. Entry hazard removal from allies like Zapdos is also useful to ensure hazards do not hamper Victini’s effectiveness.</p>"

      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<p>Victini is a potent user of Z-Celebrate, as its already decent natural bulk and typing greatly appreciate the defensive boosts, not to mention the offensive power gained. STAB-boosted Stored Power easily 2HKOes many defensive foes like Gliscor and even Unaware users including Clodsire and Skeledirge. Searing Shot is another STAB option to target Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast allows Victini to target pesky Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu along with Heatran, with its low accuracy somewhat offset by Victory Star. Victini can leverage its bulk to set up on many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, and its buff after omniboosting lets it survive super effective moves from more passive enemies like Gliscor, making it a perfect fit on hyper offense. It is also naturally resistant to priority moves like Bullet Punch from Scizor, Vacuum Wave from Iron Valiant, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Z-Celebrate Victini pairs well with entry hazard suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as their Stealth Rock and potentially Spikes support is invaluable; with Stealth Rock, an OHKO on Tera Water Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W are near guaranteed; Stealth Rock also notably breaks Ogerpon-C’s Sturdy along with stray Focus Sashes. Victini also appreciates teammates like Close Combat Iron Valiant luring Blissey and Tera Dark Clodsire, and they also help soften up Ting-Lu for Victini. Tapu Lele is another useful ally that can boost Stored Power with its summoned Psychic Terrain, which also prevents priority including Mega Lopunny’s Fake Out and Hisuian Samurott’s Sucker Punch for a limited time. After Victini heavily weakens foes and potentially forces them to Terastallize, Tapu Lele can also clean up, since any remaining Psychic-resistant foes would be heavily chipped.</p>"

Instead, Victini makes explosive use of each opportunity it gets to blast through foes with V-create, leaving a massive dent in many defensive cores once it manages to pivot in. Bolt Strike is used for coverage, targeting Water-types like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Toxapex. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of bad matchups like Great Tusk and Rotom-W or after using V-create, pivoting in teammates to help it wallbreak. Encore can lock greedy setup sweepers like Gliscor and Garganacl into moves like Swords Dance or Iron Defense, allowing Victini to give its ally a free switch in or simply hit something hard with V-create. Toxic is an alternative to wear down defensive threats like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T into range of Victini or an ally and also cripple other switch-ins like Garchomp and Dragonite. Tera Fire cranks up the power of V-create, turning Victini into a wallbreaker capable of scorching most neutral targets for a 2HKO, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Ting-Lu, and also notably OHKOing Tornadus-T. However, it then loses valuable resistances to Fighting- and Psychic-type moves, leaving it unable to check Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham after Tera. Victini suits bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression both offensively and defensively. Wallbreakers like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y all appreciate Victini's ability to give them free points of entry with U-turn, and the latter also boosts V-create with sun. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, as well as its weakness to Knock Off and Pursuit in general, Victini appreciates having teammates that can beat Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile; Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny are good partners to check them and in the latter's case also absorb Knock Off. Victini is also vulnerable to Water-type moves from the likes of Mega Swampert and Basculegion especially when they are in rain, so allies that can soak up these moves like Gastrodon and Ferrothorn are good partners. In return, Victini takes Grass- and Fire-type moves for them, respectively. Finally, Tornadus-T, Landorus-T and Gliscor can help switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and in return Victini tanks Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem for them.</p>"

It has decent natural bulk and a useful defensive typing that helps it find opportunities to switch in and set up against foes like Gliscor and Ogerpon-W. Hidden Power Fire is its most important coverage move for foes like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Iron Crown, all of which could stop Serperior otherwise even after several boosts. Glare provides excellent utility by crippling would-be checks such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Volcarona with paralysis. Substitute, when paired with Glare and passive recovery from Leftovers, enables Serperior to fish for full paralysis and set up against more passive foes like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking, and it can even stall out Heatran's Magma Storm PP. The combination of Glare and Substitute often forces faster revenge killers like Zamazenta and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele to accept paralysis if they want to break Serperior's Substitute. Leech Seed is an alternative that enables Serperior to beat threats like Heatran on its own. Tera Steel is a wonderful defensive choice that helps against the likes of Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, and it completely shuts down walls like Galarian Slowking alongside Substitute. 56 HP EVs make sure that Serperior can keep its Substitute from being broken by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip. Tera Blast with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and Tera Ground can be chosen over Substitute to hit foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Rock trades Serperior's ability to break past Heatran and Galarian Slowking to beat Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T. Wallbreakers that benefits from speed control like Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham appreciate Serperior paralyzing faster foes like Darkrai, Tornadus-T, and Iron Valiant with Glare. Specially defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking can give Serperior a hard time, especially when it's unable to Terastallize, so it is very helpful to have teammates like Landorus-T that can threaten them. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can both provide Pursuit support for Serperior to pressure Galarian Slowking and Mega Latios, and both of them can also threaten foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T.</p>"

Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to remove items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots users like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Alomomola. Flip Turn allows for pivoting while doing decent STAB damage. Sacred Sword allows Hisuian Samurott to 2HKO Ferrothorn and OHKO Mega Lopunny, Darkrai, and Mega Tyranitar. Tera Water lets Hisuian Samurott 2HKO defensive Zapdos and OHKO Mega Medicham most of the time. Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Tapu Lele. Tera Poison is an alternative choice, providing a resistance to Fighting-type coverage from Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Mega Lopunny, Fairy-type coverage from Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, and U-turn from foes such as Landorus-T. Wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Urshifu-R appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to chip foes with Ceaseless Edge. Other Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Gliscor are able to run different moves, as Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes itself. Hisuian Samurott is very frail, and it can have trouble switching in safely, so have pivots that can help with this, such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, Tapu Koko, and Alomomola.

Protective Pads lets Hisuian Samurott avoid contact effects from Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Moltres which could otherwise stop or significantly hinder its ability to wallbreak. Tera Dark further amplifies the power of Hisuian Samurott's Dark-type STAB attacks, allowing it to OHKO targets like Mega Medicham with Sucker Punch without Black Glasses while dealing massive damage to defensive cores which could otherwise shrug off Ceaseless Edge even while boosted, such as Zapdos and Skarmory. Alternatively, Tera Poison provides a useful defensive typing that can turn the tables on foes such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, as well as deny Toxic from Alomomola and turn it into setup fodder. Offensive teams that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to punch holes in opposing defensive structures while laying Spikes to help them break such as Kartana, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele make for good teammates. Defensive teams featuring Dondozo have no trouble with taking boosted Ceaseless Edge, so Tapu Koko and Ferrothorn are good teammates to help with this weakness. These two also assist with ensuring Alomomola and Toxapex are no problem for Hisuian Samurott, since they can otherwise threaten with a potential Toxic or Scald. Additionally, opposing offensive teams can make it hard for Hisuian Samurott to find its footing due to its middling Speed stat, so Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can assist in these matchups while appreciating the Spikes set versus more balanced styles. Teammates who effectively use Knock Off such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Ferrothorn are great teammates as they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Toxapex, making them more susceptible to the Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge.</p>"

It pairs well with the main sun setter, Mega Charizard Y, as it can switch into and threaten Mega Charizard Y’s checks such as Hippowdon, Heatran, and Clodsire; in return, Mega Charizard Y beats its checks like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor, if Hisuian Lilligant lacks Tera Blast. Solar Blade is used for raw power, although Leaf Blade is still an option for consistency outside sun. Tera Blast Fire, especially in sun, gives Lilligant a powerful third STAB option to punish foes that can tank its original STAB combination like Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Tera Poison Cresselia. Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p>"

      "Hustle Breaker": {
        "description": "<p>Hustle coupled with Victory Dance can be used to break common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus, Kingambit, and Heatran; Hisuian Lilligant also outspeeds a good portion of the metagame after a Victory Dance boost, allowing it to threaten even common Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Gholdengo. Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p>"

Regenerator allows Amoonguss to check those same threats long-term; it also prevents it from being worn down by pivots like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko as well as entry hazards if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed via Knock Off. Spore incapacitates switch-ins such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Dragapult; the latter two would otherwise use it as setup fodder, while the former completely walls Amoonguss by being immune to Sludge Bomb. Sludge Bomb spreads status against the aforementioned Volcarona and Dragapult as well as bulkier switch-ins like Skeledirge and Tornadus-T and threatens Iron Valiant. Hidden Power Fire lets Amoonguss chip Poison-immune foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor as well as OHKO Kartana, preventing them from safely switching in. Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in as much as needed without fear of entry hazard damage; it also prevents Regenerator recovery from being stifled in longer games. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that wears down contact attackers like Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T as well as the aforementioned rain wallbreakers in Barraskewda and Floatzel. It should only be used if entry hazard control is decent enough, however, with support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. Tera Water provides invaluable resistances against Fire and Ice, letting Amoonguss potentially get an emergency Sludge Bomb or Spore in against foes like Weavile and Heatran. Tera Steel is an alternative that lets Amoonguss emergency check offensive foes like Tapu Lele while also giving it a better matchup against non-Heat Wave Tornadus-T; it also retains the Ice resistance given by Tera Water. Rotom-W is an excellent partner, as it stifles offensive and defensive Pokemon alike that Amoonguss struggles with, such as Heatran, Skeledirge, and Tornadus-T. In return, Amoonguss takes pressure off Rotom-W as a check to rain wallbreakers and can deal with Rotom-W switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. Gholdengo completely counters Amoonguss by virtue of its immunity to Spore and it taking negligible damage from Hidden Power Fire; as such, checks to it such as Kingambit and Poison Jab Clodsire are recommended, with the latter forcing Gholdengo to Terastallize so it can freely fish for poison.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots is the standard item for Alomomola; however if a team lacks a way to punish contact moves and has sufficient hazard removal, then Rocky Helmet should be considered. Tera Dragon allows Alomomola to check Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko missing Dazzling Gleam, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Choice Band Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, and Tera Poison provides a Toxic immunity and checks Iron Valiant. Common Pokemon unhindered by Toxic use Alomomola as setup fodder, such as Gliscor, Substitute variants of Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor. Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can punish the use of Flip Turn, along with Water Absorb Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W and some Clodsire variants can prevent the move from having any effect. Spikes, in conjunction with Knock Off from users like Mega Scizor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn can also be extremely lethal to Alomomola. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon that heavily rely on Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers, such as Zapdos, opposing Alomomola, Heatran, and Landorus-T, or Scald to threaten Kartana and Mega Scizor; but it should be noted that not using Toxic gives free setup turns to dangerous foes like Volcarona and Calm Mind Iron Valiant. Running a Sassy nature allows Alomomola to check Mega Diancie, while a Relaxed nature helps Alomomola pivot around Great Tusk. Teammates such as Ting-Lu and Heatran both take great advantage of Alomomola's support and can help shore up some of Alomomola's weaknesses, checking Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Volcarona, while more offensive partners like Zapdos and Gouging Fire can cover some of these weaknesses while also offsetting Alomomola's passivity, the former answering Kartana, and Zamazenta while the latter helps with Tapu Koko and Zapdos.</p>"

Leech Seed is Ferrothorn’s main form of recovery, letting it slowly wear down and pressure its switch-ins while also sustaining itself. Gyro Ball is a strong STAB option that allows Ferrothorn to put significant pressure on Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Serperior, which can otherwise setup on it safely, and deter Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele from switching in. Thunder Wave lets Ferrothorn immediately cripple switch-ins like Volcarona, Heatran, and Kartana, while Knock Off removes items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and opposing Ferrothorn, respectively, making them more susceptible to its entry hazards. Tera Ghost lets Ferrothorn flip its matchup against Pokemon using Fighting-type moves such as Superpower Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, or Zamazenta in a pinch, as well as block Great Tusk’s Rapid Spin and become neutral to Fire-type moves. The given EV spread allows Ferrothorn to survive a +2 Knock Off from Mega Mawile while otherwise maximizing its special bulk in order to handle threats like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele better. Due to Ferrothorn’s limited longevity, it fits best on offensively geared teams that appreciate the constant pressure it applies to Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex with its entry hazards, making Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny fantastic partners. Due to Ferrothorn’s lack of longevity, pairing it with a sturdy defensive backbone on more balanced structures with Pokemon like Toxapex, Clefable, and Alomomola is important, with the latter especially useful due to it being able to pass Wish to keep Ferrothorn healthy. These Pokemon also check pesky Fire- and Fighting-types such as Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, and Zamazenta for Ferrothorn, while in return Ferrothorn deals with Grass- and Psychic-types such as Kartana and Tapu Lele that these Pokemon struggle with. Other Pokemon that can set entry hazards, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Heatran, work well with Ferrothorn to form a potent hazard-stacking core, significantly pressuring Defog users such as Landorus-T and Tornadus-T with Toxic, Knock Off, and Gyro Ball, maximizing the chip damage dealt.</p>"

Additionally, its useful typing allows it to pivot into common defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Gholdengo, giving it opportunities of entry. Fire Blast complements Dark Pulse and Draco Meteor very well, hitting Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Kingambit. Flash Cannon allows Hydreigon to hit Fairy-types that would otherwise pivot into it, such as Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant, as well as hitting Mega Tyranitar moderately hard. U-turn is an alternative over the latter two moves that provides a more risk-free option to exploit Hydreigon's checks, giving Pokemon like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny free entry. Tera Dark further boosts Hydreigon’s power, allowing its Dark Pulse to reliably 2HKO the likes of Toxapex and Heatran. Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that have reliable options to switch it in safely. Hydreigon pairs very well with pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can switch it in against opposing defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Assault Vest Tornadus-T pairs particularly well with Hydreigon, as it notably checks Dragapult, as well as providing insurance against foes such as Iron Valiant. Pokemon that can exploit common switch-ins to Hydreigon such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit pair well with Hydreigon, meaning the likes of Great Tusk and Zamazenta are good partners. Similarly, Pokemon that can lure or weaken the aforementioned switchins, such as Gholdengo and Dragapult, pair well with Hydreigon.</p>"

Earth Power, in combination with Fire Spin, increases the damage that the aforementioned Pokemon take while also threatening Heatran. Alternatively, Dark Pulse can be used as a solid STAB move to hit airborne Pokemon such as Gliscor. Taunt prevents passive walls such as Toxapex and Gastrodon from healing while also preventing Hydreigon from being crippled by status from the aforementioned Pokemon as well. Tera Poison gives Hydreigon a Toxic immunity and a favorable defensive typing, allowing it to safely trap Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant. Offensive teammates like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, and Dragapult appreciate Hydreigon trapping and removing walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Gastrodon support Hydreigon, as they heavily chip and pressure switch-ins like Kingambit in combination with Hydreigon's Fire Spin. Hydreigon is easily forced out by Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Iron Valiant. As such, Pokemon that can handle the aforementioned threats such as Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Toxapex make great teammates for it.</p>"

Flamethrower is Volcarona's Fire-type STAB move of choice thanks to its decent Base Power and consistent damage output, although Fire Blast can be used for the extra power, allowing Volcarona to notably have a very high chance to OHKO defensive Landorus-T and Tapu Lele after Stealth Rock and OHKO Gliscor after one Quiver Dance, while Flamethrower cannot. Giga Drain provides good coverage alongside Volcarona's Fire STAB move, allowing it to hit Water-types such as Alomomola and potentially forcing them to Terastallize. Finally, Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to hit unexpecting Heatran, which would otherwise be a hard counter to this set. Flame Body allows it to punish careless contact moves from Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, non-Protective Pads Meowscarada, and Mega Scizor. Tera Grass powers up Giga Drain while turning Volcarona's Water weakness into a resistance, allowing it to safely take on threats such as Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Tera Ground allows Volcarona to dodge revenge killing attempts from the likes of Iron Boulder while powering up Hidden Power Ground to let it potentially OHKO Gouging Fire at +1. Due to Volcarona's high threat level, common attempts to check it involve using Terastallization on a defensive Pokemon, such as Heatran or Alomomola; as such, partners like Raging Bolt and Kyurem appreciate Volcarona forcing those Pokemon to Terastallize. Grass-types like Serperior are also great partners, as they can bait in Heatran for Volcarona while being able to switch in situationally on Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R that threaten it out. Serperior can also force progress with Glare on threats like Gouging Fire or setting up with Leaf Storm while chipping checks like Raging Bolt. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl are also good teammates to allow Volcarona to set up far more easily and win games quickly.</p>"

Hidden Power Ground is an alternative to hit foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Mega Diancie, and Raging Bolt. Giga Drain can be paired with Tera Grass to provide coverage against Rock-types like Garganacl and Mega Diancie, as well as Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Alomomola, and Mega Swampert, and it helps to keep Volcarona healthy without sacking momentum to use Roost. Roost makes sure that Volcarona can check foes like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny in the long run and win the 1v1 against Tapu Lele and Darkrai without being chipped severely. Tera Grass gives Giga Drain a STAB boost and removes Volcarona's weakness to Water-types, which can be useful against offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and rain. Tera Steel allows Volcarona to turn walls relying on Toxic to make progress into its setup fodder, examples of which are Alomomola and Blissey. It also provides Volcarona with better matchups against the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie. The above EVs make sure that Volcarona can survive the damage from Stealth Rock twice and outspeed Zamazenta at +1. Teammates like Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W can lure in walls like Ferrothorn and provide Volcarona with great opportunities to set up. They can also handle specially defensive foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for Volcarona when it's not equipped with Hidden Power Ground. Since it heavily relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent entry hazard damage, Volcarona appreciates teammates like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar to absorb Knock Off from foes like Landorus-T. It also benefits from teammates like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T checking Dragonite. Great Tusk and Landorus-T can relieve Volcarona of pressure from Stealth Rock by using Rapid Spin and Defog respectively when Volcarona loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T is the quintessential defensive pivot for many offense and balance teams, combining a unique blend of defensive prowess and utility to perform as a stellar support Pokemon. Intimidate gives Landorus-T the ability to pivot into many of the tier's physical attackers like Gouging Fire, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham, and while it may fear Ice Punch from the latter two, they will still be left with reduced Attack allowing teammates to have an easier time pivoting around them. Additionally, a crucial immunity to both Ground- and Electric-type attacks provides valuable role compression for offensive teams, helping deter the likes of Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Landorus-T from freely attacking. Leftovers provides passive recovery and longevity, but Rocky Helmet can be used instead on more aggressive teams that appreciate its ability to chip down threats like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta. Toxic gives Landorus-T the ability to put a timer on foes such as Zapdos and opposing Landorus-T as well as setup sweepers like Dragonite, while common Pokemon immune to Toxic such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking fear taking an Earthquake, rendering them unable to safely absorb it. Due to Landorus-T's ability to hit the field plenty of times over the course of a game, it is the single most effective and splashable Stealth Rock setter in the metagame. Defog is also within its wheelhouse due to naturally positive matchups versus common Stealth Rock users like Heatran and Garganacl as well as the more niche Ting-Lu. Taunt is an alternative option to prevent Defog from opposing Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos, and should be used with 76 Speed EVs to outspeed the latter two. Although Taunt is generally preferred on Stealth Rock sets, it can be used on Defog variants as well due to its ability to prevent both Toxic and additional hazards from opposing Landorus-T and Gliscor. Tera Water grants Landorus-T the ability to flip its weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Weavile while pivoting out and dealing large damage to the latter two with U-turn. Furthermore, it provides a temporary backbone for its team versus physical wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda found on rain teams, which could otherwise run over the offensive structures Landorus-T is typically found on. Teammates that appreciate Landorus-T pivoting into Ground-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Garchomp, Zamazenta, and Tapu Koko while maintaining momentum for its team, such as Galarian Slowking, Darkrai, and Tornadus-T, make for great teammates. Defensively, foes capable of absorbing the combination of Earthquake and Toxic like Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight prove to be difficult for Landorus-T to make progress against; however, with U-turn it can pivot out of these Pokemon and create opportunities for teammates such as Ogerpon-W, Volcarona, and Tapu Koko. Taunt variants, on the other hand, struggle to significantly threaten Ground-immune foes, often inviting in dangerous threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W; teammates that check these like Dragonite, Tapu Koko, and Ferrothorn are appreciated. Offensively, teams relying on Landorus-T as a physically defensive backbone may struggle with Ogerpon-W, Weavile, and Iron Defense Zamazenta; these weaknesses can be supported by pairing it with Dragonite, Mega Scizor, Volcarona, and Tapu Lele. The aforementioned Mega Scizor also helps by absorbing Knock Off from Kartana and Mega Tyranitar that would otherwise impair Landorus-T’s longevity, which is usually only supplemented by Leftovers.</p>"

Thanks to Intimidate and a powerful Earthquake, Landorus-T has plentiful opportunities to pivot on forced switches with U-turn against threats like Iron Boulder and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T as well as Volcarona. Defog is very effective since most entry hazard setters like Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Garganacl don't like being hit by Earthquake, which prevents them from staying in against Landorus-T and gives it easy opportunities to Defog. Explosion as an alternative allows Landorus-T to trade with threats like Ogerpon-W, Darkrai, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened checks like Gliscor, especially when Landorus-T is low HP. Tera Water removes Landorus-T's weakness against Water-types like Urshifu-R, Mega Swampert, and Hisuian Samurott, as well as common Ice-type moves like Ice Beam from Darkrai and Ice Shard from Weavile, and also gives Landorus-T a chance to revenge kill Volcarona. The given EVs make sure that Landorus-T outspeeds Zamazenta and survives a Choice Specs Moonblast from Iron Valiant and two Zen Headbutt from Mega Medicham after Stealth Rock. Teammates like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Darkrai appreciate Landorus-T for bringing them in safely via U-turn. In return, they can threaten walls like Alomomola and Gliscor for Landorus-T. Landorus-T can be worn down quickly due to Stealth Rock and its lack of recovery, so teammates like Alomomola and Ferrothorn are helpful to protect it from being overwhelmed too quickly by foes like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, both of which can also check Water-types like Mega Swampert for Landorus-T. Additionally, Alomomola can heal Landorus-T with Wish and form a pivoting core with it. Other pivots like Rotom-W and Iron Crown bring in Landorus-T safely and form VoltTurn cores with it.</p>"

Explosion lets Landorus-T deal massive damage once its job is done, being able to take a good chunk of damage out of almost any foe while also denying hazard removal from the aforementioned Defoggers and Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Tera Ghost prevents any hazards on the field from being removed by Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk if it's unable to safely use Explosion on it. Ogerpon-W is great offensive partner, as it’s able to come in on Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R which threatens Landorus-T.

Tera Water and Tera Fairy are Kyurem's main Tera types, as these let it change its defensive matchups behind Substitute making it harder for the likes of Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Garganacl to remove its Substitute. Tera Ground is another alternative to give Kyurem STAB on Earth Power, notably dealing more damage against Steel-types that aren't weak to Ground, like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. The EV Spread lets Kyurem hit 405 HP, meaning that its Substitute takes two Seismic Toss to remove. Teammates that struggle with the Flying-, Water-, and Ground-types that Kyurem preys on like Ogerpon-W, Gliscor, and Tapu Koko make for excellent teammates, as they appreciate its ability to deal with the Pokemon they can't.

Dual screens support from teammates like Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl are also incredible alongside Kyurem, giving it more opportunites to set up as well as hindering revenge killing attemps from the likes of Mega Medicham and Mega Scizor. Bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Alomomola are able to withstand Kyurem's attacks even after a boost, making wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant good teammates, as they can use them for opportunities to switch in, or weaken them down so Kyurem can take them out.

Substitute is the premier choice, as it enables Hawlucha to take advantage of passive foes like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Landorus-T and punish the foes it forces to switch out by setting up. Encore is an alternative option that turns setup sweepers like Swords Dance Gliscor into setup fodder and locks defensive pieces like Alomomola and Corviknight into status moves. Tera Flying removes Hawlucha's weakness to Psychic- and Fairy-type foes like Iron Crown, Clefable, and Iron Valiant and makes Acrobatics a terrifying STAB move that OHKOes Zamazenta with Dauntless Shield active and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock at +2. Tera Electric, on the other hand, makes Hawlucha resist Electric-type moves, notably Thunderclap from Raging Bolt, and it also allows Hawlucha to ignore Static from Zapdos and benefit from Terrain effects. The given EVs can allow Hawlucha to take a Moonblast from Clefable and outspeed Excadrill in sand. A good Terrain setter like Tapu Koko, Rillaboom, or Tapu Lele is necessary for Hawlucha to sweep. Tapu Koko can either set up dual screens to help Hawlucha set up or threaten Water- and Flying-types like Alomomola, Corviknight, and Tornadus-T for it. Rillaboom also helps with aforementioned Water-types and Landorus-T for Hawlucha. Both of them can pressure Dondozo for Hawlucha and pivot it in. Tapu Lele, on the other hand, enables an even more offensive playstyle with teammates like Armarouge, Iron Crown, and Polteageist for Hawlucha, which tears the opponent's defensive core in a pinch with powerful special attacks and appreciates Hawlucha threatening Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Hawlucha dislikes foes that punish contact moves, such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona, which makes Knock Off support from the likes of Rillaboom and Iron Valiant greatly appreciated. Due to its mediocre offensive stats, it also benefits from wallbreakers with immediate power like Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Hawlucha is prone to priority move users like Raging Bolt and Weavile before Terastallizing, so it is useful to have teammates like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele to threaten them.</p>"

Diamond Storm is used over Power Gem to dent common defensive checks harder like Galarian Slowking and Tera Grass Heatran. Moonblast is an amazing STAB move that crushes Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar while doing very considerable damage to Landorus-T. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that Mega Diancie would be checked by, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight. If a hazard setter is already present, Earth Power can be used alongside Mystical Fire to pressure Pokemon like Heatran, Toxapex, and Iron Crown. Other niche options like Encore and Protect are also usable, with the former allowing Mega Diancie to lock Pokemon like Raging Bolt and Gliscor into setup moves and the latter letting it scout foes like Landorus-T and Mega Medicham. 28 Attack EVs let Mega Diancie 2HKO Galarian Slowking with Diamond Storm. A Naive nature lets Mega Diancie stave off physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Tyranitar more, while a Hasty nature improves its matchup against special attackers like Tornadus-T and Darkrai. While Mega Diancie is an amazing offensive Pokemon, it often lacks opportunities to wallbreak due to its frailty. Defensive pivots like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking can deal with revenge killers to Mega Diancie like Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Iron Valiant, respectively. In return, Mega Diancie can stack entry hazards in tandem with the aforementioned pivots, forming a good balance core that wears down teams with ease. Offensive Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Darkrai appreciate Mega Diancie dealing with foes like Raging Bolt and Mega Tyranitar; said offensive Pokemon can also mess with common checks to Mega Diancie like Toxapex and Iron Crown.</p>"

That said, Hoopa-U competes with Kingambit, which has significantly higher bulk and a way to bypass its Speed tier issue in Sucker Punch. Hoopa-U has a 4x weakness to U-turn and neutrality to Pursuit, meaning it cannot enter or leave the field easily. Nonetheless, Hoopa-U does not require setup, and it therefore has a niche into bulkier teams thanks to its immediate power. Drain Punch lets Hoopa-U take on Dark-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar, and Zen Headbutt hammers Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Toxapex while also hitting Clefable and Tera Fairy Garganacl neutrally. Gunk Shot provides Hoopa-U with another way to break through Fairy-types such as Tera Fairy Garganacl and Clefable. Tera Dark powers up Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury while giving it a resistance to Pursuit. Hoopa-U fits well on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its power allowing teammates to clean. As such, partners such as Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele pair well with Hoopa-U. The former three also check Kingambit, making Hoopa-U less prediction reliant with its attacks, while the latter appreciates Hoopa-U being able to wear down Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Kingambit. Hoopa-U also has trouble getting into the field due to its low Speed and frail physical bulk, so pivots such as Mega Scizor and Rotom-W are appreciated to bring it in Hoopa-U more consistently. Rotom-W also pivots into Toxapex and Heatran to bring in Hoopa-U, while Mega Scizor pivots into Tapu Lele and Kingambit and brings in Heatran and Skeledirge for Hoopa-U to break through. Entry hazard setters are also appreciated, as Hoopa-U can more easily break through defensive teams with Spikes or Stealth Rock on the field. Thus, partners such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp are appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Toxapex is a versatile wall that can take on both physical and special hits, thanks to its great defensive stats, typing, and Regenerator, making it difficult to KO. Its typing in particular allows it to check common Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R while its utility moves like Knock Off and Toxic let it cripple them to benefit teammates. Scald can cripple physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Medicham, discouraging them from directly switching in to take advantage of Toxapex. Scald’s damage output reduces Toxapex's passivity and is also just enough to threaten Water-weak foes like Landorus-T, Iron Boulder, and Mega Diancie; this allows Toxapex to use Recover or Toxic with general safety. Knock Off allows Toxapex to remove valuable items like Choice items, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Leftovers from switch-ins like Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn. Toxic Spikes allows Toxapex to pressure offensive teams, forcing them to give up momentum to clear it lest they get poisoned. Haze prevents setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Iron Valiant from exploiting Toxapex, forcing them to attack, and disrupts wincons like IronPress Zamazenta and Volcarona. An EV spread of 248 HP / 212 Def / 48 SpD with a Bold nature allows Toxapex to maximize its physical bulk while surviving two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature simply maximizes special bulk. 248 HP EVs are important as it reduces entry hazard damage while benefiting more from Regenerator. Tera Dragon is useful to check Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, the latter of which is especially important on specially defensive sets, Tera Fairy helps versus Raging Bolt and Garchomp, and Tera Steel lets it check Serperior and Tapu Lele. The former two are also notable for removing Toxapex’s Ground weakness versus the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex, by nature of being a fat wall with little offensive presence, fits like a glove on stall and balance playstyles, sapping momentum but providing valuable utility. Allies on balance that can take advantage of Toxapex through double switches, like Ogerpon-W, Urshifu-R, and Mega Tyranitar, benefit from Toxapex baiting in Ground- and Psychic-types; by using Toxapex as a mid-ground, they can enter the field safely as the opponent switches to a Toxapex check like Gliscor and Choice item Tapu Lele. Teammates that help with the Ground and Psychic weaknesses on the defensive side, such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, are useful as well; in return, Toxapex tanks hits from Ice- and Fighting-types like Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny for them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Kommo-o is a fearsome wallbreaker with its capability to omniboost as soon as it gets an opportunity with Clangorous Soul. Its ability to set up on common Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona and to potentially use Tera Steel to ignore Toxic from defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex allows it to start wallbreaking very early with its powerful coverage. Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more. Bulletproof along with Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to wall Choice Scarf Tapu Lele looking to revenge kill it as well as set up in front of Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Normal gives Kommo-o a stronger Boomburst, while Tera Steel gives it a Toxic immunity and useful resistances to all of its weaknesses, allowing Kommo-o to take would-be checks, such as Dragapult, Tapu Lele, Baxcalibur, and Iron Valiant, by surprise and set up in front of them. However, Kommo-o likes to use its Tera and thus denies its teammates this option, and it can be checked by a well-timed Tera from Pokemon such as Tera Steel Garchomp and subsequently be revenge killed. It is also walled by the likes of Heatran, Garganacl, and Clodsire, which can tank its coverage options even without Terastallizing and cripple it with Toxic or Salt Cure or simply force it out and deny future setup opportunities. Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-o’s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-o’s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep. Hazard support is also valuable in preventing opponents from switching back and forth between Pokemon in a Regenerator core; in particular, Assault Vest Tornadus + Toxapex; Pokemon like Great Tusk and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches.</p>"

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>With Belly Drum, Kommo-o becomes a fearsome sweeper capable of wiping unprepared teams with relative ease. The HP cuts from Substitute and Belly Drum will immediately activate Salac Berry, giving Kommo-o maximum Attack along with increased Speed to sweep offensive and defensive teams alike. Substitute also allows Kommo-o to dodge status moves like Ferrothorn’s Leech Seed, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Landorus-T's Toxic, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp that could potentially ruin Kommo-o’s sweep, instead giving it a free set up opportunity. Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it. Although Soundproof blocks moves such as Roar from defensive Garchomp and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, it is generally not preferred due to the lack of relevant sound-based moves in comparison to the bevy of aforementioned qualities gained from Bulletproof. Tera Electric can power up Thunder Punch with STAB to score KOs on the likes of Gholdengo, Tapu Lele, and Tera Fairy Kingambit, while Tera Steel gives it useful resistances that may allow it to reach Salac Berry range without Substitute by tanking a resisted hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or Mega Diancie. Belly Drum Kommo-o fits on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to sweep or clean up teams once its checks are removed. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-o’s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute —namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great Speed, power-boosting ability in Electric Terrain, and access to both U-turn and Volt Switch, Tapu Koko functions as a great offensive pivot. It often utilizes its ability to force out slower foes like Mega Charizard Y, Alomomola, and Hisuian Samurott to safely pivot in wallbreakers that take advantage of Electric Terrain like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Iron Moth in safely via U-turn or Volt Switch. U-turn is usually favored for its consistency against Ground-types like Gliscor and Clodsire and ability to deal more chip damage to Grass-type Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Serperior; alternatively, Volt Switch has higher damage output and avoids contact punishment from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Volcarona, but being blocked by Ground-type Pokemon makes it less reliable. Hidden Power Ice targets popular Ground-type such as Landorus-T and Gliscor and is the preferred option over Dazzling Gleam. Heavy-Duty Boots complements Tapu Koko's frequent pivoting by negating entry hazard damage, while Electrium Z lets it pick off weakened foes such as Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Volcarona. Due to its typing and mediocre Special Attack stat, Tapu Koko struggles with bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, as well as sturdy walls like Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and Ferrothorn; therefore, it needs powerful teammates like Mega Medicham, Iron Valiant, and Hawlucha to break through them. Those teammates also appreciate Tapu Koko checking faster offensive threats such as Tornadus-T, pressuring walls such as Toxapex, and generating momentum for them to make use of. Tapu Koko also has great synergy with the likes of Iron Crown, Landorus-T, and Iron Moth, forming the infamous VoltTurn combo. In the case of Iron Moth and Iron Crown, Tapu Koko’s Electric Surge activates Quark Drive for them. In return, they take care of Tapu Koko’s checks such as Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"

Tera Ghost is used solely for blocking Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, whereas Tera Flying allows Tapu Koko to safely set up dual screens in front of Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, though it should be noted that Tapu Koko rarely Terastallizes. Tapu Koko's Electric Surge is a powerful tool, allowing Hawlucha to reliably activate Unburden while also activating Quark Drive from the likes of Iron Valiant, Iron Crown, and Iron Boulder. Setup sweepers such as Volcarona, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor appreciate Tapu Koko's dual screens, which allow for easier setup. Defog is able to remove Tapu Koko's dual screens and Electric Terrain, making Serperior, Encore variants of Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W, and Taunt from Hisuan Samurott and Landorus-T solid options to use alongside Tapu Koko, as they can punish Defog users. Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Iron Moth are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Tapu Koko, making teammates that can take advantage of them, such as Iron Valiant, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite, excellent partners.</p>"

Additionally, Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves like Mega Lopunny's Fake Out and Weavile's Ice Shard, which is useful for Tapu Lele itself and teammates that aim for a sweep such as Hawlucha and Volcarona. Focus Blast lets Tapu Lele hit common Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Psyshock allows Tapu Lele to hit foes with weaker Defense stats like Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Volcarona, along with shutting down Calm Mind Tera Poison Cresselia. Future Sight can be used to hit in tandem with teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta, threatening Toxapex and Zapdos looking to switch into their attacks. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire nails Mega Scizor along with hitting Ferrothorn more consistently than Focus Blast. Tera Psychic is the premier Tera option, as it boosts Tapu Lele's Psychic STAB attacks to ludicrous heights, smashing through most neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Tera Fairy is a niche alternative, boosting Moonblast to powerful levels while minimizing the threat of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Despite having Focus Blast, Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn are still effective checks to Tapu Lele, so teammates such as Gliscor and Mega Lopunny can be used to mitigate this.

Psyshock can hit Galarian Slowking, 2HKO Chansey, and OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Future Sight can help teammates like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny wallbreak, as it deals good damage to switch-ins like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Landorus-T.

Other than shutting down problematic setup sweepers like Volcarona, Trick + Taunt improves Tapu Fini's matchup against defensive Pokemon by crippling and shutting down switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Clodsire, and Toxapex, especially with Misty Terrain to protect it and its teammates against theirs and the likes of Rotom-W, Heatran, and Gastrodon's status moves. If the team lacks an entry hazard remover, Tapu Fini can run Defog if necessary, as it matches up well against entry hazard setters like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. However, its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and lack of longevity make it a poor candidate to do it consistently. Ice Beam can be run to potentially 2HKO offensive Tornadus-T and OHKO Landorus-T, while Nature's Madness is an option to dent its checks hard—especially ones that lack reliable recovery—such as Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. However, forgoing Taunt or Defog loses out on Tapu Fini's utility, which makes shutting down walls and supporting its team needlessly more difficult. Tera Steel allows Tapu Fini to emergency check threats like Tapu Lele and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T; it also provides a better defensive typing against walls like Toxapex and Ferrothorn, which is more useful if using Taunt. The Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed +1 Mega Gyarados, while the Special Attack EVs allow it to KO Urshifu-R after Stealth Rock. Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn are great teammates to deal with faster threats like boosted Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T; Ferrothorn also provides Spikes to chip down foes like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Garganacl into Tapu Fini's KO range, compensating for its middling damage output. Offensive teammates like Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile love its Misty Terrain to protect them against debilitating status from walls like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge, letting them set up and attack more safely; Volcarona also enjoys Tapu Fini luring in and crippling their shared checks like Toxapex and Clodsire with Trick, while Choice Band Weavile appreciates Tapu Fini removing Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

The given EV spread maximizes Buzzwole's physical bulk while ensuring it always outspeeds Kingambit. Buzzwole fits best on defensive teams, which appreciate it as a fallback measure against the myriad of physical wallbreakers while not caring for its relative passivity. Pokemon such as Clodsire and Hippowdon can shore up Buzzwole's weakness to common special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Dragapult, and Tapu Koko. Buzzwole appreciates pivots such as Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Gliscor, which can absorb chip damage from moves like Scald, Salt Cure and—for the latter two—Knock Off. Buzzwole has a tendency to thud into Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Lele if not using Toxic, so it pairs well with the likes of Gholdengo and Weavile that can exploit them.</p>"

Its great matchup versus the former two, along with Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn exacerbate this, being particularly one of the most effective Defoggers in the metagame. With Grassium Z, Kartana is even more effective at removing entry hazards, being able to deal a massive blow to Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, KOing even the latter two with minor chip. Knock Off is Kartana's coverage move of choice, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona while giving it an avenue to make meaningful progress against Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking. The given EV spread lets Bloom Doom OHKO offensive Garchomp, which could otherwise comfortably tank Leaf Blade and KO Kartana with its +2 Earthquake. Due to Kartana's ability to often lure Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp with its Bloom Doom, Tapu Koko makes for an excellent teammate, also appreciating Kartana's ability to keep Ferrothorn's entry hazards off the field; in return, Tapu Koko can check Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T for Kartana. Teammates that benefit from Kartana’s entry hazard removal like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y form a nice core with it as well, allowing them to stay healthy and hit the field to help break down Kartana’s checks like Zapdos and Heatran. Kartana is not without flaw as a Defogger; it is most notably helpless against Stealth Rock Heatran, so teammates that assist with Heatran such as Gliscor and Hisuian Samurott work well, being able to often trade entry hazards to help mitigate Kartana's inability to safely clear them in the face of Heatran. Furthermore, Kartana’s terrible Special Defense renders it unable to check Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko effectively unlike other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, so teammates like Galarian Slowking, Weavile, and Landorus-T can ease these matchups.</p>"

Wood Hammer is an even stronger STAB move, allowing Rillaboom to dispatch defensive stopgaps like Toxapex and Landorus-T; its recoil is also partially offset by Grassy Terrain recovery. Knock Off lets Rillaboom force progress on its rather limited defensive answers like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos by removing their Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots and making them more prone to being worn down by repeated hits or entry hazards, while Superpower shellacks supposed switch-ins like Heatran and Ferrothorn. U-turn lets Rillaboom pivot itself out from unfavorable matchups against the aforementioned Corviknight, as well as against Dragonite and Mega Scizor, letting it form a pivoting core with teammates like Urshifu-R or switch into threatening teammates like Volcarona and Heatran. Hawlucha in particular greatly benefits from being able to activate Unburden through Grassy Seed, giving it a Defense boost and letting it sweep weakened teams. In return, it threatens the Steel-types that wall Rillaboom, like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Dragon-types like Raging Bolt and Gouging Fire can be massive headaches for Rillaboom, so teammates that can threaten them, like Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele, are great partners for Rillaboom. On the flip side, teammates like Gouging Fire and Mega Scizor can struggle to break through bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex, a job well-suited for Rillaboom.

Will-O-Wisp cripples physically offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile. Court Change helps temporarily keep off entry hazards, especially from the likes of Ferrothorn, while High Jump Kick OHKOes Mega Tyranitar and deals heavy damage to Heatran and Mega Diance. The given EV spread allows Cinderace to outspeed Iron Valiant and 2HKO maximum HP Galarian Slowking with Pyro Ball. Tera Fire bolsters Pyro Ball's damage, letting it OHKO offensive Volcarona and 2HKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Cinderace can form a VoltTurn core with other pivots like Tapu Koko and Meowscarada, as they can take advantage of its checks like Toxapex, Alomomola, and Rotom-W.

Bulk Up is important for Corviknight to attempt a sweep in the later stages of the game as well as still be a functional check to the likes of Mega Scizor and Swords Dance Gliscor. Substitute lets Corviknight rack up boosts safely on more passive Pokemon like Clefable, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking; it also prevents it from having its Leftovers removed from Knock Off and avoid status while also letting it waste more PP from Heatran's and Zapdos’s attacks. Tera Dragon is extremely important for Corviknight, as it lets it flip the matchup on Fire- and Electric-types like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-W, turning the latter two into setup fodder. The given EV spread allows Corviknight to live a boosted Continental Crush from Garchomp and outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor, with the rest maximizing its special bulk. Entry hazard support is crucial for Corviknight to sweep, as it needs to waste as much recovery PP as it can from its checks to sweep in the later stages of the game, making Clefable and Gliscor important teammates. Both of these also switch into Toxapex safely, while the latter can also pivot and take advantage of Heatran. Knock Off support further supplements Corviknight by crippling Zapdos, Toxapex, and Rotom-W, making Mega Tyranitar and Weavile good partners. Corviknight can often be worn down easily and forced to waste Roost PP early on if it is the sole defensive pivot, making it inefficient at sweeping, so pairing it up with a sturdy defensive backbone, for example Toxapex + Mega Latias, can help spread the load. Prior to Terastallizing, Corviknight can be forced out by strong Electric- and Fire-types like Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Raging Bolt, so having strong checks to these Pokemon such as the aforementioned Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Draco Meteor Mega Latias is important.</p>"

With Swift Swim, Barraskewda outspeeds nearly the entire metagame, including boosted foes like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Hawlucha. Liquidation's chance to drop Defense potentially lets Barraskewda beat Pokemon it normally can't on the switch in like Latias and Rotom-W. Aqua Jet allows it to finish off dangerous foes outside of rain like Volcarona and Iron Boulder. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to pivot out on Pokemon like Toxapex and Dondozo while also chipping them and giving a free switch to its teammates like Mega Swampert. Close Combat KOes Ferrothorn and Archaludon after Stealth Rock and can chip Ogerpon-W on the switch. Psychic Fangs is a niche move that allows it to beat Pokemon that it would otherwise struggle against like Toxapex, but it doesn't do much else. Tera Water allows Barraskewda to significantly dent checks like Mega Latias and Rotom-W, as well as potentially breaking Toxapex after Defense drops. Pelipper is necessary teammate to set up rain, remove entry hazards, or pivot out with U-turn and let Barraskewda in safely due to its extreme frailty. Mega Swampert is an important teammate thanks to its immunity to Electric-type attacks from Raging Bolt and Rotom-W; it also threatens Toxapex and can wear down foes like Rotom-W and Ferrothorn so Barraskewda has an easier time muscling past them. Barraskewda is easily revenge killed by Rillaboom and Raging Bolt so defensive teammates like Iron Treads and Ferrothorn are necessary; they can also set up hazards that will wear down Barraskewda's checks like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Iron Treads in particular is a good partner because it pivots in Barraskewda with Volt Switch and removes hazards so Barraskewda can break through teams more often. In return, Barraskewda forces out Fighting- and Fire-types that check Iron Treads and Ferrothorn such as Mega Lopunny, Iron Valiant, and Volcarona. While it has a great Attack stat, Barraskewda struggles to beat defensive foes that resist Water-type attacks like Dondozo, Alomomola, Dragonite, and Tera Dragon Zapdos, so Archaludon is a good partner to threaten these foes.

Healing Wish gives Hatterene the ability to fully heal one of its teammates, giving wallbreakers and setup Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Kingambit another chance to break through the opposing team. Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult. Nuzzle provides Hatterene with a way to punish Pokemon that would safely pivot into it otherwise, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T. Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex while maximizing its ability to pivot into physical attacks. Hatterene greatly benefits teams that rely on keeping entry hazards off the field, such as sun teams and some offense teams. As such, Mega Charizard Y is a fantastic partner, as it appreciates Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field and walling Toxapex; in return, it is able to pressure Pokemon Hatterene brings in, such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Focus Sash users such as Polteageist and Cloyster also make for good teammates thanks to Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards. Similarly, pivots such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult appreciate Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards and give them a second chance with Healing Wish, letting them come in safely and consistently. Hatterene's lack of longevity means that it usually cannot act as the sole form of hazard control. As such, Rapid Spin Great Tusk is a good partner alongside Hatterene for keeping hazards off of the field while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y on sun teams.</p>"

Magic Bounce gives Hatterene a way to switch into entry hazard setters, utilize Calm Mind to force them out, and avoid status from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Toxapex. Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire hits Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ferrothorn super effectively. Draining Kiss acts as a form of recovery for Hatterene. Tera Water gives Hatterene a solid defensive typing while removing its weakness to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex, letting Hatterene take out Toxapex with an attack before having its boosts removed by Haze. Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T appreciates Hatterene being able to Terastallize to force opposing Gholdengo to Terastallize, as well as keeping hazards off the field for it. Kingambit and Garganacl are great partners for their ability to reliably check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo, with Kingambit even being able to Pursuit trap them. Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor can check Kingambit for Hatterene as well. Hatterene's lack of longevity outside of Draining Kiss means that it appreciates a secondary form of entry hazard removal from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Hatterene enjoys pairing up with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as they pressure the opponent into using Defog, alleviating Hatterene's need to block entry hazards, as well as wearing down Hatterene's answers such as Heatran and Gholdengo.</p>"

Taunt denies Defog from foes such as Rotom-W and Tornadus-T and denies entry hazards from foes such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon. It also prevents foes such as Volcarona and Annihilape from using Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Spirit Break chips foes such as Ting-Lu and makes it easier to set up dual screens in front of special attackers such as Tapu Lele. Parting Shot can be used to pivot into teammates such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Mega Scizor after setting screens, but it lets Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile—as well as Annihilape—exploit it, hindering its effectiveness. Superpower lets Grimmsnarl OHKO Kingambit after Stealth Rock, but it is ineffective outside of this matchup and is hard to justify over other alternatives. Grimmsnarl will very rarely Terastallize since teammates such as Dragonite take advantage of it far better. In a pinch, however, Tera Steel reverses its weaknesses and provides an overall solid defensive typing, which helps against foes such as Tapu Lele and Gholdengo. Tera Ghost is an alternative that prevents opposing Great Tusk from removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Teammates that take advantage of dual screen support such as Mega Scizor, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Kingambit make good partners, setting up safely and avoiding potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and opposing Kingambit. Mega Scizor is a particularly good partner, handling foes such as Kingambit that use Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Grimmsnarl has difficulty denying entry hazards from foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu, so it appreciates teammates such as Cyclizar clearing hazards from the field.

Its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield give it opportunities to wallbreak via its prowess in offensively checking Mega Lopunny, Hisuian Samurott, and Ogerpon-W. Stone Edge pairs fantastically with Zamazenta's STAB, nailing Volcarona, Zapdos, Moltres, and Tornadus-T while avoiding adverse contact effects from the former three. Ice Fang is Zamazenta's only option to break through Gliscor and Landorus-T and its strongest attack against Dragonite. Heavy Slam is the preferred last coverage move to hit Clefable and render Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant incapable of soft checking Zamazenta, while Crunch threatens Psychic-types in Galarian Slowking, Slowbro, and Mega Latias. Wild Charge is Zamazenta's strongest attack against Toxapex but deals pitiful damage regardless without a Choice Band and can still be easily pivoted against even with the boost. Heavy-Duty Boots increase Zamazenta's longevity, allowing it to switch in and threaten opposing teams more often, whereas Choice Band provides more immediate power, albeit at the cost of being incredibly prediction-reliant to break through most teams carrying multiple Fighting-resistant foes. Rockium Z is a niche alternative that reduces difficulties in KOing Zapdos by minimizing the need for prior chip damage mitigating and Stone Edge's meager accuracy. It also helps in breaking through Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Clefable and Galarian Slowking without the correct coverage move once properly chipped. Tera Fighting is preferred to boost Close Combat's power against neutral targets such as Ogerpon-W and Alomomola, with chances to OHKO and 2HKO them, respectively, without Choice Band and muscle through checks such as Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Tera Steel flips the tables against Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's revenge killing attempts and secures the KO on Clefable after minimal chip. Zamazenta can fit on more defensive teams as speed control that forces out offensive terrors such as Ogerpon-W to supplement a defensive core, or it can be used on offensive teams supported by other wallbreakers while helping check threats to such teams such as Mega Lopunny with its natural bulk and Dauntless Shield. Regardless, its best support remains Future Sight from Tapu Lele, Galarian Slowking, or Slowbro, as Zamazenta is most often handled by switching between Pokemon that resist its moves and physically bulky pivots such as Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Alomomola or stopped in its tracks by Toxapex. Future Sight punishes these situations by dealing massive damage, particularly against Toxapex.

Alternatively, Crunch can be used to deal with Galarian Slowking and is also stronger than Heavy Slam against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that commonly Terastallize into the Ghost typing, and Stone Edge is another option that threatens Volcarona and Zapdos while avoiding Flame Body and Static, respectively, and allows Zamazenta to deal with Tornadus-T without the need to Terastallize. Zamazenta struggles to break through Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Zapdos, and Toxapex that have the bulk to take multiple boosted Body Press and either threaten it back directly or can use Haze to remove Zamazenta's boosts. Therefore, teammates such as Mega Tyranitar that can Pursuit trap and wear down these Pokemon are invaluable. Other options such as Calm Mind Iron Valiant can also trade for heavy damage against most of these Pokemon, clearing the way for Zamazenta to sweep. Tera Electric allows Zamazenta to turn Zapdos into a setup opportunity, resisting both of its STAB attacks and being unafraid of Static, while Tera Steel allows Zamazenta to set up on Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well as turning Heavy Slam into an OHKO on both.</p>"

Thunder Punch is an alternative that threatens Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Alomomola. Tera Steel is advised for preventing revenge killing from the likes of Tornadus-T, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, while granting a Toxic immunity allowing it to use Alomomola as setup fodder.

It can outspeed many common threats like Mega Lopunny, Greninja, Ogerpon-W, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele while also being able to revenge kill many setup sweepers even after a boost, such as Mega Gyarados and Gouging Fire. Addtionally, Surging Strikes allows Urshifu-R to OHKO Focus Sash users like Glimmora and Landorus-T while also improving its matchup against Zamazenta, bypassing its Dauntless Shield Defense boost. U-turn provides Urshifu-R the utility to gain momentum from its checks like Alomomola, Slowbro, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Aqua Jet can serve as a backup plan to revenge kill faster setup sweepers like Volcarona, while Thunder Punch can hit bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Slowbro as well as Corviknight. Tera Water enables Urshifu-R to achieve valuable OHKOes versus the likes of Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny, while also strengthening Aqua Jet to better combat setup sweepers like Iron Boulder. Teammates like Raging Bolt and Tapu Lele appreciate Urshifu-R's ability to bring them in against bulky defensive walls like Corviknight, Alomomola, and Toxapex. Tapu Lele can also set strong Future Sight for Urshifu-R to abuse and break through Toxapex. However, it is recommended to not to use Aqua Jet when Urshifu-R is paired with Tapu Lele due to its Psychic Surge. Abilities like Rough Skin, Static, and Flame Body as well as Rocky Helmet punish Choice Scarf Urshifu-R due to the multi-hit nature of Surging Strikes, so teammates with access to Knock Off like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T are useful to help Urshifu-R by removing Rocky Helmet from the aforementioned foes as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Zapdos and Moltres.</p>"

Earth Power and Mystical Fire complement its STAB Moonblast well, with the former hitting Toxapex, Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Heatran, while the latter OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Focus Blast grants Enamorus its strongest attack to hit Garganacl and Mega Tyranitar, which could otherwise survive Earth Power and Moonblast, respectively, while Psychic provides a safer middle ground option for Toxapex  Clodsire, and Mega Venusaur, which staves off its attacks otherwise. Tera Fairy grants Enamorus a power boost to Moonblast, notably allowing it to secure OHKOs against the likes of Landorus-T and Rotom-W, which would barely survive it otherwise. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking power while being able to support it adequately. Pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T grant Enamorus free switch in opportunities against Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. The latter two pivots and Great Tusk, also provide entry hazard removal, which aids Enamorus given its Stealth Rock weakness.

It is incredibly difficult to switch into after a boost given its strong Moonblast alongside coverage options in Earth Power and Mystical Fire to hit Fairy-resistant foes such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, respectively. Alternatively, Enamorus can forgo Mystical Fire for Substitute to take advantage of pivoting attempts as well as sponge attacks from revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant, although it makes it less effective at hitting Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. If using Substitute, Enamorus can opt for Leftovers instead of the standard Heavy-Duty Boots to potentially set up more Substitutes. Tera Ground boosts the power of Earth Power, allowing it to KO most Toxapex and Gholdengo sets after a boost, as well as giving it an immunity to Tapu Koko and Rotom-W's Electric-type attacks. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its use as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker while granting it sufficient opportunities to enter the field. Therefore, pivots such as Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T pair well with it, bringing Enamorus in on physical walls it can exploit such as Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Skarmory. Additionally, Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile eliminate special walls such as Clodsire and Gholdengo that can serve as a roadblock to Enamorus. Fast late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Kartana appreciate Enamorus, as they capitalize on it weakening or removing Steel-types for them to clean up.</p>"

Additionally, it can serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T have been weakened by its teammates. However, its Stealth Rock weakness and relative frailty mean Enamorus struggles to withstand repeated switches as well as priority moves from the likes of Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Moonblast, notably allowing it to 2HKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Aside from coverage to hit Steel-types in Mystical Fire and Earth Power, Healing Wish can bring back a weakened teammate in a pinch, potentially being able to change the tide of a game. Therefore, Enamorus fits best on offense teams that appreciate its utility in Healing Wish while providing a positive matchup against opposing offensive teams. Powerful wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Volcarona appreciate Enamorus's Healing Wish, giving them a second lease on life, while Enamorus in turn capitalizes on them weakening the likes of Toxapex and Mega Scizor to clean late-game. Enamorus also greatly enjoys entry hazard removal support from Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, or Great Tusk, as it minimalizes its Stealth Rock weakness so it can switch in more effectively mid-game. Enamorus struggles with special wall such as Clodsire and Gholdengo, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk make for good partners that can take advantage of them.</p>"

Toxic Spikes, when paired with Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T that pressure Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, can be hard to deal with and put setup sweepers like Iron Boulder on a timer. Spikes can be used to chip down foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex after they have had their Heavy-Duty Boots removed. U-turn pivots out Meowscarda from its checks like Toxapex and Ferrothorn and brings in wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Zamazenta against them. Protective Pads protects Meowscarada from the abilities of Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and Rocky Helmet Pokemon like on Landorus-T, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it avoid getting worn down by entry hazards. Tera Grass can help Meowscarada survive moves like Moonblast from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R, if Protean has changed its type. Entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Landorus-T, and Gliscor appreciate having Meowscarada as a teammate, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex and Zapdos, making their hazards more potent. Meowscarada's mediocre defenses and weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks mean it appreciates defensive teammates like Clefable, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn that resist or are neutral to those attacks. Meowscarada can pair well with other pivots like Landrous-T and Iron Crown, forming a VoltTurn core to help it deal with its checks like Toxapex.

Garganacl can safely set up Stealth Rock against common pivots like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking. Common Defog users like Zapdos, Corviknight, and Moltres can barely threaten Garganacl and take dangerous passive damage from Salt Cure. Other entry hazard removal Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk also dislike Salt Cure as they rely on Leftovers for passive recovery. Protect is crucial for Garganacl for passive recovery from Leftovers and to exacerbate chip damage from Salt Cure. It can also help to scout moves from Choice item users like Tapu Lele and Rillaboom, as well as stalling weather turns against rain and sun teams. However, it is important not to rely on Protect too much to the point where Garganacl can be exploited by opponents. Garganacl has a variety of good Tera types; Tera Water turns the tables versus Pokemon like Urshifu-Rapid-Strike and Mega Scizor and performs better against rain and sun, but leaves it vulernable to opposing Garganacl and Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Tera Dragon has most of the advantages of Tera Water in addition to checking Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, but it makes Garganacl weak to Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost both help Garganacl to check Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Mega Lopunny appreciate Garganacl's ability to threaten Water- and Flying-types. Garganacl also benefits from them dealing with offensive targets like Tapu Lele and opposing Ogerpon-W. Garganacl's main way to gain momentum is via Salt Cure, so foes with Abilities like Regenerator and Poison Heal can nullify its chip damage. It is therefore very helpful to have teammates like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko to spam Knock Off or threaten common Regenerator pivots.</p>"

      "Curse": {

Curse in conjunction with Terastallization lets it take hits from common physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T, and its ability prevents it from getting Toxic poisoned, a major roadblock to slow setup sweepers. Salt Cure allows Garganacl to chip foes and is complemented by Attack boosts from Curse; it also discourages common threats to Garganacl like Iron Crown and Urshifu-R from switching in directly. Earthquake hits almost all foes for decent damage with enough boosts, threatening Steel- and Electric-types like Iron Crown, Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Koko for particularly high damage; Salt Cure covers Flying-types that Earthquake cannot reach. Heavy Slam deals immediate damage to Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Clefable, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB moves or are immune to Salt Cure's passive damage in the latter's case. Tera Water allows Garganacl to beat common Water-types like Manaphy, Urshifu-R, and Mega Swampert, giving its team a positive matchup against rain teams. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to resist Fighting-type moves from Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, especially when unboosted, as Garganacl gets several free turns to set up after surprising these foes. Garganacl is a fat momentum sapper that lends itself well to balance teams, as they are able to compensate for its lack of immediate power with their ability to withstand heavy damage; Alomomola, a commonly seen Pokemon on these archetypes, is a great ally that can heal up Garganacl, allowing it to be used more recklessly with Salt Cure to offset the passivity of other allies. Garganacl is extremely hampered by Taunt and Knock Off users, as they prevent it from setting up and healing and prevent Leftovers passive recovery. It is best to wait for such foes to be eliminated before trying to set up. Therefore, Knock Off absorbers like Mega Scizor and Gliscor are good teammates to threaten Knock Off users including Hisuian Samurott and Ferrothorn. Garganacl performs best when used with Terastallization, as its base typing gives it nasty weaknesses to common foes like Zamazenta and Landorus-T; thus, allies should try not to expend Terastallization early-game. This means that a solid defensive core, such as Alomomola and Heatran, should be used to help with the longevity of the team and can chip down foes until it is safe to set up.</p>"

Close Combat is a good coverage option, letting Ceruledge dent bulky Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar; alternatively, Shadow Sneak offers a form of priority that can pick off unsuspecting revenge killers like Iron Boulder. Focus Sash allows Ceruledge to usually guarantee an oppotunity to set up one Swords Dance, while Ghostium Z turns Poltergeist into a nuke that can eviscerate even the bulkiest of Pokemon, OHKOing even Alomomola and Toxapex at +2. Tera Ghost allows Poltergeist to be boosted to ludicrous power levels without having to invest in Ghostium Z, letting Ceruledge OHKO offensive Great Tusk and Gliscor after a boost. Bulky Dark-types, like the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar, can force Ceruledge out - therefore, Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta as well as Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant are great partners for it. In return, all of them appreciate Ceruledge being able to threaten bulky Pokemon that might try to take their attacks, such as Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, Toxapex, and Heatran.

Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko and—if Focus Sash is still intact—Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p>"

Slither Wing lures in Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite, so Pokemon such as Weavile and Tapu Koko pair well with it, both notably forcing Dragonite to Terastallize into the Normal-type and making it prone to First Impression.</p>"

With both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, it can lay entry hazards while keeping them off for its teammates, and it is very threatening to Magic Bounce Pokemon in Mega Diancie and Hatterene. Steel Beam allows Iron Treads to sacrifice itself quickly in order to deny Defog attempts from the likes of Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. It is also Iron Treads's main tool of pressuring Hatterene, and it is generally powerful enough to chunk certain Ground-resistant and immune Pokemon, like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole. Booster Energy and Quark Drive together allows Iron Treads to outrun the entire unboosted metagame as well as Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, and Gholdengo, allowing it to consistently lay entry hazards. Tera Ghost allows Iron Treads to block opposing Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk if necessary. Iron Treads should be used as a lead on hyper offense teams, so other support teammates and sweepers are natural partners. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko allow their sweeping teammates another layer of support and safety, and they can use Taunt to consistently deny Defog attempts even after Iron Treads has fainted. Common hyper offense sweepers, like Mega Gyarados, Galarian Moltres, Kingambit, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur appreciate Iron Treads laying Stealth Rock while keeping hazards off at the same time. The former two in particular appreciate this, as Mega Gyarados is weak to Stealth Rock before mega evolving, while Galarian Moltres often prefers other items over Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Due to its amazing bulk, Iron Hands is able to setup Swords Dance reliably to punch holes through foes more easily. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to hit Gliscor, Landorus-T and Garchomp super effectively, complementing its STAB moves nicely. Iron Hands can use Tera Water to take otherwise super effective hits from the likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Great Tusk, alongside gaining a resistance to Water-type moves, allowing Iron Hands to answer common rain abusers including Mega Swampert and Barraskewda, while Tera Flying makes Iron Hands immune to Ground-type moves from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp. The given EV spread allows Iron Hands to survive an unboosted Tapu Lele Psychic from full HP, while the Speed investment lets Iron Hands outspeed Clefable. Because of Iron Hands's poor Speed but fantastic bulk, it's more suited to bulky offense and balance teams as opposed to hyper offensive team structures. Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor and Tornadus-T are fantastic teammates because they can switch into the strong Ground-type moves that threaten Iron Hands such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush; in addition, they can all remove entry hazards, which is appreciated by Tera Flying variants, and the former two are also able to set hazards, helping Iron Hands break through teams more easily. Rillaboom can setup Grassy Terrain, weakening opposing Earthquake and giving Iron Hands more passive recovery alongside Leftovers while weakening the defensive Ground-types that could stop Iron Hands, although it should be noted Tera Flying variants will not benefit from the terrain. Defensive Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Iron Crown are good teammates because they can come in on the Psychic- and Fairy- types that Iron Hands dislikes, such as Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and Mega Latios. Alomomola boosts Iron Hands's longevity with Wish while being a good answer to Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Garchomp. Strong special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona appreciate Iron Hands breaking through common special walls like Galarian Slowking, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor, and in return they break through physically defensive walls like Landorus-T and Dondozo. Thunder Wave users such as Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn slow down foes such as Corviknight and Skarmory for Iron Hands to outspeed afterwards, so that it can hit them with boosted attacks before they can setup against it with Iron Defense.</p>"

Tera Flying boosts Hurricane to obscene levels while also giving it a resistance to Close Combat from the likes of Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Ground gives Iron Jugulis a Stealth Rock resistance and gives it an easier time breaking through the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Clodsire. Iron Jugulis values pivots like Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, and Slowbro, as they provide it opportunities for it to come in and pressure Pokemon like Tangrowth and opposing Slowbro. Tapu Koko in particular is an astounding partner, as it enables Quark Drive for Iron Jugulis, which lets it outspeed Pokemon like Dragapult and Mega Lopunny. Slowbro also provides Future Sight to pressure Toxapex and Clodsire. Pokemon that can wear down checks to Iron Jugulis such as Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Ting-Lu with entry hazards like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran are appreciated.

The potential Special Attack boost from Fiery Dance makes scouting the set of Iron Moth extremely dangerous. Energy Ball is for Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Water-types like Alomomola, Dondozo, and Urshifu-R. Dazzling Gleam threatens foes like Zamazenta and Garchomp with an OHKO at +1. Tera Blast with Tera Ground allows Iron Moth to OHKO Heatran, 2HKO Galarian Slowking or OHKO it at +1 with minor chip damage, and 2HKO Garganacl, meanwhile providing Iron Moth with a valuable immunity to Thunder Wave from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn. Tera Grass, on the other hand, gives Energy Ball a STAB boost, which can guarantee it OHKOes foes like Mega Diancie and Urshifu-R without a Fiery Dance boost. It also flips Iron Moth's weakness to Water- and Ground-types, easing the matchup versus Ogerpon-W and Garchomp. The Special Attack and Speed EVs give Iron Moth a Speed boost with Quark Drive, and the remainder goes to Defense instead of HP in order to better take priority moves like Fake Out from Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, Extreme Speed from Dragonite, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile, and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R after Terastallizing. Iron Moth appreciates teammates like Ogerpon-W and Landorus-T to pressure its common checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking when not running Tera Ground. Additionally, Ogerpon-W can break Multiscale on Dragonite to give Iron Moth an easier clean. Landorus-T and Great Tusk can provide entry hazard control with Defog and Rapid Spin respectively to cover Iron Moth's weakness to Stealth Rock. Tapu Lele is also a great partner of Iron Moth since its Psychic Surge can protect Iron Moth from revenge killers like Mega Mawile, and the two of them can wear down their common checks like Galarian Slowking and Heatran for each other.</p>"

Fiery Dance is favored over other Fire-type moves because with its boost, Iron Moth is able to break through lesser sturdy checks like Gliscor. Energy Ball paired with Tera Grass is usually the first choice to reverse its matchup against Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Alomomola, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Dazzling Gleam boosted by Tera Fairy allows it to blow up Zamazenta, Dragon-type Pokemon like Garchomp and Raging Bolt that it otherwise struggles against. Tera Blast combined with Tera Ground lets it OHKO its biggest predator, Heatran, as well as hit popular special walls like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex for super effective damage. All three coverage moves also help Iron Moth beat Mega Tyranitar after it switches into entry hazards multiple times. The last slot is usually reserved for utility. U-turn takes advantage of Iron Moth's ability to lure in checks such as Galarian Slowking and Clodsire and pivots wallbreaker teammates like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Medicham in, aiding a more offensive playstyle; Morning Sun boosts Iron Moth's longevity, enabling it to stay healthy and check opposing Mega Scizor and Iron Valiant throughout the game. Because of its mediocre Base Power moves, Iron Moth often struggles with bulky walls; therefore, it appreciates hazard support from teammates like Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn to chip at checks such as Heatran and Garganacl, while powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile improve its matchup against sturdy walls that ignore hazard chip damage like Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Blissey. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile especially help in chipping and even eliminating those walls with Pursuit support, which often relieves the urgency for Iron Moth to use Tera as well. In return, Iron Moth can pressure and threaten physical walls like Slowbro and Great Tusk that its teammates have trouble with. Iron Moth also appreciates slow pivots that can bring it safely onto the field, such as Galarian Slowking and Alomomola.</p>"

Its high Speed combined with Booster Energy allows it to outspeed +1 setup sweepers like Mega Gyarados, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona, as well as naturally fast targets like Mega Lopunny and Darkrai. The popularity of specially offensive Iron Valiant can allow this set to catch opponents off guard and give it a free opportunity to use Swords Dance against foes like Galarian Slowking. Swords Dance boosts Iron Valiant's power to dangerous levels, enabling it to OHKO foes neutral to Fighting like Corviknight and Alomomola with a favorable roll or minor chip damage. Knock Off provides valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown, and it can also take down walls like Ferrothorn and Garganacl after they use Tera Ghost. Encore can lock physically defensive walls like Alomomola and Landorus-T into recovery moves or status moves like Defog, which can give Iron Valiant a good chance to set up. Ice Punch is an alternative to Encore for Landorus-T and Dragonite. Tera Dark gives Knock Off a STAB boost, allowing it to do more damage to foes like Galarian Slowking and Zapdos. Tera Steel, on the other hand, provides Iron Valiant with resistances to common priority moves like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Ice Shard from Weavile, and Extreme Speed from Dragonite, which can prevent it from being revenge killed. Tera Steel can also be paired with Encore to take advantage of Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking and Toxic from foes like Alomomola. Iron Valiant pairs well with teammates like Iron Boulder, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt, since they can pressure common checks for it, such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Dondozo. Iron Valiant is very fragile to priority moves due to its low bulk and the side effects of Close Combat, so Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge can protect it from priority moves and allow it to safely sweep. In addition, Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant can take care of each other's checks. Iron Valiant can break Galarian Slowking and Heatran, while Tapu Lele gives physical walls like Dondozo a hard time. Iron Valiant also appreciates other Knock Off users on its team to help wear down Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers.</p>"

Speed Booster Energy allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as setup sweepers like Mega Gyarados, Great Tusk, and Dragonite at +1 without being Choice locked. Moonblast is its most spammable STAB move, since most Steel-types are threatened by Focus Blast, leaving Galarian Slowking as one of its few reliable checks. Thunderbolt provides valuable coverage against Water-types like Alomomola and Toxapex, while Shadow Ball hits Galarian Slowking super effectively. Focus Blast is Iron Valiant's strongest STAB move, OHKOing common Steel-type walls at +1 such as Mega Scizor after a decent amount of chip damage, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Encore prevents sweeps from setup Pokemon like Volcarona and lets Iron Valiant set up against Pokemon like Alomomola and Toxapex. Tera Electric makes Iron Valiant immune to paralysis from walls like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking while allowing Thunderbolt to OHKO Alomomola and specially defensive Toxapex after minimal chip at +1. Tera Ghost grants Iron Valiant a resistance to Poison-type moves and gives Shadow Ball a STAB boost, allowing it to better take advantage of its coverage and 2HKO Galarian Slowking with minimal chip or at +1. Tera Steel is a good defensive type that helps Iron Valiant set up on the likes of Alomomola and Choice-locked Tapu Lele and provides a resistance to priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Ice Shard, and Extreme Speed. It can also be paired with Encore to turn Galarian Slowking into setup fodder by locking it into Sludge Bomb. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Mega Scizor that overwhelm common special walls in Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Blissey, letting it sweep. Knock Off support from the likes of Mega Scizor and Tyranitar is also appreciated, as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Toxapex and Leftovers from Heatran and Ferrothorn can help position Iron Valiant to sweep.</p>"

Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move over Aura Sphere or Focus Blast because it can do more damage to foes like Heatran and Iron Boulder while maintaining strength and accuracy. Knock Off is an excellent way of making progress, as it can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers on common walls like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Landorus-T, and it can provide valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown. Trick is fantastic against more passive teams and can cripple switch-ins like Toxapex and Alomomola. It can also lock setup sweepers like Volcarona into one move, making them much easier to deal with. Destiny Bond, on the other hand, can be used as an emergency plan to trade with foes like Ogerpon-W and Gouging Fire, especially after they acquire several boosts. Tera Fairy can increase the power of Moonblast, guaranteeing a 2HKO against utility Tornadus-T and Zapdos and an OHKO against Zamazenta. Teammates like Hisuian Samurott and Ogerpon-W pair well with Iron Valiant, since they can pressure foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola. In addition, Hisuian Samurott can also stack Spikes via Ceaseless Edge, which greatly helps Iron Valiant with its lack of power, as it can often remove Heavy-Duty Boots from key targets such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off or Trick. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Mega Scizor and Zapdos to help it deal with Iron Boulder and Hawlucha, which are capable of outspeeding it.</p>"

Ogerpon’s unique Speed boost upon Terastallizing and ability to hold an item give it more potential to clean through a weakened team while outrunning common revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Kartana. However, Ogerpon faces stiff competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana, as well as the other Ogerpon formes that possess a beneficial dual typing and an automatic 1.2x boost to their attacks. Superpower allows Ogerpon to wreak havoc on defensive cores using Ferrothorn and Heatran as Grass-type switch-ins, scoring a clean OHKO on Heatran and heavily denting physically defensive Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance. Meadow Plate is the item of choice, OHKOing Gliscor after Swords Dance with Stealth Rock chip, as well as potentially OHKOing Toxapex after Tera Grass and Swords Dance. Knock Off is Ogerpon's strongest option to hit Tornadus-T, Moltres, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking. Additionally, Defiant leverages Landorus-T's Intimidate against it; however, its poor matchup versus Defog users such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight render it unable to effectively switch in on Defog attempts and activate Defiant. Teammates that match up effectively into these aforementioned Defog users, such as Ting Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Gliscor, serve as quality teammates, with Mega Tyranitar in particular being able to chip these foes into range of Ogerpon's attacks.

Swords Dance amps up Ogerpon-W's power to dangerous levels, most notably OHKOing standard Ferrothorn with Superpower and 2HKOing defensive Zapdos and Toxapex with Ivy Cudgel and Power Whip, respectively. Power Whip is a more threatening STAB option thanks to its high Base Power, but Horn Leech lets Ogerpon-W offset any Toxic damage from Toxapex and Alomomola, letting it set up on the pair. Superpower hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Archaludon, OHKOing them at +2. Alternatively, Encore lets Ogerpon-W gain setup opportunities against passive foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex using status moves. With Tera Water, Ogerpon-W not only gets a huge boost to Ivy Cudgel's power, but also gains a Special Defense boost, which can help stave off revenge killing attempts from threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-W can struggle with Grass-types like Kartana and Ferrothorn, especially if lacking Superpower, so teammates like Heatran and Tornadus-T are greatly appreciated. Heatran also sets Stealth Rock to help Ogerpon-W defeat its answers that lack recovery, like Raging Bolt and Archaludon if Ogerpon-W lacks Superpower, over a longer period of time if it cannot brute-force its way through them. Tornadus-T, meanwhile, can remove entry hazards to improve Ogerpon-W's longevity as well as remove crucial items like Leftovers from defensive stops like Toxapex and Raging Bolt. Its Nasty Plot set also appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls like Ting-Lu and Chansey. Offensive teammates like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar can deal with Dragon-types like the aforementioned Raging Bolt and Dragonite; Weavile and Mega Tyranitar in particular can Pursuit trap said Dragon-types, opening Ogerpon-W up to sweeping. Despite having a good Speed tier, Ogerpon-W is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats like Iron Boulder and Mega Lopunny; as such, teammates that can switch into these threats, like Landorus-T and Gliscor, are highly appreciated.

However, Ogerpon-C should be mindful about using its Tera, as this removes its Sturdy for an arguably worse +1 Defense. Power Whip is used for its higher Base Power, which reduces Ogerpon-C's reliance on Swords Dance for immediate power, while Horn Leech trades damage for healing and reliability. Superpower allows Ogerpon-C to hit Ferrothorn, although this breaks Sturdy, along with Tera Steel foes like Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-C's main weakness lies in its reliance on Sturdy to set up against more powerful foes and its lack of immediate power before setting up. Thus, it is better off being saved as a cleaner for the later stages of a game. Entry hazard support, in particular Spikes, is highly valued to allow Ogerpon-C to KO many more threats; it can capitalize on hazard chip, for instance KOing even bulky foes like defensive Great Tusk unboosted once they are chipped. Thus, allies that can set hazards early-game like Hisuian Samurott and Garchomp are good partners. Ogerpon-C is also held back by its middling Speed tier, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by Mega Lopunny, as it is capable of bypassing Sturdy, along with many other foes like Iron Valiant if Ogerpon-C has already lost Sturdy.

Body Press and Aura Sphere both complement Archaludon's coverage to break through Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. The former receives a boost from Stamina and deals with Heatran and Ting-Lu better, while the latter is more consistent with Electro Shot boosts in rain and avoids chip damage from Iron Barbs. Stealth Rock can be used as an alternative choice on non-Assault Vest sets to allow teammates like Mega Swampert to run coverage moves like Ice Punch and Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Archaludon can threaten premier entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Landorus-T, ensuring Stealth Rock stays up. Depending on the pacing of the team, different items and EV spreads are available for Archaludon. Leftovers is used to increase its longevity, which helps long-term. Eject Pack can be favored to keep the momentum up by preventing Archaludon from being stuck on the field against pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Assault Vest Iron Crown after its Special Attack is lowered by Draco Meteor. Assault Vest makes up for Archaludon's weak Special Defense and often lets it trade with one or more offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Iron Moth. To pair with Assault Vest, a bulky spread of 204 HP EVs is used, while 52 Speed EVs still allow Archaludon to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta. Tera Fairy also grants a resistance to Fighting-type moves and is a better defensive type overall due to only having a few weaknesses as well as not being weak to Stealth Rock.

Outrage can be used as a nuke with Dragonium Z, letting Gouging Fire muscle past walls such as Dondozo through its sheer strength alone. Tera Ground can be used to power up Gouging Fire's Earthquake while allowing it to remove its weaknesses to revenge killers such as Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Great Tusk, allowing it to potentially win on the spot. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gouging Fire to come in many times and attempt to set up, while Booster Energy gives Gouging Fire a one-time Attack boost that can be crucial in breaking past foes such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T while still allowing Gouging Fire to Terastallize. Teammates that struggle with Steel-types, like Tapu Lele and Pecharunt, appreciate Gouging Fire breaking through those Steel-types. In return, they dispatch the physical walls that trouble Gouging Fire, such as Dondozo. Gouging Fire is often prone to getting revenge killed by Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, so teammates that can deal with the aforementioned threats, like Mega Scizor and Landorus-T, are appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gouging Fire is a great setup sweeper that utilizes its good bulk, solid defensive typing, and Terastallization to exploit common Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Alomomola and break through teams efficiently. Flare Blitz is reliable STAB into Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk; however, Heat Crash can be used for its lack of recoil, though its variable Base Power makes it harder to break through the aforementioned Pokemon. Earthquake lets Gouging Fire hit Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Toxapex. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, letting Gouging Fire maintain a sweep, check Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Iron Valiant long term, and offset Flare Blitz recoil. The given EV spread lets Gouging Fire take Scorching Sands twice at full HP from Mega Charizard Y and outspeed Tornadus-T at +1. Tera Steel turns would-be checks to Gouging Fire like Alomomola and Raging Bolt into setup fodder while also providing a Toxic immunity. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Tapu Lele that struggle against Steel-types like Kartana and Mega Scizor appreciate Gouging Fire checking and setting up on them. Gouging Fire also provides a good matchup into sun teams, which offensive teammates like Mega Lopunny and Kartana appreciate as well. In return, the latter threatens Water-types like Alomomola and other Pokemon that check Gouging Fire like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Gouging Fire is a potent wallbreaker and cleaner commonly found on sun teams. Under sun, Tera Fire makes Heat Crash a very powerful and spammable move. Flare Blitz allows Gouging Fire to hit heavier Pokemon that Gouging Fire can't hit as hard with Heat Crash, like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Raging Fury is an alternative option to this, as it is not a contact move and does not deal recoil damage. 168 Attack EVs and a Jolly Nature allow it to gain a Speed boost under sun with Protosynthesis. Even with this combination, Gouging Fire is still stopped by heavier foes that are also very physically bulky, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk and Dondozo. Choice Band Gouging Fire is also very prone to entry hazard chip, as it does not hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Because of these reasons, Gouging Fire largely appreciates hazard removal options like Great Tusk and Iron Treads that also synergize well with sun setters, which are Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y. Great Tusk is great under sun as it can be a good wallbreaking partner with an Attack Protosynthesis boost. Great Tusk is also able to help wallbreak against some other Fire-resistant foes, such as Garganacl, chipped Alomomola, and opposing Great Tusk. Iron Treads , on the other hand, has Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in safely. Gouging Fire also greatly appreciates Pokemon that can threaten Alomomola and Dondozo on their weaker Special Defense side, like Raging Bolt and Mega Charizard Y. Raging Bolt can threaten Gouging Fire's common switch-ins like Dondozo and Alomomola with powerful Special attacks and super effective STAB moves and also use Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in very easily. Gouging Fire also supports Raging Bolt by threatening the Ground-types and Electric-resistant foes that can switch into it, such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y is one of Gouging Fire's best partners, as it sets up sun with Drought, allowing Gouging Fire to boost its Speed with Protosynthesis, and can also break holes into opposing teams with Solar Beam and powerful Fire-type moves.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With access to Calm Mind and a stellar base 137 Special Attack, Raging Bolt is able to act as an excellent bulky setup sweeper. Raging Bolt’s good typing allows it to break through defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Rotom-W while also checking threats like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Kartana. Thunderclap offsets Raging Bolt’s subpar Speed stat, allowing it to revenge kill offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened setup sweepers like Iron Boulder, Volcarona, and Swords Dance Kartana, while Thunderbolt gives Raging Bolt a consistent damaging attack that doesn’t rely on prediction like Thunderclap and has significantly higher PP, allowing Raging Bolt to use its Electric-type moves in longer games. Substitute is an alternative to nullify passive Pokémon that can’t touch Raging Bolt such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and give it more opportunities to set up, while Taunt can be used to deny setup from Garganacl and Mega Scizor but at the cost of a worse matchup against Galarian Slowking. Draco Meteor in tandem with Dragonium Z lets it break through Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu as well as other specially bulky Pokémon that can take on Raging Bolt such as Mega Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Alternatively, Leftovers is also an option on Substitute sets to passively heal the chip taken from Substitute and give Raging Bolt some form of recovery. Tera Flying grants Raging Bolt a Ground immunity while giving a Fighting resistance that helps against Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also avoiding any Ground-type coverage from Serperior. Tera Fairy gives this same Fighting resistance while giving Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Gouging Fire. The given EV spread allows Raging Bolt to live a +2 Superpower from Ogerpon-W after Stealth Rock, as well as outspeeding uninvested Landorus-T. Raging Bolt struggles against fast Ground- and Fairy-types like Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and especially Tapu Lele; Tapu Lele in particular can give Raging Bolt some trouble as well, as its Psychic Surge renders Thunderclap useless. Teammates like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Galarian Slowking help beat these checks. Since Raging Bolt has no reliable recovery, Alomomola is a good partner to pass huge HP wishes to it and pivot it in. Other pivots like Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T also help bring Raging Bolt in safely. Teammates like Great Tusk and Zamazenta appreciate Raging Bolt taking care of Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos as well as bulky Waters like Rotom-W and Alomomola. In return, they help check Ferrothorn and Weavile. Great Tusk is another good partner, because it helps remove entry hazards, which harm Raging Bolt greatly, particularly Spikes.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Boulder is an excellent late-game cleaner, with Swords Dance allowing it to sweep and its good Speed stat and Booster Energy letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame including most Choice Scarf users. It has access to a strong STAB move in Mighty Cleave that bypasses Protect, which can be useful against a weakened Gliscor. Close Combat has great coverage alongside Mighty Cleave and hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garganacl, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Tyranitar for massive damage, being able to OHKO all of them at +2 Attack with Tera Fighting. Zen Headbutt hits Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R. Substitute allows Iron Boulder to scout for switches, as well as become immune to certain status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Iron Boulder can use Tera Flying to become immune to Earthquake that would otherwise OHKO it from Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. If your team has Tapu Koko to provide Electric Terrain, one option is to use Rockium Z over Booster Energy to power up Mighty Cleave to insane levels, OHKOing Gliscor and all but the bulkiest Landorus-T with Stealth Rock support after a Swords Dance. However, this option does make Iron Boulder dependent on Electric Terrain to retain its boosted Speed. Tapu Koko can also set up Reflect and Light Screen to help facilitate a sweep. Iron Boulder fits best on highly offensive teams, and functions as a late-game cleaner as well as a emergency check to speedy threats including Dragon Dance users like Gouging Fire and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R benefit from having Iron Boulder on the team, as Iron Boulder can take advantage of and switch into Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T that such allies are weak to. Teammates such as Hawlucha, Kartana and Iron Valiant can appreciate Rockium Z Iron Boulder's massive damage onto Landorus-T and Gliscor. Non-Rockium Z Iron Boulder can struggle with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. Because of this, having a switch-in like your own Landorus-T or Gliscor is very helpful. Additionally, Iron Boulder can be revenge killed by Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, so having answers to it like Volcarona and Gouging Fire is important. Iron Boulder appreciates hazard support from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as it can chip checks that would otherwise just fall short of a KO. Furthermore, physical wallbreakers such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny that can put Landorus-T and Gliscor in range of a +2 Mighty Cleave are also appreciated, especially since Gliscor can’t use Protect to heal with Poison Heal against Mighty Cleave, and Landorus-T doesn't have any reliable recovery. Finally, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Volcarona that can break through foes like Alomomola, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor are also greatly appreciated.</p>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>With an Assault Vest, Iron Crown becomes a nearly impenetrable special tank, capable of stomaching attacks from the tier's strongest wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie. However, its lack of longevity means it can be worn down very quickly by Spikes damage, making it only suitable for highly aggressive offense teams. Volt Switch complements such teams, bringing Iron Crown's wallbreaking teammates in safely against passive switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking. Psychic Noise punishes passive Pokemon which attempt to absorb Iron Crown's Volt Switch such as Gliscor and Ferrothorn by preventing them from healing, whereas Tachyon Cutter threatens less specially bulky Volt Switch blockers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Future Sight combined with Volt Switch helps teammates such as Zamazenta and Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Focus Blast lets Iron Crown be more individually threatening, scaring Ferrothorn and Heatran, and dealing slightly more damage to Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar compared to Tachyon Cutter. The given EV spread maximizes Iron Crown's special bulk while allowing it to receive a Special Attack boost in Electric Terrain via Quark Drive, permitting it to be more threatening on offensive teams. A Calm nature and maximum Special Defense investment can be used instead to bolster Iron Crown's special bulk, especially if it forgoes Assault Vest for the increased longevity Heavy-Duty Boots provides. Tera Fairy is Iron Crown's preferred Tera type to invert its Dark weakness against Darkrai, Mega Tyranitar, and Hisuian Samurott; as another option Tera Water provides a Water resistance in a pinch against aggressive rain teams. Iron Crown fits best on offensive teams that appreciate a non-passive defensive backbone against special attackers that can provide support via pivoting and Future Sight. Landorus-T is its best partner, as it functions similarly as a pivot with access to Stealth Rock and U-Turn, complementing Iron Crown by checking physical attackers such as Garchomp and Gouging Fire. It also provides an Electric immunity, which Iron Crown appreciates as it fails to prevent Raging Bolt and Zapdos from freely setting up Calm Mind or pivoting with Volt Switch, respectively. In the same vein, Alomomola forms a potent defensive core alongside Iron Crown, pivoting into physical attackers and increasing Iron Crown's longevity via Wish support. Iron Crown's usage of Psychic Noise is bolstered by entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Heatran, as Psychic Noise ensures entry hazard damage sticks by disabling foes' passive Leftovers recovery. Iron Crown pairs well with Pokemon that pressure Ground-types such as Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R, as they prevent Gliscor and Ting-Lu from hindering its functions as a pivot. Alternatively, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Ursaluna can utilize Iron Crown pivoting out against walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking to find opportunites to wallbreak. Additionally, Iron Crown finds a role on Electric Terrain teams fueled by Tapu Koko, with a Quark Drive boost making it more threatening or even bulkier. In return, Iron Crown indirectly supports Tapu Koko by helping fellow teammates on Electric Terrain teams such as Hawlucha and Iron Valiant wallbreak, with Future Sight pressuring checks such as Toxapex and Zapdos.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Iron Crown is a potent setup sweeper in the tier. With decent bulk and useful resistance, it is able to set up on some offensive Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T as well as ignore Toxic from passive Pokemon like Alomomola. Maximum Speed investment with just 172 Special Attack EVs ensures Iron Crown gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive, allowing it to outspeed many popular threats in the tier such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Zamazenta alongside common Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, so it can set up first against the former foes and not be revenge killed by the latter. Focus Blast is a powerful coverage move that hits Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hisuian Samurott, which are immune to Stored Power, for super effective damage. Iron Defense complements Calm Mind to turn Iron Crown into a nigh-indestructible powerhouse and provides a boost to Stored Power, while Tachyon Cutter can be used for its immediate damage output against Fairy-types and Garganacl or to better deal with opposing Psychic-type Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Mega Latias better. Tera Fighting makes Focus Blast a STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Heatran unboosted and Ferrothorn at +1, as well as giving Iron Crown a resistance to Dark-type moves from Darkrai and Tyranitar that it would be weak to otherwise. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta, and is a better defensive type overall due to it only having a few weaknesses. Calm Mind Iron Crown only becomes dangerous after a few boosts, therefore, dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko are exceptional partners, as their screens provide more opportunities for Iron Crown to start setting up. Iron Crown also has great synergy with Tapu Lele, which provides Psychic Terrain to prevent it from being revenge killed by priority moves like Thunder Clap from Raging Bolt and Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, as well as increase the damage of Stored Power.</p>"
