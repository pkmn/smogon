        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high mixed natural bulk and resistances to many prominent offensive types, along with its natural ability to ignore Knock Off and status conditions, Mega Venusaur becomes a decent Mega Evolution for a myriad of team compositions. Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Earth Power is required to hit Heatran and also to prevent the likes of Gholdengo, Sneasler, and Kartana from taking advantage of Mega Venusaur’s STAB options. Giga Drain hits most foes that resist its coverage moves like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Great Tusk for neutral damage. It also gives more healing opportunities, since Synthesis has low PP. The given EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outspeed Landorus-T and Moltres, potentially KOing them with a crucial Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Mega Venusaur pairs well with teammates with a strong offensive presence, since they can fall back on its defensive capabilities to break throughout the course of a game. Specifically, since Mega Venusaur is unfazed by Knock Off and status conditions, it can reliably check Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana can utilize its defensive capabilities and ability to switch into their checks to wallbreak more consistently. However, Mega Venusaur is very vulnerable to entry hazards, so allies that can remove them like Rotom-W and Great Tusk make great partners. Mega Venusaur is also easily checked by the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Lele, which can threaten it with powerful STAB moves, and Skarmory, which ignores damage from its moves. Some good teammates that can cover and check these include Gliscor, Heatran, and Gholdengo; in exchange, Mega Venusaur can check opponents like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, since Synthesis heals less in rain, Mega Venusaur has reduced longevity against this archetype despite its resistance to Water, so it will need additional support from teammates like Gastrodon and Rotom-W to cover this.</p> "

Drought + Solar Beam allows Mega Charizard Y to subdue Water-types such Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini, further restricting its defensive counterplay. Fire Blast is preferred to hit as hard as possible, though Flamethrower's perfect accuracy and greater PP make it worth consideration. Weather Ball is an interesting option, as it presents a challenge to rain teams by dealing considerable damage to Pelipper on the switch, but it comes at the cost of Mega Charizard Y losing its primary STAB move outside of sun. Scorching Sands pressures Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge, while Focus Blast threatens Mega Tyranitar. Mega Charizard Y's tremendous wallbreaking prowess allows late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Dragonite, and Volcarona to take advantage of Unaware walls that have been compromised, such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. Mega Charizard Y's sun support benefits Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk. Mega Charizard Y appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Kartana, as it is extremely susceptible to Stealth Rock. It also struggles to break bulky Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Mega Latias as well as special walls like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Weavile, Tyranitar, and Kingambit subsequently form strong offensive cores with Mega Charizard Y, as they are able to Pursuit trap its aforementioned checks, with the former being able to deal with Hippowdon as well. Mega Charizard Y's middling Speed tier and unremarkable physical bulk leave it prone to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko.

Dragon Claw is an alternative on hyper offense teams where the longevity isn't as necessary, which allows Mega Charizard X to hit Dragonite, Mega Latias, and Garchomp as well as providing neutral coverage against foes like Rotom-W, Tera Water Skeledirge, and Tera Grass Heatran.

Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Zamazenta all take advantage of Pokemon that Dragonite tends to struggle with, such as Dondozo, allowing it to sweep more easily late-game.</p> "

Mew has near-perfect coverage with Stored Power and Body Press, with the latter able to crucially smash Steel- and Dark-types like Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile, which would otherwise exploit it. Covert Cloak is a must for Mew to avoid being worn down by Garganacl’s Salt Cure and help against being burned by Scald from the likes of Toxapex. Tera Poison grants Mew an immunity to Toxic, removing the biggest roadblock to its sweep, allowing it to beat the likes of Heatran, Clodsire, and Gliscor. The given EV spread lets Mew outspeed non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Since Mew is very passive while setting up, it is prone to being overwhelmed by Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Garchomp or used as setup fodder by Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Tornadus-T, thus making it crucial that Mew sets up or Tera at the right time. As such, teammates like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Zapdos are much appreciated to help check those Pokemon for Mew. Taunt from Tornadus-T and Heatran and Trick from Choice Specs Iron Valiant shut Mew down, so having teammates like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Mega Scizor help deal with them. Gholdengo, in particular, is hard for Mew to deal with, as it can boost at a faster rate than Mew while taking a fully stacked-up Stored Power with ease and being immune to Body Press. Therefore, teammates that can threaten or Pursuit trap it such as Garchomp and Kingambit are very appreciated. Toxapex uses Haze to sit on Mew and forces it to Tera to avoid Toxic, thus overwhelming or removing Toxapex with the likes of Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Heatran allow Mew to set up and win.</p> "

Future Sight + Teleport or Chilly Reception lets Slowking support its frail offensive teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult, giving them safe switch ins and amplifying their wallbreaking prowess afterwards. Teleport is a much more reliable way of pivoting, as its higher PP makes it more valuable in longer games and it provides Slowking's teammates with a safe switch in against Ferrothorn and other Teleport users like Blissey and Slowbro. Alternatively, Chilly Reception's snow helps disrupt weather teams like sun and rain as well as support Ice-type teammates like Kyurem and Weavile with its Defense boost. Tera Fairy improves Slowking's matchup against Dragapult and Tapu Koko and maintains its Fighting resistance against Mega Lopunny, while Tera Dark lets it better stomach Ghost-type attacks from Gholdengo and Dragapult at the cost of being weaker against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Both Tera choices importantly prevent Slowking from being Pursuit trapped by Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Wallbreakers like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Kingambit appreciate Slowking's slow pivoting, with the looming Future Sight pressuring their switch-ins like Toxapex, Buzzwole, and defensive Great Tusk. Moreover, Slowking switches into their revenge killers, notably Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Ting-Lu, and Tangrowth cover foes like Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Kartana, respectively; Ferrothorn and Tangrowth also deal with rain wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda that would otherwise overwhelm Slowking despite its Water resistance, with the latter in particular forming a Regnerator core with Slowking.</p> "

U-turn allows it to serve as a pivot: easily switching it out of checks such as Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y, it brings in teammates like Tapu Koko and Dragapult to deal with them. Close Combat can be used to dispose of Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran much more quickly, greatly denting them on the switch. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to survive two Close Combats from Mega Lopunny after Stealth Rock and outspeed uninvested Heatran, with the HP and Special Defense EVs helping it check Tapu Lele. Mega Scizor's pivot support is extremely valuable to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zamazenta, which all also appreciate how well it exploits defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Rotom-W forms a strong VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor as well, with both pivoting out on their checks and racking up solid chip damage over time.

Mega Scizor wearing down Rotom-W and Heatran is also particularly useful for Tornadus-T, as these Pokemon can heavily damage or cripple Tornadus-T in one way or another.

Close Combat KOes Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn, as well as providing a strong neutral hit against Rotom-W. Dual Wingbeat hits Clodsire and Toxapex for reliable neutral damage and also hits Zamazenta super effectively, Knock Off is an alternative to hit Gholdengo reliably and remove items like Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots from Tornadus-T, Skeledirge, and Volcarona. This allows a teammate or Mega Scizor to wear them down much more easily. Knock Off is especially relevant in Rotom-W's case, as removing Leftovers makes it easier to put into KO range of +2 Close Combat. Running Knock Off makes Toxapex a much worse matchup, however, so Pokemon like Great Tusk and Tapu Koko that can pressure it are appreciated. Sand Tomb can be used to reliably beat Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gholdengo, preventing them from reliably checking it. Offensive Mega Scizor fits much better on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredibly valuable—though short-term—defensive utility. Grimmsnarl is a perfect teammate, providing dual screens to let it set up against foes like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Landorus-T; it also pivots Mega Scizor in and appreciates it baiting in Gholdengo, which prevents Grimmsnarl from pivoting as effectively. Gholdengo itself is also a notable partner, as it appreciates Mega Scizor dispatching the most popular Dark-types in Weavile and Kingambit. Entry hazards from suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp allow Mega Scizor to clean late-game, as its foes must be chipped before any sweeping is done. Entry hazards particularly help in wearing down checks like Urshifu-R and bulkier Garchomp sets. Mega Scizor struggles against bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W and Volcarona; Dragonite and Dragapult can take care of the latter, switching into Volcarona to set up as it switches into Mega Scizor, whereas Great Tusk can remove Leftovers from the former, making it easier for Mega Scizor to dispatch with +2 Close Combat. Physically defensive Unaware walls in Skeledirge and Dondozo completely wall Mega Scizor, so offensive Pokemon that can bait in or wear down these foes, including Iron Valiant, make for solid partners.</p> "

Tera Fighting lets Skarmory deal with Kingambit more comfortably. The EV spread allows Skarmory to outspeed Mega Mawile and maximum speed Kingambit. Skarmory fits on defensive builds, ranging from balance to stall. Special walls like Garganacl and Hippowdon are necessary to cover threats like Dragapult and Volcarona that would exploit Skarmory's poor special bulk. Hippowdon is an exceptional partner, as it also deals with foes like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, Mega Charizard Y, as well as mixed attackers like Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant.

Thunder Wave can also be used to annoy fast threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. It also allows Blissey to status Steel-types like Kingambit, Heatran, and Kartana. Teleport allows Blissey to safely pivot in teammates like Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Mega Medicham. However, Blissey is an acceptable Stealth Rock user if no other fits on your team. Shadow Ball can be considered as a niche option to break Dragapult's Substitutes and chip offensive Gholdengo, but it usually isn't worth dropping other moves. Tera Fairy gives Blissey a Fighting resistance in exchange for negligible Poison and Steel weaknesses, and it reduces the damage it takes from Pursuit users like Kingambit, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. This should be used if Blissey absolutely has to take on a Fighting- or Dark-type like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, or Weavile. Blissey's defensive profile makes it a liability into certain Ghost-types, specifically Dragon Dance Dragapult and Gholdengo. Kingambit is a great option that deals with the former two threats while also benefitting from Blissey bringing it in safely with Teleport. Other wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Medicham also appreciate pivot support and benefit from Blissey spreading Thunder Wave. A switch-in to powerful physical attackers, like Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Kingambit, is necessary. Options like Toxapex, Slowbro, Skarmory, and Great Tusk can help out on this front. Knock Off is irritating for Blissey, as losing its Heavy-Duty Boots is quite detrimental to its pivoting efforts.

Thunder Punch can be used to hit Slowbro, and in tandem with Electric Terrain, it can 2HKO Pokemon like Gholdengo and Victini. Alternatively, Thief can be used to immediately damage the aforementioned Pokemon, so it can use its STAB moves more. Due to Mega Medicham’s frailty and mediocre Speed tier, it is easily revenge killed. Defensive partners like Gholdengo, Ting-Lu, and Ferrothorn help check threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Knock Off and Pursuit users like Kingambit and Weavile also support Mega Medicham, as they break through Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon Mega Medicham struggle with, such as Slowbro, Victini, Gholdengo and Skeledirge, allowing it to consistently use its STAB attacks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn benefit Mega Medicham, as it forces a lot of switches and entry hazards wear down checks quickly. Tapu Koko is a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it handles Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Slowbro reliably and powers up Mega Medicham's Thunder Punch. Tapu Lele can also be a good partner for Mega Medicham, as it powers up Zen Headbutt to insane levels, but blocking Fake Out and Bullet Punch from being used can be problematic. Pokemon like Volcarona and Kartana appreciate Torandus-T, Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Gholdengo being pressured constantly by Mega Medicham, enabling them to wreak havoc once the checks are removed or chipped.</p> "

Alternatively, Ice Beam + Thunder can be used on Mega Latias to give it perfect coverage and let it threaten Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor, but it lacks immediate power, notably leaving it unable to threaten any Pursuit trappers. Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Toxapex form good defensive cores with Mega Latias, handling Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Kingambit for it while Mega Latias deals with Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos in return.

However, Mega Latios slightly suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, and while it cannot run all the coverage it wants, this doesn't hinder its effectiveness much. Aura Sphere is a must have in a tier plagued by Kingambit, as it easily Pursuit traps and KOes Mega Latios, and it also allows Mega Latios to hit other Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Mystical Fire allows it to secure the OHKO on Ferrothorn while also hitting Mega Scizor and Gholdengo, but it struggles more against the likes of Tera Grass Heatran, Dragonite, Tera Dragon Toxapex, and Slowbro. Ice Beam allows it to check Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Dragonite, but it will then have difficulty with the likes of Slowbro, Mega Scizor, and Gholdengo. Substitute lets it bypass status and also bait a Tera or Sucker Punch from Kingambit and neutralize the aforementioned Slowbro, but Mega Latios then gets walled by most, if not all, of the previously mentioned checks. Roost allows it to more consistently check Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Mega Charizard Y while also letting it consistently wallbreak throughout the course of a game. Mega Latios fits well on bulky offensive teams that can utilize its ability to break through defensive cores such as Toxapex and Gliscor, which opens up opportunities for allies like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to wallbreak as well. However, it is easily checked by faster threats that can OHKO it like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Dragapult, and many Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo and Tapu Lele. It is also walled by specific tanks like Heatran, Toxapex, Dragonite, or Slowbro, depending on its coverage. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can deal with the aforementioned Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Heatran, Clodsire, and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support is also incredible at allowing Mega Latios to rack up chip damage by the switches it naturally forces, and its checks like Heatran, Slowbro, and the like have reduced longevity when switching into hazards and become easier to break, so allies like Samurott-H, Landorus-T, or Heatran assist well. Mega Latios also pairs well with the likes of Tapu Lele and Kartana, weakening their shared Steel-type checks so that the latter two can clean up end-game.</p> "

Tera Steel improves Tangrowth's matchup against foes like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and non-Close Combat Mega Scizor, and it prevents it from being crippled by Toxapex, Clodsire, and Glimmora's poison. Teammates like Clodsire, Heatran, and Garganacl compensate for Tangrowth's exploitable special bulk by checking Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, respectively; in return, Tangrowth handles the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Mega Swampert. Due to its reliance on Regenerator for longevity, non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants enjoy hazard removal support from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk, with Tornadus-T in particular forming a sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth.</p> "

Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona, both impairing their longevity and increasing their susceptibility to entry hazards. Earthquake hits the likes of Heatran, Iron Moth, Kingambit and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while threatening to cripple switch-ins like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Focus Blast can also be used to snipe  Kingambit, or even Rock Slide to remove unsuspecting Volcarona that try to set up on the switch—the effectiveness of both options are highly matchup dependent, however. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground- and Dragon-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Gliscor, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Tera Steel is preferred to turn Tangrowth's common weaknesses into resistances, helping it sponge Ice coverage from Weavile, Baxcalibur, and Mega Swampert and Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Moreover, it can be used in a pinch to resist Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Tera Water turns the tide against threats such as Weavile and Heatran while maintaining Tangrowth's ability to check rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Heatran receives strong support from Tangrowth, as Tangrowth checks threats such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and pivots into foes with super effective coverage against Heatran, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. In return, Heatran checks Weavile, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T. Toxapex and Tornadus-T both benefit from Tangrowth's ability to pivot into threats such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W, with the former receiving the same level of support from Tangrowth as does Heatran. This trio comprises a formidable Regenerator core, with Toxapex removing Toxic Spikes and checking Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Weavile, and Tornadus-T providing valuable entry hazard removal to reinforce the longevity of the core. Tangrowth is susceptible to entry hazards, which can often put it into 2HKO range of certain attacks; therefore, it appreciates entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tornadus-T, as well as Rotom-W. Defensive cores supported by Tangrowth can fall victim to Kyurem as a result of its lethal coverage. Volcarona and Mega Scizor are teammates that can take advantage of Kyurem with their ability to set up and reliable recovery. With Tornadus-T forcing Tangrowth out, Rotom-W and Tapu Koko make for stellar teammates with their resistance to Hurricane and ability to pivot. In return, Tangrowth forces out Gastrodon, which otherwise checks the aforementioned teammates.</p> "

Its lack of use for its item slot after its activation combined with its Spikes immunity allows Gliscor to withstand weaker Knock Off attempts from Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor can use its longevity to act as an excellent Defog user, as it can outlast common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Alternatively, Gliscor can opt for Stealth Rock if its team prefers it over Defog. Roost keeps Gliscor healthy alongside Poison Heal, allowing it to drain the PP of moves such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Garganacl's Salt Cure. Toxic allows Gliscor to pressure common entry hazard setters and Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T. It also allows Gliscor to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Tapu Lele in a pinch. Tera Fairy gives Gliscor a generally solid defensive typing with few weaknesses, although at the cost of its Spikes immunity. The given HP EVs maximize Gliscor's recovery from Poison Heal and special bulk, with the remainder in Speed to outspeed Rotom-W. Gliscor fits best on defensive teams that appreciate its immense survivability and great support options. As such, Gliscor pairs well with sturdy physical and special walls, such as Skeledirge, Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clodsire, since its relatively unremarkable bulk puts it at risk of being overwhelmed often. In return, it can switch into weak attacks with problematic secondary effects, such as Toxapex's Scald and Garganacl's Salt Cure, as well as help teammates keep their held items by absorbing Knock Off. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Garganacl pair well with Gliscor's Defog support, while they act as threatening late-game wincons after Gliscor has worn down their checks. Gliscor pairs exceptionally well with Toxapex, as they form an incredibly sturdy pivoting core due to their incredible passive recovery.</p> "

Roost provides Gliscor with instant recovery, allowing it to check Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Heatran. The given EVs allow Gliscor to fulfill this purpose with Special Defense investment, with the HP maximizing its recovery from Poison Heal. Tera Fairy allows Gliscor to leverage a typing with few exploitable weaknesses, given Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo fear its Earthquake, while Tera Water improves Gliscor's matchup against Pokemon like Volcarona and Urshifu-R. However, it comes with more exploitable weaknesses, given the prominence of Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Ferrothorn. Gliscor fits best on balance and fat teams, which appreciate its ability to tear through opposing defensive cores while providing enough of a defensive backbone in return to facilitate this. Pokemon like Toxapex, Skarmory, and Gholdengo can exploit Gliscor's temporary checks such as Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Buzzwole, generating progress of their own. On the flip side, revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Dragapult can threaten offensive teams, given Gliscor's tendency to be overwhelmed when facing multiple strong wallbreakers.

Furthermore, offensive teams appreciate its ability to check a multitude of threats, such as Mega Scizor, Mega Swampert, and Heatran. Common entry hazard setters such as Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk value Rotom-W's STAB combination of Hydro Pump + Volt Switch, which naturally hits most hazard removers of the tier such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T for super effective damage, threatening them and keeping up hazards. This also helps teammates such as Urshifu-R, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Diancie wallbreak more easily, as the added chip helps in breaking down their checks. Pain Split is Rotom-W's main form of recovery, allowing it to keep itself healthy throughout a match, although it is shaky due to its inconsistency. Defog is also an option, further facilitating bringing frail teammates in safely; however, Rotom-W struggles to threaten the premier Defog blocker in Gholdengo, although it can pivot out of it with Volt Switch. Due to Dragon-types' natural resistance to Water- and Electric-type moves, Fairy- and Ice-types such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Weavile are extremely helpful in forcing progress against them. Rotom-W also struggles against Grass-types such as Kartana and Ferrothorn, which Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Mega Charizard Y help threaten, with Mega Scizor notably forming a powerful VoltTurn core with Rotom-W. Tera Steel is the preferred Tera type for Rotom-W, granting it a number of useful resistances such as to Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and Icicle Spear as well as Fairy-type STAB moves from Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Tera Steel also grants an immunity to Toxic from Pokemon like Clodsire, Gliscor, and Toxapex, which would otherwise severely dampen Rotom-W's lifespan. Tera Ghost is another great option in order to spinblock Great Tusk, wall Swords Dance Gliscor, and, in a pinch, gain an immunity to Fighting-type STAB moves from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, and Sneasler.</p> "

Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and remove defensive Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Toxapex, and Skeledirge. Taunt allows Heatran to deny recovery from Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Clodsire, and Zapdos, making trapping them much more efficient, though it has to Terastallize for the former two. Earth Power provides consistent damage versus Pokemon such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Gastrodon while also allowing Heatran to deal damage without running the risk of missing Magma Storm, particularly on its trapped opponents. Other options like Heavy Slam and Tera Blast can be considered to hit trapping targets such as Clefable and Alomomola. Tera Grass allows Heatran to invalidate typical counterplay such as Gastrodon and Clodsire while also avoiding being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Taunt further bolsters Heatran's effective use of Tera, as it can avoid one of its only potential flaws in becoming vulnerable to Toxic. Heatran can also use Toxic itself to threaten Pokemon using it to set up, such as Garchomp and Dragonite while reducing longevity of Pokemon such as Pelipper, Mega Swampert, and opposing Terastallized Heatran. Tera Grass in conjunction with Flash Fire gives Heatran a unique defensive profile that lets it wall Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and opposing Heatran. Heatran must be careful with Tera usage, as Tera Grass can leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Volcarona and Tornadus-T. The given EV spread allows Heatran to outspeed uninvested Gholdengo while maximizing special bulk. Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W appreciate Heatran’s ability to bait and remove popular Ground-types once Terastallized, such as Landorus-T, Clodsire, and Gastrodon, as well as heavily chippping Garchomp. Teammates such as Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Mega Lopunny appreciate Heatran's ability to check Tapu Lele, taking its often choice locked STAB attacks and setting Stealth Rock or firing off a Magma Storm to force progress, benefitting its teammates. Pokemon such as Dragonite and Garchomp can benefit Heatran defensively with both punishing physical attackers such as Mega-Lopunny while also capitalizing on its wallbreaking potential. Heatran is also able to bait and eliminate Tera Fairy Skeledirge for these aforementioned teammates. Rotom-W defensively supports Heatran by preventing it from immediately Terastallizing to beat Clodsire, opposing Rotom-W, and Landorus-T if not desired, providing a safe switch. Heatran struggles to stay healthy in certain matchups versus offensive entry hazard-stacking teams that deny it from coming in freely without seriously chipping itself, so Defoggers like Tornadus-T benefit Heatran while also providing a Ground immunity. Heatran can take advantage of Choice-locked Grass types such as Rillaboom and Kartana when they are trying to hit Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T particularly likes Heatran's ability to check Zapdos and Tapu Koko. Heatran appreciates Pokemon who can soak up Fighting-type moves such as Great Tusk and Tangrowth as Heatran tends to invite in particularly strong revenge killers like Mega-Lopunny and opposing Great Tusk.</p> "

Hidden Power Fighting is the preferred coverage move to hit Mega Tyranitar and Heatran much harder, while Moonblast provides a stronger hit against the likes of Dragapult and Urshifu-R if Cresselia cannot afford to accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts. Tera Poison is essential for removing Cresselia's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hisuian Samurott while providing less exploitable weaknesses compared to Tera Steel, which makes Cresselia prone to being revenge killed by Fighting- and Fire-types such as Mega Lopunny, Sneasler, Heatran, and Mega Charizard Y. Covert Cloak allows Cresselia to negate secondary effects from Garganacl's Salt Cure and status from the likes of Toxapex, Sneasler, and Zapdos, while Leftovers provides passive recovery that makes Cresselia less exploitable and forced to heal. Maximum Speed EVs allow Cresselia to consistently outspeed Heatran and Gholdengo, which could otherwise irritate it, although more Defense investment could be used instead to better withstand attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Cresselia fits best on either bulky balance or hyper offense teams, both able to provide support in different ways; the former give Cresselia a defensive core to fall back on should its sweep fail, while the latter pressure opposing defensive teams and can provide dual screens support via Tapu Koko and Dragapult to bolster its bulk even further. Both playstyles can reliably keep up Spikes using Skarmory, Clodsire, Mega Diancie, or Garchomp, which Cresselia mandates in order to wear down its checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Similarly, Knock Off support from the likes of Toxapex and Iron Valiant helps Cresselia pressure the aforementioned checks more effectively. Cresselia has difficulty withstanding rain teams due to them cutting Moonlight's healing, so defensive partners that match up positively against them such as Toxapex and Tera Water or Dragon Garganacl are appreciated.

Glare cripples common checks such as Tornadus-T, Volcarona, Skeledirge, and Victini, allowing Serperior or its teammates to muscle past them late-game. Hidden Power Fire hits common Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground threatens Heatran and Victini, although Tera Grass Heatran can still wall either variant. Both crucially provide it coverage to hit Gholdengo. Leftovers provides Serperior with longevity to use Substitute more freely and fully take advantage of Glare. Tera Grass amplifies the power of Leaf Storm, allowing Serperior to break past Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Toxapex with greater ease. The given EV spread ensures Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip never break Serperior's Substitute. Serperior fits best on offensive teams that enjoy it crippling common defensive staples while providing avenues for it to sweep late-game. Wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Kingambit enjoy Serperior slowing down teams with Glare, giving them more opportunities to outspeed and KO the opposition. Serperior pairs very well with entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Garchomp. Not only does it bait in and cripple the most common Defogger in Tornadus-T, but it also punishes general Defog attempts with Contrary's evasion boost, making it even more nightmarish to take down through paralysis and Substitute. Serperior can struggle to break past Pokemon like Heatran, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Clodsire even when they are paralyzed, so Pokemon that pressure them such as Urshifu-R, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele make for good teammates.</p> "

Steelium Z lets Excadrill muscle through Pokemon like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tangrowth, and Buzzwole, while Normalium Z + Giga Impact dents Zapdos and Pelipper harder. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to compress roles as an entry hazard remover. Toxic can be used to cripple Zapdos, Slowbro, Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Tangrowth, especially with sand damage. Jolly is the optimal nature for Excadrill to speed tie opposing Excadrill, though an Adamant nature can be used to maximize damage output. Excadrill requires sand to function, so Mega Tyranitar is mandatory. Mega Tyranitar can also handle Pokemon like Zapdos and Pursuit trap checks like Slowbro, as well as provide Stealth Rock to wear down Excadrill's checks. Pokemon that can handle physically defensive walls such as Tangrowth, Buzzwole, Skarmory, and Rotom-W for Excadrill, such as Zapdos and Tapu Lele, form solid offensive cores; it can deal with their checks like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Tyranitar in return. Excadrill is also susceptible to revenge killers like Mega Lopunny and Dragapult outside of sand, so switch-ins like Kingambit, Zamazenta, Ting-Lu, and Toxapex pair well with it.

It pairs well with the main sun setter, Mega Charizard Y, as it can switch into and threaten Mega Charizard Y’s checks such as Hippowdon, Heatran, and Clodsire; in return, Mega Charizard Y beats its checks like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor, if Hisuian Lilligant lacks Tera Blast. Solar Blade is used for raw power, although Leaf Blade is still an option for consistency outside sun. Tera Blast Fire, especially in sun, gives Lilligant a powerful third STAB option to punish foes that can tank its original STAB combination like Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Tera Poison Cresselia. Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p> "

Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p> "

Toxapex also makes a great partner, as the two together form a double Regenerator core that staves off residual damage from the likes of Garganacl and burns from opposing Toxapex and Gastrodon. Toxapex additionally pivots into many Pokemon that outspeed Tornadus-T, including Zamazenta, Dragapult, Weavile, and Barraskewda in rain.</p> "

U-turn allows Tornadus-T to pivot out of these attackers and bring in its own threatening teammates, such as Mega Diancie and Zamazenta, against passive switchins - such as Rotom-W and Heatran. Knock Off cripples offensive and defensive Pokemon alike, removing items such as Choice Specs from Dragapult, Leftovers from Rotom-W and Gholdengo, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Clodsire, allowing Tornadus-T's teammates to more easily withstand these Pokemon. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to threaten Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, preventing Ferrothorn from setting entry hazards and Scizor from using Tornadus-T as setup fodder. Alternatively, Superpower hits Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar much harder, exploiting their attempts to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T. Tera Steel allows Tornadus-T to withstand Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Tapu Lele and Dragapult in a pinch as well as Stealth Rock, while Tera Water provides a more solid overall defensive type with fewer exploitable weaknesses, as well as providing insurance against Volcarona. The given HP EVs maximize Tornadus-T's recovery from Regenerator, while the Speed EVs allow Tornadus-T to outspeed Iron Valiant. Tornadus-T fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its ability to withstand powerful special attackers while keeping momentum with U-turn. Wallbreakers such as Mega Diancie, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R enjoy Tornadus-T as a fallback measure, switching into revenge killers like Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Gholdengo appreciate the extra insurance Tornadus-T provides against special attackers, allowing them to run more physically defensive and offensive sets, respectively. Tornadus-T's Stealth Rock weakness means it can be difficult to pivot into entry with hazards up, so it pairs well with solid hazard removal options such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk. The aforementioned Pokemon also make up for Tornadus-T's relative physical frailty, being able to check the likes of Mega Lopunny and Dragonite.</p> "

Rocky Helmet is the preferred item for Landorus-T to punish physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Kartana; however, if it decides to opt for Defog, then Leftovers is preferred for reliable passive recovery.

Roost keeps Kyurem healthy throughout a game, allowing it to switch into Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Rotom-W multiple times. Heavy-Duty Boots improves Kyurem's longevity, allowing it to safely Roost in front of Pokemon like Mega Swampert. Alternatively, Never-Melt Ice boosts Kyurem's Ice-type STAB move, letting it 2HKO Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Ting-Lu and OHKO Rotom-W, but it leaves Kyurem very prone to entry hazards. A Timid nature allows Kyurem to outspeed Great Tusk, although the power boost of Modest comes with other upsides. Tera Ground gives Kyurem a stronger Earth Power that pressures Mega Scizor, Mega Tyranitar, and Gholdengo significantly more. It also guards against common revenge killing attempts from the likes of Iron Valiant and Dragapult at high HP and provides Kyurem with a Stealth Rock resistance if running Never-Melt Ice.

Freeze Dry + Earth Power grants Kyurem near-perfect coverage, with the former hitting Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and bulky Water-types like Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Toxapex, while the latter deals with Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Heatran, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. Tera Steel flips Kyurem's matchup against Fairy-, Rock-, and Steel-types attacks like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant's Moonblast, Mega Tyranitar's Stone Edge, and Kingambit's Iron Head, while Tera Fairy does so similarly with Fighting- and Dragon-type moves from Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Dragapult, the latter of which can bypass Kyurem's Substitute due to Infiltrator. The given HP EVs allow Kyurem to make 101 HP Substitutes, which prevents it from being broken by Chansey's Seismic Toss.

Dark Pulse gives Greninja a strong neutral STAB move to hit common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Rotom-W, additionally wielding a nasty flinch chance to potentially break through them. Water Shuriken gives Greninja a priority option, crucial for revenge killing weakened targets that outspeed it like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, as well as getting the jump on other priority moves such as Weavile's Ice Shard and the aforementioned Mega Lopunny's Quick Attack. Ice Beam is Greninja's coverage move of choice, being its strongest option versus Pokemon like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite. Tera Water is the preferred Tera type, giving a significant boost to both of Greninja's Water-type STAB moves to potentially secure KOs on targets like Mega Charizard Y in sun and Tapu Lele after a Battle Bond activation with Surf. Greninja can also serve as a potent albeit niche wallbreaker on rain teams, with rain boosting the power of its Water-type STAB moves to ridiculous levels. This allows teammates like Mega Swampert and Zapdos to clean up the weakened defensive cores consisting of Pokemon like Rotom-W and Galarian Slowking. However, Greninja alone can struggle to break through sturdier Water-resistant foes like Tera Water Garganacl, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, so teammates like Tapu Koko, Gholdengo, and Heatran that can capitalize on Greninja forcing these foes in function well as teammates on certain offensive compositions.</p> "

Its high-powered STAB moves—which can be boosted further by Swords Dance—hit almost the entire metagame neutrally; Acrobatics grants Hawlucha strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tornadus-T, Dragapult, and Tapu Lele, which is backed up by Close Combat to decimate Flying-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Mega Tyranitar.

Electric Seed helps against Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk and prevents revenge killing attempts from Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Weavile's Ice Shard, while Psychic Seed helps against Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Choice-locked Dragapult. Taunt or Substitute deals with problematic walls, ignoring status like Toxapex's Toxic and Skeledirge's Will-O-Wisp; Taunt also prevents their recovery and phazing as well as Defense-boosting attempts such as from Skarmory or Tera Water Buzzwole, while Substitute blocks Landorus-T's Intimidate and punishes the use of weak attacks like its U-turn, Garganacl's Salt Cure, and Alomomola's Scald. The bulk investment allows Hawlucha to survive Clefable's Moonblast, which is unnecessary if running Psychic Seed. 176 Speed EVs can be used instead to revenge kill +1 Dragon Dance Dragapult.

Although Toxapex rarely Terastallizes, Tera Dragon ensures Rotom-W's Volt Switch never outdamages Regenerator while also removing its Ground and Electric weaknesses against the likes of Great Tusk and Tapu Koko.

Its ability to set up on common Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona and to potentially use Tera Steel to ignore Toxic from defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex allows it to start wallbreaking very early with its powerful coverage. Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more.

Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-o’s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-o’s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep.

Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it.

Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-o’s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute —namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p> "

Tera Grass boosts the power of Grass Knot while granting Tapu Koko key resistances, allowing it to lure foes such as Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Mega Swampert, all while improving its matchup against Rotom-W. Tapu Koko must be careful when using Tera, however, as it becomes unable to safely switch into Tornadus-T once it Terastallizes. Pokemon that utilize Electric Terrain such as Iron Valiant, Iron Hands, and Mega Medicham make for excellent teammates, as it activates Quark Drive for the former two and increases the power of Thunder Punch for the latter, 2HKOing foes such as Gholdengo. Tapu Koko also forms strong pivoting cores with teammates like Tornadus-T and Mega Lopunny, which take advantage of its checks such as Ferrothorn and Clodsire to generate momentum.

However, Tapu Lele’s mediocre Speed stat holds it back from being too overwhelming, as it is easily revenge killed by a plethora of faster Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire lets Tapu Lele pressure most Steel-types and puts them easily in the range of its STAB attacks, namely Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast instead lets Tapu Lele nail Heatran while missing out on Gholdengo and making Mega Scizor shakier to deal with. Psyshock lets Tapu Lele score an OHKO on Assault Vest Tornadus-T, preventing it from pivoting in to scout. Timid is the preferred nature to outrun Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Speed tie opposing Tapu Lele; however, the damage boost from a Modest nature might also be preferable, most notably 2HKOing Mega Scizor with Focus Blast and 2HKOing Bulky Gholdengo with Hidden Power Fire. Tapu Lele greatly appreciates pivot support to bring it in and punch holes, so the likes of Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W are good partners. Pursuit support from Kingambit and Mega Tyranitar is extremely useful, as they help remove Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo that can cause issues for Tapu Lele. Late-game cleaners like Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, and Volcarona all appreciate Tapu Lele wallbreaking early. Volcarona in particular synergises extremely well, as Tapu Lele heavily presaures Heatran, allowing Volcarona to break through it later on. Due to its low speed, Tapu Lele is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Dragapult, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R, so a solid defensive core formed with Pokemon like Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Kingambit works well alongside it. Steel-types like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Mega Scizor still act as a stopgap for Tapu Lele, so teammates like Urshifu-R, Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Valiant are desirable.</p> "

Other than shutting down problematic setup sweepers like Volcarona, Trick + Taunt improves Tapu Fini's matchup against defensive Pokemon by crippling and shutting down switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Clodsire, and Toxapex, especially with Misty Terrain to protect it and its teammates against theirs and the likes of Rotom-W, Heatran, and Gastrodon's status moves. If the team lacks an entry hazard remover, Tapu Fini can run Defog if necessary, as it matches up well against entry hazard setters like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. However, its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and lack of longevity make it a poor candidate to do it consistently. Ice Beam can be run to potentially 2HKO offensive Tornadus-T and OHKO Landorus-T, while Nature's Madness is an option to dent its checks hard—especially ones that lack reliable recovery—such as Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. However, forgoing Taunt or Defog loses out on Tapu Fini's utility, which makes shutting down walls and supporting its team needlessly more difficult. Tera Steel allows Tapu Fini to emergency check threats like Tapu Lele and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T; it also provides a better defensive typing against walls like Toxapex and Ferrothorn, which is more useful if using Taunt.

U-turn lets Cinderace generate momentum, pivoting on switch-ins such as Toxapex and Slowbro to bring in teammates like Tapu Koko and Gholdengo that can handle them. Sucker Punch lets Cinderace threaten Dragapult, which would otherwise revenge kill it. Tera Fire boosts Pyro Ball's power, allowing Cinderace to 2HKO foes such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Tera Fairy Garganacl after Stealth Rock. Cinderace must careful when using Tera, however, as Libero will no longer activate, leaving it more vulnerable to foes such as Rotom-W. Cinderace fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its pivoting ability. Tapu Koko forms a potent pivoting core with Cinderace, taking advantage of foes such as Toxapex and Rotom-W while granting Cinderace free entry against foes such as Ferrothorn and Tangrowth. They also overwhelm foes such as Ladorus-T, Gastrodon, and Great Tusk together. Cinderace also appreciates teammates such as Ferrothorn and Gastrodon providing entry hazard support to weaken foes such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk while also checking foes such as Rotom-W and Urshifu-R. Dragapult appreciates Cinderace handling foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit; in return, it threatens foes such as Skeledirge, which Cinderace struggles against. Future Sight support from teammates such as Slowbro and Tapu Lele helps pressure foes such as Toxapex for Cinderace; in return, Cinderace handles foes that threaten them such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> "

It also individually beats hazard setters like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Clodsire. Brave Bird is the preferred option that pressures Dragapult, Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, while Body Press pressures Kingambit, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Weavile. Iron Defense or Bulk Up can be used over Defog to turn Corviknight into a bulky win condition and to improve its ability to check threats like Kingambit, Urshifu-R, and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Body Press should be used with Iron Defense, while Brave Bird can instead be used with Bulk Up. U-turn allows Corviknight to maintain momentum against the threats that it checks while also bringing in frailer teammates. The given HP and Defense EVs allow Corviknight to live a +2 Continental Crush from Landorus-T, while the rest of the EVs being in Special Defense helps out against Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Rocky Helmet allows Corviknight to chip threats like Mega Lopunny and Weavile. Tera Dragon removes Corviknight's Electric and Fire weaknesses and potentially allows it to turn the tables on Heatran and Rotom-W. Tera Ground can instead be used to halt Volt Switch attempts and surprise Tapu Koko, but the resistances it grants are not as consistently valuable as Dragon. Corviknight's biggest problem by far is Gholdengo, which blocks Corviknight's Defog attempts and sets up on it. Options that deal with it, such as Kingambit, Weavile, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire are therefore mandatory partners. U-turn can bring in the former two to Pursuit trap Gholdengo, while the latter two can stave it off defensively. Kingambit is especially potent with Corviknight, as it appreciates Corviknight's Rocky Helmet applying chip damage onto its checks like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta. U-turn can also bring in other threats safely, such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Heatran. Corviknight's defensive profile gets taken advantage of by threats like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona, so options such as your own Heatran, Garchomp, and Toxapex can help out in this regard.</p> "

It also provides a sturdy defensive backbone, consistently checking threats such as Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Dragonite. However, as Corviknight lacks immediate offensive presence and coverage, it suffers from being forced out by the likes of Zapdos and Heatran and being setup fodder from the likes of Kingambit and Gholdengo. Pressure, in conjunction with Substitute, allows Corviknight to PP stall checks like Heatran and Skarmory safely while bypassing status moves like Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp and Clefable's Thunder Wave. Tera Water improves the matchup against Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R, giving crucial resistances to safely let Corviknight boost up. Alternatively, Tera Dragon lets it take on Electric-types like Zapdos and Rotom-W while also helping against Heatran and Urshifu-R. However, Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Weavile, and Dragapult can now almost always force it out, though they do have to watch out for repeated Brave Bird hits. The given EV spread maximizes special bulk while still being able to survive a +2 Continental Crush from Garchomp followed by Stone Edge after Roost; it also lets Corviknight outspeed Skarmory and become only 3HKOed by Great Tusk's Close Combat. However, note that Corviknight will be taking a super effective Body Press from Skarmory after using Roost. Corviknight fits best on bulkier teams, which appreciate its ability to PP stall threats like Heatran and Toxapex while being a solid wincon. Pokemon like Toxapex and Clefable thus work well with it. Toxapex appreciates Corviknight reliably checking Tapu Lele and Landorus-T for it. In return, Toxapex helps check Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, which Corviknight struggles to do. Calm Mind Clefable loves Corviknight draining PP from opposing Toxapex’s Haze; in return, it softens up Heatran. Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk make excellent partners, as they absorb Electric attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko and remove entry hazards from the field. In exchange, Corviknight helps take Kyurem and Iron Valiant’s attacks. Due to Corviknight being walled by Electric- and Steel-types, such as Zapdos and Gholdengo, partners that can threaten them such as Mega Tyranitar and Heatran work well with it.</p> "

Its blistering Speed tier allows it to nearly outpace the entire metagame under rain, including boosted foes like Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mega Swampert. Liquidation's Defense drop lets it potentially 2HKO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper, while Waterfall's flinches gives Barraskewda slightly better odds to muscle past the likes of Slowbro and Toxapex. Flip Turn keeps up momentum by providing free entry for its teammates while chipping down switch-ins like Dondozo and Tangrowth. Close Combat hits Water-resistant foes such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Gyarados, and it provides strong neutral coverage against the likes of Tera Water Great Tusk, Tera Grass Volcarona, and Gastrodon. Aqua Jet prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by priority attacks like Kingambit and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch and—if rain is not active—lets it pick off faster threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and boosted Volcarona and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs pressures Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Water Absorb Clodsire better. Tera Water skyrockets Barraskewda's rain-boosted STAB moves further, potentially 2HKOing even Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Pelipper is a necessary teammate that spearheads rain teams by reliably summoning rain with Drizzle. Mega Swampert is a fantastic offensive partner that can overwhelm shared checks like Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Slowbro and appreciates Barraskewda's Flip Turn to bring it in safely on foes such as Toxapex, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn are rain team staples that support Barraskewda with Knock Off, crippling walls such as Rotom-W and opposing Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn in particular helps threaten Gastrodon with Power Whip and sets entry hazards to soften up foes. The aforementioned Pelipper and Tornadus-T also provide Defog support for Barraskewda to pivot throughout the game unperturbed, bring it in safely via U-turn, and threatens problematic Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tera Grass Heatran.</p> "

Healing Wish gives Hatterene the ability to fully heal one of its teammates, giving wallbreakers and setup Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Kingambit another chance to break through the opposing team. Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult. Nuzzle provides Hatterene with a way to punish Pokemon that would safely pivot into it otherwise, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T. Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex while maximizing its ability to pivot into physical attacks. Hatterene greatly benefits teams that rely on keeping entry hazards off the field, such as sun teams and some offense teams. As such, Mega Charizard Y is a fantastic partner, as it appreciates Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field and walling Toxapex; in return, it is able to pressure Pokemon Hatterene brings in, such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Focus Sash users such as Polteageist and Cloyster also make for good teammates thanks to Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards. Similarly, pivots such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult appreciate Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards and give them a second chance with Healing Wish, letting them come in safely and consistently. Hatterene's lack of longevity means that it usually cannot act as the sole form of hazard control. As such, Rapid Spin Great Tusk is a good partner alongside Hatterene for keeping hazards off of the field while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y on sun teams.</p> "

Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire hits Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ferrothorn super effectively. Draining Kiss acts as a form of recovery for Hatterene. Tera Water gives Hatterene a solid defensive typing while removing its weakness to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex, letting Hatterene take out Toxapex with an attack before having its boosts removed by Haze. Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T appreciates Hatterene being able to Terastallize to force opposing Gholdengo to Terastallize, as well as keeping hazards off the field for it. Kingambit and Garganacl are great partners for their ability to reliably check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo, with Kingambit even being able to Pursuit trap them. Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor can check Kingambit for Hatterene as well. Hatterene's lack of longevity outside of Draining Kiss means that it appreciates a secondary form of entry hazard removal from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Hatterene enjoys pairing up with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as they pressure the opponent into using Defog, alleviating Hatterene's need to block entry hazards, as well as wearing down Hatterene's answers such as Heatran and Gholdengo.</p> "

It also prevents foes such as Volcarona and Annihilape from using Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Spirit Break chips foes such as Ting-Lu and makes it easier to set up dual screens in front of special attackers such as Tapu Lele. Parting Shot can be used to pivot into teammates such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Mega Scizor after setting screens, but it lets Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile—as well as Annihilape—exploit it, hindering its effectiveness. Superpower lets Grimmsnarl OHKO Kingambit after Stealth Rock, but it is ineffective outside of this matchup and is hard to justify over other alternatives. Grimmsnarl will very rarely Terastallize since teammates such as Dragonite take advantage of it far better. In a pinch, however, Tera Steel reverses its weaknesses and provides an overall solid defensive typing, which helps against foes such as Tapu Lele and Gholdengo. Tera Ghost is an alternative that prevents opposing Great Tusk from removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Teammates that take advantage of dual screen support such as Mega Scizor, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Kingambit make good partners, setting up safely and avoiding potential revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and opposing Kingambit. Mega Scizor is a particularly good partner, handling foes such as Kingambit that use Grimmsnarl as setup fodder. Grimmsnarl has difficulty denying entry hazards from foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu, so it appreciates teammates such as Cyclizar clearing hazards from the field.

Slush Rush lets Arctozolt outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under snow, including foes such as Dragapult and Weavile, though its inability to outspeed boosted foes such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and its pitiful Speed outside of snow hinders its sweeping potential. Freeze-Dry is an alternative to Blizzard that lets Arctozolt break through foes such as Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, but the lack of consistency outside of these matchups makes it a less desirable choice. Low Kick provides coverage for foes such as Ferrothorn, Kingambit, and Mega Tyranitar. Substitute takes advantage of forced switches against foes such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Tornadus-T to ease prediction and avoid potential revenge killers such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lopunny. The Defense boost from snow also helps preserve Arctozolt's Substitute, granting it more safe turns. Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates Arctozolt's major Stealth Rock weakness, granting it more opportunities to wallbreak. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used with entry hazard control to improve Arctozolt's longevity and grant more opportunities to use Substitute. Tera Electric is used to boost Bolt Beak's power and remove Arctozolt's weakness to Stealth Rock, but it loses the Defense boost from snow. Slowking is a mandatory teammate to support Arctozolt, setting snow and acting as a slow pivot to grant it safe entry. Mega Diancie provides entry hazard support to weaken foes such as Ferrothorn and helps deny opposing entry hazards for Arctozolt. Arctozolt struggles against revenge killers such as Mega Scizor and Choice Scarf Kartana, so it appreciates teammates such as Heatran and Tornadus-T handling them.

After a Dragon Dance, Dragapult outspeeds all Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users, such as Kartana, Greninja, and Iron Valiant, making it extremely hard to stop if it sets up successfully. Ghostium Z-powered Phantom Force enables a boosted Dragapult to blast through bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran after slight chip damage. Dragapult's typing gives it opportunities to switch in and set up against certain Pokemon such as Volcarona, non-Ice Spinner Dragonite, and Urshifu-R locked into a Fighting-type move. Substitute is the preferred option in the last moveslot to ease prediction and facilitate setup while also avoiding priority. Substitute also allows Dragapult to play mind games with Kingambit. Fire Blast is another option that allows Dragapult to deal massive damage to physically defensive Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, both of which can survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare at full health. Clear Body is the preferred ability to avoid stat drops from Intimidate, but Infiltrator can also be used to improve the matchup against dual screens teams. A Jolly nature lets Dragapult outspeed Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko prior to setting up. Dragon Dance Dragapult fits best on offensive teams, where it can function as a potent late-game cleaner with its Z-Move. Entry hazard support from Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Glimmora can help chip bulky foes such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit into range of Dragapult's attacks. Gholdengo can block attempts to remove entry hazards, as well as pressure certain physical walls that give Dragapult a hard time, such as Ferrothorn. Dragapult can struggle with bulky physical walls such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and post-Tera Skeledirge, so powerful special wallbreakers that can take advantage of these Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, are greatly appreciated. Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain, which thwarts revenge killing attempts from priority moves.

Will-O-Wisp boosts Hex to monstrous levels and threatens to pacify physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Dragon Darts is a strong physical move to better hit special walls like Clodsire, forcing it to recover lest Dragapult's teammates like Iron Valiant break through.

Tera Steel and Electric let it Substitute on its checks like Tapu Lele and Zapdos safely. It is especially effective when paired with Protect and Substitute, as it can easily waste rain turns. While very threatening, this set tends to struggle against walls such as Skeledirge, Dondozo, and Clefable, so Pokemon that pressure them such as Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Heatran are great partners. If not using Crunch, Pursuit support from Kingambit and Weavile should be used to remove Ghost-types that Zamazenta can't touch. Since this set struggles against Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, Knock Off support from Kartana and the aforementioned Kingambit helps in dealing with them.</p> "

Swords Dance on top of very strong Base Power moves in Surging Strikes and Close Combat means that Urshifu-R can effectively break through a variety of defensive cores, especially with Terastallization. This includes Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Unaware Clodsire. Urshifu-R's Water / Fighting typing gives it chances to pivot into offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Mega Scizor, providing it defensive utility as well. Taunt lets Urshifu-R pressure defensive Pokemon and prevent Toxic and Haze from being used while negating recovery on checks without Regenerator such as Pelipper, Dragonite, and Buzzwole. Ice Punch pressures checks such as Dragonite and Dragapult. A boosted Aqua Jet is able to KO a chipped Tapu Koko, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny, especially with support from Pelipper's rain and Tera Water. Thunder Punch can be used to pressure or break through bulky Water-types that would normally wall Urshifu-R, such as Pelipper, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Slowbro, and Dondozo. Punching Gloves is the preferred option for boosting both Thunder Punch's and Surging Strikes's base power and preventing Rocky Helmet recoil. Swords Dance- and Tera Water-boosted Surging Strikes is able to break past checks such as Buzzwole, Dragonite, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Iron Hands, especially when supported by rain from Pelipper. Pelipper is one of the best partners for Urshifu-R because it provides rain support, boosting Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes to absurd levels. Tornadus-T is a great teammate for Urshifu-R, as it appreciates Urshifu-R's ability to break past Ferrothorn, Clodsire, Garchomp, and Blissey while soft checking Weavile and Tyranitar. In return, Tornadus-T with Taunt is able to take on defensive Water-types such as Dondozo and Toxapex as well as Kartana. Tornadus-T can also utilize Supersonic Skystrike to break shared checks such as Tapu Koko and Toxapex. Mega Diancie, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp are valuable partners for setting entry hazards to wear down Urshifu-R's checks such as Buzzwole, Dragapult, and Tangrowth. Tapu Koko is another synergistic partner for being able to pivot into Toxapex and other defensive Water-types. Future Sight support from Tapu Lele and Slowbro is much appreciated to make it easier for Urshifu-R to take on Dondozo, Tangrowth, Toxapex, and Buzzwole without using Terastallization or Swords Dance. Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult are also threats, since they resist all of Urshifu-R's common moves bar Ice Punch, can threaten it out with Choice Specs-boosted attacks in Dragapult's case, or Dragon Dance in front of Urshifu-R, though Dragapult cannot switch into Urshifu-R multiple times. Garganacl also acts as a consistent check to Dragapult, sets Stealth Rock for Urshifu-R, provides a consistent switch-in to Skeledirge, as well as Toxapex and Dondozo when Terastallized into a Fairy- or Water-type, and pressures them for Urshifu-R with Salt Cure. If not running Taunt, Swords Dance Urshifu-R struggles with bulky Unaware threats like Tera Fairy Skeledirge and Dondozo, so special wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, Tera Grass Heatran, and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T are appreciated.</p> "

Urshifu-R can pivot into offensive Pokemon such as Weavile and Mega Scizor, but prefers to not lose its item. Since Urshifu-R forces switches with its STAB combo, U-turn is an excellent move to generate momentum on these switches, letting it bring in a teammate. Aqua Jet allows for Urshifu-R to KO a chipped Tapu Koko, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and pre-Tera Volcarona. Ice Punch hits Dragapult and Dragonite super effectively. Tera Water is the preferred Tera type, as once Rocky Helmet users are knocked off by a supporting partner and Garchomp and Ferrothorn are dealt with, Tera Water-boosted Surging Strikes can overwhelm checks such as Pelipper, Tera Water Garganacl, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Slowbro, especially with support from Pelipper's rain. Pelipper is a fantastic partner for Urshifu-R by virtue of it providing rain, which strengthens Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. Entry hazard setters such as Glimmora, Garchomp, Clodsire, and Ferrothorn can help in wearing down its checks. Tapu Lele is a fantastic partner by providing Future Sight support, which lets Urshifu-R beat checks like Dragonite, Skeledirge, and Toxapex for Urshifu-R, as well as appreciating Urshifu-R's ability to pivot into Heatran and take on Ferrothorn. Urshifu-R struggles with defensive Water-types and Tangrowth, so partners such as Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T pair well with it. Tapu Koko also forms a pivot core with it, being able to consistently switch into Toxapex and Slowbro, and powering up Urshifu-R's Thunder Punch, while Urshifu-R pressures Ferrothorn for Tapu Koko. Tornadus-T is able to pressure defensive Water-types such as Toxapex with Taunt, check Kartana, remove entry hazards so that Urshifu-R can come in more often, bring Urshifu-R in with U-turn, and even utilize Supersonic Skystrike to break past shared checks such as Tapu Koko and the aforementioned defensive Water-types. Tornadus-T also appreciates Urshifu-R's ability to break Ferrothorn, while soft checking Tyranitar and Weavile. Urshifu-R struggles with Dragonite, so it appreciate partners such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Pelipper, or Tera Fairy/Water Garganacl to help take on Dragonite. Rocky Helmet users such as Garchomp and Buzzwole make it harder for Urshifu-R to freely use Surging Strikes, so Knock Off support from users such as Weavile and Toxapex is much appreciated. Weavile in particular is able to take on Tornadus-T, Tangrowth, Dragonite, and Garchomp while also pressuring Toxapex. Urshifu-R is forced out by faster special attackers such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Tornadus-T, so Ferrothorn and Heatran are great partners for taking on these Pokemon and also providing entry hazard support. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Dragapult are good partners for being able to bring in Urshifu-R consistently throughout a game to wallbreak.</p> "

U-turn is integral, providing valuable pivoting potential on checks like Toxapex and Slowbro and serving as a midground into contact punishment from the likes of Ferrothorn and Garchomp. Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to halt Volcarona as well as pick off weakened sweepers such as Sneasler. Alternatively, Ice Spinner can be used to hit Dragon-types like Dragapult, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Additionally, Thunder Punch is a niche option to hit slightly harder against Slowbro and Toxapex. Tera Water boosts damage from Surging Strikes to ludicrous levels, as well as strengthening Aqua Jet to pick off bulkier sweepers like Iron Valiant. Teammates such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Heatran appreciate Urshifu-R's ability to pivot out on Toxapex in particular, letting them freely fire off attacks and maintain momentum. Additionally, Tapu Lele can also use Future Sight to let Urshifu-R bypass normal checks like Buzzwole and the aforementioned Toxapex. Contact punishment from Pokemon like Skarmory and Garchomp is problematic, but can be circumvented with teammates who can remove their Rocky Helmet such as Kartana, Kingambit, and Tornadus-T. Tornadus-T makes for a great teammate particularly, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Dragonite and Toxapex, allowing Urshifu-R to rack up more significant damage against them.</p> "

Choice Band is the preferred item for more power so long as it has pivots to fall back on, such as Pelipper, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos. Tera Water is the premier Tera option to pump as much power into Wave Crash as possible, allowing it to 2HKO even Water-resistant foes such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Tera Water also removes its weakness to Sucker Punch from the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, and it maintains its resistance to Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, although it removes its immunity to Fake Out from Mega Medicham. This also leaves Basculegion-M susceptible to Wave Crash's heavy recoil damage, so Liquidation is used to mitigate this, and it should be used once Basculegion-M’s checks have been worn down in order to ensure that it does not KO itself with recoil. Basculegion-M thus benefits from an offensive partner like Mega Swampert, which can finish off threats weakened by Basculegion-M. Pelipper is necessary to set up rain for Basculegion-M and also serves as a pivot to give it a free switch, something Basculegion-M has trouble doing, as it prefers to preserve its HP for recoil. Other pivots like Eject Button Ferrothorn and Tornadus-T are also helpful to support Basculegion-M by giving a point of entry to start breaking.</p> "

Its access to Swift Swim as well as strong STAB options in Surf and Shadow Ball allows it to be immensely threatening once it's brought in, and its ability to hit hard on the special side allows it to pick up 2HKOs on many common Water resistances in the tier such as Rotom-W or Toxapex. Swift Swim is a fantastic ability for Basculegion-F, as it allows the capability to run a Modest nature over Timid, boosting Basculegion-F's breaking capabilities even further. A Speed-boosting nature is unnecessary due to hitting a whopping 510 Speed in rain, outrunning almost every Pokemon in the tier except for Choice Scarf Kartana and Iron Valiant in Electric Terrain. Surf is a great option as a reliable STAB move, because its above-average Base Power and perfect accuracy allow it to be spammed with little to no drawback, while Hydro Pump is a great option for the raw power, 2HKOing Tera Grass Heatran with minimal chip damage and OHKOing Mega Charizard Y in sun. Both of these moves are perfectly complemented by Basculegion-F's secondary STAB option, Shadow Ball, which provides neutral coverage against a majority of the metagame. Very few Pokemon can resist Basculegion-F's STAB combination, which is even further bolstered by Ice Beam as a coverage option. Ice Beam allows Basculegion-F to deal serious damage to Pokemon like Tera Grass Heatran and Dragonite. Basculegion-F is also a phenomenal Terastallization user, as it's able to use Tera Water to both shed its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch and boost Surf to terrifying levels of power, making it capable of sweeping most teams with little to no chip damage. Basculegion-F pairs extremely well with Pelipper, since it's able to set rain and use U-turn to bring Basculegion-F in safely. It also appreciates support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Zapdos, as Ferrothorn can answer Iron Valiant's Moonblast and spread chip damage very effectively with Iron Barbs, and Zapdos can check Choice Scarf Kartana and Rillaboom defensively and threaten crippling paralyses. In turn, Basculegion-F supports them back by KOing Pokemon that'd normally be able to force them out or pivot around utilizing resistances and immunities. For example, it can bait Leaf Blade from Kartana to guarantee a safe switch into Zapdos or it can lure Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, allowing Ferrothorn to come in and start spreading chip damage.</p> "

Dire Claw is generally preferred over Gunk Shot for its perfect accuracy and a high chance to cripple the target with status. However, Gunk Shot has considerably more power, allowing Sneasler to OHKO most Zapdos at +2. Acrobatics is Sneasler's most spammable attack, especially if it has Terastallized, as it hits many neutral targets such as Tornadus, Dragapult, and Toxapex for high damage. Sneasler should be brought out when the Terrain matching its item is active, consuming its item and boosting Acrobatics. An Electric Seed or Psychic Seed is recommended to instantly activate Unburden, and the boost to Sneasler's otherwise poor defenses may also facilitate setup. Tera Flying turns Sneasler's Ground weakness into an immunity, which often buys it a turn to set up. Tera Flying also grants STAB on Acrobatics, allowing Sneasler to OHKO Dragapult and physically defensive Great Tusk with Acrobatics after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Sneasler serves as an excellent late-game cleaner on hyper offense teams. Entry hazard setters such as Mega Diancie or Landorus-T are useful teammates to help wear down Snealser's checks, such as Toxapex and opposing Landorus-T, into KO range for its attacks. Given Sneasler's item, a Terrain-setting partner such as Tapu Koko or Tapu Lele is mandatory. Tapu Koko provides entry opporunities with Volt Switch and U-turn while also setting Reflect and Light Screen, which facilitates setup. Tapu Lele pressures Toxapex, and its Psychic Terrain blocks priority attacks such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Fake Out from Mega Lopunny, and Sucker Punch from Kingambit, all of which can otherwise pick off a weakened Sneasler. However, one should be aware that Psychic Terrain will no longer block priority moves against a Tera Flying Snealser that has Terastallized. Other offensive partners that synergize well with Sneasler include Kingambit, Dragonite, and Volcarona, all of which can either assist in breaking through Sneasler's checks, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, or Toxapex, or finish off a team weakened by Sneasler.</p> "

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Sneasler to ignore Stealth Rock and Spikes to continue switching in and retain its offensive presence throughout the game. However, Sneasler is also hindered by contact punishment from the likes of Ferrothorn, defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp, and Zapdos, so Protective Pads helps provide more longevity. U-turn allows Sneasler to function as a pivot, bringing in other offensive threats such as Dragapult along with other special attackers like Tapu Lele to take advantage of physical tanks that can wall Sneasler such as Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. U-turn also allows it to easily spread poison with Poison Touch. Fake Out allows Sneasler to safely chip and poison faster threats like offensive Tornadus-T and Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R or Landorus-T, along with powerful priority users like Extreme Killer Dragonite. As such, Sneasler benefits from having a sturdy defensive backbone with Pokemon like Toxapex or Ferrothorn to tank hits that Sneasler dislikes. Sneasler also forces a lot of switches, so it benefits from allies that can set hazards like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Heatran, which also switch in on Flying- and Psychic-type moves for Sneasler. Sneasler also has a tendency to be completely walled by the likes of Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T and benefits greatly from having allies that it can pivot to in order to exploit these checks for damage, like Tapu Lele or Zapdos.</p> "

Protect allows Garganacl to accrue more recovery from Leftovers and scout Pokemon like Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult, all while accruing chip damage on them with Salt Cure. Recover maintains Garganacl's longevity against Pokemon like Dragapult and Tapu Koko. Tera Water gives it neat resistances to Gholdengo's Make It Rain and Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes while also improving its matchup against rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert and Floatzel. Tera Fairy lets it handle Pokemon like Tera Grass Volcarona and Zamazenta safely, and it renders Dragapult useless against it. Maximum Special Defense investment allows Garganacl to deal with Pokemon like Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele reliably. Pokemon like Toxapex, Kingambit, and Gholdengo support Garganacl as they deal with strong wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Gholdengo, and Tapu Lele; Gholdengo in particular makes an amazing teammate as it prevents Defog and Rapid Spin from clearing Garganacl's Stealth Rock while also dealing with Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Kartana. Garganacl appreciates Knock Off users such as Tornadus-T and Toxapex, as they let it beat Regenerator Pokemon such as Slowbro and Toxapex with its own entry hazards. Pokemon that like their defensive checks being worn down due to Stealth Rock and Salt Cure such as Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham appreciate Garganacl's presence, as it wears down Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Gholdengo.</p> "

Power Gem threatens the metagame's best Defogger in Tornadus-T, while Sludge Bomb dents screens setters such as Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko and—if Focus Sash is still intact—Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant as well, which can be problematic against offensive teams. Earth Power pressures Steel-types like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Kingambit that would otherwise block Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Energy Ball deals with other entry hazard setters and removers such as Great Tusk, Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Rotom-W. Focus Sash guarantees that Glimmora can set at least one layer of entry hazards, potentially letting Toxic Debris trigger twice as well. Tera Ghost is used in a pinch to spinblock foes such as Great Tusk and Excadrill and remove its Ground weakness to set up multiple entry hazards in the face of other setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gastrodon. Gholdengo is a near-mandatory teammate to keep up entry hazards by blocking every attempts to remove them, such as Defog and Rapid Spin. Setup sweepers like Kingambit, Volcarona, Dragapult, Dragonite, and Iron Valiant appreciate entry hazards wearing down foes such as Dondozo and Clodsire and not being chipped down by opposing ones themselves; particularly, Kingambit's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Volcarona to make them vulnerable to Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> "

However, Stealth Rock can be used if Clodsire's team requires it. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Clodsire, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Great Tusk. Poison Jab can be used to poison post-Tera Gholdengo attempting to remove its Ground weakness, and it forces damage on Tornadus-T faster. Heavy-Duty Boots are preferred on Clodsire to negate its weakness to opposing Spikes teams, although Leftovers are also viable to increase Clodsire's longevity. Unaware is preferred over Water Absorb to negate Clodsire's passivity against setup sweepers, and Water Absorb does little to help against the likes of Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Tera Dark grants Clodsire a Ghost resistance, which helps against Choice Specs Dragapult and Gholdengo, especially if using Poison Jab against the latter.

Headlong Rush is an amazing STAB move, letting Great Tusk force out Pokemon such as Heatran, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge very well. Earthquake can be used for a no-drawback STAB move, but the lack in power is certainly noticeable. Close Combat allows Great Tusk to annihilate Pokemon like Kingambit, and Ferrothorn, and it does a nice chunk to Rotom-W on the switch. Rapid Spin provides reliable entry hazard control, which is especially useful because Great Tusk forces out common Stealth Rock users like Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. It also lets Great Tusk outspeed foes like Iron Valiant, non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T. Ice Spinner lets Great Tusk hit Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Tornadus-T for good damage. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Great Tusk an entry hazard immunity and allows it to safely Rapid Spin, while Leftovers gives it passive recovery and lets it reliably check Pokemon like Kingambit and Garchomp. Icium Z allows Great Tusk to immediately remove Pokemon like Garchomp and Tornadus while also taking advantage of Tera Grass Heatran. Booster Energy can be used to improve Great Tusk's already great offensive output, but since it is a one-time use item, it can be quite unreliable. Tera Water improves the matchup into Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Floatzel. Tera Ground removes Great Tusk's Fairy and Psychic weakness and bolsters its offensive output, letting it OHKO Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Volcarona. Tera Steel gives Great Tusk resistances to the majority of its weaknesses, letting it KO Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko after luring them. Gholdengo and Kingambit make excellent partners for Great Tusk, as Gholdengo safely handles Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant while Kingambit can force out and Pursuit Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Dragapult. Great Tusk is commonly used as setup fodder against Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, so partners like Clodsire and Dragonite can support it in that case.

Dazzling Gleam punishes Great Tusk and Iron Valiant and prevents them from freely exploiting Scream Tail. Encore pairs excellently with Scream Tail's high Speed, allowing it to shut down setup sweepers such as Urshifu-R, Cresselia, and Garchomp for its teammates to defeat. Leftovers provides Scream Tail with recovery that makes it less susceptible to being exploited by Wish, granting Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Heatran free switches. The given EVs maximize Scream Tail's bulk while allowing it to outspeed Enamorus and shut down Calm Mind variants with Encore. An alternative spread of 120 HP / 236 SpD / 152 Spe can be used to outspeed Hydreigon while receiving a Special Defense boost in Mega Charizard Y's sun, further amplifying Scream Tail's bulk and allowing it to check Charizard under sun. Tera Steel grants a resistance to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks from Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant in a pinch, while Tera Fairy ensures Scream Tail resists Pursuit from Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and increases the power of Dazzling Gleam to potentially 2HKO and OHKO Garchomp and Iron Valiant, respectively. Scream Tail fits best on defensively oriented teams that appreciate its unique defensive attributes while being able to support it sufficiently in return. Pokemon with unreliable recovery such as Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Assault Vest Toxapex appreciate Scream Tail's high-HP Wishes, while in return they check Pokemon Scream Tail struggles with such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Due to its reliance on Protect and Leftovers for passive recovery, entry hazard control from teammates such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Tornadus-T can help mitigate its recovery. Scream Tail's passive nature means it can be exploited by Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, so Pokemon that aid against them while providing a more dangerous presence such as Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Swords Dance Gliscor pair well with it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Baxcalibur serves as a potent Dragon Dance sweeper with powerful STAB moves, threatening to OHKO the majority of the metagame at +1. Icicle Crash with Heavy-Duty Boots to flinch through potential checks such as Skarmory and Corviknight is a good alternative. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo, while also hitting defensive staples such as Skeledirge, Garganacl, and Toxapex. Thermal Exchange lets Baxcalibur avoid Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Skeledirge, and it dissuades the use of moves such as Volcarona's Flamethrower and Heatran's Magma Storm, as well as coverage from Choice-locked Pokemon like Dragapult. Tera Steel lets Baxcalibur avoid Toxic while also denying Choice Scarf Tapu Lele from revenge killing it and allowing setup in front of Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Dragon powers up Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush to lethal levels, while Earthquake boosted by Tera Ground lets Baxcalibur OHKO the aforementioned Kingambit, Garganacl, and more often that not Toxapex at +1, avoiding Iron Head, Salt Cure, and Haze, respectively. Baxcalibur functions well on offensive teams that provide dual screens support, letting it set up freely in front of Pokemon like Rotom-W and Slowbro. Baxcalibur's ability to rip holes in Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex-reliant cores greatly benefits teammates like Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Urshifu-R, which can quickly snowball late-game. Baxcalibur also appreciates Steel-types like the aforementioned Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Gholdengo, as they check Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Gholdengo in particular checks Iron Valiant, which revenge kills Baxcalibur with Quark Drive. Landorus-T pivots out on Pokemon such as Rotom-W, giving Baxcalibur an opportunity to setup while also checking threatening Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Baxcalibur appreciates entry hazard removal for Loaded Dice sets to maximize its solid natural bulk, so teammates such as Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W are appreciated. Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn are particularly annoying for Baxcalibur, so teammates such as Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Tapu Lele who assist in chipping them down are appreciated.</p> "

Its natural bulk alongside Thermal Exchange grants it plenty of wallbreaking opportunities, with the latter letting it ignore Rotom-W’s and the aforementioned walls' crippling Will-O-Wisp and Scald burns. Ice Shard allows it to revenge kill faster threats like Dragapult, Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Earthquake deals with Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, and it's Baxcalibur's hardest-hitting attack against Skeledirge, Garganacl, and Mega Tyranitar. Tera Ice and Tera Dragon boost its offensive presence; the former allows Icicle Crash to 2HKO Ferrothorn and provides significant odds for Ice Shard to OHKO Tornadus-T, as well as Dragonite through Multiscale, while the latter does so similarly with Glaive Rush, possibly OHKOing Rotom-W and 2HKOing Buzzwole. A defensive alternative is viable, as Tera Steel lets Baxcalibur stomach Dragapult's Draco Meteor, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Gholdengo's Make it Rain, shed its Stealth Rock weakness, and switch into Toxapex's Toxic. Pivots like Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Landorus-T can bring Baxcalibur in safely on Pokemon like Rotom-W, Tangrowth, Clodsire, and opposing Landorus-T, respectively. Setup sweepers or late-game cleaners such as Volcarona and Iron Valiant appreciate Baxcalibur handling Toxapex, Heatran, and Clodsire, while the likes of Dragonite and Choice Scarf Kartana enjoy Baxcalibur overwhelming physical walls like Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Skeledirge.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Ting-Lu is an outstanding wall, utilizing its immense bulk, Vessel of Ruin, and useful defensive typing to check threats such as Dragapult, Espathra, and Tapu Koko well. With access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, Ting-Lu is a flexible entry hazard setter that supports its teammates well. Ruination allows Ting-Lu to pressure Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T, which don't care about its Earthquake. Rest is an option for more longevity across the length of a game, but it renders Ting-Lu useless for a few turns. Whirlwind works exceptionally well with other hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Mega Diancie, as it lets Ting-Lu wear down Pokemon quickly for its teammates, as well as phazing setup sweepers such as Espathra and Dragonite easily. Tera Poison grants Ting-Lu a Toxic immunity while also preventing Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant from taking advatange of it. Tera Water gives Ting-Lu a solid typing defensively, letting it switch into Barraskewda and Weavile easily. Ghost is also a solid Tera type, as it lets Ting-Lu check Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, as well as blocking Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk. Water-types such as Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Floatzel easily force Ting-Lu out, making Water-resistant teammates such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Dragonite great partners. Due to Ting-Lu's susceptibility to Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta, Pokemon like Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge work really well alongside it. Gholdengo in particular forms a potent defensive core with Ting-Lu, preventing its entry hazards from being Defogged. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant all pair amazingly with Ting-Lu's hazard support. Lastly, due to Ting-Lu's susceptibility to hazard chip damage, entry hazard removers like Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk are invaluable partners.</p> "

Focus Blast is preferred for its power, allowing Iron Valiant to break through neutral targets and prevent the opponent from playing around its coverage, though Aura Sphere can be used instead for its higher consistency, albeit missing the OHKO on Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Thunderbolt catch switch-ins to Iron Valiant's STAB moves such as Moltres and Toxapex. Psyshock allows Iron Valiant to hit Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Clodsire, and Iron Moth, as well as also hitting and Toxapex. Vacuum Wave is also another option that allows Iron Valiant to act as a solid revenge killer against Pokemon like Dragon Dance Baxcalibur and Choice Scarf Kartana, though giving up an important coverage move may not be so favorable. Tapu Koko is a top teammate and facilitator for Iron Valiant, giving it a speed boost that can make Iron Valiant very difficult to play around while also being able to both pivot into it and beat its checks such as Moltres, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Teammates that can force switches and safely get Iron Valiant onto the field such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Moltres work well as teammates. Pokemon that can safely check the Poison-types that Iron Valiant struggles with such as Gliscor, Heatran, and Great Tusk also work well as teammates. Late-game cleaners that appreciate Iron Valiant's ability to tear holes in opposing defensive cores such as Mega Scizor, Baxcalibur, and Kartana also make for good teammates.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant has the stats to be a good mixed attacker. The given EV spread allows it to OHKO Blissey with Close Combat. Psyshock helps deal with Clodsire, and Thunderbolt hits Corviknight and Toxapex. Knock Off is a good option, as it helps beat Gholdengo while usefully removing items from the likes of Skeledirge, Volcarona, and Corviknight. Fairy is the best Tera type for this set, as it lets Moonblast's damage skyrocket. Steel can make up for Iron Valiant's atrocious bulk, which is even worsened by the Naive nature, and Electric also brings some defensive use while giving Thunderbolt STAB. Both also help Iron Valiant against Tornadus-T and Mega Scizor, as it can resist Hurricane and Bullet Punch. Iron Valiant appreciates slow pivots like Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Corviknight bringing it in safely. Entry hazard control is required to ensure Iron Valiant's survivability. Therefore, Defoggers like Corviknight and Tornadus-T, Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk, and even Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie are good partners.</p> "

It already possesses a high base Speed, meaning it outpaces every relevant Choice Scarf user besides itself. Calm Mind helps it pressure supposed checks such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor, although you'll need to Terastallize Iron Valiant to beat the latter. Thunderbolt helps it hit these threats, while Psyshock allows Iron Valiant to properly beat Clodsire and the aforementioned Toxapex. Thunderbolt in combination with an Electrium Z can dent checks like Toxapex and Gholdengo once boosted. Steel is the best Tera type, as it lets Iron Valiant block poison and resist strong priority moves, such as Fake Out from Mega Lopunny and Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor. Electric is also a very strong option, as it still helps against Bullet Punch and allows Iron Valiant to bash through Skeledirge and the aforementioned Mega Scizor. Since Booster Energy only activates once, this set requires a lot of support before coming in and setting up. Therefore, it's limited to very offensive playstyles. Entry hazards from Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T are needed to weaken Iron Valiant's checks such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Mega Scizor, helping it punch through them. Pokemon that share checks with Iron Valiant are also valuable teammates, like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Weavile, and Volcarona, as together they can overwhelm common checks like Corviknight and Toxapex. Iron Valiant also appreciates dual screens from Grimmsnarl or Tapu Koko. The latter brings Electric Terrain, which can be useful for Quark Drive and Thunderbolt in extended endgame scenarios. Finally, Swords Dance Kingambit and Swords Dance Garchomp can deal with its checks like Toxapex and Clodsire.</p> "

        "description": "<p>A complementary typing and a great Attack stat, especially when considering the 1.2x boost from its Wellspring Mask, give Ogerpon-W a niche as a powerful wallbreaker. Water- and Grass-type attacks hit most Pokemon for at least neutral damage, and after a Swords Dance boost, anything that doesn't resist its STAB combination is KOed. Even checks such as Baxcalibur and Tera Grass Heatran struggle to take a Swords Dance-bolstered Ivy Cudgel, and some of the stoutest walls, such as Toxapex, take heavy damage from a boosted Power Whip. Ivy Cudgel is its strongest Water-type STAB option and hits most Pokemon for neutral damage. Power Whip punishes common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Alomomola and is preferred to Wood Hammer despite the potential inaccuracy to avoid recoil. Horn Leech can also be used in order to supplement Ogerpon-W's longevity and let it come in more often. Trailblaze is another niche option, usually seen on Aurora Veil or dual screens hyper offense teams, boosting Ogerpon-W's Speed and allowing it to sweep. Play Rough notably hits Dragon-types that otherwise could resist Ogerpon-W's STAB combination such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Superpower is another great option, notably KOing Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance boost. Due to its great wallbreaking capability, setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Booster Energy Iron Valiant appreciate defensive cores being heavily weakened, allowing them to sweep. Water Absorb is a particularly useful ability prior to Terastallizing, as Ogerpon-W can find opportunities to set up on Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Manaphy, as well as block Alomomola's Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W also appreciates entry hazards from Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T, as the chip helps it pressure defensive cores even further. Despite all this, bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Kartana can check Ogerpon-W, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Medicham, and Zapdos are beneficial as teammates. Ogerpon-W is also threatened by faster attackers like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny, so defensive pivots such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Mega Scizor are also extremely useful. Despite being locked to Tera Water, this is actually very beneficial to Ogerpon-W, taking away its weaknesses to Flying- and Poison-type attacks and letting it stay in on threats such as Tornadus-T and Sneasler. In addition, Tera Water boosts its Ivy Cudgel to stupendous amounts, 2HKOing Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock and minimal chip at +2. The 1.5x Special Defense boost granted upon Terastallizing can also help mitigate attempts to revenge kill Ogerpon-W by foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> "
