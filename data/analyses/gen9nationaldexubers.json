Its presence discourages setup from foes such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, and Primal Groudon. Its ability to generate endless PP also helps against stall teams.</li> <li>In the rare case there is a Ditto mirror, the EVs, IVs, and nature maximize the chance that the opposing Ditto’s Imposter ability activates first, thus causing it to run out of PP first.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Ditto to block Extreme Speed from Arceus, since it cannot OHKO Arceus with Extreme Speed or Tera Ghost Arceus with Shadow Claw at +2 from full, while Arceus can at the expense of Tera Normal thanks to Ditto’s low HP stat.</li> <li>Tera Fairy provides a resistance to Sucker Punch and Foul Play, making it harder for Yveltal and Arceus-Dark to revenge kill Ditto. Tera Fairy also provides a useful immunity to Dragon-type moves, letting Ditto soft check Eternatus and Palkia-O.</li> <li>Tera Dark also resists Sucker Punch and Foul Play while also providing a resistance to Marshadow’s Shadow Sneak. Thanks to Tera Dark’s immunity to Psychic, it allows Ditto to absorb powerful attacks such as +1 Light that Burns the Sky from Ultra Necrozma and Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice allows Ditto to hit Zygarde and Mega Salamence with a super effective move in the rare case Ditto copies a Marshadow with Hidden Power.</li> <li>Ditto should be swapped in carefully, as any unnecessary damage can compromise its role. Due to its low HP stat, Ditto struggles defensively even when transforming into walls such as Chansey.</li> <li>Ditto greatly helps in the hyper offense matchup by restricting the opponent from setting up in addition to Imposter taking away Sticky Web's Speed drop, keeping teammates such as Eternatus, Ho-Oh and Yveltal from being overwhelmed by boosting threats such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Ditto can be used to greatly help in the stall matchup thanks to its ability to generate endless PP. Ditto stays healthy by copying recovery moves from Chansey, Dondozo, and Arceus-Dark. Ditto also increases its longevity by copying abilities such as Natural Cure from Chansey and Regenerator from Ho-Oh, and Alomomola.</li> <li>Ditto is a good fit on balance teams, as it helps Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal from being overwhelmed by hyper offense threats such as Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma. In return, Ho-Oh and Yveltal keep entry hazards off the field, since Ditto can easily get worn down by them.</li> <li>Teammates such as Primal Groudon and Zygarde are free to use more offensive sets thanks to Ditto being able to check threats such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and opposing Primal Groudon for them. In addition, Zygarde appreciates Ditto allowing it to run a specially defensive set for Arceus-Water instead.</li> <li>Due to being locked into one move, Ditto can be countered by a surprise Tera from threats such as Tera Fairy Eternatus and Tera Ghost Arceus, so another form of reliable revenge killing such as Arceus and Choice Band Marshadow is appreciated.</li> </ul>"

After a boost, it also OHKOes Calyrex-I and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Mega Mewtwo Y to hit Yveltal while also dissuading Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Zygarde, and Rayquaza from switching into an unscouted Mega Mewtwo Y. Focus Blast allows Mega Mewtwo Y to threaten Arceus-Dark. However, no matter which coverage move is chosen, Mega Mewtwo Y will have a problem with either Arceus-Dark or Yveltal that must be accounted for with teammates.</li> <li>Base Mewtwo's Unnerve may prove very situationally useful to prevent berries from being used against Mewtwo such as in the case of Chople Berry Arceus when running Focus Blast or in forcing initial poison damage on Lum Berry users from Toxic Spikes. However, Mega Mewtwo Y is required to Mega Evolve to outspeed threats like offensive Eternatus.</li> <li>88 Defense EVs allow Mega Mewtwo Y to survive Life Orb Marshadow's Shadow Sneak, while 216 Speed EVs lets Mega Mewtwo Y outspeed Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao while also ensuring that base Mewtwo outspeeds Marshadow. It’s not always required to immediately Mega Evolve, as Mega Mewtwo Y's reduced Defense may allow Choice Band Marshadow’s Shadow Sneak and Arceus-Dark's Foul Play to OHKO it.</li> <li>Mega Mewtwo Y should be used as a wallbreaker in the early- and mid-game; removing Pokemon such as defensive Necrozma-DM and defensive Arceus-Ground can help its teammates sweep late-game. Mega Mewtwo Y has the potential to sweep, but it doesn't do so consistently, as it runs into many roadblocks, such as priority from Marshadow and Yveltal.</li> <li>Other offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Meteor Beam Eternatus appreciate Mega Mewtwo Y breaking down checks such as Primal Groudon and defensive Necrozma-DM for them to potentially sweep.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy and defensive Eternatus are amazing partners, as they can switch into Mega Mewtwo Y’s biggest checks in Marshadow, Arceus-Dark, and Yveltal.

However, thanks to its decent bulk, great ability in Sturdy, and ways to maintain momentum in Final Gambit and Encore, it is an excellent suicide lead for hyper offense teams.</li> <li>Final Gambit allows Shuckle to safely bring in an ally such as Zacian-C or Arceus-Ground after entry hazards are set.</li> <li>Encore prevents Shuckle from being easily set up on by threats such as Arceus-Ground, Zacian-C, and Mega Salamence while additionally providing switch-in opportunities for teammates.</li> <li>Tera Steel blocks Mortal Spin attempts from Glimmora and Smeargle. However, Terastallizing Shuckle should not be done in most cases unless the opponent has no other form of entry hazard removal. This means Tera Steel is only useful against opposing hyper offense teams with these Mortal Spin leads, as balance and stall teams usually have other hazard removal means like Giratina-O and Ho-Oh that Shuckle cannot block.</li> <li>Shuckle should prioritize getting Sticky Web up against opposing hyper offense, offense, and balance teams. Against slower teams such as stall and Trick Room teams, Stealth Rock is more useful. Though, setting entry hazards up against Trick Room teams is harder due to Hatterene. The best play is to lead with Necrozma-DM instead, as it can burn Hatterene's Trick Room turns thanks to its resistance to Calyrex-I's and Melmetal's STAB moves. Shuckle should instead attempt to set Stealth Rock up against Calyrex-I, burning a turn of Trick Room in the process.</li> <li>If Shuckle survives the first few turns by letting a teammate in with Encore, it can continue to provide value by being sacrificed to safely switch in a teammate or to burn a turn of Trick Room from Hatterene or Psychic Terrain from Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Pokemon that appreciate Sticky Web support from Shuckle like Swords Dance Arceus formes, Primal Kyogre, Primal Groudon, and Eternatus make excellent teammates.</li> <li>Shuckle cannot keep entry hazards up against common Defoggers such as Giratina-O, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh due to its passivity, so teammates that can threaten these Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Meteor Beam Eternatus are appreciated.</li> </ul>"

Its Fire / Flying typing and solid mixed bulk enable it to come into a variety of foes such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Mega Salamence. Its typing specifically grants it an immunity to burns from the likes of Giratina-O and Arceus-Dark and Toxic Spikes from Eternatus.</li> <li>Sacred Fire acts as a solid STAB option that also lets Ho-Oh apply pressure on Steel-types—which are immune to Toxic—like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C while also potentially crippling foes with a burn, rendering it difficult to switch into.</li> <li>Toxic allows Ho-Oh to cripple switch-ins such as Zygarde, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, opposing Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes without Refresh.</li> <li>Whirlwind provides a phazing option to disrupt setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde.</li> <li>The physical bulk avoids an OHKO from Zacian-C's Wild Charge at +2 Attack and Choice Band Tera Flying Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent while also letting it never be 2HKOed by a +1 Eternatus Dynamax Cannon.</li> <li>Tera Grass helps against foes such as Marshadow, Arceus-Ground, and especially Zygarde, as Zygarde's Thousand Arrows hits the entire metagame for neutral or super effective damage otherwise. Tera Grass also makes it a good check for Water-types such as Palkia-O, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Tera Ground gives Ho-Oh the option to outplay foes that try to hit it with super effective Rock- and Electric-type coverage like Marshadow and Flutter Mane and also eases the matchup against Eternatus and Zekrom.</li> <li>Tera Dark provides Ho-Oh with the capability to easily check Psychic-, Dark-, and Ghost-types like Mega Mewtwo Y, Ultra Necrozma, Yveltal, and Lunala. With it, Ho-Oh can also ignore Taunt from Grimmsnarl, allowing it to remove dual screens with Defog.</li> <li>By Terastallizing, Ho-Oh minds Stealth Rock significantly less, which can be crucial if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, with Tera Ground in particular giving the most longevity via resisting the Rock-type. However, it also becomes vulnerable to other entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Ho-Oh's utility and defensive traits let it fit well on balance and more defensive team structures that appreciate a hazard control option, pivot, and phazer.</li> <li>Avoid keeping Ho-Oh on targets that can use Knock Off to remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Otherwise, Ho-Oh will be forced to either compromise its longevity and utility or Terastallize.</li> <li>Ho-Oh should be preserved at good health if the other team has strong threats that it's meant to check, such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde. When handling setup sweepers, it's more consistently reliable for Ho-Oh to use Whirlwind than to inflict a burn with Sacred Fire. However, this strategy shouldn't be relied on too much late-game, as Whirlwind fails when only a single foe remains.</li> <li>As it's tasked with answering many different threats, Ho-Oh can get overwhelmed if heavily relied on. Therefore, Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Poison, and Necrozma-DM help Ho-Oh as secondary answers to foes such as Zacian-C.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Marshadow, Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Primal Groudon often run super effective coverage that can KO Ho-Oh; as such, it appreciates allies that can come into them, which include Giratina-O, Arceus-Ground, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ho-Oh appreciates hazard setters because Sacred Fire, Toxic, and Whirlwind can force a lot of switches and thus deal massive amounts of chip damage, so Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Eternatus are great allies in this regard.</li> </ul>"

The recoil can be quite detrimental to Ho-Oh when it's staying in for longer periods of time, however.</li> <li>Earthquake is a coverage option that allows Ho-Oh to hit Eternatus for far more damage than just its STAB moves would facilitate, 2HKOing defensive variants that outspeed Arceus while also being able to nail Primal Groudon much harder than any of its other moves. Defog may be considered if the team is still in need of a Defogger; it does, however, give up a powerful means of pressuring the opponent and makes Ho-Oh much more reliant on teammates to break through Eternatus.</li> <li>The fourth moveslot is flexible and it depends on the team's needs. Toxic invalidates many checks such as support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Zygarde.</li> <li>Thunder Wave is also a valid choice to allow Ho-Oh to more immediately slow down targets such as Eternatus, Mega Salamence, Arceus formes, and Palkia-O.</li> <li>The given primary EVs allow Ho-Oh avoid the 2HKO from a +1 Dynamax Cannon from Eternatus and outspeed paralyzed Zacian-C, while the rest of the EVs are allocated to Attack to allow Ho-Oh to hit as hard as possible. The alternate EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Silk Scarf Arceus's Extreme Speed, a OHKO from +1 Zacian-C's Wild Charge, outspeeds Adamant Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow after a Flame Charge boost, with the rest invested on Attack to maximize damage output.</li> <li>Tera Ground is the primary option to allow Ho-Oh to OHKO Meteor Beam Eternatus and make Earthquake far more threatening for Primal Groudon. Tera Ground also comes with the added benefit of removing Ho-Oh's weakness to Stealth Rock, thus making Ho-Oh far less afraid of losing its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off, which is especially notable when Defog is chosen.</li> <li>Tera Fire is also an option to boost Flare Blitz damage, and it is the preferred option with the move, closing important gaps such as 2HKOing maximum HP support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock and outright OHKOing offensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Don't be afraid to switch Ho-Oh into targets that it's typically able to check like specially offensive Giratina-O and Arceus-Fairy to force them out and start making progress.</li> <li>Ho-Oh gains significant advantages from entry hazard stacking. In fact, although its damage output remains formidable, Brave Bird often fails to achieve certain benchmarks, such as securing a 2HKO against defensive Primal Kyogre or support Arceus formes, without additional support. This means it often finds itself on bulky offense teams that can consistently get up entry hazards and maintain them throughout the game.</li> <li>Offensive Stealth Rock or Spikes variant of Primal Groudon makes for a great teammate, being able to set up entry hazards for both itself and Ho-Oh, appreciating the many status conditions Ho-Oh is capable of spreading to ease setup with Swords Dance. Primal Kyogre also has great synergy with Ho-Oh offensively, greatly appreciating the heavy damage Ho-Oh gets on targets like defensive Eternatus and Primal Groudon so Primal Kyogre can blow massive holes into the opposing team and vice versa.</li> <li>Zacian-C is a deadly partner, capable of sweeping entire teams with the prior damage Ho-Oh can inflict on many of its main checks such as Primal Groudon and Coil Zygarde while being able to put immense pressure on most variants of defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul>"

Return serves as a weaker but safer STAB move, although it misses out on the 2HKO on foes like Ho-Oh and offensive Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Earthquake is Mega Salamence's best coverage move to hit Steel-types like Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM and to hit Primal Groudon almost as hard as Double-Edge without the recoil damage. At +1, it can OHKO Zacian-C and additionally OHKO Zekrom after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Roost provides Mega Salamence with reliable recovery and helps it find more setup opportunities throughout the battle, while Facade punishes foes that try to status it like Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dark at the cost of making Mega Salamence more sensitive to chip damage while setting up.</li> <li>Mega Salamence, especially when not running Roost, should aim to switch in after a foe has fainted or on a predicted Earthquake from foes like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus. By pressuring these Pokemon to switch out, it can take on the opportunity to set up and start wearing down its checks.</li> <li>In certain scenarios, retaining access to Salamence's Intimidate can prove advantageous due to its capability to mitigate foes that threaten to set up such as Rayquaza and Necrozma-DM. Additionally, the Attack drop can let Mega Salamence avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Poltergeist, offensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, and Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and set up on them.</li> <li>Having weaknesses to Fairy and Ice, Mega Salamence appreciates Fire- and Steel-type teammates such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C that can threaten the likes of opposing Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Fairy-type teammates like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy love Mega Salamence's ability to check Steel- and Fire-types such as Magearna and Primal Groudon and threaten them with Earthquake.</li> <li>Mega Salamence works well on hyper offense teams, and suicide entry hazard leads such as Deoxys-S and Glimmora are invaluable in helping it sweep; the aforementioned Pokemon can also prevent hazards.

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Defensive Primal Kyogre is an oppressive force against bulkier teams, as it is able to shrug off weak attacks and passive damage that significantly hinder wallbreaker sets. Additionally, its base 180 Special Attack in conjunction with Scald and Ice Beam enables Primal Kyogre to trade with many offensive threats such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence, even without offensive investment. These traits make Primal Kyogre an essential component of the defensive backbone on many balance teams.</li> <li>Aside from powering up Primal Kyogre's attacks, Calm Mind enables Primal Kyogre to turn the tables on some switch-ins that typically check wallbreaker sets, such as Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Ditto, by turning them into setup fodder. It can also be used to gain a free boost on Primal Groudon that switches in to sacrifice itself to entry hazards and reset the weather.</li> <li>Sleep Talk can be used instead of Calm Mind to alleviate some of Primal Kyogre's issues against offensive teams where it would otherwise be unable to use Rest. However, this does come at the cost of diminished utility against defensive teams, as Primal Kyogre is reliant on Calm Mind to break through Pokemon such as Giratina and Chansey.</li> <li>Scald is Primal Kyogre's STAB move of choice due to its higher PP, accuracy, and ability to hinder physical attackers such as Arceus and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Ice Beam provides Primal Kyogre the ability to hit Primal Groudon, which is its primary switch-in on most teams. While it only 4HKOes Primal Groudon, it will be quickly worn down due to its vulnerability to all entry hazards and its lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, Ice Beam prevents Primal Kyogre from being set up on by the many threatening Dragon-types of the tier, such as Ultra Necrozma, Eternatus, and Mega Salamence. Ice Beam also plays a role in enabling Primal Kyogre to function as a wincon against stall teams, as it would otherwise run out of Scald PP.</li> <li>Rest is primarily used against bulkier balance and stall teams to help accumulate Calm Mind boosts, as most of the Pokemon found on these teams cannot meaningfully damage it. Rest generally should not used against more offensive teams, as the two free turns are highly exploitable and will likely be leveraged by Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Xerneas, and Arceus to boost into a range where they are able to sweep. As such, Primal Kyogre is better off attempting to trade with or weaken a Pokemon on more offensive teams.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Primal Kyogre to survive some very powerful attacks that one would assume would knock it out. For example, Primal Kyogre is 2HKOed by +1 Mega Salamence's Double Edge and +1 Zacian-C's Wild Charge and 3HKOed by uninvested Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades. Additionally, unboosted Primal Kyogre is 3HKOed by Xerneas's Moonblast before Geomancy and Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse with this EV spread.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Kyogre generally should not be used early-game, though it can be used as a lead against hyper offense teams, as Scald provides the chance to OHKO dedicated leads such as Shuckle, Smeargle, and Glimmora due to its burn chance, preventing them from setting multiple entry hazards. Primal Kyogre generally struggles against more offensive structures due to its limited hit-taking capabilities and often trades against a singular Pokemon at best. Defensive Primal Kyogre usually finds its first entry point mid-game, and it can use Ice Beam to heavily chip Primal Groudon that switches in for the benefit of teammates such as Xerneas and Zacian-C. Against balance teams, Primal Kyogre plays a critical role in dismantling or weakening the defensive backbone of the opposing team to allow more offensively inclined teammates such as Power Herb Eternatus and Arceus-Ground to sweep.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre has the tendency to be overwhelmed by powerful attackers, especially Swords Dance Primal Groudon, which capitalizes on the free turn where Primal Kyogre is forced out. Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dark can check powerful physical attackers while also appreciating Primal Kyogre's ability to deal with Ho-Oh especially since Zygarde specifically can be frustrated by Ho-Oh's phazing. Additionally, due to Primal Kyogre's middling matchup into offensive structures, Marshadow and Ditto make good teammates due to their ability to revenge kill many of the most threatening Pokemon found on these structures, such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre also appreciates both entry hazard support and removal, as both Primal Kyogre and Pokemon that threaten it are pushed into KO range with the presence of entry hazards. Consequently, Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Groudon with Overheat are excellent teammates. Ho-Oh is the best Defogger and defensive pivot in the tier and also phazes many Pokemon that may view Primal Kyogre as a setup opportunity, such as Xerneas and Zacian-C. Primal Groudon provides entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock or Spikes.</li> <li>Although Primal Kyogre will not sweep stall teams by itself, it requires little support to achieve a gamestate where it is able to do so. As in other matchups, Primal Kyogre generally does not have an early-game presence, as it relies on teammates such as Overheat Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh to set and remove entry hazards. Overheat Primal Groudon eases the burden on Primal Kyogre against stall teams, as it 2HKOes Dondozo, a staple on stall teams, after Stealth Rock. Additionally, Primal Kyogre requires some help against Confide Chansey. Consequently, Eternatus is an excellent teammate, as Pressure in conjunction with bulk allows it to absorb Confide and Seismic Toss, which allows Primal Kyogre to make progress.</li> </ul>"

If entry hazards are up, it can also be used to rack up damage against the opposing team.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Primal Groudon avoid being OHKOed by Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost, with the rest being used to augment Primal Groudon's physical bulk, notably allowing it to survive +2 Tera Ground Zacian-C's Tera Blast. An Impish nature is prefered if Primal Groudon is running Rock Tomb, while Relaxed is preferred if Primal Groudon is running Overheat.</li> <li>This set fits best on bulky offensive teams that need a solid entry hazard setter that is not passive against common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal.</li> <li>Tera Grass Ho-Oh can help Primal Groudon to deal with Primal Kyogre, which can be somewhat tricky for Primal Groudon to handle alone. Most of the time, trading HP against the opposing Primal Groudon is not wanted, so solid answers to it like Zygarde and Giratina-O are welcome additions. Good answers to Arceus-Ground are also recommended, such as defensive Primal Kyogre and the aforementioned Ho-Oh.</li> </ul>"

It also lets Primal Groudon avoid an OHKO from +3 Zacian-C's Tera Fighting Close Combat after Stealth Rock and a 2HKO from wallbreaker Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. The alternate spread is intended for variants without Stone Edge; it lets Primal Groudon avoid an OHKO from Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost and maximizes its physical bulk, notably letting it avoid an OHKO from +2 Zacian-C's Tera Blast Ground.</li> <li>Primal Groudon generally forces switches out of the innate difficulty of scouting its set early-game. Because of this, it's often ideal to lead with Primal Groudon and set entry hazards, especially as its high mixed bulk makes it difficult to immediately KO. However, its defensive utility can prove crucial to check a wide variety of foes in the metagame such as Primal Kyogre, Marshadow, and Zacian-C, so it should be preserved mid-game if the opposing team has foes Primal Groudon's team could struggle with otherwise.</li> <li>Primal Groudon has a poor matchup against a common Defogger in Giratina-O, so wallbreakers that threaten it such as Marshadow, Meteor Beam Eternatus, and Zacian-C make for good allies. Defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Arceus formes with Refresh also act as reliable switch-ins for this purpose.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes with Taunt can shut down Primal Groudon from setting hazards or applying offensive pressure with Swords Dance; Arceus-Ground and Zygarde in particular can directly threaten Primal Groudon without setting up with their Ground-type STAB moves.

  "Rayquaza": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Band Rayquaza is a terror capable of 2HKOing the entire tier. Coupled with its base 95 Speed, which outpaces most of the defensive metagame, and U-turn for momentum, it is a valued wallbreaker on many balance and bulky offense teams. Even in less favorable matchups, such as against hyper offense, Rayquaza can still frequently trade with Pokemon such as Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Rayquaza's power lies in Dragon Ascent, which can 2HKO most pokemon. Even Dondozo, an excellent physical wall, is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Defensive Necrozma-DM, the only somewhat common switch-in to Dragon Ascent, is OHKOed by V-create after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake is an alternative to V-create that still 2HKOes defensive Necrozma-DM while avoiding the Speed drop. U-turn provides a very scarce source of momentum while taking advantage of the many Pokemon Rayquaza scares out such as Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Extreme Speed allows Rayquaza to revenge kill some boosted Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground and Ultra Necrozma after some chip damage, though it should be used cautiously because it leaves Rayquaza extremely vulnerable to being used as setup fodder.</li> <li>24 HP and 12 Defense EVs enable Rayquaza to survive Mega Salamence's Double Edge and switch in with Stealth Rock present 4 times, with 4 Special Defense EVs avoiding a OHKO from offensive Calm Mind Arceus-Ground's Ice Beam after Rayquaza has Terastallized. This conveniently costs Rayquaza little, as it still is able to outpace most of the defensive metagame such as Primal Groudon without reducing its offensive firepower.</li> <li>Tera Flying boosts Dragon Ascent to an absurd level of power that mandates checking Rayquaza offensively, as defensive Necrozma-DM is the only common switch-in. This forces aggressive play to limit Rayquaza, as Tera Flying Dragon Ascent OHKOes some Pokemon that would otherwise trade with Rayquaza such as offensive and defensive Primal Kyogre. Tera Flying also provides some practical defensive benefits due to it removing weaknesses while maintaining Rayquaza's immunity to Sticky Web, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. For example, after Terastallization, Rayquaza survives offensive Calm Mind Arceus-Ground's +1 Ice Beam and Meteor Beam Eternatus's +1 Dynamax Cannon. Both of these Pokemon offensively can deal heavy damage to Rayquaza, but in turn are OHKOed by Rayquaza due to the power boost from Tera Flying.</li> <li>Rayquaza is best used early- and mid-game to break the defensive backbone of balance and stall teams. Rayquaza is a solid lead due to its positive matchups against common balance leads such as defensive Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark, as the chip damage from U-turn renders them unable to switch into Rayquaza later in the game as it brings in a teammate that can scare them out. Defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and utility Arceus formes cannot tank a Dragon Ascent while remaining healthy enough to check Rayquaza's teammates. This results in a win-win situation where Rayquaza can either continue pivoting or wallbreak mid-game.</li> <li>Rayquaza's efficacy as a wallbreaker truly shines against stall teams, as the sole Flying-resistant foe on them is the rare Mega Tyranitar, meaning Rayquaza only has to worry about managing Dragon Ascent PP because it 2HKOes Dondozo and Arceus-Dark, which are the answers to physically offensive threats for most stall teams. However, Rayquaza struggles against more offensive teams, as its middling Speed tier makes it easily revenge killed or set up on by Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Ultra Necrozma. This often limits Rayquaza to trading KOs against offensive teams, though it can be used as a revenge killer if needed.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is an excellent teammate for Rayquaza due to checking common switch-ins such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, and it can be brought in safely against these threats via U-turn. Marshadow is also a good teammate because it revenge kills hyper offense such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C, alleviating the need for Rayquaza to revenge kill boosted threats so it can focus on wallbreaking or trading.</li> <li>Rayquaza also appreciates Defog support from Giratina-O or Ho-Oh due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Though Rayquaza does not enjoy the presence of Stealth Rock, it is not immediately hamstrung by it and can still effectively wallbreak against balance and bulky offense teams. Since Rayquaza outspeeds all of its targets except Timid utility Arceus formes, removing them to enable teammates is often worth the cost of some HP in situations where Stealth Rock cannot be removed immediately. However, Stealth Rock heavily hinders Rayquaza's potency as a pivot in longer games against bulkier balance and stall teamms, so removal should be prioritized in these matchups.</li> </ul>"

      "Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Sporting a sky-high Attack stat, a powerful Flying-type STAB move in the form of Dragon Ascent, and amazing coverage alongside a decent Speed tier, Rayquaza is a powerful sweeper that is able fit on many offensive teams as either a threatening sweeper with Dragon Dance or a terrifying wallbreaker with Swords Dance on teams with Sticky Web support.</li> <li>Extreme Speed gives Rayquaza powerful priority that allows it to thwart revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A, OHKOing the former after a Swords Dance while OHKOing the latter unboosted, as well as letting Rayquaza pick off weakened boosted foes such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>V-create gives Rayquaza great coverage alongside Dragon Ascent, OHKOing Zacian-C and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock, which could otherwise take on Rayquaza, at the cost of lowering Rayquaza's Speed. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over V-create for similar coverage against Steel-type Pokemon that doesn't drop Rayquaza's defenses and Speed while also letting it hit Zekrom and Primal Groudon much harder after a boost. However, the power drop is significant, as Earthquake cannot OHKO Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used over Adamant to maximize Rayquaza's Speed, which notably lets it outspeed offensive Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and utility Arceus formes, as well as Zacian-C and the rest of the metagame after a boost.</li> <li>Tera Flying jacks up the power of Dragon Ascent, letting Rayquaza 2HKO Dondozo and OHKO Pokemon such as defensive Ho-Oh and Eternatus at +1. Tera Fire gives Rayquaza an immunity to burns from Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, which can help Rayquaza set up against them, and it also gives Rayquaza STAB on V-create, which allows the move to OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM. Tera Fire also turns Rayquaza's previous Ice and Fairy weaknesses into resistances against Pokemon like Arceus-Ground carrying Ice Beam and Zacian-C, respectively. Tera Normal gives Rayquaza STAB on Extreme Speed, which allows +2 Extreme Speed to OHKO Pokemon like offensive Yveltal and Palkia-O, and it also prevents Marshadow from revenge killing Rayquaza with Shadow Sneak or stealing Swords Dance boosts with Spectral Thief.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Rayquaza best fits on hyper offense teams, while Swords Dance Rayquaza best fits on Sticky Web teams. Swords Dance Rayquaza can use Extreme Speed to prevent faster Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Salamence, and Deoxys-A from revenge killing it and to outpace other common forms of priority such as Extreme Speed from Swords Dance Arceus and Sucker Punch from Yveltal. Once its checks, such as Yveltal and Zacian-C, are eliminated, Rayquaza can function well as a mid-game wallbreaker by spamming Dragon Ascent against many neutral targets such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus along with its coverage for Steel-type Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, or it can alternatively grab setup opportunities against Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground lacking Ice Beam.</li> <li>Since Rayquaza is found on hyper offense teams, leads such as Deoxys-S, Shuckle, and Smeargle are mandatory for setting the tempo of the game, with Deoxys-S pairing well with Dragon Dance Rayquaza by setting entry hazards, allowing Rayquaza to clinch KOs on bulky Pokemon such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM, and Shuckle or Smeargle pairing beautifully with Swords Dance Rayquaza by setting Sticky Web to allow Rayquaza to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Marshadow. Dual screens setters such as Grimmsnarl can also help Rayquaza sweep by making it easier for it to set up with Dragon Dance.</li> <li>Offensive teammates that can cover Rayquaza's weaknesses such as Zacian-C and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM are helpful, as they can pressure Rayquaza's offensive checks in Mega Mewtwo Y and Arceus-Fairy. In return, Rayquaza can help by chipping down Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for Zacian-C and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM to more easily break through. Other teammates such as Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma are all great to overwhelm shared checks such as Yveltal and defensive Primal Groudon while denting huge holes in the opposition for Rayquaza to clean up.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Deoxys-A's unrivaled power, great coverage, and amazing Speed tier let it serve as an almost unwallable mid-to-late-game wallbreaker that can also double as a revenge killer.</li> <li>Psycho Boost OHKOes offensive Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Eternatus, Rayquaza, and Zygarde, while being able to OHKO Terastallized offensive Eternatus and Zygarde after slight chip damage.</li> <li>Low Kick has consistently high Base Power thanks to the high general weight of Pokemon in National Dex Ubers, and it 2HKOes Dark-type Pokemon like Arceus-Dark and offensive Yveltal without any drawbacks. Low Kick also hits Necrozma-DM for a reasonable amount of damage and does large amounts of damage into certain specially bulky Pokemon like Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Shadow Ball has virtually perfect neutral coverage with Low Kick and hits Necrozma-DM, which otherwise is not particularly threatened by Deoxys-A's moves, for a 2HKO. With Tera Ghost, Shadow Ball becomes genuinely powerful, allowing it to OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y, Ultra Necrozma, and Necrozma-DM after a layer of Spikes, and 2HKO almost everything it hits neutrally. It should be noted, however, that a super effective Shadow Ball is weaker than a neutral Psycho Boost unless Terastallization is used, which can make Deoxys-A a bit reliant on such a mechanic to act as a proper wallbreaker in these matchups.</li> <li>At the cost of making Deoxys-A reliant on Terastallization to use Ghost-type coverage, running Tera Blast over Shadow Ball makes Deoxys-A much less exploitable overall. Due to becoming physical after Psycho Boost is used and coming off of Deoxys-A's base 180 Attack, Tera Blast is barely weakened, and it can confirm a KO on a badly poisoned Ho-Oh switching into Psycho Boost—making running dedicated coverage for Ho-Oh much less necessary—while still being incredibly difficult to switch into. Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are still 2HKOed by a physical Tera Blast Ghost, and physical Tera Blast also retains the ability to OHKO Ultra Necrozma, Mega Mewtwo Y, and offensive Lunala, preventing these threats from exploiting Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Running Rock Slide allows Deoxys-A to potentially OHKO defensive Ho-Oh, dissuading it from consistently sponging attacks from Deoxys-A and allowing Deoxys-A to defeat it one-on-one. Because Rock Slide is physical, it can safely be used after Psycho Boost is used, increasing its general consistency. It also hits Yveltal harder than Low Kick, notably 2HKOing defensive variants.</li> <li>Ice Beam hits Yveltal harder than Rock Slide, OHKOing all variants after Stealth Rock, while relieving Deoxys-A of the need to use Psycho Boost to OHKO targets like Zygarde, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Extreme Speed is a third option over Rock Slide that gives Deoxys-A more play against offensive teams. Not only does it allow Deoxys-A to revenge kill weakened Speed boosters like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Salamence, but it also allows Deoxys-A to prevent Ditto from revenge killing it via Tera Ghost + Extreme Speed and gives Deoxys-A counterplay against Sucker Punch Yveltal.</li> <li>A Naive nature with 252 Speed EVs is ran to ensure that Deoxys-A outspeeds Zacian-C and Mega Mewtwo Y, allowing it to threaten them. The Speed also allows Deoxys-A Speed tie opposing Deoxys-A and outspeed slower foes at +1, such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde. 29 HP IVs reduce Life Orb recoil.</li> <li>In addition to the offensive power boost to Deoxys-A's Ghost-type coverage, Tera Ghost gives Deoxys-A an immunity to Extreme Speed, allowing it to check Arceus and Rayquaza. In certain cases, however, Tera Normal may be considered to blank Marshadow while allowing Psycho Boost + Extreme Speed to often KO Ho-Oh from full health, but the immunity is otherwise useless and doing this denies Deoxys-A the option of having powerful Ghost-type coverage, making it easier to handle overall.</li> <li>Because Deoxys-A is absurdly frail, it should never be brought into an attack, lest it get OHKOed. Instead, it should be brought in via the use of double switches, after a Pokemon is KOed, or via a slow pivot. It should also only be attacking if it can OHKO the target or if a switch is predicted.</li> <li>Deoxys-A can be extremely reliant on entry hazards and general chip damage to secure many notable OHKOs, so hazard setters like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Eternatus are good partners. * Deoxys-A is easily revenge killed by Marshadow and checked by Dark-types like Yveltal—particularly Sucker Punch variants—and Arceus-Dark, so Pokemon that handle them well like Arceus-Fairy and support variants of Yveltal are useful teammates. The former can also be handy against Arceus-Dark and Yveltal, which can otherwise be a great hinderance to Deoxys-A, while the latter is a rare source of pivoting in U-turn, which can be used to give Deoxys-A additional wallbreaking opportunities.</li> </ul>"

Counter is an alternative to OHKO foes such as Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh after luring an attack while having its Focus Sash intact, giving a means for Deoxys-A to play around such checks.</li> <li>Shadow Ball provides coverage to super effectively target anti-leads such as Necrozma-DM and Deoxys-S, avoiding passivity and giving the rest of its team an easier chance to break past them by wearing them down.</li> <li>Icy Wind allows Deoxys-A to anti-lead Deoxys-S, enabling Deoxys-A to outspeed and KO it with Shadow Ball afterwards. This move can also be used to wear down setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, rendering them easier to revenge kill by mitigating their Speed stat boosts.</li> <li>Tera Steel grants an immunity to Glimmora's Mortal Spin, giving the situational use to preserve entry hazards on the other side of the field.</li> <li>By keeping Deoxys-A for the middle stages of the game instead of leading with it, it can bluff as another set variant of itself, allowing it to set entry hazards mid-game on expected switches. This strategy is usually ideal if the foe is likely to lead with a Pokemon that Deoxys-A can't play around depending on its set, such as Yveltal for sets without Icy Wind, and Grimmsnarl for any variant outside of Taunt, but entry hazards should be kept out of its side of the field to ensure Deoxys-A can use its Focus Sash.</li> <li>As the offensive pressure of Deoxys-A relies on forcing the opponent to scout its moveset, it's best to not unecessarily reveal parts of its moveset unless the situation calls for it.</li> <li>Deoxys-A can struggle to get past Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark, and Steel-types including Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, therefore allies such as Tera Electric Zacian-C, Marshadow, and Double Dance Primal Groudon make great allies to wallbreak past them.</li> <li>Hyper offense Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Eternatus appreciate the entry hazards laid by Deoxys-A to more often threaten the opposing team with a sweep by wearing down their checks and punishing switching.</li> </ul>"

However, it is generally best to avoid Terastallizing Deoxys-S, saving the slot for one of its teammates instead.</li> <li>Deoxys-S is best used as a lead, since it provides little defensive or offensive options to its team, so it is usually worth sacrificing early-game for a second layer of dual screens or a fast Taunt to stop opposing sweepers such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Mewtwo Y from setting up. Against physical threats like Rayquaza and Marshadow, Deoxys-S should set Reflect first, while against special threats like Flutter Mane and Palkia-O, it should set Light Screen to ensure it can survive a hit and set Reflect.</li> <li>Dual screens Deoxys-S sets are perfect enablers for bulkier sweepers like Zygarde-C, Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Water, and Primal Groudon.

Palkia-O is capable of 2HKOing defensive stalwarts such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Eternatus, and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Fire Blast roasts Ferrothorn while also hitting Tera Grass Ho-Oh for slightly more damage than Spacial Rend.</li> <li>Palkia-O's last moveslot is rather flexible. Substitute takes advantage of the many switches Palkia-O forces and protects it from status moves. Alternatively, Draco Meteor enables Palkia-O to nab some OHKOs on Pokemon that Spacial Rend cannot, such as defensive Eternatus, Zygarde-C, and Eruption Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>A Modest nature is preferred to enhance Palkia-O's wallbreaking capabilities. A Timid nature is usable if outspeeding Adamant Ultra Necrozma and Speed tying Calm Mind Arceus formes is desired. However, running a Timid nature comes at the cost of never OHKOing defensive Eternatus, turning defensive Primal Groudon into a roll to 2HKO, and rarely 2HKOing Primal Kyogre with Spacial Rend.</li> <li>Tera Water is used over Tera Dragon, since Primal Groudon is 2HKOed by Spacial Rend regardless. Tera Water Hydro Pump is capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after a single layer of Spikes, and support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Palkia-O is best used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams to tear through the defensive backbone of balance teams. It struggles against hyper offense teams, as it can be outsped or set up on, limiting the damage it can do. Against these teams, Palkia-O is often limited to trading.

      "Physical Utility": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Levitate, paired with a unique typing, solid bulk, and access to various status moves, allows Giratina-O to be a reliable Defogger while also having a good offensive presence, discouraging opposing Pokemon from setting entry hazards. Giratina-O also serves as one of the most reliable switch-ins to Primal Groudon, as well as Primal Kyogre, Mega Salamence, Swords Dance Arceus formes, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Poltergeist is Giratina-O's main source of damage, allowing it to do solid damage against non-resistant targets.</li> <li>Dragon Tail can phaze foes, ensuring setup threats like Swords Dance Arceus can't boost for free, although this doesn't work against Fairy-types like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Defog allows Giratina-O to remove entry hazards for teammates such as Mega Salamence; with its solid defensive profile combined with good status moves and even decent offenses, it is difficult to stop Giratina-O from freely removing hazards, making it an effective Defogger. Alternatively, Rest lets Giratina-O stay healthy throughout a game and removes any status conditions it may have, such as burn and Toxic, if there is already a reliable Defogger on the team.</li> <li>The fourth moveslot is very flexible for Giratina-O. Will-O-Wisp and Toxic are useful status moves, both crippling opposing Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp targets physical attackers like Swords Dance Arceus formes, Zacian-C, and offensive Necrozma-DM, while Toxic limits the effectiveness of Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde by reducing their longevity. Shadow Sneak can revenge kill frailer Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A, while Stone Edge 2HKOes both Yveltal, which can OHKO Giratina-O with Dark Pulse, and Ho-Oh, which can inflict status such as Toxic onto Giratina-O.</li> <li>20 Defense EVs allow Giratina-O to avoid a 2HKO from Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike, while 228 Attack EVs ensure that Shadow Sneak is a 2HKO on Mega Mewtwo Y and Ultra Necrozma after taking Stealth Rock damage as Necrozma-DM and that Poltergeist can 3HKO defensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. 12 Speed EVs are necessary to always outspeed Calyrex-I and Kingambit. Note that an EV spread of 248 HP / 56 Atk / 192 Def / 12 Spe with an Impish nature can be used if not running Shadow Sneak to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Salamence's Double Edge while still 2HKOing defensive Necrozma-DM with Poltergeist.</li> <li>Tera Poison on Giratina-O provides it with a Fairy resistance against Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy and Zacian-C while also providing it with a Toxic immunity, helping its longevity. Tera Poison is the best option to use with the second EV spread, as it allows Giratina-O to act as a Zacian-C check by letting it avoid the 2HKO from +1 Tera Electric Wild Charge after Stealth Rock damage, allowing Giratina-O to freely phaze it with Dragon Tail or burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Tera Steel has a similar role while also providing resistances to Dragon and Ice for foes such as Eternatus and Calyrex-I, at the cost of giving Giratina-O a weakness to Fire-type attacks such as Primal Groudon's Heat Crash and Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Fighting-type attacks such as Zacian-C's Close Combat and Marshadow's Low Kick. Tera Rock keeps the Fire resistance while giving Stone Edge variants a boost, allowing Giratina-O to OHKO Ho-Oh from full health and have a chance to OHKO specially offensive Yveltal. It also allows Giratina-O to handle Flying-types like Mega Salamence and Rayquaza better.</li> <li>Health management is crucial, as it determines Giratina-O's effectiveness at checking certain threats, especially since it has no reliable recovery outside of Rest, so avoiding unnecessary damage, whether it be stray super effective damage like Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam or status conditions like Toxic from Ho-Oh, is key.</li> <li>Giratina-O's typing leaves it weak against common Fairy-, Dark-, Ghost- and Dragon-types, such as Arceus-Fairy, Yveltal, Marshadow, and Eternatus; as such, Necrozma-DM for Fairy- and Dragon-types, Yveltal for Dark- and Ghost-types, and Arceus-Fairy for Dark- and Dragon-types are all good partners.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Pokemon such as Zygarde and Ho-Oh can help Giratina-O more comfortably wall physical threats like Primal Groudon in case it becomes too weakened to effectively serve as a check.</li> </ul>"

Rest is also an option to raise Giratina-O's longevity if it's not required as a Defogger, becoming a more consistent check to foes such as Zygardeand Primal Groudon in the long run, but is limited to stall teams, as it's far easier to take advantage of without cleric support</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM, offensive Arceus-Ground, and Extreme Killer Arceus; Toxic allows Giratina-O to severely cut into the longevity of Pokemon including Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Primal Kyogre; and Thunder Wave cripples checks it lures on the switch like Zacian-C and Yveltal.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike after Stealth Rock, and Primal Groudon's Eruption after Stealth Rock. This spread also ensures a 2HKO on Eruption Primal Groudon with Draco Meteor.</li> <li>Tera Poison leaves Giratina-O with only a single weakness, enabling it as a blanket wall for a good portion of the metagame, especially as it loses its common weaknesses, turning it into a check for foes such as Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Arceus-Fairy. Tera Steel alongside Levitate ensures that Giratina handles Ground- and Rock-type moves, allowing Giratina-O to completely wall Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon without Fire-type moves, and all variants of Arceus-Ground, as well as better handle Extreme Killer Arceus with Shadow Claw. Both Tera type options also render it immune to Toxic from foes such as support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Eternatus, improving its longevity.</li> <li>As Giratina-O lacks reliable recovery, it's best to avoid letting it become crippled by a burn or bad poisoning from foes such as Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes, as it can get worn down considerably and have trouble handling what it's meant to check properly. As Giratina-O Terastallizes, it loses some valuable resistances and immunities, so if foes it strongly checks as is such as Arceus and Primal Groudon with Fire-type moves are on the other team, it's best to preserve Tera for later on, when deemed pertinent either for Giratina-O or an ally instead.</li> <li>Giratina-O often lures switches, as it can be rather passive, especially after using Draco Meteor, so it's often more desirable to spread status than to use attacks, especially as crippling foes benefits Hex.</li> <li>Giratina-O can't wall Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, Yveltal, and Eternatus without Terastallizing. Therefore, it appreciates allies such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Depending on the status move Giratina-O has chosen, it can be rendered unable to make progress against certain foes. Will-O-Wisp sets can be passive against foes such as Arceus-Dark and Ho-Oh, Thunder Wave sets can struggle against support Arceus formes with Refresh and especially Arceus-Ground, and Toxic sets have a poor matchup against Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM. Because of this, Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground with Power Gem, Primal Kyogre, and Primal Groudon are great allies.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus's great stats and amazing movepool make it one of the tier's most effective wallbreakers and sweepers.</li> <li>Swords Dance pairs excellently with Extreme Speed almost always bypassing the target's Speed. Dragon Dance is fairly niche because Arceus generally needs +2 Attack to OHKO most foes like Mega Mewtwo Y and Ultra Necrozma, but it offers benefits like letting Arceus move before opposing Arceus and Steel-types such as Zacian-C and boosted Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Shadow Claw targets Giratina-O, which is immune to both Extreme Speed and Earthquake, and it has the added benefit of hitting Necrozma-DM and Marshadow for super effective damage.</li> <li>Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM and serves as coverage against Primal Groudon.</li> <li>In the place of coverage, Taunt can be used to stop status, recovery moves, and entry hazards from foes like Zygarde, Giratina-O, and Ferrothorn. Recover is another alternative that allows Arceus to stay healthy while taking weaker hits from foes like Ferrothorn and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Leftovers is the preferred item, since it gives Arceus more staying power. Lum Berry lets Arceus avoid status one time, letting it more easily forgo Taunt and take on Ho-Oh better. Silk Scarf increases the power of Extreme Speed, letting +2 Arceus OHKO foes like wallbreaker Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma. Life Orb augments the power of all Arceus's moves; for example, at +2 it can OHKO offensive variants of Yveltal with Extreme Speed and Necrozma-DM with Earthquake,though it gets worn down faster by the recoil damage.</li> <li>The given EV spread maximizes Arceus's Attack while letting it outspeed 252 Speed EV Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre with a neutral nature, with the remaining EVs being dumped into HP to maximize its bulk. 56 Speed EVs should be used with Dragon Dance to allow Arceus to outspeed Zacian-C at +1.</li> <li>Tera Ghost providing an immunity to Arceus's only weakness in Fighting as well as Normal can give it an extra turn against foes such as Marshadow, Zacian-C, and opposing Arceus. It also increases the power of Shadow Claw against Ghost-types, notably giving it good odds to OHKO Giratina-O at +2 and always letting it do so with Life Orb. However, this leaves Arceus more vulnerable to Marshadow's Shadow Sneak and Dark-types that can tank Extreme Speed like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Tera Normal increases the power of Extreme Speed to unspeakable levels, giving it a chance to OHKO foes such as bulky Primal Kyogre and defensive Ho-Oh when boosted by Life Orb at +2.</li> <li>Tera Fire is niche, but it lets Arceus become immune to burn and resist Fire, notably helping it when faced with Ho-Oh. Tera Fire granting resistances to Zacian-C's STAB moves and removing Arceus's Fighting-type weakness also lets the latter reliably beat the former.</li> <li>Arceus best fits on offense teams, notably hyper offense teams, looking for a powerful sweeper that isn't stopped by fast revenge killers like Mega Mewtwo Y, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf users like Yveltal.</li> <li>Arceus struggles with physically bulky foes such as Zygarde and Ho-Oh, which can trade hits with and status it. It is also notably walled by Dondozo. Fellow wallbreaking and sweeping teammates such as Ultra Necrozma and Meteor Beam Eternatus can form offensive cores with Arceus, which are effective at pressuring these foes.</li> <li>Dual screens support from Deoxys-S and Grimmsnarl is great for hyper offense teams, letting Arceus set up more easily. This is especially important if Arceus is running Dragon Dance, which usually needs two turns to set up. Entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S and Shuckle can weaken the opposing team, letting Arceus KO them more easily.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With access to STAB Foul Play, high defensive stats, and its mono-Dark typing, Arceus-Dark effectively checks Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Arceus, Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Salamence, making it one of the most reliable defensive Arceus formes in NatDex Ubers.</li> <li>Foul Play is absolutely essential for Arceus-Dark, as it serves two crucial roles: first, it allows Arceus-Dark to effectively revenge kill boosted threats such as Primal Groudon, Arceus, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Salamence. Second, it acts as a deterrent, dissuading these threats from setting up until Arceus-Dark has been sufficiently weakened.</li> <li>Toxic is the preferred status move for Arceus-Dark, primarily to cripple common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Fairy. Will-O-Wisp presents a viable alternative for hitting Zacian-C and Marshadow, which is particularly relevant given Zacian-C's resistance to Foul Play.</li> <li>Refresh is a solid choice when Arceus-Dark is utilized as a primary Knock Off and status absorber for the team, since it can reliably  switch into Toxic Yveltal or Eternatus. However, in other scenarios, it's not recommended since it would render Arceus-Dark too passive against the aforementioned threats.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Dark to greatly limit most of the entry hazard setters in the tier, namely Primal Groudon, Defensive Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, it can neutralize status spreaders like Toxic Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Giratina-Origin, while also restricting the former's ability to use Defog. Taunt Arceus-Dark is also one of the best checks to Zygarde-C, as it can completely shut down its ability to spread paralysis and set up.</li> <li>Defog serves as a good filler move when Arceus-Dark acts as hazard control over common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Stealth Rock can be a viable option to free up teammates to fulfill other roles; for example, it alows Primal Groudon to run more offensive sets such as Swords Dance, or fit Spikes on defensive set. In addition, Arceus-Dark's typing and movepool allow it to set up Stealth Rock on common Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and most opposing Arceus formes, all of which are threatened by Arceus-Dark's status moves.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark's EV spread enables it to be faster than common base 90 Speed foes and also facilitates its role as a revenge killer against offensive Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, investing in Speed with EVs of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe and a Timid nature allows Arceus-Dark to outspeed Pokémon like Yveltal, Zekrom, and Rayquaza, and still survive a Life Orb Low Kick from Marshadow.</li> <li>Tera Poison lets Arceus Dark acts as an emergency check to boosted Marshadow and Tera Fighting Zacian-C, making it possible to safely revenge kill them. Moreover, by becoming a Poison-type, Arceus-Dark becomes immune to Toxic, making it possible for non-Taunt versions to beat Toxic Yveltal one-on-one. However, Tera Poison makes Arceus-Dark extremely vulnerable to Photon Geyser Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Deoxys-A, thus trainers should think twice before Terastallizing Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Utility Arceus-Dark is an excellent fit for balance and defensive teams, offering a check to Zygarde-C and and other common physical sweepers such as Ultra Necrozma. Depending on the set used, some precautions should be taken with Arceus-Dark. Non-Refresh sets need to scout for Toxic before switching into Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Similarly, it is important to scout for Glare Zygarde since Arceus-Dark doesn't enjoy being paralyzed.</li> <li>Stealth Rock from Arceus-Dark itself or a teammate  like Primal Groudon can wear down Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy that can switch into Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Since Necrozma-DM, the premier Toxic absorber of the tier, is heavily threatened by Foul Play, Arceus-Dark can often freely use Toxic on a predicted switch-in.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Arceus can overwhelm Arceus-Dark. To improve its matchup against these threats, teammates like Zygarde-C, Ferrothorn, and Ditto can provide valuable support.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Groudon serves as a great partner for Arceus-Dark, threatening Eternatus, which walls Arceus-Dark. A similar role is accomplished by Ho-Oh, especially sets carrying Thunder Wave, which can make Arceus-Dark faster than it. Additionally, Ho-Oh appreciates Arceus-Dark's ability to deal with Knock Off Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is another partner that benefits from Arceus-Dark's ability to cripple Primal Groudon and Yveltal, and it provides a Fairy resistance and Toxic immunity in return.</li> <li>Cleric support from Pokemon such as Magearna and Chansey can mitigate non-Refresh Arceus-Dark's weakness to status conditions.</li> </ul>"

It is able to switch into multiple top threats of the metagame such as Mega Salamence, Yveltal, Zygarde, Arceus-Dark, and Marshadow and cripple them with various options or set Stealth Rock as they're forced out, enabling it to fit in balance and defensive team structures.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Fairy to prevent setup, recovery, entry hazards, hazard control via Defog, and crippling status moves such as Glare and Toxic from Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Zygarde, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O. This move isn't recommended on specially defensive variants, as it's relatively easy for foes, such as some variants of the Pokemon listed above, to outspeed Arceus-Fairy, thus rendering most of Taunt's purposes niche.</li> <li>Toxic complements Judgment to cripple foes that can easily switch into it, including Ho-Oh, Arceus-Ground, and Primal Groudon, Will-O-Wisp alternatively allows Arceus-Fairy to cripple the Poison- and Steel-types it lures in, such as Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus, while also creating an easier matchup against multiple physical attackers such as Terastallized Zygarde and Marshadow.</li> <li>Stealth Rock forces progress for Arceus-Fairy's team, as it forces out relevant hazard removers such as Yveltal and Giratina-O. With Stealth Rock active, Arceus-Fairy has high odds to OHKO Ultra Necrozma and Palkia-O with Judgment.</li> <li>Given Arceus-Fairy can often stay in on common hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, if Arceus-Fairy has Toxic, and opposing support Arceus formes, it can act as a viable Defogger.</li> <li>Refresh increases Arceus-Fairy's longevity and consistency at checking foes, reducing the potential risk of switching into Glare from Zygarde and Toxic from Ho-Oh, Arceus-Dark, and Primal Groudon. It also renders special sets of Giratina-O unable to do much in return, as Hex does poor damage without a status condition.</li> <li>The given EV spread with a Bold nature allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Primal Groudon to better facilitate using Taunt and Recover, with the rest of the EVs being placed in Defense to render it as physically bulky as possible, letting it avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Poltergeist.</li> <li>Alternatively, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 108 SpD / 16 Spe with a Calm nature lets Arceus-Fairy avoid a 2HKO from Palkia-O's Hydro Pump and Primal Groudon's Overheat and a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Spectral Thief after Stealth Rock, and it can outspeed uninvested Primal Groudon. Additionally it also allows Arceus-Fairy to check Mega Mewtwo Y, and after Terastallizing to the Poison-type, Eternatus. This spread, however, has the flaws of being easier to overwhelm by physical attackers and vulnerability to Taunt from Pokemon such as other defensive Arceus formes and Terastallized Yveltal.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Arceus-Fairy more comfortably wall foes such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, in turn allowing Arceus-Fairy to cripple them with a status condition. Arceus-Fairy also gains a resistance to Palkia-O's Hydro Pump, granting it the momentum to greatly damage it even if it uses its physically defensive spread.</li> <li>Tera Poison increases Arceus-Fairy's longevity by giving it an immunity to Toxic and removing its weaknesses to Steel- and Poison-type moves, letting it switch into Zacian-C, Eternatus without Meteor Beam, Giratina-O, Arceus-Dark, and opposing Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is a Pokemon that does not Terastallize often, as its innate typing already provides the option to act as a wall for a good portion of the metagame, and its allies often make better use of it.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy's Judgment is often easy to switch into early- to mid-game, so most of the time utility moves are used instead for consistency and to continue making progress by crippling the other team.</li> <li>Depending on the moveset, Arceus-Fairy can't respond to foes that resist Judgment such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM; therefore, it appreciates Pokemon that can answer them, which include Giratina-O, Primal Kyogre, and Marshadow.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy's bulk can be lacking on one side depending on its EV spread. Physically defensive variants can struggle against Palkia-O, Eternatus, and Arceus formes with Calm Mind, so it appreciates checks to them to complement its own defensive attributes like Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon. Meanwhile, specially defensive variants can have notable difficulties checking physical sweepers, which include Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence and Arceus, so Pokemon that can switch into them such as Giratina-O and Necrozma-DM are appreciated.</li> </ul>"

Power Gem is an option to hit Ho-Oh for meaningful damage. Taunt can be used to prevent Giratina-O, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh from crippling Arceus-Fairy with status such as Toxic or Thunder Wave and phazing it with Roar or Whirlwind.

The alternative EV spread with a Timid nature allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Modest Palkia-O and avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow’s Spectral Thief after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Tera Dark provides Arceus-Fairy with a Psychic immunity, helping its team against powerful attacks such as Light That Burns the Sky from Ultra Necrozma, Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A, and Psystrike from Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Tera Poison provides Arceus-Fairy a valuable immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes, allowing it to serve as the team’s Toxic Spikes absorber and check to opposing Arceus-Fairy and Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Ground ensures that Earth Power 2HKOes defensive Primal Groudon at +0 and gives it a chance to 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM at +1.</li> <li>On hyper offense, Arceus-Fairy is an excellent late-game wincon against a weakened team when checks such as Ho-Oh and Eternatus have been removed. On bulky offense and balance, Arceus-Fairy serves as an excellent check to Marshadow, Yveltal, and unboosted Mega Salamence throughout the game. It should not be afraid to switch into attacks from the aforementioned Pokemon, as any damage can be healed off with Recover. Arceus-Fairy must be wary of Toxic from Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O, which can heavily undermine its ability to sweep.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy’s sweeping ability is often hampered due to it being outsped by common threats such as Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Deoxys-A. For hyper offense, Sticky Web support from Shuckle flips these matchups and allows Arceus-Fairy to beat these checks. For bulky offense and balance, Thunder Wave support from Necrozma-DM eliminates this problem. Arceus-Fairy also appreciates duel screens support from Deoxys-S or Grimmsnarl, as this eases setup.</li> <li>Regardless of what is chosen in the fourth moveslot, Arceus-Fairy will always suffer from a lack of coverage, as having Power Gem means it struggles against Primal Groudon, and having Earth Power means it cannot break past Ho-Oh. Teammates that can cover these vulnerabilities such as Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma are helpful. Gothitelle is also a good teammate, as it effectively traps and removes walls such as Tera Steel Giratina-O, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Physical Arceus-Ground is an excellent wallbreaker and sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. It easily finds turns to boost due to scaring out common Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Additionally, physical Arceus-Ground benefits from the presence of the more common defensive and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground sets, as it is able to beat switch-ins expecting to check other Arceus-Ground sets such as Primal Kyogre and Palkia-O.</li> <li>Dragon Dance is Arceus-Ground's primary boosting move. Alternatively, Swords Dance is a viable option, as Sticky Web support enables Arceus-Ground to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with the exception of specially offensive Yveltal.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground's last moveslot should be tailored to best support its team. On hyper offense teams, Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Yveltal from removing entry hazards while also protecting Arceus-Ground from status moves. Recover enables Arceus-Ground to perform the defensive duties expected of it on bulky offense teams, such as switching into Primal Groudon multiple times while remaining healthy enough to sweep late-game. Healing Wish is also an option on hyper offense teams to give a teammate such as Zacian-C or Ultra Necrozma a second chance at sweeping.</li> <li>As Ultra Necrozma is a staple on hyper offense teams, Arceus-Ground typically equips an Earth Plate. Bulky offense teams appreciate Arceus-Ground's ability to OHKO Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and wallbreaker Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock with Tectonic Rage. Arceus-Ground's ability to OHKO defensive Primal Groudon and utility Arceus formes with Tectonic Rage after a Swords Dance is appreciated by many Sticky Web teams.</li> <li>The given EV spread maximizes Arceus-Ground's mixed bulk while allowing it to outspeed Primal Groudon and maximize damage output. This ensures that it outspeeds most of the defensive metagame and can revenge kill Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. The defensive investment prevents Arceus-Ground from being OHKOed by Necrozma-DM's Searing Sunraze Smash, Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost, and Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent after a single layer of Spikes. Arceus-Ground also survives Tectonic Rage and +1 Tera Ground Earthquake from opposing Arceus-Ground. Additionally, the spread allows +2 Arceus-Ground to avoid the OHKO from Choice Scarf Yveltal's Foul Play after Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes, enabling Arceus-Ground to remove an otherwise dangerous threat to many offensive teams.</li> <li>Tera Ground enables Arceus-Ground to OHKO some targets without a boost, such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after a single layer of Spikes and defensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Tera Rock is an alternate option to OHKO switch-ins such as Mega Salamence switching in on a Dragon Dance after Stealth Rock with Stone Edge. At +1, Tera Rock Stone Edge OHKOes defensive Yveltal and 2HKOes Giratina-O after Stealth Rock. Tera Rock can also be used defensively to resist common priority move such as Arceus's and Rayquaza's Extreme Speed.</li> <li>On hyper offense teams, Arceus-Ground is best used as a mid-game wallbreaker to remove Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM. On bulky offense teams, it is best used early-game due to its positive matchups against both common hazard setters such as Primal Groudon and Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Arceus-Ground should be kept reasonably healthy, as it is often able to sweep late-game after a boost. It also struggles against stall teams, as it is walled by Dondozo and phazed by Giratina-O, though Taunt is disruptive to many stall teams.</li> <li>Shuckle is a great Sticky Web user to enable Swords Dance Arceus-Ground. Kyurem-B synergizes well with Arceus-Ground, as it is able to break through Dondozo and exploit Tera Grass Ho-Oh, which walls Arceus-Ground. Zacian-C also appreciates Arceus-Ground's efficacy in removing Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh while helping against Arceus-Dark. Specially offensive Yveltal is also a great partner that threatens most of the defensive metagame and dissuades Ditto from using Earthquake after copying Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>On bulky offense teams, utility Swords Dance Primal Groudon provides Stealth Rock support and a switch-in to Primal Kyogre, which scares out an unboosted Arceus-Ground. Choice Band Marshadow is an excellent teammate that is able to revenge kill Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C, which threaten a chipped Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

Its typing hits some of the most relevant threats in the metagame super effectively while also giving it few weaknesses and relevant resistances, allowing it to answer a variety of foes such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, and Yveltal and turning it into a versatile pick for a wide variety of team structures.</li> <li>Toxic allows Arceus-Ground to hinder switch-ins immune to Judgment like Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Yveltal; Ice Beam alternatively complements Judgment to hit all previously mentioned foes but Ho-Oh, as well as Zygarde, super effectively. Taunt prevents entry hazards from Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn, Defog from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, disruptive moves such as Glare, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp from Zygarde, Yveltal, and Giratina-O, and setup and recovery moves from Zygarde, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM, rendering them easier to beat.</li> <li>Stealth Rock provides general utility to support the rest of Arceus-Ground's team, helping wallbreaking allies such as Primal Groudon and Zacian-C to net more OHKOs as they force switches.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Marshadow's Low Kick after Stealth Rock and a 2HKO from Zacian-C's Play Rough after Intrepid Sword and Stealth Rock. The Speed investment ensures Arceus-Ground outspeeds fully invested Primal Groudon, and the remaining EVs are used on Special Attack to raise the odds to OHKO Zacian-C and Zekrom after Stealth Rock with Judgment.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground is a Pokemon that doesn't Terastallize often, as its allies usually make better use of the mechanic. Tera Poison renders it unable to check Ground-types such as Primal Groudon, opposing Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde and makes it weaker to Stealth Rock. However, Tera Poison raises the accuracy of Toxic, increases Arceus-Ground's longevity by making it immune to Toxic itself from foes such as Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal, enables it to wall further foes such as Marshadow and Eternatus, and lets it absorb Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, supporting its team with entry hazard control.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground's special bulk can be too lacking at times to handle foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Lunala; as such, it appreciates partners to make a defensive core with, such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Yveltal. Water-types such as Primal Kyogre, Palkia-O, and Arceus-Water can easily break past Arceus-Ground; therefore, it appreciates Pokemon on its side like Primal Groudon, Eternatus, and Ferrothorn to handle them.</li> <li>Wallbreakers that can break past foes Arceus-Ground can't do much against on its own are valuable to ease progress. For example, Zacian-C threatens Giratina-O and Mega Mewtwo Y for Arceus-Ground sets without Toxic, Primal Kyogre covers Ho-Oh and Zygarde for variants without both Ice Beam and Toxic, and Marshadow can make progress against Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Primal Groudon independently of Arceus-Ground's set, especially with Stealth Rock support from Arceus-Ground to wear down the other team.</li> </ul>"

It also greatly annoys common Rock-resistant Pokemon, such as Zygarde, Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Stealth Rock is a good option, since Arceus-Rock threatens common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal, keeping it up consistently. Taunt lets Arceus-Rock deny foes' attempts to recover health or spread status. Refresh lets Arceus-Rock shrug off Toxic and burns from Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, and Arceus-Dark. Ice Beam can be ran in the third slot to lure in and catch Zygarde off guard.</li> <li>The given EV spread enables Arceus-Rock to avoid a 2HKO from specially offensive Yveltal's Dark Pulse, avoid an OHKO from +1 Adamant Mega Salamence's Earthquake after Stealth Rock, and almost always avoid an OHKO from +1 Life Orb Rayquaza's Earthquake while having enough Speed to outpace Chi-Yu. The rest of the EVs are invested to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Tera Rock lets Arceus-Rock fire off more powerful Judgments, notably letting it OHKO defensive Yveltal and 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon, offensive Eternatus, and offensive Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock, while retaining its ability to check Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. Tera Grass can also be used to turn its weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, providing defensive insurance for Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock should be used aggressively to chip the opposing team with STAB Judgment, which is difficult to switch into, while burning the opposing Rock-resistant foes, such as Zacian-C and Marshadow, and pressuring common forms of hazard control. This role is expanded upon when facing Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence, in which case Arceus-Rock should be preserved to check these threats.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock appreciates teammates like Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus that cover its numerous weaknesses to common moves, such as Arceus-Ground's Earthquake and Kyogre's Origin Pulse, while they, in turn, appreciate Arceus-Rock's ability to check strong physical attackers like Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Running Stealth Rock on Arceus-Rock can allow Primal Groudon to run more offensive sets. Pokemon that appreciate Arceus-Rock burning Steel-types, such as Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Mega Salamence, are good partners, as they can set up more easily. Mega Salamence is especially good to pair with, as it checks Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre offensively and can use a burned Necrozma-DM lacking status moves as setup fodder.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock and Gothitelle make a good pairing, since Arceus-Rock can burn physical attackers such as Zygarde, Necrozma-DM, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground to make Gothitelle's trapping more consistent; in turn, Gothitelle takes out these Ground- and Steel-types that threaten Arceus-Rock.</li> </ul>"

The ability to check Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde with Judgment, as well as switch in on Primal Groudon and defensive Primal Kyogre, makes Arceus-Water an important defensive Pokemon for certain balance and bulky offense teams.</li> <li>Judgment is a reliable STAB option that deals decent damage to Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde while hitting Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground super effectively. Toxic cripples the longevity of opposing defensive Pokemon like support Arceus formes, Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Yveltal while also preventing Primal Kyogre from switching in freely, which would otherwise wall Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's positive matchup into Ho-Oh makes it a reliable Stealth Rock user, with Toxic limiting Giratina-O and support Arceus formes as well. Refresh removes any status conditions, notably bad poisoning from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O as well as paralysis from Necrozma-DM and Zygarde that would otherwise cripple Arceus-Water and limit its effectiveness at checking certain Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM. Taunt prevents foes from setting up on Arceus-Water for free, whether it be entry hazards or stat boosts from Pokemon like Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Coil Zygarde. Ice Beam is an alternative option to avoid being passive against Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza, which could all set up on Arceus-Water with ease, while also allowing Arceus-Water to OHKO Zygarde, but this comes at the cost of significantly limiting Arceus-Water's utility options.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Water to always outspeed Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Zekrom while maximizing its physical bulk, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Poltergeist and Double Dance Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Tera Fairy provides a valuable Dark resistance, letting Arceus-Fairy handle Yveltal more comfortably while also providing a resistance to Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Marshadow as well as an immunity to Dragon-type moves from Giratina-O.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's great bulk and uncommon weaknesses allow it to come in on most neutral hits in the tier, including Mega Salamence's Double-Edge and Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser, making it a solid defensive pivot for its teammates. Running Refresh also enables Arceus-Water to switch in more recklessly against Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and opposing support Arceus formes without fear of any inflicted status conditions. However, Arceus-Water has significant four-moveslot-syndrome; if not running Judgment, it will struggle against Ho-Oh, while it will struggle against Primal Groudon if not running Taunt or Ice Beam. Alongside this, Arceus-Water's passive nature makes it prone to being set up on, especially against Pokemon like Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Eternatus, so it's ideal to have teammates such as Zygarde and Ho-Oh that can handle these threats.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are good partners to Arceus-Water, as they both can check Eternatus, which would be able to set up on Arceus-Water easily, while Arceus-Water can check Zygarde and defensive Primal Kyogre in return. Refresh Arceus-Water's ability to soak up status conditions, particularly from Ho-Oh, which can only use Toxic against it, is also greatly valued by Primal Groudon, which is prone to being worn down by Toxic; even without Refresh, Arceus-Water's ability to threaten Ho-Oh offensively with Judgment is handy.</li> <li>Dragon-types like Mega Salamence and Giratina-O can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type moves that threaten Arceus-Water, and in turn it can switch into the Ice-type moves they fear, such as Calyrex-Ice's Glacial Lance; the former is also able to check offensive Primal Groudon, which Arceus-Water is completely helpless against if not running Taunt or Ice Beam.</li> <li>Since Arceus-Water struggles to prevent Stealth Rock against Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, especially if not running Taunt, Defoggers such as Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal are needed to ensure Arceus-Water doesn't get worn down by hazards in longer games.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Water's excellent typing, supplemented by superb natural bulk, is attractive to balance teams looking for a sweeper that also contributes defensively as a switch-in to specially offensive Yveltal, a Pokemon balance teams lacking Arceus-Fairy notoriously struggle with, while also scaring out Ho-Oh.</li> <li>As Judgment, Calm Mind, and Recover are all mandatory, Arceus-Water only has one moveslot left for coverage. Unfortunately, there is no singular move that perfectly compliments Judgment, leaving Arceus-Water reliant on teammates to handle certain Pokemon it does not have coverage for. Ice Beam enables Arceus-Water to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall it such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Giratina-O while ensuring Primal Groudon does not switch in freely. Alternatively, Earth Power heavily punishes Primal Groudon attempting to freely switch in on Judgment while preventing Arceus-Water from being walled by Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and opposing Arceus-Water.</li> <li>The given EV spread ensures that Arceus-Water outspeeds fully invested neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Furthermore, the high investment in bulk enables Arceus-Water to survive some monstrously powerful attacks including Basculegion's Last Respects after five fainted allies, +3 Zacian-C's Wild Charge, Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock, and Tera Flying Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent after Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes. Additionally, Arceus-Water avoids the 2HKO from Double Dance Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and Choice Band Marshadow's Low Kick.</li> <li>Though Arceus-Water rarely Terastallizes, it can still effectively utilize its Tera type in a pinch to help flip certain matchups or to facilitate a sweep. Tera Fairy transforms Arceus-Water from a passable to sturdy specially offensive Yveltal check while retaining a stellar defensive typing and becoming a good Marshadow check. Tera Poison is an alternate option that enables Arceus-Water to more consistently sweep bulkier balance teams. The newfound Toxic immunity enables Arceus-Water to switch into Ho-Oh and defensive Eternatus with impunity and use them as setup fodder. Absorbing Eternatus's Toxic Spikes has the added benefit of alleviating pressure on teammates to use Defog. However, Arceus-Water's new weakness to the omnipresent Ground-type attacks from Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground means that Tera Poison should be used cautiously.</li> <li>Arceus-Water excels against balance and bulky offense teams. It has a strong mid-game presence, as it prevents Ho-Oh, defensive Yveltal, and—if Arceus-Water runs Ice Beam—Giratina-O from freely removing entry hazards. However, Arceus-Water should do so cautiously, as all three commonly run Toxic, which can prevent Arceus-Water from sweeping in the end-game. Arceus-Water lacks the ability to make progress against stall teams and is overwhelmed by hyper offense teams due to a lack of power before boosting.</li> <li>As Arceus-Water has coverage issues regardless of whether it runs Ice Beam or Earth Power, it relies on teammates to fill these gaps. Zygarde is an excellent choice as a blanket physical wall that checks Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Rayquaza, and Mega Salamence. Zygarde also alleviates pressure on Arceus-Water defensively, which enables it to more consistently sweep. In return, Arceus-Water checks Taunt Arceus-Ground and specially offensive Yveltal, which shut down Zygarde. Ferrothorn is also an excellent teammate due to checking wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, which can easily run through many balance teams, especially if a Timid nature is used. Arceus-Water also appreciates offensive partners such as Choice Band Marshadow and specially offensive Yveltal, which thrive against the hyper offense and stall teams that Arceus-Water struggles with due to their ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> </ul>"

Aside from boosting Arceus-Water's Special Attack, it also allows it to turn the tables on some switch-ins that typically check it such as Eternatus and Palkia-O; in conjunction with Recover, it provides Arceus-Water with the longevity needed to continuously take on strong special attacks from foes like Eternatus and offensive Yveltal in order to set up on them.</li> <li>Earth Power enables Arceus-Water to threaten foes that can take Water-type moves, 2HKOing Primal Groudon and Eternatus at +1. Grass Knot can also be used instead of Earth Power to hit heavy Water-types like Primal Kyogre, Palkia-O, and opposing Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's choice of Tera type is determined by the coverage move it runs. Tera Ground boosts Earth Power to muscle through Primal Groudon and Zacian-C with an OHKO on both at +1 whilst granting it an immunity to Electric-type attacks from Zekrom and Primal Kyogre. Tera Grass is used to power up Grass Knot, and at +1 it has a chance to OHKO Primal Kyogre and deal significant damage to Zygarde whilst resisting its Ground-type STAB moves and the aforementioned Electric-type Arceus-Water best fits on bulky and hyper offense teams that appreciate its great bulk and typing.</li> <li>It is preferable to use Arceus-Water early-game to blow holes into the opposing team's defensive core, as it can easily use Calm Mind on the likes of Ho-Oh and Zygarde and force progress, which is appreciated by teammates such as Necrozma-DM and offensive Primal Groudon. It also has good synergy with the aforementioned teammates, as it helps them beat physical walls like Zygarde and opposing Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Although Arceus-Water has good Special Attack, it struggles to beat special walls such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Giratina, so teammates like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Zacian-C are appreciated.</li> <li>Fairy-types like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy help Arceus-Water deal with Dragon-type foes, as it struggles to deal damage to foes such as Ultra Necrozma, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza.

Alomomola is useful as a defensive pivot that can shrug off damage thanks to Regenerator, as a status spreader, and as a Wish passer that increases the longevity of its teammates.</li> <li>Toxic allows Alomomola to cripple the longevity of Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and support Arceus formes lacking Refresh. Toxic is especially useful against Primal Groudon and Zygarde, as it keeps Alomomola from being easily set up on while forcing Zygarde to waste Rest PP.</li> <li>Wish allows Alomomola to increase its longevity as well as the longevity of its teammates by providing recovery for allies such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, and Specially Offensive Yveltal that have no reliable recovery options. A slow Flip Turn allows Alomomola to safely pass a Wish to the aforementioned Pokemon. Increased longevity allows these teammates to check Zacian-C, Primal Groudon, Arceus, and Marshadow with more efficiency during the game.</li> <li>Protect allows Alomomola to more easily receive a Wish from itself, scout Choice item sets from Marshadow, Yveltal, and Eternatus, and maximize Toxic damage on the foe.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to freely pivot without worrying about entry hazards.</li> <li>The first EV spread maximizes Alomomola's mixed bulk, allowing it to shrug off hits from support Arceus formes and Eternatus. The second EV spread maximizes Alomomola's physical bulk, allowing it to survive a +3 Wild Charge from Zacian-C and two uses of Glacial Lance from Choice Band Calyrex-I. Having 0 Speed IVs allows Alomomola to perform a slow Flip Turn against Chansey and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Tera Dark allows Alomomola to absorb powerful Psychic-type attacks such as Light that Burns the Sky from Ultra Necrozma and Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A. Tera Dark also makes Alomomola one of the few walls capable of handling Deoxys-A thanks to Alomomola's low weight lessening the power of Low Kick. After switching in, Alomomola can immediately threaten to OHKO Deoxys-A with Flip Turn after Stealth Rock and a turn of Life Orb damage.</li> <li>Tera Poison prevents Alomomola from becoming poisoned, allowing it to serve as a switch-in to Toxic Ho-Oh and utility Arceus formes. Tera Poison also allows Alomomola to absorb Toxic Spikes from Eternatus to keep teammates such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and support Arceus formes status-free, although switching into Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground becomes harder.</li> <li>Alomomola is able to swap into any unboosted physical attack besides Bolt Strike from Zekrom throughout the game consistently, since it can use Regenerator to heal itself back up. It can swap in on Mega Salamence or Arceus-Ground and pivot with Flip Turn to safely bring in an answer such as Arceus-Fairy or Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Thanks to Alomomola's Wish support, teammates without reliable recovery such as Primal Groudon and Giratina-O can switch into Primal Kyogre and Arceus more aggressively throughout the game without worrying about slowly being chipped down.</li> <li>Wallbreaker Primal Kyogre makes it near impossible for Alomomola to safely pass a Wish, so teammates such as Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon are helpful.</li> <li>Alomomola will often get overwhelmed by physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, and Arceus, so teammates such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark help ease Alomomola's workload.</li> <li>Alomomola provides excellent slow pivoting, so Pokemon that capitalize on a free switch such as Deoxys-A, Choice Band Marshadow, Choice Band Chien-Pao, and Meteor Beam Eternatus make excellent teammates.</li> </ul>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Ferrothorn's stellar typing, high bulk, and rare access to Spikes grant it a unique position in the metagame as the cornerstone of hazard-stacking balance teams over Pokemon such as defensive Necrozma-DM. Ferrothorn serves as a sturdy roadblock to wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, which otherwise easily overwhelms most balance teams. Additionally, Ferrothorn checks Ground-types such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde. However, Ferrothorn struggles against more offensive teams, as Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Mega Salamence are able to take advantage of Ferrothorn's passivity to use it as setup fodder.</li> <li>Power Whip provides Ferrothorn the means to scare out Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Ground. Wallbreaker Primal Kyogre is OHKOed after Stealth Rock, and defensive Arceus-Ground is 2HKOed after a single layer of Spikes. Ferrothorn is able to capitalize on the switches it forces to set a layer of Spikes or use Leech Seed to help keep itself healthy. Leech Seed also ensures that Ferrothorn can still defeat defensive Primal Kyogre even when burnt and provides some valuable healing for Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Knock Off is preferred in the last moveslot, as many of Ferrothorn's common switch-ins, such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal, are heavily dependent on their items to function. Protect is an alternative that enables Ferrothorn to rack up healing from Leftovers and Leech Seed and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Rayquaza, Marshadow, and Lunala, but Protect makes it significantly more passive.</li> <li>A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to enable Ferrothorn to outspeed Melmetal under Trick Room. This gives Ferrothorn the flexibility to set a layer of Spikes or Knock Off Melmetal's Choice Band, preventing it from being able to 2HKO Ferrothorn with Tera Steel Double Iron Bash. Ferrothorn maximizes its special bulk to better check wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, as even Water Spout fails to 2HKO.</li> <li>Ferrothorn rarely Terastallizes, as it is reliant on its natural typing to function, but it does benefit from Terastallization in some scenarios. Tera Water swaps Ferrothorn's quadruple Fire weakness for a resistance. While Ferrothorn is not able to meaningfully damage any of the Fire-types in the tier, Tera does enable it to beat Ho-Oh if it is the last Pokemon alive, as Ho-Oh seldom runs recovery and is worn down by Iron Barbs and Leech Seed damage before it is able to knock out Ferrothorn. Tera Grass is an alternative to help Ferrothorn better check Arceus-Ground and Zygarde by turning its neutrality to Ground into a resistance. Tera Grass Power Whip is capable of OHKOing Calm Mind Arceus-Ground after a single layer of Spikes and Leech Seed damage. While Ferrothorn cannot beat Coil Zygarde directly even with Tera Grass, its newfound Ground resistance provides it with extra turns to use Knock Off or Leech Seed before switching to a teammate that can handle Zygarde. Ferrothorn does still have some issues with Dragon Dance Zygarde, however, as it commonly runs Substitute.</li> <li>Ferrothorn is best used in the early- and mid-game to set Spikes against defensive Pokemon such as utility Arceus formes and Alomomola. If Primal Kyogre is on the opposing team, Ferrothorn should prioritize preserving HP until the set is revealed, as it can easily get chipped to where it is unable to switch into wallbreaker Primal Kyogre's Water Spout. Ferrothorn can be used as a lead against hyper offense teams due to its immunity to Smeargle's Spore and Glimmora's Mortal Spin enabling it to break their Focus Sashes easily. Ferrothorn matches up poorly into most hyper offense teams due to its overall passivity, so sacrificing Ferrothorn to deal with suicide leads enables teammates such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark to preserve HP and better handle common threats such as Zacian-C and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Ferrothorn shines against balance and stall teams, as the passive damage it deals racks up over the course of longer games. Many defensive Pokemon are unable to meaningfully damage Ferrothorn, which makes it difficult to wear down. Stall teams in particular have a tough time preventing Ferrothorn from making progress; the only Knock Off absorber, Arceus-Dark, is unable to meaningfully hurt Ferrothorn, as Foul Play activates Iron Barbs. This allows Ferrothorn to keep both itself and its teammates healthy with Leech Seed while freely laying down Spikes.</li> <li>Ferrothorn pairs best with defensive Pokemon that are vulnerable to wallbreaker Primal Kyogre. As such, Zygarde is an excellent teammate for Ferrothorn due to it countering the tier's prominent Fire-types, Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Zygarde is also the best blanket physical wall in the tier and is able to help check physical attackers such as Marshadow and Mega Salamence that are able to break Ferrothorn. Defensive Primal Groudon is also an excellent teammate for Ferrothorn, as it can set Stealth Rock and work in conjunction with Ferrothorn to ensure that Primal Kyogre rarely poses a threat. Ferrothorn can check wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, which often overwhelms Primal Groudon and leaves it unable to check Pokemon such as Zacian-C, while Primal Groudon can remove Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Eternatus that that threaten Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Ferrothorn struggles against Taunt users such as Yveltal and utility Arceus formes. Consequently, Arceus-Fairy is a solid teammate for Ferrothorn, as it counters specially offensive Yveltal and can use Taunt to prevent Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Giratina-O from removing Ferrothorn's Spikes.</li> <li>Choice Band Marshadow is a decent offensive partner for Ferrothorn due to its ability to revenge kill many Pokemon found on hyper offense teams, including Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, and Zacian-C. Ditto can also fill this role, as it threatens to reverse sweep by copying Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Mega Salamence.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Being the sole Electric-type of the tier, Zekrom can remove defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Yveltal. Zekrom's ability, Teravolt, also allows it to break through Dondozo, making it a strong wallbreaker for hyper offense structures.</li> <li>Outrage, when paired with Dragonium Z, becomes a powerful nuke option for Zekrom to use against Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Giratina-O, and Eternatus, all of which resist or are immune to Bolt Strike.</li> <li>Substitute eases predictions, as Zekrom commonly forces switches, and it blocks status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Giratina-O and Toxic from support Arceus formes. It also helps Zekrom set up more easily against Pokemon like Ho-Oh, which attempts to burn Zekrom with Sacred Fire. Roost can be used to give Zekrom more longevity throughout a match and as it sets up.</li> <li>The given EVs allow Zekrom to always outspeed Deoxys-A after a boost while ensuring it survives uninvested Judgment from Arceus-Fairy and two Earth Powers from utility Arceus formes. Alternatively, the second EV spread allows Zekrom to OHKO Ho-Oh, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Primal Kyogre without any boosts, 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM and Extreme Killer Arceus, and OHKO Zacian-C and Dondozo at +1. The Adamant nature also gives Zekrom better chances to OHKO Primal Groudon with +1 Devastating Drake after Stealth Rock while always outspeeding Necrozma-DM, but it cannot outspeed Zacian-C after a boost.</li> <li>Zekrom's unique typing allows it to take hits from Mega Salamence, Primal Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM's STAB moves; however, its exploitable weaknesses and lack of ability to serve as a wall make this trait only useful in a pinch, as Zekrom shouldn't be taking many hits if it wants to sweep effectively. In the scenario where Zekrom struggles to set up, unboosted Devastating Drake is a solid option for weakening foes such as Primal Kyogre, Primal Groudon and Giratina-O to let Zekrom's teammates handle them more easily.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre makes a great partner to Zekrom with its ability to check Primal Groudon, wearing it down for Zekrom to clean up with its Z-Move afterwards. Offensive Necrozma-DM breaks through Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy and Zacian-C for Zekrom to more comfortably use Devastating Drake while also allowing Zekrom to use Outrage once said Fairy-types aren't a factor.</li> <li>Strong physical attackers like Marshadow and Arceus appreciate Zekrom's ability to break through Dondozo, Giratina, and Primal Groudon. Strong special attackers like Calm Mind Arceus formes, Primal Kyogre, and Eternatus also appreciate Zekrom breaking through special walls like Ho-Oh and Chansey, while they can help wear down physical walls like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground so Zekrom can break through them more easily with Dragonium Z.</li> <li>Suicide leads like Shuckle and Smeargle can set up Sticky Web for Zekrom, assisting the secondary EV spread with its drop in Speed while also setting additional entry hazards to meet important damage thresholds; in return, Zekrom offensively pressures Ho-Oh and Yveltal and dissuades them from using Defog to remove Sticky Web.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>With a great defensive typing, respectable bulk, and STAB Foul Play boosted by its ability, Yveltal makes for an excellent defensive wall. Yveltal's immunity to Psychic allows it to check threats such as Deoxys-A, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Foul Play often forces switches due to its power and deals large amounts of damage to threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma. This also prevents them, as well as Zacian-C, from setting up without massive punishment.</li> <li>Toxic allows Yveltal to chip down Pokemon that resist or have the bulk to tank Foul Play, such as Zygarde, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Water, and Ho-Oh. U-turn can be used instead, allowing Yveltal to grab momentum against predicted switch-ins such as Arceus-Dark and Ho-Oh while bringing in wallbreakers such as Zacian-C and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Taunt prevents Primal Kyogre, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde from setting up on Yveltal. Additionally, it prevents Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Water, and Ho-Oh from crippling Yveltal with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp while also preventing them from using Refresh and Recover, reducing their longevity.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Yveltal to outspeed the different support Arceus formes, meaning it can use Taunt to block their Taunt or utility moves. With this, Yveltal also outspeeds Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, allowing it to cripple them with Toxic or prevent setup with Taunt.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Yveltal to block Extreme Speed from Arceus and Low Kick from Marshadow at the cost of losing the ability to absorb Psychic-type attacks from Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Tera Poison allows Yveltal to better check Zacian-C and wall Arceus-Fairy with the help of Taunt, though checking Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma becomes significantly harder.</li> <li>Defensive Yveltal is a great fit on teams looking for Pokemon that can check a large variety of physical threats and threaten them out consistently, such as balance and stall teams.</li> <li>Throughout the game, Yveltal should try to look for opportunities to spread Toxic to the opposing team or provide momentum through U-turn. Yveltal can create these opportunities by threatening out various physical attackers such as Arceus, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Salamence with Foul Play, forcing opponents to make unfavorable moves.</li> <li>Yveltal should be able to safely stay in on most support Arceus formes thanks to Taunt, as well as against Giratina-O and Zygarde.</li> <li>Yveltal can often get overwhelmed by threats such as Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy, so a teammate such as Ho-Oh or Necrozma-DM that can wall these Pokemon greatly helps it.</li> <li>Fast sweepers such as Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Mega Salamence that take advantage of the chip damage Yveltal provides also make great teammates.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dark Pulse is Yveltal's main attacking option. With Dark Aura and a Life Orb, it allows Yveltal to 2HKO many of the tier's defensive options, such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing has solid neutral coverage with Dark Pulse, being able to hit the Fairy-, Fighting-, and Dark-types that would switch into Dark Pulse, such as Arceus-Dark and opposing Yveltal.</li> <li>Taunt shuts down opposing setup, such as Arceus's Swords Dance, entry hazards, such as Primal Groudon's Stealth Rock, and status moves, such as Ho-Oh's Toxic; when combined with Oblivion Wing, it allows Yveltal to win duels against many Pokemon that would otherwise be able to take on Yveltal's attacks, such as support Arceus formes and defensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Knock Off cripples Pokemon, such as Ho-Oh and Chansey, by removing their item, while Sucker Punch allows Yveltal to punish faster Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo Y, making it a solid revenge killer.</li> <li>Tera Dark boosts Dark Pulse's power to ridiculous feats, such as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Eternatus, defensive Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh, as well as boosting Sucker Punch and Knock Off's damage. Tera Flying can also be used to increase Oblivion Wing's power, letting it hit Arceus-Dark and opposing Yveltal harder, which in return gives Yveltal more longevity.</li> <li>Yveltal should be used as an offensive check to Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Necrozma-DM. Switching into resisted moves such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief and Lunala's Moongeist Beam or attacks Yveltal is immune to such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser allows Yveltal to stay healthy throughout a game, which is important, as Yveltal can get worn down from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil. Oblivion Wing is best suited for use when Yveltal is at low HP, as it should mostly be using Dark Pulse for damage otherwise.</li> <li>Although much of the tier is 2HKOed by Yveltal, most of the metagame is able to 2HKO Yveltal as well, even with neutral moves, such as Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon.</li> <li>Yveltal should avoid status as much as possible; Toxic from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O ruins its longevity in longer games, paralysis from Zygarde's Glare and Necrozma-DM's Thunder Wave limits its Speed so it's more likely to be KOed by faster threats, and burns from Ho-Oh and Arceus-Dark weaken the strength of Knock Off and Sucker Punch, the latter being problematic against more offensive teams where priority may be necessary for revenge killing.</li> <li>Yveltal's immediate power allows it to be an early-game wallbreaker for its team, which is good for offensive structures.</li> <li>Specially offensive Yveltal fits best on offensive teams. Primal Groudon is a good partner, as it is able to beat Pokemon like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy that would be hard for Yveltal to break, while Yveltal can break through Giratina-O and Zygarde for Primal Groudon in return; Yveltal is also able to come in on the Ground-type moves that would threaten Primal Groudon, barring Thousand Arrows from Zygarde, while Primal Groudon comes in on the Fairy- and Electric-type moves that threaten Yveltal, such as Zacian-C's Play Rough and Primal Kyogre's Thunder. Ho-Oh can remove Stealth Rock for Yveltal, which improves its longevity. Necrozma-DM is able to handle Fairy- and Ice-types such as Calyrex-I and Arceus-Fairy, and Yveltal can come into the Ghost-, Dark-, and Ground-type moves that Necrozma-DM struggles with, such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief, opposing Yveltal's Dark Pulse, and Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Powerful physical sweepers such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Yveltal removing common physical walls such as Zygarde, Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Dondozo, while they handle the special walls such as Ho-Oh and Chansey in return; Zacian-C in particular can break through opposing Yveltal and Arceus-Dark with Play Rough, letting Yveltal spam Dark Pulse more easily.</li> <li>Hazard hyper offense teams using suicide leads such as Deoxys-S, Smeargle, Shuckle, and Glimmora appreciate Yveltal stopping Defog attempts from Ho-Oh, Giratina, and support Arceus formes with Taunt, as well as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, and Giratina with Knock Off.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Foul Play makes Yveltal an excellent revenge killer against many offensive teams, being able to use the Attack boosts of Pokemon such as Swords Dance Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM against them to break right through them before they have the chance to cause major damage. Dark Pulse is a strong Dark-type STAB move if a more consistent damage output is required to clean late-game.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing allows Yveltal to reliably revenge kill Marshadow and maintain its health somewhat. Roost may be considered to keep itself healthy as well, but locking into it can be risky against many teams.</li> <li>Defog allows Yveltal to be one of the best solutions to hyper offense teams in the tier, clearing entry hazards early-game due to how many switches it forces with Foul Play. Yveltal notably does not have its Speed dropped by Sticky Web. If its team already has a consistent Defogger, Toxic may be chosen to punish support Arceus formes more consistently.</li> <li>U-turn allows Yveltal to better take advantage of Pokemon that switch in like defensive Eternatus, Arceus-Dark, and Arceus-Fairy to maintain momentum for its team.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Yveltal to outspeed fully invested base 95s such as Rayquaza and Kyurem-B and survive a +1 Outrage from Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma, and revenge kill it with either Foul Play or Dark Pulse. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to strengthen Oblivion Wing.</li> <li>Tera Dark allows Yveltal to OHKO +3 Zacian-C with Foul Play and removes its Stealth Rock weakness; however, Tera Steel is also a good option to allow Yveltal to become much more resilient against the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus while also turning its Stealth Rock and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances.</li> <li>Because Yveltal is still quite physically bulky and is able to punish foes even if they boost, it is best to use Yveltal proactively rather than reactively to keep setup sweepers in check by bringing it in on predicted setup moves or to take a hit and fire back with Foul Play.</li> <li>Yveltal fits very well on offensive teams where its short-term utility and late-game cleaning prowess are put on full display, being able to almost singlehandedly shut down entire hyper offense teams that such structures otherwise have trouble against and trade blows with surprise sweepers that may otherwise run away with the game.</li> <li>Alternative Defoggers like Arceus-Ground and Giratina-O are great teammates on such teams, matching up very well against the tier's best Stealth Rock setters and keeping hazards off for Yveltal to stay as healthy as possible throughout a game.</li> <li>Offensive Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon variants are also notable partners, being able to take advantage of the many switches Yveltal forces and the common Fairy-types it will find itself luring in for a safe setup opportunity. This allows Yveltal to clean up later. Furthermore, they are capable of setting up Stealth Rock in order to further facilitate Yveltal late-game, as Yveltal greatly appreciates the prior damage on Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Eternatus to more easily clean up games.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Between the highest physical bulk in the metagame after triggering Power Construct and the need for only one attacking move to hit most of the tier for neutral damage, Zygarde is the best wall in the tier. It is capable of handling multiple top threats in the tier such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Thousand Arrows is a potent Ground-type STAB move that hits airborne foes, leaving only Tera Grass users like defensive Ho-Oh as legitimate switch-ins that can still be played around by Zygarde. Glare allows Zygarde to cripple any foe it can stay in against, rendering them easier to outspeed for itself and its allies, which include offensive Arceus formes and Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Coil enables Zygarde to become a wincon and makes it hard to break past on the physical side. It becomes a bulky sweeper if the other team can't force it out, easily setting up on foes such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Rest provides Zygarde with longevity to not worry as much about being worn down and renders status effects such as Toxic poison from Arceus-Dark and Primal Groudon and burn from the likes of Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Arceus-Dark's Will-O-Wisp as ineffective methods to cripple it in the long run.</li> <li>Terastallizing covers Zygarde's 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, rendering it much harder to KO by foes such as Arceus-Water and the uncommon Calyrex-I. Tera Water Zygarde excels at checking the previously mentioned Pokemon while gaining uncommon weaknesses, turning into a good answer to Pokemon like defensive Primal Kyogre, Zacian-C, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Tera Fairy renders it immune to phazing by Dragon Tail from opposing Zygarde while also becoming a sturdy wall against foes such as Marshadow, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark. Tera Poison keeps Zygarde as a good check to foes such as Marshadow, Arceus-Fairy, and Eternatus, raises Zygarde's longevity by becoming immune to Toxic from support Arceus formes, and lets it absorb Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, supporting its team with entry hazard control.</li> <li>Before Terastallizing, it's best for Zygarde's base typing to be considered in relation to the opposing team. For example, as Zygarde is among the most solid Primal Groudon answers, Terastallizing will worsen its matchup against it; therefore, it often Terastallizes mid- or late-game when Primal Groudon is no longer an issue.</li> <li>Marshadow's Spectral Thief can steal Zygarde's setup boosts, so it's best to avoid trying to set up while Marshadow remains a threat on the other team.</li> <li>As Zygarde wants to trigger Power Construct to considerably raise its stats, it's often a good idea to bring Zygarde in early-game to cripple and wear down foes and let Zygarde itself get worn down into range for its ability to trigger.</li> <li>Zygarde's special bulk can be lacking even as Zygarde-C against foes like Primal Kyogre, Eternatus, and Yveltal if it cannot Terastallize, so it appreciates special walls to complement it such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Taunt from foes such as support Arceus formes, Gothitelle, and Yveltal considerably shut Zygarde down; therefore, it likes wallbreakers to handle them that don't mind Taunt like Zacian-C and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>As Zygarde provides speed control by using Glare as much as possible, wallbreakers such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Marshadow benefit from the crippled Speed of foes that would otherwise outspeed them such as Zacian-C, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Eternatus. In return, these teammates threaten Ho-Oh, which can phaze Zygarde with Whirlwind and shrug off the damage with Regenerator. This makes Zygarde a solid option for bulky offense and more defensive team structures ranging from balance to stall.</li> </ul>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde is among the most threatening setup sweepers available, benefitting from its gargantuan bulk and access to the extremely valuable Thousand Arrows to break through the opposing team. Thousand Arrows hits crucial targets like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus. Grounding airborne targets is fantastic and renders would-be checks like Ho-Oh and Yveltal unable to fulfill their roles properly. Substitute lets Zygarde set up on passive walls like Chansey, Gothitelle, and Giratina reliably. It also eases the activation of Power Construct and blocks status, which is especially useful against Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Primal Groudon's Toxic.</li> <li>Dragon Tail grants a powerful phazing tool to force out what would otherwise be hard checks and counters like Dondozo, defensive Tera Grass Ho-Oh, and Coil Zygarde. Against Ho-Oh in particular, Zygarde outruns it once boosted and can use Dragon Tail before it uses Whirlwind. Glare ruins aggressive switches from Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Dark, and Marshadow that would attempt to offensively check it.</li> <li>Leftovers grants Zygarde appreciated recovery, which is especially useful against passive foes such as defensive Ho-Oh, Chansey, and Blissey that fail to break its Substitute. Zygarde can also opt for Groundium Z to turn Thousand Arrows into Tectonic Rage, which lets it OHKO foes like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Ultra Necrozma at +1. At +2, it can even OHKO foes like defensive Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ground after some chip damage. Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Dragon Tail allows Zygarde to get a surprise OHKO at +1 on Mega Salamence, as well as opposing defensive Zygarde after some chip damage, which would otherwise try to set up on it. Thanks to Devastating Drake having neutral priority, unlike Dragon Tail, Zygarde can easily eliminate Ditto and phazers like Giratina and opposing Dragon Tail Zygarde.</li> <li>Investing 12 EVs in HP maximizes Leftovers recovery. Alongside 48 EVs in Special Defense, it allows Zygarde to survive one Ice Beam from defensive Arceus formes. The even HP spread also allows Zygarde to activate Power Construct after only two Substitutes if using a Z-Crystal. Investing 232 EVs in Speed lets Zygarde outrun Eternatus at +1 after Power Construct.</li> <li>Tera Ground is the premier Tera type when running Leftovers, further boosting Thousand Arrows and allowing it to almost always OHKO Marshadow at +1 while 2HKOing fast support Arceus-Ground. It also turns Zygarde's 4x weakness to Ice into a 2x weakness, which is especially relevant against defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Zygarde can also opt for a defensive Tera type. With Tera Fairy, it becomes immune to Dragon, blocking any attempt at phazing it from the likes of Giratina and opposing Dragon Tail Zygarde. Tera Water can be used to turn the tables against defensive Primal Kyogre thanks to granting Zygarde a resistance to both Scald and Ice Beam. Removing its weakness to Fairy also allows Zygarde to set up one more time against the likes of Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy and retaliate harder with a boosted Thousand Arrows.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde is a good choice on bulky offense teams looking for a good way to disrupt and clean the opposing team once it has been chipped down.</li> <li>It's preferable to keep this Zygarde set unrevealed before attempting to set up. In particular, this set works best if the opponent is forced to Terastallize a non-Tera Fairy Pokemon, like Tera Grass Ho-Oh, so Zygarde can spam Dragon Tail with ease.</li> <li>Another good strategy is to reveal Substitute early to activate Power Construct and then attempt to sweep later in the game once Zygarde has been made much more bulky thanks to its ability.</li> <li>Due to the fact that this set trades off its defensive aspect for more offensive power, a good defensive core is often required to address setup sweepers before Zygarde can find an opportunity to set up itself. Primal Kyogre, defensive Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Dark all help to deal with common setup sweepers like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Wallbreakers like Choice Band Marshadow, special Ultra Necrozma, and Rayquaza can help chip away at Tera Fairy physical walls like Roar Giratina, defensive Zygarde-C, and Dondozo that this set cannot break nor phaze once they have Terastallized.</li> </ul>"

In the event that Zygarde can't set up, it can still pivot to a teammate after trapping its foe.</li> <li>Dragon Dance and Coil boost Zygarde's mediocre Attack to threatening levels. The former's Speed boost lets it avoid having to run Scale Shot, while the latter's Defense boost gives Zygarde an easier time setting up on Attack-boosting foes, such as Zacian-C and Arceus.</li> <li>Thousand Arrows should be used with Dragon Dance, providing Zygarde with the means to hit foes immune to Ground like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Scale Shot should be used with Coil, hitting the aforementioned foes while boosting Zygarde's Speed, with Coil reversing Scale Shot's Defense-lowering effect.</li> <li>80 HP EVs let Zygarde always survive defensive Arceus-Water's Ice Beam, letting it safely activate Power Construct against it, while 204 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature let Zygarde always OHKO defensive Ho-Oh at +6 Attack. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to make Zygarde as physically bulky as possible, helping it take attacks from foes such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon. If Zygarde isn't running Thousand Arrows, a spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 80 SpD / 132 Spe with a Careful nature lets Zygarde avoid a 2HKO from Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike and an OHKO from Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock while letting Zygarde-C always outspeed Choice Scarf Yveltal at +2.</li> <li>Terastallization is extremely potent on Zygarde, letting it set up on foes it otherwise couldn't by replacing its exploitable weaknesses to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy. Tera Water notably gives Zygarde a resistance to Water and Ice, letting it set up on Primal Kyogre and non-Taunt Arceus-Water. Tera Poison turns Zygarde's Fairy weakness into a resistance, letting it set up on Zacian-C.</li> <li>A large part of this Zygarde's effectiveness is a result of its surprise factor, luring in checks such as non-Taunt Arceus formes and turning them into setup fodder. Zygarde is often reliant on Terastallization to accomplish this, so players should carefully consider the need to Terastallize their other Pokemon if they wish to preserve Zygarde's sweeping potential.</li> <li>Players should typically try getting Zygarde to below 50% HP to activate Power Construct. This can be achieved by letting a trapped foe weaken Zygarde, or by letting it get worn down by residual damage and stray hits. However, Zygarde's HP should be carefully managed, given that Rest only has 8 PP and renders Zygarde passive during its sleep turns.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, utility Arceus formes, and Eternatus can weaken the opposing team, letting Zygarde-C OHKO foes such as defensive Arceus formes with Thousand Waves.</li> <li>Wallbreakers such as Primal Kyogre and Necrozma-DM can soften up foes such as opposing Zygarde and Arceus formes, letting it sweep more easily.</li> </ul>"

Earth Power is an alternative to OHKO Glimmora and situationally hit common switch-ins in Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Mega Diancie avoid an OHKO from Choice Band Tera Flying Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and Choice Band Marshadow's Low Kick after Stealth Rock as well as a 2HKO from Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse while ensuring that it outspeeds neutral-natured foes with base 120 Speed, such as Palkia-O and Mega Salamence, on top of OHKOing specially offensive Yveltal with Moonblast.</li> <li>Especially against non-hyper offense teams, if at Team Preview it's clear that Mega Diancie's relative lack of Speed and frail nature for the metagame may render it outsped and OHKOed, it should be kept for the mid-game, where it can come into foes such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O to force a switch while setting at least one entry hazard.</li> <li>Mega Diancie has significantly higher bulk before Mega Evolving, so it may be desirable to Mega Evolve it later on to withstand an attack such as unboosted Mega Salamence's Earthquake or defensive Arceus-Ground's Judgment. In very niche scenarios where Sticky Web manages to get into its side of the field, preserving Diancie's Mega Evolution to keep Clear Body for the mid-game can help preserve Diancie's Speed. Clear Body can also be used to avoid being hindered by Glimmora's Mud Shot, but this also can let Glimmora lay entry hazards instead in the event of an incorrect prediction.</li> <li>Faster foes such as Zacian-C, offensive Arceus-Water, and Deoxys-A can prevent Mega Diancie from doing anything by immediately OHKOing it.

Sunsteel Strike targets Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy, and it's especially powerful when it has STAB pre-Ultra Burst. Outrage is an alternative, offering Ultra Necrozma a powerful STAB attack that can hit Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark for huge damage, but leaving Necrozma locked into the move makes it a niche option.</li> <li>Light That Burns the Sky provides +1 Ultra Necrozma with the means to OHKO foes such as offensive Arceus formes and defensive Ho-Oh, though Necrozma-DM cannot use it before or on the turn it Ultra Bursts.</li> <li>140 Speed EVs allow Ultra Necrozma to outspeed Chi-Yu unboosted and Choice Scarf Yveltal at +1. 24 HP and 92 Defense EVs allow Ultra Necrozma to avoid an OHKO from Arceus's Extreme Speed after Spikes, Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak after switching into Stealth Rock as Necrozma-DM, and avoid being 2HKOed by uninvested Arceus forme's Earth Power as Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>224 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Ultra Necrozma to outspeed Marshadow and Arceus formes unboosted, but the loss in bulk makes Ultra Necrozma likely to fall after Stealth Rock to a +2 Arceus's Extreme Speed and Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>An alternate spread of 16 HP / 192 Atk / 168 Def / 132 Spe with an Adamant nature allows as Ultra Necrozma to outspeed Yveltal, avoid a OHKO from specially offensive Yveltal's Sucker Punch, and OHKOes defensive Zygarde with +1 Light that Burns the Sky after a layer of Spikes and Leftovers recovery.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM best fits on offense teams looking for an exceptionally powerful sweeper that can set up on common offensive threats like Zacian-C.</li> <li>Choosing when to Ultra Burst is essential to letting Necrozma-DM sweep. Doing so provides Ultra Necrozma with the ability to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and many boosted threats when at +1, such as the likes of Zacian-C and +2 Rock Polish Primal-Groudon, foes a +1 Necrozma-DM fails to outspeed. However, Necrozma-DM's defensive profile becomes considerably worse when it Ultra Bursts, losing bulk, Prism Armor, and many of its resistances, notably exchanging its resistances to Fairy and Ice for weaknesses. However, the loss of its weaknesses to Fire and Ground, notably gaining a resistance to the former, does help Necrozma-DM better take on foes such as Primal Groudon. Gaining a resistance to Water also allows Ultra Necrozma to have an easier time handling Primal Kyogre. Additionally, the increase in Necrozma-DM's power, notably against foes weak to its moves thanks to Neuroforce, and access to Light That Burns the Sky make Ultra Necrozma a more potent wallbreaker.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM enjoys support from entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S, which can wear down foes such as Arceus-Dark and Primal Groudon. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl are notably helpful for allowing Necrozma-DM to set up very easily on common attackers like Zacian-C and Eternatus.</li> <li>Fellow wallbreaking and sweeping teammates such as Zacian-C and Arceus can help break holes in the opposing team for Necrozma-DM by eliminating or weakening foes such as Arceus-Dark and Ho-Oh, or they can sweep using the holes it creates breaking through bulky foes such as Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes.</li> </ul>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a ferocious wallbreaker and cleaner that finds a home on bulky offense and balance teams. Necrozma-DM is able to leverage its bulk, typing, ability, and the possbility of bluffing the threat of Ultra Necrozma to force a switch or absorb an incoming attack such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades or Arceus-Dark's Foul Play and then use Dragon Dance.</li> <li>If Ho-Oh is sufficiently covered, Stone Edge can be substituted for Photon Geyser. This move still hits Ho-Oh hard while enabling Necrozma-DM to beat Dondozo, which would otherwise wall it. It has the added benefit of OHKOing Eternatus without the need to spend a turn stat boosting.</li> <li>Solganium Z allows Necrozma-DM to OHKO common switch-ins such as Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Zygarde with +1 Searing Sunraze Smash mid-game, clearing the way for its teammates.</li> <li>The extra bulk provided by 132 HP EVs allows Necrozma-DM to avoid OHKOs from some hits it otherwise wouldn't while still hitting important Speed benchmarks. For example, Necrozma-DM will survive Life Orb Marshadow's Poltergeist after Stealth Rock, defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a single layer of Spikes, and defensive Primal Kyogre's +1 Scald. With 124 Speed EVs, Necrozma-DM has the ability to outspeed uninvested base 90s with a neutral nature such as defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. At +1 Necrozma-DM outspeeds fully invested Yveltal. At +2 Necrozma-DM outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, only fearing priority moves such as Marshadow's Shadow Sneak or Yveltal's Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Alternatively, investing in 236 Speed EVs allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed fully invested base 120s at +1 such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence. If Necrozma-DM uses Dragon Dance on the switch-in, it retains the ability to OHKO Mega Salamence with Searing Sunraze Smash with minimal chip after Intimidate removes Necrozma-DM's Attack boost.</li> <li>Due to a lack of recovery, Necrozma-DM needs to be cognisant of its HP, as any chip is permanent. Necrozma-DM frequently absorbs large hits while setting up or revenge killing certain threats, and taking chip may render it unable to do so. For example, Necrozma-DM always survives defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a layer of Spikes but can be OHKOed if Stealth Rock is also on the field.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM should not be used to fulfill the defensive duties typically associated with Necrozma-DM such as switching into an unscouted Zacian-C, though it can revenge kill them. It excels when used as a secondary check to them, with teammates such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon serving as primary checks.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM struggles heavily against offensive Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and physical Arceus-Ground. Offensive Primal Groudon is able to OHKO Necrozma-DM with its STAB moves. Marshadow is always able to revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Shadow Sneak and OHKO it with Poltergeist. Physical Arceus-Ground OHKOes Necrozma-DM with Tectonic Rage and can threaten to sweep if given the opportunity to use Dragon Dance. Zygarde is an excellent teammate on balance teams that can switch into all three of these Pokemon and provides valuable paralysis support, which allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Giratina-O is a good teammate on bulky offense teams that can switch into Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground. Necrozma-DM also appreciates the Defog and status support provided by Giratina-O.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy provides a Dark switch-in on balance teams, which helps mitigate the downside of misfiring Searing Sunraze Smash into the wrong target. It is a good check to Life Orb Yveltal, which is otherwise very threatening to balance teams and can revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Sucker Punch. Arceus-Fairy can also provide Stealth Rock and status support in the form of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic to chip opposing Pokemon into range of Necrozma-DM's attacks such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

Earthquake hits foes that Necrozma-DM checks harder, like Zacian-C, Eternatus, and opposing Necrozma-DM, but it makes Necrozma-DM weaker in general and especially to foes that are immune to the move, such as Yveltal, Giratina-O, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Toxic allows Necrozma-DM to cripple checks such as Primal Groudon, offensive Arceus-Ground, Giratina-O, and Ho-Oh. Thunder Wave is an alternative to cripple Pokemon that it checks such as Eternatus, Deoxys-A, and support Arceus formes lacking Refresh and provide speed control for its allies.</li> <li>Knock Off allows Necrozma-DM to cripple foes by removing their item; in particular, it punishes Ho-Oh switching in to remove entry hazards.</li> <li>As Necrozma-DM has multiple ways to punish hazard removal attempts from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, it is a solid Stealth Rock setter.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Zacian-C's Close Combat after Intrepid Sword, Life Orb Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock, and defensive Arceus-Ground's Judgment.</li> <li>Leftovers increases Necrozma-DM's longevity, notably cancelling out chip damage from Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that prevents Zacian-C from trying to overwhelm Necrozma-DM's Morning Sun PP by wearing it down.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is a Pokemon that does not Terastallize often, as its innate typing already lets it handle a good portion of the metagame. After Terastallizing, Necrozma-DM becomes unable to properly check foes it's meant to cover, and its allies often make better use of the mechanic. Tera Poison lets Necrozma-DM check Zacian-C more consistently even if it Terastallizesand absorb Toxic Spikes from Eternatus. Tera Water alternatively allows Necrozma-DM to remove its regular type weaknesses and gain Fire and Water resistances, allowing it to come into Arceus-Ground, Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon in a pinch.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM can be used early-game to wall foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Zacian-C, and Eternatus and then either cripple them or set Stealth Rock, but it shouldn't be heavily relied on, as it can get worn down and be left unable to check them consistently.</li> <li>As it's used to handle several metagame threats such as Zacian-C and Deoxys-A, Necrozma-DM can get easily overwhelmed; therefore, it appreciates allies that can be secondary checks to such foes like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Multiple foes such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Marshadow can threaten Necrozma-DM, so it appreciates allies to check them, with defensive examples including Arceus-Fairy and Zygarde and offensive ones including Palkia-O, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Ground; Necrozma-DM, in return, checks foes that would force them out such as Eternatus and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Being crippled by burn, paralysis, or Knock Off from foes such as Ho-Oh, Zygarde, and Ferrothorn can compromise Necrozma-DM's consistency at checking foes; therefore, it makes a good defensive core with support Arceus formes with Refresh and Primal Groudon.</li> </ul>"

Alternatively, Poltergeist can be used for its higher Base Power; this comes in handy with Tera Ghost, as it can OHKO defensive Primal Kyogre at +1 after Stealth Rock damage for example.</li> <li>Low Kick perfectly complements Marshadow's Ghost-type attacks and forms a nearly unresisted STAB combination. Due to the heavy weight of Pokemon in Ubers, Low Kick is preferred to Close Combat because it has no drawbacks while still having 120 Base Power against common targets like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Arceus, and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak is a powerful tool that can eliminate Speed-boosted and naturally faster targets such as Deoxys-A, as well as weakened Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Tera Ghost is the premier choice because it further amplifies Marshadow's damage output. In particular, it allows Poltergeist to OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM at +1, OHKO Dragon Dance Zygarde at +1 and—after Stealth Rock damage—almost always 2HKO defensive Arceus-Fairy when unboosted. Turning into a pure Ghost-type also comes in handy in order to tank one hit from the likes of Arceus-Fairy and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Life Orb is the best item in order to maximize the damage Marshadow can deal. Spell Tag can also be used, granting its Ghost-type attacks a 20% damage boost with no drawbacks. The drop in power is significant, however; for example, Spell Tag Marshadow is not guaranteed to 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon at +1 with Poltergeist.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is generally recommended in order to ensure that Marshadow always outspeeds Arceus formes as well as Mega Salamence.

Moreover, Pressure enables Eternatus to PP stall moves like Water Spout from Primal Kyogre, Judgment from Arceus-Fairy, Sacred Fire and Defog from Ho-Oh, and Dynamax Cannon from opposing Eternatus. Finally, its capability to spread status adds another layer of utility, making Eternatus a premier choice for balanced team compositions.</li> <li>Toxic Spikes in conjunction with Pressure gives Eternatus a distinct advantage in breaking opposing teams, thanks to its ability to set entry hazards and PP stall Defog from prevalent Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Toxic serves as a potent tool for gradually wearing down Pokemon such as Calm Mind Primal Kyogre without Rest, Yveltal, and Arceus. Additionally, it ensures gradual damage against defensive Arceus formes lacking Refresh, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb finds its primary utility in targeting Arceus-Fairy. Additionally, it offers the potential to poison Pokemon that are immune to Toxic Spikes, notably Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, which would otherwise clear entry hazards against Eternatus.</li> <li>Flamethrower acts as a countermeasure against Steel-types, such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, that would attempt to take advantage of Eternatus, since they are immune to being poisoned. Alternatively, Mystical Fire serves a similar purpose by punishing Steel-types while also limiting Calm Mind Arceus formes. However, it's important to note that Mystical Fire's damage output is weaker than Flamethrower, and as a result, Mystical Fire fails to secure a 2HKO against Zacian-C after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is also favored as a tool against Necrozma-DM, since it has the potential to inflict a burn, rendering Mystical Fire less effective.</li> <li>Combining Toxic with Toxic Spikes forms another viable strategy that affects all prevalent Defoggers immune to Toxic Spikes, making it easier to maintain entry hazards throughout the match. However, relying solely on these moves without coverage options can leave Eternatus vulnerable against Steel-types like Necrozma DM, Magearna, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Leftovers is the preferred item to help Eternatus handle burns from Ho-Oh and mitigate the damage from attacks such as Ice Beam from Primal Kyogre and most attacks from Marshadow. Heavy-Duty Boots serves as a good alternative to avoid entry hazard damage, particularly if the team lacks Defoggers.</li> <li>Eternatus's EV spread enables it to outspeed a fully invested Yveltal while not being 2HKOed by specially offensive Yveltal's Dark Pulse and Choice Band Marshadow's Spectral Thief. An EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpD / 176 Spe with a Timid nature makes it possible for Eternatus to outspeed fully invested Arceus formes while still not be 2HKOed by specially offensive Yveltal's Dark Pulse at the cost of physical bulk. An alternative spread of 40 HP / 252 Def / 216 Spe, which is faster than Marshadow, can deal with physical threats such as Ho-Oh, Marshadow, and Arceus. However, another dedicated wall is necessary to check specially offensive threats like Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Tera Fairy enhances Eternatus's capability against Palkia-O, Life Orb Yveltal, Giratina-O, and Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, while Tera Water improves Eternatus's matchup against Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Eternatus should freely switch into Yveltal and Ho-Oh lacking Thunder Wave and aim to set up Toxic Spikes to threaten Primal Groudon and defensive Arceus formes. It's best to reserve Terastallization as a last resort, since it compromises Eternatus's valuable Toxic immunity.</li> <li>Ho-Oh synergizes well with Eternatus, especially in the presence of Toxic Spikes, as it can phaze foes with Whirlwind and provides an immunity to Ground. Arceus-Dark is another good partner since it can deal with Necrozma-DM, which is immune to Toxic, and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is another excellent choice as a teammate, offering the ability to safely switch in against Primal Groudon and Marshadow. Additionally, a specially defensive Zygarde-C can utilize Glare against opposing Eternatus, ensuring that it maintains the speed advantage. Giratina is another valuable teammate that is capable of dealing with Primal Groudon. It also has Pressure, which significantly enhances the PP stall strategy when paired with Eternatus.</li> <li>When utilizing physically defensive Eternatus, it's crucial to include another Primal Kyogre check on the team, such as Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, or Chansey. Ferrothorn can offer valuable entry hazard support by setting up Spikes and Stealth Rock, and it appreciates Eternatus switching in to handle Ho-Oh. Additionally, Chansey can effectively handle most special attackers and use Heal Bell to cure eventual paralysis on Eternatus, further increasing Eternatus's longevity throughout the match.</li> </ul>"

      "Meteor Beam": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Meteor Beam Eternatus is a very potent threat that fully exploits its offensive potential while keeping some of its good defensive traits thanks to its Poison typing, which allows it to come in and absorb Toxic Spikes and Toxic.</li> <li>Not only does Meteor Beam boost Eternatus's already good Special Attack, it also lures in and removes Ho-Oh while dealing great damage to targets such as Yveltal, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon is the premier STAB move of choice for Eternatus, and it's preferred over Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse because despite its low PP, it has high Base Power and no drawbacks, and it also keeps key KOs. For example, after a Meteor Beam boost, Eternatus can 2HKO specially defensive Primal Groudon with Dynamax Cannon as well as 2HKO Primal Kyogre with the move after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is important to remove Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy, which can otherwise easily survive what Eternatus throws at them and use it as setup fodder. Spreading poison with this move is also useful to hinder some of its soft checks, like Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh. Recover can be used instead to raise Eternatus's longevity and have an easier matchup against balance teams.</li> <li>Flamethrower covers Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, which takes pitiful damage from Dynamax Cannon and Meteor Beam and can force Eternatus out by setting up with Dragon Dance or crippling it with Thunder Wave. Fire Blast can be used for its higher Base Power in order to take out defensive Necrozma-DM as well as Zacian-C at +1.</li> <li>A Timid nature is crucial in order to outrun unboosted Ultra Necrozma and certain threats like Arceus, Mega Salamence, and Marshadow. It also Speed ties with opposing offensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Dragon further increases Dynamax Cannon's damage output, allowing Eternatus to menace key threats. For example, +1 Tera Dragon Dynamax Cannon can 2HKO Tera Water Zygarde-C and can OHKO it prior to Power Construct after a layer of Spikes. It also 2HKOes Ho-Oh and OHKOes Marshadow, and it additionally OHKOes defensive Arceus-Ground after a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Tera Dragon also suppresses Eternatus's weaknesses associated with its Poison typing, letting Eternatus survive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades, Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser, and Arceus-Ground's Judgment.</li> <li>Tera Fire turns the tables against Zacian-C, allowing Eternatus to not only survive any hits from it but also OHKO Zacian-C with Fire Blast without a boost. Tera Fire Eternatus can also benefit from its new resistance to Fairy-type attacks to serve as a check in a pinch to other Fairy-types like Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Meteor Beam Eternatus fits best on offensive teams that are looking for a mid- to late-game wallbreaker and cleaner with sufficient Speed to outrun common threats to offensive teams like unboosted Ultra Necrozma and Xerneas. Cleaners like Double Dance Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus as well as wallbreakers like offensive Calm Mind Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma appreciate the support of Eternatus chipping their shared checks like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Sticky Web support from teammates like Smeargle, Shuckle, and Ribombee further increases Eternatus's ability to threaten common anti-offense Pokemon like Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma, allowing it to outrun and remove them.</li> </ul>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With a Speed tier that outpaces most of the metagame and the capability to often come in against common foes such as Ho-Oh and utility Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dark and apply considerable offensive pressure, Eternatus is a potent wallbreaker that can overwhelm defensive cores commonly found in balance teams, KOing foes across multiple moments of a battle for the bulky offense and balance teams it's usually found on.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon 2HKOes foes such as defensive Ho-Oh after minimal chip damage, defensive Primal Groudon, and defensive Yveltal; it also provides a consistent way to deal damage to foes attempting to scout Eternatus with switches.</li> <li>Draco Meteor OHKOes defensive Zygarde-C, Eruption Primal Groudon, and 2HKOes support Arcues formes while also giving Eternatus the option to overwhelm checks such as Ho-Oh thanks to its sheer power, making it difficult for them to heal off the damage and scout it. Sludge Bomb allows Eternatus to OHKO Arceus-Fairy after Stealth Rock, and it can cripple checks such as Ho-Oh with its poison chance. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes capitalizes on the offensive pressure Eternatus exerts on Pokemon such as Arceus-Dark and defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Fire Blast allows Eternatus to handle Steel-types, as it always 2HKOes defensive Necrozma-DM while OHKOing Zacian-C and the more niche Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Tera Dragon Draco Meteor OHKOes defensive Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo Y, defensive Yveltal, and, after Stealth Rock, Extreme Killer Arceus and utility Arceus formes. Tera Dragon Dynamax Cannon also achieves results such as 2HKOing defensive Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Kyogre while retaining offensive pressure unlike Draco Meteor. Terastallizing prevents Eternatus from absorbing Toxic Spikes and makes it vulnerable to Toxic from Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Dark, so it's best to be used when it's to ensure an OHKO to enable its team for a sweep later on.</li> <li>Eternatus's innate bulk enables it to come in early-game against foes such as Arceus-Dark and defensive Ho-Oh and make progress offensively. If running Toxic Spikes, Eternatus can a defensive set and can net a surprise KO against foes such as Yveltal, Primal Groudon, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>While Fire Blast mitigates this issue, Eternatus can struggle with Steel-types such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, so allies that can check them such as defensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground are good options.</li> <li>Faster foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A can revenge kill Eternatus. Offensive partners such as Marshadow and Arceus can make formidable offensive cores that check them with priority moves, while Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, and Ho-Oh can withstand hits for Eternatus.</li> <li>As it forces a lot of switches, Eternatus appreciates entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Ferrothorn, and Necrozma-DM to deal a lot of chip damage as the match progresses.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Chi-Yu's solid offensive stats combined with Beads of Ruin make it a powerful wallbreaker in the tier, with its unresisted STAB combination threatening out key Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Lunala. However, Chi-Yu's mediocre Speed tier means it is easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Marshadow and Palkia-O, especially since it is quite frail, meaning it needs team support to position itself safely, so Sticky Web structures are needed for it to thrive.</li> <li>Fire Blast allows Chi-Yu to OHKO offensive Necrozma-DM and 2HKO Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground unboosted while also OHKOing Extreme Killer Arceus after a Nasty Plot boost. Flamethrower has less power but improved accuracy.</li> <li>Black Hole Eclipse enables Chi-Yu to OHKO Double Dance Primal Groudon, Palkia-O, and Mega Salamence unboosted while also allowing Chi-Yu to OHKO Ho-Oh, defensive Primal Kyogre, Zacian-C, and defensive Eternatus after a boost, greatly benefitting it in wallbreaking opposing balance teams.</li> <li>Taunt allows Chi-Yu to stop status conditions such as Toxic poison and paralysis from Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, letting it wallbreak more comfortably. Overheat lets Chi-Yu break through Chansey after hitting it with boosted Black Hole Eclipse, as well as giving Chi-Yu a greater offensive presence outside of Nasty Plot, letting it OHKO Marshadow and defensive Necrozma-DM after a layer of spikes, although the latter is not guaranteed.</li> <li>A Timid nature is typically preferred to always outspeed unboosted Yveltal, support Arceus formes, Rayquaza, and Lunala, but Modest can be used for the extra damage, letting Chi-Yu more reliably OHKO Zygarde and Arceus-Fairy with boosted Dark Pulse and Fire Blast, respectively. Modest is significantly worse against more offensive team structures; however, as if Sticky Web support is removed Chi-Yu can no longer outspeed support Arceus formes and Lunala.</li> <li>Chi-Yu is a very strong attacker, so a lot of the time its presence alone can threaten out Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, enabling either free damage or a Nasty Plot boost. Chi-Yu should be careful with its Z-Move, since it's ideally used to target Pokemon such as Ho-Oh or defensive Eternatus, rather than using it wastefully against Pokemon such as Marshadow or Mega Mewtwo Y. In a situation where Chi-Yu cannot use Nasty Plot reliably, using Black Hole Eclipse unboosted is still quite powerful, as the chip damage alone is enough in some situations where a teammate can clean up walls like Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Chi-Yu works best on hyper offense structures that revolve around Sticky Web, meaning setters such as Shuckle and Smeargle are greatly appreciated; the latter also comes with the benefit of removing entry hazards with Mortal Spin for Chi-Yu, since it cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, while they both can set additional hazards such as Stealth Rock or Spikes which help Chi-Yu reach important damage thresholds.</li> <li>Teammates that can threaten out specially defensive walls such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Arceus-Fairy are greatly appreciated by Chi-Yu since it can wallbreak easier, so teammates such as offensive Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow are good for this; these Pokemon also appreciate Chi-Yu breaking through physical walls like opposing Primal Groudon, Zygarde, and support Arceus formes.</li> </ul>"
