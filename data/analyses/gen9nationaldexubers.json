        "description": "<ul> <li>With its unique typing and ability in Thick Fat upon Mega Evolving, Mega Venusaur carves a small niche as a check to Primal Kyogre, defensive Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, Arceus-Water, and Zygarde for balance teams. However, due to its passivity, it struggles greatly against offensive team structures, and its lack of an item means it faces heavy competition with Ferrothorn, Eternatus, and Arceus-Grass.</li> <li>Leech Seed provides a reliable way of wearing down Pokemon that view Mega Venusaur as setup fodder, such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Eternatus, while providing passive recovery to teammates such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Toxic enhances this chip damage further, preventing support Arceus formes and defensive Yveltal from shrugging off the damage with recovery, allowing Mega Venusaur to be a nuisance for many bulkier teams to deal with.</li> <li>Grass Knot is a solid method of dealing damage across a game, especially against Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Zygarde, the former risking a 2HKO after Stealth Rock and Leech Seed damage.</li> <li>The following EV spread allows Mega Venusaur to avoid the 2HKO from +2 Thousand Arrows from defensive Zygarde and Life Orb Marshadow's Spectral Thief while always being able to 2HKO Tera Water Zygarde-C with Grass Knot. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense to handle special attackers such as Primal Kyogre, Eternatus, Arceus-Fairy and Palkia-O better. The alternative EV spread maximizes Mega Venusaur's physical bulk, avoiding the 2HKO from Arceus-Ground's Earth Plate-boosted Earthquake while still avoiding the 2HKO from Timid Palkia-O's Spacial Rend.</li> <li>Due to Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat ability, its ideal to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as base Venusaur struggles to switch into Ice Beam from Primal Kyogre and has less bulk overall. It's also ideal to keep Mega Venusaur as healthy as possible, since its easily worn down by entry hazards and repeated attacks, especially since Synthesis heals less under rain.</li> <li>Prior to Mega Evolution, Chlorophyll can be used to revenge kill offensive Primal Groudon sets if necessary. It should be noted that Synthesis also heals more under Desolate Land, so Mega Venusaur can serve as a temporary Primal Groudon check, especially if the latter is worn down significantly.</li> <li>Leech Seed should be used on the switch, rather than during a one-on-one matchup, as it makes Mega Venusaur more passive; it should be used quite frequently as well, especially mid-game to wear down Pokemon that cannot reliably heal such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, and Zygarde.</li> <li>Due to Mega Venusaur being unable to damage Steel-types such as Zacian-C, Fire-types such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are greatly appreciated to offensively and defensively check them; these Fire-types also appreciate Mega Venusaur handling Arceus-Water and Primal Kyogre. Offensive Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma can easily set up and knock out Mega Venusaur, so Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark are liked too. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza threaten Mega Venusaur, so Steel-types like defensive Necrozma-DM are good partners.</li> <li>The chip damage caused by Mega Venusaur's Leech Seed and Toxic allows strong attackers such as Marshadow, Palkia-O, Yveltal, and Deoxys-A to clean up enemy teams much more easily. Mega Venusaur also appreciates hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes from Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM to help whittle down foes with Leech Seed and Toxic; it also appreciates hazard removal from teammates such as Ho-Oh or Giratina-O, the latter needing Mega Venusaur to check Arceus-Fairy for it.</li> </ul>"

In addition, it removes sleep from allies such as Dondozo and Giratina that rely on Rest for recovery.</li> <li>Confide allows Chansey more easily wall Primal Kyogre, non-Taunt Arceus-Fairy, and Eternatus by nullifying any Calm Mind or Meteor Beam setup attempts, although Chansey should be aware of its PP lest these threats have an opportunity to set up later.</li> <li>Seismic Toss is another option that allows Chansey to break Palkia-O’s Substitute and to do damage to Taunt Arceus formes. Toxic allows Chansey to slowly wear down the Pokemon it walls such as wallbreaker Primal Kyogre and non-Taunt Arceus-Fairy while punishing typical switch-ins such as Primal Groudon, specially offensive Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Arceus-Ground. However, using Toxic means Chansey is completely shut down by Taunt, and it is easier for defensive Primal Kyogre and Substitute Palkia-O to deal with.</li> <li>Minimal Speed allows Chansey to underspeed Alomomola's Flip Turn, allowing Chansey to hinder the foe Alomomola would otherwise safely bring in, and to Speed tie Calyrex-I under Trick Room. The EV spread maximizes mixed bulk to let Chansey act as a special wall while also withstanding weak physical attacks such as Yveltal's U-turn and Giratina-O's Dragon Tail.</li> <li>Tera Grass allows Chansey to wall wallbreaker Primal Kyogre by tanking Water Spout more comfortably, in addition to minimizing the damage defensive Primal Kyogre can do to it.</li> <li>Chansey should not be afraid to switch into special threats such as Primal Kyogre, Meteor Beam Eternatus, and Palkia-O. However, it must be wary of its HP or it will easily be overwhelmed by threats such as Water Spout Kyogre and +1 Deoxys-A under Psychic Terrain. After sustaining damage, Soft-Boiled should be used on free turns such as when Chansey forces out wallbreaker Primal Kyogre and Palkia-O. However, it must be aware of Soft-Boiled's PP or else it will compromise its ability to check these threats. Chansey also serves as an excellent switch-in to status spreaders such as Giratina-O and defensive Ho-Oh thanks to Natural Cure.</li> <li>Chansey is very vulnerable to physical attacks and can easily be set up on by threats such as Taunt Arceus-Ground and Facade Mega Salamence, so checks to these such as Arceus-Dark and Dondozo make excellent teammates. The two of them can collectively check these threats as well as Pokemon such as Arceus, Zacian-C, and Zygarde.</li> <li>Chansey is quickly shut down by threats such as Taunt Yveltal and Arceus-Fairy, so teammates that can check them such as Eternatus and Ho-Oh are valuable.</li> </ul>"

Its ability to generate endless PP also helps against stall teams.</li> <li>In the rare case there is a Ditto mirror, the EVs, IVs, and nature maximize the chance that the opposing Ditto’s Imposter ability activates first, thus causing it to run out of PP first.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Ditto to block Extreme Speed from Arceus, since it cannot OHKO Arceus with Extreme Speed or Tera Ghost Arceus with Shadow Claw at +2 from full, while Arceus can at the expense of Tera Normal thanks to Ditto’s low HP stat.</li> <li>Tera Fairy provides a resistance to Sucker Punch and Foul Play, making it harder for Yveltal and Arceus-Dark to revenge kill Ditto. Tera Fairy also provides a useful immunity to Dragon-type moves, letting Ditto soft check Eternatus and Palkia-O.</li> <li>Tera Dark also resists Sucker Punch and Foul Play while also providing a resistance to Marshadow’s Shadow Sneak. Thanks to Tera Dark’s immunity to Psychic, it allows Ditto to absorb powerful attacks such as +1 Light that Burns the Sky from Ultra Necrozma and Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice allows Ditto to hit Zygarde and Mega Salamence with a super effective move in the rare case Ditto copies a Marshadow with Hidden Power.</li> <li>Ditto should be swapped in carefully, as any unnecessary damage can compromise its role. Due to its low HP stat, Ditto struggles defensively even when transforming into walls such as Chansey.</li> <li>Ditto greatly helps in the hyper offense matchup by restricting the opponent from setting up in addition to Imposter taking away Sticky Web's Speed drop, keeping teammates such as Eternatus, Ho-Oh and Yveltal from being overwhelmed by boosting threats such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Ditto can be used to greatly help in the stall matchup thanks to its ability to generate endless PP. Ditto stays healthy by copying recovery moves from Chansey, Dondozo, and Arceus-Dark. Ditto also increases its longevity by copying abilities such as Natural Cure from Chansey and Regenerator from Ho-Oh, and Alomomola.</li> <li>Ditto is a good fit on balance teams, as it helps Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal from being overwhelmed by hyper offense threats such as Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma. In return, Ho-Oh and Yveltal keep entry hazards off the field, since Ditto can easily get worn down by them.</li> <li>Teammates such as Primal Groudon and Zygarde are free to use more offensive sets thanks to Ditto being able to check threats such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and opposing Primal Groudon for them. In addition, Zygarde appreciates Ditto allowing it to run a specially defensive set for Arceus-Water instead.</li> <li>Due to being locked into one move, Ditto can be countered by a surprise Tera from threats such as Tera Fairy Eternatus and Tera Ghost Arceus, so another form of reliable revenge killing such as Arceus and Choice Band Marshadow is appreciated.</li> </ul>"

After a boost, it also OHKOes Calyrex-I and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Mega Mewtwo Y to hit Yveltal while also dissuading Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Zygarde, and Rayquaza from switching into an unscouted Mega Mewtwo Y. Focus Blast allows Mega Mewtwo Y to threaten Arceus-Dark. However, no matter which coverage move is chosen, Mega Mewtwo Y will have a problem with either Arceus-Dark or Yveltal that must be accounted for with teammates.</li> <li>Base Mewtwo's Unnerve may prove very situationally useful to prevent berries from being used against Mewtwo such as in the case of Chople Berry Arceus when running Focus Blast or in forcing initial poison damage on Lum Berry users from Toxic Spikes. However, Mega Mewtwo Y is required to Mega Evolve to outspeed threats like offensive Eternatus.</li> <li>88 Defense EVs allow Mega Mewtwo Y to survive Life Orb Marshadow's Shadow Sneak, while 216 Speed EVs lets Mega Mewtwo Y outspeed Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao while also ensuring that base Mewtwo outspeeds Marshadow. It’s not always required to immediately Mega Evolve, as Mega Mewtwo Y's reduced Defense may allow Choice Band Marshadow’s Shadow Sneak and Arceus-Dark's Foul Play to OHKO it.</li> <li>Mega Mewtwo Y should be used as a wallbreaker in the early- and mid-game; removing Pokemon such as defensive Necrozma-DM and defensive Arceus-Ground can help its teammates sweep late-game. Mega Mewtwo Y has the potential to sweep, but it doesn't do so consistently, as it runs into many roadblocks, such as priority from Marshadow and Yveltal.</li> <li>Other offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Meteor Beam Eternatus appreciate Mega Mewtwo Y breaking down checks such as Primal Groudon and defensive Necrozma-DM for them to potentially sweep.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy and defensive Eternatus are amazing partners, as they can switch into Mega Mewtwo Y’s biggest checks in Marshadow, Arceus-Dark, and Yveltal.

However, Terastallizing Shuckle should not be done in most cases unless the opponent has no other form of entry hazard removal. This means Tera Steel is only useful against opposing hyper offense teams with these Mortal Spin leads, as balance and stall teams usually have other hazard removal means like Giratina-O and Ho-Oh that Shuckle cannot block.</li> <li>Shuckle should prioritize getting Sticky Web up against opposing hyper offense, offense, and balance teams. Against slower teams such as stall and Trick Room teams, Stealth Rock is more useful. Though, setting entry hazards up against Trick Room teams is harder due to Hatterene. The best play is to lead with Necrozma-DM instead, as it can burn Hatterene's Trick Room turns thanks to its resistance to Calyrex-I's and Melmetal's STAB moves. Shuckle should instead attempt to set Stealth Rock up against Calyrex-I, burning a turn of Trick Room in the process.</li> <li>If Shuckle survives the first few turns by letting a teammate in with Encore, it can continue to provide value by being sacrificed to safely switch in a teammate or to burn a turn of Trick Room from Hatterene or Psychic Terrain from Tapu Lele.</li> <li>Pokemon that appreciate Sticky Web support from Shuckle like Swords Dance Arceus formes, Primal Kyogre, Primal Groudon, and Eternatus make excellent teammates.</li> <li>Shuckle cannot keep entry hazards up against common Defoggers such as Giratina-O, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh due to its passivity, so teammates that can threaten these Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Meteor Beam Eternatus are appreciated.</li> </ul>"

These combined factors make it difficult to shut down Smeargle.</li> <li>Sticky Web can help to enable threats such as Eruption Primal Groudon, wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, and Ultra Necrozma by letting them outpace threats such as Deoxys-A and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Nuzzle can cripple common Taunt users such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Arceus-Fairy. Spore is great for crippling opposing hyper offense leads such as Shuckle and Iron Treads. Both options are also valuable in order to punish attempts to remove Smeargle's hazards from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Rapid Spin or Mortal Spin allows Smeargle to clear hazards from opposing hyper offense leads such as Shuckle and Mega Diancie. Rapid Spin is more valuable if Smeargle needs to clear hazards from Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, and it provides a Speed boost to cripple threats such as Yveltal and Palkia-O with Spore or Nuzzle. Mortal Spin can clear hazards against spinblockers such as Lunala and Arceus-Ghost and poison them in the process, but it's at the cost of being more susceptible to Tera Steel Pokemon such as Yveltal. The poison chip damage is also valued by Smeargle's partners such as Ultra Necrozma and Rayquaza to break through checks like Arceus-Dark easier.</li> <li>Ceaseless Edge and Stone Axe can grant Smeargle access to extra utility with unblockable hazards. Magic Coat is another option to prevent Taunt users like Yveltal, Arceus-Ground, and Deoxys-S from shutting down Smeargle's attempts to set up Sticky Web.</li> <li>Smeargle's moveset is very flexible and can be mixed and matched to however you feel to deal with specific scenarios. Running Parting Shot or Teleport can generate momentum for the team while still preserving Smeargle potentially, and running both Stone Axe and Ceaseless Edge in the last two moveslots is possible if you don't care about opposing hazards. However, the given moveset is generally the most optimized variant of Smeargle.</li> <li>Technician is the default ability of choice to slightly increase the damage output of Smeargle's utility-focused attacks, without potential inconsistencies by becoming slower at the end of a turn with Moody, but otherwise Moody is a viable alternative to punish passive play from the opponent.</li> <li>Tera Ghost and Steel are used only for dealing with opposing suicide leads such as Iron Treads and Glimmora in order to block their attempts to clear Smeargle's hazards with Rapid Spin and Mortal Spin, respectively. Terastallization should only be used on Smeargle for absolute emergencies, as it takes the opportunity away from its wallbreaking partners.</li> <li>Smeargle only should be used as a lead in order to enable its teammates as fast as possible.</li> <li>Attempts to conserve Smeargle for use later in the game are unnecessary, as its sacrifice generates momentum for its teammates.</li> <li>After setting Sticky Web, Smeargle should make every effort to keep Sticky Web up and spread status for as long as possible before it goes down.</li> <li>In addition to partners such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Arceus enjoying Smeargle's Sticky Web to outpace threats like Zacian-C and Marshadow, Smeargle can benefit from spinblockers such as Arceus-Ghost and your own Zacian-C to block Rapid Spin and Mortal Spin, respectively. Nasty Plot Chi-Yu's strong matchups against common forms of hazard removal such as Ho-oh and Yveltal also makes it a great partner for Smeargle.</li> </ul>"

Toxic puts foes such as Calm Mind Arceus formes, Terastallized wallbreaker Eternatus, and Primal Kyogre on a timer, preventing them from using Blissey as setup fodder. Thunder Wave is an option to hinder checks it lures in such as Marshadow, Chien-Pao, and Eternatus, enabling Blissey's allies to easily outspeed them.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge. The given Speed IVs ensure that Blissey underspeeds Alomomola, allowing Blissey to hinder whichever foe Alomomola would try to otherwise safely bring in with Flip Turn while remaining as fast as possible beyond that for other threats such as Garganacl.</li> <li>Tera Dark allows Blissey to act as a soft-check to Psychic-type spam teams, notably also letting it consistently check Mega Mewtwo Y and to a lesser degree, Lunala by becoming immune to Psyshock and Psystrike. Tera Grass lets Blissey hard-check Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Zygarde. Either Tera type can be selected depending on the potential role compression desired for a team.</li> <li>As Blissey can be used to safely pivot from threats, it can often be used to absorb status conditions from foes such as Giratina-O, defensive Ho-Oh, and Eternatus, then safely bring in a check to them such as Chien-Pao, Marshadow, or Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Blissey's low physical bulk is easy to take advantage of by nearly every offensive physical attacker in the metagame.

Otherwise, Ho-Oh's longevity will be compromised, or it will be forced to Terastallize.</li> <li>Ho-Oh should be preserved at good health if the opposing team has strong threats that it's meant to check, such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde. When handling setup sweepers, it's more consistently reliable for Ho-Oh to use Whirlwind than to inflict a burn with Sacred Fire. However, this strategy shouldn't be relied on too much late-game, as Whirlwind fails when only a single foe remains.</li> <li>As it's tasked with answering many different threats, Ho-Oh can get overwhelmed if heavily relied on.

The alternate EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Silk Scarf Arceus's Extreme Speed and the OHKO from +1 Zacian-C's Wild Charge, outspeeds Adamant Necrozma-DM and Marshadow after a Flame Charge boost, and invests the remaining EVs into Attack to maximize damage output.</li> <li>Tera Ground is the primary option to allow Ho-Oh to OHKO Meteor Beam Eternatus and make Earthquake far more threatening for Primal Groudon. Tera Ground also comes with the added benefit of removing Ho-Oh's weakness to Stealth Rock, thus making Ho-Oh far less afraid of losing its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off, which is especially notable when Defog is chosen.</li> <li>Tera Fire is also an option to boost Flare Blitz damage, and it is the preferred option with the move, closing important gaps such as 2HKOing maximum HP support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock damage and outright OHKOing offensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Don't be afraid to switch Ho-Oh into targets that it's typically able to check like specially offensive Giratina-O and Arceus-Fairy to force them out and start making progress.</li> <li>Ho-Oh gains significant advantages from entry hazard-stacking. In fact, though its damage output remains formidable, Brave Bird often fails to achieve certain benchmarks, such as securing a 2HKO against defensive Primal Kyogre or support Arceus formes, without additional support. This means it often finds itself on bulky offense teams that can consistently get up hazards and maintain them throughout the game.</li> <li>An offensive Stealth Rock or Spikes variant of Primal Groudon makes for a great teammate, being able to set up entry hazards for both itself and Ho-Oh and appreciating the many status conditions Ho-Oh is capable of spreading to ease setup with Swords Dance. Primal Kyogre also has great synergy with Ho-Oh offensively, greatly appreciating the heavy damage Ho-Oh gets on targets like defensive Eternatus and Primal Groudon so Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh can help each other blow massive holes into the opposing team.</li> <li>Zacian-C is a deadly partner, capable of sweeping entire teams with the prior damage Ho-Oh can inflict on many of its main checks such as Primal Groudon and Coil Zygarde while being able to put immense pressure on most variants of defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Equipped with a Choice Band, Ho-Oh is a powerful wallbreaker that threatens to OHKO or 2HKO a large majority of the tier, including staples like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ho-Oh's Brave Bird is easily spammable thanks to the lack of Flying-resistant Pokemon in the metagame. It's capable of OHKOing staples like offensive Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma after Stealth Rock damage and can 2HKO Yveltal, utility Arceus formes after Stealth Rock, and opposing defensive Ho-Oh. Its recoil is usually easy to pilot around thanks to Regenerator.</li> <li>Sacred Fire deals hefty damage to Steel-types, 2HKOing Necrozma-DM and OHKOing Zacian-C and Ferrothorn. Sponging a burn is also very annoying for common switch-ins like Zygarde, Giratina, and Eternatus, as it cuts their passive recovery. Flare Blitz can be used alternatively for its higher PP and slightly higher Base Power, but the reduced chance to burn combined with the lack of important targets that would fall to Flare Blitz makes it a generally inferior option compared to Sacred Fire.</li> <li>Earthquake threatens Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM with super effective damage. It comes in handy against Primal Groudon, as when compared to Brave Bird, Earthquake has no recoil and can still 2HKO it.</li> <li>The last moveslot is flexible: Defog, while seemingly counter-intuitive on a Choice-locked set, is actually usable thanks to the forced switches Choice Band Ho-Oh produces. Recover can instead be used to grant Ho-Oh even more longevity. These two moves are dangerous to lock into, however, as they leave Ho-Oh completely passive. Alternatively, Flare Blitz can give more flexibility in the Fire-type attack Ho-Oh can use.</li> <li>A Jolly nature alongside maximum EV investment in Speed is recommended so Ho-Oh can always at least Speed tie with base 90 Speed Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Tera Flying further boosts Brave Bird, allowing absurd damages such as always 2HKOing defensive Primal Groudon, Dondozo, and defensive Arceus formes. It also comes in handy defensively, as a pure Flying typing makes Ho-Oh less sensitive to Stealth Rock and Rock-type attacks such as Arceus-Ground's Power Gem. However, it also make it weak to Will-O-Wisp and Ice Beam, which can be detrimental when facing foes like support Arceus formes, Lunala, and Giratina. Meanwhile, it also makes switching on an opposing Ho-Oh risky due to Sacred Fire becoming able to burn your own Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Tera Ground is great both offensively and defensively; it lets Earthquake always 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon, and it even gives a slight chance to OHKO offensive Primal Groudon. Meanwhile, it turns Ho-Oh's 4x weakness to Rock into a resistance, making Ho-Oh vastly more resilient against Stealth Rock and allowing it to lure in and remove most Rock-type attack users, like Primal Groudon, Eternatus, and Meteor Beam Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Regenerator is unable to compensate for Ho-Oh's crippling Stealth Rock weakness. Consequently, Ho-Oh is usually seen on defensive teams that are able to provide consistent entry hazard removal. Accordingly, this enables Ho-Oh to find many safe entry points throughout the game and handle Pokemon these teams have trouble with such as Heavy-Duty Boots Eternatus and Taunt + Calm Mind Arceus formes. This set can also be used to lure in and remove Gothitelle, which is usually a terrible matchup for defensive teams.</li> <li>Ho-Oh requires strong Defog support from teammates like Giratina and support Arceus formes, as the absence of Stealth Rock enables it to be used more aggressively. Ho-Oh can exploit defensive Pokemon such as utility Arceus formes and Eternatus using Recover to find easy entry points to wallbreak. Furthermore, Giratina checks most Primal Groudon sets and brings Pressure support, draining Stealth Rock's PP faster, which makes it a strong teammate for Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Special sponges like Chansey and specially defensive Necrozma-DM help Ho-Oh with pivoting around special attackers, such as Primal Kyogre and Meteor Beam Eternatus. In return, once positioned, Ho-Oh can deal with Taunt Arceus formes, which usually shut them down.</li> </ul>"

Return serves as a weaker but safer STAB move, although it misses out on the 2HKO on foes like Ho-Oh and offensive Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Earthquake is Mega Salamence's best coverage move to hit Steel-types like Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM and to hit Primal Groudon almost as hard as Double-Edge without the recoil damage. At +1, it can OHKO Zacian-C and additionally OHKO Zekrom after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Roost provides Mega Salamence with reliable recovery and helps it find more setup opportunities throughout the battle, while Facade punishes foes that try to status it like Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dark at the cost of making Mega Salamence more sensitive to chip damage while setting up.</li> <li>Mega Salamence, especially when not running Roost, should aim to switch in after a foe has fainted or on a predicted Earthquake from foes like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus. By pressuring these Pokemon to switch out, it can take on the opportunity to set up and start wearing down its checks.</li> <li>In certain scenarios, retaining access to Salamence's Intimidate can prove advantageous due to its capability to mitigate foes that threaten to set up such as Rayquaza and Necrozma-DM. Additionally, the Attack drop can let Mega Salamence avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Poltergeist, offensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, and Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and set up on them.</li> <li>Having weaknesses to Fairy and Ice, Mega Salamence appreciates Fire- and Steel-type teammates such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C that can threaten the likes of opposing Zacian-C, Arceus-Fairy, and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Fairy-type teammates like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy love Mega Salamence's ability to check Steel- and Fire-types such as Magearna and Primal Groudon and threaten them with Earthquake.</li> <li>Mega Salamence works well on hyper offense teams, and suicide entry hazard leads such as Deoxys-S and Glimmora are invaluable in helping it sweep; the aforementioned Pokemon can also prevent hazards.

Even though Origin Pulse's accuracy can be detrimental, it is usually preferred over Water Spout because its power does not diminish proportionally with Primal Kyogre's HP.</li> <li>Ice Beam covers Dragon- and Grass-types that would resist Primal Kyogre's STAB attacks, like Giratina-O, Eternatus, Mega Salamence, and Tera Grass Ho-Oh, and hits Primal Groudon trying to switch in on Primal Kyogre to replace Primordial Sea with Desolate Land.</li> <li>Thunder hits Water-types like Arceus-Water, Tera Water Zygarde, and opposing Primal Kyogre for super effective damage. Thunder can also be used to fish for paralysis against Eternatus, as a paralyzed Eternatus has much more trouble dealing with Primal Kyogre due to the full paralysis chance and paralysis's drop in Speed, making Primal Kyogre faster and able to 2HKO Eternatus with Ice Beam at +1.</li> <li>Calm Mind is used to further boost Primal Kyogre's already ridiculously high Special Attack. At +1, Origin Pulse OHKOes specially defensive Necrozma-DM most of the time and Arceus-Dark all of the time.</li> <li>A Modest nature is generally recommended in order to maximize its damage output. A Timid nature can be run in order to always at least Speed tie with Primal Groudon and opposing Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>This Primal Kyogre set is best used as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker, where its powerful rain-boosted STAB moves and coverage options threaten many staples in the tier, like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM. Due to Water Spout's mechanics, it's often better to bring Primal Kyogre safely on a predicted recovery move like Arceus-Ground's Recover or by anticipating a switch.</li> <li>Sticky Web teams particularly like this set for its devastating wallbreaking ability. With Sticky Web up, Primal Kyogre can actively threaten what would otherwise be faster threats, such as Zacian-C, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo formes. Thus, Sticky Web setters like Shuckle and Smeargle are great teammates.</li> <li>Usual members of hyper offensive archetypes work well with Primal Kyogre; for example, Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma threatens Chansey and Heavy-Duty Boots Eternatus, two Pokemon that Primal Kyogre has trouble dealing with. In return, Primal Kyogre helps against physically bulky Pokemon such as Arceus-Dark, Zygarde, and Primal Groudon. Yveltal's capacity to remove Heavy-Duty Boots makes Primal Kyogre even harder to switch into when Sticky Web is up. In return, Primal Kyogre threatens to OHKO Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, which are common answers to Sticky Web and Yveltal, respectively. Zacian-C outruns and threatens to OHKO Arceus and Yveltal, two common troublemakers for hyper offensive teams.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Defensive Primal Kyogre is an oppressive force against bulkier teams, as it is able to shrug off weak attacks and passive damage that significantly hinder wallbreaker sets. Additionally, its base 180 Special Attack in conjunction with Scald and Ice Beam enables Primal Kyogre to trade with many offensive threats such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence, even without offensive investment. These traits make Primal Kyogre an essential component of the defensive backbone on many balance teams.</li> <li>Aside from powering up Primal Kyogre's attacks, Calm Mind enables Primal Kyogre to turn the tables on some switch-ins that typically check wallbreaker sets, such as Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Ditto, by turning them into setup fodder. It can also be used to gain a free boost on Primal Groudon that switches in to sacrifice itself to entry hazards and reset the weather.</li> <li>Scald is Primal Kyogre's STAB move of choice due to its higher PP, accuracy, and ability to hinder physical attackers such as Arceus and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Ice Beam provides Primal Kyogre the ability to hit Primal Groudon, which is its primary switch-in on most teams. While it only 4HKOes Primal Groudon, it will be quickly worn down due to its vulnerability to all entry hazards and its lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, Ice Beam prevents Primal Kyogre from being set up on by the many threatening Dragon-types of the tier, such as Ultra Necrozma, Eternatus, and Mega Salamence. Ice Beam also plays a role in enabling Primal Kyogre to function as a wincon against stall teams, as it would otherwise run out of Scald PP.</li> <li>Rest is primarily used against bulkier balance and stall teams to help accumulate Calm Mind boosts, as most of the Pokemon found on these teams cannot meaningfully damage it. Rest generally should not used against more offensive teams, as the two free turns are highly exploitable and will likely be leveraged by Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Arceus to boost into a range where they are able to sweep. As such, Primal Kyogre is better off attempting to trade with or weaken a Pokemon on more offensive teams.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Primal Kyogre to survive some very powerful attacks that one would assume would knock it out. For example, Primal Kyogre is 2HKOed by +1 Mega Salamence's Double Edge and +1 Zacian-C's Wild Charge and 3HKOed by uninvested Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades. Additionally, unboosted Primal Kyogre is 3HKOed by Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse with this EV spread.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Kyogre generally should not be used early-game, though it can be used as a lead against hyper offense teams, as Scald provides the chance to OHKO dedicated leads such as Shuckle, Smeargle, and Glimmora due to its burn chance, preventing them from setting multiple entry hazards. Primal Kyogre generally struggles against more offensive structures due to its limited hit-taking capabilities and often trades against a singular Pokemon at best. Defensive Primal Kyogre usually finds its first entry point mid-game, and it can use Ice Beam to heavily chip Primal Groudon that switches in for the benefit of teammates such as Zacian-C. Against balance teams, Primal Kyogre plays a critical role in dismantling or weakening the defensive backbone of the opposing team to allow more offensively inclined teammates such as Power Herb Eternatus and Arceus-Ground to sweep.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre has the tendency to be overwhelmed by powerful attackers, especially Swords Dance Primal Groudon, which capitalizes on the free turn where Primal Kyogre is forced out. Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dark can check powerful physical attackers while also appreciating Primal Kyogre's ability to deal with Ho-Oh especially since Zygarde specifically can be frustrated by Ho-Oh's phazing. Additionally, due to Primal Kyogre's middling matchup into offensive structures, Marshadow and Ditto make good teammates due to their ability to revenge kill many of the most threatening Pokemon found on these structures, such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre also appreciates both entry hazard support and removal, as both Primal Kyogre and Pokemon that threaten it are pushed into KO range with the presence of entry hazards. Consequently, Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Groudon with Overheat are excellent teammates. Ho-Oh is the best Defogger and defensive pivot in the tier and also phazes many Pokemon that may view Primal Kyogre as a setup opportunity, such as Eternatus and Zacian-C. Primal Groudon provides entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock or Spikes.</li> <li>Although Primal Kyogre will not sweep stall teams by itself, it requires little support to achieve a gamestate where it is able to do so. As in other matchups, Primal Kyogre generally does not have an early-game presence, as it relies on teammates such as Overheat Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh to set and remove entry hazards. Overheat Primal Groudon eases the burden on Primal Kyogre against stall teams, as it 2HKOes Dondozo, a staple on stall teams, after Stealth Rock. Additionally, Primal Kyogre requires some help against Confide Chansey. Consequently, Eternatus is an excellent teammate, as Pressure in conjunction with bulk allows it to absorb Confide and Seismic Toss, which allows Primal Kyogre to make progress.</li> </ul>"

Spikes is an option that deals more damage to Rock-resistant foes, like Arceus-Ground and Zygarde.</li> <li>Precipice Blade 2HKOes neutral targets like Primal Kyogre, and it has a solid chance to OHKO Eternatus as well as a small chance to OHKO opposing offensive Primal Groudon after one layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Rock Tomb hits Ho-Oh and Yveltal for super effective damage and is a great tool to cripple Speed-boosting foes like Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Scale Shot and Dragon Dance Zygarde.

Stone Edge alternatively OHKOes defensive Ho-Oh, 2HKOes defensive Yveltal, and 2HKOes Giratina-O after Stealth Rock at +2.</li> <li>The default EV spread ensures an OHKO on defensive Ho-Oh with Stone Edge, an OHKO on Hasty Eruption Primal Groudon with Precipice Blades, and a 2HKO on physical utility Giratina-O at +2 without Stealth Rock. It also lets Primal Groudon avoid an OHKO from +3 Zacian-C's Tera Fighting Close Combat after Stealth Rock and a 2HKO from wallbreaker Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. The alternate spread is intended for variants without Stone Edge; it lets Primal Groudon avoid an OHKO from Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost and maximizes its physical bulk, notably letting it avoid an OHKO from +2 Zacian-C's Tera Blast Ground.</li> <li>Primal Groudon generally forces switches out of the innate difficulty of scouting its set early-game. Because of this, it's often ideal to lead with Primal Groudon and set entry hazards, especially as its high mixed bulk makes it difficult to immediately KO. However, its defensive utility can prove crucial to check a wide variety of foes in the metagame such as Primal Kyogre, Marshadow, and Zacian-C, so it should be preserved mid-game if the opposing team has foes Primal Groudon's team could struggle with otherwise.</li> <li>Primal Groudon has a poor matchup against a common Defogger in Giratina-O, so wallbreakers that threaten it such as Marshadow, Meteor Beam Eternatus, and Zacian-C make for good allies. Defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Arceus formes with Refresh also act as reliable switch-ins for this purpose.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes with Taunt can shut down Primal Groudon from setting hazards or applying offensive pressure with Swords Dance; Arceus-Ground and Zygarde in particular can directly threaten Primal Groudon without setting up with their Ground-type STAB moves.

It can also be situationally useful to deny Dragon Dance users like Mega Salamence and Ultra Necrozma the ability to boost their Speed. Alternatively, Toxic can be used over Rock Tomb to cripple switch-ins like Giratina-O that otherwise don't really mind taking Primal Groudon's other moves. Either Stealth Rock or Spikes exploits the many switches Primal Groudon forces, especially given that Primal Groudon can effectively threaten most Defog users with its natural power and moveset.</li> <li>252 Special Attack EVs with a Mild Nature ensure that Overheat hits maximally hard, while 160 Speed on Rock Tomb sets outspeed a -1 Marshadow. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense to better handle Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, if Primal Groudon is not running Rock Tomb, a spread of 104 HP / 8 Def / 244 SpA / 152 Spe can be used to avoid a 2HKO from Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam and an OHKO from +1 Life Orb Marshadow's Low Kick after Stealth Rock while outspeeding Adamant Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Because this Primal Groudon set is much less bulky than other variants, it should be used aggressively. A common case is to send it in on something it can OHKO with Overheat, such as Yveltal. Once the opponent is aware of the set, Primal Groudon can instead use these opportunities as a way to set its entry hazard of choice. If the opponent is likely to switch in something that can take Primal Groudon's STAB combination well, such as Giratina-O and Ho-Oh, that is also a good time to set hazards or use Rock Tomb or Toxic to punish the switch.</li> <li>Alternatively, a defensive set can be bluffed to lure these targets in, though once Primal Groudon is attacked, the amount of damage it takes will tend to expose the set. This variant of Primal Groudon can be an effective lead, but it can also be saved for later if Primal Groudon might be anti-led by Pokemon like defensive Primal Kyogre and Zygarde; Overheat's KO potential also goes up dramatically when foes such as Arceus-Ground are chipped.</li> <li>Due to the lack of defensive investment, this set of Primal Groudon is unable to handle Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma in any capacity, so hard checks such as Arceus-Dark and Yveltal can prove effective. Both are also able to keep entry hazards up with their fast Taunts while also handling Defog Giratina-O, which Primal Groudon can struggle to threaten; they also check Zygarde, which can use Primal Groudon as setup fodder.</li> <li>Primal Groudon's Ground weakness makes it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground, other Primal Groudon, and Zygarde, so Pokemon such as the aforementioned Yveltal and Giratina-O can go a long way in providing counterplay.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Band Rayquaza is a terror capable of 2HKOing the entire tier. Coupled with its base 95 Speed, which outpaces most of the defensive metagame, and U-turn for momentum, it is a valued wallbreaker on many balance and bulky offense teams. Even in less favorable matchups, such as against hyper offense, Rayquaza can still frequently trade with Pokemon such as Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Rayquaza's power lies in Dragon Ascent, which can 2HKO most pokemon. Even Dondozo, an excellent physical wall, is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Defensive Necrozma-DM, the only somewhat common switch-in to Dragon Ascent, is OHKOed by V-create after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake is an alternative to V-create that still 2HKOes defensive Necrozma-DM while avoiding the Speed drop. U-turn provides a very scarce source of momentum while taking advantage of the many Pokemon Rayquaza scares out such as Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Extreme Speed allows Rayquaza to revenge kill some boosted Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground and Ultra Necrozma after some chip damage, though it should be used cautiously because it leaves Rayquaza extremely vulnerable to being used as setup fodder.</li> <li>32 HP and 8 Defense EVs enable Rayquaza to survive Mega Salamence's Double Edge and switch in with Stealth Rock present 4 times, while also avoiding a OHKO from offensive Calm Mind Arceus-Ground's Ice Beam after Rayquaza has Terastallized. This conveniently costs Rayquaza little, as it still is able to outpace most of the defensive metagame such as Primal Groudon without reducing its offensive firepower.</li> <li>Tera Flying boosts Dragon Ascent to an absurd level of power that mandates checking Rayquaza offensively, as defensive Necrozma-DM is the only common switch-in. This forces aggressive play to limit Rayquaza, as Tera Flying Dragon Ascent OHKOes some Pokemon that would otherwise trade with Rayquaza such as offensive and defensive Primal Kyogre. Tera Flying also provides some practical defensive benefits due to it removing weaknesses while maintaining Rayquaza's immunity to Sticky Web, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. For example, after Terastallization, Rayquaza survives offensive Calm Mind Arceus-Ground's +1 Ice Beam and Meteor Beam Eternatus's +1 Dynamax Cannon. Both of these Pokemon offensively can deal heavy damage to Rayquaza, but in turn are OHKOed by Rayquaza due to the power boost from Tera Flying.</li> <li>Rayquaza is best used early- and mid-game to break the defensive backbone of balance and stall teams. Rayquaza is a solid lead due to its positive matchups against common balance leads such as defensive Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark, as the chip damage from U-turn renders them unable to switch into Rayquaza later in the game as it brings in a teammate that can scare them out. Defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and utility Arceus formes cannot tank a Dragon Ascent while remaining healthy enough to check Rayquaza's teammates. This results in a win-win situation where Rayquaza can either continue pivoting or wallbreak mid-game.</li> <li>Rayquaza's efficacy as a wallbreaker truly shines against stall teams, as the sole Flying-resistant foe on them is the rare Mega Tyranitar, meaning Rayquaza only has to worry about managing Dragon Ascent PP because it 2HKOes Dondozo and Arceus-Dark, which are the answers to physically offensive threats for most stall teams. However, Rayquaza struggles against more offensive teams, as its middling Speed tier makes it easily revenge killed or set up on by Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Ultra Necrozma. This often limits Rayquaza to trading KOs against offensive teams, though it can be used as a revenge killer if needed.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is an excellent teammate for Rayquaza due to checking common switch-ins such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, and it can be brought in safely against these threats via U-turn. Marshadow is also a good teammate because it revenge kills hyper offense such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C, alleviating the need for Rayquaza to revenge kill boosted threats so it can focus on wallbreaking or trading.</li> <li>Rayquaza also appreciates Defog support from Giratina-O or Ho-Oh due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Though Rayquaza does not enjoy the presence of Stealth Rock, it is not immediately hamstrung by it and can still effectively wallbreak against balance and bulky offense teams. Since Rayquaza outspeeds all of its targets except Timid utility Arceus formes, removing them to enable teammates is often worth the cost of some HP in situations where Stealth Rock cannot be removed immediately. However, Stealth Rock heavily hinders Rayquaza's potency as a pivot in longer games against bulkier balance and stall teamms, so removal should be prioritized in these matchups.</li> </ul>"

      "Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Sporting a sky-high Attack stat, a powerful Flying-type STAB move in the form of Dragon Ascent, and amazing coverage alongside a decent Speed tier, Rayquaza is a powerful sweeper that is able fit on many offensive teams as either a threatening sweeper with Dragon Dance or a terrifying wallbreaker with Swords Dance on teams with Sticky Web support.</li> <li>Extreme Speed gives Rayquaza powerful priority that allows it to thwart revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A, OHKOing the former after a Swords Dance while OHKOing the latter unboosted, as well as letting Rayquaza pick off weakened boosted foes such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>V-create gives Rayquaza great coverage alongside Dragon Ascent, OHKOing Zacian-C and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock, which could otherwise take on Rayquaza, at the cost of lowering Rayquaza's Speed. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over V-create for similar coverage against Steel-type Pokemon that doesn't drop Rayquaza's defenses and Speed while also letting it hit Zekrom and Primal Groudon much harder after a boost. However, the power drop is significant, as Earthquake cannot OHKO Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used over Adamant to maximize Rayquaza's Speed, which notably lets it outspeed offensive Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and utility Arceus formes, as well as Zacian-C and the rest of the metagame after a boost.</li> <li>Tera Flying jacks up the power of Dragon Ascent, letting Rayquaza 2HKO Dondozo and OHKO Pokemon such as defensive Ho-Oh and Eternatus at +1. Tera Fire gives Rayquaza an immunity to burns from Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, which can help Rayquaza set up against them, and it also gives Rayquaza STAB on V-create, which allows the move to OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM. Tera Fire also turns Rayquaza's previous Ice and Fairy weaknesses into resistances against Pokemon like Arceus-Ground carrying Ice Beam and Zacian-C, respectively. Tera Normal gives Rayquaza STAB on Extreme Speed, which allows +2 Extreme Speed to OHKO Pokemon like offensive Yveltal and Palkia-O, and it also prevents Marshadow from revenge killing Rayquaza with Shadow Sneak or stealing Swords Dance boosts with Spectral Thief.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Rayquaza best fits on hyper offense teams, while Swords Dance Rayquaza best fits on Sticky Web teams. Swords Dance Rayquaza can use Extreme Speed to prevent faster Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Salamence, and Deoxys-A from revenge killing it and to outpace other common forms of priority such as Extreme Speed from Swords Dance Arceus and Sucker Punch from Yveltal. Once its checks, such as Yveltal and Zacian-C, are eliminated, Rayquaza can function well as a mid-game wallbreaker by spamming Dragon Ascent against many neutral targets such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus along with its coverage for Steel-type Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, or it can alternatively grab setup opportunities against Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground lacking Ice Beam.</li> <li>Since Rayquaza is found on hyper offense teams, leads such as Deoxys-S, Shuckle, and Smeargle are mandatory for setting the tempo of the game, with Deoxys-S pairing well with Dragon Dance Rayquaza by setting entry hazards, allowing Rayquaza to clinch KOs on bulky Pokemon such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM, and Shuckle or Smeargle pairing beautifully with Swords Dance Rayquaza by setting Sticky Web to allow Rayquaza to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Marshadow. Dual screens setters such as Grimmsnarl can also help Rayquaza sweep by making it easier for it to set up with Dragon Dance.</li> <li>Offensive teammates that can cover Rayquaza's weaknesses such as Zacian-C and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM are helpful, as they can pressure Rayquaza's offensive checks in Mega Mewtwo Y and Arceus-Fairy. In return, Rayquaza can help by chipping down Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for Zacian-C and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM to more easily break through. Other teammates such as Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma are all great to overwhelm shared checks such as Yveltal and defensive Primal Groudon while denting huge holes in the opposition for Rayquaza to clean up.</li> </ul>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Deoxys-A's unrivaled power, great coverage, and amazing Speed tier let it serve as an almost unwallable mid-to-late-game wallbreaker that can also double as a revenge killer.</li> <li>Psycho Boost OHKOes offensive Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Eternatus, Rayquaza, and Zygarde, while being able to OHKO Terastallized offensive Eternatus and Zygarde after slight chip damage.</li> <li>Low Kick has consistently high Base Power thanks to the high general weight of Pokemon in National Dex Ubers, and it 2HKOes Dark-type Pokemon like Arceus-Dark and offensive Yveltal without any drawbacks. Low Kick also hits Necrozma-DM for a reasonable amount of damage and does large amounts of damage into certain specially bulky Pokemon like Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Shadow Ball has virtually perfect neutral coverage with Low Kick and hits Necrozma-DM, which otherwise is not particularly threatened by Deoxys-A's moves, for a 2HKO. With Tera Ghost, Shadow Ball becomes genuinely powerful, allowing it to OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y, Ultra Necrozma, and Necrozma-DM after a layer of Spikes, and 2HKO almost everything it hits neutrally. It should be noted, however, that a super effective Shadow Ball is weaker than a neutral Psycho Boost unless Terastallization is used, which can make Deoxys-A a bit reliant on such a mechanic to act as a proper wallbreaker in these matchups.</li> <li>At the cost of making Deoxys-A reliant on Terastallization to use Ghost-type coverage, running Tera Blast over Shadow Ball makes Deoxys-A much less exploitable overall. Due to becoming physical after Psycho Boost is used and coming off of Deoxys-A's base 180 Attack, Tera Blast is barely weakened, and it can confirm a KO on a badly poisoned Ho-Oh switching into Psycho Boost—making running dedicated coverage for Ho-Oh much less necessary—while still being incredibly difficult to switch into. Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are still 2HKOed by a physical Tera Blast Ghost, and physical Tera Blast also retains the ability to OHKO Ultra Necrozma, Mega Mewtwo Y, and offensive Lunala, preventing these threats from exploiting Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Running Rock Slide allows Deoxys-A to potentially OHKO defensive Ho-Oh, dissuading it from consistently sponging attacks from Deoxys-A and allowing Deoxys-A to defeat it one-on-one. Because Rock Slide is physical, it can safely be used after Psycho Boost is used, increasing its general consistency. It also hits Yveltal harder than Low Kick, notably 2HKOing defensive variants.</li> <li>Ice Beam hits Yveltal harder than Rock Slide, OHKOing all variants after Stealth Rock, while relieving Deoxys-A of the need to use Psycho Boost to OHKO targets like Zygarde, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Extreme Speed is a third option over Rock Slide that gives Deoxys-A more play against offensive teams. Not only does it allow Deoxys-A to revenge kill weakened Speed boosters like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Salamence, but it also allows Deoxys-A to prevent Ditto from revenge killing it via Tera Ghost + Extreme Speed and gives Deoxys-A counterplay against Sucker Punch Yveltal.</li> <li>A Naive nature with 252 Speed EVs is ran to ensure that Deoxys-A outspeeds Zacian-C and Mega Mewtwo Y, allowing it to threaten them. The Speed also allows Deoxys-A Speed tie opposing Deoxys-A and outspeed slower foes at +1, such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde. 29 HP IVs reduce Life Orb recoil.</li> <li>In addition to the offensive power boost to Deoxys-A's Ghost-type coverage, Tera Ghost gives Deoxys-A an immunity to Extreme Speed, allowing it to check Arceus and Rayquaza. In certain cases, however, Tera Normal may be considered to blank Marshadow while allowing Psycho Boost + Extreme Speed to often KO Ho-Oh from full health, but the immunity is otherwise useless and doing this denies Deoxys-A the option of having powerful Ghost-type coverage, making it easier to handle overall.</li> <li>Because Deoxys-A is absurdly frail, it should never be brought into an attack, lest it get OHKOed. Instead, it should be brought in via the use of double switches, after a Pokemon is KOed, or via a slow pivot. It should also only be attacking if it can OHKO the target or if a switch is predicted.</li> <li>Deoxys-A can be extremely reliant on entry hazards and general chip damage to secure many notable OHKOs, so hazard setters like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Eternatus are good partners.</li> <li>Deoxys-A is easily revenge killed by Marshadow and checked by Dark-types like Yveltal—particularly Sucker Punch variants—and Arceus-Dark, so Pokemon that handle them well like Arceus-Fairy and support variants of Yveltal are useful teammates. The former can also be handy against Arceus-Dark and Yveltal, which can otherwise be a great hinderance to Deoxys-A, while the latter is a rare source of pivoting in U-turn, which can be used to give Deoxys-A additional wallbreaking opportunities.</li> </ul>"

Counter is an alternative to OHKO foes such as Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh after luring an attack while having its Focus Sash intact, giving a means for Deoxys-A to play around such checks.</li> <li>Shadow Ball provides coverage to super effectively target anti-leads such as Necrozma-DM and Deoxys-S, avoiding passivity and giving the rest of its team an easier chance to break past them by wearing them down.</li> <li>Icy Wind allows Deoxys-A to anti-lead Deoxys-S, enabling Deoxys-A to outspeed and KO it with Shadow Ball afterwards. This move can also be used to wear down setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, rendering them easier to revenge kill by mitigating their Speed stat boosts.</li> <li>Tera Steel grants an immunity to Glimmora's Mortal Spin, giving the situational use to preserve entry hazards on the other side of the field.</li> <li>By keeping Deoxys-A for the middle stages of the game instead of leading with it, it can bluff as another set variant of itself, allowing it to set entry hazards mid-game on expected switches. This strategy is usually ideal if the foe is likely to lead with a Pokemon that Deoxys-A can't play around depending on its set, such as Yveltal for sets without Icy Wind, and Grimmsnarl for any variant outside of Taunt, but entry hazards should be kept out of its side of the field to ensure Deoxys-A can use its Focus Sash.</li> <li>As the offensive pressure of Deoxys-A relies on forcing the opponent to scout its moveset, it's best to not unecessarily reveal parts of its moveset unless the situation calls for it.</li> <li>Deoxys-A can struggle to get past Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark, and Steel-types including Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, therefore allies such as Tera Electric Zacian-C, Marshadow, and Double Dance Primal Groudon make great allies to wallbreak past them.</li> <li>Hyper offense Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Eternatus appreciate the entry hazards laid by Deoxys-A to more often threaten the opposing team with a sweep by wearing down their checks and punishing switching.</li> </ul>"

Psycho Boost is Deoxys-A’s most powerful Psychic-type STAB move, providing Deoxys-A with a strong wallbreaking attack even when Psychic Terrain isn’t active. Psycho Boost OHKOes Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, defensive Arceus-Water, and wallbreaker Primal Kyogre at +1 after two layers of Spikes.</li> <li>Focus Blast provides essential coverage against Arceus-Dark and Zacian-C. Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse are both options for coverage against Necrozma-DM. If Deoxys-A is Tera Ghost, Shadow Ball should be chosen for the increased boost, as it guarantees a 2HKO on Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Otherwise, Dark Pulse should be chosen due to its flinch chance.</li> <li>Tera Psychic allows Deoxys-A to OHKO Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, defensive Arceus-Water, and Wallbreaker Primal Kyogre with Psycho Boost at +1, and OHKO Ho-Oh at +1 under Psychic Terrain. For Expanding Force, Tera Psychic gives Deoxys-A a chance to 2HKO Chansey under Psychic Terrain at +1. However, Tera Psychic leaves Deoxys-A susceptible to priority if Psychic Terrain isn’t active.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Deoxys-A to avoid being revenge killed by Extreme Speed from Arceus and Rayquaza while also boosting Shadow Ball. Tera Normal prevents Marshadow and Giratina-O from revenge killing it with Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>As Deoxys-A is a potent wallbreaker even without a boost, it does not need to use Meteor Beam until the prime opportunity for a sweep, such as when its checks in Yveltal or Ho-Oh have been baited in.</li> <li>As Deoxys-A is extremely frail, it should only switch in on a free turn such as after a teammate faints. On Psychic Terrain teams, it is best to sacrifice Tapu Lele as a means to give Deoxys-A a free switch in and maximize the time it can take advantage of Psychic Terrain.</li> <li>Tapu Lele is an essential teammate for Psychic Terrain, as it is the most viable setter. Meteor Beam Lunala pairs well with Deoxys-A on Psychic Terrain teams, as the two of them can overwhelm Yveltal and Ho-Oh defensive cores. With Lunala eliminating one of these threats, Deoxys-A is free to use its Meteor Beam to eliminate the other part of the core without worrying about being stopped in the middle of a sweep afterwards.</li> <li>Glimmora is an excellent teammate for Deoxys-A, as the entry hazard it provides eases sweeping. In addition, Toxic Spikes is able to chip Arceus-Dark, which puts it in Focus Blast range. In return, Deoxys-A is able to threaten common Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Smeargle and Shuckle can be used instead to provide Sticky Web, as this greatly aids other Psychic Terrain teammates such as Lunala and Basculegion.</li> </ul>"

Alternatively, Draco Meteor enables Palkia-O to nab some OHKOs on Pokemon that Spacial Rend cannot, such as defensive Eternatus, Zygarde-C, and Eruption Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>A Modest nature is preferred to enhance Palkia-O's wallbreaking capabilities. A Timid nature is usable if outspeeding Adamant Ultra Necrozma and Speed tying Calm Mind Arceus formes is desired. However, running a Timid nature comes at the cost of never OHKOing defensive Eternatus, turning defensive Primal Groudon into a roll to 2HKO, and rarely 2HKOing Primal Kyogre with Spacial Rend.</li> <li>Tera Water is used over Tera Dragon, since Primal Groudon is 2HKOed by Spacial Rend regardless. Tera Water Hydro Pump is capable of OHKOing Ho-Oh, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after a single layer of Spikes, and support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Palkia-O is best used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams to tear through the defensive backbone of balance teams. It struggles against hyper offense teams, as it can be outsped or set up on, limiting the damage it can do. Against these teams, Palkia-O is often limited to trading. Additionally, Palkia-O completely thuds into stall, as it is fully walled by Chansey.</li> <li>Choice Band Marshadow is an excellent teammate, as it is able to revenge kill many Pokemon that use Palkia-O as setup fodder on hyper offense teams, such as Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, Arceus, and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Ho-Oh makes an excellent partner, as it is able to switch in on Pokemon that scare Palkia-O out, such as Arceus-Fairy, Deoxys-A, and Zacian-C. Furthermore, Palkia-O greatly appreciates Defog support from Ho-Oh due to its vulnerability to every entry hazard and lack of recovery.</li> <li>Palkia-O also appreciates teammates that match up well into stall, such as specially offensive Yveltal and Overheat Primal Groudon.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Giratina is an excellent wall on stall teams thanks to its massive mixed bulk and useful typing. This makes it an excellent check to threats such as Primal Groudon and Arceus. Giratina has useful utility with Defog and pairs well with Ho-Oh as a double Defog core. The two are able to consistently keep entry hazards off throughout the game, as Giratina can use Defog against Primal Groudon, while Ho-Oh can use Defog against defensive Eternatus. In addition, Giratina has a very valuable PP stalling ability in Pressure, allowing it to stall the PP of Choice Band Rayquaza, an extremely dangerous wallbreaker against stall.</li> <li>Dragon Tail allows Giratina to phaze setup sweepers such as Arceus, Zekrom, and Necrozma-DM while dealing respectable damage to frailer Dragon-type setup sweepers such as Rayquaza and Mega Salamence. Dragon Tail is also a great way to spread chip damage against the opposing team, especially with entry hazard support from Arceus-Dark, Eternatus, or Mega Tyranitar.</li> <li>Toxic allows Giratina to slowly damage targets such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh while preventing wallbreakers such as specially offensive Yveltal, Lunala, and Rayquaza from switching in freely.</li> <li>Defog allows Giratina to remove hazards from the field, aiding hazard-vulnerable allies such as Dondozo, Chansey, and Arceus-Dark. This provides stall teams with much more longevity, allowing them to outlast hazard setters such as defensive Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn. However, Giratina is unable to use Defog against Taunt Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Tera Fairy allows Giratina to check Palkia-O and non-Sludge Bomb Eternatus more efficiently while enabling it to emergency check the rare Zekrom and force it out with Dragon Tail.</li> <li>Tera Poison gives Giratina a resistance to Fairy as well as a useful immunity to Toxic and the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, allowing it to effectively check Arceus-Fairy and defensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Giratina is useful early-game to scout Primal Groudon sets so that Dondozo isn’t sniped by Eruption or Overheat. Thanks to its ability to check every Primal Groudon set, Dondozo is free to preserve its HP to check threats such as Mega Salamence and Arceus.</li> <li>Throughout the game, Giratina is an excellent setup disruptor with Dragon Tail. Against balance teams, Giratina should attempt to stay on the field and spread chip damage against foes by using Toxic and then Dragon Tail on Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Against Choice Band Rayquaza, Giratina can be sacrificed in order to waste four of Dragon Ascent’s PP if necessary, although it should not directly switch into Rayquaza.</li> <li>Giratina is easily set up on by Zacian-C, as Giratina cannot phaze it with Dragon Tail or use Toxic on it. Dondozo is an excellent teammate, as it is one of the few Pokemon that counters Zacian-C thanks to Unaware. Giratina cannot deal with Ultra Necrozma after setup, so Arceus-Dark is an excellent teammate, as it is immune to Photon Geyser and heavily punishes setup with Foul Play.</li> <li>Taunt or Refresh Arceus-Fairy easily sets up on Giratina, while Eternatus can overwhelm Giratina with Dynamax Cannon, so Chansey makes a great teammate, as it is an excellent special wall to deal with these threats.</li> </ul>"

      "Physical Utility": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Giratina-O's great offensive typing, coupled with Levitate, allows it to reliably Defog against staple entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM; it is also able to check strong attackers including Extreme Killer Arceus, Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh. However, although its typing is excellent offensively, it leaves a bit to be desired defensively, since Giratina-O is weak to a lot of common types in the tier, which doesn't go well with Giratina-O's lack of reliable recovery. Regardless, these useful traits make Giratina-O a staple on bulky offense and balance teams alike.</li> <li>Dragon Tail prevents setup from opposing threats such as Arceus and Primal Groudon, which Giratina-O would otherwise struggle to slow down due to their natural bulk.</li> <li>Toxic punishes switch-ins such as Arceus-Fairy and Yveltal, as well as threatening defensive Primal Groudon that would handle Poltergeist more directly, making it the most consistent of the bunch because it will always be useful in a game. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, preventing Giratina-O from being too passive against the former, while Thunder Wave handles threats such as Eternatus and Calm Mind Arceus formes lacking Refresh.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak is a niche alternative that allows Giratina-O to revenge kill frailer foes such as Deoxys-A and Mega Mewtwo Y, but this comes at the cost of not being able to punish bulkier switch-ins like defensive Yveltal or Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>The following EV spread allows Giratina-O to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Salamence's Double Edge while 2HKOing defensive Necrozma-DM and offensive Eternatus with Poltergeist. An alternative EV spread can be used for Shadow Sneak variants, allowing Giratina-O to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike while ensuring a 3HKO on defensive Primal Groudon and an OHKO against offensive Necrozma-DM, both after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Giratina-O's typing is really important to the balance and bulky offense playstyles it fits on, so Terastallizing Giratina-O is only useful in emergencies. Tera Poison allows Giratina-O to gain a poison immunity while also providing a resistance to Fairy, which is useful versus Arceus-Fairy and Play Rough Zacian-C. Unlike Tera Steel, it avoids being weak to Fire and Fighting, preventing Giratina-O from being weak to Low Kick Marshadow and Overheat Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Tera Steel, however, grants a Rock resistance, which is useful versus Stone Edge Primal Groudon and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, while also letting Giratina-O handle Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Ultra Necrozma more comfortably. It also lets Giratina-O tank Dragon-type attacks from offensive Eternatus and phaze it away with Dragon Tail, removing its boosts and hitting it hard. However, it makes Giratina-O a riskier switch-in to Overheat and Heat Crash variants of Primal Groudon, as well as making it weak to Fighting-type moves from Marshadow and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Because Giratina-O cannot reliably heal, health management is very important, which includes avoiding status, such as poison from Ho-Oh. This is to ensure Giratina-O has enough HP to reliably check what it needs to, since it would otherwise be overwhelmed by boosted attacks from Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Against bulkier teams, it would be more beneficial for Giratina-O to use status moves such as Toxic or Thunder Wave to benefit its teammates more rather than attempting to deal damage with Poltergeist. This is because the status moves have better long-term impact against switch-ins like Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Fairy, while they would otherwise be able to just heal up any damage taken from Poltergeist. This is also why Toxic is generally the best option out of the three status moves, since it allows Giratina-O to make more progress versus Zygarde and Primal Groudon; the latter is a Pokemon Giratina-O should ordinarily check but can't due to its lackluster damage output against it.</li> <li>Due to Giratina-O's lack of healing, Alomomola is an excellent teammate for it, as it is able to pivot into Giratina-O against Pokemon that would otherwise take advantage of it, such as Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon, while also healing it up via Wish; Alomomola is also a great status absorber for Giratina-O, letting the latter avoid the residual damage it hates taking, such as Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire burns, while letting Giratina-O run status moves aside from Toxic such as Thunder Wave to better handle Zacian-C and Eternatus. Alomomola is also good at enabling Pokemon that Giratina-O appreciates, such as Chien-Pao, which threatens out Zygarde and Yveltal, and Ditto, which helps pressure out offensive sweepers such as Zacian-C and Meteor Beam Eternatus.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy makes up for Giratina-O's weaknesses to Dark-types including Yveltal and Arceus-Dark while handling Marshadow and switching into opposing Dragon-type attacks from Palkia-O to preserve Giratina-O's health. Stealth Rock variants are especially appreciated, since Giratina-O can abuse hazards well with Dragon Tail. This also applies to other hazard setters including Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, both of which handle the Fairy-types that Giratina-O cannot deal with; the former also helps versus Primal Kyogre, which would chip Giratina-O down with Ice Beam.</li> <li>Offensive teammates such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM appreciate Giratina-O breaking down defensive walls such as Primal Groudon and defensive Necrozma-DM, while they in return handle the Dragon-, Fairy- and Ice-types that Giratina-O cannot handle, including Eternatus, Arceus-Fairy and Calyrex-I; the former also handles Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark.</li> </ul>"

      "Special Utility": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Thanks to its excellent typing paired with Levitate, Giratina-O serves as an excellent Defogger on bulky offense structures and checks common threats such as Primal Groudon, Coil Zygarde, and Arceus. With a Specially Offensive set, Giratina-O is able to more immediately threaten Primal Groudon and Zygarde while dealing much more damage to Yveltal and Eternatus. Giratina-O can also fit on balance structures with Alomomola's Wish support due to the amazing role compression it offers. Giratina-O needs Alomomola support in order to offset its longevity issues and survive for the longer games balance teams tend to have.</li> <li>Giratina-O's choice of status determines what it is able to cripple long-term and what it cannot deal with. The status selection highly depends on the team composition Giratina-O finds itself on. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are strong into offense, while Toxic can help break down Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh balances. Will-O-Wisp is able to cripple threats such as Zacian-C, Arceus, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Thunder Wave is able to deal with Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Eternatus by allowing teammates such as Marshadow and Eternatus to outspeed these threats. Toxic chips down Ho-Oh, Zygarde, Primal Groudon, and support Arceus formes, allowing allies such as Zacian-C and Marshadow more easily sweep late-game. However, Toxic sets greatly struggle with Zacian-C, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Calm Mind Arceus formes running Tera Poison.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Primal Groudon's Eruption and Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike after Stealth Rock. In addition, it guarantees a 2HKO on Eruption Primal Groudon with Draco Meteor. Giratina-O can invest 12 Speed EVs to outspeed paralyzed Zacian-C, though this means defensive EVs must be sacrificed. The second EV spread allows Giratina-O to survive a +3 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C, a +2 Stone Edge from Primal Groudon, a Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse, and a Tera Ghost Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball from full HP. It also is highly likely that Arceus-Dark's Foul Play is a 3HKO. In addition, Hex 3HKOes Coil Zygarde after status and Draco Meteor 2HKOed utility Swords Dance Primal Groudon, and Giratina-O can outspeed uninvested Zygarde and paralyzed Zacian-C.</li> <li>A well-timed Terastallization is extremely powerful with Giratina-O. Tera Poison allows Giratina-O to tank any +3 attack from Zacian-C or Dynamax Cannon from Eternatus. This allows Giratina-O to deliver a devastating Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave to cripple these threats for the rest of the game. In addition, it is useful to check Marshadow, offensive Eternatus, and non-Taunt Arceus-Fairy. The poison immunity also gives Giratina-O much more longevity against bulky balance and stall structures.</li> <li>Tera Steel provides similar utility as Tera Poison such as tanking a hit from Zacian-C lacking Close Combat or defensive Eternatus while delivering a crippling status and gaining a poison immunity. Tera Steel is able to wall Arceus-Ground, Ultra Necrozma, defensive Eternatus, and Mega Salamence more efficiently. However, Giratina-O loses the ability to check Primal Groudon sets with Overheat or Eruption and is still vulnerable to offensive Eternatus with Fire Blast. In addition, Giratina-O becomes vulnerable to Close Combat from Zacian-C and Low Kick from Marshadow.</li> <li>Giratina-O serves as a Defogger and a reliable switch-in to all Primal Groudon sets on bulky offense, though it does not appreciate getting hit by Toxic. It is also valued for its status, allowing it to cripple threats such as Zacian-C and offensive Eternatus. Due to Giratina-O's limited longevity, it should be used sparingly early-game so that it has enough HP to fulfill these roles. As Zacian-C and Meteor Beam Eternatus can quickly run through defensive cores, Giratina-O should preserve its HP to cripple these threats with status in most cases. Teammates that have better longevity such as Arceus-Fairy and Calm Mind Arceus-Dark should be used to scout sets from threats such as Yveltal early-game. In addition, Coil Zygarde and Primal Groudon are appreciated to check physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Marshadow early-game. Giratina-O also appreciates offensive teammates such as Marshadow and Dragon Dance Zygarde.</li> <li>Giratina-O does not have the longevity to fit well on most balance structures, but Alomomola patches Giratina-O's longevity issues with Wish. This allows Giratina-O to be more aggressive in checking threats such as Primal Groudon and Zygarde early-game. In addition, Alomomola is able to easily use Toxic against Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, allowing Giratina-O to drop Toxic to better check Zacian-C and Eternatus. However, this core struggles against Calm Mind Arceus formes, so Pokemon such as Taunt Arceus-Fairy, Fezandipiti, and defensive Eternatus are essential.</li> <li>Giratina-O struggles massively against Taunt + Calm Mind Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Fairy. Therefore, Pokemon such as Zacian-C make excellent teammates. Giratina-O also struggles against specially offensive Yveltal, so Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, Fezandipiti, defensive and Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, and Heavy-Duty Boots defensive Eternatus are great allies. Giratina-O is able to cripple threats such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground lacking Taunt with status moves. Giratina-O can become setup fodder to defensive Primal Kyogre, so Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and defensive Primal Groudon are useful teammates. In exchange, Giratina-O checks opposing Primal Groudon that threaten them. Giratina-O is also bad into stall and walled by Chansey. Therefore, Defensive Kyogre is a great teammate.</li> </ul>"

Due to these qualities, it can set Trick Room on powerful wallbreakers such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and even Yveltal.</li> <li>Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to keep momentum for the team after setting Trick Room. Its ability to restore PP allows teammates such as Melmetal and Calyrex-I to wallbreak mid-game without worrying about the PP of their STAB moves late-game.</li> <li>Magic Coat prevents foes such as Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon from setting up entry hazards. If Cresselia's Mental Herb is used up, Magic Coat can be useful to deny threats such as Arceus-Ground and Yveltal from using Taunt, although it is a risky choice against the latter.</li> <li>Toxic is useful to deal chip damage to walls such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Dark, and Giratina-O. This allows Melmetal and Calyrex-I to wallbreak past these checks more easily. Alternatively, Future Sight can produce similar pressure and makes switching in harder for the opponent, being able to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh after Choice Band Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance and defensive Primal Groudon after Tera Ice Choice Band Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from a fully powered Primal Kyogre's Water Spout, Double Dance Primal Groudon's Heat Crash after Stealth Rock, +3 Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, +2 Tera Ghost Arceus's Shadow Claw, and Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse or Knock Off.</li> <li>Tera Water allows Cresselia to set Trick Room on +2 Heat Crash Primal Groudon, although this is a dead Tera slot otherwise and is wasted if the opposing Primal Groudon isn't carrying Heat Crash. Therefore, Cresselia should not use Tera often, as teammates such as Melmetal and Calyrex-I need it to wallbreak.</li> <li>Cresselia is best used as a mid- to late-game setter. Due to its great bulk, Cresselia can usually switch in for a teammate once Trick Room ends, tank a couple of hits from threats like Arceus and Primal Groudon, and set Trick Room. Cresselia switches in for Melmetal especially well, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks directed at Melmetal thanks to Levitate.</li> <li>When Cresselia is up against Pokemon that cannot 2HKO it such as defensive Primal Groudon and Arceus Ground, it may be best to first use Toxic or Future Sight in order to weaken them for teammates. This should not be done against Zygarde, however, as it can wall Calyrex-I and Melmetal with Tera Water after a Coil. When entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn are on the field, it may be best for Cresselia to use Magic Coat first to punish attempts to set Spikes.</li> <li>Pokemon that appreciate Trick Room support on top of PP restoration such as Melmetal and Calyrex-I make excellent teammates. Calyrex-I specifically greatly appreciates Cresselia keeping off Stealth Rock with Magic Coat.</li> <li>Cresselia needs support in setting Trick Room, as usually it is only able to set one round of it. As a result, additional setters such as Hatterene and Arceus are great teammates.</li> </ul>"

Recover is another alternative that allows Arceus to stay healthy while taking weaker hits from foes like Ferrothorn and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Silk Scarf is the preferred item, as it increases the power of Extreme Speed, letting +2 Arceus OHKO foes like wallbreaker Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma. Life Orb augments the power of all Arceus's moves; for example, at +2 it can OHKO offensive variants of Yveltal and Eternatus with Extreme Speed, though it gets worn down faster by the recoil damage.</li> <li>The given EV spread maximizes Arceus's Attack while letting it outspeed 252 Speed EV Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre with a neutral nature, with the remaining EVs being dumped into HP to maximize its bulk.</li> <li>Tera Ghost providing an immunity to Arceus's only weakness in Fighting as well as Normal can give it an extra turn against foes such as Marshadow, Zacian-C, and opposing Arceus. It also increases the power of Shadow Claw against Ghost-types, notably giving it good odds to OHKO Giratina-O at +2 and always letting it do so with Life Orb. However, this leaves Arceus more vulnerable to Marshadow's Shadow Sneak and Dark-types that can tank Extreme Speed like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Tera Normal increases the power of Extreme Speed and Double Edge to unspeakable levels, giving the former a chance to OHKO foes such as bulky Primal Kyogre and defensive Ho-Oh when boosted by Life Orb at +2, while the latter OHKOing defensive Zygarde.</li> <li>Tera Fire is niche, but it lets Arceus become immune to burn and resist Fire, notably helping it when faced with Ho-Oh.

Second, it acts as a deterrent, dissuading these threats from setting up until Arceus-Dark has been sufficiently weakened.</li> <li>Toxic is the preferred status move for Arceus-Dark, primarily to cripple common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Fairy. Will-O-Wisp presents a viable alternative for hitting Zacian-C and Marshadow, which is particularly relevant given Zacian-C's resistance to Foul Play.</li> <li>Refresh is a solid choice when Arceus-Dark is utilized as a primary Knock Off and status absorber for the team, since it can reliably  switch into Toxic Yveltal or Eternatus. However, in other scenarios, it's not recommended since it would render Arceus-Dark too passive against the aforementioned threats.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Dark to greatly limit most of the entry hazard setters in the tier, namely Primal Groudon, Defensive Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, it can neutralize status spreaders like Toxic Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Giratina-Origin, while also restricting the former's ability to use Defog. Taunt Arceus-Dark is also one of the best checks to Zygarde-C, as it can completely shut down its ability to spread paralysis and set up.</li> <li>Defog serves as a good filler move when Arceus-Dark acts as hazard control over common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Stealth Rock can be a viable option to free up teammates to fulfill other roles; for example, it alows Primal Groudon to run more offensive sets such as Swords Dance, or fit Spikes on defensive set. In addition, Arceus-Dark's typing and movepool allow it to set up Stealth Rock on common Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and most opposing Arceus formes, all of which are threatened by Arceus-Dark's status moves.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark's EV spread enables it to be faster than common base 90 Speed foes and also facilitates its role as a revenge killer against offensive Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, investing in Speed with EVs of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe and a Timid nature allows Arceus-Dark to outspeed Pokémon like Yveltal, Zekrom, and Rayquaza, and still survive a Life Orb Low Kick from Marshadow.</li> <li>Tera Poison lets Arceus Dark acts as an emergency check to boosted Marshadow and Tera Fighting Zacian-C, making it possible to safely revenge kill them. Moreover, by becoming a Poison-type, Arceus-Dark becomes immune to Toxic, making it possible for non-Taunt versions to beat Toxic Yveltal one-on-one. However, Tera Poison makes Arceus-Dark extremely vulnerable to Photon Geyser Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Deoxys-A, thus trainers should think twice before Terastallizing Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Utility Arceus-Dark is an excellent fit for balance and defensive teams, offering a check to Zygarde-C and and other common physical sweepers such as Ultra Necrozma. Depending on the set used, some precautions should be taken with Arceus-Dark. Non-Refresh sets need to scout for Toxic before switching into Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Similarly, it is important to scout for Glare Zygarde since Arceus-Dark doesn't enjoy being paralyzed.</li> <li>Stealth Rock from Arceus-Dark itself or a teammate  like Primal Groudon can wear down Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy that can switch into Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Since Necrozma-DM, the premier Toxic absorber of the tier, is heavily threatened by Foul Play, Arceus-Dark can often freely use Toxic on a predicted switch-in.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Arceus can overwhelm Arceus-Dark. To improve its matchup against these threats, teammates like Zygarde-C, Ferrothorn, and Ditto can provide valuable support.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Groudon serves as a great partner for Arceus-Dark, threatening Eternatus, which walls Arceus-Dark. A similar role is accomplished by Ho-Oh, especially sets carrying Thunder Wave, which can make Arceus-Dark faster than it. Additionally, Ho-Oh appreciates Arceus-Dark's ability to deal with Knock Off Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is another partner that benefits from Arceus-Dark's ability to cripple Primal Groudon and Yveltal, and it provides a Fairy resistance and Toxic immunity in return.</li> <li>Cleric support from Pokemon such as Magearna and Chansey can mitigate non-Refresh Arceus-Dark's weakness to status conditions.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Dark is an appealing option for balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate the role compression this set is able to provide. Arceus-Dark provides these teams with a sturdy win condition, a special wall, and a counter to Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and specially offensive Yveltal.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark has some flexibility in its fourth moveslot. Refresh enables Arceus-Dark to shrug off status and enables a stronger mid-game presence, as it is able to switch into Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Ho-Oh with impunity. Refresh also enables Arceus-Dark to position itself for a sweep more easily, as it is not hampered by Toxic.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Dark to easily shut down much of the defensive metagame and set up on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Zygarde, but it has to come in cautiously, as status conditions such as Toxic poison and paralysis from Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Zygarde heavily impede its ability to sweep prior to Terastallizing.</li> <li>4 Defense and 96 Speed EVs enable Arceus-Dark to survive Choice Band Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance and outspeed Chi-Yu. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense, which enables Arceus-Dark to better function as a special wall. This is particularly important against specially offensive Yveltal, as Arceus-Dark is easily able to shrug off Oblivion Wing as opposed to being forced to use Recover. This investment also enables Arceus-Dark to use Meteor Beam Eternatus as setup fodder, as it can withstand the combination of Meteor Beam followed by +1 Dynamax Cannon.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark's Tera type depends on whether it opts to run Refresh or Taunt. As Refresh Arceus-Dark does not have to worry about status, the defensive utility of Fairy is preferred. Tera Fairy enables Arceus-Dark to still check specially defensive Yveltal while also countering Palkia-O, as it is no longer concerned about Spacial Rend's critical hits; it also provides an immunity to attempts to phase it with Dragon Tail from Pokemon such as Giratina-O. Taunt Arceus-Dark opts for Tera Poison due to the poison immunity, as Toxic prevents it from sweeping; Tera Poison also provides additional utility by absorbing Eternatus's Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Against balance and bulky offense teams, Calm Mind Arceus-Dark is often used mid-game to defensively check Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Zygarde. As the opposing team is worn down, Arceus-Dark often finds itself in a position late-game to start boosting and sweep.</li> <li>As Arceus-Dark requires multiple boosts to become offensively threatening, it is often unable to sweep but plays an essential defensive role by checking Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and specially offensive Yveltal. Arceus-Dark's role against stall teams is heavily dependent on whether it opts to use Refresh or Taunt. If running Refresh, Arceus-Dark is an excellent pivot and status sponge that is capable of sweeping once Chansey is removed. Taunt Arceus-Dark has a more active role in stallbreaking, often utilizing Tera Poison and Taunt to preserve progress.</li> <li>Zygarde is the best teammate for Arceus-Dark. As Arceus-Dark invests in Special Defense, it relies on Zygarde to check physically offensive threats that it itself is unable to such as Marshadow, Zacian-C, and Primal Groudon. In return, Arceus-Dark checks Pokemon that overwhelm Zygarde such as Eternatus and specially offensive Yveltal. Arceus-Dark also appreciates Defog and status support from Giratina-O and Ho-Oh in addition to their ability to check Primal Groudon and Zacian-C, respectively.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark can struggle against other Calm Mind Arceus formes, especially Arceus-Fairy. Consequently, physical attackers such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are good teammates. Their ability to offensively check defensive Primal Kyogre is appreciated, as Arceus-Dark struggles to beat it without Taunt.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Fairy can perform a wide variety of defensive roles thanks to its Fairy typing, solid stats, wide movepool, and a nice Speed tier. It is able to switch into multiple top threats of the metagame such as Mega Salamence, Yveltal, Zygarde, Arceus-Dark, and Marshadow and cripple them with various options or set Stealth Rock as they're forced out, enabling it to fit in balance and defensive team structures.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Fairy to prevent setup, recovery, entry hazards, hazard control via Defog, and crippling status moves such as Glare and Toxic from Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Zygarde, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O. This move isn't recommended on specially defensive variants, as it's relatively easy for foes, such as some variants of the Pokemon listed above, to outspeed Arceus-Fairy, thus rendering most of Taunt's purposes niche.</li> <li>Toxic complements Judgment to cripple foes that can easily switch into it, including Ho-Oh, Arceus-Ground, and Primal Groudon, Will-O-Wisp alternatively allows Arceus-Fairy to cripple the Poison- and Steel-types it lures in, such as Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus, while also creating an easier matchup against multiple physical attackers such as Terastallized Zygarde and Marshadow.</li> <li>Stealth Rock forces progress for Arceus-Fairy's team, as it forces out relevant hazard removers such as Yveltal and Giratina-O. With Stealth Rock active, Arceus-Fairy has high odds to OHKO Ultra Necrozma and Palkia-O with Judgment.</li> <li>Given Arceus-Fairy can often stay in on common hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, if Arceus-Fairy has Toxic, and opposing support Arceus formes, it can act as a viable Defogger.</li> <li>Refresh increases Arceus-Fairy's longevity and consistency at checking foes, reducing the potential risk of switching into Glare from Zygarde and Toxic from Ho-Oh, Arceus-Dark, and Primal Groudon. It also renders special sets of Giratina-O unable to do much in return, as Hex does poor damage without a status condition.</li> <li>The given EV spread with a Bold nature allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Primal Groudon to better facilitate using Taunt and Recover, with the rest of the EVs being placed in Defense to render it as physically bulky as possible, letting it avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Poltergeist.</li> <li>Alternatively, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 108 SpD / 16 Spe with a Calm nature lets Arceus-Fairy avoid a 2HKO from Palkia-O's Hydro Pump and Primal Groudon's Overheat and a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Spectral Thief after Stealth Rock, and it can outspeed uninvested Primal Groudon. Additionally it also allows Arceus-Fairy to check Mega Mewtwo Y, and after Terastallizing to the Poison-type, Eternatus. This spread, however, has the flaws of being easier to overwhelm by physical attackers and vulnerability to Taunt from Pokemon such as other defensive Arceus formes and Terastallized Yveltal.</li> <li>Tera Water lets Arceus-Fairy more comfortably wall foes such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, in turn allowing Arceus-Fairy to cripple them with a status condition. Arceus-Fairy also gains a resistance to Palkia-O's Hydro Pump, granting it the momentum to greatly damage it even if it uses its physically defensive spread.</li> <li>Tera Poison increases Arceus-Fairy's longevity by giving it an immunity to Toxic and removing its weaknesses to Steel- and Poison-type moves, letting it switch into Zacian-C, Eternatus without Meteor Beam, Giratina-O, Arceus-Dark, and opposing Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is a Pokemon that does not Terastallize often, as its innate typing already provides the option to act as a wall for a good portion of the metagame, and its allies often make better use of it.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy's Judgment is often easy to switch into early- to mid-game, so most of the time utility moves are used instead for consistency and to continue making progress by crippling the other team.</li> <li>Depending on the moveset, Arceus-Fairy can't respond to foes that resist Judgment such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM; therefore, it appreciates Pokemon that can answer them, which include Giratina-O, Primal Kyogre, and Marshadow.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy's bulk can be lacking on one side depending on its EV spread. Physically defensive variants can struggle against Palkia-O, Eternatus, and Arceus formes with Calm Mind, so it appreciates checks to them to complement its own defensive attributes like Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon. Meanwhile, specially defensive variants can have notable difficulties checking physical sweepers, which include Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence and Arceus, so Pokemon that can switch into them such as Giratina-O and Necrozma-DM are appreciated.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy is an excellent bulky setup sweeper and wincon due to its excellent stats across the board, Fairy typing, and extensive coverage. Due to these qualities, it fits on a multitude of playstyles such as hyper offense, bulky offense, and balance.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp allows Arceus-Fairy to easily set up on Arceus, physical Arceus-Ground, and Mega Salamence lacking Facade. Power Gem is an option to hit Ho-Oh for meaningful damage. Taunt can be used to prevent Giratina-O, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh from crippling Arceus-Fairy with status such as Toxic or Thunder Wave and phazing it with Roar or Whirlwind. In addition, Taunt blocks Glare from Zygarde. Earth Power allows Arceus-Fairy to hit Primal Groudon, Eternatus, and Steel-types like Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>The given EV spread invests enough Speed for Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. The rest is invested into Defense and HP, giving Arceus-Fairy a high chance to survive a +2 Precipice Blades from Double Dance Primal Groudon while also avoiding an OHKO from Deoxys-A’s Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock and a 2HKO from Marshadow’s Poltergeist. The alternative EV spread with a Timid nature allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Modest Palkia-O and avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow’s Spectral Thief after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Tera Dark provides Arceus-Fairy with a Psychic immunity, helping its team against powerful attacks such as Light That Burns the Sky from Ultra Necrozma, Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A, and Psystrike from Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Tera Poison provides Arceus-Fairy a valuable immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes, allowing it to serve as the team’s Toxic Spikes absorber and check to opposing Arceus-Fairy and Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Ground ensures that Earth Power 2HKOes defensive Primal Groudon at +0 and gives it a chance to 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM at +1.</li> <li>On hyper offense, Arceus-Fairy is an excellent late-game wincon against a weakened team when checks such as Ho-Oh and Eternatus have been removed. On bulky offense and balance, Arceus-Fairy serves as an excellent check to Marshadow, Yveltal, and unboosted Mega Salamence throughout the game. It should not be afraid to switch into attacks from the aforementioned Pokemon, as any damage can be healed off with Recover. Arceus-Fairy must be wary of Toxic from Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O, which can heavily undermine its ability to sweep.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy’s sweeping ability is often hampered due to it being outsped by common threats such as Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Deoxys-A. For hyper offense, Sticky Web support from Shuckle flips these matchups and allows Arceus-Fairy to beat these checks. For bulky offense and balance, Thunder Wave support from Necrozma-DM eliminates this problem. Arceus-Fairy also appreciates duel screens support from Deoxys-S or Grimmsnarl, as this eases setup.</li> <li>Regardless of what is chosen in the fourth moveslot, Arceus-Fairy will always suffer from a lack of coverage, as having Power Gem means it struggles against Primal Groudon, and having Earth Power means it cannot break past Ho-Oh. Teammates that can cover these vulnerabilities such as Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma are helpful. Gothitelle is also a good teammate, as it effectively traps and removes walls such as Tera Steel Giratina-O, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh.</li> </ul>"

The second EV spread with a Timid nature outspeeds neutral-natured base 120 Speed foes including Palkia-O and Mega Salamence and avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Spectral Thief after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Tera Dark allows Arceus-Fairy to beat Psychic-types such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y one-on-one and become immune to status moves from the niche Grimmsnarl, all while retaining a Dark resistance to still handle foes such as Yveltal and Chien-Pao.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be used primarily as a wall early- to mid-game, as the need to use Calm Mind several times to break past Fairy-resistant foes makes it setup fodder for foes such as Double Dance Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy can often brute force past bulky foes such as Terastallized Coil Zygarde, Primal Kyogre, and defensive Primal Groudon thanks to its high longevity, but it should be careful to preserve its Judgment and Recover PP.</li> <li>While Arceus-Fairy acts as a good status absorber for its team thanks to Refresh, a turn is required to use it, which can often lead to scenarios where the opponent exploits this detail to safely bring in an offensive check against Arceus-Fairy. Therefore, it sometimes may be desirable to not immediately use Refresh after being subject to a status condition.</li> <li>As Arceus-Fairy can struggle with Fairy-resistant foes such as opposing Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM, often limiting its potential against bulky team structures.

        "description": "<ul> <li>Flying-type Judgment is what differentiates Arceus-Flying from other Arceus formes like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dark at its bulky sweeper role, since Flying-resistant Pokemon are much less common in the tier. Its immunity to Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes is also a distinct advantage, with the former immunity being especially useful against hyper offense structures. However, the lack of notable resistances makes it somewhat difficult for Arceus-Flying to reliably set up against strong attackers, especially since many outspeed Arceus-Flying such as Marshadow and Zacian-C, and a weakness to Stealth Rock means that it lacks defensive utility for the bulky offense and hyper offense teams it fits best on, meaning it suffers heavy competition from other Flying-types like Mega Salamence and Yveltal.</li> <li>Refresh allows Arceus-Flying to play more aggressively, avoiding the risk of coming into Toxic from Alomomola or Ho-Oh and even Glare from Zygarde. Alternatively, Taunt stops Arceus-Flying from being passive as it sets up against Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, prevents Ho-Oh from using Whirlwind against it, and limits the progress made by Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and support Arceus formes by restricting their entry hazard and status-spreading abilities.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Flying to avoid the 2HKO from physical utility Giratina-O's Poltergeist and the OHKO from offensive support Primal Groudon's Overheat, all while 2HKOing Tera Grass Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Tera Steel allows Arceus-Flying to remove its Ice and Rock weaknesses, potentially letting it set up on Pokemon like Chien-Pao, changes its Stealth Rock weakness into a resistance, and grants it a Toxic immunity, which is very useful for the less aggressive Taunt variants. Tera Fairy removes these weaknesses too alongside granting a Dark resistance, letting Arceus-Flying handle Yveltal and Arceus-Dark better and using Taunt to stop the latter from using recovery options, while keeping its Fighting resistance against Marshadow.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying is best used mid- or late-game when the opposing team has been broken down enough so that it can clean up after one or two boosts. It should be careful about being statused though, since Taunt variants have no way to remove status, and Refresh variants have to take a turn to remove them, which could lead to the opponent getting a free opportunity to bring in a Pokemon that checks Arceus-Flying such as Zacian-C.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying struggles greatly against Flying-resistant foes, and, although there are few in number, Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and the more niche Zekrom and Garganacl can all be problems for Arceus-Flying. Ground-types like Primal Groudon and Zygarde can help Arceus-Flying break through these foes, while Arceus-Flying can switch into Ground-type moves for the former.</li> <li>Strong physical wallbreakers such as Marshadow, Ultra Necrozma, and the aforementioned Primal Groudon help Arceus-Flying break through special walls like Ho-Oh and Chansey, while Arceus-Flying helps to break through physical walls like Zygarde and support Arceus formes. Gothitelle is able to trap and use Taunt to remove the majority of defensive switch-ins Arceus-Flying has like Chansey, Ho-Oh, and defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Entry hazard support from Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Eternatus can greatly assist Arceus-Flying in wallbreaking, notably letting it 2HKO offensive Primal Kyogre at +1 after Stealth Rock damage. Hazard control from Giratina-O or Ho-Oh is also appreciated to help alleviate Arceus-Flying's Stealth Rock weakness. Suicide leads like Glimmora and Smeargle can do both of these roles, making them good options for hyper offense builds.</li> </ul>"

Brick Break and Extreme Speed give Arceus-Ghost nearly unresisted coverage, with both moves being useful for cleaning up weakened foes during a sweep without needing to resort to the awkward Shadow Force, while still being able to use utility moves such as Taunt and Recover, distinguishing it from Marshadow. However, Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark are major issues for Arceus-Ghost, especially since its coverage options are quite weak, and Marshadow can revenge kill it after minor chip. Additionally, Arceus-Ghost faces competition from Arceus-Ground and Ultra Necrozma as a sweeper or wallbreaker on hyper offense teams, especially since Arceus-Ghost lacks a lot of defensive utility due to its poor resistances barring coming into Extreme Speed from opposing Arceus.</li> <li>Dragon Dance allows Arceus-Ghost to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, including Deoxys-A and Marshadow, both of which would revenge kill it with ease. Dragon Dance boosts Attack, letting Arceus-Ghost OHKO Ho-Oh, defensive Primal Kyogre and offensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock with Never-Ending Nightmare after a boost, while being able to OHKO Zygarde, support Arceus formes, and defensive Primal Groudon at +2.</li> <li>While Shadow Force is ran for its strength, which allows Arceus-Ghost to have a good roll to OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM and Rayquaza after a boost, its two-turn nature makes it awkward to use against teams with Dark-types like Arceus-Dark and Yveltal and Normal-types like Extreme Killer Arceus. To this end, running Ghostium Z removes this issue entirely via Never-Ending Nightmare providing a one-turn nuke for Arceus-Ghost against its desired targets. Shadow Force also allows Arceus-Ghost to defeat Ditto by itself, since Ditto will always outspeed and therefore will never hit Arceus-Ghost if they both use Shadow Force at the same time.</li> <li>Taunt allows Arceus-Ghost to set up on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Zygarde, limiting the latter's effectiveness as a check. Alternatively, Recover lets Arceus-Ghost set up on bulky attackers such as defensive Primal Groudon while keeping itself healthy, although it has to be more wary about status conditions inflicted by moves like Toxic from Pokemon such as Alomomola and Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Brick Break gives Arceus-Ghost a way of hitting Arceus-Dark and Extreme Killer Arceus for super effective damage, 2HKOing the latter at +1 after Stealth Rock while also removing opposing screens from Deoxys-S and Grimmsnarl. Extreme Speed gives Arceus-Ghost a way of revenge killing faster threats like Chien Pao and Deoxys-A without any boosts while limiting Sucker Punch Yveltal's ability to revenge kill it.</li> <li>The first given EV spread allows Arceus-Ghost to avoid the OHKO from Tera Ghost Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak, while maximum Speed investment lets Arceus-Ghost Speed tie with Modest Palkia-O and Adamant Mega Salamence, letting Arceus-Ghost avoid taking hits from them with Shadow Force, although this may be problematic against Substitute variants of the former. The Attack EVs allow Arceus-Ghost to OHKO Double Dance Primal Groudon with its Z-Move after a boost. Alternatively, the second EV spread avoids the OHKO from the previously mentioned Choice Band Tera Ghost Marshadow's Shadow Sneak—now after Stealth Rock—as well as Tera Flying Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and fully invested Primal Groudon's Overheat; however, it also makes Arceus-Ghost significantly slower, with it now being unable to outspeed fully invested Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, although it does still outspeed Deoxys-A after a boost.</li> <li>After setting up, the Z-Move is best used on bulkier targets such as defensive Primal Groudon, Zygarde, and support Arceus formes rather than frailer targets such as Mega Mewtwo Y. It is better to try to avoid using the boosted Z-Move just for the sake of hitting in one turn against Pokemon that aren't defensive walls, since said defensive walls will become significantly harder to break through.</li> <li>Unboosted Never-Ending Nightmare is still a strong option if Arceus-Ghost cannot set up, weakening opponents for teammates like Primal Kyogre and Eternatus to clean up more easily. If Dark-types like Arceus-Dark and Yveltal are present, then Arceus-Ghost should be used late-game when these two have been weakened so that Arceus-Ghost can pick them off with its coverage options.</li> <li>Arceus-Ghost struggles against Dark-types, so Fairy-types like Zacian-C can be effective to threaten them while wearing down shared checks like Primal Groudon. Eternatus is a good teammate, since it can reliably switch into Arceus-Dark and defensive Yveltal for Arceus-Ghost and can take down the latter with Meteor Beam. Marshadow forms a potent Ghost-spam combo with Taunt variants of Arceus-Ghost, with it dealing with Arceus-Dark and Yveltal with Low Kick while Arceus-Ghost breaks through defensive Pokemon like Zygarde for it.</li> <li>Specially offensive Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, Eternatus, and offensive Yveltal are great options for Arceus-Ghost, since they can assist in breaking through physical walls while Taunt variants of Arceus-Ghost are able to set up on special walls like Ferrothorn and Chansey while avoiding Leech Seed and Toxic; offensive Yveltal is also able to switch into Dark-type moves for Arceus-Ghost and can stop hazards from being removed, helping Arceus-Ghost wallbreak more easily.</li> <li>Suicide leads like Shuckle and Smeargle can set Sticky Webs Web for Arceus-Ghost to let it outspeed certain Pokemon unboosted such as Zacian-C and Eternatus. Glimmora can set up hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, which helps Arceus-Ghost break through defensive structures more easily with all the switches it encourages. Arceus-Ghost's natural ability to spinblock against Iron Treads is greatly appreciated across all suicide leads.</li> </ul>"

It typically fits best on bulky offense and balance teams.</li> <li>Calm Mind boosts Arceus's already-strong Special Attack and Special Defense. While the offensive upside is obvious, it is also valuable defensively. At +1, Arceus-Ground survives attacks such as defensive Primal Kyogre's Scald and Life Orb Deoxys-A's Ice Beam. Arceus-Ground can set up on Pokémon that it forces out such as Meteor Beam Eternatus and offensive utility Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Judgment hits key targets for super effective damage, such as OHKOing offensive Zacian-C, offensive Primal Groudon, and Meteor Beam Eternatus. Defensive Primal Groudon is OHKOed after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. At +1, Judgment threatens to 2HKO defensive Arceus sets, such as Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Water, along with securing the 2HKO on defensive Necrozma-DM. Also at +1, Judgment OHKOs defensive Primal Groudon and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM while 2HKOing offensive Primal Kyogre and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Ice Beam provides coverage for Flying-type Pokemon, OHKOing offensive Mega Salamence, Zygarde, and Rayquaza. It also 2HKOes offensive Yveltal sets and does good chip damage to Giratina-O.</li> <li>Power Gem also hits Flying-types for super effective damage, even if it misses out on hitting Dragon-types such as Giratina-O and Zygarde. One major benefit to running Power Gem, however, is hitting Ho-Oh. Defensive Ho-Oh walls Ice Beam variants but gets 2HKOed by Power Gem, forcing it to Terastallize if it wants to continue to wall Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Recover is used to prevent Arceus-Ground from getting worn down over the course of a game by healing off damage from entry hazards or weak moves such as Alomomola's Flip Turn. It can also be used to soft check certain attackers in a pinch, such letting Life Orb Marshadow chip itself down into range of Judgment, or helping Arceus-Ground beat defensive Primal Groudon and Eternatus more reliably.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread of 72 HP / 60 Def / 252 SpA / 124 Spe with a Modest nature can be used. This spread gives it an excellent matchup against Trick Room teams, as after Tera Water, it is 3HKOed by Choice Band Melmetal's Double Iron Bash and Choice Band Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, and it has enough offensive EVs to OHKO uninvested Eternatus with Judgment and OHKO uninvested Zygarde with Ice Beam. Without Tera, Arceus-Ground also survives two offensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strikes, and it can survive Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Eternatus after a layer of Spikes. The downside of using this spread comes primarily at the cost of lowering its Speed, letting it get outsped by maximum speed Arceus formes and Palkia-O.</li> <li>Tera Ground is used to bolster the offensive power of Judgment, turning defensive Necrozma-DM from a likely 2HKO after Leftovers to a guaranteed 2HKO. It also secures the OHKO against defensive Primal Groudon and turns specially defensive Eternatus from a 2HKO into a likely OHKO after hazard damage. It also allows Arceus-Ground to brute force past potential checks such as defensive Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Tera Water turns Arceus-Ground's weaknesses to Ice-type and Water-type moves into resistances, which allows it to beat defensive Primal Kyogre easily while also handling offensive variants, albeit less comfortably. Tera Water also flips the matchup against Calyrex-I, allowing Arceus-Ground to tank Glacial Lance.</li> <li>This Arceus-Ground set is best applicable to bulky offensive and balance teams. Its raw strength and good bulk allow it to come into the game multiple times to get setup opportunities. It enjoys hazard support from teammates such as Primal Groudon. Another option is Wish support, such as Alomomola, whose Wish and Flip Turn combination allows Arceus-Ground to be brought in against many of the tier's threats. Alomomola also serves as a status absorber for Arceus-Ground. Choice Band Rayquaza is another great partner to pivot Arceus-Ground into the game while also OHKOing wallbreaker Primal Kyogre. It also serves as a stallbreaker, a needed role on Arceus-Ground teams, as it struggles to break stall teams long-term.</li> <li>Other good partners for Arceus-Ground include strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Marshadow, whose strength allows it to break through special walls that Arceus-Ground may struggle to break through, such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes, and other special setup Pokemon such as Calm Mind Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul>"

      "Physical Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Physical Arceus-Ground is an excellent wallbreaker and sweeper on hyper and bulky offense teams. It easily finds turns to boost due to scaring out common Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Additionally, physical Arceus-Ground benefits from the presence of the more common defensive and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground sets, as it is able to beat switch-ins expecting to check other Arceus-Ground sets such as Primal Kyogre and Palkia-O.</li> <li>Dragon Dance is Arceus-Ground's primary boosting move. Alternatively, Swords Dance is a viable option, as Sticky Web support enables Arceus-Ground to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with the exception of specially offensive Yveltal.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground's last moveslot should be tailored to best support its team. On hyper offense teams, Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Yveltal from removing entry hazards while also protecting Arceus-Ground from status moves. Recover enables Arceus-Ground to perform the defensive duties expected of it on bulky offense teams, such as switching into Primal Groudon multiple times while remaining healthy enough to sweep late-game. Healing Wish is also an option on hyper offense teams to give a teammate such as Zacian-C or Ultra Necrozma a second chance at sweeping.</li> <li>As Ultra Necrozma is a staple on hyper offense teams, Arceus-Ground typically equips an Earth Plate. However, bulky offense teams appreciate Arceus-Ground's ability to OHKO Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and wallbreaker Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock with Tectonic Rage. Arceus-Ground's ability to OHKO defensive Primal Groudon and utility Arceus formes with Tectonic Rage after a Swords Dance is appreciated by many Sticky Web teams.</li> <li>The given EV spread maximizes Arceus-Ground's mixed bulk while allowing it to outspeed Primal Groudon and maximize damage output. This ensures that it outspeeds most of the defensive metagame and can revenge kill Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. The defensive investment prevents Arceus-Ground from being OHKOed by Necrozma-DM's Searing Sunraze Smash, Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost, and after a layer of Spikes, Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent, Choice Band Melmetal's Double Iron Bash, and Choice Specs Eternatus's Draco Meteor. Arceus-Ground also survives Tectonic Rage and +1 Tera Ground Earthquake from opposing Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Tera Ground enables Arceus-Ground to OHKO some targets without a boost, such as Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after a single layer of Spikes and defensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Tera Rock is an alternate option to OHKO switch-ins such as Mega Salamence switching in on a Dragon Dance after Stealth Rock with Stone Edge. At +1, Tera Rock Stone Edge OHKOes defensive Yveltal and 2HKOes Giratina-O after Stealth Rock. Tera Rock can also be used defensively to resist common priority move such as Arceus's and Rayquaza's Extreme Speed.</li> <li>On hyper offense teams, Arceus-Ground is best used as a mid-game wallbreaker to remove Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM. On bulky offense teams, it is best used early-game due to its positive matchups against both common hazard setters such as Primal Groudon and Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Arceus-Ground should be kept reasonably healthy, as it is often able to sweep late-game after a boost. It also struggles against stall teams, as it is walled by Dondozo and phazed by Giratina-O, though Taunt is disruptive to many stall teams.</li> <li>Shuckle is a great Sticky Web user to enable Swords Dance Arceus-Ground. Kyurem-B synergizes well with Arceus-Ground, as it is able to break through Dondozo and exploit Tera Grass Ho-Oh, which walls Arceus-Ground. Zacian-C also appreciates Arceus-Ground's efficacy in removing Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh while helping against Arceus-Dark. Specially offensive Yveltal is also a great partner that threatens most of the defensive metagame and dissuades Ditto from using Earthquake after copying Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>On bulky offense teams, utility Swords Dance Primal Groudon provides Stealth Rock support and a switch-in to Primal Kyogre, which scares out an unboosted Arceus-Ground. Choice Band Marshadow is an excellent teammate that is able to revenge kill Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and Zacian-C, which threaten a chipped Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Ground covers a wide variety of foes and utility roles, thanks to its solid mixed bulk and wide movepool. Its typing hits some of the most relevant threats in the metagame super effectively while also giving it few weaknesses and relevant resistances, allowing it to answer a variety of foes such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, and Yveltal and turning it into a versatile pick for a wide variety of team structures.</li> <li>Toxic allows Arceus-Ground to hinder switch-ins immune to Judgment like Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Yveltal; Ice Beam alternatively complements Judgment to hit all previously mentioned foes but Ho-Oh, as well as Zygarde, super effectively. Taunt prevents entry hazards from Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn, Defog from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, disruptive moves such as Glare, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp from Zygarde, Yveltal, and Giratina-O, and setup and recovery moves from Zygarde, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM, rendering them easier to beat.</li> <li>Stealth Rock provides general utility to support the rest of Arceus-Ground's team, helping wallbreaking allies such as Primal Groudon and Zacian-C to net more OHKOs as they force switches.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Marshadow's Low Kick after Stealth Rock and a 2HKO from Zacian-C's Play Rough after Intrepid Sword and Stealth Rock. The Speed investment ensures Arceus-Ground outspeeds fully invested Primal Groudon, and the remaining EVs are used on Special Attack to raise the odds to OHKO Zacian-C and Zekrom after Stealth Rock with Judgment.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground is a Pokemon that doesn't Terastallize often, as its allies usually make better use of the mechanic. Tera Poison renders it unable to check Ground-types such as Primal Groudon, opposing Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde and makes it weaker to Stealth Rock. However, Tera Poison raises the accuracy of Toxic, increases Arceus-Ground's longevity by making it immune to Toxic itself from foes such as Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal, enables it to wall further foes such as Marshadow and Eternatus, and lets it absorb Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, supporting its team with entry hazard control.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground's special bulk can be too lacking at times to handle foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Lunala; as such, it appreciates partners to make a defensive core with, such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Yveltal. Water-types such as Primal Kyogre, Palkia-O, and Arceus-Water can easily break past Arceus-Ground; therefore, it appreciates Pokemon on its side like Primal Groudon, Eternatus, and Ferrothorn to handle them.</li> <li>Wallbreakers that can break past foes Arceus-Ground can't do much against on its own are valuable to ease progress. For example, Zacian-C threatens Giratina-O and Mega Mewtwo Y for Arceus-Ground sets without Toxic, Primal Kyogre covers Ho-Oh and Zygarde for variants without both Ice Beam and Toxic, and Marshadow can make progress against Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Primal Groudon independently of Arceus-Ground's set, especially with Stealth Rock support from Arceus-Ground to wear down the other team.</li> </ul>"

It also greatly annoys common Rock-resistant Pokemon, such as Zygarde, Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Stealth Rock is a good option, since Arceus-Rock threatens common Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal, keeping it up consistently. Taunt lets Arceus-Rock deny foes' attempts to recover health or spread status. Refresh lets Arceus-Rock shrug off Toxic and burns from Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, and Arceus-Dark. Ice Beam can be ran in the third slot to lure in and catch Zygarde off guard.</li> <li>The given EV spread enables Arceus-Rock to avoid a 2HKO from specially offensive Yveltal's Dark Pulse, avoid an OHKO from +1 Adamant Mega Salamence's Earthquake after Stealth Rock, and almost always avoid an OHKO from +1 Life Orb Rayquaza's Earthquake while having enough Speed to outpace Chi-Yu. The rest of the EVs are invested to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Tera Rock lets Arceus-Rock fire off more powerful Judgments, notably letting it OHKO defensive Yveltal and 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon, offensive Eternatus, and offensive Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock, while retaining its ability to check Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. Tera Grass can also be used to turn its weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances, providing defensive insurance for Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock should be used aggressively to chip the opposing team with STAB Judgment, which is difficult to switch into, while burning the opposing Rock-resistant foes, such as Zacian-C and Marshadow, and pressuring common forms of hazard control. This role is expanded upon when facing Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence, in which case Arceus-Rock should be preserved to check these threats.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock appreciates teammates like Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus that cover its numerous weaknesses to common moves, such as Arceus-Ground's Earthquake and Kyogre's Origin Pulse, while they, in turn, appreciate Arceus-Rock's ability to check strong physical attackers like Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Running Stealth Rock on Arceus-Rock can allow Primal Groudon to run more offensive sets. Pokemon that appreciate Arceus-Rock burning Steel-types, such as Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Mega Salamence, are good partners, as they can set up more easily. Mega Salamence is especially good to pair with, as it checks Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre offensively and can use a burned Necrozma-DM lacking status moves as setup fodder.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock and Gothitelle make a good pairing, since Arceus-Rock can burn physical attackers such as Zygarde, Necrozma-DM, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground to make Gothitelle's trapping more consistent; in turn, Gothitelle takes out these Ground- and Steel-types that threaten Arceus-Rock.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Water's bulk, Speed, and utility combined with its Water typing give it a strong defensive presence in the metagame. The ability to check Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde with Judgment, as well as switch in on Primal Groudon and defensive Primal Kyogre, makes Arceus-Water an important defensive Pokemon for certain balance and bulky offense teams.</li> <li>Judgment is a reliable STAB option that deals decent damage to Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Zygarde while hitting Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground super effectively. Toxic cripples the longevity of opposing defensive Pokemon like support Arceus formes, Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Yveltal while also preventing Primal Kyogre from switching in freely, which would otherwise wall Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's positive matchup into Ho-Oh makes it a reliable Stealth Rock user, with Toxic limiting Giratina-O and support Arceus formes as well. Refresh removes any status conditions, notably bad poisoning from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O as well as paralysis from Necrozma-DM and Zygarde that would otherwise cripple Arceus-Water and limit its effectiveness at checking certain Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM. Taunt prevents foes from setting up on Arceus-Water for free, whether it be entry hazards or stat boosts from Pokemon like Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Coil Zygarde. Ice Beam is an alternative option to avoid being passive against Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza, which could all set up on Arceus-Water with ease, while also allowing Arceus-Water to OHKO Zygarde, but this comes at the cost of significantly limiting Arceus-Water's utility options.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Arceus-Water to always outspeed Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Zekrom while maximizing its physical bulk, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Marshadow's Poltergeist and Double Dance Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Tera Fairy provides a valuable Dark resistance, letting Arceus-Water handle Yveltal more comfortably while also providing a resistance to Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Marshadow as well as an immunity to Dragon-type moves from Giratina-O.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's great bulk and uncommon weaknesses allow it to come in on most neutral hits in the tier, including Mega Salamence's Double-Edge and Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser, making it a solid defensive pivot for its teammates. Running Refresh also enables Arceus-Water to switch in more recklessly against Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and opposing support Arceus formes without fear of any inflicted status conditions. However, Arceus-Water has significant four-moveslot-syndrome; if not running Judgment, it will struggle against Ho-Oh, while it will struggle against Primal Groudon if not running Taunt or Ice Beam. Alongside this, Arceus-Water's passive nature makes it prone to being set up on, especially against Pokemon like Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Eternatus, so it's ideal to have teammates such as Zygarde and Ho-Oh that can handle these threats.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are good partners to Arceus-Water, as they both can check Eternatus, which would be able to set up on Arceus-Water easily, while Arceus-Water can check Zygarde and defensive Primal Kyogre in return. Refresh Arceus-Water's ability to soak up status conditions, particularly from Ho-Oh, which can only use Toxic against it, is also greatly valued by Primal Groudon, which is prone to being worn down by Toxic; even without Refresh, Arceus-Water's ability to threaten Ho-Oh offensively with Judgment is handy.</li> <li>Dragon-types like Mega Salamence and Giratina-O can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type moves that threaten Arceus-Water, and in turn it can switch into the Ice-type moves they fear, such as Calyrex-Ice's Glacial Lance; they're both also able to check offensive Primal Groudon, which Arceus-Water is completely helpless against if not running Taunt or Ice Beam.</li> <li>Since Arceus-Water struggles to prevent Stealth Rock against Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, especially if not running Taunt, Defoggers such as Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal are needed to ensure Arceus-Water doesn't get worn down by hazards in longer games.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Water's excellent typing, supplemented by superb natural bulk, is attractive to balance teams looking for a sweeper that also contributes defensively as a switch-in to specially offensive Yveltal, a Pokemon balance teams lacking Arceus-Fairy notoriously struggle with, while also scaring out Ho-Oh.</li> <li>As Judgment, Calm Mind, and Recover are all mandatory, Arceus-Water only has one moveslot left for coverage. Unfortunately, there is no singular move that perfectly complements Judgment, leaving Arceus-Water reliant on teammates to handle certain Pokemon it does not have coverage for. Ice Beam enables Arceus-Water to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall it such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Giratina-O while ensuring Primal Groudon does not switch in freely. Alternatively, Earth Power heavily punishes Primal Groudon attempting to freely switch in on Judgment while preventing Arceus-Water from being walled by Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and opposing Arceus-Water.</li> <li>The given EV spread ensures that Arceus-Water outspeeds fully invested neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Furthermore, the high investment in bulk enables Arceus-Water to survive some monstrously powerful attacks including Basculegion's Last Respects after five fainted allies, +3 Zacian-C's Wild Charge, Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock, and Tera Flying Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent after Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes. Additionally, Arceus-Water avoids the 2HKO from Double Dance Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and Choice Band Marshadow's Low Kick.</li> <li>Though Arceus-Water rarely Terastallizes, it can still effectively utilize its Tera type in a pinch to help flip certain matchups or to facilitate a sweep. Tera Fairy transforms Arceus-Water from a passable to sturdy specially offensive Yveltal check while retaining a stellar defensive typing and becoming a good Marshadow check. Tera Poison is an alternate option that enables Arceus-Water to more consistently sweep bulkier balance teams. The newfound Toxic immunity enables Arceus-Water to switch into Ho-Oh and defensive Eternatus with impunity and use them as setup fodder. Absorbing Eternatus's Toxic Spikes has the added benefit of alleviating pressure on teammates to use Defog. However, Arceus-Water's new weakness to the omnipresent Ground-type attacks from Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground means that Tera Poison should be used cautiously.</li> <li>Arceus-Water excels against balance and bulky offense teams. It has a strong mid-game presence, as it prevents Ho-Oh, defensive Yveltal, and—if Arceus-Water runs Ice Beam—Giratina-O from freely removing entry hazards. However, Arceus-Water should do so cautiously, as all three commonly run Toxic, which can prevent Arceus-Water from sweeping in the end-game. Arceus-Water lacks the ability to make progress against stall teams and is overwhelmed by hyper offense teams due to a lack of power before boosting.</li> <li>As Arceus-Water has coverage issues regardless of whether it runs Ice Beam or Earth Power, it relies on teammates to fill these gaps. Zygarde is an excellent choice as a blanket physical wall that checks Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Rayquaza, and Mega Salamence. Zygarde also alleviates pressure on Arceus-Water defensively, which enables it to more consistently sweep. In return, Arceus-Water checks Taunt Arceus-Ground and specially offensive Yveltal, which shut down Zygarde. Ferrothorn is also an excellent teammate due to checking wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, which can easily run through many balance teams, especially if a Timid nature is used. Arceus-Water also appreciates offensive partners such as Choice Band Marshadow and specially offensive Yveltal, which thrive against the hyper offense and stall teams that Arceus-Water struggles with due to their ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> </ul>"

      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With access to Calm Mind and excellent base 120 stats across the board, Arceus-Water is able to act as a strong bulky setup sweeper.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's good typing allows it to break through defensive staples such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground while dealing great damage to Zygarde.</li> <li>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Water to 2HKO walls like Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon. Aside from boosting Arceus-Water's Special Attack, it also allows it to turn the tables on some switch-ins that typically check it such as Eternatus and Palkia-O; in conjunction with Recover, it provides Arceus-Water with the longevity needed to continuously take on strong special attacks from foes like Eternatus and offensive Yveltal in order to set up on them.</li> <li>Earth Power enables Arceus-Water to threaten foes that can take Water-type moves, 2HKOing Primal Groudon and Eternatus at +1. Grass Knot can also be used instead of Earth Power to hit heavy Water-types like Primal Kyogre, Palkia-O, and opposing Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's choice of Tera type is determined by the coverage move it runs. Tera Ground boosts Earth Power to muscle through Primal Groudon and Zacian-C with an OHKO on both at +1 whilst granting it an immunity to Electric-type attacks from Zekrom and Primal Kyogre. Tera Grass is used to power up Grass Knot, and at +1 it has a chance to OHKO Primal Kyogre and deal significant damage to Zygarde whilst resisting its Ground-type STAB moves and the aforementioned Electric-type Arceus-Water best fits on bulky and hyper offense teams that appreciate its great bulk and typing.</li> <li>It is preferable to use Arceus-Water early-game to blow holes into the opposing team's defensive core, as it can easily use Calm Mind on the likes of Ho-Oh and Zygarde and force progress, which is appreciated by teammates such as Necrozma-DM and offensive Primal Groudon. It also has good synergy with the aforementioned teammates, as it helps them beat physical walls like Zygarde and opposing Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Although Arceus-Water has good Special Attack, it struggles to beat special walls such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Giratina, so teammates like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Zacian-C are appreciated.</li> <li>Fairy-types like Zacian-C help Arceus-Water deal with Dragon-type foes, as it struggles to deal damage to foes such as Ultra Necrozma, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza. In return, Arceus-Water can beat foes such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for them.</li> </ul>"

      "Calm Mind + Refresh": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Water is already a potent sweeper by itself, and with the addition of Refresh, it can be almost impossible to stop once it gets going, beating traditional checks like Giratina-O and Eternatus. The one caveat of this set is its inability to hit Primal Groudon at all, requiring the team to be built around hitting it with Toxic or easily removing it. Furthermore, this set does not forgo Arceus-Water’s defensive utility, as it still checks Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh, and the set even expands on its utility with the addition of Refresh enabling it to become a status absorber.</li> <li>Calm Mind functions both as a defensive tool and an offensive one, letting Arceus-Water actually pressure Zygarde and Eternatus while also setting itself up for a sweep late-game.</li> <li>Refresh lets Arceus-Water shrug off Toxic from Ho-Oh and Eternatus, utilizing them as setup fodder, and freely pivot into Necrozma-DM without worrying about being statused.</li> <li>The given EV spread with a Timid nature lets Arceus-Water outspeed Modest Palkia-O and offensive Yveltal, allowing it to use Calm Mind or Recover before it can throw off an attack, with the remainder of the EVs dumped in Defense to maximize its defensive utility; this notably lets it avoid the KO from +2 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock and +1 Tectonic Rage from Arceus Ground.</li> <li>Tera Fairy gives Arceus-Water a better defensive typing that prevents it from being phazed by Dragon Tail Zygarde and Giratina-O, lets it swtch into non-Sludge Bomb Eternatus better, and prevents it from being forced out by non-Behemoth Blade Zacian-C. As Arceus-Water doesn't require Terastallizing often to sweep, Tera Fairy is mainly used to enhance its defensive role if it is unable to sweep, letting it check Life Orb Yveltal and Marshadow better.</li> <li>Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus-Water should always be paired with a teammate that can either lure or put immense pressure on Primal Groudon. Arceus-Water is best used mid- or late-game, as its defensive utility allows it to stave off threats like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and Palkia O, and it can sweep once Primal Groudon is poisoned or removed. If Primal Groudon cannot be removed or hit by Toxic easily, then Arceus-Water can be relegated to a more defensive role throughout the match and absorb status for its teammates safely; in a pinch, it can Tera to check a wider array of threats. Shuca Berry Eternatus is the most notable example, as it lures in Primal Groudon and poisons it, essentially allowing Arceus-Water to set up on it freely and win. Primal Kyogre is also a great partner, as it constantly forces in and pressures Primal Groudon and Eternatus, which can heavily annoy Arceus-Water. Zacian-C functions similarly to wear down Primal Groudon throughout a game or even outright remove it with Tera Blast Ground.</li> <li>Gothitelle is also a notable partner that can trap and remove defensive Primal Groudon lacking Overheat, but it struggles against offensive variants and defensive ones with Overheat. As such, additional support is needed alongside it, such as Toxic Spikes or Dragonium Z Eternatus. Zygarde is also great alongside Arceus-Water, as it checks Primal Groudon consistently while also appreciating Arceus-Water checking Kyogre and offensive Yveltal for it.</li> </ul>"

  "Gothitelle": {
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Gothitelle has a unique niche in National Dex Ubers. Its ability to trap and PP stall common walls such as Ho-Oh and most variants of Zygarde and deny setup from sweepers such as Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma can allow for unique team structures. The removal of these roadblocks greatly amplifies the offensive threat of Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, making Gothitelle a great member on bulky offense teams.</li> <li>Taunt prevents phazing from from Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Groudon from denying the trap, stops recovery moves from being used, and denies attempts to status Gothitelle, which can risk its longevity. Rest grants Gothitelle a way to recover from status conditions, such as Toxic and Sacred Fire burns from Ho-Oh, and restore its HP, lessening the reliance on Leftovers recovery. Charm is Gothitelle's most reliable way of decreasing the foe's damage output, such as Ho-Oh, defensive Primal Groudon, Zygarde and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Cosmic Power lets Gothitelle boost its physical bulk past what Charm allows and lets it tank weaker special moves, such as Dynamax Cannon from defensive Eternatus, more effectively. Substitute grants Gothitelle a temporary immunity to status, more Leftovers healing against Charm-weakened foes, and a safeguard against potential critical hits. It also prevents Dragon Tail from Zygarde and defensive Primal Groudon from phazing Gothitelle. Substitute does only have 16 PP, which means Gothitelle can have trouble PP stalling multiple targets, such as when trapping Brave Bird Ho-Oh and Rock Tomb defensive Primal Groudon. Toxic can be run to speed up the trapping process against defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh but is less consistent against more offensive teams.</li> <li>The first EV spread focuses on taking hits and being able to sponge the most damage, and it is more consistent due to being less susceptible to critical hits. The second EV spread lets Gothitelle outspeed uninvested base 90 Pokemon, including defensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde-C, and more effectively trap them; this allows it to use Charm or Taunt against them, reducing their damage output and denying attempts to status Gothitelle or recover HP. The remaining EVs are invested to maximise physical bulk. Gothitelle can also run an alternative EV spread with Special Defense investment, a Calm nature, and Confide, which can allow it to trap Eternatus and defensive Arceus formes lacking Taunt.</li> <li>Tera Water grants Gothitelle a resistance to Fire and Steel, allowing it to trap Ho-Oh, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Overheat variants of defensive Primal Groudon more consistently. Tera Fairy allows Gothitelle to trap Pokemon running Dragon Tail such as Zygarde while retaining the ability to run Cosmic Power. Gothitelle can also run Tera types to trap specific Pokemon, such as Tera Ghost to trap Chansey or Tera Steel to trap Eternatus.</li> <li>Gothitelle is paired with strong offensive Pokemon that only need a few walls taken out to sweep, so it often only needs to take out one or two foes to enable its partners to break through the opposing team. Zacian-C appreciates Gothitelle taking down Zygarde, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon, Eternatus appreciates it taking down Necrozma-DM, and many setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus formes appreciate Gothitelle's ability to take down Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Taunt or Charm should almost always be the first move that Gothitelle uses; Taunt should be used to block status moves, such as Ho-Oh’s Whirlwind and Toxic, or against Pokemon that commonly run stat boosting moves, such as Coil from Zygarde and Dragon Dance from Ultra Necrozma. Charm should be used to lower the Attack of Pokemon that have already boosted up, such as Coil Zygarde, or usually don’t carry any status moves such as Ultra Necrozma. It is important to use Rest after using Taunt to give the foe as few free turns as possible, and Gothitelle can use Taunt immediately after waking up.</li> <li>Scouting is crucial when using Gothitelle, as many foes that it aims to trap have ways to beat it. Gothitelle has to be wary of offensive variants of Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, as Gothitelle is 2HKOed, and Heat Crash from Double Dance Primal Groudon can OHKO it outright. Uncommon coverage on Dragon Dance sweepers such as Ultra Necrozma's X-Scissor or Outrage after Stealth Rock and Z-Moves such as +1 Tectonic Rage from Arceus-Ground or +1 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM also OHKO Gothitelle.</li> <li>Since Gothitelle only runs status moves, faster Taunt from Arceus and Yveltal completely shuts it down. Substitute also shuts down Gothitelle's attempts to lower the foe's stats, though it can still use Taunt to deny setup from Pokemon such as Zygarde.</li> <li>Gothitelle is susceptible to critical hits from Pokemon it aims to trap such as defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, which can lead to inconsistency at times. Therefore, it is important to keep Gothitelle at high HP with Rest, even when the foe's moves deals little damage, to keep it out of range of critical hits.</li> <li>Hyper offense teams should be prepared for, as Gothitelle has a poor matchup into the playstyle. Common hyper offense Pokémon such as Zacian-C and Mega Salamence have too much immediate power for Gothitelle to be able to trap, so it relies on teammates such as Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Ditto to handle the matchup. Gothitelle, however, is able to beat Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma. Gothitelle can also PP stall Swords Dance on Extreme Killer Arceus lacking Taunt, but this leaves it unable to trap any other Pokemon, since Swords Dance and Charm have an equal number of PP.</li> <li>Gothitelle shines when paired with strong offensive threats such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and offensive Arceus-Fairy that appreciate Gothitelle’s capability to trap and remove specific walls such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde lacking Substitute, and defensive Primal Groudon as well as common stall Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Dondozo. In turn, these offensive threats overwhelm hyper offensive Pokemon Gothitelle struggles against. Gothitelle's teammates can also use Charm-weakened foes as setup opportunities, since the foe's Attack is too low to deal sufficient damage back.</li> <li>Gothitelle appreciates teammates with Toxic, such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Dark, or Toxic Spikes from Eternatus to help speed up trapping and also allow Gothitelle to trap certain Pokemon it otherwise can't, such as foes behind a Substitute.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Thanks to its great physical bulk, utility, and excellent typing, Alomomola fills valuable niches on bulkier balance teams. Alomomola is useful as a defensive pivot that can shrug off damage thanks to Regenerator, as a status spreader, and as a Wish passer that increases the longevity of its teammates.</li> <li>Toxic allows Alomomola to cripple the longevity of Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and support Arceus formes lacking Refresh. Toxic is especially useful against Primal Groudon and Zygarde, as it keeps Alomomola from being easily set up on while forcing Zygarde to waste Rest PP.</li> <li>Wish allows Alomomola to increase its longevity as well as the longevity of its teammates by providing recovery for allies such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, and Specially Offensive Yveltal that have no reliable recovery options. A slow Flip Turn allows Alomomola to safely pass a Wish to the aforementioned Pokemon. Increased longevity allows these teammates to check Zacian-C, Primal Groudon, Arceus, and Marshadow with more efficiency during the game.</li> <li>Protect allows Alomomola to more easily receive a Wish from itself, scout Choice item sets from Marshadow, Yveltal, and Eternatus, and maximize Toxic damage on the foe.</li> <li>Heavy-Duty Boots allows Alomomola to freely pivot without worrying about entry hazards.</li> <li>The first EV spread maximizes Alomomola's mixed bulk, allowing it to shrug off hits from support Arceus formes and Eternatus. The second EV spread maximizes Alomomola's physical bulk, allowing it to survive a +3 Wild Charge from Zacian-C and two uses of Glacial Lance from Choice Band Calyrex-I. Having 0 Speed IVs allows Alomomola to perform a slow Flip Turn against Chansey and Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Tera Dark allows Alomomola to absorb powerful Psychic-type attacks such as Light that Burns the Sky from Ultra Necrozma and Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A. Tera Dark also makes Alomomola one of the few walls capable of handling Deoxys-A thanks to Alomomola's low weight lessening the power of Low Kick. After switching in, Alomomola can immediately threaten to OHKO Deoxys-A with Flip Turn after Stealth Rock and a turn of Life Orb damage.</li> <li>Tera Poison prevents Alomomola from becoming poisoned, allowing it to serve as a switch-in to Toxic Ho-Oh and utility Arceus formes. Tera Poison also allows Alomomola to absorb Toxic Spikes from Eternatus to keep teammates such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and support Arceus formes status-free, although switching into Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground becomes harder.</li> <li>Alomomola is able to swap into any unboosted physical attack besides Bolt Strike from Zekrom throughout the game consistently, since it can use Regenerator to heal itself back up. It can swap in on Mega Salamence or Arceus-Ground and pivot with Flip Turn to safely bring in an answer such as Arceus-Fairy or Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Thanks to Alomomola's Wish support, teammates without reliable recovery such as Primal Groudon and Giratina-O can switch into Primal Kyogre and Arceus more aggressively throughout the game without worrying about slowly being chipped down.</li> <li>Wallbreaker Primal Kyogre makes it near impossible for Alomomola to safely pass a Wish, so teammates such as Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon are helpful.</li> <li>Alomomola will often get overwhelmed by physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, and Arceus, so teammates such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark help ease Alomomola's workload.</li> <li>Alomomola provides excellent slow pivoting, so Pokemon that capitalize on a free switch such as Deoxys-A, Choice Band Marshadow, Choice Band Chien-Pao, and Meteor Beam Eternatus make excellent teammates.</li> </ul>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Ferrothorn's stellar typing, high bulk, and rare access to Spikes grant it a unique position in the metagame as the cornerstone of hazard-stacking balance teams over Pokemon such as defensive Necrozma-DM. Ferrothorn serves as a sturdy roadblock to wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, which otherwise easily overwhelms most balance teams. Additionally, Ferrothorn checks Ground-types such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde. However, Ferrothorn struggles against more offensive teams, as Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Mega Salamence are able to take advantage of Ferrothorn's passivity to use it as setup fodder.</li> <li>Power Whip provides Ferrothorn the means to scare out Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Ground. Wallbreaker Primal Kyogre is OHKOed after Stealth Rock, and defensive Arceus-Ground is 2HKOed after a single layer of Spikes. Ferrothorn is able to capitalize on the switches it forces to set a layer of Spikes or use Leech Seed to help keep itself healthy. Leech Seed also ensures that Ferrothorn can still defeat defensive Primal Kyogre even when burnt and provides some valuable healing for Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Knock Off is preferred in the last moveslot, as many of Ferrothorn's common switch-ins, such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal, are heavily dependent on their items to function. Protect is an alternative that enables Ferrothorn to rack up healing from Leftovers and Leech Seed and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Rayquaza, Marshadow, and Lunala, but Protect makes it significantly more passive.</li> <li>A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to enable Ferrothorn to outspeed Melmetal under Trick Room. This gives Ferrothorn the flexibility to set a layer of Spikes or Knock Off Melmetal's Choice Band, preventing it from being able to 2HKO Ferrothorn with Tera Steel Double Iron Bash. Ferrothorn maximizes its special bulk to better check wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, as even Water Spout fails to 2HKO.</li> <li>Ferrothorn rarely Terastallizes, as it is reliant on its natural typing to function, but it does benefit from Terastallization in some scenarios. Tera Water swaps Ferrothorn's quadruple Fire weakness for a resistance. While Ferrothorn is not able to meaningfully damage any of the Fire-types in the tier, Tera does enable it to beat Ho-Oh if it is the last Pokemon alive, as Ho-Oh seldom runs recovery and is worn down by Iron Barbs and Leech Seed damage before it is able to knock out Ferrothorn. Tera Grass is an alternative to help Ferrothorn better check Arceus-Ground and Zygarde by turning its neutrality to Ground into a resistance. Tera Grass Power Whip is capable of OHKOing Calm Mind Arceus-Ground after a single layer of Spikes and Leech Seed damage. While Ferrothorn cannot beat Coil Zygarde directly even with Tera Grass, its newfound Ground resistance provides it with extra turns to use Knock Off or Leech Seed before switching to a teammate that can handle Zygarde. Ferrothorn does still have some issues with Dragon Dance Zygarde, however, as it commonly runs Substitute.</li> <li>Ferrothorn is best used in the early- and mid-game to set Spikes against defensive Pokemon such as utility Arceus formes and Alomomola. If Primal Kyogre is on the opposing team, Ferrothorn should prioritize preserving HP until the set is revealed, as it can easily get chipped to where it is unable to switch into wallbreaker Primal Kyogre's Water Spout. Ferrothorn can be used as a lead against hyper offense teams due to its immunity to Smeargle's Spore and Glimmora's Mortal Spin enabling it to break their Focus Sashes easily. Ferrothorn matches up poorly into most hyper offense teams due to its overall passivity, so sacrificing Ferrothorn to deal with suicide leads enables teammates such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark to preserve HP and better handle common threats such as Zacian-C and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Ferrothorn shines against balance and stall teams, as the passive damage it deals racks up over the course of longer games. Many defensive Pokemon are unable to meaningfully damage Ferrothorn, which makes it difficult to wear down. Stall teams in particular have a tough time preventing Ferrothorn from making progress; the only Knock Off absorber, Arceus-Dark, is unable to meaningfully hurt Ferrothorn, as Foul Play activates Iron Barbs. This allows Ferrothorn to keep both itself and its teammates healthy with Leech Seed while freely laying down Spikes.</li> <li>Ferrothorn pairs best with defensive Pokemon that are vulnerable to wallbreaker Primal Kyogre. As such, Zygarde is an excellent teammate for Ferrothorn due to it countering the tier's prominent Fire-types, Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Zygarde is also the best blanket physical wall in the tier and is able to help check physical attackers such as Marshadow and Mega Salamence that are able to break Ferrothorn. Defensive Primal Groudon is also an excellent teammate for Ferrothorn, as it can set Stealth Rock and work in conjunction with Ferrothorn to ensure that Primal Kyogre rarely poses a threat. Ferrothorn can check wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, which often overwhelms Primal Groudon and leaves it unable to check Pokemon such as Zacian-C, while Primal Groudon can remove Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Eternatus that that threaten Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Ferrothorn struggles against Taunt users such as Yveltal and utility Arceus formes. Consequently, Arceus-Fairy is a solid teammate for Ferrothorn, as it counters specially offensive Yveltal and can use Taunt to prevent Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Giratina-O from removing Ferrothorn's Spikes.</li> <li>Choice Band Marshadow is a decent offensive partner for Ferrothorn due to its ability to revenge kill many Pokemon found on hyper offense teams, including Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, and Zacian-C. Ditto can also fill this role, as it threatens to reverse sweep by copying Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Mega Salamence.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Being the sole Electric-type of the tier, Zekrom can remove defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Yveltal. Zekrom's ability, Teravolt, also allows it to break through Dondozo, making it a strong wallbreaker for hyper offense structures.</li> <li>Outrage, when paired with Dragonium Z, becomes a powerful nuke option for Zekrom to use against Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Giratina-O, and Eternatus, all of which resist or are immune to Bolt Strike.</li> <li>Substitute eases predictions, as Zekrom commonly forces switches, and it blocks status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Giratina-O and Toxic from support Arceus formes. It also helps Zekrom set up more easily against Pokemon like Ho-Oh, which attempts to burn Zekrom with Sacred Fire. Roost can be used to give Zekrom more longevity throughout a match and as it sets up.</li> <li>The given EVs allow Zekrom to always outspeed Deoxys-A after a boost while ensuring it survives uninvested Judgment from Arceus-Fairy and two Earth Powers from utility Arceus formes. Alternatively, the second EV spread allows Zekrom to OHKO Ho-Oh, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Primal Kyogre without any boosts, 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM and Extreme Killer Arceus, and OHKO Zacian-C and Dondozo at +1. The Adamant nature also gives Zekrom better chances to OHKO Primal Groudon with +1 Devastating Drake after Stealth Rock while always outspeeding Necrozma-DM, but it cannot outspeed Zacian-C after a boost.</li> <li>Zekrom's unique typing allows it to take hits from Mega Salamence, Primal Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM's STAB moves; however, its exploitable weaknesses and lack of ability to serve as a wall make this trait only useful in a pinch, as Zekrom shouldn't be taking many hits if it wants to sweep effectively. In the scenario where Zekrom struggles to set up, unboosted Devastating Drake is a solid option for weakening foes such as Primal Kyogre, Primal Groudon and Giratina-O to let Zekrom's teammates handle them more easily.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre makes a great partner to Zekrom with its ability to check Primal Groudon, wearing it down for Zekrom to clean up with its Z-Move afterwards. Offensive Necrozma-DM breaks through Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy and Zacian-C for Zekrom to more comfortably use Devastating Drake while also allowing Zekrom to use Outrage once said Fairy-types aren't a factor.</li> <li>Strong physical attackers like Marshadow and Arceus appreciate Zekrom's ability to break through Dondozo, Giratina, and Primal Groudon. Strong special attackers like Calm Mind Arceus formes, Primal Kyogre, and Eternatus also appreciate Zekrom breaking through special walls like Ho-Oh and Chansey, while they can help wear down physical walls like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground so Zekrom can break through them more easily with Dragonium Z.</li> <li>Suicide leads like Shuckle and Smeargle can set up Sticky Web for Zekrom, assisting the secondary EV spread with its drop in Speed while also setting additional entry hazards to meet important damage thresholds; in return, Zekrom offensively pressures Ho-Oh and Yveltal and dissuades them from using Defog to remove Sticky Web.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Landorus-T is a useful pivot for offense and balance teams that is able to check threats such as Primal Groudon and physical Arceus-Ground with Intimidate. Its good Attack stat keeps it from being passive and threatens Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Primal Groudon, and Zekrom, which allows it to have a niche over Alomomola as a physical pivot. Its limited longevity means its window to serve as a pivot is smaller though. It is also unable to recover from specially offensive hits such as Overheat Primal Groudon and Judgement from Arceus formes like Alomomola can due to its lack of recovery.</li> <li>Earthquake takes advantage of Landorus-T's high Attack stat and deals super effective damage to threats like Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Eternatus while hitting a large portion of the tier neutrally.</li> <li>Landorus-T can provide useful utility with Stealth Rock, which aids Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Marshadow in wallbreaking. Toxic can be used to wear down Pokemon Landorus-T cannot otherwise threaten such as Zygarde and support Arceus formes. It can also be used to punish Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Taunt prevents Necrozma-DM from setting up against Landorus-T, Ferrothorn from freely setting Spikes, and Primal Groudon from using Toxic. In addition, it stops Ho-Oh from using Defog.</li> <li>Rocky Helmet allows Landorus-T to punish contact moves from threats it checks such as Zacian-C and Extreme Killer Arceus. Leftovers can be used instead to increase Landorus-T’s longevity to a degree, notably preventing a 2HKO from Giratina-O's Poltergeist even without Intimidate.</li> <li>Landorus-T does not usually need to Terastallize, as its base typing is excellent for the job it needs to do. In addition, teammates such as Chien-Pao, Marshadow, and Rayquaza need it to wallbreak. However, Tera Water can be used in order to take on Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I more easily while tanking Heat Crash from Double Dance Primal Groudon and Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C in a pinch.</li> <li>Tera Dark can be used to allow Landorus-T to serve as a switch-in to the large amount of Psychic-types in the tier such as Ultra Necrozma and Deoxys-A, though Deoxys-A can still 2HKO with Low Kick. In addition, it provides a niche but useful immunity to Taunt from Prankster Grimmsnarl, allowing Landorus-T to serve as a slow pivot against it.</li> <li>Landorus-T is usually best used early-game, where it can set Stealth Rock, allowing allies such as Chien-Pao, Rayquaza, Primal Kyogre, and Marshadow to wallbreak more efficiently. Thanks to Intimidate, Landorus-T can force early-game switches from defensive Primal Groudon, though it relies on its great typing to serve as a pivot due to its relative frailty. Landorus-T's main job early-game is to safely pivot in strong wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao and Marshadow on offensive teams so they can heavily dent the opposing team quickly.</li> <li>Landorus-T can also be used as a one-time check to dangerous threats such as Zacian-C and Primal Groudon. Its limited longevity means it cannot check these threats long-term. Sometimes, the best move can be to sacrifice Landorus-T to their attacks, as its Intimidate alone can force out these threats the next turn in addition to providing Rocky Helmet chip damage or provide a teammate with an excellent setup opportunity.</li> <li>Landorus-T is not extremely weak to entry hazards. However, Stealth Rock can be a nuisance to it, as it cuts down on its already limited longevity. Therefore, Defoggers such as Giratina-O and Ho-Oh make excellent teammates. This increases Landorus-T's longevity as well as the longevity of Pokemon it pivots in like Chien-Pao. These two can also aid in checking Primal Groudon and Zacian-C, which Landorus-T cannot do long-term.</li> <li>Landorus-T is extremely vulnerable to special attackers such as Yveltal and Palkia-O, so checks to these threats such as Calm Mind Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Fairy are appreciated.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Kyurem-B serves as a fearsome physical sweeper, using its monstrous Attack stat to tear apart weakened teams. Kyurem-B is typically used as a late-game wincon on offense teams after its would-be checks such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh lose the ability to check it. Kyurem-B can also be used mid-game to break through balance teams due to the difficulty other teams have switching in. Kyurem-B often forces the other team to use their Terastallization to check it. Kyurem-B typically fits best on offense teams, especially hyper offense teams. However, Kyurem-B's downsides can make it difficult to justify on a team, as it often relies on Terastallization to perform its sweep, it competes with other setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM and Mega Salamence, and it's weak to Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Icicle Spear is Kyurem-B's best Ice-type STAB move, serving as consistent high damage output using Loaded Dice. Icicle Spear is a spammable STAB move due to the tier's abundance of Dragon- and Ground-type Pokemon. At +1 with a Jolly nature, Icicle Spear gets guaranteed 2HKOs on Ho-Oh and offensive Primal Groudon with a chance to 2HKO utility Arceus formes. With an Adamant nature, Icicle Spear can guarantee the 2HKO on utility Arceus formes and become very likely to 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Fusion Bolt lets Kyurem-B hit all of the targets that resist Icicle Spear for at least neutral damage. Fusion Bolt 2HKOes defensive Primal Kyogre without needing to use Dragon Dance first. In addition, at +1, Kyurem-B has a chance to OHKO defensive Primal Kyogre and defensive Ho-Oh, and it can beat Dondozo or force it to Terastallize. Fusion Bolt is also Kyurem-B's best coverage move against Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Substitute lets Kyurem-B dodge status conditions, particularly Toxic from Pokemon such as Alomomola and Primal Groudon, which may threaten to stop its sweep, while also making switching to handle Kyurem-B risky. Kyurem-B's Substitute can survive weaker hits as well such as Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak. In addition, Substitute lets Kyurem-B bypass Trick and Charm from Gothitelle and Imposter from Ditto.</li> <li>Scale Shot can be used as a secondary STAB option, since it is a useful midground option, as defensive cores that combine to resist Icicle Spear and Fusion Bolt will often be hit neutrally by Scale Shot such as a core of Zygarde and Primal Kyogre, allowing you to get around needing to predict defensively. The Speed boost given by Scale Shot may also come in handy, as it allows Kyurem-B to boost past a faster Pokemon while still getting damage such as an opposing Deoxys-A in the back that would threaten to revenge kill it at +1.</li> <li>Tera Electric bolsters the power of Fusion Bolt while also turning incoming Steel-type attacks from a weakness into a resistance. This is incredibly useful in the Necrozma-DM matchup, as Fusion Bolt can 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM, while Sunsteel Strike from defensive Necrozma-DM can 4HKO Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock, which notably doesn't break Kyurem-B's Substitute. In addition, Tera Electric gives Kyurem-B a favorable roll to OHKO Zacian-C if one layer of Spikes is up.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is a defensive Terastallization option, most notably flipping Dragon-type moves such as Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon from a weakness into an immunity while also turning Fighting-type moves from a weakness into a resistance such as Marshadow's Low Kick.</li> <li>Tera Ground + Tera Blast in the third moveslot hits the Steel-types that Kyurem-B normally struggles to break through, most notably Necrozma-DM, while also letting it threaten Terastallized Giratina-O, as Teravolt lets it ignore Levitate.</li> <li>An EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe with an Adamant nature lets Kyurem-B outspeed Adamant nature Zekrom and other neutral Speed nature Pokemon with a base 90 Speed. In addition, the bulk investment allows Kyurem-B to avoid an OHKO from Stone Edge from physical setup sweeper Arceus-Ground at +1.</li> <li>The 252 Atk / 92 Def / 164 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature allows Kyurem-B to outspeed Deoxys-A after a Dragon Dance while avoiding an OHKO from +2 Tera Normal Arceus's Extreme Speed and Ultra Necrozma's Stone Edge.</li> <li>Kyurem-B is best used as a mid- or late-game sweeper. While Kyurem-B has usable bulk, enough to take a hit, its Stealth Rock weakness limits its ability to come onto the field, so it is fairly committal to send in. As such, reserve Kyurem-B for when you feel comfortable bringing it in such as in the face of a Pokemon it can hit super effectively.</li> <li>Kyurem-B is also a fearsome wallbreaker, which gives it an important niche versus balance and stall teams. Kyurem-B can punish passive play by using Substitute against defensive Pokemon, which allows it to set up much more safely. Kyurem-B also has good matchups against keystone defensive Pokemon such as defensive Eternatus and Dondozo. Kyurem-B has to be careful about foes using defensive Terastallization to play around it and threaten it back.</li> <li>Kyurem-B wants to use Terastallization often, so you should support Kyurem-B with Pokemon that don't rely on Terastallization such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Kyurem-B also can force the other team to expend their Terastallization to beat it, removing some prediction for its teammates. Ho-Oh makes a great partner on bulkier offense teams, as it doesn't need to Terastallize that often, and it provides Defog support to remove Stealth Rock for Kyurem-B to come in more easily.</li> <li>Sticky Web support from Smeargle or Shuckle is also great for Kyurem-B, as that allows it to leverage its passable but flawed Speed tier much better.</li> <li>Kyurem-B struggles to break through Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C, so one should pair Kyurem-B with attackers that can deal with them such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

Yveltal's immunity to Psychic allows it to check threats such as Deoxys-A, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Foul Play often forces switches due to its power and deals large amounts of damage to threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma. This also prevents them, as well as Zacian-C, from setting up without massive punishment.</li> <li>Toxic allows Yveltal to chip down Pokemon that resist or have the bulk to tank Foul Play, such as Zygarde, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Water, and Ho-Oh. U-turn can be used instead, allowing Yveltal to grab momentum against predicted switch-ins such as Arceus-Dark and Ho-Oh while bringing in wallbreakers such as Zacian-C and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Taunt prevents Primal Kyogre, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde from setting up on Yveltal. Additionally, it prevents Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Water, and Ho-Oh from crippling Yveltal with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp while also preventing them from using Refresh and Recover, reducing their longevity.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Yveltal to outspeed the different support Arceus formes, meaning it can use Taunt to block their Taunt or utility moves. With this, Yveltal also outspeeds Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, allowing it to cripple them with Toxic or prevent setup with Taunt.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Yveltal to block Extreme Speed from Arceus and Low Kick from Marshadow at the cost of losing the ability to absorb Psychic-type attacks from Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Tera Poison allows Yveltal to better check Zacian-C and wall Arceus-Fairy with the help of Taunt, though checking Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma becomes significantly harder.</li> <li>Defensive Yveltal is a great fit on teams looking for Pokemon that can check a large variety of physical threats and threaten them out consistently, such as balance and stall teams.</li> <li>Throughout the game, Yveltal should try to look for opportunities to spread Toxic to the opposing team or provide momentum through U-turn. Yveltal can create these opportunities by threatening out various physical attackers such as Arceus, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Salamence with Foul Play, forcing opponents to make unfavorable moves.</li> <li>Yveltal should be able to safely stay in on most support Arceus formes thanks to Taunt, as well as against Giratina-O and Zygarde.</li> <li>Yveltal can often get overwhelmed by threats such as Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy, so a teammate such as Ho-Oh or Necrozma-DM that can wall these Pokemon greatly helps it.</li> <li>Fast sweepers such as Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Mega Salamence that take advantage of the chip damage Yveltal provides also make great teammates.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dark Pulse is Yveltal's main attacking option. With Dark Aura and a Life Orb, it allows Yveltal to 2HKO many of the tier's defensive options, such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing has solid neutral coverage with Dark Pulse, being able to hit the Fairy-, Fighting-, and Dark-types that would switch into Dark Pulse, such as Arceus-Dark and opposing Yveltal.</li> <li>Taunt shuts down opposing setup, such as Arceus's Swords Dance, entry hazards, such as Primal Groudon's Stealth Rock, and status moves, such as Ho-Oh's Toxic; when combined with Oblivion Wing, it allows Yveltal to win duels against many Pokemon that would otherwise be able to take on Yveltal's attacks, such as support Arceus formes and defensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Knock Off cripples Pokemon, such as Ho-Oh and Chansey, by removing their item, while Sucker Punch allows Yveltal to punish faster Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo Y, making it a solid revenge killer.</li> <li>Tera Dark boosts Dark Pulse's power to ridiculous feats, such as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Eternatus, defensive Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh, as well as boosting Sucker Punch and Knock Off's damage. Tera Flying can also be used to increase Oblivion Wing's power, letting it hit Arceus-Dark and opposing Yveltal harder, which in return gives Yveltal more longevity.</li> <li>Yveltal should be used as an offensive check to Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Necrozma-DM. Switching into resisted moves such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief and Lunala's Moongeist Beam or attacks Yveltal is immune to such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser allows Yveltal to stay healthy throughout a game, which is important, as Yveltal can get worn down from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil. Oblivion Wing is best suited for use when Yveltal is at low HP, as it should mostly be using Dark Pulse for damage otherwise.</li> <li>Although much of the tier is 2HKOed by Yveltal, most of the metagame is able to 2HKO Yveltal as well, even with neutral moves, such as Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Eternatus's Dynamax Cannon.</li> <li>Yveltal should avoid status as much as possible; Toxic from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O ruins its longevity in longer games, paralysis from Zygarde's Glare and Necrozma-DM's Thunder Wave limits its Speed so it's more likely to be KOed by faster threats, and burns from Ho-Oh and Arceus-Dark weaken the strength of Knock Off and Sucker Punch, the latter being problematic against more offensive teams where priority may be necessary for revenge killing.</li> <li>Yveltal's immediate power allows it to be an early-game wallbreaker for its team, which is good for offensive structures.</li> <li>Specially offensive Yveltal fits best on offensive teams. Primal Groudon is a good partner, as it is able to beat Pokemon like Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy that would be hard for Yveltal to break, while Yveltal can break through Giratina-O and Zygarde for Primal Groudon in return; Yveltal is also able to come in on the Ground-type moves that would threaten Primal Groudon, barring Thousand Arrows from Zygarde, while Primal Groudon comes in on the Fairy- and Electric-type moves that threaten Yveltal, such as Zacian-C's Play Rough and Primal Kyogre's Thunder. Ho-Oh can remove Stealth Rock for Yveltal, which improves its longevity. Necrozma-DM is able to handle Fairy- and Ice-types such as Calyrex-I and Arceus-Fairy, and Yveltal can come into the Ghost-, Dark-, and Ground-type moves that Necrozma-DM struggles with, such as Marshadow's Spectral Thief, opposing Yveltal's Dark Pulse, and Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Powerful physical sweepers such as Zacian-C, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Yveltal removing common physical walls such as Zygarde, Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Dondozo, while they handle the special walls such as Ho-Oh and Chansey in return; Zacian-C in particular can break through opposing Yveltal and Arceus-Dark with Play Rough, letting Yveltal spam Dark Pulse more easily.</li> <li>Hazard hyper offense teams using suicide leads such as Deoxys-S, Smeargle, Shuckle, and Glimmora appreciate Yveltal stopping Defog attempts from Ho-Oh, Giratina, and support Arceus formes with Taunt, as well as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Ho-Oh, defensive Eternatus, and Giratina with Knock Off.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Foul Play makes Yveltal an excellent revenge killer against many offensive teams, being able to use the Attack boosts of Pokemon such as Swords Dance Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM against them to break right through them before they have the chance to cause major damage. Dark Pulse is a strong Dark-type STAB move if a more consistent damage output is required to clean late-game.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing allows Yveltal to reliably revenge kill Marshadow and maintain its health somewhat. Roost may be considered to keep itself healthy as well, but locking into it can be risky against many teams.</li> <li>Defog allows Yveltal to be one of the best solutions to hyper offense teams in the tier, clearing entry hazards early-game due to how many switches it forces with Foul Play. Yveltal notably does not have its Speed dropped by Sticky Web. If its team already has a consistent Defogger, Toxic may be chosen to punish support Arceus formes more consistently.</li> <li>U-turn allows Yveltal to better take advantage of Pokemon that switch in like defensive Eternatus, Arceus-Dark, and Arceus-Fairy to maintain momentum for its team.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Yveltal to outspeed fully invested base 95s such as Rayquaza and Kyurem-B and survive a +1 Outrage from Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma, and revenge kill it with either Foul Play or Dark Pulse. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to strengthen Oblivion Wing.</li> <li>Tera Dark allows Yveltal to OHKO +3 Zacian-C with Foul Play and removes its Stealth Rock weakness; however, Tera Steel is also a good option to allow Yveltal to become much more resilient against the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus while also turning its Stealth Rock and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances.</li> <li>Because Yveltal is still quite physically bulky and is able to punish foes even if they boost, it is best to use Yveltal proactively rather than reactively to keep setup sweepers in check by bringing it in on predicted setup moves or to take a hit and fire back with Foul Play.</li> <li>Yveltal fits very well on offensive teams where its short-term utility and late-game cleaning prowess are put on full display, being able to almost singlehandedly shut down entire hyper offense teams that such structures otherwise have trouble against and trade blows with surprise sweepers that may otherwise run away with the game.</li> <li>Alternative Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O are great teammates on such teams, matching up very well against the tier's best Stealth Rock setters and keeping hazards off for Yveltal to stay as healthy as possible throughout a game.</li> <li>Offensive Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon variants are also notable partners, being able to take advantage of the many switches Yveltal forces and the common Fairy-types it will find itself luring in for a safe setup opportunity. This allows Yveltal to clean up later. Furthermore, they are capable of setting up Stealth Rock in order to further facilitate Yveltal late-game, as Yveltal greatly appreciates the prior damage on Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Eternatus to more easily clean up games.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Between the highest physical bulk in the metagame after triggering Power Construct and the need for only one attacking move to hit most of the tier for neutral damage, Zygarde is the best wall in the tier. It is capable of handling multiple top threats in the tier such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Thousand Arrows is a potent Ground-type STAB move that hits airborne foes, leaving only Tera Grass users like defensive Ho-Oh as legitimate switch-ins that can still be played around by Zygarde. Glare allows Zygarde to cripple any foe it can stay in against, rendering them easier to outspeed for itself and its allies, which include offensive Arceus formes and Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Coil enables Zygarde to become a wincon and makes it hard to break past on the physical side. It becomes a bulky sweeper if the other team can't force it out, easily setting up on foes such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Rest provides Zygarde with longevity to not worry as much about being worn down and renders status effects such as Toxic poison from Arceus-Dark and Primal Groudon and burn from the likes of Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Arceus-Dark's Will-O-Wisp as ineffective methods to cripple it in the long run.</li> <li>Terastallizing covers Zygarde's 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, rendering it much harder to KO by foes such as Arceus-Water and the uncommon Calyrex-I. Tera Water Zygarde excels at checking the previously mentioned Pokemon while gaining uncommon weaknesses, turning into a good answer to Pokemon like defensive Primal Kyogre, Zacian-C, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Tera Fairy renders it immune to phazing by Dragon Tail from opposing Zygarde while also becoming a sturdy wall against foes such as Marshadow, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark. Tera Poison keeps Zygarde as a good check to foes such as Marshadow, Arceus-Fairy, and Eternatus, raises Zygarde's longevity by becoming immune to Toxic from support Arceus formes, and lets it absorb Eternatus's Toxic Spikes, supporting its team with entry hazard control.</li> <li>Before Terastallizing, it's best for Zygarde's base typing to be considered in relation to the opposing team. For example, as Zygarde is among the most solid Primal Groudon answers, Terastallizing will worsen its matchup against it; therefore, it often Terastallizes mid- or late-game when Primal Groudon is no longer an issue.</li> <li>Marshadow's Spectral Thief can steal Zygarde's setup boosts, so it's best to avoid trying to set up while Marshadow remains a threat on the other team.</li> <li>As Zygarde wants to trigger Power Construct to considerably raise its stats, it's often a good idea to bring Zygarde in early-game to cripple and wear down foes and let Zygarde itself get worn down into range for its ability to trigger.</li> <li>Zygarde's special bulk can be lacking even as Zygarde-C against foes like Primal Kyogre, Eternatus, and Yveltal if it cannot Terastallize, so it appreciates special walls to complement it such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Taunt from foes such as support Arceus formes, Gothitelle, and Yveltal considerably shut Zygarde down; therefore, it likes wallbreakers to handle them that don't mind Taunt like Zacian-C and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>As Zygarde provides speed control by using Glare as much as possible, wallbreakers such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Marshadow benefit from the crippled Speed of foes that would otherwise outspeed them such as Zacian-C, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Eternatus. In return, these teammates threaten Ho-Oh, which can phaze Zygarde with Whirlwind and shrug off the damage with Regenerator. This makes Zygarde a solid option for bulky offense and more defensive team structures ranging from balance to stall.</li> </ul>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde is among the most threatening setup sweepers available, benefitting from its gargantuan bulk and access to the extremely valuable Thousand Arrows to break through the opposing team. Thousand Arrows hits crucial targets like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Eternatus. Grounding airborne targets is fantastic and renders would-be checks like Ho-Oh and Yveltal unable to fulfill their roles properly. Substitute lets Zygarde set up on passive walls like Chansey, Gothitelle, and Giratina reliably. It also eases the activation of Power Construct and blocks status, which is especially useful against Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Primal Groudon's Toxic.</li> <li>Dragon Tail grants a powerful phazing tool to force out what would otherwise be hard checks and counters like Dondozo, defensive Tera Grass Ho-Oh, and Coil Zygarde. Against Ho-Oh in particular, Zygarde outruns it once boosted and can use Dragon Tail before it uses Whirlwind. Glare ruins aggressive switches from Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Dark, and Marshadow that would attempt to offensively check it.</li> <li>Leftovers grants Zygarde appreciated recovery, which is especially useful against passive foes such as defensive Ho-Oh, Chansey, and Blissey that fail to break its Substitute. Zygarde can also opt for Groundium Z to turn Thousand Arrows into Tectonic Rage, which lets it OHKO foes like Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Ultra Necrozma at +1. At +2, it can even OHKO foes like defensive Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ground after some chip damage. Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Dragon Tail allows Zygarde to get a surprise OHKO at +1 on Mega Salamence, as well as opposing defensive Zygarde after some chip damage, which would otherwise try to set up on it. Thanks to Devastating Drake having neutral priority, unlike Dragon Tail, Zygarde can easily eliminate Ditto and phazers like Giratina and opposing Dragon Tail Zygarde.</li> <li>Investing 12 EVs in HP maximizes Leftovers recovery. Alongside 48 EVs in Special Defense, it allows Zygarde to survive one Ice Beam from defensive Arceus formes. The even HP spread also allows Zygarde to activate Power Construct after only two Substitutes if using a Z-Crystal. Investing 232 EVs in Speed lets Zygarde outrun Eternatus at +1 after Power Construct.</li> <li>Tera Ground is the premier Tera type when running Leftovers, further boosting Thousand Arrows and allowing it to almost always OHKO Marshadow at +1 while 2HKOing fast support Arceus-Ground. It also turns Zygarde's 4x weakness to Ice into a 2x weakness, which is especially relevant against defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Zygarde can also opt for a defensive Tera type. With Tera Fairy, it becomes immune to Dragon, blocking any attempt at phazing it from the likes of Giratina and opposing Dragon Tail Zygarde. Tera Water can be used to turn the tables against defensive Primal Kyogre thanks to granting Zygarde a resistance to both Scald and Ice Beam. Removing its weakness to Fairy also allows Zygarde to set up one more time against the likes of Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy and retaliate harder with a boosted Thousand Arrows.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde is a good choice on bulky offense teams looking for a good way to disrupt and clean the opposing team once it has been chipped down.</li> <li>It's preferable to keep this Zygarde set unrevealed before attempting to set up. In particular, this set works best if the opponent is forced to Terastallize a non-Tera Fairy Pokemon, like Tera Grass Ho-Oh, so Zygarde can spam Dragon Tail with ease.</li> <li>Another good strategy is to reveal Substitute early to activate Power Construct and then attempt to sweep later in the game once Zygarde has been made much more bulky thanks to its ability.</li> <li>Due to the fact that this set trades off its defensive aspect for more offensive power, a good defensive core is often required to address setup sweepers before Zygarde can find an opportunity to set up itself. Primal Kyogre, defensive Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Dark all help to deal with common setup sweepers like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Wallbreakers like Choice Band Marshadow, special Ultra Necrozma, and Rayquaza can help chip away at Tera Fairy physical walls like Roar Giratina, defensive Zygarde-C, and Dondozo that this set cannot break nor phaze once they have Terastallized.</li> </ul>"

      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Zygarde-C's gargantuan bulk, effective boosting options, and great attacking moves make it a top-tier physical wall and sweeper.</li> <li>Thousand Waves allows Zygarde to trap its foe, and given its limited list of checks and its ability to flip matchups with Terastallization, it can often use the target as setup fodder and sweep through the opposing team by trapping otherwise decent checks, like non-Taunt Arceus formes and Eternatus. In the event that Zygarde can't set up, it can still pivot to a teammate after trapping its foe.</li> <li>Dragon Dance and Coil boost Zygarde's mediocre Attack to threatening levels. The former's Speed boost lets it avoid having to run Scale Shot, while the latter's Defense boost gives Zygarde an easier time setting up on Attack-boosting foes, such as Zacian-C and Arceus.</li> <li>Thousand Arrows should be used with Dragon Dance, providing Zygarde with the means to hit foes immune to Ground like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Scale Shot should be used with Coil, hitting the aforementioned foes while boosting Zygarde's Speed, with Coil reversing Scale Shot's Defense-lowering effect.</li> <li>80 HP EVs let Zygarde always survive defensive Arceus-Water's Ice Beam, letting it safely activate Power Construct against it, while 204 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature let Zygarde always OHKO defensive Ho-Oh at +6 Attack. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to make Zygarde as physically bulky as possible, helping it take attacks from foes such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon. If Zygarde isn't running Thousand Arrows, a spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 80 SpD / 132 Spe with a Careful nature lets Zygarde avoid a 2HKO from Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike and an OHKO from Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock while letting Zygarde-C always outspeed Choice Scarf Yveltal at +2.</li> <li>Terastallization is extremely potent on Zygarde, letting it set up on foes it otherwise couldn't by replacing its exploitable weaknesses to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy. Tera Water notably gives Zygarde a resistance to Water and Ice, letting it set up on Primal Kyogre and non-Taunt Arceus-Water. Tera Poison turns Zygarde's Fairy weakness into a resistance, letting it set up on Zacian-C.</li> <li>A large part of this Zygarde's effectiveness is a result of its surprise factor, luring in checks such as non-Taunt Arceus formes and turning them into setup fodder. Zygarde is often reliant on Terastallization to accomplish this, so players should carefully consider the need to Terastallize their other Pokemon if they wish to preserve Zygarde's sweeping potential.</li> <li>Players should typically try getting Zygarde to below 50% HP to activate Power Construct. This can be achieved by letting a trapped foe weaken Zygarde, or by letting it get worn down by residual damage and stray hits. However, Zygarde's HP should be carefully managed, given that Rest only has 8 PP and renders Zygarde passive during its sleep turns.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, utility Arceus formes, and Eternatus can weaken the opposing team, letting Zygarde-C OHKO foes such as defensive Arceus formes with Thousand Waves.</li> <li>Wallbreakers such as Primal Kyogre and Necrozma-DM can soften up foes such as opposing Zygarde and Arceus formes, letting it sweep more easily.</li> </ul>"

Earth Power is an alternative to OHKO Glimmora and situationally hit common switch-ins in Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>The given EV spread lets Mega Diancie avoid an OHKO from Choice Band Tera Flying Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and Choice Band Marshadow's Low Kick after Stealth Rock as well as a 2HKO from Life Orb Yveltal's Dark Pulse while ensuring that it outspeeds neutral-natured foes with base 120 Speed, such as Palkia-O and Mega Salamence, on top of OHKOing specially offensive Yveltal with Moonblast.</li> <li>Especially against non-hyper offense teams, if at Team Preview it's clear that Mega Diancie's relative lack of Speed and frail nature for the metagame may render it outsped and OHKOed, it should be kept for the mid-game, where it can come into foes such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O to force a switch while setting at least one entry hazard.</li> <li>Mega Diancie has significantly higher bulk before Mega Evolving, so it may be desirable to Mega Evolve it later on to withstand an attack such as unboosted Mega Salamence's Earthquake or defensive Arceus-Ground's Judgment. In very niche scenarios where Sticky Web manages to get into its side of the field, preserving Diancie's Mega Evolution to keep Clear Body for the mid-game can help preserve Diancie's Speed. Clear Body can also be used to avoid being hindered by Glimmora's Mud Shot, but this also can let Glimmora lay entry hazards instead in the event of an incorrect prediction.</li> <li>Faster foes such as Zacian-C, offensive Arceus-Water, and Deoxys-A can prevent Mega Diancie from doing anything by immediately OHKOing it. Allies such as Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and Necrozma-DM act as good partners to mitigate this issue by providing alternatives to play around them.</li> <li>Mega Diancie can become setup fodder to foes such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Zacian-C.

        "description": "<ul> <li>Despite being relatively slow and having underwhelming stats compared to the rest of the tier, Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge can be incredibly useful to many powerful Psychic-types, increasing their power while protecting them from otherwise-crippling priority such as Sucker Punch from Yveltal, Shadow Sneak from Marshadow and Giratina-O, and Extreme Speed from Arceus.</li> <li>Taunt prevents slower Pokemon such as Ho-Oh from using Defog against Tapu Lele and also stops entry hazards from setters such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Glimmora. This can be particularly handy against Smeargle, as blocking it from setting Sticky Web prevents foes from outspeeding teammates such as Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Moonblast threatens Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark, preventing them from aggressively switching into Tapu Lele or anti-leading against it, and the move also hits Giratina-O for a good amount of damage to dissuade it from switching into Tapu Lele, especially if it has already been dealt chip damage from a teammate.</li> <li>Either Psyshock or Psychic can be used to threaten most switch-ins that don't really mind Moonblast, particularly Eternatus and Primal Groudon; Psychic hits harder and hits Pokemon like Primal Groudon, but Psyshock does more damage to specially defensive Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Chansey, and Calm Mind Arceus formes.</li> <li>Nature's Madness makes it unsafe for virtually any Pokemon, including Chansey and Ho-Oh, to sit on Tapu Lele in an attempt to stall out Psychic Terrain turns, allowing it to unconditionally weaken such foes if they are left in and possibly even put them into OHKO range for its other moves.</li> <li>Terastallizing Tapu Lele should only be done if absolutely necessary, as many Psychic Terrain sweepers strongly value Tera. Tera Normal can allow Tapu Lele to defeat Marshadow one-on-one in a pinch and blank Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball and Lunala's Moongeist Beam, which can be particularly handy when facing opposing Psychic Terrain and Ditto. Tera Steel can work to block Mortal Spin from Glimmora, which can be particularly handy when Tapu Lele is paired with Sticky Web. Tera Fairy lets Tapu Lele's Moonblast OHKO offensive Yveltal while doing a strong amount of damage to defensive ones, and it lets Tapu Lele relatively easily handle Arceus-Dark by itself by giving it a resistance to its STAB move and doing extremely heavy damage to it.</li> <li>While Tapu Lele has usable Special Attack and benefits from Psychic Terrain itself, its power pales in comparison to Pokemon such as Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma, so it should stay in for as few turns as possible to maximize the number of turns teammates have to use Psychic Terrain. However, even though its bulk and typing are sufficient to let it switch into many attacks, Tapu Lele's lack of pivot and self-sacrifice moves along with the general fraility and common shared weaknesses of most potential teammates can turn this into a double-edged sword after it is sent in; it can sometimes get stuck on the field for multiple turns after coming in, consuming precious turns of Psychic Terrain without being able to meaningfully make progress, and it can also become setup fodder for Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma and Arceus-Ground. As such, achieving maximum turns of Psychic Terrain often involves risky play that leads to either sacrificing Tapu Lele or, because there is value to preserve Tapu Lele later to reset Psychic Terrain, a teammate. To minimize this, opportunities to save a suicide lead, if run, after it has set entry hazards by switching Tapu Lele into attacks that it can survive such as Sacred Fire from Ho-Oh, Low Kick from Marshadow, and Judgment from support Arceus formes and immediately switching back into the lead on the next attack can beneficial for this purpose.</li> <li>Preserving Tapu Lele in stall matchups can allow it to stallbreak with Nature's Madness and Taunt.</li> <li>When resetting Psychic Terrain, it can be appropriate to just use Tapu Lele as death fodder against offensive teams, as it only needs to survive entry hazard damage to set Psychic Terrain, allowing teammates to use the maximum amount of Psychic Terrain turns. However, there is some merit in switching it into priority moves, particuarly against common Choice Band users such as Rayquaza and Marshadow. This dynamic can also dissuade priority users from using priority moves even if Psychic Terrain is not active for fear of giving Tapu Lele a safe switch to reset the Terrain for free yet again.</li> <li>It may be useful to keep Tapu Lele in if it can do something meaningful, such as using Taunt to prevent opposing entry hazards, Defog, or setup from slower Speed boosters such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Tapu Lele's influence comes from the Pokemon it enables. Meteor Beam Deoxys-A is the biggest beneficiary of Psychic Terrain, as it deeply appreciates priority protection of all sorts due to its nonexistent bulk while often taking out Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal with its Meteor Beam, at which point it can spam an absurdly powerful Expanding Force that is sufficient to OHKO almost everything it hits neutrally at +1, including defensive Primal Groudon, offensive Arceus formes, offensive Primal Kyogre, and Terastallized Eternatus. Additionally due to the Psychic Terrain, Deoxys-A being less reliant on Tera to avoid priority makes it even easier to fit onto teams. Ultra Necrozma's bulk in base forme, powerful Light That Burns the Sky, and ability to set up with Dragon Dance complement the general fast, frail special attackers otherwise used as teammates, warding against counterplay in specially defensive Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre while not being overly reliant on Psychic Terrain to sweep like Expanding Force users. Ultra Necrozma also particularly enjoys protection against Marshadow's Shadow Sneak and Yveltal's Sucker Punch and the potential of teammates and Tapu Lele itself to threaten Yveltal and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Glimmora can also be a good teammate, as it is very consistent at setting various entry hazards to put bulkier Pokemon such as Arceus formes into OHKO range for teammates while preventing opposing hazards and threatening Ho-Oh and Yveltal with its Power Gem. Alternatively, while they are less consistent at getting Stealth Rock up, Sticky Web from setters such as Smeargle and Shuckle may provide some added insurance against opposing opposing speedy or otherwise dangerous threats such as Deoxys-A, Ultra Necrozma, Zacian-C, and Booster Energy Flutter Mane. Sticky Web can be particularly helpful in allowing for the freer use of potential teammates such as Lunala, Basculegion, and Mega Mewtwo Y while also potentially freeing up team members such as Deoxys-A to not run Speed-boosting natures for more power. Ditto may be appropriate to handle Speed boosters such as Arceus-Ground as well as Sticky Web sweepers.</li> </ul>"

  "Lunala": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Specs Lunala is an excellent wallbreaker on bulky offensive or balance teams. Its combination of Moongeist Beam and Moonblast allows it to OHKO or 2HKO a majority of the tier, with only a few exceptions such as Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Kyogre. Blissey and Chansey also cannot get 2HKOed, but they are more niche. It can muscle through defensive Pokemon, sponging neutral hits with ease because it possesses high natural bulk for an offensive Pokemon. With Tera Ghost, no viable Pokemon in the tier can safely switch into it.</li> <li>Moonblast is invaluable to Lunala, as it makes Dark-types a shaky switch-in. It 2HKOes defensive Yveltal and Arceus-Dark, and it has a high roll to OHKO specially offensive Yveltal. Moonblast can also be used as a midground option if the opposing team has a Dark-type in order to ease prediction.</li> <li>Unlike Psychic, Psyshock allows Lunala to chunk Pokemon with high Special Defense, such as defensive Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Psyshock also OHKOes defensive Eternatus after Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes. Another big advantage to Psyshock is that it allows Lunala to save PP on its Moongeist Beam while still dealing meaningful damage.</li> <li>Trick allows Lunala to punish defensive Pokemon like Ho-Oh and defensive Yveltal that otherwise freely switch into it. This does come with the caveat of making it unable to 2HKO Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy, defensive Primal Groudon, defensive Necrozma-DM after Tera, and Zygarde after Tera once it loses its Choice Specs. It also misses out on OHKOing offensive Necrozma-DM, offensive Eternatus, and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Tera Ghost enhances Lunala's wallbreaking potential. After Tera, it is now able to consistently 2HKO Ho-Oh and specially offensive Yveltal. It also gains the ability to OHKO offensive Primal Groudon while also 3HKOing Arceus-Dark, making it unable to switch in. Tera Ghost also provides defensive merit to Lunala, as without the extra weakness to Ghost and Dark, it can now tank a Hex from special utility Giratina-O, a Foul Play from defensive Arceus-Dark, and a Poltergeist from Life Orb Marshadow without Shadow Shield. At full HP, Lunala is able to tank a Poltergeist from Tera Ghost Life Orb Marshadow, a Poltergeist from Choice Band Marshadow, a Dark Pulse or Knock Off from Tera Dark specially offensive Yveltal, and a Poltergeist from Giratina-O.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is also an option to consider over Tera Ghost. Terastallizing into a Fairy-type gives it an outstanding defensive typing, This also provides Lunala the capacity to take hits from Arceus-Dark, Giratina-O, Marshadow, and Yveltal, as well as allowing it to OHKO defensive Yveltal and Arceus-Dark with Moonblast. Tera Fairy should be considered on bulky offense teams that may lack the backbone to handle Lunala's threats.</li> <li>Lunala thrives against bulkier team structures. It is able to punish defensive Pokemon fairly reliably given the right prediction. Unfortunately, hyper offense teams have Pokemon that tend to overwhelm Lunala. Being Choice-locked allows Pokemon like Zacian-C, Arceus, and Ultra Necrozma a free setup opportunity, conceding momentum. If Shadow Shield remains intact, Lunala can often trade with some Pokemon such as offensive Primal Groudon, Ultra Necrozma, and Zacian-C. Otherwise, Lunala is reliant upon its teammates during these matchups.</li> <li>Lunala struggles against the tier's Ghost- and Dark-types, so having defensive Pokemon that are able to handle them means that Lunala's potential as a wallbreaker can be fully materialized. On a balance or bulky offense team structure, Coil Zygarde, defensive Arceus-Fairy, and defensive Arceus-Dark are three such examples that help assist in dealing with Pokemon that would otherwise capitalize on Lunala, such as Marshadow, Yveltal, physical utility Giratina-O, Arceus-Dark, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Pokemon that synergize well with Lunala offensively can punish foes that otherwise brush off Lunala's hits. Zacian-C used in conjunction with Lunala can create an excellent offensive core on bulkier teams. Lunala deals with Primal Groudon, Dondozo, Necrozma-DM, and Alomomola, which otherwise check Zacian-C. Zacian-C supports it in return by dealing with Marshadow and Yveltal. Choice Band Rayquaza can also be considered as an offensive partner due to its ability to 2HKO Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul>"
      },
      "Meteor Beam": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Meteor Beam Lunala is an essential wallbreaker on Psyspam teams that works in conjunction with other Pokemon such as Meteor Beam Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma to overwhelm shared counterplay such as Arceus-Dark and Yveltal. Despite appearing to be a good option as a standalone wallbreaker for balance and bulky offense, it should only be used on Psyspam teams; without the full support of a Psyspam team, Meteor Beam Lunala is outclassed by other wallbreakers such as Eternatus and specially offensive Yveltal, which are more consistent and require little support to be effective wallbreakers. These Pokemon, Eternatus in particular, are substantially more difficult to revenge kill due to their defensive typing and higher Speed.</li> <li>Meteor Beam is used to OHKO Pokemon that would otherwise wall Lunala such as Yveltal and Ho-Oh. The Special Attack boost provided by Meteor Beam makes it difficult to check Lunala defensively; for example, defensive Primal Groudon and utility Arceus formes are 2HKOed by +1 Moongeist Beam, while defensive Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh are 2HKOed by +1 Psyshock in Psychic Terrain.</li> <li>Moongeist Beam and Psyshock provide strong neutral coverage. Moonblast rounds out Lunala's moveset and makes Dark-types such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Chien-Pao hesitate to swith in. Psyshock is run over Psychic to enable Lunala to deal with special walls such as Ho-Oh and more niche Pokemon such as Chansey that shrug off Moongeist Beam.</li> <li>Lunala frequently utilizes Tera Fairy for defensive purposes and to wallbreak for its teammates. Tera Fairy enables it to effortlessly remove one of the biggest threats to Psyspam teams, Choice Scarf Yveltal. Since Yveltal poses no threat to it after Tera, Lunala can opt to OHKO with either Meteor Beam and get a boost or with Tera Fairy Moonblast after Stealth Rock. Additionally, +1 Tera Fairy Moonblast OHKOes utility Arceus-Dark after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Lunala is best used as a mid-game wallbreaker. It often uses Tera Fairy to remove Pokemon that can be a headache to Psyspam teams, such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Marshadow. Using Tera to remove these threats is a worthwhile expenditure, as this often enables teammates such as Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma to sweep.</li> <li>Tapu Lele is a mandatory teammate to set Psychic Terrain. Tapu Lele's Moonblast also relieves Lunala of some of the burden of handling Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark. Glimmora is commonly used as a dedicated lead, as it can consistently set and remove entry hazards to keep Shadow Shield intact. Additionally, Smeargle and Shuckle can be used instead of or alongside Glimmora to provide Sticky Web support to enable Lunala to outspeed Pokemon such as Marshadow, Eternatus, and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma round out an offensive core that is difficult for many teams to withstand. Deoxys-A provides speed control to help with Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Zacian-C, and it also provides a second Meteor Beam that can be useful in case Lunala misses or when the opposing team has multiple targets such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Ultra Necrozma adds a physical attacker and a potent win condition after a Dragon Dance. Furthermore, it has some resilience to Ditto, as it needs to be heavily chipped to be revenge killed. Additionally, Ditto makes an excellent teammate itself, as it can revenge kill boosted threats such as Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Rock Polish Primal Groudon, which can easily slice through Psyspam teams if given an opportunity to boost.</li> </ul>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Pheromosa is a solid offensive pivot with good role compression thanks to its blazing Speed tier, massive Attack stat, and useful utility in Rapid Spin. Pheromosa is a good fit on balance teams that need a fast wallbreaker or pivot that can check Deoxys-A. However, due to its frailty, weakness to priority, and middling typing, Pheromosa does require a lot of support to fill its role effectively.</li> <li>Triple Axel provides essential coverage against Yveltal, Eternatus, and Giratina-O while also denying entry hazards against Smeargle and Deoxys-A leads by breaking their Focus Sash and removing them from play.</li> <li>Rapid Spin allows Pheromosa to take advantage of the many switches it forces by clearing hazards for teammates such as specially offensive Yveltal and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Choice Band makes it difficult for opposing Pokemon to switch in against Pheromosa, as Necrozma-DM and Alomomola on a roll are 2HKOed by Close Combat, Giratina-O and Eternatus are 2HKOed by Triple Axel while defensive Yveltal risks the OHKO from it, and wallbreaker Primal Kyogre is OHKOed by Close Combat after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Tera Fighting skyrockets Pheromosa’s wallbreaking power, as now even Dondozo, defensive Primal Groudon, and offensive Eternatus are 2HKOed by Close Combat. Tera Fighting also guarantees an OHKO on Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Tera Ghost prevents Extreme Speed from Arceus and Rayquaza, allowing Pheromosa to revenge kill them more consistently. Tera Normal blocks Shadow Sneak from Marshadow and Giratina-O, so it can revenge kill Marshadow and KO a weakened Giratina-O more efficiently.</li> <li>Pheromosa is useful at breaking holes in the opposing team and chipping walls such as Giratina-O and Necrozma-DM early-game. It is best to mostly use U-turn early-game to scout Terastallizations it can force from foes such as Arceus-Dark and Zygarde. Pheromosa is also an excellent late-game cleaner once Ho-Oh and parts of defensive cores such as Giratina-O and Primal Groudon are removed.</li> <li>Teams with defensive cores including Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Primal Groudon, Eternatus, and Necrozma-DM can collectively wall Pheromosa and punish wrong predictions. It is best to continually use U-turn to chip down these cores without the possibility of losing momentum, although Rocky Helmet Necrozma-DM can heavily punish this. In that case, it is best to have a teammate such as specially offensive Yveltal with Knock Off pressure Necrozma-DM instead. Pheromosa also needs to be wary of Choice Scarf Yveltal, as this set can unexpectedly snipe it off with Oblivion Wing.</li> <li>Pheromosa needs solid defensive teammates to tank attacks from opposing threats like Necrozma-DM and Yveltal after it pivots out such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Fairy, and Ho-Oh. Pheromosa also appreciates teammates that can hard switch into Extreme Speed from Arceus and Shadow Sneak from Marshadow, such as Giratina-O and Yveltal.</li> <li>Gothitelle is an excellent teammate, as it can trap Ho-Oh, which Pheromosa struggles to make progress against. In addition, Gothitelle can trap parts of defensive cores such as defensive Primal Groudon and Eternatus, allowing Pheromosa to more easily pressure the rest of the team.</li> <li>Pheromosa can often use U-turn to scout switch-ins and put a teammate in an excellent position. Setup sweepers that take advantage of its positioning such as Double Dance Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Mega Salamence make excellent teammates. These Pokemon can easily gain a free turn of setup by threatening out typical Pheromosa switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Necrozma-DM's incredible stats in both formes, excellent offensive movepool, and powerful boosting option in Dragon Dance make it one of NatDex Ubers's premier sweepers.</li> <li>Earthquake targets Steel-types such as opposing Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C and also hits Primal Groudon for super effective damage.</li> <li>Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh, which can tank any of +1 Necrozma-DM's other moves except Light That Burns the Sky and either phaze it or use Sacred Fire to hit it pre-Ultra Burst for super effective damage and threaten both formes with a burn. Sunsteel Strike targets Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy, and it's especially powerful when it has STAB pre-Ultra Burst. Outrage is an alternative, offering Ultra Necrozma a powerful STAB attack that can hit Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark for huge damage, but leaving Necrozma locked into the move makes it a niche option.</li> <li>Light That Burns the Sky provides +1 Ultra Necrozma with the means to OHKO foes such as offensive Arceus formes and defensive Ho-Oh, though Necrozma-DM cannot use it before or on the turn it Ultra Bursts.</li> <li>140 Speed EVs allow Ultra Necrozma to outspeed Chi-Yu unboosted and Choice Scarf Yveltal at +1. 24 HP and 92 Defense EVs allow Ultra Necrozma to avoid an OHKO from +2 Arceus's Extreme Speed after Spikes and Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak after switching into Stealth Rock as Necrozma-DM. 4 Special Defense EVs avoid a OHKO from +1 Eternatus's Fire Blast after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>224 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Ultra Necrozma to outspeed Marshadow and Arceus formes unboosted, but the loss in bulk makes Ultra Necrozma likely to fall after Stealth Rock to a +2 Arceus's Extreme Speed and Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>An alternate spread of 16 HP / 192 Atk / 168 Def / 132 Spe with an Adamant nature allows as Ultra Necrozma to outspeed Yveltal, avoid a OHKO from specially offensive Yveltal's Sucker Punch, and OHKOes defensive Zygarde with +1 Light that Burns the Sky after a layer of Spikes and Leftovers recovery.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM best fits on offense teams looking for an exceptionally powerful sweeper that can set up on common offensive threats like Zacian-C.</li> <li>Choosing when to Ultra Burst is essential to letting Necrozma-DM sweep. Doing so provides Ultra Necrozma with the ability to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and many boosted threats when at +1, such as the likes of Zacian-C and +2 Rock Polish Primal-Groudon, foes a +1 Necrozma-DM fails to outspeed. However, Necrozma-DM's defensive profile becomes considerably worse when it Ultra Bursts, losing bulk, Prism Armor, and many of its resistances, notably exchanging its resistances to Fairy and Ice for weaknesses. However, the loss of its weaknesses to Fire and Ground, notably gaining a resistance to the former, does help Necrozma-DM better take on foes such as Primal Groudon. Gaining a resistance to Water also allows Ultra Necrozma to have an easier time handling Primal Kyogre. Additionally, the increase in Necrozma-DM's power, notably against foes weak to its moves thanks to Neuroforce, and access to Light That Burns the Sky make Ultra Necrozma a more potent wallbreaker.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM enjoys support from entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S, which can wear down foes such as Arceus-Dark and Primal Groudon. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl are notably helpful for allowing Necrozma-DM to set up very easily on common attackers like Zacian-C and Eternatus.</li> <li>Fellow wallbreaking and sweeping teammates such as Zacian-C and Arceus can help break holes in the opposing team for Necrozma-DM by eliminating or weakening foes such as Arceus-Dark and Ho-Oh, or they can sweep using the holes it creates breaking through bulky foes such as Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes.</li> </ul>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a ferocious wallbreaker and cleaner that finds a home on bulky offense and balance teams. Necrozma-DM is able to leverage its bulk, typing, ability, and the possbility of bluffing the threat of Ultra Necrozma to force a switch or absorb an incoming attack such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades or Arceus-Dark's Foul Play and then use Dragon Dance.</li> <li>If Ho-Oh is sufficiently covered, Stone Edge can be substituted for Photon Geyser. This move still hits Ho-Oh hard while enabling Necrozma-DM to beat Dondozo, which would otherwise wall it. It has the added benefit of OHKOing Eternatus without the need to spend a turn stat boosting.</li> <li>Solganium Z allows Necrozma-DM to OHKO common switch-ins such as Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Zygarde with +1 Searing Sunraze Smash mid-game, clearing the way for its teammates.</li> <li>The extra bulk provided by 132 HP EVs allows Necrozma-DM to avoid OHKOs from some hits it otherwise wouldn't while still hitting important Speed benchmarks. For example, Necrozma-DM will survive Life Orb Marshadow's Poltergeist after Stealth Rock, defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a single layer of Spikes, and defensive Primal Kyogre's +1 Scald. With 124 Speed EVs, Necrozma-DM has the ability to outspeed uninvested base 90s with a neutral nature such as defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. At +1 Necrozma-DM outspeeds fully invested Yveltal. At +2 Necrozma-DM outspeeds nearly the entire unboosted metagame, only fearing priority moves such as Marshadow's Shadow Sneak or Yveltal's Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Alternatively, investing in 236 Speed EVs allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed fully invested base 120s at +1 such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence. If Necrozma-DM uses Dragon Dance on the switch-in, it retains the ability to OHKO Mega Salamence with Searing Sunraze Smash with minimal chip after Intimidate removes Necrozma-DM's Attack boost.</li> <li>A third EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Def / 4 SpD / 148 Spe with an Adamant nature outspeeds Zygarde, avoids a OHKO from +1 defensive Primal Kyogre's Scald, and after Stealth Rock a OHKO from Arceus-Dark's Foul Play.</li> <li>Due to a lack of recovery, Necrozma-DM needs to be cognisant of its HP, as any chip is permanent. Necrozma-DM frequently absorbs large hits while setting up or revenge killing certain threats, and taking chip may render it unable to do so. For example, Necrozma-DM always survives defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades after a layer of Spikes but can be OHKOed if Stealth Rock is also on the field.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM should not be used to fulfill the defensive duties typically associated with Necrozma-DM such as switching into an unscouted Zacian-C, though it can revenge kill them. It excels when used as a secondary check to them, with teammates such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon serving as primary checks.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM struggles heavily against offensive Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and physical Arceus-Ground. Offensive Primal Groudon is able to OHKO Necrozma-DM with its STAB moves. Marshadow is always able to revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Shadow Sneak and OHKO it with Poltergeist. Physical Arceus-Ground OHKOes Necrozma-DM with Tectonic Rage and can threaten to sweep if given the opportunity to use Dragon Dance. Zygarde is an excellent teammate on balance teams that can switch into all three of these Pokemon and provides valuable paralysis support, which allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Giratina-O is a good teammate on bulky offense teams that can switch into Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground. Necrozma-DM also appreciates the Defog and status support provided by Giratina-O.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy provides a Dark switch-in on balance teams, which helps mitigate the downside of misfiring Searing Sunraze Smash into the wrong target. It is a good check to Life Orb Yveltal, which is otherwise very threatening to balance teams and can revenge kill Necrozma-DM with Sucker Punch. Arceus-Fairy can also provide Stealth Rock and status support in the form of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic to chip opposing Pokemon into range of Necrozma-DM's attacks such as Primal Groudon, Zacian-C, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Necrozma-DM's excellent defensive typing, great stats, and movepool enable it to switch into many very powerful metagame threats, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Deoxys-A, Eternatus, and Zacian-C, and fill utility roles to support its team, such as spreading status conditions and setting Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Sunsteel Strike is a decent STAB move that hits Zacian-C, Giratina-O, and the Arceus formes. Earthquake hits foes that Necrozma-DM checks harder, like Zacian-C, Eternatus, and opposing Necrozma-DM, but it makes Necrozma-DM weaker in general and especially to foes that are immune to the move, such as Yveltal, Giratina-O, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Toxic allows Necrozma-DM to cripple checks such as Primal Groudon, offensive Arceus-Ground, Giratina-O, and Ho-Oh. Thunder Wave is an alternative to cripple Pokemon that it checks such as Eternatus, Deoxys-A, and support Arceus formes lacking Refresh and provide speed control for its allies.</li> <li>Knock Off allows Necrozma-DM to cripple foes by removing their item; in particular, it punishes Ho-Oh switching in to remove entry hazards.</li> <li>As Necrozma-DM has multiple ways to punish hazard removal attempts from Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, it is a solid Stealth Rock setter.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Zacian-C's Close Combat after Intrepid Sword, Life Orb Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock, and defensive Arceus-Ground's Judgment.</li> <li>Leftovers increases Necrozma-DM's longevity, notably cancelling out chip damage from Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is an alternative that prevents Zacian-C from trying to overwhelm Necrozma-DM's Morning Sun PP by wearing it down.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is a Pokemon that does not Terastallize often, as its innate typing already lets it handle a good portion of the metagame. After Terastallizing, Necrozma-DM becomes unable to properly check foes it's meant to cover, and its allies often make better use of the mechanic. Tera Poison lets Necrozma-DM check Zacian-C more consistently even if it Terastallizes and absorb Toxic Spikes from Eternatus. Tera Water alternatively allows Necrozma-DM to remove its regular type weaknesses and gain Fire and Water resistances, allowing it to come into Arceus-Ground, Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon in a pinch.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM can be used early-game to wall foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Zacian-C, and Eternatus and then either cripple them or set Stealth Rock, but it shouldn't be heavily relied on, as it can get worn down and be left unable to check them consistently.</li> <li>As it's used to handle several metagame threats such as Zacian-C and Deoxys-A, Necrozma-DM can get easily overwhelmed; therefore, it appreciates allies that can be secondary checks to such foes like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Multiple foes such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Marshadow can threaten Necrozma-DM, so it appreciates allies to check them, with defensive examples including Arceus-Fairy and Zygarde and offensive ones including Palkia-O, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Ground; Necrozma-DM, in return, checks foes that would force them out such as Eternatus and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Being crippled by burn, paralysis, or Knock Off from foes such as Ho-Oh, Zygarde, and Ferrothorn can compromise Necrozma-DM's consistency at checking foes; therefore, it makes a good defensive core with support Arceus formes with Refresh and Primal Groudon.</li> </ul>"

Stone Edge is used primarily to lure and OHKO Ho-Oh and also threatens Yveltal switching in, as it is 2HKOed.</li> <li>The given EV spread enables Ultra Necrozma to OHKO Eruption Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock with Earth Power and defensive Eternatus after Stealth Rock with Photon Geyser. Additionally, the given EV spread enables Photon Geyser to avoid activating Glimmora's Toxic Debris when used prior to Ultra Bursting. The defensive investment enables Ultra Necrozma to survive Choice Band Marshadow's Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>Stealth Rock Ultra Necrozma works best as a lead, but in some games, other options are preferable. Regardless, Ultra Necrozma aims to set Stealth Rock early on and lure in typical counterplay to defensive Necrozma-DM such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde. Additionally, Ultra Necrozma can also use Light That Burns the Sky to OHKO physically bulky Pokemon such as Zygarde, support Arceus formes, and Giratina-O before fainting.</li> <li>If entry hazard removal is desired, Choice Scarf Yveltal is a good fit on faster teams due to compressing the roles of a Defogger, a pivot and a revenge killer to Pokemon that threaten Ultra Necrozma such as Marshadow, Arceus, and Zacian-C. Giratina-O is also an option, as it can tailor its moveset to disrupt opposing teams through status while dealing respectable damage and appreciates Ultra Necrozma's ability to remove Pokemon that annoy it such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>As Ultra Necrozma struggles heavily with Yveltal, Calm Mind Arceus-Dark or Arceus-Fairy are excellent teammates that provide a sturdy defensive switch-in and appreciate Ultra Necrozma's ability to handle Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Alternatively, Zacian-C is an option for more aggressive teams that also revenge kills Marshadow while providing speed control.</li> <li>Eternatus is a great teammate due to absorbing and setting Toxic Spikes while also serving as a soft check to specially offensive Yveltal. In return, Eternatus appreciates Ultra Necrozma's ability to handle Primal Groudon, Zygarde, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>A combination of great offensive stats, almost unresisted STAB moves, and great coverage make Marshadow a powerful wallbreaker in offensive teams, capable of overwhelming many foes including Zygarde, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Dark. This set is best suited for offensive teams looking for a fast and powerful wallbreaker and cleaner.</li> <li>Spectral Thief steals the opponent's boosts, which is useful for scaring out targets such as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Coil Zygarde. It also bypasses Substitute, which is valuable for baiting and eliminating foes like Swords Dance Arceus-Ground attempting to use Marshadow as setup fodder. Alternatively, Ice Punch eliminates defensive Zygarde, as Poltergeist followed up by Ice Punch has a high chance to KO while preventing transformation if Zygarde switches out to scout. Otherwise, Rock Tomb deals with Ho-Oh and is a great tool to deny Mega Salamence's attempts to setup. Hidden Power Ice alongside a Naive nature always OHKOs defensive Zygarde after Spectral Thief's damage as well as Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Poltergeist is Marshadow's strongest Ghost-type STAB move, capable of 2HKOing foes such as defensive Necrozma-DM and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Low Kick is preferred over Close Combat due to the heavy weight of most foes Marshadow will face, reaching its maximum base power of 120 against staples like Arceus, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM, making it a consistent STAB move without drawbacks.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak is able to finish weakened targets that are otherwise faster than Marshadow like Ultra Necrozma, Zacian-C, and Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Ghost is the best option on Marshadow, further boosting its STAB options and allowing it to 2HKO defensive Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon with Poltergeist after Stealth Rock damage, and also ensuring it always OHKOs Ultra Necrozma after Stealth Rock with Shadow Sneak. Losing its weakness to Fairy-type attacks is also useful against Arceus-Fairy, allowing Marshadow to survive its Judgment and use another attack. Losing its resistance to Dark-type can be detrimental, however, as Yveltal can threaten to OHKO Marshadow with Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Life Orb maximizes its damage output without locking its moves like Choice Band. Due to the recoil, Marshadow is at risk of being chipped rapidly, so a Spell Tag can be used instead. The loss in power compared to Life Orb is significant, however, making Marshadow unable to KO many key targets, like Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>It is particularly good to bring Marshadow early-game because it can threaten foes such as Arceus-Dark, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh with its STAB moves and coverage. Marshadow is valuable because its moves are particularly hard to switch into, allowing it to make progress against most teams if it's well positioned.</li> <li>Entry hazards and passive damage are extremely valuable for this set, making entry hazards setters such as Primal Groudon and Eternatus valuable teammates. These Pokemon also form a defensive core that can deal with utility Arceus-Fairy, a foe that Marshadow has trouble breaking through without using Terastallization.</li> <li>Setup sweepers like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Marshadow's ability to chip key walls like Zygarde, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Dark, so they can clean a weakened team. In return, Arceus-Ground and Ultra Necrozma can handle Primal Groudon, while Arceus-Fairy can deal with Choice Scarf Yveltal, two Pokemon that Marshadow has trouble threatening.</li> </ul>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With Bulk Up increasing its already great Attack stat; a STAB combination no viable Pokemon resists; great STAB options in Poltergeist, Low Kick, Spectral Thief; and a strong priority move in Shadow Sneak further boosted by Technician, Bulk Up Marshadow is an incredible mid- to late-game wallbreaker and cleaner that can threaten a great majority of the metagame.</li> <li>Spectral Thief is a fantastic tool that not only steals boosts from common boosted threats such as Coil Zygarde, the many Calm Mind Arceus variants, and slow Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM variants but also threatens these targets for huge damage. Alternatively, Poltergeist can be used for its higher Base Power; this comes in handy with Tera Ghost, as it can OHKO defensive Primal Kyogre at +1 after Stealth Rock damage for example.</li> <li>Low Kick perfectly complements Marshadow's Ghost-type attacks and forms a nearly unresisted STAB combination. Due to the heavy weight of Pokemon in Ubers, Low Kick is preferred to Close Combat because it has no drawbacks while still having 120 Base Power against common targets like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Arceus, and Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak is a powerful tool that can eliminate Speed-boosted and naturally faster targets such as Deoxys-A, as well as weakened Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Tera Ghost is the premier choice because it further amplifies Marshadow's damage output. In particular, it allows Poltergeist to OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM at +1, OHKO Dragon Dance Zygarde at +1 and—after Stealth Rock damage—almost always 2HKO defensive Arceus-Fairy when unboosted. Turning into a pure Ghost-type also comes in handy in order to tank one hit from the likes of Arceus-Fairy and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Life Orb is the best item in order to maximize the damage Marshadow can deal. Spell Tag can also be used, granting its Ghost-type attacks a 20% damage boost with no drawbacks. The drop in power is significant, however; for example, Spell Tag Marshadow is not guaranteed to 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon at +1 with Poltergeist.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is generally recommended in order to ensure that Marshadow always outspeeds Arceus formes as well as Mega Salamence. An Adamant nature further boosts Marshadow's Attack, giving it a chance to OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM at +1 with Poltergeist.</li> <li>Marshadow likes entry hazards for their ability to hinder common switch-ins such as Arceus-Fairy, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde-C; thus, Spikes support from Primal Groudon and Toxic Spikes support from Eternatus are welcome.</li> <li>Marshadow hates switching in on entry hazards, as their damage racks up quickly when factoring its poor bulk, lack of recovery, and the possible Life Orb recoil. Thus, a Defogger like Ho-Oh or Giratina-O fits well with Marshadow. On top of that, Ho-Oh and Giratina-O can easily spread status and cripple the likes of Arceus-Fairy and Primal Groudon.</li> </ul>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Choice Band Marshadow is one of the best wallbreakers and revenge killers in the tier; thanks to its virtually unresisted STAB combination and sufficient Speed to outspeed crucial targets like Arceus and Palkia-O, it is able to 2HKO a good portion of the metagame with minimal support.</li> <li>Poltergeist easily wears down the opposing team with minimal prior momentum, notably 2HKOing defensive Eternatus, defensive Ho-Oh, and defensive Primal Kyogre. Spectral Thief is a slightly weaker yet more accurate alternative that instead discourages slower setup sweepers such as utility Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Coil Zygarde from staying on the field and is more difficult to PP stall. With the main checks to Ghost-type STAB moves from Marshadow being Arceus, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Arceus-Dark, it's viable to run both moves at once.</li> <li>Rock Tomb OHKOes Ho-Oh and provides utility to cripple foes on a predicted switch, but Ice Punch is an alternative to 2HKO Zygarde and OHKO Mega Salamence and Rayquaza.</li> <li>As most of the tier is rather heavy, Low Kick is functionally a 120-BP attack with minimal downsides.</li> <li>Tera Ghost lets Marshadow OHKO defensive Necrozma-DM with Poltergeist and 2HKO most utility Arceus formes as well as defensive Primal Groudon. Tera Ghost Spectral Thief, after Stealth Rock, can also OHKO wallbreaker Primal Kyogre and 2HKO defensive Arceus-Fairy. Terastallizing also ensures that Shadow Sneak OHKOes Mewtwo and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Marshadow is best used in the mid-game once the opposing checks to either its Ghost- or Fighting-type STAB moves have been taken care of or put into OHKO range for Marshadow. In such a scenario, or if the opposing team lacks such checks, Marshadow can use the same move multiple times without being punished as a result of becoming Choice-locked, capitalizing on breaking defensive cores to eventually pave the way for a sweep.</li> <li>Against hyper offense, Marshadow is a potent revenge killer thanks to its immunity to Extreme Speed and its priority in Shadow Sneak, which threatens faster foes such as Ultra Necrozma, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Deoxys-A; therefore, it's desirable to keep Marshadow for long-term use when facing such teams.</li> <li>Because Marshadow can't consistently handle foes such as Ultra Necrozma, Zacian-C, and Yveltal, checks such as Arceus-Fairy, Primal Groudon, and Ditto make for good allies. In return, Marshadow offensively pressures foes such as Primal Kyogre and Eternatus for them.</li> <li>As Marshadow is rather frail for the tier, it appreciates pivots such as Yveltal and Alomomola to let it safely enter the field. More offensive teams may instead want a suicide lead such as Glimmora or Shuckle, as they provide a safe switch upon being KOed and let Marshadow KO more foes with the extra damage from entry hazards or the support from Sticky Web.</li> </ul>"

It also doubles as an excellent Extreme Killer Arceus check, which can give teammates like Primal Kyogre trouble. However, Melmetal relies on Tera in order to beat its checks and can have PP issues with Double Iron Bash.</li> <li>Ice Punch provides valuable coverage that OHKOs Mega Salamence and Zygarde. Thunder Punch allows Melmetal to wallbreak past bulky Water types such as Dondozo, Arceus-Water, Primal Kyogre, and Alomomola while also threatening to 2HKO Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Superpower allows Melmetal to OHKO specially defensive Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn sets with Protect can be harder to KO, though, as it will scout with Protect and switch into an appropriate answer. Earthquake allows Melmetal to 2HKO Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids an OHKO from Life Orb Marshadow's Low Kick, defensive Primal Kyogre's +1 Scald, and Tera Dark Yveltal's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock. The rest is invested in Attack to maximize damage output.</li> <li>Tera Steel skyrockets Melmetal’s wallbreaking power and invalidates previous switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM by turning previous 3HKOs to 2HKOs.</li> <li>Melmetal usually only wants to use Double Iron Bash, as its coverage moves can easily be maneuvered around, so it is best to use Melmetal as a late-game sweeper once checks such as Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde have been severely chipped or removed. If used too early, Melmetal’s checks will easily stall Trick Room turns and Double Iron Bash PP. Teammates such as Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon should use the initial Trick Room instead to wear down checks such as Alomomola and Ferrothorn for Melmetal.</li> <li>Once Trick Room ends, it is important to switch Melmetal out to a bulky Trick Room setter such as Cresselia and Arceus, as Melmetal is easily revenge killed outside of Trick Room. In certain situations, though, it may be best to sacrifice Melmetal once Trick Room ends, such as when another sweeper is in an excellent position to sweep and a setter like Arceus needs all of its HP to set Trick Room up safely against a threat like Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Cresselia, Hatterene, and Arceus are extremely valuable teammates that set Trick Room and provide Lunar Dance and Healing Wish support. Cresselia can switch into Ground-type attacks from Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon for Melmetal thanks to Levitate. In addition, Cresselia provides a way to restore Double Iron Bash’s PP thanks to Lunar Dance, which Healing Wish is unable to do. This allows Melmetal to be used mid-game to weaken its checks without worrying about Double Iron Bash PP. Hatterene is an excellent lead Trick Room setter that denies entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Arceus is an extremely consistent late-game Trick Room setter due to its bulk and can revenge kill weakened opponents with Extreme Speed.</li> <li>Melmetal can struggle to break past bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM, so Primal Groudon is an excellent teammate. Primal Kyogre is also very helpful, as it helps break past bulky Water-types such as Dondozo, Tera Water Zygarde, and Alomomola, which Melmetal and other Trick Room staples cannot break past. Calyrex-I also does well with Melmetal, as the two have similar checks such as Necrozma-DM, Alomomola, Dondozo, and Tera Water Zygarde. Both Calyrex-I and Melmetal can wear down their shared checks and position the other to sweep. However, there is an opportunity cost of running Calyrex-I over Primal Groudon or Primal Kyogre. Without Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn can waste Trick Room turns and spam Leech Seed without much risk, while without Primal Kyogre, Tera Water Zygarde can easily wall the entire team after a Coil.</li> </ul>"

Thanks to its low Speed, it can easily use Healing Wish or deal respectable damage under Trick Room to reduce passivity.</li> <li>Dazzling Gleam allows Hatterene to punish threats such as Zygarde and Mega Salamence that would otherwise easily set up on it. This often can bait out Tera Water or Fairy from Zygarde, allowing teammates such as Primal Kyogre and Melmetal to take advantage of this.</li> <li>Nuzzle allows Hatterene to cripple threats that would attempt to set up on it such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM that hasn’t used Ultra Burst yet. However, it may make threats such as defensive Primal Kyogre faster than teammates such as Primal Groudon and Calyrex-I under Trick Room. Mystical Fire prevents Calm Mind Arceus formes from setting up on Hatterene. It also greatly threatens Ferrothorn, which gives many Trick Room team trouble. In addition, it 2HKOes Zacian-C and deals respectable damage to Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, discouraging setup and leaving both of them in range to be KOed by Tera Ice Glacial Lance Calyrex-I and Tera Steel Double Iron Bash Melmetal.</li> <li>The given EV spread maximizes Hatterene’s Special Attack to threaten Pokemon like Zygarde and Mega Salamence while avoiding a 2HKO from Dragon Dance Zygarde's Thousand Arrows.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Hatterene to escape trapping from Gothitelle. This is useful in situations where Magic Bounce would be useful throughout the game, such as when the opponent has a persistent entry hazard setter such as Ferrothorn. In most cases, Hatterene does not need to Tera and instead should save it for teammates such as Melmetal and Calyrex-I that need it to break past their checks.</li> <li>Hatterene should be used as a designated lead. On turn 1, Trick Room should be used almost always to take advantage of its Focus Sash and minimize risk of failing to set up. Against Pokemon that don’t immediately threaten it, such as Zygarde and Ferrothorn, Hatterene can instead use Dazzling Gleam or Mystical Fire to weaken these threats or force a Tera. On turn 2, Hatterene should usually use Healing Wish to create momentum and provide support for its teammates. However, it may be best to stay in against entry hazard leads such as Glimmora and defensive Primal Groudon. This allows Hatterene to punish these leads for using Spikes or Stealth Rock predicting Hatterene would use Healing Wish.</li> <li>Hatterene’s ability to deny entry hazards early-game is essential for Trick Room teams, especially as most don’t have a form of hazard removal. This is significant for Calyrex-I, as it is harder for Extreme Speed Arceus and Shadow Sneak Marshadow to revenge kill it. Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre also appreciate this, as Eruption and Water Sprout being at full power greatly aids them in wallbreaking.</li> <li>Pokemon that appreciate Trick Room support such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre make excellent teammates. Calyrex-I is an essential bulky and strong wallbreaker on Trick Room teams that greatly benefits from Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field for it.</li> <li>Hatterene needs other Trick Room setters as teammates, as it isn’t sufficient to facilitate sweepers throughout the game, so Cresselia and Arceus make excellent partners.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li>Defensive Eternatus stands out as a top-tier defensive staple, as it is able to completely wall Arceus-Dark, is immune to Toxic, and can simultaneously serve as one of the few Knock Off absorbers in the tier. Its Speed tier allows it to outpace Arceus formes and Marshadow while maintaining enough bulk to withstand hits and provide a soft check against threats like Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre. Moreover, Pressure enables Eternatus to PP stall moves like Water Spout from Primal Kyogre, Judgment from Arceus-Fairy, Sacred Fire and Defog from Ho-Oh, and Dynamax Cannon from opposing Eternatus. Finally, its capability to spread status adds another layer of utility, making Eternatus a premier choice for balanced team compositions.</li> <li>Toxic Spikes in conjunction with Pressure gives Eternatus a distinct advantage in breaking opposing teams, thanks to its ability to set entry hazards and PP stall Defog from prevalent Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Toxic serves as a potent tool for gradually wearing down Pokemon such as Calm Mind Primal Kyogre without Rest, Yveltal, and Arceus. Additionally, it ensures gradual damage against defensive Arceus formes lacking Refresh, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb finds its primary utility in targeting Arceus-Fairy. Additionally, it offers the potential to poison Pokemon that are immune to Toxic Spikes, notably Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, which would otherwise clear entry hazards against Eternatus.</li> <li>Flamethrower acts as a countermeasure against Steel-types, such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, that would attempt to take advantage of Eternatus, since they are immune to being poisoned. Alternatively, Mystical Fire serves a similar purpose by punishing Steel-types while also limiting Calm Mind Arceus formes. However, it's important to note that Mystical Fire's damage output is weaker than Flamethrower, and as a result, Mystical Fire fails to secure a 2HKO against Zacian-C after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is also favored as a tool against Necrozma-DM, since it has the potential to inflict a burn, rendering Mystical Fire less effective.</li> <li>Combining Toxic with Toxic Spikes forms another viable strategy that affects all prevalent Defoggers immune to Toxic Spikes, making it easier to maintain entry hazards throughout the match. However, relying solely on these moves without coverage options can leave Eternatus vulnerable against Steel-types like Necrozma DM, Magearna, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Leftovers is the preferred item to help Eternatus handle burns from Ho-Oh and mitigate the damage from attacks such as Ice Beam from Primal Kyogre and most attacks from Marshadow. Heavy-Duty Boots serves as a good alternative to avoid entry hazard damage, particularly if the team lacks Defoggers.</li> <li>Eternatus's EV spread enables it to outspeed a fully invested Yveltal while not being 2HKOed by specially offensive Yveltal's Dark Pulse and Choice Band Marshadow's Spectral Thief. An EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpD / 176 Spe with a Timid nature makes it possible for Eternatus to outspeed fully invested Arceus formes while still not be 2HKOed by specially offensive Yveltal's Dark Pulse at the cost of physical bulk. An alternative spread of 40 HP / 252 Def / 216 Spe, which is faster than Marshadow, can deal with physical threats such as Ho-Oh, Marshadow, and Arceus. However, another dedicated wall is necessary to check specially offensive threats like Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Tera Fairy enhances Eternatus's capability against Palkia-O, Life Orb Yveltal, Giratina-O, and Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, while Tera Water improves Eternatus's matchup against Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Eternatus should freely switch into Yveltal and Ho-Oh lacking Thunder Wave and aim to set up Toxic Spikes to threaten Primal Groudon and defensive Arceus formes. It's best to reserve Terastallization as a last resort, since it compromises Eternatus's valuable Toxic immunity.</li> <li>Ho-Oh synergizes well with Eternatus, especially in the presence of Toxic Spikes, as it can phaze foes with Whirlwind and provides an immunity to Ground. Arceus-Dark is another good partner since it can deal with Necrozma-DM, which is immune to Toxic, and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is another excellent choice as a teammate, offering the ability to safely switch in against Primal Groudon and Marshadow. Additionally, a specially defensive Zygarde-C can utilize Glare against opposing Eternatus, ensuring that it maintains the speed advantage. Giratina is another valuable teammate that is capable of dealing with Primal Groudon. It also has Pressure, which significantly enhances the PP stall strategy when paired with Eternatus.</li> <li>When utilizing physically defensive Eternatus, it's crucial to include another Primal Kyogre check on the team, such as Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, or Chansey. Ferrothorn can offer valuable entry hazard support by setting up Spikes and Stealth Rock, and it appreciates Eternatus switching in to handle Ho-Oh. Additionally, Chansey can effectively handle most special attackers and use Heal Bell to cure eventual paralysis on Eternatus, further increasing Eternatus's longevity throughout the match.</li> </ul>"

      "Meteor Beam": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Meteor Beam Eternatus is a very potent threat that fully exploits its offensive potential while keeping some of its good defensive traits thanks to its Poison typing, which allows it to come in and absorb Toxic Spikes and Toxic.</li> <li>Not only does Meteor Beam boost Eternatus's already good Special Attack, it also lures in and removes Ho-Oh while dealing great damage to targets such as Yveltal, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon is the premier STAB move of choice for Eternatus, and it's preferred over Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse because despite its low PP, it has high Base Power and no drawbacks, and it also keeps key KOs. For example, after a Meteor Beam boost, Eternatus can 2HKO specially defensive Primal Groudon with Dynamax Cannon as well as 2HKO Primal Kyogre with the move after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is important to remove Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy, which can otherwise easily survive what Eternatus throws at them and use it as setup fodder. Spreading poison with this move is also useful to hinder some of its soft checks, like Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Flamethrower covers Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, which takes pitiful damage from Dynamax Cannon and Meteor Beam and can force Eternatus out by setting up with Dragon Dance or crippling it with Thunder Wave. Fire Blast can be used for its higher Base Power in order to take out defensive Necrozma-DM as well as Zacian-C at +1.</li> <li>A Timid nature is crucial in order to outrun unboosted Ultra Necrozma and certain threats like Arceus, Mega Salamence, and Marshadow. It also Speed ties with opposing offensive Eternatus.</li> <li>Tera Dragon further increases Dynamax Cannon's damage output, allowing Eternatus to menace key threats. For example, +1 Tera Dragon Dynamax Cannon can 2HKO Tera Water Zygarde-C and can OHKO it prior to Power Construct after a layer of Spikes. It also 2HKOes Ho-Oh and OHKOes Marshadow, and it additionally OHKOes defensive Arceus-Ground after a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Tera Dragon also suppresses Eternatus's weaknesses associated with its Poison typing, letting Eternatus survive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades, Ultra Necrozma's Photon Geyser, and Arceus-Ground's Judgment.</li> <li>Tera Fire turns the tables against Zacian-C, allowing Eternatus to not only survive any hits from it but also OHKO Zacian-C with Fire Blast without a boost. Tera Fire Eternatus can also benefit from its new resistance to Fairy-type attacks to serve as a check in a pinch to other Fairy-types like Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Meteor Beam Eternatus fits best on offensive teams that are looking for a mid- to late-game wallbreaker and cleaner with sufficient Speed to outrun common threats to offensive teams like unboosted Ultra Necrozma. Cleaners like Double Dance Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus as well as wallbreakers like offensive Calm Mind Primal Kyogre and Ultra Necrozma appreciate the support of Eternatus chipping their shared checks like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Sticky Web support from teammates like Smeargle, Shuckle, and Ribombee further increases Eternatus's ability to threaten common anti-offense Pokemon like Dragon Dance Ultra Necrozma, allowing it to outrun and remove them.</li> </ul>"

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Wallbreaker Eternatus is an immensely threatening wallbreaker, and not only maintains resiliency to passive damage that would wear down other offensive sets against bulkier teams but also lacks the passivity of defensive sets. This amalgamation of offensive and defensive traits provides valuable role compression for many bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate Eternatus's consistency against both offensive and defensive playstyles.</li> <li>Recover provides Eternatus immense flexibility relative to other offensive sets. Eternatus often finds turns to use Recover on the switches it forces or against more passive Pokemon that struggle to meaningfully damage it such as Ho-Oh, Ferrothorn, or Yveltal attempting to KO with Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Meteor Beam provides Eternatus with the ability to easily remove Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Meteor Beam also dissuades Pokemon that would otherwise switch into Eternatus such as Primal Kyogre or Primal Groudon, as they are unable to handle Eternatus's boosted attacks afterwards.</li> <li>Fire Blast is used over Flamethrower for increased damage, notably OHKOing Zacian-C at +1 and being able to 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM. Fire-type coverage is run to easily handle Steel-types and Pokemon that utilize Tera Steel that would wall or set up on Eternatus such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is the primary Tera type used. It enables Eternatus to comfortably switch into specially offensive Yveltal and prevents it from being revenge killed by Ditto. Eternatus can also Terastallize in a pinch to remove its Ground weakness against Pokemon aiming to revenge kill it such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground. Eternatus's newfound Dragon immunity also helps against Giratina-O, Palkia-O, and opposing Eternatus.</li> <li>Eternatus tends to enter the battle mid-game against defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, utility Arceus-Fairy, and Ferrothorn. Eternatus can use these as an opportunity to boost, wallbreak, or both. It does not need to micromanage its health, as it often finds opportunities to use Recover against defensive Pokemon, so it is capable of sponging a hit beyond what is required in order to set up. Eternatus also has a great matchup into stall teams, as Chansey is often left with too little PP to stave off other special attackers such as Primal Kyogre after dealing with Eternatus thanks to Pressure.</li> <li>Alomomola is a fantastic teammate for Eternatus thanks to its ability to provide a slow pivot into Pokemon that Eternatus can beat. but is otherwise hesitant to switch directly into, such as Zygarde and defensive Eternatus. Zygarde is also an excellent partner for Eternatus, as it is the tier's best blanket physical wall to handle Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Tera Blast Ground Zacian-C. Zygarde's paralysis support also enables Eternatus to easily revenge kill Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Ultra Necrozma with minimal risk.</li> <li>Choice Band Marshadow can handle the few specially defensive Pokemon that Eternatus struggles with such as Calm Mind Arceus formes and defensive Primal Kyogre. Zacian-C is another option, which handles Calm Mind Arceus formes that can otherwise use Eternatus for setup fodder.</li> </ul>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With a Speed tier that outpaces most of the metagame and the capability to often come in against common foes such as Ho-Oh and utility Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dark and apply considerable offensive pressure, Eternatus is a potent wallbreaker that can overwhelm defensive cores commonly found in balance teams, KOing foes across multiple moments of a battle for the bulky offense and balance teams it's usually found on.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon 2HKOes foes such as defensive Ho-Oh after minimal chip damage, defensive Primal Groudon, and defensive Yveltal; it also provides a consistent way to deal damage to foes attempting to scout Eternatus with switches.</li> <li>Draco Meteor OHKOes defensive Zygarde-C, Eruption Primal Groudon, and 2HKOes support Arcues formes while also giving Eternatus the option to overwhelm checks such as Ho-Oh thanks to its sheer power, making it difficult for them to heal off the damage and scout it. Sludge Bomb allows Eternatus to OHKO Arceus-Fairy after Stealth Rock, and it can cripple checks such as Ho-Oh with its poison chance. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes capitalizes on the offensive pressure Eternatus exerts on Pokemon such as Arceus-Dark and defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Fire Blast allows Eternatus to handle Steel-types, as it always 2HKOes defensive Necrozma-DM while OHKOing Zacian-C and the more niche Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Tera Dragon Draco Meteor OHKOes defensive Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo Y, defensive Yveltal, and, after Stealth Rock, Extreme Killer Arceus and utility Arceus formes. Tera Dragon Dynamax Cannon also achieves results such as 2HKOing defensive Ho-Oh and defensive Primal Kyogre while retaining offensive pressure unlike Draco Meteor. Terastallizing prevents Eternatus from absorbing Toxic Spikes and makes it vulnerable to Toxic from Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Dark, so it's best to be used when it's to ensure an OHKO to enable its team for a sweep later on.</li> <li>Eternatus's innate bulk enables it to come in early-game against foes such as Arceus-Dark and defensive Ho-Oh and make progress offensively. If running Toxic Spikes, Eternatus can a defensive set and can net a surprise KO against foes such as Yveltal, Primal Groudon, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>While Fire Blast mitigates this issue, Eternatus can struggle with Steel-types such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, so allies that can check them such as defensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground are good options.</li> <li>Faster foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A can revenge kill Eternatus. Offensive partners such as Marshadow and Arceus can make formidable offensive cores that check them with priority moves, while Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, and Ho-Oh can withstand hits for Eternatus.</li> <li>As it forces a lot of switches, Eternatus appreciates entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Ferrothorn, and Necrozma-DM to deal a lot of chip damage as the match progresses.</li> </ul>"

      "Shuca Berry": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Shuca Berry Eternatus fully maximizes its poison-spreading potential, being able to use Toxic and set Toxic Spikes on Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground with relative safety after luring them in. Shuca Berry also comes with the added benefit of letting Eternatus check Choice Band Marshadow much more effectively, as once it is used, Poltergeist will be unable to hit it. This set still performs defensive Eternatus’ s standard roles effectively as a check to foes such as Calm Mind Arceus sets lacking Refresh and Yveltal, but it can struggle long term against Arceus-Fairy and Life Orb Yveltal due to being prone to being worn down without Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Furthermore, as it is unable to use both Dynamax Cannon and Flamethrower, it can be used as setup fodder for Zacian-C, Necrozma-DM, or opposing Eterrnatus depending on its choice.</li> <li>With Shuca Berry, Eternatus can safely stay in on Ground-types like Primal Groudon and use Toxic against it, and it also is key to pressuring Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus sets, letting Eternatus constantly set Toxic Spikes against them. Toxic also allows Eternatus to wear down Calm Mind Primal Kyogre and Zygarde, forcing them to use Rest more frequently. Toxic Spikes lets Eternatus put pressure on defensive Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre, wearing them down and enabling its teammates to break through them more easily.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon lets Eternatus directly hit Ground-types like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh, and it most importantly dissuades opposing Eternatus from switching in and absorbing its Toxic Spikes. Flamethrower can be used if Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are an issue to the team but makes the set less effective overall due to the lack of a STAB option, as it is harder to pressure Ho-Oh and Zygarde.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Eternatus to avoid the 2HKO from Zygarde’s Thousand Arrows with Shuca Berry, avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Yveltal’s Dark Pulse, and outspeed specially offensive Yveltal.</li> <li>Tera Fairy lets Eternatus take Dragon-type attacks from opposing Eternatus and Palkia-O while also being an all-around great defensive type that turns its former Ground and Psychic weaknesses into neutralities and keeps its Fighting resistance against Marshadow.</li> <li>Shuca Berry Eternatus works best early- to mid-game, as if it can lure Primal Groudon or Arceus-Ground with Toxic, it can start putting a lot of pressure on the opposing team. Using its item early is also the best case scenario when fighting a Marshadow so it can pivot into it without worry. Hard switching in Eternatus is often discouraged, as it can lose its Shuca Berry and be KOed after without being able to use Toxic or Dynamax Cannon. Toxic Spikes can easily be set up, as Eternatus can pressure all Defoggers by way of Toxic and Dynamax Cannon.</li> <li>This set works best on balance and bulky offense structures that appreciate Eternatus spreading poison on Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, greatly cutting into their longevity.</li> <li>Shuca Berry Eternatus works best with teammates that greatly appreciate Ground-types being poisoned or KOed, such as Calm Mind Arceus-Water, Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy, and offensive Primal Groudon. Eternatus is easily worn down by entry hazards, so teammates that can remove them like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Giratina-O are great partners. Eternatus must be paired with good Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM checks if running Dynamax Cannon, so defensive Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C are good teammates. If running Flamethrower, then teams must have a way to pressure or take advantage of opposing Eternatus such as Choice Band Marshadow or offensive Yveltal.</li> </ul>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Life Orb Eternatus is a niche offensive variant that trades its longevity and ability to soft check foes like Marshadow and Primal Kyogre to instead enhance its offensive capabilities. Its biggest draw lies in the immediate and dependable power boost granted to its attacks, allowing Eternatus to wallbreak multiple times throughout a game without relying on the two-turn nature of Meteor Beam. Its ability to harass bulky structures while also sporting a decent matchup against hyper offense makes it a worthwhile addition to balance and bulky offense teams alike.</li> <li>Dynamax Cannon is Eternatus’s STAB move of choice, with consistent damage output to net crucial 2HKOs against many defensive targets. This allows Eternatus to pressure foes such as Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and Zygarde; after one layer of Spikes, opposing Eternatus and support Arceus formes are brought into OHKO and 2HKO range respectively.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb threatens Arceus-Fairy with major damage while crippling targets with its valuable poison chance, making switch-ins such as Ho-Oh unable to stave off repeated blows long-term. If such targets are well-handled by its teammates, Toxic Spikes can instead be used to punish switches by setting grounded threats like Lunala, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre on a timer.</li> <li>Fire Blast decimates Steel-types attempting to switch into its STAB moves, notably OHKOing Zacian-C and 2HKOing defensive Necrozma-DM after a layer of Spikes, while blasting apart Ferrothorn without the need for entry hazards.</li> <li>Recover takes advantage of forced switches to reliably heal Eternatus from chip damage and Life Orb recoil, allowing it to switch out and remain healthy enough to wallbreak at a later point in the match.</li> <li>Tera Dragon launches Dynamax Cannon to new heights, letting Eternatus 2HKO Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Tera Water or Poison Zygarde as well as OHKOing most offensive Primal Groudon variants after Stealth Rock. Tera Dragon secondarily sheds crucial weaknesses to Ground and Psychic, allowing Eternatus to take on threats such as Arceus-Ground, Primal Groudon, and an unboosted Ultra Necrozma at the cost of becoming vulnerable to Toxic.</li> <li>Tera Fire is an alternative that boosts its coverage, letting Eternatus more easily dispatch Zacian-C and offensive Necrozma-DM with a nuclear Fire Blast. Defensively, Tera Fire improves the matchup against Fairy- and Ice-types, allowing Eternatus to better check a boosted Arceus-Fairy and Choice-locked Chien-Pao as well as dodging Sacred Fire burns from Ho-Oh in a pinch, at the expense of a newfound weakness to Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Eternatus functions well as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker as well as a cleaner owing to its excellent Speed and offensive presence. However, its inability to safely switch into Poltergeist and Knock Off users in addition to demanding careful HP management due to Life Orb recoil means Eternatus appreciates pivoting support from offensive and defensive allies alike to find opportunities to safely enter the battle; therefore, Pokemon such as Yveltal, Mega Latios, and Alomomola synergize well with it.</li> <li>Eternatus appreciates allies that can set hazards to facilitate its wallbreaking, making teammates such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Water, and Ferrothorn excellent partners; the former two pressure Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal with the threat of status moves and super effective coverage, while the latter punishes support Arceus formes and Giratina-O with Leech Seed.</li> <li>This set struggles against stall teams due to its low-PP moves as well as Life Orb recoil inevitably forfeiting momentum to use Recover, so teammates such as Choice Band Rayquaza and Overheat Primal Groudon help Eternatus in overwhelming special walls like Chansey and Ho-Oh, while Eternatus threatens Dondozo and Arceus-Dark in return. Rayquaza is a particularly useful ally due to its access to U-turn, allowing Eternatus to safely enter the field and wreak havoc.</li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Glacial Lance and High Horsepower enable Calyrex-I to 2HKO the entire tier, with the exception of bulky Water-types such as defensive Primal Kyogre, Dondozo, and Tera Water Zygarde. The immediate threat that Calyrex-I poses enables it to function as a cataclysmic wallbreaker on balance and bulky offense teams. Additionally, Trick Room teams dedicated to supporting Calyrex-I are able to scrape out a niche due to the immense power and snowball potential of Tera Ice Glacial Lance.</li> <li>Trick is useful against stall and balance teams to neuter common switch-ins such as Dondozo and Tera Water Zygarde. Calyrex-I benefits from the lack of a Choice lock and is able to transition to a more supportive role while retaining an offensive presence. Additionally, Aromatherapy is useful against stall and some bulkier balance teams to take advantage of the many Pokemon Calyrex-I scares out such as defensive Eternatus and Ferrothorn. On dedicated Trick Room teams, Seed Bomb is used to 2HKO bulky Water-types such as defensive Primal Kyogre, which would otherwise be able to survive Glacial Lance if Calyrex has not yet obtained an Attack boost from As One. Seed Bomb is particularly useful against Tera Water Zygarde, which is troublesome for Trick Room teams in general, as Calyrex-I, Melmetal, and Primal Groudon struggle to overwhelm it.</li> <li>The EV spread avoids an OHKO from Arceus-Dark's Foul Play while also maximizing mixed bulk. Thanks to this investment and Calyrex-I's naturally high bulk, it can tank many strong attacks despite its poor defensive typing. For example, Calyrex-I is 2HKOed by Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike after a single layer of Spikes and Double Dance Primal Groudon's Heat Crash after Stealth Rock and 2 layers of Spikes.</li> <li>On dedicated Trick Room teams, Calyrex-I runs a more specialized EV spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 SpD, which enables Calyrex-I to survive a wide range of attacks. For example, Calyrex-I is 2HKOed by Tera Flying Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent, +2 Silk Scarf Tera Normal Arceus's Extreme Speed, Life Orb Tera Ghost Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball, and +1 Tera Fighting Zacian-C's Close Combat after Stealth Rock chip. Furthermore, Calyrex-I is 3HKOed by defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and defensive Primal Kyogre's Scald.</li> <li>Tera Steel is Calyrex-I's prefered Tera type, as Calyrex-I appreciates the resistances provided by its new Steel typing, and the poison immunity and resistance to Stealth Rock enchance Calyrex-I's crucial role as a cleric against stall teams. Additionally, Tera Steel can prevent late-game sweeps against some threats on hyper offense teams, as Calyrex-I survives Arceus's Extreme Speed after 2 rounds of Stealth Rock pre-tera; +1 Ultra Necrozma's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock while retaining a resistance to Light That Burns the Sky; and Eternatus's Meteor Beam or +1 Dynamax Cannon. Alternatively, Tera Fire provides Calyrex-I with a burn immunity, which is particularly valuable because many teams will rely on Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire or Arceus-Dark's Will-O-Wisp to answer Calyrex-I. This does, however, significantly hinder Calyrex-I's longevity and efficacy as a cleric against stall teams due to its Stealth Rock weakness and poorer defensive profile.</li> <li>Tera Ice is only used on dedicated Trick Room teams. The defensive purposes served by Tera Steel and Fire mentioned above are irrelevant, as Calyrex-I relies on Tera Ice to secure several important OHKOs and make use of limited Trick Room turns and snowball. For example, Eruption Primal Groudon is OHKOed by Tera Ice Glacial Lance, and at +1, OHKOs Wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, Zacian-C, Tera Fairy Zygarde, and most utility Arceus formes.</li> <li>Calyrex-I's role and presence on a game-to-game basis is heavily dependent on the style of team it is facing. Calyrex-I has the most presence in games against stall teams, as it can use Trick to swap its Choice Band onto Dondozo, its most common switch-in, heavily hindering it for the duration of the game. With Tera Steel, Calyrex-I functions as an excellent cleric and easily finds many turns to use Aromatherpy because most Pokemon on stall teams outside of Ho-Oh are unable to meaningfully threaten it, preventing stall's main method of making progress.</li> <li>Calyrex-I plays a smaller role in games against balance and more offensive teams. Calyrex-I's natural bulk enables it to trade with a large portion of the metagame. Against balance teams, Calyrex-I is often a great lead due to the threat it poses to common leads such as defensive Primal Groudon lacking Overheat and Arceus-Ground. Calyrex-I is also able to effectively trade late-game if needed against Pokemon such as Specially Offensive Yveltal after it has Terastallized. Calyrex-I is a poor lead into hyper offense teams and is often best saved until end-game where it can leverage its bulk and Terastallization to knock out boosted Pokemon such as Arceus and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>On dedicated Trick Room teams, Calyrex-I is used as a mid- and end-game sweeper. Calyrex-I should not be used under the initial Trick Room, as it requires teammates such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre to soften or remove potential checks such as Zygarde and Alomomola.</li> <li>On balance teams, Calyrex-I requires Defog support, as Stealth Rock often leaves Calyrex-I in a position where it is easily revenge killed. For example, Calyrex-I is always OHKOed by Primal Kyogre's Origin Pulse after Stealth Rock. Consequently, Ho-Oh is a fantastic partner due to its consistency at keeping the field clear of entry hazards. Overheat defensive Primal Groudon is a fantastic partner as it sets entry hazards, threatens Dondozo, and is a good switch-in to Pokemon that threaten Calyrex-I such as Zacian-C. Defensive Primal Kyogre synergizes particularly well with Calyrex-I due to its good matchup into defensive teams, while the cleric support Calyrex-I provides enables Primal Kyogre to use Rest against more offensive teams.</li> <li>Hatterene is a mandatory teammate and dedicated lead on Trick Room teams due to Magic Bounce denying most entry hazard setters and providing Healing Wish support. Calyrex-I appreciates Arceus and Cresselia as additional Trick Room setters. Arceus's access to Taunt can prevent entry hazards, which would heavily impede Calyrex-I's ability to sweep, while Cresselia's Lunar Dance remedies Glacial Lance's low PP. Although Calyrex-I threatens most of the metagame with Tera Ice Glacial Lance, it relies on teammates such as Eruption Primal Groudon and wallbreaker Primal Kyogre to help with Pokemon that it cannot break through such as Arceus-Water and Dondozo.</li> </ul>"

Basculegion-M’s viability is tied to it being the strongest user of Last Respects, letting it OHKO or 2HKO almost the entire tier when it's the last Pokemon. Bulky Ghost-resistant Pokemon such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark can also be 2HKOed by 300-Base Power Last Respects, leaving only Arceus as a safe switch-in. While fast, Basculegion-M is still outsped by Zacian-C and Deoxys-S, so it can only sweep once both of those Pokemon have fainted.</li> <li>Wave Crash lets Basculegion-M wear down Arceus, 2HKOing it after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Blast Fighting puts even more pressure on Arceus, being able to OHKO it after some chip damage while also 2HKOing bulkier variants of Arceus-Dark, which is important because both otherwise prevent Last Respects from being a roll.</li> <li>Flip Turn can be used to generate momentum if Arceus switches in or if Arceus-Dark or Yveltal switch in if Last Respects is not at full power. Aqua Jet lets Basculegion-M pick off threats like a weakened Arceus-Ground that outspeeds it after a Dragon Dance.</li> <li>Tera Fighting makes Basculegion-M resistant to Yveltal’s Sucker Punch and neutral to Marshadow's Shadow Sneak, preventing it from being revenge killed by them; it also synergizes best with Tera Blast to hit Arceus harder than Wave Crash.</li> <li>Basculegion-M should almost always be sent out once most, if not all, of its teammates have fainted, maximizing Last Respect’s power. Generally, using Basculegion-M is fairly straightforward, as 300-Base Power Last Respects should OHKO everything left, but it has to Terastallize in order to beat a healthy defensive Yveltal or Arceus-Dark. If Arceus is on the opposing team, the main priority would be to either KO it with a partner like Arceus-Ground or Deoxys-A or poison it such as with Glimmora's Toxic Spikes, limiting its longevity.</li> <li>Due to Basculegion-M’s susceptibility to priority, it functions best on Psychic Spam teams utilizing Tapu Lele and Deoxys-A to punch holes early on. Glimmora is a solid partner, as it can set Toxic Spikes and Spikes to wear down Arceus and Arceus-Dark, enabling Basculegion to sweep in the late game.</li> <li>Sticky Web teams with Shuckle or Smeargle can also utilize Basculegion, as the Sticky Webs let Basculegion outspeed Deoxys-A and Zacian-C, as well as other boosted Pokemon. Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma are great partners, as they lure and remove both Yveltal and Arceus-Dark easily.</li> <li>While Basculegion-M is strong, it is still unable to OHKO extremely physically bulky Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and defensive Primal Groudon, so the aforementioned entry hazards help wear them down, alongside teammates that put pressure on them like Taunt Arceus-Ground and Zacian-C.</li> </ul>"

Tera Fairy makes Garganacl hard wall Marshadow, support Arceus-Dark, and Giratina-O, and grants an immunity to Dragon Tail from foes such as Giratina-O and Zygarde, letting Garganacl preserve Iron Defense boosts.</li> <li>Garganacl's main priority is to spread Salt Cure, wearing down the opposing team and granting its allies momentum as the opposing team is put into uncomfortable positions. Mid-game, Garganacl can be used as a check to physical attackers, as its status-absorbing capabilities also let it easily come into foes such as Ho-Oh, Alomomola, and Giratina-O. Late-game, it may try to apply offensive pressure with IronPress to threaten a sweep, as special attackers that can threaten Garganacl such as Yveltal and Eternatus are more vulnerable to Garganacl after getting worn down.</li> <li>Against offensive team structures, Garganacl can find use against foes it can wall such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Rayquaza thanks to the IronPress combination, preventing it from being as easy to overwhelm on the physical side as it forces a switch, but if the momentum is disfavorable for it, Garganacl can still be used to hinder setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Kyogre, and Zacian-C, putting them on a timer and preventing them from doing much else without sacrificing momentum.</li> <li>Garganacl has a positive matchup against the most common entry hazard removers in the metagame, notably including Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, so its presence can actively discourage them from entering the field, meaning that entry hazard setters such as Eternatus, Primal Groudon, and Ferrothorn make formidable allies.</li> <li>Garganacl is generally vulnerable to special attackers such as Yveltal, Arceus-Fairy, and Primal Kyogre, so checks to them such as defensive Eternatus and Ferrothorn are notable options to mitigate this issue. Zacian-C is also a notable partner that can put offensive pressure on Garganacl's checks such as the previously mentioned foes.</li> <li>Unless it has already Terastallized, Garganacl is vulnerable to Ground- and Fighting-type foes such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Marshadow. Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Yveltal act as switch-ins to them for Garganacl to rely on early-game, with Garganacl in return limiting the longevity of their checks such as Chien-Pao and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> </ul>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Garganacl is an excellent option for bulkier balance teams in search of a resilient hazard setter. It is one of the best punishers of Defog in the tier and consequently is excellent at winning the hazard war. Garcanacl's excellent bulk, use of Tera, and ability to force progress via Salt Cure makes it a sturdy part of defensive cores. Unfortunately, Garganacl's reliance on Terastallizing requires specific support and hinders its splashability. As such, Garganacl works best when built with it in mind rather than slapping it on a team, especially given that its Tera type plays a huge role in what it is able to check.</li> <li>Salt Cure has scarce switch-ins and prevents Garganacl from being passive while also punishing Defog attempts from Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and Choice Scarf Yveltal, none of which meaningfully hurt Garganacl.</li> <li>Protect allows Garganacl to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Marshadow, Rayquaza, and Lunala. Additionally, it provides Garganacl with some minor healing and can accrue Salt Cure chip.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Garganacl to survive Life Orb Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock and avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Tera Flying Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent. Additionally, it enables Garganacl to survive +1 Zacian-C's Close Combat and defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades. 18 Speed IVs enable Garganacl to outspeed Calyrex-I under Trick Room.</li> <li>Tera Water enables Garganacl to wall defensive Primal Kyogre. Tera Water Garganacl shrugs off any attack from it, and Salt Cure chip prevents Primal Kyogre from accumulating the boosts it needs to threaten Garganacl. Because Tera Water Garganacl also survives wallbreaker Primal Kyogre's Thunder after Stealth Rock, it can use Salt Cure to leave Primal Kyogre easily revenge killed or otherwise force it out. Additionally, Tera Water enables Garganacl to safely stall out defensive Primal Groudon and Zacian-C with Protect and Salt Cure in a pinch.</li> <li>Tera Fairy Garganacl completely shuts down every Defogger. Although Garganacl isn't bothered by Giratina-O's Draco Meteor, preserving Recover PP is great for longer games. Tera Fairy also provides Garganacl with the unique trait of resisting Marshadow's STAB combination, which is highly valued by bulky teams worried about Choice Band Marshadow. Tera Fairy Garganacl can still survive an attack from wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, but has a harder time with defensive Primal Kyogre as it is 2HKOed by +1 Scald.</li> <li>Garganacl has a presence in every stage of most games. Early-game, it will often set Stealth Rock while punishing switch-ins with Salt Cure. Garganacl is content to repeat the process mid-game, and it can act as a win condition end-game using Protect and Recover to allow Salt Cure chip to accumulate.</li> <li>Garganacl partners well with Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Eternatus to create a hazard stacking core where Salt Cure can prevent Pokemon such as Alomomola and Taunt Arceus formes, which can usually hinder hazard setters playing a similar role, from taking advantage of Garganacl. Forgoing a Defogger and relying on the pressure from entry hazards to pressure opponents to Defog is valid, but Ho-Oh nevertheless makes a good partner thanks to its consistency and defensive prowess, while Choice Scarf Yveltal partners well due to its ability to position with U-turn, revenge kill Pokemon such as Marshadow and Zacian-C, and consistently Defog at least once per game.</li> <li>Garganacl often appreciates a teammate that can apply a direct source of offensive pressure to act as a win condition such as a Calm Mind Arceus forme or Zygarde. Although these Pokemon are self sufficient, their offensive presence is accentuated by Salt Cure chip. They appreciate Garganacl helping against Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre while Garganacl appreciates the help against Primal Groudon and Eternatus. Ditto also fills this role due to its ability to revenge kill most Pokemon on hyper offense teams that threaten to overwhelm Garganacl. Additionally, most Pokemon appreciate Garganacl's ability to act as a status sponge against defensive threats such as Ho-Oh and Eternatus.</li> </ul>"

With it, Glimmora can outspeed opposing Glimmora and Mega Diancie and potentially finish them off with Mortal Spin to prevent any hazards from staying on its side of the field, but this limits its ability to set entry hazards out of a lack of move slots.</li> <li>The given EV spread avoids a OHKO after Stealth Rock from Arceus-Ghost's Shadow Force, Choice Band Tera Flying Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent, and +1 Zacian-C's Close Combat while also outspeeding fully invested neutral natured base 90 Speed foes such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, granting better odds to set entry hazards. It's to be noted that this spread can't outspeed Zacian-C after a Speed drop from Mud Shot. An alternate spread of 40 Def / 244 SpA / 224 Spe fixes this while retaining the Rayquaza and Zacian-C benchmarks and the ability to OHKO specially offensive Yveltal with Power Gem after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Tera Steel prevents opposing Glimmora from removing entry hazards with Mortal Spin; Glimmora, however, shouldn't usually Terastallize, as other Pokemon it's partnered with generally make better use of Terastallizing.</li> <li>If the opposing team has a Poison-type like Glimmora or Eternatus, setting Toxic Spikes shouldn't be a priority, as they will get quickly removed as soon they enter the field, thus making it desirable to focus on setting Stealth Rock or Spikes. Similarly, as Glimmora can remove Toxic Spikes by switching in as long it survives entry hazards, it can still become useful mid-game after getting worn down in such matchups.</li> <li>Against Trick Room teams, Glimmora should be kept mid-game, as it can't set hazards on their usual lead in Hatterene due to its Magic Bounce ability, especially as Toxic Spikes hinder the longevity of such teams, and can prove useful to stall out Trick Room turns by being sacked.</li> <li>Against stall teams, setting Toxic Spikes and using Mortal Spin should be priorities to hinder the longevity of such teams, especially as Glimmora can do this multiple times across the match out of not taking damage as quickly as in other matchups.</li> <li>Wallbreakers such as Zacian-C, Double Dance Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM appreciate the entry hazards set by Glimmora to ensure more KOs, they also act as counterplay to Eternatus to limit its capability to come in to remove Toxic Spikes with offensive pressure.</li> </ul>"

      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Thanks to its setup-stopping ability in Unaware and excellent physical bulk, Dondozo is an excellent physical wall for stall teams that stops threats such as Zygarde, physical Arceus-Ground, and Zacian-C in their tracks.</li> <li>Avalanche takes advantage of Dondozo’s low Speed and allows it to hit Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Arceus Ground, Rayquaza, and Ultra Necrozma super effectively while allowing it to hit Primal Groudon neutrally. Its ability to OHKO Rayquaza is invaluable, as Choice Band sets greatly threaten stall teams.</li> <li>Body Press takes advantage of Curse boosts and hits Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C neutrally. Sleep Talk can be used to reduce passivity after using Rest, but it is usually unnecessary with Aromatherapy support from Chansey. *Leftovers is another option to provide passive recovery. As stall teams run double Defog support, entry hazard damage is less of a concern. Ability Shield allows Dondozo to wall Ultra Necrozma without running Tera Dark, since it prevents Unaware from being bypassed by Photon Geyser.</li> <li>Tera Fairy allows Dondozo to wall Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, Focus Blast Mega Mewtwo Y more efficiently, and counter Dragon Dance Zygarde. Tera Dark allows Dondozo to wall Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma by blocking Photon Geyser, which would otherwise bypass Unaware. This is unnecessary if Dondozo holds Ability Shield as its item.</li> <li>Dondozo must constantly conserve its HP early-game in order to check threats such as Zacian-C, Arceus-Ground, and Mega Salamence until they are worn down. Dondozo is able to check Rayquaza and Mega Salamence with Avalanche, although it cannot directly switch into Rayquaza, as Choice Band Tera Flying Dragon Ascent 2HKOes it. Once special threats such as Primal Kyogre, Yveltal, and Calm Mind Arceus formes have been removed, Dondozo makes for an excellent win condition thanks to Curse and Unaware.</li> <li>Dondozo is best used to stifle setup sweepers that have weaker initial power such as Zygarde and Arceus by using Curse. While Dondozo certainly can switch into attacks from threats such as Zacian-C, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Ground, it must be aware of its HP, or else it will not be able to check these threats late-game.</li> <li>On its own, Dondozo can be overwhelmed by the wide amount of physical threats in the tier such as Zacian-C, Ultra Necrozma, and Primal Groudon. Therefore, teammates such as Arceus-Dark and Giratina are helpful. Arceus-Dark is able to punish Tera Ghost Arceus that try to avoid Body Press; Ultra Necrozma, thanks to its immunity to Photon Geyser; and Zekrom, which overwhelms Dondozo due to Teravolt. In addition, Arceus-Dark is useful against Taunt Arceus Ground, which can slowly wear Dondozo down. Giratina can scout Primal Groudon sets, preventing Dondozo from being sniped by Overheat or Eruption. It also wastes Rayquaza’s Dragon Ascent PP thanks to Pressure, allowing Dondozo to more easily deal with Rayquaza late-game.</li> <li>Dondozo is easily beat by special threats such as Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Fairy, and Eternatus. Chansey, Eternatus, and Ho-Oh make excellent teammates, as they check these threats well.</li> <li>Dondozo appreciates Aromatherapy support from Chansey to remove sleep after using Rest. Leftovers Dondozo can be more easily pressured while entry hazards are on the field, so Defog support from Giratina and Ho-Oh is appreciated. In addition, Ho-Oh checks Primal Groudon sets that would beat Dondozo, while Giratina provides Toxic support, allowing Dondozo to beat threats such as Primal Groudon and Arceus faster.</li> </ul>"

While Icicle Crash is less accurate, it's an alternative that hits slightly harder, always OHKOes defensive Eternatus and 2HKOes defensive Ho-Oh, and avoids making contact with Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Ice Shard and Sucker Punch can be run at the same time to minimize mind games when revenge killing setup sweepers, with the former OHKOing Mega Salamence and Rayquaza and the latter OHKOing Mewtwo and Ultra Necrozma. Sacred Sword ensures a 2HKO on Arceus-Dark and Zacian-C.</li> <li>The given EV spread outspeeds Eternatus and avoids an OHKO from offensive Calm Mind Arceus-Water's Judgment and Silk Scarf Tera Normal Arceus's Extreme Speed, with the rest going to Attack to maximize damage output.</li> <li>Tera Dark removes Chien-Pao's weakness to Stealth Rock; prevents physical Ultra Necrozma at +1 from OHKOing with any attack but the uncommon Outrage; and lets Crunch OHKO wallbreaker Primal Kyogre, defensive Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock, and Rayquaza, as well as letting Sucker Punch OHKO Marshadow and offensive Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock. Tera Ice is an alternative to 2HKO defensive Arceus-Fairy and OHKO defensive Arceus-Ground with either Ice Spinner or Icicle Crash, as well as OHKO Ultra Necrozma with Ice Shard after a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>It's not recommended to immediately try to OHKO Zygarde with an Ice-type STAB move, as it will often Terastallize and flip its matchup against Chien-Pao. Unless another Pokemon on the opposing team has already Terastallized, it's best to try to bait it into Terastallizing by positioning Chien-Pao as if it could just attack Zygarde, then hard switch to a more defensive check such as Arceus-Fairy or Alomomola.</li> <li>Chien-Pao's typing has the minimal defensive utility of resisting Marshadow's Shadow Sneak and Yveltal's Sucker Punch; therefore, it's desirable to preserve its health so it can revenge kill them.</li> <li>As Chien-Pao is setup fodder for Zacian-C, dedicated checks such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM are solid allies, with Chien-Pao in exchange acting as an offensive check to foes such as Arceus-Ground, Rayquaza, and Marshadow.</li> <li>Chien-Pao struggles to come into the field, as it has minimal defensive utility, so defensive pivots such as Alomomola, Landorus-T, and Yveltal can provide the momentum that Chien-Pao requires to switch in safely and minimize the risk of being KOed on the switch.</li> <li>Chien-Pao is weak to Stealth Rock and can have longevity issues because of this; therefore, Defoggers such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O are formidable partners that can remove entry hazards for it, with Yveltal in particular also compressing pivoting and solidifying the matchup against Ultra Necrozma.</li> </ul>"

However, Chi-Yu's mediocre Speed tier means it is easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Marshadow and Palkia-O, especially since it is quite frail, meaning it needs team support to position itself safely, so Sticky Web structures are needed for it to thrive.</li> <li>Fire Blast allows Chi-Yu to OHKO offensive Necrozma-DM and 2HKO Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground unboosted while also OHKOing Extreme Killer Arceus after a Nasty Plot boost. Flamethrower has less power but improved accuracy.</li> <li>Black Hole Eclipse enables Chi-Yu to OHKO Double Dance Primal Groudon, Palkia-O, and Mega Salamence unboosted while also allowing Chi-Yu to OHKO Ho-Oh, defensive Primal Kyogre, Zacian-C, and defensive Eternatus after a boost, greatly benefitting it in wallbreaking opposing balance teams.</li> <li>Taunt allows Chi-Yu to stop status conditions such as Toxic poison and paralysis from Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, letting it wallbreak more comfortably. Overheat lets Chi-Yu break through Chansey after hitting it with boosted Black Hole Eclipse, as well as giving Chi-Yu a greater offensive presence outside of Nasty Plot, letting it OHKO Marshadow and defensive Necrozma-DM after a layer of spikes, although the latter is not guaranteed.</li> <li>A Timid nature is typically preferred to always outspeed unboosted Yveltal, support Arceus formes, Rayquaza, and Lunala, but Modest can be used for the extra damage, letting Chi-Yu more reliably OHKO Zygarde and Arceus-Fairy with boosted Dark Pulse and Fire Blast, respectively. Modest is significantly worse against more offensive team structures; however, as if Sticky Web support is removed Chi-Yu can no longer outspeed support Arceus formes and Lunala.</li> <li>Chi-Yu is a very strong attacker, so a lot of the time its presence alone can threaten out Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, enabling either free damage or a Nasty Plot boost. Chi-Yu should be careful with its Z-Move, since it's ideally used to target Pokemon such as Ho-Oh or defensive Eternatus, rather than using it wastefully against Pokemon such as Marshadow or Mega Mewtwo Y. In a situation where Chi-Yu cannot use Nasty Plot reliably, using Black Hole Eclipse unboosted is still quite powerful, as the chip damage alone is enough in some situations where a teammate can clean up walls like Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Chi-Yu works best on hyper offense structures that revolve around Sticky Web, meaning setters such as Shuckle and Smeargle are greatly appreciated; the latter also comes with the benefit of removing entry hazards with Mortal Spin for Chi-Yu, since it cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, while they both can set additional hazards such as Stealth Rock or Spikes which help Chi-Yu reach important damage thresholds.</li> <li>Teammates that can threaten out specially defensive walls such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Arceus-Fairy are greatly appreciated by Chi-Yu since it can wallbreak easier, so teammates such as offensive Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow are good for this; these Pokemon also appreciate Chi-Yu breaking through physical walls like opposing Primal Groudon, Zygarde, and support Arceus formes.</li> </ul>"
