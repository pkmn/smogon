  "Weezing": {
    "overview": "<p>Weezing differentiates itself from other defensive Poison-types such as Garbodor and Golbat due to its access to Levitate, which lets it check Ground-types such as Steelix and Rhydon without a weakness to Spikes. Additionally, Weezing's Poison typing allows it to check both Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Passimian, Decidueye, and Sceptile. Weezing's access to the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt lets it be effective against more defensive teams. Unfortunately, Weezing faces competition for the spot of a bulky Poison-type from Pokemon like Garbodor and Golbat, which have better Special Defense stats, allowing them to better check specially offensive Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Sceptile, as well as having reliable recovery in Golbat's case.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Z-Move sets can surprise traditional switch-ins like Xatu and Assault Vest Slowking with their increased damage output and retain some defensive value. Flamethrower is helpful to immediately deal with Steel-types like Steelix, Silvally-Steel, and Ferroseed. Haze can be used to clear stat boosts from Pokemon like Comfey and Klinklang, although Weezing struggles to justify it over other utility moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Weezing's low Special Defense, even resisted hits from Pokemon like Sceptile and Whimsicott do solid damage to Weezing, while Pokemon such as Alolan Exeggutor, Heliolisk, and Guzzlord threaten Weezing with strong neutral STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-type Pokemon such as Medicham, Sigilyph, and Slowking threaten to OHKO Weezing with their Psychic-type STAB moves, though Medicham must be cautious of Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, Xatu can deflect back Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon like Rotom and Mismagius come in easily on Weezing, fearing only being poisoned from Sludge Bomb, and they threaten Weezing with strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Residual damage from Stealth Rock and chip damage from Pokemon like Passimian and Decidueye make it hard for Weezing to continuously check the Pokemon it wants to because of its lack of recovery outside of Pain Split or Black Sludge.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is Weezing's STAB attack of choice, letting it deal damage to Pokemon immune to Will-O-Wisp such as Incineroar while also possessing a 30% chance to poison foes. Will-O-Wisp lets Weezing burn physical attackers such as Klinklang and Dhelmise. Pain Split provides Weezing with a source of recovery outside of Black Sludge, should Weezing opt for it, while also chipping away at Pokemon with more health than Weezing when Pain Split is used. Toxic Spikes lets Weezing cripple defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Vaporeon. Alternatively, Taunt prevents entry hazard setters like Steelix and Rhydon from doing their job.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The defensive investment lets Weezing avoid the OHKO from Incineroar's +2 Flare Blitz and the 2HKO from Choice Band Sneasel's Icicle Crash, both after Stealth Rock. The Special Defense investment prevents Weezing from being KOed by Life Orb Sceptile's +0 Leaf Storm into -2 Leaf Storm. If running Taunt, 44 EVs should be taken out of Defense and placed into Speed so that Weezing can outspeed and Taunt Vaporeon, preventing it from using utility moves like Wish. A more specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 16 Def / 196 SpD / 44 Spe with a Bold nature lets Weezing better check specially offensive Grass-types like Sceptile while still retaining the necessary physical bulk to check Pokemon like Passimian and Dhelmise. Rocky Helmet lets Weezing punish Pokemon such as Passimian and Whimsicott when they use U-turn and chips away at other physical attackers such as Steelix and Decidueye whenever they use a contact move. Alternatively, Black Sludge provides Weezing with a source of recovery if not using Pain Split. Levitate is Weezing's only ability and allows it to switch into Ground-type moves from Pokemon such as Steelix and Torterra.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of Weezing's high Defense and Poison typing, it can be switched directly into Fighting-type Pokemon such as Passimian and Scrafty to check them. Look to use Will-O-Wisp to burn threatening physical attackers such as Decidueye and Sneasel and to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon. Be wary of letting Weezing take too much damage from special attackers such as Whimsicott and Sceptile, as Weezing's low Special Defense does not allow it to check them easily, even with investment. Additionally, Sceptile and Whimsicott can carry coverage moves such as Psychic and Hidden Power Psychic to hit Weezing for super effective damage. Weezing should use Pain Split when low on health and when it can force the opposing Pokemon out, such as when against Passimian, Steelix, and Piloswine, as this maximizes the healing Pain Split will provide. Weezing should aim to set Toxic Spikes as early as possible if the opponent has no grounded Poison-types to absorb them. Taunt should be used both to prevent setup sweepers like Decidueye from setting up and to prevent utility-based Pokemon like Mega Audino and Vaporeon from using moves like Wish and Heal Bell.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weezing fits best on defensively oriented teams as an additional check to physical attackers. Pokemon such as Incineroar, Sneasel, and Steelix appreciate Weezing's ability to pivot into Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Passimian and Piloswine. Additionally, Incineroar and Sneasel check Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius, which threaten Weezing out. Because of Weezing's lack of recovery outside of Pain Split or Black Sludge, Wish users like Mega Audino and Vaporeon make excellent partners that can also provide cleric support with Heal Bell. Additionally, Weezing possesses good defensive synergy with Mega Audino and Vaporeon, handling the Poison-types that threaten Mega Audino and checking the Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Vaporeon. Even with Special Defense investment, Weezing's low special bulk leaves it vulnerable to strong special attackers such as Heliolisk and Houndoom. Therefore, Pokemon such as Slowking, Cryogonal, and Torterra provide switch-ins to strong special attacks, and Cryogonal also appreciates Weezing's ability to pivot into Fighting-type moves. Psychic-resistant Pokemon such as Slowking, Xatu, and Silvally-Steel cover Weezing's weakness to Psychic-type attacks; Xatu and Silvally-Steel also provide entry hazard control in the form of Magic Bounce and Defog, preventing Weezing from getting weakened by Stealth Rock. Additionally, Pursuit users such as Sneasel and Houndoom can trap Psychic-type Pokemon like Slowking and Sigilyph. If using Toxic Spikes, Pokemon that appreciate Toxic Spikes support such as Passimian and Medicham make great partners for Weezing.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great STAB combination, great coverage options, and access to Swords Dance, Gallade differentiates itself from other Fighting-type wallbreakers by being able to beat many traditional checks to Fighting-types like Slowking, Weezing, and Dhelmise with its Psychic-type moves and Knock Off. It also has usable special bulk, giving it setup opportunities against Pokemon like Blastoise and defensive Decidueye. However, Gallade is outsped by many threats like Vivillon and Rotom because of its average Speed, and it cannot take even resisted physical hits like Passimian's Close Combat safely due to its lackluster bulk. Additionally, a Psychic / Fighting typing is quite bad defensively, making Gallade neutral to Dark while still having the same weaknesses as other Fighting-types. Being neutral to Dark also makes Gallade unable to switch into Dark-type attacks safely to utilize its ability Justified. Aside from this, other Fighting-types give it competition by providing better utility for the team, like U-turn from Passimian and priority from Pangoro. Scrafty also has higher overall bulk and better abilities in Shed Skin, which allows it to set up without fear of status, and Moxie, which allows it to snowball and sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Punch with Electrium Z can be used, as Thunder Punch provides decent neutral coverage alongside Gallade's STAB moves, hitting Pokemon like Xatu, Sigilyph, and Slowking, although it worsens Gallade's matchup against Palossand and Dhelmise. Choice Scarf may seem appealing to Gallade, allowing it to KO most fast targets with its powerful attacks and support sweepers like Incineroar, Vivillon, and Mismagius via Memento support, but it forces Gallade to KO itself. It also faces fierce competition from Passimian, the most common Choice Scarf user in the tier, which is slightly bulkier and has access to U-turn, and Medicham, which is much stronger than Gallade thanks to Pure Power. Z-Hypnosis is also an interesting option, which enables Gallade to circumvent its average Speed while still being able to switch moves. However, Gallade will have to give up a coverage option or Swords Dance, which reduces Gallade's wallbreaking abilities and makes it generally an undesirable option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Slowking, Xatu, and Delphox all resist Gallade's STAB combination, although none of them enjoy taking a super effective Knock Off. Slowking and Xatu can stomach one unboosted Knock Off from full health, while Delphox can revenge kill Gallade, although it requires Gallade to be at around 50% health to do so.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Although most of them are pressured by Gallade's powerful moves, Rotom and Mismagius can revenge kill it with Shadow Ball. Palossand is hugely pressured by Gallade's Z-Moves and the threat of Knock Off, but it can stomach any move at +2 and use Shadow Ball on Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Comfey and Whimsicott will usually force Gallade out, as they always outspeed Gallade, are able to deal huge damage with their STAB moves, and can survive any hit from unboosted Gallade, although Comfey fails to properly take on +2 Gallade one-on-one without prior damage or Special Defense drops from Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Aerodactyl, Sigilyph, and Vivillon cannot directly switch in, as they take a lot of damage from Gallade's attacks but can all outspeed and OHKO it with their powerful Flying-type STAB moves. Vivillon can also outspeed Gallade and use Sleep Powder on it, giving it a free opportunity to set up Quiver Dance.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: There are many Pokemon that outspeed Gallade aside from the aforementioned Fairy- and Flying-types, such as Heliolisk, Sneasel, and Delphox. While none of them can OHKO Gallade without prior damage or Close Combat defense drops, they can all take a large chunk of its health away.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Gallade to break through defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Palossand more easily. Close Combat is Gallade's strongest STAB move, doing a good chunk of damage to non-resistant Pokemon like Blastoise and Druddigon. Psycho Cut nails Poison-types like Weezing and Garbodor and is chosen over Zen Headbutt because it has better accuracy and does not make contact, meaning Rocky Helmet and Aftermath will not be activated. Knock Off complements Gallade's STAB moves and hits Psychic-types for a decent amount of damage. Shadow Sneak can be used alongside Ghostium Z to provide similar coverage to Knock Off and helps Gallade pick off weakened checks like Rotom and Sigilyph. It also bypasses Colbur Berry, which is often held by Psychic- and Ghost-types. However, it has less power than Shattered Psyche.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature maximizes Gallade's offensive capabilities. Psychium Z gives Gallade a one-time nuke, breaking through Pokemon like Palossand and Dhelmise. Alternatively, Life Orb boosts all of Gallade's attacks without the opportunity cost of the Z-Crystal slot, but it allows Pokemon like Delphox and Sneasel to revenge kill Gallade more easily due to recoil and stat drops from Close Combat. Justified is only really useful against Passimian locked into Knock Off and if Gallade is holding a Z-Crystal, as most Dark-type attacks are able to severely damage Gallade or straight up KO it, although it is still Gallade's best ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spam Knock Off early-game to weaken the opposing team. Gallade's switch-ins all dislike taking a Knock Off; for example, Whimsicott is more threatening with Choice Specs, and Ghost-types may be unable to stop Gallade's sweep late-game if they have already lost their Colbur Berry. You should also note that Gallade is rather frail and does not have any useful resistances, so it is best to bring it in through VoltTurn users so it has enough health to wallbreak or set up a Swords Dance. Aside from that, Gallade should also avoid any status effects, as they compromise Gallade's ability to sweep and wear it down even quicker. Gallade does well against bulkier teams, as it has a Speed advantage, giving it more opportunities to set up Swords Dance and making it harder to revenge kill. Against offensive teams, however, Gallade should focus on spamming its attacks to soften up the opposing team for its teammates, as they struggle to take Gallade's hits safely even without any boosts. You can also use Gallade's Speed and type advantage to revenge kill Pokemon like Swords Dance Incineroar and Rhydon, although Gallade cannot come in on these threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon can check Flying-types for Gallade, while Weezing and Garbodor, as well as Steelix, can handle Fairy-types. All four can support Gallade in wallbreaking via entry hazard support. Fairy-types like Comfey and Whimsicott are also good partners; Comfey appreciates Gallade's ability to weaken or eliminate Steel- and Poison-types so it can sweep more easily late-game, while Whimsicott is able to U-turn out of Steel- and Poison-types and bring in Gallade. Dark-types can threaten Ghost-types for Gallade, allowing it to spam Close Combat more freely. Some of them like Swords Dance Incineroar can form a powerful wallbreaking core with Gallade. Pivots such as Heliolisk, Rotom, Choice Scarf Togedemaru, and Whimsicott are great for bringing in Gallade safely. One can opt for a Wish user like Vaporeon or Delphox to heal up Gallade and give it more wallbreaking opportunities. Additionally, Vaporeon can provide Heal Bell support, while Delphox can check Fairy-types and appreciates Gallade keeping Rock- and Dark-types in check offensively.</p>"

  "Vikavolt": {
    "overview": "<p>A Bug / Electric typing combined with the ability Levitate means that Vikavolt can come in against many NU staples such as Steelix and Passimian easily, as well as taking little from NU's Grass-type wallbreakers such as Sceptile. Furthermore, an extremely high base 145 Special Attack and Electric-, Bug-, and Grass-type coverage means that any team lacking a dedicated special wall will struggle to safely switch into Vikavolt. Despite only having base 43 Speed, Vikavolt is still fast enough to outspeed many of NU's walls, including some base 50s such as Hariyama as well as Vaporeon with Speed investment if needed. This low Speed also gives Vikavolt a slow Volt Switch, which can help to get teammates in without them taking damage. However, while its Bug / Electric typing is very unique defensively, it leaves Vikavolt with a weakness to Stealth Rock, so it is easily worn down from repeatedly using Volt Switch as well as easily hit for heavy damage from Rock- and Fire-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility can be used to let Vikavolt function as a potent cleaner against more offensive teams, but this means it is forced to give up either valuable recovery in Roost or coverage in Energy Ball, making it significantly worse off against other team archetypes. A physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 180 Def / 76 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to let Vikavolt function as a useful defensive wall, taking on enemy Passimian easily, but its weakness to Stealth Rock and significant loss of power hampers its function in this role. A set of Substitute / Roost / Thunderbolt / Bug Buzz with Metronome and an EV spread of 68 HP / 252 SpA / 188 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to give Vikavolt an incredibly strong matchup against stall with its power increasing after every consecutive hit, but this sacrifices any coverage to meaningfully damage enemy Rock-types such as Rhydon, as well as utility in Volt Switch, with the increased speed letting Vikavolt use Substitute to block Vaporeon's Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock heavily limits Vikavolt's bulk as well as its ability to pivot using Volt Switch, leaving it unable to safely switch into attacks such as Vaporeon's Scald.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Aerodactyl, Sigilyph, and Mega Glalie can easily force Vikavolt out, threatening to OHKO it or deal heavy damage to it as well as easily revenge killing it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Togedemaru, while uncommon, is one of Vikavolt's hardest answers, blocking Volt Switch while resisting Bug Buzz. Steelix cannot directly damage Vikavolt much, but it can use Toxic against it while being immune to Vikavolt's Electric-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Cryogonal, Mega Audino, and Silvally-Steel can generally take at least two hits from Vikavolt while threatening to status it with Toxic or wear it down in return.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Magmortar resist Vikavolt's Bug Buzz and threaten to easily OHKO it with Fire Blast. Delphox and Incineroar may not resist Bug Buzz, but both still threaten it with Flamethrower and Flare Blitz.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is Vikavolt's most powerful move, dealing good damage on neutral targets and having usable neutral coverage. This can also be boosted by Buginium Z to provide Vikavolt with an incredibly powerful Savage Spin-Out, even able to OHKO neutral targets such as Delphox. Volt Switch has reasonable power and lets Vikavolt bring its teammates in safely when used, as well as being Vikavolt's main Electric-type STAB move. Energy Ball hits most Pokemon for heavy damage, OHKOing Rhydon after Stealth Rock and being Vikavolt's most powerful move against Steelix. Roost is used to heal Vikavolt up, helping to mitigate damage taken from Stealth Rock and chip damage from enemy attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature maximize Vikavolt's wallbreaking power. The given Speed EVs let Vikavolt outrun maximum Speed Mega Abomasnow and anything slower than that. The remaining EVs are placed into HP in order to maximize Vikavolt's bulk, letting it take attacks such as Passimian's U-turn and Sceptile's Giga Drain with greater ease. Buginium Z is used to power up Vikavolt's Bug Buzz, giving it an incredibly powerful Z-Move able to hit almost all of NU for heavy damage, as well as to minimize damage taken from Knock Off. If not using a Z-Move, Leftovers can be used to reduce chip damage from Stealth Rock and give Vikavolt significantly increased longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vikavolt should use its resistances and typing to get in as often as possible, as its power means that if it is able to safely get in, for example, against Steelix or Seismitoad, it is often able to deal heavy damage to the enemy team. Aim to wallbreak with Vikavolt early-game to open up holes for a teammate to clean up late-game. Savage Spin-Out can be used to reduce the burden of prediction, as its sheer power means that most possible switch-ins will take significant damage from it. Alternatively, it should be used to break an important target, as its increased damage can help secure KOs against Pokemon such as Delphox and Cryogonal. Volt Switch can be used against faster foes to safely get in a Pokemon without having said Pokemon take any damage. Do not let Vikavolt get worn down too much, as being at high HP means that it has the opportunity to switch into and use Roost against targets such as Passimian and Steelix.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates with Volt Switch, Parting Shot, or U-turn such as Passimian and Silvally-Steel can help to force the opponent onto a bad foot, forever being in against the wrong Pokemon. Passimian is a notable partner, as Vikavolt can easily force out Slowking that try to come in against Passimian's U-turn. Entry hazard control can be provided by teammates such as Xatu, Silvally-Steel, and Dhelmise, as removing Stealth Rock means that Vikavolt can pivot significantly more often. Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Incineroar, Rhydon, and Blastoise make good teammates, taking on the Fire-types that threaten to KO Vikavolt. Pokemon that appreciate Steel-types such as Steelix and Silvally-Steel being weakened, such as Comfey and Klinklang, can make good partners, benefiting heavily from Vikavolt's wallbreaking.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is a very strong STAB move, dealing good damage on neutral targets and having usable neutral coverage. Its coverage hits many Electric-resistant Pokemon for heavy damage, 2HKOing specially defensive Druddigon while OHKOing Pokemon such as Alolan Exeggutor and Heliolisk. Thunderbolt offers good coverage when combined with Bug Buzz, 2HKOing Silvally-Steel and Audino while providing better neutral coverage than Bug Buzz once enemy Ground-types are eliminated. Volt Switch has reasonable power and lets Vikavolt bring its teammates in. It can also force the opponent into a losing situation, punishing them for switching out or staying in. Energy Ball hits most Electric-immune foes for heavy damage, 2HKOing Steelix and OHKOing other Ground-types such as Rhydon and Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature with Choice Specs maximize Vikavolt's wallbreaking power. 152 Speed EVs let Vikavolt outspeed maximum Speed Mega Abomasnow and anything slower than that. The remaining EVs are placed into HP in order to maximize Vikavolt's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is a very safe move to use early-game, as it has good neutral coverage with no types immune to it and hits almost anything that doesn't resist it for heavy damage. Energy Ball should be used if you predict your opponent to bring in a Ground-type to stop Volt Switch. If the opponent does not have a Ground-type, Volt Switch can be used to pivot with complete freedom, easily weaken the opposing team, and minimize chances for recovery. Vikavolt should be brought in against weak attacks such as Steelix's Heavy Slam or resisted hits such as Sceptile's Giga Drain. However, be wary of letting it get worn down too much, as its low Speed means it often has to take a hit before hitting the enemy back. Be careful when using Volt Switch or Thunderbolt, as this set has to predict when to use them in order to not lose momentum against enemy Ground-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Silvally-Steel and pivot Incineroar can be used to help get Vikavolt in safely, minimizing the damage it needs to take and letting it wallbreak freely. Stealth Rock prevention and removal from Pokemon such as Xatu, Silvally-Steel, and Rotom helps Vikavolt preserve its HP, letting it survive longer in a game. Stealth Rock support from teammates such as Rhydon and Piloswine can help wear down Pokemon such as Cryogonal, letting Vikavolt wallbreak more easily. Spikes support from Garbodor can also help to wear down Steelix and Silvally-Steel while Vikavolt switches into many of the Ground-types that trouble Garbodor. Switch-ins to Fire-types that threaten Vikavolt such as Vaporeon, Delphox, and Rhydon can make excellent partners. Cleaners such as Comfey and Passimian appreciate Vikavolt's wallbreaking, with Comfey appreciating enemy Steel-types being worn down.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Charizard is a decent setup sweeper with Z-Hold Hands that can clean a lot of weakened teams. Its good offensive typing and coverage can make it hard to stop defensively and allow it to circumvent some common Fire-type checks like Incineroar and Rhydon, and its good Speed and defensive typing allow it to outspeed most common Choice Scarf users besides Delphox and Heliolisk at +1 as well as tank common forms of priority such as Sneasel's Ice Shard and Comfey's Draining Kiss and set up against Pokemon like Sceptile and Steelix. However, due to its major Stealth Rock weakness, need to be the team's Z-Move user and to be paired with Pokemon that can wear down its checks, and failure to defensively check Pokemon that Fire-types should, such as Comfey and Mega Glalie, Charizard requires heavy support and cannot be fit onto teams easily. Because it can only set up once throughout the game and wants to preserve health, it tends to have a limited presence early-game and also faces competition from other setup sweepers like Vivillon and Comfey that can circumvent their checks better, require less of a commitment in teambuilding, and have a greater early-game-presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Z-Sunny Day set of Fire Blast, Sunny Day, Solar Beam, and Focus Blast with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs, a Timid nature, and Solar Power is a viable option, boosting Charizard's Speed, giving a sun boost to its Fire-type attacks as well as a Solar Power boost to all its attacks, and gaining the ability to have a one-turn Solar Beam that beats Rock- and Water-types like Rhydon and Slowking. However, this set is extremely prediction reliant and can be outplayed through stalling sun turns. A SubToxic set can be used to wear down Charizard's checks like Slowking and Regirock, but it is mainly outclassed by Delphox, and one of Charizard's biggest checks, Rhydon, can hit it through Substitute with Rock Blast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong> Due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Charizard struggles a lot more to set up and sweep, so keeping Stealth Rock off the field should be a priority.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon can tank Charizard's moves well and 2HKO it with Scald, and Assault Vest Slowking is an even more effective counter due to its better special bulk and ability to phaze Charizard with Dragon Tail. However, Blastoise and Seismitoad struggle to beat it due to their vulnerability to Air Slash and Hidden Power Grass, so Charizard at least can work against some Water-types.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock can easily tank a Hidden Power Grass, even at +1, and OHKO Charizard with its Rock-type STAB attack of choice. Aerodactyl can also easily take any move and OHKO back with Stone Edge, and while Rhydon is vulnerable to Hidden Power Grass, some spreads can take a +1 Hidden Power Grass from full HP and OHKO back with Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong> Pokemon like Mega Audino, Hariyama, and Delphox can avoid the 2HKO from any of Charizard's moves and wall it pretty well, although Hariyama is vulnerable to Air Slash and, before Mega Evolving, Audino is vulnerable to Focus Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Hold Hands": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>When used with Normalium Z, Hold Hands is used to give Charizard a boost in all stats, allowing it to act as a setup sweeper. Fire Blast is Charizard's primary STAB move and can break past Pokemon like Steelix and Dhelmise, as well as some neutral targets like Xatu and Rotom at +1. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for more accuracy, especially if Focus Blast is opted for over Air Slash, but the drop in power can be notable, missing out on some OHKOs like Xatu and maximum HP Rotom. Focus Blast is used to break past Miltank, Guzzlord, and Incineroar more easily, although it has issues with accuracy. Air Slash can be used over Focus Blast as a secondary STAB move to break past Fire-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar and Hariyama, as well as being a more accurate move to use against frail targets like Whimsicott with the additional bonus of causing flinches that can potentially allow Charizard to beat Pokemon that it would normally struggle with like Druddigon. Hidden Power Grass is used to beat Rhydon and Seismitoad and deal decent damage to Regirock, and it is also Charizard's best option to hit other Water-types like Slowking if using Focus Blast over Air Slash. Roost can be used to give Charizard more sustainability, allows it to use its defensive typing to be more potent and proactive early-game, and pairs nicely with Toxic Spikes; however, missing out on hitting Rock-types and Seismitoad means Hidden Power Grass is preferred. If Roost is used, Air Slash should always be chosen, as Charizard would be completely walled by Pokemon like Vaporeon and Slowking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z is used so that Charizard can use Z-Hold Hands. The investment into HP and Special Defense allows Charizard to take a Hydro Vortex from Slowking with the Z-Hold Hands boost, and the Speed investment and Timid nature allows Charizard to outspeed Houndoom and everything slower than it. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack for more power. Blaze is the preferred ability over Solar Power, as the extra power when in range of Blaze can secure KOs like Golbat after Stealth Rock damage and Palossand. Charizard needs to be shiny to use Hold Hands.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, Charizard's Z-Move is best preserved for late-game when its checks like Druddigon and Guzzlord have been sufficiently weakened to the point where Charizard can potentially pull off a sweep. Thus, early-game, it is usually better to just fire off attacks; however, if Roost is chosen, Charizard can play a lot more aggressively early-game due to its increased sustainability. Similarly, in a matchup where Charizard can potentially sweep, it is best to not recklessly switch it into opposing attacks, especially if Stealth Rock is up, as a weakened Charizard is a lot more vulnerable to priority and taking damage from a Pokemon it can't OHKO. However, as Charizard is a fairly good switch-in to Pokemon like Rapid Spin Dhelmise, it is sometimes OK to switch it in early-game. When setting up, scouting for moves that could potentially threaten Charizard like Roar and Toxic from Steelix and Stone Edge on Torterra is advised.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong entry hazard removers like Xatu, Rotom, and Blastoise are mandatory partners due to Charizard's vulnerability to Stealth Rock. With Charizard, two forms of removal are usually preferred because it's so imperative for Stealth Rock to be off the field. Grass-types like Whimsicott and Decidueye are good partners because they can take advantage of Charizard's Rock- and Water-type checks. Earthquake Sceptile is notable, as it can also lure in and KO some of Charizard's checks like Delphox. Dark-types, mainly Sneasel and Guzzlord, are good partners; Guzzlord can come in on Slowking, whereas Sneasel can Pursuit trap Slowking and remove Vaporeon's Leftovers with Knock Off. Charizard can form a Fire-type core with Pokemon like Magmortar and Incineroar, as they can help wear down each other's shared checks like Rhydon. Special wallbreakers like Alolan Exeggutor and Heliolisk can help chip down opposing Pokemon to put them in range of Charizard's attacks. Toxic Spikes users like Garbodor and Weezing also pair nicely with Roost Charizard because the hazard can allow Charizard to wear down and win against foes it otherwise has trouble with like non-Toxic Audino.</p>"

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Blastoise distinguishes itself as one of NU's most durable spinners, allowing its team to retain entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field even after removing hazards on its own side. Blastoise's access to Refresh allows it to switch into and mitigate Toxic damage from Steelix and Silvally-Steel without being worn down excessively itself. Its solid defensive stats and Water typing allow it to serve as a check to Fire-types such as Houndoom as well as Mega Glalie and switch into Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Piloswine. However, Blastoise's reliance on passive damage means that it is setup bait for sweepers such as Vivillon and Scrafty. Blastoise's lack of access to any recovery beyond Leftovers and Z-Refresh means it is often easy to wear down through switching into Stealth Rock multiple times and taking enemy attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blastoise has no viable other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Sceptile and Whimsicott generally take little damage from Scald and threaten Blastoise with super effective STAB attacks, making them generally good answers to it. Mega Abomasnow fears Scald burns if it's a Swords Dance variant, but mixed sets can easily take advantage of Blastoise's inability to threaten it and heavily damage Blastoise with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Seismitoad can set up Stealth Rock versus Blastoise and can potentially remove Toxic poison with Refresh. Heliolisk fears nothing from Blastoise beyond Toxic, as Dry Skin heals Heliolisk if hit with Scald, and it threatens Blastoise with super effective Electric-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Blastoise cannot use Rapid Spin against Ghost-types, nullifying its primary use on a team. Mismagius stands out, as it can use Taunt on Blastoise to prevent it from using Toxic and has the power to quickly wear Blastoise down, preventing it from spinning. Rotom can also hit Blastoise with super effective Electric-type attacks, quickly wearing it down.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: As Blastoise only has access to Leftovers and Z-Refresh for recovery, it can be quickly worn down by attackers such as Vikavolt and Guzzlord that can pressure it enough that it does not have a chance to spin.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald allows Blastoise to threaten Fire-types with super effective damage, hits the majority of NU Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and Steelix for super effective damage, and dissuades some foes from switching in due to its burn chance. Toxic allows Blastoise to wear down many of its switch-ins and is Blastoise's most effective way of wearing down bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Vaporeon. Rapid Spin allows Blastoise to keep its side of the field free from entry hazards while retaining hazards on the opponent's side, supporting teammates such as Magmortar. Refresh allows Blastoise to keep itself free of any status, allowing it to easily switch into Toxic from Pokemon such as Vaporeon. When coupled with Normalium Z, Blastoise can use Z-Refresh to fully heal itself once. Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-types such as Alolan Exeggutor and Sceptile, which would otherwise come in on Blastoise freely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs allow Blastoise to outspeed Jolly Incineroar. Maximum HP and 60 Defense EVs with a Bold nature increase Blastoise's physical bulk, letting it switch into Pokemon such as Rhydon, Mega Glalie, and Steelix more easily. Leftovers is Blastoise's main method of recovery, keeping it healthy throughout many switches into Stealth Rock. Normalium Z turns Refresh into a one-time 100% recovery move and minimizes Knock Off damage, allowing Blastoise to keep a form of recovery even after switching into Knock Off from foes such as Sneasel, albeit at the cost of more consistent recovery and the team's Z-Crystal.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Blastoise matches up well against most Stealth Rock setters, one should generally aim to bring it in on them, both to threaten them out and minimize Stealth Rock damage. The combination of Refresh and Toxic can help Blastoise to successfully badly poison Pokemon such as Vaporeon without worrying about being badly poisoned itself. Make sure that your team needs Rapid Spin support, as otherwise Blastoise is heavily outclassed by its competing Water-types such as Vaporeon, while Defog support can often be found elsewhere. If using Leftovers, make sure that Blastoise is not hit by Knock Off early-game, as that will leave it especially prone to being worn down very quickly by enemy attacks and hazards. Given its 30% burn chance and decent power, Scald is a very safe move to use, as it can often get a burn off against a foe even if they resist it and will often still deal good chip damage. If using Normalium Z, Blastoise is more able to switch into Knock Off users such as Sneasel, although it needs to time its usage of Z-Refresh carefully, as it has no other recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blastoise is somewhat unique in NU as a bulky Rapid Spinner and as such excels on teams that need entry hazard removal but want to use multiple hazards themselves. Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Garbodor both set up Spikes for Blastoise as well as switch into many of the Grass-types that threaten it. Pokemon that need hazard removal such as Sneasel, Scyther, Vivillon, and Incineroar greatly appreciate Blastoise's support, with many of them also serving as good switch-ins to Grass-types. Pokemon that can take on Grass-types, such as Golbat and Garbodor, help to cover up Blastoise's weakness to them, while Blastoise can often cover up defensive holes thanks to its stats and typing. As Blastoise is able to handle Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix, Pokemon that struggle with these such as Braviary and Incineroar can make great partners.</p>"

  "Clefairy": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefairy's niche largely comes from its great Eviolite-boosted special bulk, reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, and ability Magic Guard; these factors enable it to check the strongest special attackers NU has to offer while providing teams with a consistent switch-in to Toxic and Scald from defensive Water-types. Clefairy also has a wide pool of utility options at its disposal, including moves like Knock Off, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, letting it cripple the opposition for its team and prevent checks like Steelix from switching in without punishment. Unfortunately, Clefairy's passivity allows Pokemon such as Steelix, Garbodor, and Weezing in to set entry hazards. Furthermore, Clefairy is very vulnerable to Knock Off from Fighting- and Dark-types such as Passimian, Pangoro, and Absol, which makes it less reliable as a check to them.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismic Toss makes up for Clefairy's passivity by giving it a consistent source of damage against switch-ins like Steelix and Garbodor. Soft-Boiled lets Clefairy consistently switch into threats like Slowking, Rotom, and Sigilyph and recover health afterwards. Knock Off enables Clefairy to cripple remove items from Pokemon like Weezing, Vaporeon, and Golbat. Thunder Wave is helpful to slow down faster attackers like Aerodactyl and Sigilyph, although Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon like Rhydon, Rotom, and Dhelmise instead. Wish is also a good option so Clefairy can support teammates such as Steelix and Garbodor. Moonblast has a small niche as an option to hit Scrafty and Pangoro for heavy damage, although Clefairy will generally prefer the utility its other options provide it with.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP and Defense investment alongside an Eviolite lets Clefairy survive two Stone Edges from non-Choice Band Aerodactyl, while the remaining EVs go into Special Defense with a Calm nature so Clefairy can consistently check special attackers such as Heliolisk, Sigilyph, and Magmortar.

  "Golbat": {
    "overview": "<p>With its excellent bulk with Eviolite, great defensive typing, and reliable recovery, Golbat finds its place on teams that require checks to offensive Pokemon like Sceptile and Passimian. Additionally, the utility that Defog offers gives it a place on teams that require entry hazard control. Golbat possesses a great Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and deal with threats like Decidueye and Medicham. Utility options in Super Fang, Toxic, and Taunt offer Golbat a wide range of stallbreaking options against Pokemon like Vaporeon, Mega Audino, and Silvally-Steel. However, Golbat's weakness to Stealth Rock leaves it susceptible to being pressured and forced to Roost frequently, which also makes it less effective as a hazard remover. Golbat's heavy reliance on Eviolite leaves it vulnerable to being exploited by Pokemon it used to be able to check, like Sceptile and Fighting-types, when it has been hit by Knock Off. Golbat's passive nature leaves it prone to being pivoted on and taken advantage of by Pokemon like Steelix, Klinklang, and Rotom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse can be used to make Golbat a wincon, though this set generally falls short because it loses the utility of Defog. U-turn can be used to give the Golbat user momentum, but this lacks the overall utility of Defog and Taunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Rhydon and Aerodactyl take negligible damage from Brave Bird and put immense pressure on Golbat with their STAB moves and setup options. Steelix, Klinklang, and Silvally-Steel are immune to Toxic, take almost no damage from Brave Bird, and can take advantage of the switches they force against Golbat by setting up Curse or Gear Grind in the case of Steelix and Klinklang or by utilizing Parting Shot in the case of Silvally-Steel.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock inhibits Golbat's ability to reliably switch in and check Pokemon like Sceptile and remove hazards due to the 25% HP loss it suffers from every time it comes in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Heliolisk, Rotom, and Vikavolt can take advantage of Golbat's passive playstyle and use their strong Electric STAB moves to deal massive damage against it or employ Volt Switch to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Golbat is able to switch into Pokemon like Dhelmise and Passimian, though these Pokemon can remove Golbat's Eviolite with Knock Off and can hamper its defensive capabilities. Without Eviolite, Golbat cannot check Pokemon like Vivillon and the aforementioned Dhelmise as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Golbat's STAB move that hits Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon like Decidueye and Medicham for super effective damage. Toxic allows Golbat to deal with threats like Bulk Up Braviary and Comfey while consistently chipping away at Pokemon that are not immune to it. Thanks to Infiltrator, Golbat can bypass the Substitutes of the likes of Braviary and Vivillon and deal with them with Toxic and Brave Bird, respectively. Defog is Golbat's main form of utility, clearing entry hazards for its team and preventing unnecessary residual damage. Taunt inhibits the hazard setting capabilities of Pokemon like Steelix, Garbodor, and Druddigon while stopping Pokemon like Mega Audino and Vaporeon from using Wish and Heal Bell. Super Fang is an option to reliably break down Pokemon like Rhydon and Steelix on the switch, crippling the former due to its lack of recovery and dealing meaningful damage to the latter. Roost is Golbat's recovery move, providing longevity against Pokemon like Sceptile and Whimsicott. Poison Fang is an option over Toxic that allows Golbat to badly poison Xatu, which benefits Stealth Rock users like Steelix and Torterra that need help breaking it; however, Toxic is more useful against most teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Golbat to outspeed positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon like Medicham and Gallade as well as slower Pokemon like Decidueye and Samurott. 252 HP and 80 SpD EVs in conjunction with Eviolite give Golbat the ability to switch into the STAB moves of Pokemon like Sceptile and Whimsicott with ease while still reliably checking Pokemon like Passimian. Infiltrator allows Golbat to bypass Substitutes and deal with threats like Bulk Up Braviary with Toxic and Vivillon with Brave Bird.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golbat's bulk allows it to directly switch into the STAB moves of a plethora of attackers. For example, it can switch into Pokemon like Sceptile and Passimian and 2HKO if not OHKO these Pokemon with Brave Bird, and it can be used as a switch-in to Dhelmise, though it has to be wary of a Choice Band-boosted Anchor Shot. Golbat can also directly switch in against some Fairy-types like Comfey, but it cannot switch into Aromatisse's and Choice Specs Whimsicott's Psychic, as they both 2HKO Golbat, and it must be wary of Mega Audino's Knock Off. Try to avoid letting Golbat take an unnecessary Knock Off, as without Eviolite, it loses a lot of bulk and has a harder time functioning as a check to threats like Passimian and Scrafty. Stealth Rock is a large detriment to Golbat's ability to act as a defensive check, so make sure to use Golbat's ability to switch into the plethora of passive Pokemon in NU like Garbodor, Mega Audino, and Vaporeon as an opportunity to remove entry hazards with Defog. Utilize Taunt to stop Pokemon like Palossand, Torterra, Miltank, and Ferroseed from setting up hazards, and against Pokemon like Mega Audino and Vaporeon to stop them from using their utility moves. Utilize Toxic to cripple common switch-ins to Golbat like Rhydon and Heliolisk and against bulkier Pokemon that do not function well when badly poisoned, like Palossand and Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golbat is best used on stall and bulkier teams where a wide range of offensive threats that can threaten Golbat are covered. Psychic-types like defensive Delphox, Slowking, and Xatu can cover Golbat's Psychic-type weakness and, in the case of Xatu, assist with keeping Stealth Rock off the field. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Seismitoad, and Pyukumuku synergize well with Golbat defensively, as they are able to handle Pokemon that switch into Golbat like Steelix, Rhydon, and Klinklang, and in return, Golbat can beat the Grass-types that plague them. Ground-types like Palossand, Steelix, and Torterra make for great partners, as they are able to provide an Electric immunity and support the team with Stealth Rock. Clerics like Vaporeon, Articuno, and Mega Audino can remove debilitating status conditions like paralysis and burn with Heal Bell and help preserve Golbat's Roost PP and switch it in more safely with Wish.</p>"

In addition, Alolan Exeggutor can exploit defensive teams utilizing Pokemon such as Steelix, Vaporeon, and Torterra due to its decent bulk and Dragon / Grass typing, which grants it resistances to Ground-, Water-, and Grass-type moves. While unimpressive on its own, Alolan Exeggutor's Speed when fully invested is just enough to outspeed a myriad of slower Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Vikavolt, and Guzzlord, making it a massive threat to slower teams. However, Alolan Exeggutor is still incredibly slow overall, making it susceptible to revenge killers such as Passimian and Braviary. This in tandem with common weaknesses to Ice-, Fairy-, and Bug-type attacks makes Alolan Exeggutor vulnerable to the likes of Sneasel, Whimsicott, and Accelgor. Furthermore, despite having powerful moves, each individual attack is difficult to stay locked into; Draco Meteor and Leaf Storm's harsh Special Attack drop upon use is highly exploitable by setup sweepers such as Incineroar and Vivillon, whereas being locked into Flamethrower can allow threats such as Delphox to come in. Finally, Alolan Exeggutor has competition with Sceptile due to the latter's better Speed tier preventing it from being revenge killed as easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alolan Exeggutor is an effective user of Trick Room due to its horrendous Speed and ability to immediately apply offensive pressure. However, this set competes with other offensive Trick Room setters such as Slowking and Aromatisse due to their ability to set up with Nasty Plot, in addition to possessing higher bulk and better typings, allowing them to much more easily break through teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Alolan Exeggutor sports an unfortunate 4x weakness to Ice, making it susceptible to being OHKOed by the likes of Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Cryogonal. While they can't beat Alolan Exeggutor one-on-one, Pokemon such as Blastoise and Assault Vest Slowking may carry Ice Beam, dissuading Alolan Exeggutor from switching in directly. Mega Abomasnow's Ice Shard can be used to pick off Alolan Exeggutor with little difficulty.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Comfey possesses an immunity to Draco Meteor and takes little from Flamethrower, heavily pressuring Alolan Exeggutor no matter which move it locks itself into. Whimsicott boasts a resistance to both of Alolan Exeggutor's STAB attacks, though it doesn't like taking a Flamethrower or excess damage from Leaf Storm. Mega Audino, if kept healthy, is able to switch into any of Alolan Exeggutor's attacks and threatens to remove its Choice Specs with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Due to their immense special bulk, Pokemon such as Type: Null and Mega Audino can switch into Alolan Exeggutor's attacks and proceed to stall it out.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is an incredibly powerful STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that don't resist it hard, but its steep stat reduction upon use and inability to hit prevalent Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott make it difficult to spam repeatedly. Leaf Storm is Alolan Exeggutor's Grass-type STAB attack, being just as powerful as Draco Meteor, but it also lowers Alolan Exeggutor's Special Attack, which can allow setup sweepers such as Incineroar and Braviary to take advantage of it. Flamethrower rounds off Alolan Exeggutor's coverage, dealing super effective damage to Pokemon that resist its STAB moves such as Steel-types like Klinklang and Silvally-Steel as well as Whimsicott. Giga Drain is Alolan Exeggutor's most consistent form of damage output due to its lack of a downside, serving as a recovery option that's able to heal off a lot of damage against targets such as Vaporeon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment topped with a Modest nature enables Alolan Exeggutor to be as powerful of a wallbreaker as possible. With maximum Speed investment, Alolan Exeggutor is able to outpace Pokemon up to uninvested base 75s such as Garbodor and Vaporeon. Frisk is Choice Specs Alolan Exeggutor's only viable ability, providing use in scouting for foes' items. Choice Specs allows Alolan Exeggutor to become much more threatening of a wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring in Alolan Exeggutor whenever possible against defensive teams, as its wallbreaking capabilities are especially threatening to slower teams. Doing this frequently will enable Alolan Exeggutor's teammates to sweep much more easily. Pokemon such as Steelix, Torterra, and Palossand pose minimal threats to Alolan Exeggutor, and as such they can be used as a solid opportunity to fire off an attack. Rhydon and the aforementioned Steelix and Torterra are common Stealth Rock leads that can be easily exploited due to their poor Speed and weaknesses to Alolan Exeggutor's moves. Against offensive teams, switching in should be achieved by pivots, as this enables Alolan Exeggutor to gain the best matchup possible without taking excessive amounts of damage. Specific pivots such as Xatu and Passimian can be utilized to lure in Pokemon for Alolan Exeggutor to take advantage of such as Rhydon and Vaporeon. Alolan Exeggutor can also directly switch into bulky Water-types like Slowking and Pyukumuku, as they pose little threat to it as long as the former is not carrying Ice Beam. Because of its poor Speed, Alolan Exeggutor is highly dependent on prediction to maximize damage output. For instance, use Flamethrower if you feel that a Steel-type such as Klinklang or Silvally-Steel will attempt to take one of Alolan Exeggutor's other attacks. Be cautious of what Alolan Exeggutor locks itself into, as each of its moves can be exploited by certain Pokemon. Draco Meteor and Leaf Storm's stat reduction is often an invitation for setup sweepers such as Incineroar and Decidueye, as is Draco Meteor in general to Fairy-types such as Whimsicott and Comfey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Sneasel, Heliolisk, and Choice Scarf Passimian highly appreciate Alolan Exeggutor's ability to dent walls with its powerful STAB moves. Slow pivots such as Xatu and Incineroar ensure that Alolan Exeggutor is able to be brought in safely; both of these examples are notably able to lure in Pokemon such as Rhydon. Conversely, faster pivots such as Passimian and Braviary are able to lure in physically bulky Pokemon such as Steelix and Palossand. Alolan Exeggutor has solid offensive synergy with Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel-types like Incineroar, Medicham, and Klinklang due to their ability to take on various Ice-, Steel-, and Fairy-type threats to Alolan Exeggutor, and the weakening or removal of these threats allows Alolan Exeggutor to more freely spam its STAB moves. In return, Alolan Exeggutor can deal high damage to physically inclined walls such as Rhydon and Palossand. Entry hazard setters such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Garbodor are able to whittle at the opposition, which aids Alolan Exeggutor in wallbreaking. For instance, having Stealth Rock up ensures that Draco Meteor will always OHKO Golbat. Miltank and Piloswine are notable Stealth Rock setters, as they're able to switch into powerful Ice-type attacks for Alolan Exeggutor thanks to Thick Fat.</p>"

Furthermore, Hitmonlee only gets one chance to sweep, and if it loses its White Herb before it sets up, it is potentially dead weight, limiting it to being a late-game sweeper.

Whimsicott can stomach a boosted Stone Edge and OHKOes Hitmonlee in return with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Even if Hitmonlee does set up, it is easily handled by Ghost-types. Colbur Berry variants of Rotom, Dhelmise, and Palossand take little from Knock Off and proceed to cripple Hitmonlee with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, Dhelmise can potentially KO Hitmonlee with Power Whip even if it uses Curse once, and Palossand can even recover its HP with Shore Up. Mismagius outspeeds Hitmonlee before a boost, can shut it down with Taunt, and KOes it with Dazzling Gleam, but Mismagius needs to be wary of a boosted Hitmonlee.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: If Hitmonlee doesn't set up, its middling Speed and poor bulk allow it to be easily revenged killed by faster Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Whimsicott, Mismagius, Delphox, and Aerodactyl as well as Choice Scarf users like Passimian and potentially boosted Pokemon such as Klinklang and Scrafty.</p>",

      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse activates Hitmonlee's ability Unburden and makes it stronger and less susceptible to priority moves such as Sneasel's Ice Shard. Close Combat is Hitmonlee's most reliable STAB move and, thanks to the defense drops after use, allows Hitmonlee to gain the Unburden boost should it find itself in a situation where it cannot set up with Curse. Knock Off not only provides amazing utility for Hitmonlee's team, but it also allows Hitmonlee to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Xatu, Dhelmise, and Decidueye for super effective damage. Stone Edge allows Hitmonlee to hit Pokemon such as Golbat and Vikavolt for heavy damage. Earthquake is a fine option over Stone Edge to hit Garbodor and Delphox for more accurate super effective damage. However, this leaves Hitmonlee more susceptible to Whimsicott, Golbat, and Vikavolt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unburden doubles Hitmonlee's Speed after consuming its White Herb, allowing it to outpace every Pokemon in the metagame. White Herb restores the stat drops that come with using Curse, making it a reliable way to boost Hitmonlee's stats. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs in tandem with an Adamant nature allow Hitmonlee to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmonlee should be used as a wincon, so only bring it out late-game when its checks and counters are gone or weakened enough to the point where it can pick them off after it sets up. Avoid using Hitmonlee early- or mid-game; it only gets one chance to set up, and if it loses White Herb prematurely thanks to Close Combat, it won't get that chance again. Hitmonlee is very frail, so it cannot come in on most strong attacks. Despite this, Hitmonlee does force switches against Pokemon such as Incineroar, Absol, and Silvally-Steel, so use these opportunities to start setting up. Hitmonlee can use Curse twice to gain more power and bulk while still outspeeding Heliolisk, Sneasel, and Whimsicott. However, this leaves it outsped by Choice Scarf Passimian.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel and Houndoom make great teammates for Hitmonlee because they can trap and potentially get rid of the Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that give Hitmonlee problems. Special wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeggutor, Delphox, and Vikavolt can overwhelm physically defensive Pokemon such as Garbodor, defensive Slowking, and Palossand for Hitmonlee. Slow pivots such as Incineroar, Silvally-Steel, and Vikavolt can help bring Hitmonlee in on foes it can pressure such as Choice-locked Dark-type Pokemon. Incineroar and Silvally-Steel can also help Hitmonlee sponge hits from opposing Pokemon by using Intimidate or Parting Shot, making it easier for it to set up and sweep. Memento users like Whimsicott and Choice Scarf Gallade also help Hitmonlee take hits and can lure defensive Slowking and cripple it with Switcheroo or Trick. Pokemon like Seismitoad, Steelix, Rhydon, and Garbodor are good to pair with Hitmonlee because of their ability to set up entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes. Toxic users such as Vaporeon, and Garbodor help put bulky Pokemon that resist Close Combat like Palossand, defensive Slowking, and Dhelmise on a timer. Fire-types such as Electrium Z Magmortar and Grassium Z Delphox also make for good teammates because they lure Slowking in and deal with Comfey nicely.</p>"

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon excels as a Stealth Rock setter thanks to the combination of its solid Eviolite-complemented bulk and typing, as well as its great offensive presence, letting it pressure common forms of entry hazard prevention in Xatu, Dhelmise, Rotom, and Blastoise while serving as an effective stop to Pokemon like Incineroar and Braviary. Additionally, Rhydon's great Attack stat combined with Swords Dance and its passable Speed tier lets it function as a strong wallbreaker capable of dismantling walls like Vaporeon, Dhelmise, and Druddigon at +2. However, Rhydon's reliance on Eviolite for bulk makes it susceptible to Knock Off, and its resulting lack of recovery makes it easy to wear down. Additionally, Rhydon is vulnerable to the plethora of Water- and Grass-type Pokemon in the tier, as well as common coverage options such as Delphox's Grass Knot, Heliolisk's Surf, and Vivillon's Energy Ball, which harms its reliability as a standalone check to these Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rhydon can opt to run Groundium Z or Rockium Z to heavily damage common switch-ins, such as Slowking and Vaporeon, although forgoing Eviolite makes Rhydon a significantly worse check to Pokemon like Incineroar and Aerodactyl. Megahorn is an option that lets Rhydon more easily deal with Slowking while providing super effective coverage for certain Grass-types like Sceptile and Alolan Exeggutor. However, it forces Rhydon to drop Swords Dance, harming its ability to check Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary. Pursuit can be run to target Delphox and non-Colbur Berry Rotom, although Grass Knot is very commonly run on Delphox, while Rotom runs Will-O-Wisp often, making them difficult to successfully trap.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Dhelmise, Sceptile, Alolan Exeggutor, and Decidueye can easily switch into anything from Rhydon bar Ice Punch and OHKO it in return with their Grass-type STAB attacks. Dhelmise and Decidueye can also clear Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and Defog.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, defensive Slowking, and Blastoise can easily switch into anything from Rhydon and KO it with Scald. Samurott cannot switch in easily, although it can revenge kill Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although they struggle to switch in, Pangoro and Medicham can easily OHKO Rhydon with Hammer Arm and High Jump Kick, while Passimian can revenge kill Rhydon with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Heliolisk, Delphox, Magmortar, and Sigilyph cannot switch into Rhydon safely, but they all outspeed and can OHKO it with super effective coverage moves.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is mandatory for essentially any competitive team, and Rhydon is a great user of the move thanks to its ability to threaten common forms of entry hazard prevention, such as Xatu, Rotom, and Decidueye, with heavy damage. Earthquake hits other Stealth Rock setters in Steelix and opposing Rhydon and is Rhydon's best form of damage against neutral targets like Vaporeon, Slowking, Druddigon, and Blastoise. Stone Edge lets Rhydon always OHKO Xatu as it switches in and lets Rhydon take down Braviary and Golbat. Rock Blast is an alternative to Stone Edge that lets Rhydon better deal with Substitute Braviary and Focus Sash Vivillon, although Stone Edge's greater power is more appreciated. Swords Dance enables Rhydon to better take on Pokemon like Dhelmise and Bulk Up Braviary with its coverage options. Ice Punch can be run to let Rhydon lure in and take out Pokemon such as Alolan Exeggutor and Torterra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature bolster Rhydon's offensive capabilities and let it outspeed Pokemon such as Incineroar, Dhelmise, and Slowking. An Eviolite helps Rhydon better check Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Braviary. Rhydon can opt for a bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 52 Atk / 120 Def / 84 SpD with an Impish nature, which notably lets it survive two Close Combats from Passimian and lets it better take on Pokemon like Magmortar and Braviary. However, such a set is much more easily walled by bulky Pokemon like Dhelmise and Blastoise, even with the help of Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rhydon can gain opportunities to set Stealth Rock by switching into Pokemon it checks such as Incineroar, Braviary, and Garbodor. However, if the opponent has a Xatu, it is often worthwhile to predict it switching in by using Stone Edge or Rock Blast to dent it. From there, you can use Swords Dance to help ease Roost mind games. Similarly, predicting other forms of entry hazard control such as Dhelmise and Decidueye to switch in and using Ice Punch to hit them can open up the opportunity to keep Stealth Rock up. Once Stealth Rock is set, simply firing off attacks to take advantage of Rhydon's great Attack stat can open up holes in the opponent's team. While Rhydon is generally a solid check to Fire- and Flying-types like Incineroar and Braviary, be wary of super effective coverage options from them; Rhydon can be taken down by moves like Incineroar's boosted Tectonic Rage and Braviary's boosted All-Out Pummeling. Although Rhydon looks like a solid Heliolisk check due to its resistance or immunity to Heliolisk's STAB attacks, it must be extremely wary of Surf as well as Hyper Voice, which reliably 3HKOes it. Similarly, while Rhydon does a great job of checking Incineroar, be wary of switching into Knock Off, as losing Eviolite severely compromises Rhydon's bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types like Decidueye, Sceptile, and Dhelmise have great defensive synergy with Rhydon; they appreciate Rhydon switching into Flying- and Fire-type attacks for them, while they can take on opposing Water-, Ground-, and Grass-types. Similarly, Fire-types like Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar appreciate Rhydon drawing in Grass-types for them. Weezing and Garbodor can form an entry hazard stacking core with Rhydon and appreciate its effectiveness at pressuring Pokemon like Xatu, Rotom, and Golbat. In return, these Pokemon can switch into Fighting- and Grass-type attacks for Rhydon. Because Rhydon lacks any form of recovery, Wish support from Vaporeon and Delphox helps keep it healthy enough to switch into Pokemon like Incineroar and Rotom several times. Vaporeon can also provide Heal Bell support, which helps prevent Rhydon from being worn down by poison and burn from the likes of Weezing and Rotom.</p>"

Tauros is further hampered by its lacking defensive traits, which make it difficult to switch in and set up safely against almost anything other than Xatu, while other wallbreakers like Incineroar and Alolan Exeggutor find multiple chances to come into battle thanks to their typing and abilities.</p>",

However, Tauros finds few opportunities to set up and is unable to reliably break Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Rhydon even with Work Up and its coverage options. Other wallbreakers such as Incineroar, Heliolisk, and Whimsicott are generally better options thanks to their better ability to bypass checks of their own, stronger immediate firepower, and greater defensive utility that lets them find more opportunities to switch in compared to Tauros.</p>"}},

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its high all-around bulk and access to utility moves such as Wish, Toxic, and Heal Bell, Vaporeon is a premier defensive Water-type in the tier, checking prominent physical attackers such as Incineroar, Passimian, Sneasel, and Rhydon as well as special attackers such as Guzzlord, Houndoom, and Assault Vest Slowking. The combination of Wish + Protect lets Vaporeon both serve as an amazing support Pokemon, keeping Pokemon that don't have access to reliable recovery like Incineroar, Whimsicott, Dhelmise, and Silvally-Steel healthy, and maintain its own health. Because of its ability Water Absorb, Vaporeon is capable of handling opposing bulky Water-types like Blastoise and Slowking while also checking offensive Water-types like Samurott and Omastar. Unfortunately, although Vaporeon has a high HP stat, its physical bulk is lacking, making it easy for Pokemon like Medicham and Dhelmise to pressure it. Additionally, Vaporeon's passivity and reliance on Toxic for damage invite in threatening setup Pokemon like Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, Taunt + Calm Mind Comfey, and Bulk Up Scrafty that can circumvent Toxic in some way. While Vaporeon's special bulk is great, it can still struggle with common specially offensive Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon like Whimsicott, Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Rotom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vaporeon can use Celebrate in conjunction with Normalium Z to boost all of its stats with Z-Celebrate, turning it into an effective late-game sweeper. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature lets Vaporeon hit as hard as possible and be as fast as possible, notably outspeeding up to Sceptile after a Z-Celebrate. The coverage provided by the combination of Hydro Pump, Shadow Ball, and Ice Beam lets Vaporeon hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. However, Vaporeon isn't impressively fast even after setting up, being outsped by Choice Scarf users like Passimian, Braviary, and Rotom. Additionally, Vaporeon can only set up once with Z-Celebrate and wants to preserve its health for setting up, greatly limiting its early- and mid-game presence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Whimsicott and Sceptile can come in easily on Vaporeon's weak Scald and hit it with strong Grass-type moves. Decidueye and Dhelmise threaten Vaporeon out with a 2HKO and OHKO, respectively, although they must be wary of a burn from Scald. Torterra struggles to switch into Vaporeon because of the risk of a burn from Scald, but it threatens to OHKO Vaporeon with Bloom Doom.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Heliolisk is immune to Vaporeon's STAB attacks thanks to its ability Dry Skin, although it doesn't appreciate being badly poisoned by Toxic. Rotom can cripple Vaporeon with Trick or simply threaten solid damage with Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. Vikavolt can tank Vaporeon's weak Scald fairly well, pressure Vaporeon with its Electric-type moves, and recover health with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can set up on Vaporeon, as Scald will not break its Substitute. Guts Hariyama takes little from Scald, doesn't mind a burn, and threatens heavy damage with Close Combat. Life Orb Medicham overwhelms Vaporeon easily thanks to Pure Power, a strong Fighting-type STAB attack in High Jump Kick, and Electric-type coverage in Thunder Punch, although Medicham cannot safely switch into Vaporeon because of Scald's chance to burn and cannot freely use High Jump Kick, as Vaporeon can use Protect against it. Gallade can set up Swords Dance and threaten Vaporeon with a strong Close Combat or Leaf Blade, but it doesn't appreciate a burn from Scald at all.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Vaporeon is vulnerable to being Taunted by Pokemon like Comfey, Samurott, and Golbat, as it is heavily reliant on using Toxic to cripple foes and Wish to heal itself and teammates. Additionally, Comfey can set up with Calm Mind, fearing little from Vaporeon's Scald, while Samurott takes little from Scald, can use Taunt to prevent Vaporeon from recovering health with Wish, and can 3HKO Vaporeon with Grass Knot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Vaporeon's most spammable STAB move and possesses a 30% chance to burn the foe, letting Vaporeon dissuade physical attackers like Passimian, Decidueye, Braviary, and Dhelmise from switching in. Toxic allows Vaporeon to threaten bulky Water-types like Blastoise, Slowking, and opposing Vaporeon while also crippling Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Comfey. Alternatively, Heal Bell can be used to help prevent Vaporeon from being badly poisoned by Pokemon like defensive Slowking, Golbat, and defensive Hariyama and provide its team with cleric support. However, Vaporeon relies heavily on Toxic to damage opposing bulky Water-types, and the lack of Toxic makes Vaporeon even more passive. Wish gives Vaporeon a source of active recovery and supports Vaporeon's teammates well thanks to Vaporeon's high base HP stat, meaning Wish will restore more HP. Protect lets Vaporeon scout opposing Choice item Pokemon, recover free health with Leftovers and Wish, and rack up Toxic damage on opposing Pokemon. Additionally, Protect lets Vaporeon take boosted Z-Moves from the likes of Incineroar, Klinklang, and Houndoom, allowing it to survive their subsequent attacks and retaliate with Scald.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximize Vaporeon's physical bulk, letting it better handle physical attackers like Passimian, Hariyama, and Klinklang. Leftovers provides Vaporeon with passive recovery, and it can take advantage of this further with Protect. Water Absorb restores Vaporeon's health when it is hit by a Water-type move and gives it an immunity to Water, which aids it in checking Pokemon such as Slowking and Samurott.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vaporeon should look to spread status early-game through the use of Scald and Toxic to cripple the opposing team for its teammates and punish Pokemon such as Decidueye, Dhelmise, and Heliolisk for switching in in an attempt to gain momentum. Additionally, Vaporeon should always prioritize using Toxic if the opponent has a bulky Water-type like Slowking on the field, as badly poisoning it is much more valuable than burning it in order to cripple its longevity. Although Heal Bell variants of Vaporeon can remove status such as Toxic poison, non-Heal Bell Vaporeon must watch out for Toxic from Pokemon like Delphox and Steelix, as being badly poisoned greatly limits Vaporeon's longevity. Vaporeon can be switched into defensive Pokemon that cannot do much harm to it such as Rhydon and Palossand in order to gain momentum and have an easier time passing a Wish to a teammate. Be mindful of switching Vaporeon into Pokemon like Incineroar, Sneasel, and Passimian, as while Vaporeon can stomach hits from these Pokemon well, it risks losing its Leftovers to a Knock Off. Additionally, while Vaporeon is an effective check to physical attackers like the aforementioned Pokemon, its low physical bulk can lead to it being overwhelmed by stronger physical wallbreakers like Medicham and force it to use Wish simply to sustain itself rather than to support its team. If the opponent has a Pokemon that doesn't mind Toxic and Scald such as Blastoise, Refresh Seismitoad, or Ferroseed, it is very likely they will switch into Vaporeon. Therefore, switching into a Pokemon that can take advantage of such a play like Electrium Z Magmortar or Grassium Z Delphox is a good idea. Vaporeon should use Protect when it is up against a Choice item user like Alolan Exeggutor or Passimian to scout what move they are going to use, gain free passive recovery via Leftovers, and guarantee recovery from Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vaporeon fits best on balanced teams that appreciate its ability to provide Wish support and pivot into threatening wallbreakers like Incineroar and Guzzlord. Entry hazard support from the likes of Rhydon, Palossand, and Torterra synergizes well with Vaporeon chipping down foes with Toxic and repetitive uses of Scald. Grass-types like Whimsicott and Sceptile work well alongside Vaporeon, being able to take Electric- and Grass-type attacks while also appreciating Vaporeon's ability to punish bulky Water-types with Toxic. Decidueye and Dhelmise appreciate Vaporeon being able to switch into Incineroar and Sneasel. Whimsicott, Decidueye, and Dhelmise all appreciate receiving Wishes from Vaporeon, as it allows them to better use their resistances to Water and Fighting to pivot in. Incineroar is a great partner for Vaporeon, as Vaporeon handles both problematic Rock- and Ground-types like Aerodactyl and Rhydon and Fighting-types like Passimian and Hariyama. Furthermore, due to Incineroar's lack of sustainability outside of a potential Berry, it appreciates being able to receive large Wishes from Vaporeon. In return, Incineroar deals with Grass-types like Decidueye and Whimsicott for Vaporeon and can switch into Mega Glalie to scout for Freeze-Dry. Steel-types such as Steelix and Silvally-Steel appreciate Vaporeon checking Fire-types like Incineroar, non-Grassium Z Delphox, and Houndoom and providing Wish support. Additionally, Steelix and Silvally-Steel check Grass-type wallbreakers like Whimsicott and Dhelmise for Vaporeon.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>The combination of Aerodactyl's great Attack and Speed makes it a versatile offensive threat. It can function as a formidable wallbreaker, Pursuit trapper, and revenge killer capable of threatening other frail fast attackers such as Sceptile, Heliolisk, Delphox, and Sigilyph while threatening bulky Pokemon such as Blastoise and defensive Slowking with 2HKOs after Stealth Rock. While Aerodactyl is rather threatening offensively, its typing also provides it with benefits defensively, most notably letting it switch into and check Pokemon such as Incineroar, Braviary, and Vivillon and recover health with Roost. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl struggles to reliably break through common defensive Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon due to their resistance to Stone Edge and ability to take even Choice Band-boosted Earthquake with their great physical bulk. Additionally, Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness combined with its poor bulk limits its ability to switch into resisted hits from the likes of Magmortar and Vivillon. Similarly, Z-Move variants of Aerodactyl will be forced to spend turns using Roost so they remain healthy enough to check Pokemon such as Incineroar, causing them to give up momentum. Furthermore, Aerodactyl's poor bulk leaves it susceptible to revenge killing from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Passimian and Togedemaru as well as Sneasel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerodactyl can make use of Hone Claws and a Z-Crystal to have the strength of the Choice Band set without having to lock itself into a move, but the longevity Roost provides as well as lack of immediate power make this option less consistent. Aerodactyl can run a Stealth Rock set that provides good role compression with its ability to set entry hazards, switch into Pokemon such as Incineroar, and revenge kill Pokemon such as Delphox and Heliolisk, but other Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon and Steelix are preferred due to their greater bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground- and Rock-types</strong>: Steelix, Palossand, and Rhydon all have immense physical bulk, letting them easily switch into attacks from Aerodactyl and set Stealth Rock or attack it. Regirock doesn't resist Stone Edge but still takes it as well as Earthquake reasonably well and threatens Aerodactyl out with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Seismitoad, Vaporeon, and defensive Slowking switch into Aerodactyl reasonably well and threaten it out with super effective damage. However, they all run the risk of being 2HKOed after Stealth Rock by one of Aerodactyl's sets. Samurott cannot switch into Aerodactyl well, but it does threaten to OHKO Aerodactyl with its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers and Priority</strong>: Because Aerodactyl's bulk isn't great, it can be easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Togedemaru as well as priority moves from the likes of Sneasel, Pangoro, and Medicham.</p>",

Aerial Ace punishes Fighting-types like Passimian that try to pivot into Stone Edge as well as threatening Grass-types in Dhelmise, Sceptile, and Alolan Exeggutor. Earthquake rounds out Aerodactyl's coverage well, targeting Rock-resistant Pokemon like Steelix and Rhydon. Pursuit lets Aerodactyl capitalize on it forcing out frail, fast attackers such as Heliolisk and Sigilyph and trap them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature and Choice Band makes Aerodactyl as strong and fast as possible, 2HKOing even defensive Slowking after Stealth Rock while outspeeding Pokemon such as Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Calm Mind Delphox and at worst Speed tying with opposing Aerodactyl. Unnerve lets Aerodactyl Pursuit trap common Colbur Berry users such as Rotom and Decidueye more reliably and prevents pinch Berry users such as Incineroar from recovering health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Aerodactyl's typing provides it with useful resistances and immunities to common types in Fire and Ground, it's usually better to bring Aerodactyl in via pivoting and double switching due to its poor bulk and Stealth Rock weakness hampering its longevity. Due to the solid power of Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge, firing one off whenever Aerodactyl gets a free turn is usually a good idea. However, if the opponent has a sturdy Rock-resistant Pokemon like Rhydon or Steelix, using Earthquake to get chip damage on it is beneficial in the long run. Similarly, using Aerial Ace to nail Fighting-types like Passimian and Scrafty is ideal. Aerodactyl's great Speed lets it force out frail Pokemon like Delphox and Sigilyph; take advantage of this by Pursuit trapping them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Comfey makes a fantastic partner for Choice Band Aerodactyl; Aerodactyl threatens Fire-types such as Magmortar and Delphox, even threatening to Pursuit trap and remove the latter, and immensely pressures Weezing and Steelix for it. Other late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Passimian and Togedemaru also benefit from Aerodactyl heavily pressuring physical walls such as Slowking and Steelix. In return, Passimian and Togedemaru can bring Aerodactyl onto the field safely with U-turn. Due to Aerodactyl's susceptibility to getting worn down by Stealth Rock, entry hazard control is mandatory alongside it; Pokemon like Blastoise, Dhelmise, and Rotom make ideal partners for Aerodactyl due to this. In addition, Blastoise and Dhelmise can take Water-type attacks aimed at Aerodactyl, while Rotom can switch into faster Electric-types like Choice Scarf Heliolisk and Togedemaru while providing pivot support with Volt Switch. Since Aerodactyl is frail, pairing with sturdy walls such as Steelix and Weezing that can check common revenge killers in Passimian and Togedemaru is worthwhile. These options can also supply hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Knock Off support from the likes of Incineroar and Passimian is also nice to pair alongside Aerodactyl to remove Choice Scarf from Pokemon such as Passimian as well as Leftovers from bulky Water-types like Blastoise. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Garbodor pairs well with Aerodactyl, since it helps weaken Rock-resistant Pokemon like Steelix and Rhydon, and Aerodactyl's ability to force switches can make racking up Spikes damage fairly easy.</p>"

Earthquake leaves Aerodactyl less helpless against bulky Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon like Steelix, Rhydon, and Regirock. Roost helps Aerodactyl switch into attacks from the likes of Incineroar and Braviary more often and prevents it from being quickly worn down by Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment lets Aerodactyl always KO Blastoise with the combination of Supersonic Skystrike and Stone Edge after Stealth Rock, while 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature ensure Aerodactyl outspeeds Sceptile and everything slower while Speed tying at worst with opposing Aerodactyl. Unnerve prevents pinch Berry users such as Incineroar from pivoting into entry hazards on a predicted Roost to recover health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The key to this set is proper timing of Supersonic Skystrike; Aerodactyl heavily relies on it to break defensive Water-types such as Blastoise and Seismitoad, and because Aerodactyl generally draws in Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Togedemaru, using Earthquake to damage or remove them is good. Due to this set's increased defensive utility, finding opportunities to switch in and wallbreak isn't too difficult; Aerodactyl can switch into attacks such as Incineroar's Knock Off and Braviary's Brave Bird and recover health with Roost to remain healthy. Aerodactyl should generally be using Stone Edge to wallbreak, although it should take advantage of its solid coverage in Supersonic Skystrike and Earthquake to nail Rock-resistant targets such as Passimian and Steelix for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aerodactyl is a great fit on offensive and balance teams looking to make use of its defensive utility to better manage Pokemon such as Incineroar, Magmortar, and Vivillon. Since Aerodactyl is still rather frail, it appreciates having a sturdy defensive backbone to support it. Pokemon such as Druddigon and Slowking are helpful in taking Water-type attacks aimed at Aerodactyl, while Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Seismitoad can switch into Electric-type attacks. Druddigon and Seismitoad can also provide Stealth Rock support, while Dhelmise can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Fire-types such as Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar appreciate Aerodactyl's ability to weaken and remove opposing bulky Water-types for them. Similarly, Pokemon like Comfey and Whimsicott enjoy having opposing Fire-types removed. Although Aerodactyl has Roost to maintain longevity, it still appreciates having hazard control from Pokemon such as Blastoise and Rotom so it can spend its time on the field wallbreaking as opposed to recovering health. Since Choice Scarf Passimian greatly threatens Aerodactyl, Knock Off support from the likes of Incineroar is beneficial to pair alongside Aerodactyl. Aerodactyl struggles to break Steelix and Rhydon reliably; therefore, Spikes support from the likes of Garbodor makes it easier for Aerodactyl to do so. Additionally, because Aerodactyl is good at forcing switches, it can force the spreading of chip damage from Spikes.</p>"

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Typhlosion has access to Eruption, passable coverage, and a solid Speed tier, it falls short as a wallbreaker due to it failing to reliably break bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Slowking as well as other Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Hariyama and Druddigon. Additionally, Typhlosion faces immense competition as a Fire-type from Magmortar and Delphox. Magmortar is a better wallbreaker due to its greater Special Attack and coverage options, while Delphox is much more versatile, being able to employ multiple sets effectively. Do not ever use this Pokemon with the intent of winning games.</p>",
    "sets": {"Typhlosion": {"description": "<p>This set raises the power of Typhlosion's Eruption, making it difficult for any non-Fire-resistant Pokemon to switch into the move. Opting for Flash Fire for Typhlosion's ability provides it with more opportunities to switch in and can further boost Eruption's power, although Blaze is more consistent and prevents Typhlosion from being entirely inferior to its competition when it's low on health. However, Typhlosion typically struggles to reliably spam Eruption because of the prominence of Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Druddigon, Vaporeon, and Slowking. Magmortar and Delphox are more reliable as specially offensive Fire-types because of Magmortar's greater wallbreaking capabilities and Delphox's greater Speed and ability to boost its Special Attack.</p>"}},

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu is the embodiment of Magic Bounce; it is able to keep its team safe from entry hazards and take on the likes of Steelix, Ferroseed, and Miltank outstandingly. In a tier where several top-tier Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock, the role Xatu provides is extremely valuable, supporting Pokemon like Incineroar and Mega Glalie. Access to Roost, U-turn, and a bunch of utility options let Xatu excel at the pivoting role it's known for, and its typing stands out in giving it a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves. Another valuable trait is Xatu's solid matchup against stall teams, being able to bounce back status moves like Toxic to targets like Pyukumuku. That being said, hazard setters like Rhydon, Palossand, and Piloswine can threaten it out with their STAB moves, making it necessary to win mind games against them just to keep hazards away. Xatu is also prone to getting trapped by Sneasel and Houndoom, which could make it tough for Xatu's team to fight against hazards. Mold Breaker ignores Xatu's Magic Bounce, allowing Druddigon to set up Stealth Rock against teams that use Xatu as hazard control. Lastly, Xatu's bulk can be rather underwhelming, meaning players have to be very cautious to let it get worn down too fast. Likewise, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xatu can use Reflect and Light Screen alongside a Light Clay to support offensive partners like Weakness Policy Incineroar, Bulk Up Braviary, and Omastar on offensive archetypes. Offensive moves other than Night Shade are an option as well. Grass Knot takes on Slowking, Steelix, and Rhydon, the latter of which, Rhydon is especially important to beat as an entry hazard setter. Psychic deals reliable damage against most Pokemon that don't resist it. Most notably, it also lets Xatu hit Garbodor with a lot more strength and handles Fighting-types like Hariyama better. Dazzling Gleam hits Guzzlord and Scrafty while still being able to hit Sneasel. Offensive sets of Xatu are possible, but they give up a lot of the reliability in hazard control that defensive variants provide. Furthermore, Xatu will more often than not prefer the constant damage output from Night Shade over other offensive moves because of the consistent damage. Thunder Wave can catch incoming Sneasel and Braviary and just slow down fast Pokemon in general. Another option is Calm Mind + Stored Power, giving Xatu an excellent matchup against stall, but this gives up some of its ability to deal with more offensive playstyles. There are far better users of this move in the tier, and Xatu is usually better off using the aforementioned moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Select Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Several Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon, offensive Steelix, and Piloswine can scare away Xatu with super effective STAB moves, severely limiting its role and usefulness. Druddigon also sets Stealth Rock for free on Xatu lacking Defog, because of Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Sneasel and Houndoom can trap Xatu with Pursuit and let teammates set entry hazards without many worries. Xatu can try to avoid being Pursuit trapped with U-turn, but it should be careful of being outplayed and becoming unable to use Roost. That being said, it can still scout with Protect and take these foes down one-on-one if they are locked into Pursuit. Other Dark-types like Guzzlord and Incineroar, despite not outright trapping Xatu, can be a big threat to it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Heliolisk doesn’t take any damage from Night Shade and is only really scared of U-turn or Toxic. Other Electric-types like Rotom and Vikavolt are also notable despite getting by Night Shade. After coming in on Xatu, all three can safely force it out and grab momentum with Volt Switch or fire a strong STAB-boosted hit.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Mega Glalie and Cryogonal can switch in for free and force Xatu out, but none of them appreciate a Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: In a similar vein, Decidueye, Dhelmise, Haunter, and Mismagius can also force Xatu out and switch in for free. Haunter is also immune to Toxic.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Night Shade is Xatu's main form of damage, dealing consistent damage to pretty much the entire tier bar Normal-types like Heliolisk and Braviary. Roost is imperative to keep Xatu healthy throughout a match. U-turn lets Xatu be an efficient pivot, allowing it to keep momentum and give its teammates more opportunities to come in. It also lets Xatu not be bait for Pokemon like Incineroar and Heliolisk. Toxic can put opposing walls on a timer as well as help stall opposing Pokemon out. It’s also a great tool to punish Pokemon that would otherwise switch in for free, like Rhydon, Braviary, and Heliolisk. Protect lets Xatu scout for Choice-locked moves, most notably from Heliolisk, Passimian, and Sneasel. Toxic and Protect can also be used together by giving up some of Xatu's mobility with U-turn, letting Protect also serve as a powerful method of Toxic stalling the foe. This lets Xatu beat Pokemon such as non-Heal Bell Vaporeon one-on-one but also lets Heliolisk and Mega Glalie switch in for free due to the lack of U-turn. Defog can be used to remove Stealth Rock from Druddigon as well as from other setters that beat it, like Rhydon and Palossand.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Xatu's Speed EVs allow it to be faster than Incineroar. 252 HP EVs maximize this stat, and the remainder of EVs are thrown into Defense alongside a Bold nature to better take on physical attackers like Steelix and Passimian. Magic Bounce is key to let Xatu perform its role as an entry hazard deterrent. It also bounces back status moves like Toxic to severely cripple Slowking, Vaporeon, and opposing Xatu. Lastly, Rocky Helmet puts more pressure on Steelix while still annoying other physical attackers like Passimian or Gallade.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main point of using Xatu is to keep entry hazards away. It should always pivot on hazard setters it beats, like Steelix, Ferroseed, and Torterra. As for Stealth Rock users that can be a threat, it's important to ponder the risk of sending in Xatu on predicted Stealth Rock or potentially having it drop from a STAB move from Palossand, Rhydon, or Piloswine. If you have a Defog or Rapid Spin user it might be smart to not predict too much, especially if Xatu has any defensive value on the match, such as checking the likes of Passimian and Gallade. Try to keep Xatu healthy with Roost, as it can't switch into many Pokemon it would check if its HP is too low, and full health might be important to make a couple plays when dancing around Stealth Rock setters. However, it might be smart to U-turn out of potential threats to Xatu that would otherwise switch in for free, like Sneasel, Heliolisk, and Mega Glalie. Using Toxic on these is also an option, but be careful of opposing Xatu, as it will bounce Toxic back to your Xatu and severely cripple it. Protect should be used to scout against users of Choice items like Passimian, Sneasel, and Aerodactyl. Lastly, be very careful around Pursuit users like Sneasel if Xatu lacks Protect, as they can trap and eliminate it, allowing the opponent to set up Stealth Rock. This is especially important when Xatu is your only form of hazard removal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock are prime partners. Offensive pivots like Incineroar, Sneasel, and Heliolisk really appreciate a field clear off of entry hazards. Xatu can also bring them in reliably with U-turn. Meanwhile, defensive pivots, such as Vaporeon and Mega Audino, also appreciate the hazard prevention to consistently switch in on Pokemon they check. Secondary forms of hazard removal can be useful for balance teams that don't want to immediately lose to setters that beat Xatu. Silvally-Steel and Blastoise are great examples that can keep hazards away alongside Xatu. If your team can't fit a secondary form of hazard control, offensive Pokemon that can pressure Rhydon and Piloswine can be useful to keep them in check and punish Stealth Rock. Slowking, Passimian, and Heliolisk are great options for this. Considering how Xatu pretty much nullifies Steelix's presence in a match, partners like Heliolisk and Comfey that struggle with it are great choices. Defensive Pokemon that can cover up Xatu's weaknesses are solid teammates. Steelix, Ferroseed, and Silvally-Steel take on a couple threats to Xatu, such as Vikavolt, Rotom, Heliolisk. Likewise, Hariyama and other Fighting-types can cover Xatu's Dark-type weakness, mainly Sneasel, as it can Pursuit trap Xatu.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking boasts excellent defensive typing, a great ability in Regenerator, and exceptional special bulk as well as good physical bulk, making it one of NU's most reliable defensive pivots, taking on Passimian, Delphox, and Mega Glalie reliably. Access to strong STAB moves, including Scald, Future Sight, and Psyshock, as well as good base 100 Special Attack means that Slowking is no slouch offensively either. This is accentuated by its wide variety of coverage move that include Fire Blast, Grass Knot, and Ice Beam, making Slowking difficult for anything but a dedicated wall to switch into. A wide utility movepool with Dragon Tail, Slack Off, Toxic, Nasty Plot, and Calm Mind means that Slowking can be customized for most teams. However, as its name suggests, Slowking is outrun by essentially every offensive Pokemon in NU as well as most walls, making it fairly easy to revenge kill. Additionally, Slowking is very vulnerable to Toxic, as any passive damage reduces the recovery it gets from Regenerator, hurting its ability to pivot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set of Block / Calm Mind / Scald / Rest can function as a potent trapper, eliminating Water-types such as Blastoise and Vaporeon as well as acting as a potent sweeper. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature should be used with this set, as well as Normalium Z in order to give Slowking a Defense boost from Z-Block. An offensive Trick Room set of Nasty Plot / Trick Room / Scald / Psyshock with Psychium Z and an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA with a Quiet nature can turn Slowking into a sweeper that can often beat offensive teams by itself; however, this set needs 2 turns of setup in order to sweep a lot of the time, limiting its effectiveness. Zap Cannon can be used on the Assault Vest set to potentially cripple Vaporeon and enemy Slowking; however, its low accuracy means it often does nothing, and Slowking often has to give up a more consistent option such as Grass Knot or Dragon Tail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Dhelmise is one of Slowking's greatest enemies, OHKOing it with Power Whip while having the bulk to switch into any of its moves at least once. Special wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeggutor and Sceptile can muscle through even Assault Vest Slowking, although Sceptile needs it to be weakened in order to KO it with Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Guzzlord is one of Slowking's greatest foes, taking little from Scald, Future Sight, or Fire Blast and threatening to heavily damage it with Dark Pulse or Knock Off, although it dislikes Dragon Tail. Incineroar, Pangoro, and Sneasel can easily KO the Assault Vest set with Darkest Lariat and Knock Off, although they fail to take out Colbur Berry sets as efficiently. Pursuit from Sneasel and Absol traps the Assault Vest set. Bulk Up Scrafty has the bulk to easily take almost any hit Slowking can throw at it and set up against it.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Slowking is often reliant on Regenerator to heal itself, so a source of passive damage such as Toxic from Druddigon, Vaporeon, or Seismitoad can result in Slowking getting worn down rather quickly. All three of these Pokemon can often switch into Slowking freely use Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Heliolisk and Rotom fail to OHKO Slowking, they can easily wear it down using Volt Switch, and neither is OHKOed by Slowking. Vikavolt can easily OHKO even Assault Vest Slowking with Savage Spin-Out, but it fears Fire Blast and cannot switch in easily. Heliolisk additionally takes no damage from Slowking's Scald, giving it many chances to switch in against it during a match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has good Base Power, has an incredibly useful burn chance, and hits common Pokemon like Rhydon and Incineroar, making it one of Slowking's most spammable moves. Future Sight lets Slowking support its team by setting up lose / lose situations for its foe when combined with a teammate such as Passimian, by removing Poison-types as a switchin to Passimian on the turn Future Sight hits. Alternatively, Psyshock is more reliable than Future Sight and 2HKOes Heliolisk while ignoring Comfey's Calm Mind boosts, preventing Slowking from being setup fodder for Comfey. Fire Blast hits Grass-types for very heavy damage, letting Slowking OHKO Sceptile after Stealth Rock, and provides good damage against Vikavolt and Heliolisk. Ice Beam can be used to hit Dragon-types such as Guzzlord and Alolan Exeggutor, OHKOing the latter, as well as heavily damaging Torterra, but it does not hit other Grass-types as hard as Fire Blast, lacking the ability to OHKO Sceptile. Dragon Tail lets Slowking prevent setup and force out a foe the turn Future Sight hits, potentially forcing in a target that can't take the move well. Grass Knot is Slowking's best way to hit Water-types, which otherwise wall this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>212 HP investment and an Assault Vest maximize Slowking's special bulk, letting it take attacks such as Sceptile's Leaf Storm. This investment is key to letting Slowking effectively check wallbreakers such as Magmortar and Sigilyph. 44 Speed EVs let Slowking outrun Palossand. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature increase Slowking's offensive presence significantly. Regenerator serves to keep Slowking healthy throughout a match by healing it when it switches out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Efficient usage of Regenerator is key to using this set correctly; try as much as possible to bring this set in against weak attacks such as Delphox's Flamethrower in order to heal Slowking. If the opponent has Pokemon weak to Future Sight such as Passimian and Weezing, try to use Future Sight and use Dragon Tail 2 turns later in order to try to force the Psychic-weak Pokemon in or to prevent your opponent from switching Psychic-resistant or -immune Pokemon in. Scald should also be used for this purpose if you predict the opponent to bring in an Incineroar on the turn Future Sight is due to hit. Scald is a very useful move early-game, as getting early burns on Pokemon such as Druddigon can help to wear them down, while burning potential switch-ins such as Sneasel can cripple them for the rest of the game. Dragon Tail can be helpful in an unsure situation, especially when Stealth Rock is up, as it can potentially weaken some of Slowking's answers. If Slowking is healthy, it can be used to scout almost any special hit in the game; it is often better for Slowking to take 70% from a Heliolisk's Thunderbolt than for a teammate to be KOed by Surf or Hyper Voice. Fire Blast or Ice Beam should be used if the opponent is predicted to bring in a Grass-type.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that want Poison- and Fighting-types KOed can make excellent usage of Slowking's Future Sight support. Passimian is an excellent example, as very few Pokemon in NU want to come in on its Close Combat on the turn Future Sight is due to hit. Comfey and Sceptile are excellent partners for similar reasons, being very difficult for opponents to deal with if their Poison-type gets KOed. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Rhydon, Garbodor, and Steelix is incredibly useful due to Slowking's Dragon Tail and ability to force switches. Pokemon such as Incineroar, Whimsicott, and Passimian help deal with Dark-types, and all appreciate Slowking's support, especially its ability to take on Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon. Pokemon that can switch into Electric-types like Heliolisk such as Dhelmise, Rotom, and Togedemaru help to prevent Slowking from being worn down by them. Similarly, Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Braviary, Incineroar, and Garbodor take on threatening foes such as Sceptile and Dhelmise. While Slowking does resist Fighting, additional checks such as Rotom, Garbodor, and Weezing help to reduce the stress placed upon it.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot lets Slowking beat Pokemon like Blastoise, Druddigon, and Silvally-Steel more reliably. Scald dissuades Dark-types like Incineroar, Pangoro, and Absol from directly switching into Slowking and is its best way of damaging Psychic-types like Delphox, Xatu, and Sigilyph. Future Sight is great for easing prediction and has very few safe switch-ins when boosted by Nasty Plot. Alternatively, Psyshock provides an immediate source of damage against Poison-types like Weezing and Garbodor as well as Heliolisk. Additionally, it is more reliable than Future Sight is after Shattered Psyche has been used. Slack Off increases Slowking's longevity and recover health lost to hard hits such as Choice Band Aerodactyl's Stone Edge and Medicham's Thunder Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 Speed EVs let Slowking outspeed Palossand, while the remaining EVs with a Bold nature increase Slowking's physical bulk so it can better check Pokemon like Passimian, Aerodactyl, and Rhydon. Psychium Z gives Slowking access to Shattered Psyche, which, in conjunction with Nasty Plot, lets it break through Pokemon like Druddigon, Vaporeon, and Seismitoad more easily and allows it to bypass Future Sight's delay to immediately hit Heliolisk. Regenerator provides Slowking with additional recovery, letting it delay its use of Slack Off and scout Choice item users like Passimian and Aerodactyl more reliably.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowking has phenomenal mixed bulk; as a result, it finds plenty of opportunities to switch in against Pokemon like Delphox, Passimian, and Rhydon and recover health with Slack Off, set up, or simply fire off an attack. It is also key to take advantage of Regenerator as much as possible by scouting Choice item Pokemon such as Passimian and Aerodactyl and switching into weak hits or non-attacking moves from the likes of Steelix and Xatu for free recovery. Due to how Future Sight works, it's a great way to ease prediction and make the opponent's plays more telegraphed. Make use of this by using Future Sight to force in Pokemon like Incineroar, opposing Slowking, and Pangoro and switching to the appropriate check, setting up with Nasty Plot, or using Scald. Timing the usage of Slowking's Shattered Psyche is very important to ensure the removal of bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, particularly when using Future Sight, which is less reliable at doing so. Although Scald is a very spammable move, be careful if the opponent has a Heliolisk, especially if using Future Sight instead of Psyshock, as it can switch into a predicted Scald to recover health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking is a great fit on balanced and bulky offense teams due to what it offers both offensively and defensively. Slowking checks a wide variety of Pokemon due to its excellent mixed bulk and defensive typing, so Pokemon like Incineroar, Pangoro, and Steelix that appreciate having checks to Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Passimian, and Delphox make for great teammates. Since Slowking can struggle with Heliolisk, especially when it lacks Shattered Psyche or Psyshock, it appreciates having teammates like Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Dhelmise that can deal with it. Aerodactyl can also threaten Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott, Passimian can deal with Dark-types like Incineroar and Pangoro, and Dhelmise provides entry hazard control. Slowking's ability to pressure specially defensive Pokemon like Druddigon, Seismitoad, and Vaporeon with Nasty Plot-boosted attacks is greatly appreciated by Pokemon like Magmortar and Heliolisk that share similar checks to it. Magmortar can also take out Grass-types, while Heliolisk helps with opposing Slowking.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has usable Base Power, an incredibly useful burn chance, and the ability to hit Pokemon such as Rhydon and Incineroar for super effective damage, making it one of Slowking's most spammable moves. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Weezing and Garbodor and Fighting-types such as Passimian for heavy damage and prevents Heliolisk from freely switching into Slowking. Toxic provides a very valuable source of passive damage for Slowking, letting it easily wear down bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Seismitoad, and other Slowking as well as the likes of Druddigon and Comfey. Calm Mind is an option that turns Slowking into a useful late-game sweeper. Slack Off lets Slowking stay in against and beat Pokemon such as defensive Incineroar and Passimian. Future Sight can be run over Psyshock to further support Slowking's team and be used to great effect with Spikes support due to the switches it forces; however, the lack of an immediate Psychic-type attack can leave Slowking walled by Heliolisk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Near maximum physical bulk lets Slowking take attacks such as Passimian's U-turn and Mega Glalie's Double-Edge more easily. Regenerator helps Slowking pivot, letting it heal itself after switching out and easily sponge attacks such as Passimian's U-turn. A Colbur Berry minimizes the damage Slowking takes from Knock Off, letting it easily switch into and beat defensive Incineroar and Passimian as well as take on Pokemon such as Sneasel by making Pursuit far less threatening. Psychium Z should be primarily used with the Calm Mind set and gives Slowking a one-time nuke to break through Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, letting it OHKO Vaporeon at +3 Special Attack as well as providing a very strong initial hit if needed. This can also be used to provide an unexpectedly strong hit against Pokemon such as Garbodor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Efficient usage of Regenerator is key to using this set correctly; try as much as possible to bring this set in against weak attacks in order to heal Slowking. For example, bringing it into a Delphox's Flamethrower can often mean a net HP gain of 20%. Similarly, this lets Slowking easily come in on attacks such as Passimian's U-turn with minimal HP loss. As this set often aims to stay in longer than other Slowking sets, keeping Slowking free of Toxic can be very important. Try to scout for Toxic against walls that might carry it such as Steelix and Druddigon. Thanks to Regenerator, Slowking is often free to use its STAB attacks to damage the opponent's team or to use Toxic to potentially cripple an important threat, as it can heal up easily by switching out rather than needing to use Slack Off. Calm Mind should be used when the opponent no longer has efficient ways to break through a boosted Slowking; if using Calm Mind, be careful to prevent Slowking from being badly poisoned, and generally do not attempt to set up until all Toxic users are KOed. Thanks to its burn chance and good Base Power, Scald is often very difficult for the opponent to punish, making it a safe choice in unsure situations; however, be wary that it does not accidentally burn a Toxic target such as enemy Slowking or Blastoise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Incineroar, Steelix, and Heliolisk appreciate Slowking's ability to come in on almost any move from Passimian as well as beat other Fighting-types. Fairy-types such as Whimsicott and Comfey appreciate Slowking's ability to beat Poison-types and Steelix for them, and in return they can take on the Dark-types that trouble Slowking. Pokemon such as Pangoro, Whimsicott, and Passimian help deal with Dark-types and appreciate Slowking taking on Fighting-, Ground-, and Poison-types for them. Heliolisk switch-ins such as Dhelmise, Togedemaru, and Torterra are good teammates, as Slowking can often let Heliolisk in for free and does not appreciate taking Volt Switch. Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Weezing, Incineroar, and Garbodor take on foes that would either heavily damage or KO Slowking. Weezing and Garbodor can also set up Spikes, which can help wear down Sceptile and Heliolisk. Mega Audino can provide useful Heal Bell support, appreciates Slowking's ability to switch into Fighting-type attacks for it, and can function as part of a very potent Regenerator core with it. Mega Audino's sheer special bulk also means it can often take on special attackers such as Heliolisk, Rotom, and Guzzlord, all of which trouble Slowking.</p>"

Steelix is also a great Stealth Rock setter because of this, using its top-quality defensive traits to switch in multiple times if needed to set entry hazards. Unfortunately, Steelix is vulnerable to a wide variety of common Pokemon such as Slowking, Alolan Exeggutor, and Delphox due to its typing and below-average special bulk, and its passivity means it can be exploited by certain setup Pokemon such as Scrafty and Sigilyph as well as other entry hazard setters in Weezing and Seismitoad. Furthermore, Steelix struggles to reliably set Stealth Rock against teams with Xatu, relying on Curse to have any chance of threatening it, as well as Blastoise, which can easily switch into Steelix and force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar is a viable fourth option on Steelix to prevent Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary from using it as setup fodder. An EV spread of 252 HP / 108 Atk / 148 SpD with a Brave nature can be used to let Steelix OHKO Xatu after two Curses. Steelix can run specially offensive sets with Life Orb and Sheer Force to surprise switch-ins such as Xatu, Rotom, defensive Slowking, and opposing Steelix, although the loss of bulk hurts Steelix's ability to check Pokemon like Heliolisk and Whimsicott.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Blastoise, Seismitoad, and Vaporeon all switch into Steelix with ease and can remove Toxic poison thanks to Refresh and Heal Bell. Additionally, Blastoise can spin away Stealth Rock. Slowking can easily take any of Steelix's hits and threaten it back with Scald, although it doesn't enjoy being badly poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Unless running Curse, Steelix is useless against Xatu. Xatu can use Roost to stall out Steelix's Heavy Slam PP and bounce Stealth Rock back thanks to Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Alolan Exeggutor doesn't enjoy being poisoned by Toxic, but it takes negligible damage from Steelix's attacks and threatens heavy damage. Decidueye doesn't switch into Heavy Slam well, but it can remove Stealth Rock with Defog and heavily damage Steelix. Sceptile takes decent damage from Heavy Slam but targets Steelix's lesser special bulk with its strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Although they can't switch in well, Pokemon such as Sigilyph, Magmortar, and Delphox can take advantage of Steelix's lesser special bulk by virtue of their strong special attacks. Rotom and Vikavolt can easily switch into Steelix's STAB attacks thanks to their typing and ability and threaten it with heavy damage, while Weezing and Palossand's bulk means they take little from Steelix.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steelix is a great Stealth Rock setter due to its bulk giving it multiple opportunities to set it up. Heavy Slam targets Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott and does decent damage to neutral targets due to Steelix's great weight. Earthquake hits Fire-types such as Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar that may try to switch into Steelix as well as Heliolisk. Toxic cripples common switch-ins like Slowking, Dhelmise, and Palossand, while Protect helps Steelix rack up Leftovers recovery and scout Choice item users such as Passimian and Heliolisk. Alternatively, Steelix can forgo Earthquake to run both Toxic and Protect, although Earthquake is usually preferred to better punish Fire-types. Curse is an option that helps Steelix beat Dhelmise, Xatu, and Braviary, although Toxic and Protect provide more utility overall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Careful nature improves Steelix's overall bulk and helps it better take on Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Comfey, and Whimsicott. Leftovers provides Steelix with a source of recovery. Sturdy is fairly situational but prevents Steelix from being OHKOed by attacks like Magmortar and Delphox's Fire Blast, letting it retaliate with Earthquake or set Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to Steelix's great defenses, it finds many opportunities to switch into Pokemon such as Sneasel and Garbodor. Take advantage of these Pokemon being forced out by setting Stealth Rock. Steelix commonly draws in forms of entry hazard control, particularly Xatu, Blastoise, and Rotom. While Steelix can badly poison Rotom, it is rather useless against the former two, so it's usually best to simply double switch out if expecting one of them to switch in. If running Protect, use it to scout Choice item Pokemon such as Passimian and Heliolisk that may predict Steelix to switch out and not use the proper coverage move. Thanks to Sturdy, Steelix will never be threatened with an OHKO even when faced with Pokemon such as Delphox and Magmortar; use this to your advantage if Steelix is expendable by retaliating with Earthquake or setting Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steelix can easily slot onto any balance team by virtue of the great role compression it offers. Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Dhelmise, and Sceptile pair great with Steelix due to their ability to reliably deal with bulky Water-types. In return, Steelix provides the latter two with a good switch-in to Flying-types, and Steelix's Stealth Rock support helps all three wallbreak more effectively. Bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Blastoise, and Vaporeon are ideal partners for their ability to manage Fire-types for Steelix. Slowking also provides a switch-in to Fighting-types, while Blastoise and Vaporeon provide extra utility in Rapid Spin, Wish, and Heal Bell support. Steelix helps check Electric-types in return. Steelix appreciates Fighting-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Garbodor, Rotom, and Sigilyph, particularly if running Protect. Garbodor can switch into Fighting-type attacks and set Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Rotom can remove opposing entry hazards, and Sigilyph can wallbreak or set up with Calm Mind and Cosmic Power.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>Sneasel is one of the most dominant Pokemon in NU thanks to its fearsome combination of power, speed, and a spectacular offensive typing. With access to a powerful STAB move in Knock Off, Sneasel can devastate defensive and offensive teams alike. Furthermore, Sneasel is a fantastic Pursuit trapper and can remove dangerous Pokemon such as Sigilyph, Mismagius, Delphox, and Slowking for the rest of its team to take advantage of. Sneasel can fit on any team archetype with the appropriate support and almost always pulls its weight. However, while good offensively, Sneasel's poor defensive typing and low bulk mean it cannot switch into or withstand many attacks, making it more difficult to effectively Pursuit trap bulkier foes. It is also extremely vulnerable to the most powerful offensive Pokemon in the tier, Incineroar, as Sneasel has little to touch it with outside of the rare Low Kick.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set with Fightinium Z can be used to break through Incineroar, but Sneasel finds very few opportunities to set up. Dread Plate can be used to bluff a Choice Band set, but Sneasel sorely misses the power it gains from Choice Band.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Incineroar</strong>: Incineroar easily handles any of Sneasel's standard moves due to its typing and Intimidate, and can either set up Swords Dance or threaten with a Fire-type move or U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Comfey and Aromatisse can easily switch into Knock Off, but they both get worn down quickly and take considerable damage from Icicle Crash. Whimsicott can outspeed and OHKO Sneasel with Moonblast, but Sneasel can KO it with Ice Shard with some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hariyama serves as a reliable check to Sneasel, as it can easily tank any of Sneasel's STAB attacks thanks to Thick Fat and retaliate with Close Combat or even pick it off with Bullet Punch if Sneasel is weakened. Passimian also serves as an excellent revenge killer, though it must be wary of getting its Choice Scarf removed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Fast Pokemon such as Accelgor, Whimsicott and Sceptile can easily outspeed and OHKO Sneasel due to its pitiful bulk, but they must be cautious of Ice Shard, which can pick them off when weakened, particularly Pokemon that are hit super effectively by it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon and Z-Refresh Blastoise can take on Sneasel quite well, tanking any attack with relative ease and can either threaten with Scald or recover off damage.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Steelix can serve as a temporary check to Sneasel throughout the match due to its high physical bulk; however, it is very easily worn down and hates losing its Leftovers. Likewise, Piloswine can comfortably take Icicle Crash, but without its Eviolite and reliable recovery, it will struggle to survive for very long. Moreover, Garbodor can chip away at Sneasel with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath recoil in an emergency.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Sneasel's strongest Dark-type STAB move and comes with the benefit of removing items such as Eviolite and Leftovers. Icicle Crash is Sneasel's strongest Ice-type STAB move and can hit Dark-resistant targets such as Aromatisse and Scrafty extremely hard. Ice Shard is used to pick off faster threats such as Sceptile, Accelgor, and Whimsicott as well as boosted threats such as Vivillon. Pursuit allows Sneasel to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius, Jellicent, Slowking, and Sigilyph. Low Kick is an alternative that can 2HKO many common Sneasel switch-ins such as Steelix and Incineroar, but these Pokemon are worn down quite easily by Sneasel's STAB moves regardless.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed amplifies Sneasel's offensive presence. Choice Band substantially increases Sneasel's damage output and doesn't inflict residual damage, unlike Life Orb. Sneasel's abilities are mostly irrelevant, but Inner Focus can occasionally be helpful versus Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan and Hariyama.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sneasel is very frail; therefore, it should not be directly brought in on any attacks other than Choice-locked Psychic-type moves and weak resisted hits such as defensive Cryogonal's Freeze-Dry. However, don't be afraid to apply pressure with Sneasel should you predict the opponent to use a recovery move, set up, or switch out. Sneasel can be brought in safely either through slow pivots to terrorize slower teams or on free switches to maximize its longevity while still placing enormous strain on the opponent. Sneasel should often use Knock Off to cripple incoming switch-ins and deal huge amounts of damage, while Icicle Crash can be used against Pokemon that resist Dark. Sneasel can also be used as a very effective revenge killer, either by trapping weakened threats with Pursuit or by simply outspeeding and KOing them with the appropriate STAB move. Be wary of locking Sneasel into Pursuit should the opponent have threatening sweepers such as Klinklang and Scrafty, which can take advantage of the situation and freely set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Pursuit support generally go very well with Sneasel. For example, Fighting-types such as Passimian and Medicham detest Psychic- and Ghost-types, and in return they can obliterate bulkier Pokemon that Sneasel has trouble with such as Steelix, Incineroar, Scrafty, and Piloswine. Pivots such as Xatu and Rotom can bring in Sneasel safely and keep up momentum. Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing make great partners, as they can come in on Fairy- and Fighting-types, which threaten Sneasel. The former can also set up Spikes to chip away at the opposing side, while the latter can come in on Steelix freely. Sneasel appreciates hazard control from Rotom, Blastoise, and Xatu to keep healthy and reduce passive damage from entry hazards. Furthermore, Psychic-types such as Sigilyph and Slowking work quite well with Sneasel, as they can remove bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor, as well as Fighting-types such as Passimian. In return, Sneasel can trap opposing Psychic-types as well as Ghost-types for them. While Sneasel thrives on offensive teams, it can also be fit onto bulkier teams, which appreciate its Speed and trapping capabilities. For example, Vaporeon appreciates Sneasel's ability to trap Water-types such as Slowking, as well as threaten Grass-types, and in return, it can perform clerical duties to keep Sneasel healthy as well as pivot into Fire-types such as Incineroar and Delphox.</p>"

  "Piloswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Piloswine is a decent offensive Stealth Rock setter thanks to its unique STAB combination and access to priority in Ice Shard, which allows it to threaten Xatu as well as most other Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and Druddigon and take out entry hazard removers like Dhelmise and Golbat. It is also quite bulky, with its typing, ability to utilize Eviolite, and Thick Fat ability making it a decent check to Pokemon such as Garbodor and defensive Incineroar. However, Piloswine is unable to do much to the bulky Water-types of NU such as Blastoise, Slowking, and Vaporeon and has a poor matchup against Fighting-types such as Passimian, Pangoro, and Medicham. Piloswine also needs its Eviolite in order to tank certain hits, so losing the item could be detrimental to its team's defensive core. Piloswine will get worn down fast due to its lack of recovery options and having to constantly switch into resisted hits. Other Stealth Rock setters give Piloswine some hefty competition; Rhydon has a stronger offensive and defensive presence, Druddigon has other utility options such as Glare, and Steelix is much bulkier, has a better defensive typing, and can threaten certain Pokemon by boosting with Curse.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic could catch bulky Water-types off guard as they pivot into Piloswine, but Piloswine can't really do much else to these Pokemon afterwards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blatoise can all comfortably take any attack Piloswine goes for and threaten it out with either Toxic or a burn from Scald. Blastoise can also clear Stealth Rock after it forces Piloswine out.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Passimian, Pangoro, and Medicham threaten Piloswine out of the match, but they do not want to switch directly into Piloswine and can be revenge killed by Ice Shard if they are weakened enough.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because Piloswine lacks a reliable method of recovery, it is often worn down by repeatedly switching into resisted hits and entry hazards. Piloswine does not take status conditions well; Toxic poison from switching into Toxic Spikes puts it on a timer, while burns from Will-O-Wisp severely weaken its offensive output.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Sceptile, Whimsicott, Alolan Exeggutor, and offensive Deciduye can easily come in after a teammate has been knocked out and force Piloswine out with their powerful STAB moves if they are at full health. Decidueye can even clear Piloswine's Stealth Rock with Defog if it has been forced out with the threat of Bloom Doom. However, none of them want to come in on Piloswine's Icicle Crash directly, and all are threatened by Ice Shard if they have been weakened enough.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Piloswine makes for a decent offensive Stealth Rock user thanks to its STAB combination that can punish opposing Stealth Rock setters like Druddigon and Rhydon and entry hazard removers like Dhelmise and Golbat. Icicle Crash hurts foes that don't care about Earthquake like Xatu, Alolan Exeggutor, Rotom, and Vikavolt. Earthquake deals a considerable amount of damage to Garbodor, Steelix, and Incineroar and hits bulky Water-types like Slowking and Blastoise. Ice Shard is crucial for revenge killing weakened, faster threats such as Aerodactyl, Sceptile, and Vivillon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment make Piloswine as powerful as possible, threatening Pokemon like Garbodor and Alolan Exeggutor, while maximum HP investment with Thick Fat and an Eviolite let it take hits from Pokemon like Incineroar, Aerodactyl, and Sneasel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Piloswine has positive matchups against opposing entry hazard setters such as Garbodor and Druddigon and certain entry hazard clearers such as Xatu and Dhelmise, so using Piloswine as a lead can be a good idea. Piloswine should aim to set Stealth Rock as soon as possible to maximize its offensive output. Once Stealth Rock is set, Piloswine can begin wallbreaking early- and mid-game or potentially pick off certain offensive threats late-game with Ice Shard. Piloswine can attempt to pivot into Pokemon it can take a hit from like defensive Incineroar, Sneasel locked into an Ice-type move, and Electric-types like Heliolisk and Rotom. Be aware that this can also be risky, since Sneasel could just as easily use Knock Off as Piloswine comes in, and Heliolisk and Rotom can stop it by using moves like Surf, Hyper Voice, and Will-O-Wisp. While Earthquake should be used the most out of all of Piloswine's moves thanks to its lack of drawbacks, if the opponent has multiple switch-ins to Ground-type moves like Decidueye, Sigilyph, and Xatu, using Icicle Crash to catch them off guard would be a good idea.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Piloswine fits best on offensive teams that don't want a passive Stealth Rock setter like Steelix. Having a partner that can beat bulky Water-types for Piloswine is a good idea, so pairing it with a Pokemon like Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Vikavolt is always wise. Other Pokemon like Xatu, Slowking, and Comfey can threaten Fighting-types for Piloswine. Comfey also appreciates Piloswine's ability to beat Poison-types so it has an easier time sweeping later in the match. A spinblocker can help keep Piloswine's Stealth Rock intact, so Pokemon like Rotom, Dhelmise, and Mismagius can make for good teammates. Passimian is also an excellent partner for Piloswine because it can safely bring Piloswine into battle with U-turn, allowing it to either safely set Stealth Rock or fire off a powerful attack. Garbodor can form an entry hazard stacking core with Piloswine, providing the team with a Fighting-type switch-in, and it can absorb Toxic Spikes for Piloswine. Garbodor also appreciates Piloswine's ability to threaten Xatu, allowing it to set Spikes much more easily. Pokemon such as Incineroar, Braviary, and Vivillon appreciate Piloswine's ability to threaten Stealth Rock setters. A cleric like Vaporeon can be a good idea, since it can heal Piloswine if it has taken prior damage or been crippled with status. Vaporeon can also switch into Scald for Piloswine, while Piloswine can cover Electric-types for it.</p>"

Outside of this niche, however, other hazard removers and Fighting-type Pokemon offer much more utility or power. Hitmontop's exploitable weaknesses, lack of reliable recovery, and only good bulk mean that it gets worn down incredibly quickly without Wish support, leaving it very easily taken advantage of. It also relies on only Fighting-type STAB attacks and Toxic for damage, so it is easily walled by Fighting-resistant and Poison-immune Pokemon such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Golbat. This means that Hitmontop only finds a secure niche on stall teams that need a decent Incineroar check and entry hazard control.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake lets Hitmontop hit Garbodor harder than it would with Close Combat so that Garbodor doesn't set up Toxic Spikes in front of it. However, the utility of Foresight or Protect is preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Psychic-type Pokemon such as Xatu and Slowking resist Close Combat and threaten Hitmontop with powerful STAB moves. Xatu and Sigilyph are effectively immune to Toxic, meaning that they completely wall Hitmontop.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon are some of the biggest thorns in Hitmontop's side. Golbat is the most notable check because it is immune to Toxic and retaliates with Brave Bird. Vivillon can put Hitmontop to sleep with Sleep Powder and then can set up with Quiver Dance against it. While Braviary is not a direct switch-in to Close Combat, it does reliably KO Hitmontop with Brave Bird and can stall Close Combat out with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott resist Close Combat and threaten Hitmontop with powerful STAB attacks. Mega Audino doesn't resist Close Combat, but it still threatens Hitmontop with Dazzling Gleam and can shrug off Toxic with Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Golbat resist Hitmontop's Fighting STAB attacks and are immune to Toxic, which gives Hitmontop more trouble because it cannot do much damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hitmontop lacks reliable recovery, so Toxic poison and burns wear it down incredibly quickly. Hitmontop also hates Toxic Spikes from Garbodor, as it has to switch in in order to remove them, leaving it poisoned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Hitmontop to clear entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes for its teammates. Foresight lets Hitmontop clear entry hazards on Ghost-type Pokemon such as Palossand, Decidueye, and Rotom. It also allows Hitmontop to hit them with Close Combat. Protect is a great move for scouting Choice-locked sets, racking up Toxic damage, and getting extra recovery with Leftovers. Close Combat is a decently powerful STAB attack that prevents Hitmontop from being setup bait, and it also threatens common Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon and Steelix. Low Kick is an alternate move that doesn't drop Hitmontop's defenses. Toxic puts bulky Fighting-resistant or -immune Pokemon like Slowking and Palossand on a timer.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Hitmontop to be as physically bulky as possible so it can pivot into Pokemon like Incineroar, Sneasel, and Rhydon. Intimidate further bolsters Hitmontop's physical bulk and can aid teammates in setting up. Leftovers is Hitmontop's only form of recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmontop can be switched into common Stealth Rock setters, such as Rhydon and Steelix, and then use Toxic or Rapid Spin against them as they are forced out by the threat of Close Combat. Should the opponent switch into a Ghost-type Pokemon, use Foresight to either hit it with a STAB attack or clear entry hazards against it the next turn. Keep an eye on Hitmontop's HP because it needs to be as healthy as possible so it can spin hazards away. Although Hitmontop can switch into Knock Off from Incineroar, Passimian, and Sneasel, this play is risky because Hitmontop will lose Leftovers, its only source of recovery. Status ailments heavily wear down Hitmontop, so try to avoid them if you can, although Rotom will often burn Hitmontop when it uses Rapid Spin. Finally, be cautious about repeatedly using Close Combat. Continuous use of Close Combat causes Hitmontop's defenses to lower more and more, making it easier to KO after every use.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hitmontop fits on stall teams that need a reliable answer to Incineroar and Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon and Steelix. Hitmontop has no form of recovery outside of its Leftovers, so Wish passers such as Vaporeon, Mega Audino, and Delphox are mandatory to keep it healthy. On that note, Vaporeon and Mega Audino can also carry Heal Bell so that Hitmontop can recover from Toxic poison or burn. Grounded-poison-types such as Garbodor make great teammates to absorb the Toxic Spikes Hitmontop loathes. Hitmontop is vulnerable to Psychic-types, so partners that can deal with them such as Incineroar, Guzzlord, and Scrafty are also appreciated. Pokemon like Cryogonal and Mega Abomasnow are also needed to check the Flying-type Pokemon that prey on Hitmontop. Fairy-type Pokemon are an issue for Hitmontop, so partners like Steelix, Golbat, and Delphox help check these Pokemon. Pokemon such as Slowking, Delphox, and Palossand appreciate Hitmontop's ability to deal with Dark-type Pokemon. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard control such as Incineroar, Xatu, and Cryogonal love Hitmontop's ability to clear hazards, as well as its great matchup against Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon and Steelix. Spikes setters like Garbodor and Ferroseed appreciate the fact that Hitmontop does not remove their own Spikes when it clears entry hazards.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Sceptile is an offensive Grass-type with solid power that distinguishes itself from Whimsicott with its powerful STAB moves, strong coverage options, and great Speed. Sceptile is often a problem for offensive teams because of its Speed and great arsenal of moves, which let it easily clean a weakened team late-game. However, Sceptile is very frail, meaning it takes massive damage from any neutral hit and even resisted hits like Rhydon's Earthquake and Heliolisk's Thunderbolt. Despite its great coverage, Sceptile struggles against common Pokemon like Golbat, Weezing, and bulkier Vikavolt sets that tank its Leaf Storm and aren't hit hard enough by its coverage moves. Unfortunately, Choice Scarf users like Passimian, Braviary, and Accelgor all revenge kill Sceptile. The former two can also grab momentum, since U-turn heavily damages Sceptile. Additionally, priority users like Sneasel and Mega Abomasnow hit Sceptile for a lot of damage with a super effective Ice Shard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs gives Sceptile a greater boost in power than Life Orb, although Sceptile enjoys not being locked into a move so that it can better take advantage of its solid coverage. Substitute lets Sceptile make use of its ability to force switches and makes revenge killing it more difficult. Swords Dance + Sitrus Berry can make Sceptile a threatening sweeper once Unburden is activated, although Sceptile's poor bulk leaves it with few opportunities to set up.  Swords Dance + Rockium Z enables Sceptile to bypass Golbat after Stealth Rock, although such a set lacks any other practical use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Golbat's combination of recovery, bulk, and typing makes it an excellent Sceptile check, taking very little from Leaf Storm and dealing heavy damage with Brave Bird. Golbat easily tanks Leaf Storm and uses the free turn Sceptile gives it to clear entry hazards with Defog. Garbodor can tank a Leaf Storm and threaten Sceptile out with Gunk Shot or go for Spikes. However, the former must be wary of a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Ice, while the latter is easily worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Passimian, Braviary, and Delphox can easily OHKO Sceptile before it can attack. Aerodactyl and Accelgor are naturally faster and can OHKO Sceptile with their STAB moves. Priority users like Sneasel, Mega Abomasnow and Comfey can force Sceptile out as well.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Sceptile is worn down very quickly between Life Orb recoil and entry hazard damage, putting it into the range of neutral attacks and priority moves that it would otherwise be able to take like Choice Band Sneasel's Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Magmortar and Incineroar can be problematic if Sceptile is at -2 from using Leaf Storm, because Life Orb-boosted Earthquake doesn't OHKO either and Focus Blast can't OHKO Incineroar with the Special Attack drop. Delphox also can take any hit from a Sceptile lacking Earthquake and threaten to OHKO it with Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Sceptile's strongest STAB move, and with a Life Orb it hits everything that doesn't resist it for heavy damage, notably Heliolisk, Steelix, and Sneasel. Even Grass-resistant Pokemon take heavy damage; Garbodor takes about 40% from it, while Xatu loses about half of its HP. Giga Drain is Sceptile's most spammable move, as it's 100% accurate and allows Sceptile to gain back health lost from Life Orb recoil and entry hazard damage. It pairs incredibly well with Overgrow, as the damage increase also increases the recovery. Focus Blast covers Steel-types like Silvally-Steel and Klinklang and Grass-resistant Dark-types like Incineroar and Guzzlord, hitting all for super effective damage. Earthquake provides coverage against Poison- and Fire-types like Garbodor and Magmortar, notably OHKOing Delphox thanks to Life Orb, as well as hitting Steel-types, though it offers lower overall damage than Focus Blast. Hidden Power Ice hits Grass- and Flying-types such as Decidueye, Xatu, and Golbat, having a good chance of 2HKOing Golbat after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb heavily increases Sceptile's power, and the recoil can be offset by using Giga Drain. If Sceptile is put into Overgrow range, either through Life Orb recoil or other damage, it will deal massive damage with its Grass-type attacks; Leaf Storm is especially powerful, while Giga Drain benefits from both the increased power and increased healing. A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs make Sceptile as fast as possible, outspeeding Whimsicott and Sneasel, while 252 Special Attack EVs make its moves hit harder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spamming Leaf Storm if the opponent only has shaky switch-ins to it, like Whimsicott and Incineroar, is a good way to pressure the enemy team early-game. Leaf Storm is Sceptile's strongest STAB attack, but its Special Attack drop and the risk of hard counters such as Golbat and Weezing switching into it mean Sceptile gets easily forced out, so coverage should be used when predicting common switch-ins. The Special Attack drop also invites in setup sweepers like Comfey and Incineroar. Use Sceptile's ability to outspeed almost everything in NU to its advantage by pressuring frail offensive Pokemon like Heliolisk and Choice-locked Sneasel. Sceptile gets worn down very quickly by repeatedly switching into Spikes and Stealth Rock, so it's best to remove these before sending Sceptile out. Don't hesitate to use Giga Drain when Overgrow is activated, as it actually hits quite hard, which allows Sceptile to gain health back so it can continue to punch holes. Earthquake can catch Fire-types like Incineroar and Delphox off guard after using Leaf Storm. Try to preserve Sceptile for late-game, as it can easily clean if the opponent's team is weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Piloswine pair very well with Sceptile. They can wear down many of Sceptile's answers such as Golbat and Silvally-Steel so that Sceptile can handle them more easily over time, and they also capitalize on the switches that Sceptile forces. U-turn and Volt Switch users like Passimian, Xatu, and Rotom can bring Sceptile in safely so it can punch holes without taking a hit first. The latter two can also act as hazard removers, increasing Sceptile's longevity. Rock-types such as Rhydon pair well with Sceptile because they can set Stealth Rock and check Fire-types like Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar as well as Flying-types. at the same time. In return, they appreciate Sceptile dealing with Ground- and Water-types. Together with Sceptile, Mega Glalie and Sneasel can put a lot of pressure on Fire-types as well as check Golbat and Decidueye. Fire-types of your own such as Delphox and Incineroar can gain free turns off of the Steel- and Grass-types that Sceptile brings in, such as Silvally-Steel and Decidueye. Pokemon like Druddigon and defensive Slowking that take advantage of pivoting Choice Scarf users are also good partners for Sceptile, as they prevent it from being revenge killed as easily.</p>"

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Thick Fat and Hariyama's respectable bulk, it can serve as an effective check to both Incineroar and Mega Glalie, two of the most threatening wallbreakers in NU, as well as to other Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon like Houndoom, Magmortar, Sneasel, and non-Wood Hammer Mega Abomasnow. Additionally, thanks to Hariyama's great Attack stat, it manages to have an offensive presence while maintaining its solid bulk, allowing it to differentiate itself from other Fire- and Ice-resistant Pokemon like Miltank, Cryogonal, and Alolan Sandslash. Unfortunately, Hariyama faces heavy competition from Passimian, which is also a mono-Fighting-type, checks similar Pokemon to Hariyama offensively, can provide its team with momentum thanks to U-turn, and fits on more teams given its reliability as a Choice Scarf user. Furthermore, Hariyama faces competition as a wallbreaker from Medicham, which is stronger, is faster, and has a secondary typing in Psychic, letting it more easily deal with bulky Poison-types like Garbodor and Golbat. Hariyama fails to check many special attackers like Slowking, Whimsicott, and Vivillon even with the help of Assault Vest, making it unreliable as a catch-all special attack absorber. Hariyama's vulnerability to status like burn and poison further hampers it and forces it to rely on Rest to remain healthy, which means forgoing Assault Vest and thus failing to check strong special attackers like Sceptile, Guzzlord, and Heliolisk. Lastly, Hariyama's poor Speed tier results in it usually being forced to move after the foe, meaning it will likely take a hit or be inflicted with status before it can act.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Guts set with Close Combat, Knock Off, and Facade makes Hariyama a good wallbreaker, although other Fighting-types like Medicham and Passimian are better wallbreakers because of a secondary typing and access to U-turn, respectively. Additionally, Hariyama's low Speed and poor longevity due to the burn from Flame Orb as well as Defense and Special Defense drops from Close Combat make such a set easier to play against. Hariyama can forgo Rest healing entirely and opt for a Toxic stalling set with Protect that lets it safely recover health with Leftovers, but such a set is much easier to wear down and more susceptible to status.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Garbodor and Weezing can easily switch into anything from Hariyama and use it as setup fodder for Toxic Spikes. Additionally, Weezing can cripple non-Rest Hariyama variants with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Choice Specs Whimsicott has an easy time breaking through even Assault Vest Hariyama with its strong Moonblast. Comfey and Aromatisse can use Hariyama as setup fodder, with Taunt Comfey having a particularly advantageous matchup against non-Assault Vest variants because it can prevent them from using Toxic. Mega Audino easily takes Close Combat from either variant and can remove Hariyama's item with Knock Off, crippling its ability to sponge hits. However, all of these Pokemon fall to Heavy Slam from Assault Vest Hariyama.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Physically defensive Slowking can easily take any hit from Hariyama, while Assault Vest variants threaten heavy damage but can't switch in as reliably due to their lesser physical bulk. Medicham can't easily switch into Hariyama, but it can easily OHKO Hariyama with Zen Headbutt with minimal chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Xatu is a solid defensive answer to Hariyama, not fearing Knock Off too much and slowly chipping away at it with Night Shade or potentially Psychic; however, it must be wary of Stone Edge. Golbat take little from anything Hariyama uses, although it doesn't want to lose its Eviolite to Knock Off, as this leaves it more prone to Stone Edge and Ice Punch. Although they struggle to switch into Hariyama, Pokemon like Braviary, Vivillon, and Scyther threaten to either set up on or massively damage Hariyama with their strong Flying-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Palossand and Colbur Berry Rotom are excellent defensive switch-ins to both Hariyama variants, as neither of them particularly fear Knock Off. Additionally, Palossand can continuously check Hariyama thanks to Shore Up, while Rotom can burn Hariyama with Will-O-Wisp and punish RestTalk variants with Hex. Decidueye and Dhelmise can pivot into Close Combat with ease and threaten to KO Hariyama with Sinister Arrow Raid and Power Whip, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat lets Hariyama deal with Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, Incineroar, and Rhydon. It is also Hariyama's most reliable form of damage output against neutral targets such as Blastoise, Vaporeon, and Seismitoad. Knock Off provides Hariyama with coverage for Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Xatu, Slowking, Rotom, and Decidueye while also removing the items of switch-ins like Blastoise, defensive Slowking, and Golbat. Heavy Slam prevents Fairy-types like Comfey and Whimsicott from easily switching into Hariyama by threatening to OHKO them. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Braviary, Vivillon, and Golbat while also doing more to Vikavolt than Hariyama's other moves. Ice Punch retains coverage against Flying-types and lets Hariyama threaten Alolan Exeggutor, Torterra, and Whimsicott with solid damage. Bullet Punch gives Hariyama the means to revenge kill faster, weakened foes like Whimsicott, Vivillon, and Accelgor. However, it is weak and lacks much use outside of revenge killing. Earthquake prevents Garbodor from freely setting Spikes versus Hariyama but is relatively useless otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature lets Hariyama hit as hard as possible, while maximum Special Defense investment with an Assault Vest lets Hariyama better take on special attackers like Rotom, Heliolisk, and Mismagius. Thick Fat is the preferred ability so that Hariyama can better check Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon like Incineroar and Mega Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Hariyama set should primarily be used as a switch-in to threatening special attackers such as Comfey, Heliolisk, and Houndoom. Due to its lack of recovery, it is imperative to avoid letting Hariyama take too much chip damage, as it will leave Hariyama an unreliable check to specially offensive Fire- and Ice-types. Additionally, while Hariyama can switch into weak Scalds from the likes of Vaporeon and defensive Slowking, it is not advised to do so, as a burn removes any offensive presence this set hopes to have. Although Thick Fat and Hariyama's typing allow it to switch into Incineroar and Sneasel fairly effectively, it is risky to do so, as Hariyama risks losing its Assault Vest to Knock Off and thus cannot check special attackers easily. Once on the field, Close Combat is Hariyama's best move to do solid damage to whatever switches in. However, if the opponent has a Fighting-resistant or -immune Pokemon, then Knock Off is better to remove their item. Furthermore, using Close Combat too often is detrimental to Hariyama's bulk, as it lowers Hariyama's Defense and Special Defense upon each usage. Knock Off is a very easy move to repeatedly use due to the low amount of drawbacks it has. It is best used early- and mid-game to cripple switch-ins like Weezing, Palossand, and Golbat by removing their item, making their presence less prominent late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hariyama essentially only fits on bulky teams that wish to make use of its ability to check specially offensive Ice- and Fire-types like Mega Abomasnow and Magmortar. Since this set is relatively easy to chip down and weak to status, clerics like Mega Audino and Vaporeon make for great partners, being able to keep Hariyama healthy enough to check what it needs to and keep it status free. Grass-types like Decidueye, Dhelmise, and Sceptile appreciate Hariyama checking prominent Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon like Sneasel, Magmortar, and Houndoom. Additionally, Decidueye appreciates that Hariyama can remove Golbat's Eviolite, making it much easier for Decidueye to deal with. In return, Grass-types deal with Slowking and other defensive Water-types for Hariyama. Rock- and Steel-types like Rhydon and Steelix can manage problematic Flying-types like Braviary and Vivillon for Hariyama. Additionally, the aforementioned Pokemon can supply Stealth Rock for Hariyama's team, helping it weaken the opposition with its strong attacks. Fast Pokemon like Delphox and Choice Scarf Rotom help keep faster foes in check. In turn, these Pokemon draw in Pokemon like Steelix, Rhydon, and Cryogonal that Hariyama can easily manage. Furthermore, Delphox and Rotom appreciate Hariyama's ability to check problematic Dark-types like Incineroar and Sneasel. Entry hazard control from the likes of Xatu and Blastoise helps prevent Hariyama from being worn down quickly by entry hazards. Knock Off absorbers like Vaporeon and defensive Slowking can switch into Knock Off for Hariyama so that its Assault Vest is not lost.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat lets Hariyama threaten Ice-, Dark-, and Fire-types like Mega Glalie, Sneasel, Incineroar, and Magmortar. Alternatively, Revenge makes good use of Hariyama's bulk, doubling in power if Hariyama takes a hit before its use without dropping Hariyama's defenses. Knock Off allows Hariyama to remove items from Pokemon like Blastoise, Garbodor, and Seismitoad while also providing coverage for Ghost-types like Rotom, Decidueye, and Mismagius. Alternatively, Toxic lets Hariyama cripple bulky Water-types like Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blastoise and still gives Hariyama the means to effectively punish Ghost-types. Rest gives Hariyama a way to remove status and recover any lost HP, letting it consistently check Incineroar and Mega Glalie. Sleep Talk prevents Hariyama from being unable to act while asleep, making it slightly more difficult to exploit with setup sweepers and entry hazard setters.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment coupled with near-maximum Special Defense investment and Thick Fat enables Hariyama to reliably check Ice- and Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Glalie, Sneasel, and Incineroar. The remaining EVs go into HP to optimize Leftovers recovery. Leftovers provides Hariyama with passive recovery, letting it potentially wait longer before using Rest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hariyama should be switched directly into Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Incineroar, Magmortar, Sneasel, and Mega Abomasnow to check them. Additionally, thanks to this set's usage of Rest, Hariyama can be switched into Scald from the likes of Vaporeon, Seismitoad, and Blastoise with less fear of a burn. Because this set is meant to function as a check to Incineroar, it is important to scout for Tectonic Rage, as it KOes Hariyama with minimal chip damage after a Swords Dance boost. Hariyama should use Close Combat against Pokemon it is super effective against like Steelix, Rhydon, and Cryogonal. However, avoid using it too repetitively, as the Defense and Special Defense drops can lead to Hariyama being overwhelmed by neutral attackers like Decidueye much more easily. If the opponent has a Ghost-, Poison-, or Psychic-type such as Rotom, Golbat, or Slowking, Knock Off is the optimal play, as these Pokemon are very likely to switch into Hariyama to check it. If using Toxic, it is generally safe to use it often early-game to badly poison bulky Water- and Ghost-types like Vaporeon, Slowking, and Palossand. Toxic can also be used to badly poison other switch-ins like Mega Audino and Druddigon. Once Hariyama is low on health or inflicted with status, it should prioritize using Rest to become healthy. When asleep, using Sleep Talk is the best play unless a double switch is predicted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hariyama fits on defensive teams that appreciate its ability to function as a check to Ice- and Fire-types like Mega Glalie, Sneasel, and Magmortar. Grass-types like Dhelmise, Whimsicott, and Torterra appreciate Hariyama's ability to check Ice- and Fire-types like Sneasel and Incineroar. In return, they exert pressure on bulky Water-types like Slowking, Vaporeon, and Seismitoad that can generally switch into Hariyama with ease. Clerics like Mega Audino and Vaporeon help to keep Hariyama at a high amount of HP with Wish and can wake Hariyama up after it uses Rest with Heal Bell. Dark-types like Incineroar and Sneasel help deal with Psychic-types like Sigilyph, Slowking, and Xatu. Sneasel and other Dark-types like Houndoom can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Sigilyph and Decidueye, making it easier for Hariyama to use Close Combat with ease. Poison-types like Garbodor and Weezing aid in checking Fairy-types like Whimsicott and Comfey that can give Hariyama severe problems. In return, Hariyama can quickly dispatch of Ground-types like Steelix and Rhydon. Additionally, grounded Poison-types can also remove Toxic Spikes upon switching in, preventing Hariyama from being poisoned and having to use Rest to remove the status.</p>"

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Medicham is one of the strongest physical attackers and one of the best wallbreakers in the NU tier due to its ability Pure Power combined with its extremely strong STAB moves and excellent coverage moves in Thunder Punch and Bullet Punch. Medicham also has a solid Speed tier for such a powerful wallbreaker, outpacing and KOing common Pokemon such as Garbodor and Decidueye, as well as outspeeding pretty much all defensive Pokemon in the tier. However, Medicham is very easily worn down with entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and potential Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage. Its low HP stat and defenses don't help with this either; Medicham can almost never safely switch directly in on any predicted attack, as it takes massive damage even from resisted hits. Medicham's main attacking move, High Jump Kick, isn't risk free either, as Ghost-types and Pokemon with Protect are commonly seen in the tier, both of which cause High Jump Kick to miss and Medicham to lose 50% of its health. Lastly, Medicham is outsped and KOed by most offensive threats in the tier, like Rotom, Heliolisk, and Comfey. Golbat also aims to outpace and KO it with Brave Bird.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up Medicham is a cool setup sweeper on bulky offense teams, being able to take Sneasel's Knock Off at +1 Defense and gain most HP back with Drain Punch. This set should run Electrium Z with Thunder Punch to KO all Slowking variants from full HP. This set lacks immediate breaking power, however, and it is not commonly seen for that reason. Choice Scarf Medicham can KO Pokemon like Heliolisk and Sneasel by surprise, but the surprise factor only works once, and after that, it is much easier for the opponent to safely switch into Medicham. Medicham could also opt to run Ice Punch over Zen Headbutt for a better matchup against Palossand while still hitting Golbat hard. This, however, makes the matchup versus Garbodor and Rotom much harder for Medicham.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Slowking</strong>: Defensive Slowking is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably beat most Medicham variants due to its resistance to both of Medicham's STAB moves; however, it has to be wary of Thunder Punch, since all Slowking variants are 2HKOed by Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Medicham has to be wary of Ghost-types switching in on its High Jump Kick, as they cause Medicham to lose 50% of its health. Most Ghost-types in the tier are either faster than Medicham, like Rotom and Mismagius, or bulky enough to take one hit from it. Examples of this are Palossand and Decidueye.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Whimsicott all pose a threat to Medicham, since they naturally outpace it and can all KO Medicham without needing much prior damage. None of these can safely switch in on Medicham, though, since the former two get OHKOed by High Jump Kick, and the latter one faints to a combination of High Jump Kick and Bullet Punch. Comfey is also a threat to Medicham, as it outprioritizes and KOes Medicham with Draining Kiss due to its ability.</p> <p><strong>Recoil Damage</strong>: All of Medicham's moves make contact aside from Psycho Cut, meaning it is very prone to being chipped away at by Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin damage, combined with Life Orb recoil and potential High Jump Kick crash damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Medicham's strongest move, doing big damage even to neutral or resisted targets. Zen Headbutt allows Medicham to hit most Pokemon that resist or are immune to Fighting such as Garbodor, Rotom, and Decidueye. Its flinch chance can also be a big deal in dealing with walls like Palossand. Thunder Punch is the best coverage move Medicham can use in NU, as it 2HKOes any Slowking variant. Bullet Punch allows Medicham to pick off Pokemon that could otherwise KO it, such as Sneasel and slightly weakened Whimsicott. Psycho Cut can be used over Zen Headbutt to avoid recoil damage from most notably Garbodor, as well as for its 100% accuracy, but it misses out on important OHKOs on Golbat and Garbodor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Medicham's already great Attack a boost. A Jolly nature is used to outpace common Pokemon like Garbodor and Speed tie with Passimian and Braviary, two Pokemon that could otherwise heavily damage Medicham. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs make Medicham as powerful and fast as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Medicham directly in on a predicted attack, since it's very frail and likely to take a big hit from any attack—even resisted ones. Rather, utilize teammates with moves like Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot to get Medicham in safely. While using High Jump Kick often seems risk free, be wary of the opponent potentially switching in either a Ghost-type Pokemon or a defensive Slowking. The former will cause Medicham to lose 50% of its health, whereas the latter is mainly a momentum drain. Since there aren't many hard counters to Medicham, people will often try to pivot around it as well as they can. Because of this, playing aggressively with Medicham, predicting switch-ins and hitting them with the appropriate coverage move, will mess up most defensive teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow U-turn and Volt Switch Pokemon like Incineroar and Vikavolt are great partners for Medicham, as they can guarantee a safe switch for it. Pursuit users, namely Sneasel, help Medicham spam High Jump Kick even more easily by erasing Ghost-types like Rotom and Dhelmise. Pokemon that can easily beat Slowking, like Heliolisk and Whimsicott, are great partners for Medicham, as defensive Slowking is one of the few mostly safe switch-ins to it. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Rotom or Silvally-Steel is very important for keeping Medicham healthy throughout the battle, since it is already prone to being worn down due to Life Orb recoil and other residual damage, and Spikes and Stealth Rock damage limits its opportunities to switch in even further. Garbodor is also a good partner for Medicham, as it deals with most of the Fairy-types in the tier and can also set up entry hazards for Medicham.</p>"

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>Absol excels as a balance breaker thanks to its gargantuan Attack stat in tandem with its solid offensive Dark typing, access to Knock Off, and various coverage moves like Superpower that allow it to break past Pokemon such as Slowking, Incineroar, and Steelix. Access to STAB Sucker Punch allows Absol to circumvent its average Speed by being able to strike offensive threats such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Delphox first. However, Absol lacks the ability to break through walls such as Colbur Berry Slowking and Vaporeon without a considerable amount of damage dealt prior, so they often force it out. Furthermore, Absol's abysmal bulk coupled with a reliance on Life Orb for maximum damage output makes it easily worn down and revenge killed by faster threats such as Passimian, Whimsicott, and Comfey, which also resist Absol's Dark-type STAB attacks. Comfey can additionally outprioritize Sucker Punch due to Triage. Absol competes with other wallbreakers like Incineroar, Dhelmise, and Medicham, which each offer a secondary typing, moves with higher Base Power, and more versatility between movesets. Incineroar and Dhelmise also offer more defensive utility in part by their typings and the former's access to Intimidate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is able to greatly enhance Absol's offensive performance, but its lackluster bulk and poor defensive typing limit what it can set up on, and in general such a set faces immense amounts of competition from Incineroar because of this. Absol must also forfeit the utility provided by Iron Tail or Pursuit. Darkinium Z and type-boosting items such as Black Glasses lack Life Orb's recoil, and the former can be used to punch through Pokemon like Slowking more quickly, but they tend to lack the damage consistency of Life Orb. For example, Heliolisk isn't guaranteed to be OHKOed by Sucker Punch, and Steelix is able to always take two consecutive Superpowers. Choice Scarf gives Absol the ability to outspeed a myriad of unboosted Pokemon without relying on Sucker Punch, but the inability to switch between moves as well as the drop in power takes away a substantial amount of its wallbreaking potential. Play Rough does high amounts of damage to Fighting-types like Passimian and Hariyama and lacks a downside such as Superpower's stat drops. However, this move's coverage is generally eclipsed by what's provided by Superpower and Iron Tail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Passimian, Medicham, and Gallade all outspeed and threaten to OHKO Absol with their respective STAB moves. Passimian additionally possesses a resistance to Sucker Punch, allowing it to perform consistently as a revenge killer. Hariyama's solid bulk allows it to comfortably switch into Absol if kept healthy.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: While they face the risk of switching into a potential Iron Tail, Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott resist Absol's other moves and hit it super effectively. Comfey and Aromatisse are able to use Absol lacking Iron Tail as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Whimsicott, Sneasel, and Passimian are naturally faster than Absol and threaten to target its poor defenses, and these Pokemon also possess a resistance to Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Absol requires an extensive amount of residual damage or team support in order to break past Pokemon like Pyukumuku and users of Colbur Berry such as Slowking and Palossand. If brought in safely, Pokemon like Steelix, Torterra, and Vaporeon can take any one hit and retaliate, with the latter also being able to potentially cripple Absol with Scald.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off serves as Absol's strongest STAB move with its general spammability and ability to cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Rhydon, Passimian, and Golbat. Sucker Punch enables Absol to get the jump on faster Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill it such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Accelgor. Superpower's coverage gives Absol the ability to OHKO offensive Incineroar variants at -1 after Stealth Rock damage and does considerable amounts of damage to walls like Steelix and Rhydon. The stat drops make this move difficult to repeatedly use, however. Iron Tail smacks Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott attempting to switch into Knock Off, OHKOing both. Pursuit can be run over Iron Tail to trap in slower Pokemon like Xatu and Assault Vest Slowking and can be used to engage in mind games against Pokemon threatened by Sucker Punch such as Heliolisk. However, do be mindful that this option forfeits Absol's ability to deal super effective damage to Fairy-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature maximizes Absol's offensive presence and allows it to outspeed maximum Speed base 70s such as Decidueye and Samurott. An Adamant nature misses out on outspeeding those but allows Absol to break through Pokemon such as Colbur Berry Slowking more easily. Life Orb enhances Absol's power, but it can wear Absol down rather quickly. Justified is a mostly situational ability, but it boosts Absol's Attack by one stage when hit with a Dark-type move, giving it a power gain when hit by moves such as Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Absol's wallbreaking potential is best utilized early-game, as it is able to wear down defensive checks with either Knock Off or a super effective coverage move. In particular, Knock Off is the best move to use early on against bulkier teams order to weaken defensive backbones like Seismitoad, Steelix, and Rhydon and is the strongest move against neutral targets like Garbodor and Torterra. Versus more offensive teams, Knock Off allows Absol to scout for potential Z-Move users such as Incineroar and Torterra. Have Absol brought in through slow, bulky pivots such as Xatu and Type: Null as to preserve its health as much as possible. Prediction plays a part in wearing down foes in order to maximize damage output; using Iron Tail on a predicted Fairy-type switch-in like Comfey allows Absol to weaken or remove its checks early on. Pursuit can be utilized in order to score damage on Pokemon that might attempt to switch out like Rotom and Slowking. Late-game and against frailer teams, Absol can use Sucker Punch to edge out faster Pokemon like Sceptile and Aerodactyl. If need be, Absol's susceptibility to being worn down can be taken advantage of in order to KO itself and generate momentum for another teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Absol forms a great offensive core with specially offensive wallbreakers such as Heliolisk, Alolan Exeggutor, and Sceptile, which are able to break down physical walls like Colbur Berry Slowking and Seismitoad and in return appreciate Absol's ability to cripple walls like Type: Null and Golbat. Absol thrives on getting in safely in order to start wallbreaking, so pivots such as Passimian, Rotom, and Xatu are able to accomplish this.The likes of Xatu and Type: Null are able to bait in Pokemon for Absol to take advantage of such as Guzzlord and Decidueye. Entry hazard setters like Steelix and Garbodor are able to quickly wear down the opposing team due to Absol's tendency to force switches. Garbodor is also capable of switching into threats such as Passimian and Comfey, as is Palossand to Pokemon like Passimian and Togedemaru. Fast Pokemon such as Sceptile and Choice Scarf Passimian greatly appreciate Absol's wallbreaking capabilities and are able to cover for Absol's average Speed and general reliance on Sucker Punch against quicker teams. Late-game sweepers like Klinklang and Vivillon operate best with bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Slowking and Silvally-Steel weakened and thus make excellent partners for Absol. Such Pokemon are additionally able to pressure Steel- and Fighting-types, respectively. Pokemon such as Calm Mind Comfey and Ferroseed greatly appreciate having Pokemon like Assault Vest Slowking and Xatu disposed of through Pursuit trapping.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Glalie is a potent wallbreaker thanks to its powerful Refrigerate-boosted STAB moves, solid offensive stats, and near-unresisted coverage between its Ice- and Ground-type attacks. Mega Glalie is also an excellent user of Spikes, as its ability to break past entry hazard removers such as Golbat, Silvally-Steel, and Dhelmise as well as threaten Xatu allows it to easily set them up and keep them on the field. A great Speed tier significantly bolsters Mega Glalie's matchup against offensive teams, letting it get the jump on a plethora of unboosted offensive Pokemon like Magmortar, Rotom, and Sigilyph. Unfortunately, Mega Glalie's mediocre bulk and defensive typing hold it back, as it sports weaknesses to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel-types such as Incineroar, Passimian, and Steelix. In particular, its weakness to all entry hazards in conjunction with Double-Edge's recoil makes Mega Glalie easy to wear down, leaving it susceptible to revenge killers such as Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Choice Scarf Passimian. Mega Glalie also struggles to break through common defensive Water-types such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blastoise given their resistance to Double-Edge and the negligible damage they take from Earthquake.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Return is a safer STAB option that doesn't deal recoil damage, but it is noticeably weaker than Double-Edge, failing to pick up guaranteed 2HKOs on Pokemon like defensive Seismitoad, as well as the OHKO on Rotom. Super Fang allows Mega Glalie to punish traditional switch-ins like Slowking and Steelix by cutting their HP in half but is otherwise weaker than its other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Mega Glalie struggles to break through Pokemon such as Slowking, Blastoise, and Vaporeon, and they threaten to burn Mega Glalie with Scald in return.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Passimian and +1 Scrafty have little issue outpacing and decimating Mega Glalie with their respective Fighting-type moves, though neither can switch in directly. Thick Fat Hariyama notably boasts a resistance to Double-Edge and takes a negligible amount from Earthquake, meaning it can often directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Delphox is able to outspeed Mega Glalie and OHKO it with Fire Blast, while Incineroar can survive Earthquake and obliterate Mega Glalie with Flare Blitz. Defensive Incineroar is also notable, as it's never 2HKOed by any of Mega Glalie's attacks and can use its Spikes against it by being brought down to Iapapa Berry's activation range more quickly.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While Mega Glalie is decently fast, it's still outsped by Pokemon such as Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Aerodactyl, all of which have the power or coverage moves to break through it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded switch-ins like Steelix and Incineroar, and Mega Glalie is an effective user of the move due to its ability to threaten Xatu as well as entry hazard removers such as Golbat, Decidueye, and Silvally-Steel. Double-Edge serves as a powerful STAB move, breaking through Pokemon such as Dhelmise, Palossand, and Guzzlord and 2HKOing neutral targets like Seismitoad and Berry Rotom. Earthquake rounds off Mega Glalie's coverage by targeting foes resistant to Double-Edge like Incineroar, Delphox, and Silvally-Steel. Explosion is a highly powerful nuke, exchanging Mega Glalie for the power to OHKO or heavily dent the majority of the tier. It also provides use in preventing entry hazard removal and generating momentum for Mega Glalie's team. Ice Shard is a viable option that's able to pick off would-be revenge killers like Sceptile and Choice Scarf Braviary, but Mega Glalie is often forced to drop Spikes or one of its fourth slot moves, making it lose a considerable amount of utility.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature maximizes Mega Glalie's offensive presence and allows it to outpace the likes of Rotom, Sigilyph, and Magmortar. An Adamant nature can be used to allow Mega Glalie to hit even harder, notably 2HKOing Mega Audino and offensive Incineroar, though it misses out on outspeeding Pokemon such as unboosted Vivillon as well as the previously mentioned Rotom and Sigilyph. Ice Body is Glalie's preferred ability prior to Mega Evolving as to gain slight recovery from hail set by Mega Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prediction plays an important part in order to get the most out of Mega Glalie's limited turns. While Mega Glalie can set up Spikes against passive Pokemon like Pyukumuku and Mega Audino, as well as when bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Slowking are predicted to switch in, common Stealth Rock leads such as Druddigon and Palossand are also threatened by Mega Glalie's Double-Edge, making them solid opportunities for Mega Glalie to lead off and set Spikes. Using Earthquake at the right time is beneficial to maximize damage output against Pokemon that otherwise threaten Mega Glalie like Silvally-Steel and offensive Incineroar. It's best to bring Mega Glalie in through pivoting moves such as Xatu or Incineroar's U-turn, as its mediocre bulk and common weaknesses make it difficult for it to hard switch into most Pokemon. Mega Glalie can apply the most offensive pressure mid- to late-game, when checks such as Vaporeon and physically defensive Slowking are weakened or eliminated and it can proceed to 2HKO the majority of the tier. Whenever Mega Glalie is no longer needed or it's otherwise important to get off damage, using Explosion heavily chips the opposing Pokemon and grants its team momentum. However, timing the use of Explosion is important, as switch-ins like Vaporeon, as well as users of Protect such as Steelix and Mega Audino, can punish it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Glalie best sees use on hyper offense or bulky offense teams due to its solid offensive presence but little to no defensive presence, which the latter can patch up. Mega Glalie can form a core with Stealth Rock setters such as Palossand, Torterra, and Steelix in order to stack entry hazards. These entry hazard setters also pressure checks to Mega Glalie like Passimian, Steelix, and Incineroar. Bulky Pokemon like Golbat and Slowking can pivot into revenge killers to Mega Glalie such as Sceptile and Passimian. Slowking, as well as other Water-types such as Blastoise and Vaporeon, also serve as effective stops to Fire-types like Delphox in Slowking's case and Incineroar in Vaporeon's and Blastoise's case. Slow pivots such as Xatu and Incineroar can safely bring Mega Glalie into play as well as bait in targets like Dhelmise and Rhydon. Xatu can additionally punish the use of Stealth Rock, which otherwise wears down Mega Glalie. Special wallbreakers such as Heliolisk and Alolan Exeggutor apply immense amounts of pressure to the likes of Vaporeon and Steelix, and they enjoy having Spikes up to fuel their wallbreaking. Electric- and Grass-types like Rotom and Decidueye benefit heavily from the removal of Ground- and Dragon-types such as Torterra and Druddigon. They help Mega Glalie in return by dispatching bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Vaporeon, as well as bringing it in safely through Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively. Both of these Pokemon, as well as other Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom, can also act as spinblockers. Setup sweepers and late-game cleaners such as Vivillon, Klinklang, and Passimian highly appreciate Spikes being up, as their ability to wear down the opposing team helps them fulfill their respective roles. They also appreciate Explosion's ability to heavily dent bulky Pokemon and provide momentum, further aiding them in cleaning late-game.</p>"

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>Regirock has many attributes that make it a solid choice as a Stealth Rock user in the NU tier. In particular, it is a great check to Fire-types such as Delphox and Incineroar, Flying-types such as Aerodactyl and Braviary, and other attackers like Sneasel and Mega Glalie. However, Regirock's pure Rock typing makes it vulnerable to several common attacking types, including Water, Ground, Fighting, and Grass, and prevents it from checking Electric-types as well as its fellow Stealth Rock setters in the tier thanks to its inability to block Volt Switch. Regirock also lacks any form of recovery outside of Leftovers and as such is prone to being chipped down over time, even by resisted attacks. Finally, Regirock can be a bit passive at points and often has to rely on Toxic to even touch Pokemon that hit it super effectively such as Dhelmise, Palossand, and Passimian.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Regirock has a decently sized movepool, very few other options are worth considering, as most of the time, its offensive potential is very much overshadowed by Rhydon, which has a better STAB combination. Rock Tomb slows down foes while dealing damage at the same time. However, it is quite weak, and it only really comes into good effect against Pokemon like Xatu and Swords Dance Incineroar. Thunder Wave can be utilized over Toxic to slow foes such as Sceptile and non-Choice Scarf Passimian down, but often the chip damage that Toxic provides is much more valuable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Thanks to hitting it super effectively and having the chance to burn Regirock with Scald, Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Slowking, and Seismitoad are good choices to take on Regirock. The best Regirock can do to these Pokemon is badly poison them, since they take rather paltry damage from Stone Edge, and the likes of Vaporeon and Slowking can heal themselves using Wish and Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Sceptile, Decidueye, and Dhelmise in addition to more niche options like Ferroseed and Whimsicott, can easily beat or cripple Regirock. In the case of Decidueye and Dhelmise, they can easily remove Regirock's Stealth Rock via Defog or Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: The likes of Passimian, Scrafty, and Pangoro easily resist Regirock's STAB attack and either break through it or use it as setup bait in the case of Scrafty and Pangoro. Scrafty with Shed Skin also takes advantage of Regirock's reliance on Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Palossand, Piloswine, and Steelix completely wall Regirock and hit it back with Earth Power or Earthquake. Steelix is even immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Regirock is easily pressured by entry hazards and status moves thanks to its lack of reliable recovery and lack of ability to heal off status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Setting up Stealth Rock is the main use of Regirock on a team. It makes for a good setter due to its good bulk and nice set of resistances. Stone Edge can hit many of the targets Regirock checks defensively, especially threatening Xatu, which can block its use of Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used for a more reliable way of attacking, as it has more PP and higher accuracy. Earthquake hits opposing entry hazard users such as Steelix, Garbodor, and Rhydon for super effective damage. Hammer Arm can alternatively be used to hit Magnet Rise Klinklang as well as Pangoro in addition to still hitting Steelix and Rhydon. Finally, Toxic badly poisons Pokemon that Regirock can't really touch effectively such as Slowking and Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy is used to avoid OHKOs from attacks such as All-Out Pummeling from Magmortar and +2 Tectonic Rage from Swords Dance Incineroar. Leftovers is the item of choice to give Regirock passive recovery, helping it last slightly longer during a match. The Attack investment allows Regirock to OHKO offensive Delphox and Aerodactyl with Stone Edge. The Special Defense investment on the other hand allows it to help check Fire-types such as Delphox and Magmortar while also giving the benefit of being able to take two Choice Specs Thunderbolts from Heliolisk a grand majority of the time. The rest of the EVs go into Defense to, along with an Impish nature and a gargantuan base Defense stat, allow Regirock to check multiple physically attacking threats such as Incineroar and Mega Glalie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Regirock can safely pivot into many key threats such as Sneasel and pivot Incineroar. It can easily use these Pokemon as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, and setting up Stealth Rock early on is crucial. When you predict Xatu to switch in, though, using a Rock-type STAB move is preferred. Although Regirock can safely pivot in on Fire-types, super effective coverage such as Earthquake from Incineroar, Grass Knot from Delphox, and Focus Blast from Magmortar should be taken into account as well. Toxic is best utilized when you predict that a Pokemon that Regirock can't take on too well, mainly defensive Water-types such as Vaporeon and Blastoise, as well as Grass-types like Decidueye and Alolan Exeggutor, will switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dhelmise can easily take on Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types that Regirock hates facing and provides Rapid Spin support to help against Regirock's vulnerability to entry hazards, while Regirock can handle Flying-, Ice-, and Fire-type Pokemon for it in return. Other Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Decidueye can provide similar defensive synergy. Water-type checks such as Blastoise, Druddigon, and Slowking are crucial, considering how badly Regirock performs against Water-types, especially bulky ones. Grass-type checks such as Incineroar, Golbat, and Ferroseed help out against Regirock's similarly poor matchup against the type. Wish users such as Vaporeon and Delphox can help with Regirock's lack of recovery. Vaporeon can also provide Heal Bell support, which helps with Regirock's vulnerability to burns and Toxic, and is immune to Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb. Spikes and Toxic Spikes users such as Weezing and Garbodor can form an entry hazard stacking core with Regirock. These two Pokemon in particular also resist Grass and Fighting, two types that Regirock is weak against. Pokemon that struggle with Fire-types such as Vikavolt and Comfey appreciate Regirock's ability to easily take them on. Similarly, Fighting-types like Medicham and Passimian appreciate Regirock's ability to take on Flying- and Poison-types like Sigilyph and Garbodor.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra's niche largely comes from its good coverage, access to Rock Polish, and solid natural bulk making it a functional late-game sweeper that can be difficult to take down without super effective coverage. Torterra can also support its team as a wallbreaker in matchups where sweeping is unlikely, which gives it some flexibility. Unfortunately, Torterra's low Speed makes it incredibly reliant on obtaining a Rock Polish boost to not be immediately threatened by the myriad of Pokemon faster than it, such as Aerodactyl, Sigilyph, Sneasel, and Delphox. Additionally, despite Torterra's great coverage, it struggles greatly with Pokemon like Weezing and Dhelmise that are too bulky to overwhelm without Swords Dance. Torterra is also marred by a neutrality to Water and a severe weakness to Scald, which harms its ability to be put on a wide variety of teams given the opportunity cost of using it over other, more consistent Grass-types like Whimsicott and Sceptile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Torterra can run a specially defensive set with a spread of 252 HP / 72 Def / 184 SpD and a Careful nature and a moveset of Wood Hammer / Earthquake / Synthesis / Stealth Rock or Swords Dance. This set lets it check Pokemon like Choice Specs Heliolisk, offensive Rotom, and Comfey. However, Torterra is unable to set Stealth Rock reliably against teams with Xatu, and it is completely walled by Pokemon like Weezing, Sigilyph, Vikavolt, and Golbat. Choice Band makes Torterra an immediately threatening wallbreaker due to its coverage helping it against typical Ground-type checks such as Vaporeon and Sigilyph. However, Torterra's low Speed and lack of defensive investment make it easy to revenge kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing's typing, ability, and great physical bulk enable it to switch into Torterra's moves with impunity and cripple Torterra with Will-O-Wisp or set Toxic Spikes. Even if Torterra uses Swords Dance as Weezing switches in, it has a good chance to survive +2 Continental Crush followed by Stone Edge if Will-O-Wisp doesn't miss.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon like Dhelmise, Alolan Exeggutor, Sceptile, and Whimsicott resist Torterra's STAB attacks and threaten it with heavy damage. However, the latter two risk fainting to Continental Crush after minor chip damage, while the former two are easily removed after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Although they can't switch into Torterra's Rock-type coverage, Pokemon like Sigilyph, Vivillon, Braviary, and Golbat can switch into Torterra's STAB attacks and threaten to OHKO or heavily damage it in return. Aerodactyl has an even more difficult time switching in, but it can also OHKO Torterra.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Sneasel and Mega Glalie can easily OHKO Torterra before it boosts its Speed, while Sneasel, Piloswine, and Mega Abomasnow can threaten it with Ice Shard afterwards. Choice Scarf Delphox and Magmortar can outspeed Torterra even after a Rock Polish boost and OHKO it with Fire Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is Torterra's best move to hit bulky Water-types like Slowking, Blastoise, and Seismitoad as well as Fighting-types like Passimian and Pangoro. Earthquake targets Fire-types like Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar while hitting Pokemon like Garbodor, Druddigon, and Guzzlord for good damage too. Stone Edge provides Torterra with coverage for Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Weezing, Dhelmise, Sigilyph, and Vikavolt. Rock Polish lets Torterra outspeed key threats like Heliolisk, Aerodactyl, Sceptile, and Magmortar, preventing them from revenge killing it. Swords Dance can be used to vastly improve Torterra's matchup against checks like Weezing and Dhelmise, although losing Earthquake means Torterra must rely on Stone Edge to hit Fire-types and its Z-Move to safely bypass Garbodor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature makes Torterra as fast and strong as possible, ensuring it outspeeds Pokemon like Choice Scarf Passimian, Sceptile, and Heliolisk at +2 and can beat them. Rockium Z gives Torterra access to Continental Crush, which lets it more reliably remove Flying- and Grass-types like Sigilyph, Vivillon, and Whimsicott. Alternatively, Bloom Doom OHKOes Pangoro and takes out Passimian after minor chip damage, as well as OHKOing Pyukumuku, giving Torterra a solid stall matchup. Bloom Doom also doesn't inflict recoil, which helps improve Torterra's longevity. Overgrow provides Torterra with a great boost in power to its Grass-type moves when it is low on health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Torterra should be preserved for late-game so it has the most HP possible when attempting to set up and sweep, you can still make use of its defensive utility by switching it into attacks it's immune to or resists from Pokemon like Choice Specs Heliolisk, Choice item Rotom, and Choice Band Aerodactyl. Furthermore, you can aggressively double switch Torterra in against slower Pokemon such as defensive Garbodor, Slowking, and Rhydon that it can threaten with super effective damage, potentially letting it get a hit off against one of its checks and giving it an easier time sweeping late-game. This can also allow Torterra to outright remove a check like Xatu or Vikavolt with a well-timed use of its Z-Move. When aiming to set up and sweep, ensure that Torterra cannot be immediately threatened by its foe; otherwise, it becomes very unlikely for a successful sweep to occur. If opting for Swords Dance, Torterra becomes a bit more flexible with its role; rather than being a dedicated late-game sweeper, it can also function as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker. Use this to your advantage by removing or heavily denting troublesome Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Alolan Exeggutor that could give Torterra trouble late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torterra excels on bulky offense teams that can make up for its inability to contribute much until late-game without Swords Dance. Special wallbreakers such as Rotom and Sigilyph pair great with Torterra; both can deal with Weezing very easily, and Sigilyph can also threaten Grass-types like Dhelmise, Alolan Exeggutor, and Decidueye. Pursuit trappers like Sneasel and Aerodactyl can help remove checks to Torterra such as Dhelmise and Sigilyph as well as pressure Passimian. Although Torterra is a Grass-type, it doesn't deal with Water-types as well as other Grass-types do because it fears Scald greatly. Therefore, Water-type checks like Heliolisk, Slowking, and Druddigon make excellent partners. Heliolisk and Slowking can also pressure physical walls, while Druddigon provides additional support in Stealth Rock and Glare. If running Swords Dance, Torterra is capable of supporting teammates such as Comfey and Passimian by pressuring shared checks and counters. In return, Passimian can deal with Fire-types like Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar.</p>"

  "Ambipom": {
    "overview": "<p>Ambipom's niche is in its access to STAB- and Technician-boosted Fake Out, which allows it to pressure most offensive teams with a relatively strong priority move. Furthermore, U-turn coupled with decent offensive stats allows Ambipom to act as an offensive pivot. However, STAB priority is much better on Pokemon such as Sneasel, Comfey, and Decidueye because not only do their priority moves provide stronger offensive coverage, they can also be used more than once after they enter battle. While Ambipom may be fast and decently strong, it cannot take a hit thanks to its poor bulk, and it has mediocre firepower due to being reliant on its Normal STAB moves for damage, rather than super effective coverage, which makes it difficult for Ambipom to even dent the top defensive cores in NeverUsed, which is why it is outclassed as an all-out offensive pivot by Pokemon such as Passimian, Heliolisk, Rotom, and Whimsicott. Ambipom is also very easy to wear down because it is vulnerable to all entry hazards, status conditions, and the recoil from Life Orb. All of these flaws make Ambipom a very poor choice to put on a team in the current NeverUsed environment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ambipom has a large movepool, but choosing any of these moves over the standard set is generally situational. For example, Seed Bomb can hit Rhydon, Palossand, and Blastoise, but replacing any move from the standard set allows more Pokemon to wall Ambipom. Silk Scarf can be used instead of Life Orb to boost Fake Out and Return's power with the nice effect of no recoil. However, the lack of immediate power on its other moves is noticeable. For example, Low Kick only has a slight chance to 3HKO Steelix where Life Orb guarantees it. Knock Off can be used to remove the opposing Pokemon's item and avoid being walled by Ghost-types. Using Skill Link in conjunction with Tail Slap seems appealing, due to the fact that the move can break Substitutes. However, this takes away from Ambipom's niche in NU because Cinccino is a far better Skill Link user thanks to its ability to threaten Rhydon and Palossand with Bullet Seed. Using a set with only Fake Out and Last Resort seems like a good option on paper, but in practice it is hard walled by all of the Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-type Pokemon in NU and requires too much support to function properly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-type and Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Even with Low Kick, Ambipom has difficulty beating Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon. All of them including Rhydon, Aerodactyl, and Steelix can take a hit from Low Kick and retaliate by setting up Stealth Rock, setting up, or hit Ambipom hard with powerful moves. Ferroseed can also wear Ambipom down with the combination of Iron Barbs and Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Every Fighting-type in NU can KO Ambipom with their STAB moves due to Ambipom's weakness to them. Some Pokemon like Medicham and Hariyama carry priority like Bullet Punch or Fake Out to revenge kill it. Choice Scarf Passimian is also notable because it outspeeds Ambipom and proceeds to KO it. However, none of them want to take a Fake Out if they are weak.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Ghost-types such as Palossand, Rotom, Decidueye, Dhelmise, and Mismagius can come in safely on Ambipom because they are immune to its STAB and resist U-turn. This is especially an issue should Ambipom run Low Kick. Keep in mind they are vulnerable to Pursuit, especially if they are Choice-locked.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Very few Pokemon in NU outspeed Ambipom naturally, but they do need to be wary about switching into Fake Out or Return. Sceptile, Whimsicott, and most Choice Scarf users outspeed Ambipom and can threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks or super effective Fighting-type moves such as a Close Combat from Passimian. Furthermore, Ambipom is susceptible to being revenge killed by common priority moves such as Sneasel's Ice Shard, Triage Comfey's Draining Kiss, and Medicham's Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Despite its decent Attack stat, Ambipom has trouble with physically defensive Pokemon because they all can stomach a hit and retaliate with crippling status or do hefty damage to it. Garbodor and Weezing's Rocky Helmet punish contact moves, and both can dish out sizable damage to Ambipom in return. Vaporeon can take multiple hits from Ambipom and can burn it with Scald. Druddigon can hurt Ambipom with Rocky Helmet damage and can cripple it with Glare. Pokemon like Torterra and Slowking can also shrug off a hit from Ambipom and recover their HP. Bulky setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Klinklang can stomach any attack from Ambipom and proceed to set up with Bulk Up, Dragon Dance, or Shift Gear.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out is Ambipom's only priority move, scoring free damage and a flinch on the foe. It also is relatively strong thanks to STAB and a Technician boost, making it an effective tool to check weakened threats. Fake Out forces a lot of switches, so it pairs well with Pursuit. Return is the second STAB option for high and consistent damage output. Low Kick inflicts important chip damage on Pokemon like Steelix, Rhydon, and Klinklang. Pursuit punishes the opposing Pokemon should they switch out on Ambipom and also gets a Technician boost should they stay in. U-turn allows Ambipom to switch out of situations it can't handle, allowing a teammate to come in and deal with it in its place.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs with a Jolly Nature and Life Orb ensure that Ambipom will be hitting as hard and as fast as possible. Technician is the best ability for this set because it boosts the power of Ambipom's Fake Out, turning it into an effective tool for revenge killing weakened foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ambipom is a full-on offensive Pokemon that checks frail threats with Fake Out. Fake Out is generally a safe play to make on the first turn and can be used mid- or late-game to check and revenge kill weakened threats. Keep in mind that a predicted Fake Out can lead to a switch to a Pokemon that can resist the move such as Steelix, Rhydon, or Rotom. Return should be used to get good, consistent damage on the opponent's team once Ambipom's normal checks and counters are gone. Low Kick should be used to get sizable damage on Pokemon like Steelix, Silvally-Steel, and Rhydon, which Ambipom can outspeed and has a chance to revenge kill with entry hazards up. Since Ambipom forces so many switches because of Fake Out, you could also take advantage of Pursuit to pressure the opponent even more. This is especially effective on Dark-weak Pokemon like Slowking and Delphox, and frail Pokemon like Heliolisk. Do not switch in Ambipom on any attack because it needs to be as healthy as possible to revenge kill weakened foes, and do not let it take any status condition. Burn halves its Attack, paralysis cripples its speed, sleep makes it a sitting duck, and Toxic depletes its HP, putting Ambipom on a timer. If you must switch in Ambipom, then a partner with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is highly recommended. Ambipom can also safely come in on a predicted double switch, but try to make sure that all entry hazards are cleared, since they cut into Ambipom's longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ambipom forces switches often, so Pokemon that can lay entry hazards on the field like Steelix, Piloswine, and Garbodor are generally appreciated. Garbodor is notable, since it resists Fighting-type moves and can proceed to lay down Spikes or Toxic Spikes. It also can remove Toxic Spikes for Ambipom. Ambipom often baits in Fighting-type Pokemon, so partners that can deal super effective damage to them such as Comfey, Delphox, and Braviary are generally appreciated. On the same note, Ghost-type partners like Rotom, Palossand, and Decidueye can safely come in on Fighting-type moves. Ambipom struggles to damage physically defensive Pokemon, so wallbreakers like Mega Glalie, Sceptile, and Heliolisk are much appreciated. Pokemon such as Blastoise, Sceptile, and Passimian, which can handle the Rock-types in NU, also make good teammates for Ambipom, and Fire-types such as Incineroar, Houndoom, and Delphox make decent partners not only for absorbing burns from Will-O-Wisp but also to beat the Steel-type Pokemon Ambipom cannot dent. Pokemon like Blastoise, Cryogonal, Xatu, and Silvally-Steel are also notable for removing entry hazards on Ambipom's side of the field, improving Ambipom's longevity. In Xatu's case, it can bounce back entry hazards with its Magic Bounce ability. A slow user of U-turn, Parting Shot, or Volt Switch like Incineroar, Silvally-Steel, or Vikavolt can safely bring Ambipom in on a threat it can pressure.</p>"

  "Mismagius": {
    "overview": "<p>Mismagius's solid Special Attack and Speed alongside Nasty Plot, its coverage options, and Z-Crystals make it a notable sweeper capable of threatening specially defensive Pokemon like Incineroar, Assault Vest Slowking, and Vaporeon. Mismagius's potency is furthered by useful utility options in Taunt and Protect, which provide it with insurance against status moves as well as faster Choice item attackers like Heliolisk, Passimian, and Braviary. Unfortunately, Mismagius is extremely prone to being Pursuit trapped by faster attackers like Sneasel and Aerodactyl due to its lacking physical bulk and typing. Furthermore, because Mismagius's overall bulk is so poor, it struggles to find opportunities to set up Nasty Plot. Due to its moves being only average in power, Mismagius is heavily reliant on Nasty Plot and Z-Crystals to break many defensive Pokemon like Druddigon, Mega Audino, and Torterra, meaning it often struggles to apply consistent offensive pressure to bulkier builds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute retains Taunt's status-shielding utility while also helping against other Pursuit trappers like Absol, Aerodactyl, and Houndoom. Furthermore, Mismagius can use a Substitute + Calm Mind set to take advantage of passive Water-types like Vaporeon and defensive Slowking that cannot easily break a boosted Mismagius's Substitute. However, Calm Mind sets struggle to boost quickly enough to effectively threaten less passive teams. On dual screens teams, Mismagius can use Memento on Nasty Plot sets to further augment the threat of a teammate setting up, although Mismagius itself then becomes more vulnerable to status moves. Will-O-Wisp lets Mismagius punish physical attackers like Rhydon and Torterra for directly switching into it. This is best used alongside Hex so that Mismagius can break bulky Pokemon when unboosted more easily. Destiny Bond is a workable option to manage slower attackers like Incineroar and Guzzlord if Mismagius's Z-Move has been used; however, it is less consistent than Mismagius's other utility options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Guzzlord and Scrafty both are problematic for Mismagius; Guzzlord can survive +2 Continental Crush from full, while Scrafty doesn't fear Shadow Ball or Power Gem. Faster, frailer Dark-types like Sneasel and Choice Scarf Houndoom can't reliably switch into Mismagius, but they can revenge kill it and threaten to Pursuit trap it; additionally, Mismagius must fear Sucker Punch from Absol, although it can be played around. Mismagius can, however, dispatch of these Pokemon with Dazzling Gleam or, in Houndoom's case, Power Gem.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Mega Audino can survive +2 Continental Crush followed by Power Gem and defeat Mismagius with repeated uses of Knock Off. Druddigon is not OHKOed by any boosted attack from Mismagius and can phaze it with Dragon Tail. Assault Vest Hariyama can take even boosted Shadow Ball and KO Mismagius with Knock Off after a bit of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Due to Mismagius's poor physical bulk, Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Passimian and Braviary threaten to revenge kill it, although Passimian requires chip damage. Special attackers like Sceptile and Choice Scarf Rotom can also manage Mismagius, but its solid special bulk makes it more difficult to.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot enables Mismagius to break specially defensive walls like Steelix, Vaporeon, and Druddigon with its Z-Move. Shadow Ball lets Mismagius threaten Psychic- and Ghost-types like Slowking and Dhelmise with super effective damage. Power Gem provides Mismagius with at worst neutral coverage for most Ghost-resistant and -immune Pokemon such as Incineroar, Guzzlord, and Braviary. Protect lets Mismagius scout Choice item users like Heliolisk, Passimian, and Braviary and narrow down the former three's options thanks to Mismagius's typing and respectable special bulk. When used alongside a Colbur Berry, it also lets Mismagius avoid being Pursuit trapped by Choice Band Sneasel and Choice Scarf Houndoom. Taunt allows Mismagius to set up more reliably against Pokemon like Vaporeon and Miltank that commonly carry Toxic and prevents Mega Audino from recovering health. Taunt also completely shuts down Pyukumuku; however, it leaves Mismagius more vulnerable to Passimian as well as Pursuit trappers. Dazzling Gleam can be used to hit Scrafty for super effective damage and let Mismagius avoid using its Z-Move on Guzzlord, but the utility provided by Taunt and Protect is usually preferred.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature improves Mismagius's offensive presence and lets it outspeed other prominent offensive Pokemon like Magmortar, Rotom, and Delphox. Rockium Z turns Power Gem into Continental Crush and gives Mismagius a reliable way of dealing with Ghost-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Incineroar, Guzzlord, and Braviary. Ghostium Z is an alternative Z-Crystal that lets Mismagius more effectively deal with Pokemon like Rhydon and Silvally-Steel once boosted and nets more damage on neutral targets like Vaporeon, but Rockium Z is preferred due to the coverage Continental Crush provides. If a teammate is already holding a Z-Crystal, a Colbur Berry is a fine item choice to avoid being Pursuit trapped by Choice Band Sneasel. However, this is best used alongside Protect so that Mismagius can see whether Sneasel will use Knock Off or Pursuit. Levitate is Mismagius's only ability and allows Mismagius to switch into Choice-locked Pokemon like Passimian and Aerodactyl and set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mismagius's poor physical bulk and only average special bulk leave few opportunities for setting up; however, Choice-locked Pokemon like Heliolisk, Passimian, and Accelgor are easy to set up against, while Mismagius can also exploit weaker special attackers like Seismitoad and Weezing. Early-game, it is best to just use Shadow Ball and Power Gem to weaken switch-ins to Mismagius, as Mismagius will struggle to sweep through a team that still possesses significant defensive counterplay to it. Mismagius should make sure to Taunt Pokemon like Vaporeon, defensive Slowking, and Mega Audino before setting up, as a Toxic from them makes a sweep much less likely. Taunt also prevents Vaporeon and Mega Audino from recovering health with Wish, and it prevents Defoggers like Silvally-Steel and Golbat from removing entry hazards. This, combined with Mismagius's ability to spinblock and threaten other common forms of hazard control in Xatu, Rotom, and Decidueye, makes Mismagius effective at keeping hazards on the field. If using Protect, scout Choice item users like Passimian and Heliolisk to see what move they will lock themselves into. You can also scout Choice-locked Pursuit trappers like Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Houndoom to find out whether or not they will use Pursuit. It is important to not use Mismagius's Z-Move unless necessary, as it is Mismagius's best way of dealing with special walls like Mega Audino and Incineroar that don't mind Shadow Ball. However, when faced with offensive teams that lack a solid switch-in to Mismagius, its Z-Move can be used to help wallbreak.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mismagius fits best on offensive builds that can assist it by softening its checks and providing utility options to make setting up less difficult. Dual screens support from Pokemon such as Xatu provides Mismagius with safer opportunities to set up with Nasty Plot. Additionally, Xatu can prevent the foe from laying entry hazards of their own and provide U-turn support. Wallbreakers like Sneasel, Choice Specs Heliolisk, Choice Band Passimian, and Decidueye assist Mismagius by taking on special walls such as Slowking, Torterra, and Vaporeon for it. Slow pivoting from the likes of Incineroar and Vikavolt is helpful in ensuring Mismagius gets into battle safely. Incineroar can also handle opposing Dark-types well, while Vikavolt helps weaken specially defensive Pokemon like Silvally-Steel and Cryogonal. Steelix and Torterra are both solid Stealth Rock setters to pair alongside Mismagius because they lure Xatu in for Mismagius. Rhydon also works well with Mismagius, as it can manage Incineroar for unboosted Mismagius. Spikes from Garbodor and Ferroseed pair well with Mismagius; two switches into one layer of Spikes guarantees the OHKO on Guzzlord with +2 Continental Crush. Furthermore, Toxic Spikes support from Garbodor works well if Mismagius is carrying Protect, since it helps Mismagius chip foes. Pokemon such as Calm Mind Comfey work well alongside Mismagius, since they can take advantage of Passimian that are Choice-locked into Knock Off by setting up. Additionally, they can manage Dark-types well for Mismagius.</p>"

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Abomasnow's great Attack and Special Attack stats and powerful STAB attacks in Blizzard and Wood Hammer alongside coverage moves like Focus Blast and Earthquake make it an effective wallbreaker. Mega Abomasnow also enjoys switching into common walls in the tier like certain variants of Xatu, Vaporeon, and Seismitoad. Soundproof prior to Mega Evolution also helps the matchup against the likes of Heliolisk and Vikavolt by giving an immunity to what would otherwise be highly damaging STAB moves. However, a poor Speed stat and a vulnerability to entry hazard damage make it rather easy to wear down and revenge kill. Even Xatu and the Water-types it can supposedly switch into threaten it in one way or another, be it Toxic from Xatu or Vaporeon or Fire-type coverage from Slowking. Lastly, it faces competition with other breakers like Alolan Exeggutor and Mega Glalie that are overall faster and more powerful.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wood Hammer is an option over Giga Drain on the mixed attacker set for a better matchup against Assault Vest Slowking. However, the power difference isn't that big, and Giga Drain gives Mega Abomasnow some extra longevity, while Wood Hammer does quite the opposite.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar can eat Mega Abomasnow's STAB combination for breakfast, though the former doesn't appreciate a Focus Blast, and the latter two don't tank Earthquake well enough. Houndoom doesn't appreciate stomaching a Blizzard or two, but it can still switch in and revenge KO Mega Abomasnow if need be.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Silvally-Steel, Alolan Sandslash, and Togedemaru can tank Mega Abomasnow's STAB combination very well, though coverage moves can be an issue for them. Klinklang plays more of an offensive role, but it forces Mega Abomasnow out and can use that as an opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock and pretty much any entry hazard really hurts Mega Abomasnow. Toxic can also be deadly, especially when most Pokemon that use it, such as Vaporeon and Xatu, often pack Protect alongside it. Lastly, Scald burns from Slowking and Vaporeon can be frustrating even for mixed variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Mega Abomasnow's bulk, although good, isn't anything extraordinary and still plagued by a plethora of weaknesses. That means countless faster Pokemon like Incineroar, Passimian, Braviary, and Medicham pose a massive threat to Mega Abomasnow. With correct pivoting, it isn't too hard for them to come in either.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Mega Abomasnow's go-to choice for an attacking move, as it has plenty of power and perfect accuracy under hail. Giga Drain is the preferred option for mixed sets, as it gives Mega Abomasnow some valuable longevity, which is important, since Mega Abomasnow is susceptible to residual damage from entry hazards and status conditions. Focus Blast has great coverage alongside Blizzard and hits the likes of Incineroar, Silvally-Steel, and Cryogonal for great damage. Earthquake can be used instead for a harder hit on Delphox and Togedemaru, but it does a lot less damage to the three aforementioned Focus Blast targets. Substitute helps Mega Abomasnow avoid revenge killing from Pokemon such as Passimian and Aerodactyl and eases prediction. Alternatively, Ice Shard mitigates Mega Abomasnow's measly Speed and can be helpful to pick off the likes of weakened Braviary and Heliolisk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Soundproof is the preferred ability before Mega Evolution, as it lets Abomasnow switch into Heliolisk and Vikavolt. It also means Mega Abomasnow gets to summon hail instead of its regular counterpart, which gives more hail turns and also means teammates won't take unnecessary hail damage. Maximum Special Attack investment with a boosting nature is preferred to boost the power of its STAB moves. Maximum Speed investment lets Mega Abomasnow outspeed pivot Incineroar. A Mild nature should be picked over Rash, as Mega Abomasnow is much more likely to be tanking special hits, such as Heliolisk's Thunderbolt and Seismitoad or Vaporeon's Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Abomasnow should come into walls it doesn't mind, such as Xatu and Vaporeon; however, it should scout for Toxic from them. Xatu and Vaporeon also often pack Protect, which mandates being careful with PP and is yet another reason Toxic should be feared. Blizzard is generally low risk and should be used frequently early-game, as most of Mega Abomasnow's checks lack reliable recovery. Incineroar and Delphox are also vulnerable to entry hazards, so they can't afford to switch into Blizzard too often when hazards are up. Checks like Incineroar, Delphox, and Silvally-Steel are likely to switch in, so if your team struggles to get up hazards against your opponent's or they have some sort of Wish support, it might be worthwhile to predict their switch-ins and go for Mega Abomasnow's coverage moves. Make sure to pressure hazard setters with Mega Abomasnow and attempt to keep it healthy via Giga Drain, as hazards harm Mega Abomasnow's ability to switch in. Finally, a point important to keep in mind is whether or not to Mega Evolve; for example, if your opponent has a Heliolisk or a Vikavolt, it might be smart to keep Abomasnow at its regular forme to handle those, and the same applies to the likes of Dhelmise, which Abomasnow will only outspeed prior to Mega Evolution.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xatu prevents entry hazards from going up and provides U-turn support for Mega Abomasnow. Likewise, Defoggers like Rotom and Silvally-Steel are plausible picks as well. They also can bring Mega Abomasnow in safely via Volt Switch and Parting Shot, respectively. Faster teammates that appreciate Mega Abomasnow's wallbreaking efforts such as Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Passimian are great allies, and they also make up for Mega Abomasnow's lackluster Speed and provide VoltTurn support. Cleaners like Comfey are also notable for similar reasons. Hazard setters are also important teammates, especially those that can get hazards up against a plenitude of Defoggers and Xatu, such as Rhydon, Curse Steelix, and Piloswine. Lastly, Vaporeon is a very valuable teammate, as it provides Wish and Heal Bell support while covering many foes that threaten Mega Abomasnow, such as Passimian and Fire-types. Delphox and Slowking also help in a similar vein, as both check the aforementioned Passimian and Fire-types, whereas the former can also provide Wish support.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance gives Mega Abomasnow a very useful power boost, making Wood Hammer remarkably hard to switch into. Wood Hammer is the preferred Grass-type STAB attack, as it hits the hardest out of any Grass-type STAB moves Mega Abomasnow has in its arsenal. Ice Shard also becomes a lot more useful after a Swords Dance boost, letting it pick off weakened offensive teams, prevent frail Pokemon such as Heliolisk and Accelgor from revenge killing Mega Abomasnow, and hit the likes of Sceptile and Braviary hard courtesy of their weakness to Ice. Lastly, Earthquake is Mega Abomasnow's best bet against Incineroar, Delphox, and Silvally-Steel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Soundproof helps Mega Abomasnow handle Heliolisk and Vikavolt before Mega Evolution, whereas Snow Warning is Mega Abomasnow's only ability after Mega Evolution and can spread chip damage. Maximum Attack and Speed investment amplifies Mega Abomasnow's firepower and quickness. A Jolly nature is ideal to outrun Vaporeon; however, Adamant can be used for extra power, which is especially important to pick up the OHKO on Heliolisk with +2 Ice Shard after Stealth Rock and always 2HKO offensive Incineroar with Earthquake at -1.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can either break through bulkier teams or pick off weakened offensive ones, so make sure to identify what role it should play. Pokemon packing Protect like Vaporeon and Xatu will often use the move in front of Mega Abomasnow, so if you know they have the move and they don't know what Mega Abomasnow set you are, it could be really helpful to Swords Dance while they use Protect. There's also not too much room to punish this move even if they don't, as both the aforementioned Pokemon are forced out. Try catching the likes of Delphox, Silvally-Steel, and Incineroar with an Earthquake, as they'll likely switch into Mega Abomasnow. You can also lure and take out Hariyama, as it switches into mixed sets just fine but gets throttled by a +2 Wood Hammer. Switching into Water-types like Vaporeon and Slowking may seem like a good plan, but be very mindful of a potential Scald burn, as well as Fire-type coverage from the latter. Make sure to Mega Evolve when the time is right, as if your opponent has a Heliolisk or a Vikavolt, it can be helpful to preserve regular Abomasnow's Soundproof ability. Likewise, outspeeding the likes of Golbat and Garbodor could be helpful prior to Mega Evolution, so keep that in mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xatu provides essential entry hazard control, but Defoggers like Rotom and Silvally-Steel are just as reasonable. Note that all three can also bring Mega Abomasnow in via their respective pivoting moves. Fast teammates like Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Passimian make up for Mega Abomasnow's lack of speed and appreciate it punching holes in the opposing team for them to clean up late-game. Vaporeon is a great teammate, as it handles most Pokemon that switch into Mega Abomasnow and can pass Wishes to it and provide cleric support. Teammates such as Swords Dance Samurott, Swords Dance Absol, and Accelgor can weaken Passimian to get it in range of a boosted Ice Shard. Lastly, reliable Stealth Rock setters, such as Rhydon, Druddigon, and Piloswine, prevent the likes of Incineroar and Delphox from reliably checking Abomasnow. Druddigon also provides speed control with Glare.</p>"

  "Magmortar": {
    "overview": "<p>Magmortar is a fantastic wallbreaker often capable of single-handedly dismantling defensive teams thanks to its great coverage options, its high Special Attack stat, and Taunt. Although Magmortar usually takes advantage of Z-Crystals to lure in and KO Pokemon like Audino and Vaporeon, it can choose to utilize Choice Specs to 2HKO virtually every one of its switch-ins. Magmortar also possesses decent special bulk, which lets it act as a soft check to threatening special attackers like Sceptile, Comfey, and Whimsicott. Unfortunately, Magmortar's poor physical bulk and weakness to entry hazards limit its ability to switch in repeatedly and leave it easily revenge killed by faster attackers like Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Mega Glalie. Additionally, although Magmortar's Speed is fine for matchups against defensive teams, it gives Magmortar a lacking matchup against offensive ones, giving it fewer opportunities to safely wallbreak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flame Charge can be run to improve Magmortar's matchup against offense teams, enabling it to outspeed Choice Scarf Passimian after a boost if running a Timid nature, although Magmortar greatly appreciates Taunt allowing it to more easily defeat Wish users such as Vaporeon, Delphox, and Mega Audino. An Assault Vest set can be used to take advantage of Magmortar's usable special bulk, enabling it to better take on special attacking Grass- and Ice-types such as Sceptile, Whimsicott, and Mega Abomasnow; however, such a set compromises Magmortar's wallbreaking capabilities and gives it a rougher time defeating bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Assault Vest Slowking as well as Audino before Mega Evolving.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gastrodon is the best Magmortar check available, avoiding a 2HKO from even Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast after Stealth Rock while threatening to KO Magmortar with Earthquake after a bit of chip damage. Vaporeon and Assault Vest Slowking are both capable of switching into Fightinium Z variants of Magmortar with ease. However, they must fear Electrium Z and Choice Specs Magmortar, as these two sets can easily 2HKO them.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rhydon can easily take Fire Blast from any Magmortar variant and threaten to KO in return. However, Rhydon must fear Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast as well as All-Out Pummeling. Aerodactyl cannot safely switch in on anything from Magmortar, but it can easily revenge kill Magmortar with Stone Edge or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Magmortar's typing leaves it susceptible to all types of entry hazards, giving it fewer opportunities to switch in and wallbreak throughout a battle.</p> <p><strong>Delphox</strong>: Delphox takes little from any of Magmortar's attacks other than Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt, can recover any health lost with Wish, and threatens to badly poison it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Magmortar's underwhelming Speed, it is easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Mega Glalie, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Sneasel.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Magmortar's strongest attack and hits anything that doesn't resist it for solid damage. Focus Blast enables Magmortar to bypass certain Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Guzzlord more reliably. Thunderbolt covers bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Slowking and hits Delphox for reasonable damage. Taunt gives Magmortar a great matchup against defensive teams, letting it prevent Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Vaporeon from recovering health with Wish. Hidden Power Grass is Magmortar's best way of dealing with Gastrodon and Seismitoad but serves no other purpose.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature improves Magmortar's offensive presence and lets it hit ridiculously hard. Vital Spirit allows Magmortar to switch into Sleep Powder from Vivillon. Fightinium Z gives Magmortar a way to remove Pokemon such as Rhydon without having to risk Focus Blast missing. Alternatively, Electrium Z improves Magmortar's ability to deal with bulky Water-types, notably letting it KO Vaporeon and Assault Vest Slowking with Thunderbolt followed by Gigavolt Havoc.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When trying to bring Magmortar onto the field, look to do so by switching into either resisted special attacks from the likes of Decidueye and Whimsicott or an entry hazard remover like Dhelmise or Silvally-Steel looking to clear hazards. If possible, avoid switching in when entry hazards are on Magmortar's side of the field, as they severely cut into Magmortar's longevity and lessen its ability to soft check special attacking Ice- and Grass-types like Mega Abomasnow and Whimsicott. Magmortar's coverage should always be taken advantage of when given an opportunity to do so; therefore, when predicting a bulky Water-type to switch in, use Thunderbolt, and when predicting a Pokemon such as Audino or Gastrodon to switch in, using Focus Blast is ideal. Additionally, timing Magmortar's Z-Move usage is crucial in ensuring it can safely take out Pokemon such as Incineroar and Vaporeon. Magmortar should also look to use Taunt to prevent Pokemon like Vaporeon and Delphox from recovering health with Wish or crippling it with Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners like Comfey, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Choice Scarf Heliolisk appreciate Magmortar's ability to put immense pressure on the opponent's defensive Pokemon. In addition, Passimian and Heliolisk can easily bring Magmortar in with U-turn and Volt Switch. Although Magmortar can defeat bulky Water-types somewhat reliably, it still appreciates having teammates like Dhelmise and Sceptile that can deal with them as well as take on Gastrodon for it. Dhelmise also provides entry hazard control in the form of Rapid Spin. Entry hazard removal in general from Pokemon like Rotom, Blastoise, and Silvally-Steel is mandatory alongside Magmortar so that it can switch in to wallbreak more often. Rotom and Silvally-Steel also provide pivot support. Conversely, entry hazard support from the likes of Steelix, Rhydon, and Druddigon also pairs extremely well with Magmortar, letting it always 2HKO Vaporeon and Assault Vest Slowking after Stealth Rock, with Druddigon also providing speed control in Glare. Faster Pokemon like Sneasel and Whimsicott are good to pair alongside Magmortar due to its lacking Speed tier, while defensive Pokemon like Dhelmise and Vaporeon can switch into faster threats such as Heliolisk and Aerodactyl for it.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast hits absurdly hard with a Choice Specs boost, notably 2HKOing Mega Audino with Stealth Rock up. Focus Blast targets Fire-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar, Rhydon, Druddigon, and Thick Fat Hariyama. Thunderbolt 2HKOes bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Slowking and is Magmortar's best way of damaging Delphox. Hidden Power Grass targets Seismitoad and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature and Choice Specs maximizes Magmortar's wallbreaking capabilities. Vital Spirit gives Magmortar additional chances to switch in, letting it come in on Sleep Powder from Vivillon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Choice Specs locking Magmortar into whatever move it uses, this set revolves heavily around predicting what your opponent will switch into Magmortar's attacks. For example, when predicting a bulky Water-type like Vaporeon or Assault Vest Slowking to switch in, use Thunderbolt. Since Hidden Power Grass has a very limited pool of targets, it's usually best to simply use Focus Blast to nail Seismitoad and Gastrodon unless the opponent has no other switch-in to Magmortar. Avoid bringing Magmortar in on direct attacks or when entry hazards are present; it is key to preserve Magmortar's health throughout the game so that it has more opportunities to safely wallbreak without fear of being KOed. Instead, bring Magmortar in via pivoting moves like U-turn. Because of how absurdly strong Choice Specs-boosted Fire Blast is, it's generally a safe move to use whenever the opportunity presents itself, such as when Magmortar is against a Grass-type like Whimsicott or Decidueye.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Vivillon, Choice Scarf Heliolisk, and Comfey appreciate Magmortar's ability to tear through dedicated special walls like Assault Vest Slowking and Mega Audino, opening up the door for them to set up and sweep late-game. Heliolisk in particular works well with Magmortar, since it provides pivot support and appreciates Seismitoad being lured in and taken out. Due to Magmortar's underwhelming bulk, it appreciates VoltTurn support from the likes of Passimian and Rotom so that it doesn't have to switch into attacks. Rotom also provides entry hazard control for Magmortar. Furthermore, Magmortar appreciates bulky Pokemon like Berry Rotom and defensive Slowking to switch into faster attackers like Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Passimian for it. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Steelix and Druddigon is beneficial to help Magmortar secure the 2HKO on defensive Delphox with Thunderbolt, while Spikes from Garbodor helps wear down Hariyama. Druddigon can also cripple faster Pokemon for Magmortar with Glare. Entry hazard control is essentially mandatory when using Magmortar, so Pokemon like Xatu and Silvally-Steel are good to pair with it. They can also help bring Magmortar safely onto the field with U-turn and Parting Shot.</p>"

  "Rotom": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom excels as a support Pokemon thanks to its utility movepool and ability to pressure common entry hazard setters such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Seismitoad as well as check wallbreakers like Heliolisk and Braviary. Levitate in particular enables Rotom to be a reliable Defogger, providing it with an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. A potent offensive typing also enables Rotom to effectively pressure common defensive cores with the help of Z-Crystals and Choice Specs without being helpless against checks like Incineroar and Bulk Up Scrafty. Unfortunately, Rotom is incredibly vulnerable to faster Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel and Aerodactyl, with the latter also bypassing a potential Colbur Berry thanks to Unnerve. Additionally, Z-Crystal sets are reliant on their Z-Move to get past checks, making it necessary to predict properly with, while Choice Specs variants can be taken advantage of if locked into a poor move. Lastly, while the defensive set makes Rotom a bit bulkier, its only average defenses combined with its lack of recovery outside of a potential pinch Berry harm its longevity, leaving it unable to switch into attacks too frequently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom can effectively run a Choice Scarf set that functions as a good revenge killer to Pokemon like Delphox and +1 Vivillon, although such a set lacks the offensive prowess and defensive utility Rotom's other sets provide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Guzzlord is Rotom's best check, as it takes little from Rotom's attacks and can OHKO it in return. Incineroar is similar, although offensive variants can struggle to switch into Electrium Z and Choice Specs Rotom. Other Dark-types like Sneasel and Absol can threaten to Pursuit trap Rotom, although they cannot reliably switch in.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Druddigon, Mega Audino, and Ferroseed aren't heavily threatened by Rotom, switching into it with relative ease and setting entry hazards or spreading status. Druddigon and Ferroseed are susceptible to being crippled by Trick, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although they can't safely switch into Rotom, Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Sceptile, and Sigilyph outspeed it and can revenge kill it with little to no issue.</p>",

      "Defensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Given Rotom's decent invested bulk alongside the defensive utility its typing and ability provide, Rotom is a capable Defogger due to it finding multiple opportunities per game to switch in and remove entry hazards. Volt Switch lets Rotom pivot out versus checks like Incineroar, Magmortar, and Scrafty and bring in the appropriate answer. Will-O-Wisp punishes potential Volt Switch answers like Steelix, Druddigon, and Togedemaru while also preventing Pursuit trappers like Sneasel and Aerodactyl from aggressively switching in as easily. Hex synergizes well with Will-O-Wisp and is Rotom's only way to target certain Electric-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Vikavolt and Seismitoad for passable damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Rotom as fast as possible, while 248 HP EVs improve its ability to switch into Pokemon like Heliolisk, Vikavolt, and Accelgor and reduce Stealth Rock damage. Colbur Berry makes Rotom more effective at switching into Passimian and protects it against Pursuit trapping from Sneasel. Alternatively, Iapapa Berry gives Rotom extra longevity, allowing it to function as a more consistent answer to Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Braviary, and Togedemaru. Levitate is Rotom's only ability and helps it better check Pokemon such as Passimian, Rhydon, and Steelix.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Rotom's very usable bulk, it's capable of switching into threats like Heliolisk, Braviary, and Togedemaru multiple times throughout a match. Use these opportunities to remove entry hazards, spread status, or generate momentum with Volt Switch. Volt Switch is generally Rotom's safest move to use; Electric-immune Pokemon are unlikely to switch into Rotom due to the threat of Will-O-Wisp, meaning Rotom should always be able to safely bring in a check versus the opponent's switch-in. If running Colbur Berry, Rotom can be played much more aggressively by staying in versus Pursuit trappers like Sneasel and Absol and burning them with Will-O-Wisp. Unless it's running Iapapa Berry, Rotom's longevity is rather limited. Therefore, be wary of switching Rotom in too frequently, as it will quickly become unable to check Pokemon like Heliolisk and Braviary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom can easily slot itself onto balanced or offensive builds due to the great amount of utility it provides between its defensive traits and utility moves. Although Rotom is a functional check to Flying- and Fighting-type Pokemon, its longevity is poor, and it's very reliant on Colbur Berry to check Fighting-types such as Passimian. Therefore, having secondary checks to such Pokemon like Steelix, Rhydon, Slowking, and Comfey is necessary. Rhydon also provides an Incineroar check, while Comfey can help against other Dark-types like Sneasel and Pangoro. Other pivots such as Passimian and Incineroar pair excellently with Rotom. Passimian appreciates Rotom checking Flying-types and can be brought in against Incineroar, while Incineroar enjoys Rotom threatening bulky Water-types and providing entry hazard control. In return, Passimian threatens faster Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Sceptile that pressure Rotom, while Incineroar can check wallbreakers like Sigilyph and Calm Mind Delphox for Rotom. Pokemon weak to entry hazards like Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Magmortar appreciate Rotom's Defog support as well as its ability to bring them into battle with Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog lets Rotom support its teammates by removing entry hazards and works particularly well on this set given its ability to heavily threaten common hazard setters with great damage. While unreliable on its own, Thunder alongside Electrium Z makes Rotom capable of breaking past Swords Dance Incineroar after Stealth Rock while also threatening Sneasel and Pangoro. If you forgo Electrium Z for Ghostium Z, Thunderbolt should be used instead of Thunder for its reliability against targets such as Slowking and Vaporeon. Shadow Ball is Rotom's most consistent source of damage against Electric-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Dhelmise, Druddigon, and Vikavolt. Volt Switch helps Rotom get certain checks into range of its Z-Move and provides momentum for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Rotom as fast and strong as possible. While Electrium Z improves Rotom's matchup against most Dark-types such as Pangoro, Swords Dance Incineroar, and Sneasel, Ghostium Z helps it get past opposing entry hazard setters like Rhydon, Steelix, Druddigon, and Seismitoad. Levitate is Rotom's only ability and provides it with an immunity to Ground, providing it with more opportunities to switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Timing the usage of Rotom's Z-Move is crucial; without it, Rotom has more difficulty dealing with its checks. If the opponent has an Electric-immune Pokemon, holding back on using Gigavolt Havoc may be preferred; similarly, waiting to use Never-Ending Nightmare until the opponent's switch-in to Ghost-type moves is weakened or removed is ideal. While Rotom's natural bulk isn't fantastic, its defensive typing and ability provide it with solid opportunities to switch in against Pokemon like Passimian, Heliolisk, and Weezing. Use this time to remove entry hazards with Defog or simply fire off attacks to wallbreak. The latter is an especially good choice when looking to get checks like Incineroar and Steelix into range of Rotom's Z-Move. If the opponent has a Pursuit user such as Sneasel or Aerodactyl, they may look to aggressively switch it into Rotom as it uses Defog; take this opportunity to try to remove it with Gigavolt Havoc or pivot out with Volt Switch to the appropriate check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom is generally best fit for balanced and offensive teams due to its proficiency at keeping up offensive momentum while providing such teams with vital defensive utility. Depending on which Z-Crystal Rotom opts for, different teammates are ideal. If Electrium Z is chosen, Pokemon such as Delphox and Sneasel that appreciate Incineroar being removed are excellent partners. In contrast, Pokemon such as Magmortar and Braviary enjoy Ghostium Z Rotom weakening Pokemon such as Druddigon and Steelix. All of these Pokemon also appreciate Defog support. Entry hazard setters such as Rhydon, Garbodor, and Steelix are beneficial, helping put Pokemon such as Incineroar and Druddigon in range of Rotom's Z-Move. In return, Rotom can spinblock and heavily pressures Pokemon with other forms of hazard control like Xatu and Decidueye. Other Pokemon with pivoting moves like Incineroar and Passimian can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom. Incineroar appreciates Rotom dealing with Blastoise, while Passimian enjoys being brought in against Pokemon such as Incineroar and Guzzlord. In return, Incineroar can check certain Pursuit trappers like Sneasel and Absol and pressures Ferroseed, while Passimian can remove Electric-immune Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Rotom's strongest move to hit Incineroar with and threatens bulky Water-types like Slowking and Vaporeon. Shadow Ball targets common switch-ins to Rotom's Electric-type attacks like Rhydon, Steelix, Druddigon, and Alolan Exeggutor. Volt Switch potentially lets Rotom threaten its switch-ins more effectively than it can itself by bringing in the appropriate check to them. Trick enables Rotom to cripple defensive switch-ins like Steelix, Druddigon, and Bulk Up Scrafty. Alternatively, Defog can be used so Rotom can provide further utility to its team, although being locked into it leaves Rotom very vulnerable to setup sweepers and Pursuit trappers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature and Choice Specs makes Rotom very potent offensively, enabling it to 2HKO Swords Dance Incineroar with Thunderbolt. Levitate gives Rotom more opportunities to switch into battle to wallbreak due to the Ground immunity it provides Rotom with.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prediction is key to getting the most out of Rotom; although using Volt Switch repeatedly may seem ideal to get chip damage on checks like Incineroar, giving up momentum to Electric-immune Pokemon such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Togedemaru is not desirable. Instead, look to hit such Pokemon with Shadow Ball or cripple them with Trick to enable Rotom to spam Volt Switch late-game. Although Rotom's bulk isn't the greatest, it still has useful defensive utility between its typing and ability; take advantage of its immunities and resistances by switching into Pokemon like Steelix and Braviary to gain wallbreaking opportunities. If running Defog, it's important to be wary of using it haphazardly. Doing so risks having a Pursuit trapper like Sneasel or Aerodactyl switching in and trapping Rotom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes from Garbodor is great alongside Rotom, chipping checks such as Incineroar and Druddigon in tandem with Volt Switch very effectively. Garbodor also provides a secondary check to Fighting-type Pokemon. In return, Rotom can spinblock for Garbodor. Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon support Rotom by checking Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Absol. Steelix and Rhydon also provide Stealth Rock and enjoy Rotom's ability to deal with Water-types like Slowking and Blastoise and entry hazard removers like Dhelmise and Decidueye. Late-game sweepers like Calm Mind Sigilyph and Comfey appreciate Rotom weakening Pokemon such as Druddigon, Incineroar, and Steelix for them. Passimian pairs great with Rotom; it forms a VoltTurn core alongside Rotom and appreciates Rotom checking Flying-types such as Vivillon for it. In return, Passimian can help remove Rhydon, Steelix, and Seismitoad, opening up the door for Rotom to freely use Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>Mesprit is a very niche Stealth Rock setter with near-perfect coverage to threaten opposing entry hazard removers and Stealth Rock setters, allowing it to act as an offensive support Pokemon. It also has good uninvested bulk and a useful ability that let it find multiple opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Outside of this role, however, Mesprit is horribly outclassed by other Stealth Rock setters such as Druddigon, Rhydon, and Seismitoad because they're far more consistent and have better defensive utility by virtue of their types, bulk, and abilities. Other Psychic-types such as Medicham, Delphox, and Sigilyph also give Mesprit competition, as they are stronger and the latter two have better Speed tiers to make them more threatening. While it sports good bulk, Mesprit's lack of reliable recovery combined with the necessity to run full offensive investment to have any valuable niche makes it susceptible to being worn down quickly. Mesprit also only has average Speed and is outpaced by faster threats such as Rotom, Togedemaru, and Sneasel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf with Healing Wish can patch up Mesprit's speed issues and allows it to support its teammates by giving them a second chance to sweep or wallbreak, but being locked into an undesirable move forces it out much more often, which makes it extremely vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by the likes of Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Absol.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Sneasel can also pressure Mesprit further by Pursuit trapping it but cannot directly switch into Gigavolt Havoc or Thunder. Incineroar can set up in front of Mesprit after it has used its Z-Move but must be cautious if it hasn't. Scrafty is bulky enough to shrug off hits from Mesprit at full health and can heal itself with Rest. Guzzlord resists most of Mesprit's moves but still has to be cautious of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Thanks to Mesprit's only average Speed, it is outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon such as Magmortar, Heliolisk, Whimsicott, Accelgor, and Aerodactyl, but none of them want to directly switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Rotom and Mismagius can outspeed Mesprit and threaten it out with their STAB moves. Rotom can also remove Mesprit's Stealth Rock with Defog. Dhelmise and Decidueye accomplish the same thing but aren't big issues if Mesprit is running Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mesprit is worn down by switching into resisted attacks and Stealth Rock, which shortens the amount of time that it can wallbreak and makes it easier to revenge kill.</p>",

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mesprit makes for a decent offensive Stealth Rock setter thanks to its immense coverage options to threaten opposing Stealth Rock setters and entry hazard removers. Psychic is Mesprit's strongest STAB move, allowing it to deal with Pokemon like Passimian, Garbodor, Golbat, and Weezing. Thunder paired with Electrium Z can power through Pokemon that can give Mesprit trouble such as Incineroar, Xatu, and Blastoise. Thunderbolt is a more reliable option than Thunder and is still a decently powerful move after Mesprit uses its Z-Move. Energy Ball is the preferred fourth move to deal with bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Slowking as well as Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Palossand. Ice Beam is a good option to 2HKO Xatu, which gives Mesprit an easier time setting up Stealth Rock and means it doesn't have to use its Z-Move to beat Xatu. It also threatens other Stealth Rock setters such as Steelix and Druddigon as well as Dhelmise. Calm Mind can make Mesprit a more threatening wallbreaker at the expense of another coverage move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread gives Mesprit as much of an offensive presence as possible, allowing it to outspeed offensive Decidueye and Speed tie with Braviary, Medicham, and Gallade. Electrium Z is used to power through Incineroar, Xatu, and bulky Water-types like Slowking, Blastoise, and Vaporeon, which can give it an easier time setting Stealth Rock. Levitate gives Mesprit an immunity to Ground-type moves and Spikes, which helps increase its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mesprit makes a decent lead option thanks to its good matchup against most Stealth Rock setters. While it should try to set Stealth Rock as soon as it can, Mesprit should aim to use Ice Beam or Thunder if the opponent's team has Xatu, as these moves can 2HKO Xatu and give it an easier time setting Stealth Rock. Try to save Mesprit's Z-Move for a weakened Incineroar or potential entry hazard remover such as Golbat, Xatu, or Blastoise, as the move severely dents all of them and gives Mesprit more opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Be cautious, as Mesprit can only use Gigavolt Havoc once. While Mesprit is by no means frail, it should still be kept as healthy as possible so it can wallbreak later. It can easily come in against Fighting-types like Passimian or predicted Ground-type moves from Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Piloswine, but it must watch out for Passimian's Knock Off and U-turn. After setting Stealth Rock, Mesprit can aim to wallbreak for the rest of the match thanks to its high power and great coverage options. It can even potentially sweep late-game if it is running Calm Mind, but make sure any opposing Dark-types have been dealt with.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Incineroar makes a good partner for Mesprit, as it can bring Mesprit into battle safely with U-turn and threatens Xatu and Slowking to give Mesprit more free reign on what to use its Z-Move against. Mesprit, in turn, can threaten defensive Water-types like Blastoise, Seismitoad, and Vaporeon for Incineroar. Mesprit's ability to threaten most Stealth Rock setters is greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Magmortar, Aerodactyl, and Sneasel. Pokemon such as Passimian, Whimsicott, and Comfey enjoy Mesprit's ability to check Poison-types, while they help check Dark-types in return. Setup sweepers such as Scrafty, Calm Mind Delphox, and Samurott appreciate Mesprit's Stealth Rock support for providing important chip damage as they sweep late-game. Spikes setters like Garbodor and Ferroseed can also form a hazard stacking core with Mesprit, while they love Mesprit's ability to threaten most entry hazard removers from removing their Spikes with its near-perfect coverage. Garbodor also appreciates Mesprit having Levitate to dodge Earthquakes aimed at it.</p>"

  "Samurott": {
    "overview": "<p>Samurott is one of the best offensive Water-types in the NU tier. Thanks to its balanced attacking stats, it can effectively run physical, special, and mixed sets. Having access to near-perfect coverage with moves like Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Grass Knot, it rarely finds itself hard walled by any Pokemon. It also has access to Swords Dance and Aqua Jet, allowing it to perform as a sweeper, as well as another utility move in Taunt, which can give it the opportunity to break through Pokemon like Vaporeon and defensive Slowking by preventing them from recovering. It can also prevent status moves from the likes of Mega Audino and Stealth Rock from Pokemon like Druddigon. Samurott has quite a few checks, however, such as Heliolisk and Vaporeon, both of which tank Water-type moves with ease, preventing Samurott from spamming Hydro Pump and Liquidation. Heliolisk works especially well against Samurott, as it is faster and puts a stop to both the special and Swords Dance sets. Samurott is further hindered by its mediocre Speed, meaning you'll have to keep it healthy so it can set up and sweep. This also makes it easy to revenge kill with Pokemon that are resistant to Aqua Jet, such as Sceptile and Whimsicott.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed Choice Scarf set can be viable with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Grass Knot, and Superpower. Use this if your team lacks a way to check faster foes, although the fact that Samurott cannot switch moves and doesn't have any sort of item power boost means it may come up short. Superpower is run to surprise Heliolisk with an OHKO so Samurott can consistently spam Hydro Pump. Life Orb can be run on the Swords Dance set to give a slight damage boost if you already have a Z-Move holder. Superpower is an option on both sets, as it helps Samurott deal with Heliolisk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heliolisk</strong>: Heliolisk, regardless of whether Samurott is physical or special, is a good blanket check to Samurott. Immune to its Water-type attacks due to Dry Skin, Heliolisk prevents Samurott from spamming its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Seismitoad, Pyukumuku, and Vaporeon are all problems for Samurott in some way. Blastoise has the ability to burn Samurott with Scald and potentially stall it out with Toxic, Seismitoad can completely block its Water-type moves, Pyukumuku completely invalidates both the physical and special sets due to Unaware and its lightness and low Base Power on Grass Knot, and Vaporeon is a general annoyance if Samurott is not running Taunt due to Toxic and Wish.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott give Samurott trouble, as they are resistant to Aqua Jet, preventing Samurott from pulling off an effective sweep or clean until they are severely weakened. However, they are manageable thanks to Samurott's access to Megahorn and Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls like Mega Audino and Type: Null can prove heavily harmful to special Samurott depending on its last move, as they can easily tank hits. While they are susceptible to Taunt and Knock Off, respectively, they will definitely prove difficult for special Samurott to deal with.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump gives Samurott a powerful STAB move that can easily break through Pokemon that don't resist it. Grass Knot is its main coverage move, allowing Samurott to hit Water-resistant foes like Seismitoad and Slowking for more damage. Ice Beam provides additional coverage and consistent damage and is Samurott's main attack to hit the potent Heliolisk as well as various Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott. Taunt can be run to prevent status and stop entry hazards from going up, effectively allowing Samurott to stay healthy longer. Another reason as to why Taunt is useful is to allow Samurott to beat Vaporeon one-on-one. Knock Off is an option over Taunt to remove items like Assault Vest on Slowking and Leftovers on Vaporeon. Aqua Jet can also be used over Taunt to give Samurott some kind of priority against faster Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Delphox. However, it is a bit weaker due to the lack of Attack investment. Finally, Surf can be run over Hydro Pump for a more consistent Water-type STAB move. However, it does worsen most matchups, as the power Hydro Pump gives off is irreplaceable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs along with a Timid nature are run to make Samurott as fast and as powerful as possible. Life Orb effectively makes its attacks more powerful. Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb to deal decent damage with super effective hits while not taking recoil. Torrent is used to boost Samurott’s Water-type moves if it gets below 1/3rd of its HP. This can let Samurott pull off a clutch sweep with Aqua Jet.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to play around Heliolisk effectively. It is Samurott's best counter, as it can be healed up by Water-type attacks. Try to avoid spamming Hydro Pump and Surf before Heliolisk and other Water-immune Pokemon like Seismitoad, which is susceptible to Grass Knot, are taken out. Instead, try using Ice Beam to catch Heliolisk on the switch. Try to take out all special walls such as Mega Audino and Assault Vest Slowking before spamming moves with Samurott, as taking Life Orb damage just for the foe to soak up a hit and heal right up is not ideal. Thankfully, Samurott can prevent this in many ways, such as using Taunt on Audino to prevent Wish. Knock Off can also hit Assault Vest users such as Hariyama and Slowking, allowing Samurott to muscle through them more easily. Be sure to Taunt Pokemon like Druddigon and Vaporeon to prevent entry hazards and status moves like Toxic. Vaporeon is also shut down by Taunt, as it prevents it from using Wish, effectively letting Samurott beat it one-on-one. Due to Samurott's low Speed stat, it's advised to send it in on Pokemon that are slower than it, like Steelix and Rhydon. This will allow it to get as much damage off as it can while taking less damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical wallbreakers such as Incineroar and Medicham are great partners for Samurott, as they help break through special walls like Mega Audino and Cryogonal. Electric-types like Heliolisk also help Samurott, as they deal with the Water-types Samurott struggles with such as Vaporeon and Assault Vest Slowking. Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Decidueye and Dhelmise also make for good partners, as they can effectively deal with Samurott's biggest counter, Heliolisk. Grass-resistant Pokemon like Delphox and Incineroar can help weaken and even eliminate Grass-types such as Sceptile and Whimsicott, which resist Aqua Jet. Samurott can support physical Choice Scarf users such as Braviary and Passimian, as Samurott eliminates their checks. The same logic can also be applied to late-game sweepers like Comfey, as Samurott helps weaken its checks as well.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance gives Samurott the ability to break or sweep through teams effectively. Liquidation is the most powerful physical STAB move it has access to, allowing it to have consistent damage output throughout the match. Waterfall can be run over Liquidation for the flinch chance, although the extra power from Liquidation is nice to have. Aqua Jet is used for priority and helps with Samurott's low Speed stat. However, it can also make Samurott a potent revenge killer, being able to potentially OHKO Aerodactyl and Delphox. Lastly, Megahorn targets some of Samurott's easiest switch-ins such as Heliolisk and Slowking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Samurott to be both as fast and as powerful as it can. Buginium Z is usually run to give Samurott the ability to OHKO Slowking with a +2 Attack boost, but Waterium Z can be run as well for a consistent STAB Z-Move if you so wish. Lum Berry is also something to consider, as it can let Samurott easily beat Vaporeon one-on-one. Besides those three items, Rindo Berry and Wacan Berry are both options as well if Samurott is needed to take a Grass- or Electric-type hit. For example, it may be useful to take a Thunderbolt from Heliolisk if you need to hit it with a Megahorn. Torrent is used so Samurott's Water-type moves, specifically Aqua Jet, can do more at less than a third of its HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless there is a clear opportunity early on, Samurott shouldn't try to sweep until late-game. Samurott will be better off if it waits until most Pokemon are chipped down to sweep. However, if there is an opportunity for Samurott to set up a Swords Dance and wallbreak, you should take that opportunity. A Swords Dance-boosted Liquidation is sure to do a ton of damage to anything that doesn't resist Water, and the foes that do resist it like Slowking and Vaporeon are susceptible to Megahorn. Keep Samurott away from status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Incineroar and Toxic from Vaporeon, as they will ruin any chance Samurott had to sweep. If at all possible, try to get Samurott into Torrent range to maximize the power of its Water-type moves, specifically Aqua Jet, to help it sweep. Aqua Jet should be used to clean late-game to hit faster Pokemon that can KO Samurott. It can also be used throughout the match to simply KO weakened Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Consistent Heliolisk answers such as Decidueye and Togedemaru should be paired with Samurott, as they help eliminate one of its biggest threats. They can soak up Electric- and Normal-type STAB moves and almost always take every other coverage move with the exception of the rare Dark Pulse for Decidueye and Focus Blast in Togedemaru's case. Pokemon that deal with physical walls, such as Heliolisk and Alolan Exeggutor, are welcomed. Not only do they easily eliminate some of Samurott's biggest checks, but they also help chip down the opposing team in general, making it easier for Samurott to sweep late-game. Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Incineroar and Magmortar are helpful, as they can come in on some of Samurott's best checks like Sceptile and Whimsicott and use their Fire-type moves. Incineroar and Silvally-Steel are particularly good picks, as they can pivot around using U-turn or Parting Shot. Xatu can make a great partner for Samurott, as it can bounce back entry hazards and status, both of which can be detrimental to Samurott. Spikes and Toxic Spikes users such as Ferroseed and Garbodor can help chip down some of Samurott's bulkier checks like Seismitoad and Torterra, making it easier for Samurott to sweep late-game. Pokemon like Comfey and Heliolisk that enjoy the presence of a physical wallbreaker are great partners for Samurott, as it assists them in being able to clean or sweep.</p>"

  "Audino": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to high defensive stats and a workable defensive typing, Mega Audino is one of NU's premier walls, able to take on a large variety of the tier's attackers. An excellent ability pre-Mega Evolution also allows Audino to easily keep itself healthy without needing to use a turn healing itself, helping it to reduce lost momentum. This combined with its Normal typing is usually enough to wall most of NU's special attackers, only requiring Audino to Mega Evolve if the resistances and extra bulk the Mega Evolution brings are needed. Mega Audino also has access to an extremely wide support movepool, including many options such as Heal Bell, Wish, and Encore, as well as a wide offensive movepool, giving it exceptional coverage. However, very lackluster offensive stats, especially before Mega Evolving, force Mega Audino to rely on Toxic to deal damage, or otherwise it can be fairly passive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Trick Room supporter set with Trick Room, Encore, and Healing Wish allows Audino to gain momentum for a Trick Room team and restore their wallbreakers to full HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Because Knock Off doesn't threaten them heavily, Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing are easily able to come in on Mega Audino and force it out, with Garbodor and Weezing also being able to capitalize on most of its sets' passivity through Toxic Spikes. Golbat can easily switch into Mega Audino, although it doesn't appreciate having its Eviolite removed.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang resist Dazzling Gleam, only fear Fire Blast, and easily force Mega Audino out with the threat of their STAB moves and, in Klinklang's case, the threat of setting up. Silvally-Steel cannot threaten Mega Audino much outside of Toxic; however, it can use Mega Audino to easily Defog against its team, forces Audino to waste Heal Bell PP, and takes little damage from Dazzling Gleam or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mega Audino is generally extremely passive outside of Toxic, so enemy setup sweepers such as Klinklang, Torterra, Incineroar, Vivillon, and Braviary can easily boost up against it and use the boosts to break through its admittedly impressive defenses.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish allows Mega Audino to support its team by keeping their HP up while also healing itself, and Protect prevents Mega Audino from being damaged on the turn that Wish heals it. Protect also allows Mega Audino to scout what move a Choiced foe will lock itself into while reducing the damage of any Z-Moves, such as an All-Out Pummeling from Scrafty. Toxic allows Mega Audino to easily wear down many unboosted attackers in NU, especially combined with Protect. Heal Bell allows Mega Audino to keep its team status free while preventing itself from being worn down by Toxic. Knock Off allows Mega Audino to remove a foe's item, weakening Choiced attackers such as Alolan Exeggutor and Vikavolt and removing items from defensive walls such as Steelix, Golbat and Vaporeon, allowing them to be worn down more easily. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam lets Mega Audino deal with Guzzlord and prevents it from being setup fodder for Scrafty.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment allows Mega Audino to maximize the healing of its Wishes while also increasing its overall bulk. Maximum Special Defense investment and a Calm nature allow Mega Audino to wall many of NU's special attackers, taking 42% maximum from strong attacks such as Sceptile's Life Orb-boosted Leaf Storm once Mega-Evolved and avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Specs Guzzlord's Sludge Wave. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 208 Def / 48 SpA with a Bold nature and Dazzling Gleam as Mega Audino's attacking move allows it to take on physical attackers such as Passimian, Aerodactyl, Scrafty, and Sneasel much more reliably.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Regenerator should be used to allow Audino to scout which moves dangerous enemy Choiced special attackers such as Heliolisk lock themselves into, as this heavily reduces the risk of a wrong prediction. Afterwards, the user can choose to pivot Audino out again if the foe deals significant damage to it. Thus, Audino should try to avoid Mega Evolving until it needs the additional Fairy typing, for example against Guzzlord or Scrafty. Audino should generally be brought into enemy special attackers such as Guzzlord, Vikavolt, and Magmortar to use its incredible special bulk to keep its team healthy, as well as using Wish to heal up its teammates and Heal Bell when needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its unique ability to check Heliolisk, mixed Mega Abomasnow, Vikavolt, and Choice Specs Whimsicott reliably, Mega Audino can provide excellent role compression to many balance and stall teams in NU. Pokemon that appreciate Wish support such as Steelix, Rhydon, Silvally-Steel, and Hariyama are often great partners to this set, as it can patch up one of their major weaknesses. Seismitoad is a fantastic partner that can comfortably check Steel-types and most Fire-types for Audino as well as set up Stealth Rock. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Audino's ability to check many of the tier's Dark-types such as Rotom and Xatu can make great partners, with Xatu in particular also helping Mega Audino out by checking enemy Steelix and Garbodor and keeping entry hazards away. In general, entry hazard control from Silvally-Steel, Xatu, and Rotom greatly helps Mega Audino out, as otherwise it cannot take advantage of Regenerator to its fullest. If you're using Knock Off, Pokemon that appreciate Steelix having its Leftovers removed such as Klinklang and Braviary can make great partners. If you're using Toxic, Pokemon that appreciate Slowking, Vaporeon, and Cryogonal worn down such as Incineroar, Delphox, and Sneasel are great options. Thanks to Mega Audino's weakness to enemy Poison-types, Pokemon such as Rhydon, Klinklang, and Steelix that can take on the likes of Garbodor are excellent partners. Mega Audino also functions excellently on stall teams, with Pokemon such as Pyukumuku mitigating its weakness to enemy setup sweepers and Pokemon such as Cryogonal removing hazards for it and preventing it from being worn down by repeated switches into enemy Heliolisk. Clerics such as Vaporeon can also help Mega Audino, as if not using Heal Bell itself, it is quite vulnerable to Toxic poison. If using Heal Bell itself, Mega Audino can easily support teammates that are weak to Toxic such as Cryogonal while also supporting any teammates using Rest such as Pyukumuku.</p>"

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad provides a lot of utility for teams that appreciate its ability to set up Stealth Rock and provide a useful Water and Electric immunity. Additionally, its bulk and typing let it check Pokemon like Incineroar, Garbodor, and Aerodactyl and beat opposing entry hazard setters like Rhydon and Steelix. Furthermore, Seismitoad has good flexibility with its sets; it can bypass Xatu with Waterium Z-boosted Hydro Pump, or it can utilize a Substitute + Toxic set to deal with Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon and Dhelmise. However, Seismitoad's longevity can be an issue, as its bulk isn't great, and it's only source of recovery is Leftovers, which makes it vulnerable to Incineroar's Knock Off. Seismitoad is also extremely vulnerable to Grass-types and Grass-type coverage from the likes of Delphox, forcing it to switch out and give up momentum against such threats. Additionally, Seismitoad must run a defensive set to reliably switch into threats like Incineroar and Aerodactyl, whose power enables them to easily break non-defensive sets, which leaves it almost hopeless against Xatu.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is an option to cripple and remove items from item-reliant Pokemon like Golbat, Slowking, and opposing Seismitoad. A physically offensive variant of Seismitoad with Stealth Rock is an option to take advantage of its greater Attack stat with coverage options such as Ice Punch and Knock Off. However, Seismitoad lacks a physical Water-type STAB move, meaning it has to rely on its secondary STAB moves and coverage options to break through Ground-types like Palossand and Rhydon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type coverage</strong>: Seismitoad's typing only leaves it with a 4x weakness to Grass, which can leave it open to getting KOed by any Grass coverage. Pokemon such as Samurott and Delphox are common users of Grass Knot, restricting its ability to pivot into them safely. Similarly, Seismitoad invites almost every Grass-type in the tier like Alolan Exeggutor and Dhelmise for free, giving them an opportunity to remove the Stealth Rock it sets or fire off a strong attack.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Seismitoad is unable to safely pivot into threats like Heliolisk and Vikavolt safely due to their extremely high Special Attack, allowing both to 2HKO it, and the latter even commonly carries Energy Ball to remove it. Seismitoad can only safely switch into Heliolisk when it is not Choice locked into Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers like Substitute Braviary, Comfey, and Mismagius are capable of using Seismitoad as setup fodder due to its passivity preventing it from being able to threaten and force them out; however, Seismitoad can put them on a timer with Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismitoad is a decent Stealth Rock user by virtue of its natural bulk and ability to pressure other entry hazard setters in the tier such as Steelix, Garbodor, and Palossand. Scald is the Water-type STAB move of choice due to its decent chance to burn the foe, which can be detrimental to a lot of Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Druddigon. Refresh allows Seismitoad to cure itself of status ailments such as Toxic, which helps improve its longevity. It also allows Seismitoad to pivot into Pokemon like Blastoise and Vaporeon knowing it can stall them out of Toxic PP while absorbing their Water-type STAB moves. Earthquake hits threats like Delphox, Heliolisk, and defensive Garbodor significantly harder than Earth Power would, notably being strong enough to KO Heliolisk. Alternatively, Toxic gives Seismitoad the ability to cripple Pokemon like Slowking, Alolan Exeggutor, and Vaporeon, which fear very little from Seismitoad's STAB moves and don't care about being burned that much, and the latter is immune to Scald due to Water Absorb.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Seismitoad to outpace Incineroar and Xatu. The rest of the EVs are invested into physical bulk to allow Seismitoad to check Pokemon like Incineroar and Aerodactyl better. Leftovers gives Seismitoad the passive recovery it requires to consistently keep pivoting into these threats. Water Absorb provides Seismitoad with an immunity to Water-type coverage from Pokemon like Blastoise and Vaporeon to potentially provide Seismitoad with another way to recover its health when hit by said coverage. An EV spread of 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 Spe with a Bold nature can be run to give Seismitoad more defensive capabilities that can allow it to pivot into Pokemon like Aerodactyl more easily. The 40 Speed EVs allow Seismitoad to outspeed defensive Garbodor and 2HKO it with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Seismitoad should aim to switch into Pokemon it can check and force out like Steelix, Palossand, and Togedemaru, securing a free opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Seismitoad can use its ability Water Absorb and Refresh to pivot into Pokemon like Vaporeon and defensive Slowking to regain health and potentially put them on a timer with Toxic. You should look to remove Seismitoad's status immediately to prevent it from being worn down too much, especially if it can't find a free opportunity to do so later on. While Seismitoad has a good set of resistances and immunities, it should not switch into some threats like Samurott and Delphox too liberally, as they can easily threaten it with strong or super effective coverage options; they are notably effective users of Grass Knot. Similarly, Seismitoad invites Grass-types like Whimsicott and Sceptile and can only put them on a timer with Toxic before being forced out. However, Seismitoad can limit their switches with Toxic damage in conjunction with Stealth Rock chip damage, especially if utilizing Protect to get more Toxic damage off. Seismitoad is reliant on Leftovers for passive recovery, so it should avoid switching into strong physical attackers like Incineroar and Rhydon too liberally.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types like Incineroar, Magmortar, and Delphox work well with Seismitoad thanks to their ability to pressure Grass-types. Incineroar is able to lure in many of its checks like Rhydon and Aerodactyl to potentially pivot out with U-turn and give Seismitoad the free turn to pressure them and set up Stealth Rock. Delphox appreciates these checks being removed too and is able to provide Wish support, which is fantastic due to Seismitoad's reliance on Leftovers. Aerodactyl is another great partner that can threaten the abundance of Grass-types in the tier while also providing a secondary check to Fire-types, which takes some pressure off Seismitoad. In return, Seismitoad is able to take the Water coverage aimed at Aerodactyl and check the bulky Ground-types that Aerodactyl struggles to break. Pursuit users such as Sneasel and the aforementioned Aerodactyl can trap and remove Xatu while also threatening it with their STAB coverage, which gives Seismitoad an easier time to set up Stealth Rock. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Rotom, Dhelmise, and Decidueye works well to prevent Seismitoad from getting worn down easily. These Pokemon can also pressure the bulky Water-types that Seismitoad struggles with such as Slowking, Blastoise, and opposing Seismitoad and are capable of acting as effective spinblockers. Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing work well with Seismitoad by pressuring Grass-types like Whimsicott, Sceptile, and Dhelmise; additionally, both can act as Toxic absorbers for Seismitoad, and Garbodor is also able to absorb Toxic Spikes, which prevents Seismitoad from having to use Refresh immediately and draining momentum.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismitoad has an easier time setting up Stealth Rock, as it effectively threatens opposing entry hazard setters and forms of entry hazard control like Rhydon, Steelix, Xatu, and Rotom. Hydro Pump hits Pokemon like Rotom, Weezing, and Incineroar for heavy damage and weakens your opponent's team significantly if unresisted. Hydro Pump, when boosted by Waterium Z, OHKOes Xatu. Earth Power hits Pokemon like Blastoise, Druddigon, and Heliolisk that resist or are immune to Hydro Pump. Knock Off mainly makes Pokemon like Golbat and Blastoise easier to wear down, removing their Eviolite and Leftovers. Toxic is another viable fourth move, allowing Seismitoad to cripple metagame staples like Slowking, Comfey, Vaporeon, and Dhelmise. Sludge Bomb can also be used over Knock Off, as it lets Seismitoad OHKO Whimsicott and 2HKO Grass-types like Alolan Exeggutor and Sceptile while potentially crippling common switch-ins like Slowking and Decidueye. However, it is not as consistently useful as Knock Off or Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Speed and Special Attack with a Modest nature give Seismitoad the most firepower it can get while still outspeeding a key target in Incineroar. Waterium Z enables Seismitoad to get past entry hazard control like Xatu and Rotom by OHKOing said targets with Hydro Vortex and gives it a safe option if you don't want to worry about missing Hydro Pump. Hydro Vortex also often catches Pokemon like Weezing and Pangoro off guard thinking they can set up relatively safely. Water Absorb gives Seismitoad a Water immunity, making it a relatively safe switch-in to Water-types like Blastoise and Vaporeon and helping it check Heliolisk better. Although, players must be wary of Toxic from the aforementioned Water-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This particular set is best used as a lead and is able to scare out a number of Pokemon. Use Seismitoad's offensive presence to force out opposing Pokemon and gain an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, preferably as soon as possible. With Waterium Z, Seismitoad threatens common leads, often Stealth Rock users like Rhydon, Steelix, and Palossand. Predicting an incoming Golbat and going for Knock Off, thus removing its Eviolite, offers great utility for your team. In the same vein, removing an incoming Whimsicott's Choice Specs greatly reduces its damage output. This set doesn't have the bulk to take a lot of hits. Keep this in mind when switching in, even against resisted moves like Delphox's Fire Blast and Aerodactyl's Stone Edge. Try to time the usage of Hydro Vortex correctly. It has good surprise value and works best on Pokemon with uninvested special bulk like Weezing, Xatu, and Vikavolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other entry hazard setters like Garbodor and Ferroseed appreciate Seismitoad's ability to remove entry hazard control and checks to these Pokemon like Xatu and Rotom. Garbodor in particular forms a good entry hazard core with Seismitoad. Garbodor takes care of Grass-types, while Seismitoad gets rid of Ground-types. Seismitoad can pave the way for physically offensive Pokemon like Passimian and Togedemaru by removing checks like Weezing and Vikavolt with a potent Hydro Vortex. In return, Togedemaru helps Seismitoad deal with Rock-types and is also an answer to Flying-types, which makes up for Seismitoad's lack of a Flying resistance. Flying-types like Aerodactyl, Sigilyph, and Vivillon take care of Grass-types hindering Seismitoad. Seismitoad offers itself as a Rock-resistant and Electric-immune teammate in exchange.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Toxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute provides Seismitoad with a lot more opportunities to use Toxic on faster threats like Sceptile and Decidueye without fearing being KOed in the process. Additionally, Substitute allows Seismitoad to avoid being statused by Toxic from foes such as Vaporeon and Blastoise. Toxic allows Seismitoad to wear down an opposing Pokemon and cripple threats such as Decidueye and Alolan Exeggutor that it otherwise is unable to effectively punish. Scald allows Seismitoad to punish users it can't touch with Toxic, such as Weezing and Golbat; however, it can be counterproductive if it inflicts a burn on an unwanted target like Sceptile, preventing Seismitoad from being able to use Toxic on it. Earthquake allows Seismitoad to remove the likes of Heliolisk and Togedemaru as well as punish Pokemon like Garbodor from setting up entry hazards freely against Seismitoad. Protect is an option to scout for coverage and status while still racking up a turn of Toxic damage. It can also allow Seismitoad to gain a free turn of Leftovers recovery, but Seismitoad has to drop Earthquake leaving it more vulnerable when pressuring threats like Heliolisk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given 232 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Seismitoad to outpace Magmortar, Decidueye, and Samurott to effectively rack up multiple turns of Toxic damage with Substitute or potentially put them on a timer as a last-ditch effort and, in the former's case, to remove it with Earthquake. The rest of the EVs are invested into bulk with a Bold nature to allow Seismitoad to still pivot into threats like Incineroar and Aerodactyl. Leftovers is vital for Seismitoad to passively recover its health, especially when it continually reduces its health with Substitute. Water Absorb grants Seismitoad an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to take advantage of Pokemon like Blastoise and opposing Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While this set can look to pivot into Pokemon it can check like Aerodactyl and Garbodor, its main goal is to spread Toxic to whittle down its switch-ins, so Seismitoad should attempt to come in on a free switch rather than take too much unnecessary damage. It is important for Seismitoad to be behind a Substitute in order to safely get a Toxic off against some of its checks such as Sceptile, Decidueye, and Alolan Exeggutor as well as beat Pokemon like Vaporeon and defensive Druddigon one-on-one, which are unable to break its Substitute or wear down Seismitoad with status like Toxic as a result. Substitute should not be used too liberally, as it is important that Seismitoad conserves enough health to pivot into threats like Aerodactyl, especially with it being reliant on Leftovers as its source of recovery. Seismitoad is also very susceptible to Knock Off for this reason. Status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp similarly hinder Seismitoad's effectiveness, so it should not switch too liberally into common status users. Water Absorb gives Seismitoad the potential to switch into Pokemon like Blastoise and opposing Seismitoad to recover lost health; however, Seismitoad has to be careful of getting poisoned by Toxic in the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seismitoad beating bulky Water-types is greatly appreciated by Pokemon like Magmortar and Mega Glalie, both of which are unable to effectively break past Water-types like Vaporeon and Slowking without specific coverage moves. In return, Mega Glalie and Magmortar are able to threaten Grass-types, and Mega Glalie can also set up Spikes to stack residual damage with Seismitoad's Toxic. Fire-types like Delphox and Incineroar are great partners, as they can pressure the many Grass-types like Whimsicott and Sceptile that threaten Seismitoad. Delphox also has the ability to greatly improve Seismitoad's longevity through Wish support, especially with it reducing its health with Substitute a lot. Delphox also invites Water- and Rock-types such as Vaporeon and Rhydon, which gives Seismitoad an opportunity to switch in and set up a free Substitute. Defensive Incineroar's access to a slow U-turn combined with its tendency to invite in bulky Ground-types like Rhydon helps Seismitoad secure an opportunity to come in and fire off its STAB coverage or set up a free Substitute. Incineroar also checks the many Grass-types that force out Seismitoad and appreciates Seismitoad's ability to absorb the Water coverage aimed at it in return. Other slow pivots such as Vikavolt and Xatu work well with Seismitoad, as it appreciates the safe switches in. Vikavolt also helps switch into the Grass-types that threaten Seismitoad and retaliate with its Bug-type STAB moves to remove them. Pokemon such as Samurott and Heliolisk appreciate Seismitoad luring in Grass-types like Dhelmise and Decidueye to cripple them with Toxic. Late-game cleaners such as Braviary, Comfey, and Vivillon appreciate Seismitoad's ability to cripple a multitude of Pokemon and remove Pokemon like Rotom and Togedemaru for them to sweep more easily.</p>"

  "Sawk": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Sawk sports better Attack and Speed than Passimian, its lack of U-turn leaves it unable to do much versus defensive Slowking, and its reliance on Close Combat for wallbreaking leaves it easily taken advantage of by Pokemon like Xatu, Comfey, and Rotom. Additionally, although Sturdy can be utilized to provide aid against revenge killers, Sawk's poor bulk compounded with a lacking defensive typing makes it difficult to get Sawk safely onto the field. Sawk is also extremely prediction-reliant, since its coverage moves often fail to threaten Pokemon they aren't super effective against.</p>",

Additionally, Sawk can increase its wallbreaking power with an Adamant nature instead of Jolly at the cost of no longer outspeeding Magmortar. Mold Breaker is the preferred ability so that Sawk can hit Weezing with Earthquake, although Sturdy prevents Sawk from being easily revenge killed by faster threats like Vivillon and Choice Specs Heliolisk. However, Sawk is an inferior choice to Passimian due to the latter's access to U-turn, which makes it a great pivot while also being a solid wallbreaker. Sawk also faces competition from Medicham, which has a secondary STAB in Psychic and is much stronger thanks to its ability Pure Power.</p>"}},

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott makes for a good wallbreaker thanks to its defensive typing, usable Special Attack, and coverage options helping it switch into Pokemon such as Passimian, Vaporeon, and Scrafty and threaten potential switch-ins such as Incineroar, Garbodor, and Weezing with solid damage. These traits combined with U-turn and a great Speed tier also make Whimsicott a good pivot that can force out Pokemon such as Sneasel, Alolan Exeggutor, and Seismitoad and bring in the appropriate check. Unfortunately, Whimsicott's Special Attack stat leaves it unable to break through sturdier special walls such as Delphox, Mega Audino, and Ferroseed, while Assault Vest Slowking can also easily scout what Whimsicott locks itself into thanks to its titanic bulk and Regenerator. Additionally, because Whimsicott often uses its defensive typing to switch in and wallbreak, it struggles to stay out of range of priority moves such as Pangoro and Medicham's Bullet Punch and Sneasel's Ice Shard and is prone to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users with super effective coverage moves such as Passimian and Togedemaru.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off lets Whimsicott cripple Golbat, allowing it to 2HKO it with Psychic, as well as remove Steelix and Delphox's Leftovers and Incineroar's pinch Berry. However, Whimsicott is immediately forced out after using it. Memento is also an option over U-turn that enables Whimsicott to better support setup Pokemon such as Incineroar, Pangoro, and Delphox. Whimsicott can run a SubSeed set that synergizes very well with Toxic Spikes support and helps it bypass certain checks such as Delphox better. However, such a set lacks wallbreaking power and is easily handled by Golbat thanks to Infiltrator. A 3 attacks set with Defog or Encore can work thanks to Prankster enabling Whimsicott to almost always get a Defog off, but the ubiquity of Incineroar hurts this set greatly, and Life Orb recoil makes Whimsicott a less consistent switch-in to Water-types. A support set with moves like Sunny Day, U-turn, and Encore can aid Pokemon such as Victreebel and Charizard extremely well, although such a set is limited to dedicated sun teams. Hidden Power Ground lets Whimsicott lure in and KO Togedemaru while heavily damaging Fire-types such as Delphox and Magmortar, although it has little use outside of this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Delphox, particularly Wish variants, can easily switch into anything Whimsicott uses and retaliate with super effective damage. Incineroar takes neutral damage from Moonblast, although it can easily take Whimsicott's other moves as well as Moonblast if it's a bulkier variant. Magmortar dislikes taking repeated hits, especially if Stealth Rock is set, but it can switch into Whimsicott's STAB attacks fairly well and retaliate with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Golbat, Garbodor, and Weezing can all switch into Whimsicott's STAB attacks with ease and respond with super effective damage. However, none of them want to switch into Psychic, and Weezing can struggle to take repetitive hits due to its lacking special bulk and unreliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steelix takes a fair bit from Energy Ball, but it can switch into anything else with ease and OHKO Whimsicott with Heavy Slam or set Stealth Rock. Even offensive variants of Togedemaru aren't 2HKOed by Whimsicott, while specially defensive ones take negligible damage from Whimsicott and can use it as Wish fodder. Ferroseed walls Whimsicott and can set Spikes against it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Although none of them can safely switch into Whimsicott, Pokemon like Sneasel, Choice Scarf Passimian, Aerodactyl, and Pangoro can revenge kill it with the appropriate amount of chip damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast threatens Fighting- and Dark-types such as Passimian, Scrafty, and Sneasel and is Whimsicott's best source of damage against Incineroar. Energy Ball targets Ground- and Water-types such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Blastoise. Psychic lets Whimsicott damage Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing super effectively. U-turn enables Whimsicott to pivot out of bad matchups against Pokemon like Delphox and Magmortar. Switcheroo is an option that lets Whimsicott cripple certain checks to it such as Incineroar and Golbat, although U-turn is generally preferred to make Whimsicott a better offensive pivot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature and Choice Specs makes Whimsicott as offensively threatening as possible. Infiltrator lets Whimsicott bypass Substitute and dual screens.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Whimsicott should make use of its defensive typing to switch into Pokemon such as Passimian, Scrafty, and Samurott to wallbreak. It should be noted, however, that switching into Knock Off from the likes of Passimian and Pangoro can be detrimental to Whimsicott's wallbreaking capabilities. Because Whimsicott commonly draws in Poison-types, take advantage of that by dealing heavy damage to them with Psychic. Whimsicott struggles to successfully break bulky variants of Incineroar and Delphox and can't make great headway against dedicated special walls like Mega Audino; therefore, pivoting out with U-turn into the appropriate check to such Pokemon is usually the best play. If running Switcheroo, look to cripple Whimsicott's checks such as Incineroar and Steelix by removing their item. However, similarly to losing its item via Knock Off, this will leave Whimsicott much weaker.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Whimsicott is a great fit on offensive builds thanks to its defensive utility and ability to keep up momentum with U-turn. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Rhydon, Druddigon, and Piloswine is essential alongside Whimsicott, since it helps weaken checks such as Incineroar, Delphox, and Golbat. Rhydon and Druddigon can also check Fire-types, while Piloswine can switch into Ice-types. Rhydon and Piloswine can also both check Flying-types like Aerodactyl and Vivillon. In return, Whimsicott threatens Water-types like Blastoise and Seismitoad. Similarly, Spikes support from Garbodor helps wear down checks to Whimsicott such as Ferroseed and opposing Garbodor and synergizes well with Whimsicott's U-turn. Garbodor also appreciates Whimsicott's ability to check Rhydon. Since Whimsicott commonly draws in Poison-types, Pokemon such as Delphox and Rotom that can take advantage of them are ideal. Similarly, Pokemon such as Passimian and Scrafty that appreciate Whimsicott luring in and heavily damaging Poison-types with Psychic are also good partners. Passimian also forms a VoltTurn core with Whimsicott and threatens several Pokemon such as Sneasel and Aerodactyl that may try to revenge kill Whimsicott. Although Whimsicott can switch into Water- and Ground-types, its lacking bulk means it struggles to consistently, so pairing Whimsicott with a bulky Water-type like Slowking or Blastoise helps alleviate pressure from it. Slowking can also help check Delphox and Magmortar, while Blastoise can handle Incineroar and Sneasel.</p>"

  "Lilligant": {
    "overview": "<p>Lilligant's access to Quiver Dance and Sleep Powder, decent Special Attack, and Speed are offset by its mediocre bulk, movepool, and typing. Lilligant struggles to set up, and even when it does, common Pokemon such as Togedemaru, Dhelmise, Decidueye, and Alolan Exeggutor can deal with it. Moreover, it's extremely prediction reliant, as Breakneck Blitz can only be used once, leaving it susceptible to threats like Incineroar if used at the wrong time. As a Quiver Dance user, it suffers competition from Vivillon, which has a better offensive movepool and typing, giving it more setup opportunities against threats like Passimian locked into Close Combat. Lastly, it is hard to justify over other, more reliable Grass-types like Sceptile, which is faster and more immediately threatening due to its movepool and ability to run a boosting item, and Whimsicott, which has a better typing, is faster, and has numerous utility options.</p>",

Decidueye and Dhelmise are especially problematic, as they completely wall it. Moreover, this set is better done by Vivillon, which has a better offensive typing and movepool while still having access to Sleep Powder, letting it bypass checks more reliably.</p>"}},

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Scrafty is a great setup sweeper due to the combination of its unique typing, great bulk, and amazing abilities. Said unique typing gives Scrafty great STAB moves, including Knock Off, High Jump Kick, and Drain Punch, which let it handle common Dark-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types such as Incineroar, Rotom, and Slowking. Thanks to its great bulk, Scrafty has an easy time setting up on passive Pokemon and can make teams that depend on common defensive cores, like Steelix + Slowking and Vaporeon + Silvally-Steel, really struggle. The ability Shed Skin gives Scrafty a way to also set up on Pokemon like Rotom and Vaporeon, which rely on spreading status conditions with moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. However, Scrafty has a really poor Speed tier, making it easy to revenge kill with common Choice Scarf users like Passimian and other fast Pokemon like Whimsicott and Sceptile even after a Dragon Dance boost. It's also extremely susceptible to Fairy-types, like Whimsicott, Aromatisse, and Comfey, and Pokemon that run Fairy-type coverage moves, such as Mismagius and Delphox.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scrafty can use Psychium Z alongside Zen Headbutt on Dragon Dance sets to lure in and KO Poison-types like Weezing, Garbodor, and Golbat. However, Chople Berry is usually preferred so that Passimian cannot revenge kill Scrafty as easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Audino, Whimsicott, and Comfey take Scrafty's hits and OHKO it back. Comfey's Triage Draining Kiss makes it a particularly great stop to Dragon Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Garbodor resists Scrafty's Fighting-type STAB moves, takes Knock Off, and can punish Scrafty with Rocky Helmet damage, Drain Punch, and setting Spikes. Golbat can sponge all of Scrafty's moves and do great damage in return thanks to Brave Bird; however, it has to fear losing its item due to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Passimian is one of Scrafty's most common checks due to its great bulk and Speed tier. Passimian resists Scrafty's Dark-type STAB moves while also taking its Fighting-type STAB moves and OHKOing it in return with Close Combat. Hariyama can also take all of Scrafty's moves and OHKO it with Close Combat. Medicham can punish Bulk Up sets, as it can OHKO Scrafty with High Jump Kick even after two Defense boosts.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Braviary is a reliable check to Scrafty, being able to take every hit and OHKO it with Brave Bird. Vivillon is also a solid check, resisting Scrafty's Fighting-type moves while absorbing Knock Offs with Flyinium Z and OHKOing it with Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon</strong>: Whimsicott, Sceptile, and common Choice Scarf users such as Passimian and Braviary are solid checks due to having the ability to outspeed and OHKO Scrafty even after a Dragon Dance boost.</p>",

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up provides Scrafty with a way to boost its Attack and Defense stats by one stage, making it a threatening setup sweeper. Knock Off is the main STAB move and allows Scrafty to cripple counters, such as Whimsicott, Passimian and Golbat, by removing their items while also doing decent damage. Having Drain Punch as Scrafty's secondary STAB move gives it a form of recovery while also decently damaging bulky Stealth Rock users like Steelix and Rhydon and smacking Dark-types such as Incineroar and Sneasel. Rest gives Scrafty an additional form of recovery, and the sleep penalty can be cured by Shed Skin.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in HP and Special Defense paired with a Careful nature maximizes Scrafty's special bulk while taking minimal damage from entry hazards. Leftovers gives Scrafty a form of passive recovery throughout the match. Shed Skin is the ability of choice because it provides it a great way to absorb and then cure status like sleep induced by Rest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scrafty should generally use its Shed Skin and great bulk to switch into passive Pokemon, like Palossand, Vaporeon and Ferroseed, and status-inducing moves. Thanks to its ability, Scrafty can be used as a great status absorber for teams that struggle against Pokemon like Slowking and Rotom. While it's in play, Scrafty should use Knock Off to cripple its checks and counters like Passimian and Whimsicott. Once these checks are weakened, it will have an easier time setting up and pressuring defensive teams. Since it's 4x weak to Fairy, Scrafty should be cautious of Pokemon like Mismagius and Delphox, which can carry Dazzling Gleam, and Fairy-types like Mega Audino and Comfey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Scrafty's lack of immediate power, Pokemon that provide entry hazard support, such as Garbodor, Ferroseed, Steelix, and Rhydon, make great partners and give Scrafty an easier way to pressure its checks and counters. Garbodor, Ferroseed, and Steelix can also deal with Fairy-type Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Comfey, while Rhydon and Steelix can handle Flying-type Pokemon like Braviary and Scyther. Silvally-Steel also makes a great partner because it can check most Fairy-type Pokemon and creates setup opportunities with Parting Shot. Scrafty appreciates Psychic-type Pokemon such as Sigilyph, Slowking and Delphox because they deal with threatening Fighting- and Poison-types like Passimian, Garbodor, and Weezing. Pokemon like Passimian, Guzzlord, and Roseli Berry Druddigon can run super effective coverage to lure in and KO Fairy-type Pokemon, helping Scrafty remove these Pokemon from the game.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance is Scrafty's main way of setting up, boosting its Attack and Speed stats by one stage. High Jump Kick is the strongest STAB move that Scrafty can use, causing decent damage to most of its checks, including Passimian and Whimsicott. Knock Off is Scrafty's most spammable STAB move and can hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Decidueye, Mismagius, and Delphox for super effective damage. It also has the ability to remove items and do great damage to a good part of the metagame. Removing items can be very helpful, as it allows Scrafty to cripple Comfey and Golbat. Drain Punch gives Scrafty a more reliable Fighting-type attack that can also provide recovery and increase its longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature maximize Scrafty's offensive presence while letting it outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon after one Dragon Dance boost. Chople Berry allows Scrafty to survive moves like Passimian's Close Combat at full HP. Shed Skin gives Scrafty a chance to cure any status condition that could otherwise cripple it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should use Knock Off and High Jump Kick early-game to weaken Scrafty's checks and counters. Knock Off should be used to remove items from checks like Comfey and Golbat, while High Jump Kick should be used to weaken checks such as Passimian and Whimsicott. However, High Jump Kick should not be used recklessly, as a Ghost-type like Decidueye, Rotom, or Palossand could switch in. Once the majority of Scrafty's check and counters are weakened, try to set up on Pokemon that can't heavily damage it like Steelix, Cryogonal, and Palossand. However, if Scrafty isn't using Shed Skin, it should worry about status conditions from Scald and Toxic users like Slowking and Blastoise. If it's paired with Healing Wish support, you can use Scrafty early-game to break defensive cores and weaken the opposing team, then switch it out to be used again if needed. If Scrafty is holding a Chople Berry, it has an easier time setting up even if the opponent has a Fighting-type Pokemon such as Passimian. If you have one Dragon Dance up while facing a Choice Scarf Passimian, set up again because you can outspeed the following turn and do a lot of damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor, Rhydon, and Ferroseed make great partners for Scrafty because they can provide entry hazard support, making it easier to whittle down Scrafty's check and counters, and are great Fairy- and Flying-type checks. Silvally-Steel can be a great partner, dealing with Fairy-types and providing setup opportunities with Parting Shot. Palossand, Weezing, and Slowking all make great teammates thanks to their countering Fighting-types. Mesprit especially makes a great partner since it can provide Healing Wish and Stealth Rock support. This gives you the ability to use Scrafty in a more aggressive way early-game to seriously weaken its counters and sweep later on.</p>"

  "Sigilyph": {
    "overview": "<p>Sigilyph is one of the most versatile offensive Pokemon in NU thanks to the combination of its many great attributes. To begin, it has two fantastic abilities to aid in its offensive prowess. Magic Guard prevents indirect damage such as Stealth Rock damage, poison damage from Toxic, and Life Orb recoil, which, combined with its access to Roost, Calm Mind, and Cosmic Power, gives it great durability. Tinted Lens, meanwhile, can increase its damage output against Pokemon that resist its STAB coverage. Sigilyph also has a decent Speed tier as well as a good Special Attack stat with a very wide offensive movepool that includes Heat Wave and Energy Ball to deal with Steel-types that resist its STAB moves as well as common Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Steelix. Unfortunately, Sigilyph's defensive typing and Speed tier leave it vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped and threatened by faster offensive threats such as Heliolisk, Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Mega Glalie as well as common Choice Scarf Pokemon like Passimian and Togedemaru. While it may have a high Special Attack, certain sets are walled by specially defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Delphox.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sigilyph can also run support options on the Life Orb set such as Defog and Thunder Wave, since the last moveslot is extremely flexible. Defog is especially appealing, since Sigilyph is immune to Stealth Rock damage thanks to Magic Guard. A set with Flame Orb and Psycho Shift is an alternative variation of the Calm Mind Flyinium Z set with the benefit of being able to spread burns while being immune to paralysis caused by Thunder Wave from Slowking and Regirock and Glare from Druddigon. However, it loses the option of an emergency nuke in Supersonic Skystrike, the defensive buffer that Psycho Shift provides is less reliable than that of Cosmic Power, and it is hard walled by Incineroar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Incineroar and Guzzlord can easily switch into Sigilyph and threaten it out of the match. Other Dark-types such as Sneasel, Absol, and Houndoom can also achieve the same thing but do not want to switch directly into Sigilyph's moves. Sneasel also threatens to Pursuit trap Sigilyph.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Sigilyph is often forced out by faster threats such as Heliolisk, Aerodactyl, Delphox, and Mismagius; Heliolisk always threatens Sigilyph with its STAB moves, Aerodactyl resists Air Slash, KOes Sigilyph with Stone Edge, and threatens to Pursuit trap it, Calm Mind Delphox can easily overpower Sigilyph, and Mismagius can revenge kill Sigilyph by overpowering Cosmic Power variants with Nasty Plot. Choice Scarf users such as Passimian and Togedemaru can also threaten Sigilyph.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Any set lacking Psyshock cannot really hurt specially bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon, Assault Vest Slowking, or Wish Delphox, so they can usually pivot into its moves and force Sigilyph out. These Pokemon are threatened by Choice Specs sets, however.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Sigilyph is threatened by Pokemon like Mega Glalie, Piloswine, and Mega Abomasnow, since they can either outspeed it or pressure it with Ice Shard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is Sigilyph's most spammable move that can help damage Dark-type switch-ins such as Incineroar, Sneasel, and Pangoro. Heat Wave is Sigilyph's best way to deal with Steel-type Pokemon such as Steelix and Togedemaru. Energy Ball can deal with Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Regirock as well as bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blastoise. Roost could also be used to keep Sigilyph healthy throughout the match and give Sigilyph more opportunities to safely switch in, such as against Golbat, Garbodor, and Vaporeon. Meanwhile, Protect can scout for Choice-locked attacks from the likes of Sneasel, Heliolisk, Aerodactyl, and Passimian as well as punish Pursuit and U-turn attempts. Psyshock is another strong STAB option to OHKO Pokemon such as Golbat, Heliolisk, and Garbodor after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Guard is Sigilyph's best ability for this set because it protects Sigilyph from indirect damage from Stealth Rock, Toxic poison, and Life Orb recoil, making Life Orb a great item choice to boost Sigilyph's power. With a Timid nature and maximum Speed investment, Sigilyph is just fast enough to outspeed Pokemon like Golbat and Rotom without Choice Scarf and fire off a strong attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sigilyph can come in against certain Pokemon's moves like Passimian's Close Combat, but it usually prefers not to, since it needs to be healthy enough to wallbreak throughout the match. It can also be brought in on a double switch, with the help of a pivot, or even against more passive Pokemon such as Xatu, Vaporeon, and Decidueye. Magic Guard helps Sigilyph come in more easily, since it makes it immune to Stealth Rock damage, and preserve its health, since it doesn't take Life Orb recoil. It's because of this amazing ability that Sigilyph can even be at 1% health and still be able to come in on a double switch and continue to wallbreak. Have your team set up entry hazards as soon as possible so Sigilyph can net more 2HKOs and OHKOs, making some threats like Incineroar and Sneasel much more manageable. Air Slash is the safest move to spam, since it can hit Dark-type switch-ins like Incineroar for decent damage. Since Sigilyph does force switches against Pokemon like Dhelmise and Seismitoad, it can be a good idea to go ahead and heal with Roost. If running Protect, use it to scout for Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Togedemaru.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sigilyph needs entry hazard support to help it net important OHKOs and 2HKOs. Pokemon like Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Garbodor can fit this role excellently. Garbodor can also exploit the switches that Sigilyph forces so it can set up Spikes more easily. Druddigon is also notable, since it can set up Stealth Rock against Xatu and threaten Heliolisk and Rotom thanks to Mold Breaker. All of these Pokemon appreciate Sigilyph's ability to deal with hazard removers such as Golbat, Dhelmise, and Blastoise. Since Sigilyph threatens Grass-types, Pokemon like Slowking, Rhydon, and Sceptile make good partners. These Pokemon also appreciate Sigilyph's ability to switch into Toxic and act as a status absorber. Similarly, Pokemon that are weak to Fighting-type attacks like Heliolisk, Togedemaru, and Pangoro appreciate Sigilyph's ability to switch into Close Combat from Choice Scarf Passimian. Pokemon that can set up on Dark-types such as Incineroar, Comfey, and Scrafty also make great partners that make Sigilyph's time wallbreaking easier. Incineroar and Scrafty can also threaten Ice-types like Sneasel and Mega Glalie for Sigilyph. Pivots like Xatu, Rotom, and Togedemaru can help bring Sigilyph in safely. Togedemaru can also take Electric-type attacks for Sigilyph.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is the safest STAB move to spam thanks to the lack of Pokemon immune to it. Heat Wave is used to hit Steel-types such as Steelix, Togedemaru, and Silvally-Steel hard as well as OHKO Vikavolt. Energy Ball can OHKO Rhydon and Seismitoad and 2HKO Vaporeon, which Sigilyph cannot do otherwise. Psyshock allows Sigilyph to OHKO Heliolisk and 2HKO Delphox and Assault Vest Slowking after Stealth Rock damage. Psychic is Sigilyph's strongest move and is safe to use against Pokemon like Steelix.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread and Choice Specs, Sigilyph becomes a threatening wallbreaker with amazing damage output. Tinted Lens means Sigilyph doesn't really need to predict and can spam its coverage moves much more easily. For example, Psyshock 2HKOes Slowking, and Air Slash will 2HKO Rotom and offensive Rhydon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Sigilyph can function as a powerful wallbreaker that can break down or even 2HKO defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Steelix for its team. Because this set forgoes Magic Guard in exchange for Tinted Lens, getting rid of Stealth Rock should be a priority before Sigilyph can begin wallbreaking. It is advisable to bring Sigilyph in with a pivot, with a predicted double switch, or against resisted hits such as Passimian's Close Combat. Thanks to Tinted Lens, Sigilyph can even deal with Pokemon that resist its STAB moves normally. Even Slowking and Steelix need to be cautious of directly switching into Sigilyph because it can 2HKO them with Psyshock and Air Slash, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Sigilyph is great for balanced teams that need a powerful wallbreaker. Since this Pokemon is great at whittling down Steelix, Slowking, and Rhydon, partners like Heliolisk, Comfey, and Braviary are able to use their STAB moves more freely. Any Pokemon with entry hazard control such as Xatu, Rotom, Dhelmise, or Blastoise can make a great partner for Sigilyph so it doesn't have to switch into Stealth Rock when it attempts to wallbreak. Blastoise can also draw in Grass-types for Sigilyph. Pivots such as Passimian, Heliolisk, and Togedemaru can help bring Sigilyph safely into battle. Passimian and Togedemaru also appreciate Sigilyph's ability to break down Slowking and Steelix, and Passimian can also check Dark-types for Sigilyph. Hazard setters like Rhydon, Steelix, and Seismitoad can help Sigilyph net important 2HKOs or even OHKOs such as against Assault Vest Slowking. Pokemon such as Passimian, Vikavolt, and Magmortar appreciate Sigilyph's ability to check bulky Pokemon such as Slowking, Rhydon, and Weezing so they can spam their own STAB moves much more. In return, these Pokemon can help keep Pokemon that threaten Sigilyph such as Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Incineroar at bay. A cleric such as Vaporeon and Mega Audino can help heal Sigilyph with Wish and Heal Bell support.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind + Flyinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Sigilyph's damage output, turning it into a dangerous sweeper. Air Slash has amazing neutral coverage, making it a good move to spam. Roost keeps Sigilyph healthy so it can continue to sweep and allows it to switch into weak attacks like Scald from Vaporeon and defensive Slowking with more ease. Cosmic Power can make Sigilyph hard to revenge kill, since it boosts both of its defenses. Stored Power can be used as a potential nuke against Flying-resistant Pokemon like Rhydon and Rotom after using Supersonic Skystrike, while also giving Sigilyph an advantage over stall teams. This move requires multiple boosts to be potent, however. Protect can give Sigilyph a safety net against Pursuit from Sneasel and Aerodactyl as well as other potential Choice item users such as Heliolisk and Togedemaru.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Sigilyph to outspeed Pokemon such as Rotom without a Choice Scarf and Golbat. The remaining EVs should aim to maximize Sigilyph's bulk. Magic Guard allows Sigilyph to avoid damage from Stealth Rock and Toxic poison, giving it more opportunities to begin setting up. Flyinium Z turns Air Slash into a one-time nuke to deal heavy damage to Pokemon such as pivot Incineroar and Druddigon, as well as KOing Sneasel after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Sigilyph should be used as a late-game sweeper if its checks and counters are weakened or knocked out, but it can take out certain threats mid-game if it needs to. This Sigilyph can actually pivot into direct attacks thanks to its invested bulk, but it should still aim to come into attacks it resists such as Passimian's Close Combat and Choice Specs Sceptile's Leaf Storm. Sigilyph can also come into battle against more passive Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Vaporeon, and Blastoise to take any incoming Toxic or Scald, since it is immune to the residual damage from poison and burns thanks to Magic Guard. From here it can begin setting up Calm Mind or Cosmic Power. Once it has boosted, Sigilyph can use Supersonic Skystrike to net important KOs against certain Pokemon that its team may struggle against, such as Druddigon, Comfey, and pivot Incineroar. If running Protect, use it to scout for potential Choice Scarf and Choice Specs users like Togedemaru and Heliolisk and Pursuit from Sneasel and Aerodactyl. Afterwards, it can punish the former by OHKOing it with a boosted Supersonic Skystrike after Stealth Rock damage or pivot into the appropriate answer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Seismitoad make good partners that help Sigilyph net OHKOs or 2HKOs with its Z-Move after boosting, such as against bulky Incineroar, Sneasel, and Druddigon. Pivots such as Passimian, Rotom, and Togedemaru can bring Sigilyph in safely. Passimian and Togedemaru can also check Sneasel, Rhydon, and Heliolisk for Sigilyph, and it can check Pokemon like Dhelmise and Weezing for them in return. Defensive Pokemon like Incineroar, Delphox, Decidueye, and Slowking appreciate Sigilyph's ability to take Toxic for them. Incineroar can also help deal with Sneasel and Delphox for Sigilyph, while Decidueye can soft check Pokemon like Heliolisk and Assault Vest Slowking for Sigilyph. In return, Sigilyph can help check Passimian for these teammates. Pokemon like Magmortar, Alolan Exeggutor, and Slowking can dispatch of Pokemon that resist Air Slash such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Togedemaru.</p>"

  "Garbodor": {
    "overview": "<p>Garbodor is one of NU's most reliable Spikes setters thanks to its workable bulk, its very useful defensive typing, and its power that allows it to forcibly bypass Xatu. Furthermore, Garbodor's pure Poison typing and above average defensive stats mean it can function as a check to some of NU's most threatening Pokemon in Passimian and Comfey. A wide offensive movepool combined with workable base 95 Attack lets Garbodor threaten Xatu with a STAB Gunk Shot while threatening Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Silvally-Steel with Seed Bomb and Stomping Tantrum. In addition, a utility movepool including Spikes and Toxic Spikes and options such as Explosion and Pain Split gives Garbodor the ability to easily set up entry hazards against an enemy team and either keep them up or keep itself healthy. However, while Gunk Shot is fairly powerful, Garbodor's only good Attack means that it struggles to threaten Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix, even with its coverage options. Furthermore, while its bulk is good enough to take resisted hits, Garbodor finds itself taking significant damage from neutral attacks, and it finds itself threatened by coverage moves, taking very heavy damage from Passimian's Earthquake and Whimsicott's Psychic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poisonium Z can be used on the offensive set to guarantee a hit against Xatu while still offering an easy 2HKO against it. However, a team's Z-Crystal is often better spent elsewhere. Weak Armor can be used to give Garbodor a Speed boost when it is hit, letting it potentially set more entry hazards, but the Defense drop it incurs means it is far less reliable as a check to enemy Fighting-types. Garbodor can be run on rain teams with Rain Dance to provide the archetype with a Comfey check, although Rain Dance is entirely useless on any other build.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Seismitoad all resist Gunk Shot and threaten to heavily damage Garbodor with Earthquake. Steelix is especially worth mention, as it is immune to Gunk Shot, and it is not hit hard by any of Garbodor's other moves.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: While Garbodor can 2HKO Xatu with Gunk Shot, its Magic Bounce can still reflect Garbodor's Spikes, nullifying a turn and hurting Garbodor's team.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Golbat and Rotom take little damage from any move Garbodor can use against them, are immune to Spikes, and can easily Defog away Spikes, making them exceptional answers to Garbodor. Blastoise and Silvally-Steel are vulnerable to Gunk Shot and Stomping Tantrum respectively but can quickly remove the Spikes that Garbodor sets.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Passimian and Dhelmise can deal very heavy damage to Garbodor with coverage moves such as Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot lets Garbodor always 2HKO Xatu with either a Toxic Plate or an Adamant nature, as well as threaten Pokemon such as Comfey and Delphox. Spikes and Toxic Spikes wear down opposing Pokemon, helping out Garbodor's team, and Garbodor is a good user of the moves thanks to its great defensive typing and ability to bypass Xatu. Stomping Tantrum can be used if Toxic Spikes is not needed, is Garbodor's hardest-hitting move against Steelix and Klinklang, and threatens opposing Garbodor. Alternatively, Seed Bomb can be used to wear down Seismitoad and Rhydon for Garbodor, which can be very beneficial for its team. Explosion prevents the opponent from using Defog or Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, provided that Garbodor is faster than the enemy, while also dealing very heavy damage. Pain Split can be used in the last moveslot to keep Garbodor at high HP over the course of a match, preventing it from being worn down too much, and can make matchups against Pokemon such as Comfey and Sceptile significantly easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and an Adamant nature maximize Garbodor's power, enabling it to 2HKO Xatu with Gunk Shot, as well as hit targets such as Decidueye and Vaporeon for heavy damage. Maximum Speed is needed to outrun Xatu as well as Pokemon such as Incineroar. A Jolly nature can be used with Toxic Plate to maintain the 2HKO on Xatu and outrun standard Comfey and maximum Speed Decidueye. If using an Adamant nature, Black Sludge can be used to give Garbodor useful recovery, significantly increasing its longevity, while a Rocky Helmet can be used to damage any Pokemon making contact with it, such as Passimian using U-turn. Toxic Plate can be run with an Adamant nature if being able to 2HKO Blastoise after Stealth Rock is needed. Aftermath is used to deal recoil damage to the foe if they KO Garbodor with a contact move, such as Comfey's Draining Kiss or Passimian's Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Garbodor is often better off using Gunk Shot if the opponent has a Xatu, as it can immediately bounce back any Spikes Garbodor uses if it switches in correctly. Gunk Shot deals heavy damage to most Pokemon that do not resist it and can be used to buy a turn to use Spikes, for example against Vaporeon, which is often forced to Wish if it switches into Gunk Shot. Garbodor should be brought in often against Grass-types such as Sceptile, as the more turns it has to set up Spikes, the more Garbodor can support its team. Be careful of coverage moves such as Earthquake from Passimian and status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Weezing, as they can leave Garbodor crippled for the rest of a match. Explosion should be used when the opponent is predicted to use either Defog or Rapid Spin, as it stops them from removing entry hazards while also dealing heavy damage. If it's running the correct coverage, an enemy such as Silvally-Steel or Blastoise using Defog or Rapid Spin can often be a free turn for Garbodor to attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor generally needs teammates to take on enemy Ground-types for it, so Pokemon such as Sceptile, Alolan Exeggutor, and Seismitoad can make good teammates. Magic Bounce and Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Xatu, Dhelmise, and Blastoise allows Garbodor to keep its Spikes up even if its team requires enemy hazards removed. Pokemon such as Klinklang, Comfey, and Passimian all appreciate the entry hazard support that Garbodor provides, which can easily wear down Pokemon such as Steelix and Delphox for them. Wallbreakers such as Magmortar and Alolan Exeggutor also benefit from Garbodor's Spikes support thanks to the number of switches they force. Stealth Rock users such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Piloswine are good teammates, building on the hazard pressure that Garbodor provides. Rhydon and Piloswine are especially good options, as they provide another method to pressure Xatu. Pokemon such as Heliolisk and Incineroar are able to beat Golbat and Rotom for Garbodor, Pokemon that it otherwise struggles with.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot pressures Xatu, 2HKOing it if it poisons it, and OHKOes Comfey, although its lacking PP and low accuracy make it unreliable to spam. Spikes wears down enemy Pokemon, helping out Garbodor's team, and Garbodor has the typing and defensive stats to come in multiple times to set them, while it has the power to bypass Xatu, a common entry hazard control option. Toxic Spikes gives Garbodor an additional move with which to support its team, easily and quickly wearing down defensive Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Rhydon, and Torterra for Garbodor's team. Alternatively, Seed Bomb can be used to wear down Seismitoad and Rhydon for Garbodor. Pain Split keeps Garbodor at high HP over the course of a match, preventing it from being worn down too much, and can make matchups against Pokemon such as Comfey and Sceptile significantly easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and 228 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature give Garbodor good special bulk, letting it take only 33% from Sceptile's Leaf Storm and easily wall Comfey. 28 Speed EVs let Garbodor outrun defensive Blastoise as well as Modest Alolan Exeggutor. Black Sludge keeps Garbodor healthy, mitigating chip damage taken from Stealth Rock and preventing it from being worn down as easily. Aftermath causes any Pokemon that KOes Garbodor with a contact move to take significant recoil damage. Rocky Helmet can be used to punish any opponent that makes contact with Garbodor, notably easily wearing down enemy Comfey and punishing U-turns from Pokemon such as Passimian. A physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 228 Def / 28 Spe can also be used to better take on Pokemon such as Passimian. However, this leaves Garbodor significantly more vulnerable to Sceptile, and Garbodor remains vulnerable to the coverage moves many physical threats carry.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If facing Xatu, don't immediately try to set up Spikes, as an opponent will often try to reflect them or scout which Garbodor set is being run by switching into it. Better options are to use Gunk Shot to damage Xatu or switch out to a teammate that can punish it such as Sneasel or Heliolisk. When against an opponent without Xatu, it is often helpful to immediately set up entry hazards, as it will force the opponent to quickly remove them, or they will consistently take significant damage. Garbodor should generally be brought in against attacks it resists, such as Comfey's Draining Kiss and Passimian's Close Combat, although it should be wary of coverage moves, such as Passimian's Earthquake. Prioritize Spikes over Toxic Spikes if the opponent has a grounded Poison-type such as their own Garbodor, and generally try to prioritize Toxic Spikes if the opponent's hazard remover is vulnerable to Toxic Spikes or if the opponent has a Pokemon such as Slowking or Dhelmise that needs to be poisoned. Aftermath can be used to deal significant damage to the opponent that KOes Garbodor, so try to keep Garbodor around for the right time once it gets to low HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates such as Sneasel, Heliolisk, and Incineroar that can take on Xatu for Garbodor are helpful, with the former being able to Pursuit trap Xatu, potentially removing it from the game. Garbodor generally needs teammates to take on enemy Ground-types for it, so Pokemon such as Sceptile, Decidueye, and Seismitoad can make good teammates. Entry hazard removal that keeps Garbodor's Spikes up is preferred, so Pokemon such as Xatu, Blastoise, and Dhelmise are excellent teammates. Toxic Spikes support is greatly appreciated by Delphox, Rotom, and Vaporeon, as well as any Pokemon with answers weak to poison or some way of staying on the field for a long time. Wallbreakers and cleaners such as Magmortar, Comfey, and Passimian appreciate Garbodor's support, being able to either rack up Spikes damage by forcing switches or appreciating that Spikes wears down their answers. Stealth Rock users such as Piloswine, Druddigon, and Rhydon that can get Stealth Rock up against Xatu are good teammates, as Stealth Rock support can help wear it down. Heliolisk and Incineroar are exceptional teammates, as they can take on Golbat and Rotom, which easily Defog on Garbodor and resist Gunk Shot.</p>"

  "Ferroseed": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferroseed is a niche entry hazard setter thanks to its great Eviolite-boosted bulk and defensive typing letting it take on Flying-, Electric-, Water-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Heliolisk, Blastoise, and Whimsicott. Thanks to these qualities, Ferroseed has a lot of opportunities to set up Spikes or Stealth Rock. Iron Barbs lets it get some chip damage on physical attackers such as Togedemaru while also giving it a fantastic matchup against Dhelmise and Blastoise, punishing any attempt of using Rapid Spin. On top of this, Ferroseed has access to many utility moves such as Leech Seed, Protect, and Knock Off to cripple opposing Pokemon. However, its lackluster offensive stats make Ferroseed setup bait for Pokemon like Braviary and Delphox. It also depends on its Eviolite to deal with Pokemon, making it susceptible to Knock Off. Furthermore, its typing makes it vulnerable to Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Incineroar, Passimian, and Magmortar, the first two being some of the best Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ferroseed can run status-inflicting moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Toxic lets Ferroseed wear down Pokemon that might want to switch into it such as Incineroar and Passimian, and Thunder Wave lets it cripple fast Pokemon such as Sceptile and Accelgor, reducing their Speed and making them easier to deal with. However, dropping Protect gives Ferroseed a harder matchup against Pokemon like Passimian and makes it harder to recover HP with Leech Seed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Due to Magic Bounce, Roost, and its natural bulk, Xatu can indefinitely counter Ferroseed while bouncing back entry hazards. It can also do solid damage with Night Shade, guaranteeing a 3HKO if Ferroseed doesn't switch out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Incineroar, Magmortar, and Delphox can take advantage of Ferroseed's passivity and scare it out due to its 4x weakness to Fire. However, Leech Seed paired with Protect can wear them down, while Thunder Wave and Toxic can cripple them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Passimian, Medicham, and Pangoro can threaten Ferroseed due to their powerful STAB moves, and Swords Dance Pangoro can potentially use Ferroseed for setup fodder. However, these Pokemon should be wary of Leech Seed and Protect, especially Medicham, since it can take recoil if High Jump Kick fails to connect. Protect also lets Ferroseed scout what move Choice Scarf Passimian and Choice Band Pangoro want to go for.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Ferroseed should be wary of Pokemon that can use Knock Off, such as Passimian and Incineroar, due to the threat of removing its Eviolite. Without this item, Ferroseed misses out on a lot of bulk. This makes it harder to check and counter Pokemon it can usually deal with, such as Aerodactyl, Rotom, and Steelix.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Golbat and Druddigon can be a nuisance to Ferroseed, preventing it from setting up hazards and using its utility moves. These Pokemon can also switch into Ferroseed and tank Gyro Ball pretty well; however, Golbat doesn't appreciate losing its item to Knock Off.</p>",

      "Defensive Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down opposing Pokemon, making grounded foes take residual damage every time they switch in. Stealth Rock can be run over Spikes if the team cannot afford to have another Stealth Rock setter. Due to its typing, Ferroseed has a great matchup against common entry hazard removers like Rotom and Blastoise, making it one of the best Spikers in the tier. Leech Seed improves Ferroseed's longevity while draining the foe's HP. Protect lets Ferroseed scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon like Passimian while recovering HP if the foe is afflicted with Leech Seed. Knock Off can cripple some potential switch-ins such as Incineroar and Passimian, removing their items. Gyro Ball paired with its terrible Speed lets Ferroseed do decent damage to fast Pokemon like Accelgor and Sceptile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs paired with a Relaxed nature and Eviolite maximize Ferroseed's defensive capacity, letting it take on both physical and special attackers. A Relaxed nature paired with 0 IVs in Speed is needed if Ferroseed runs Gyro Ball to maximize the damage output of this move. Iron Barbs lets Ferroseed whittle down physical attackers and punish Rapid Spin users. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 SpD can be used to allow Ferroseed to take a Choice Specs Focus Blast from Heliolisk and Savage Spin-Out from Vikavolt.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ferroseed should switch into Pokemon it counters like Heliolisk, Togedemaru, and Aerodactyl to force them out. While it is in, it should set up entry hazards or cripple opposing Pokemon with Leech Seed or Knock Off. Protect complements Leech Seed very well, giving Ferroseed another turn of recovery. Protect should be used when facing a possible Choice-locked Pokemon like Passimian to scout the move it wants to go for. Protect should also be utilized to sponge Z-Moves from Pokemon like Aerodactyl, as well as scouting super effective coverage moves, mainly from Comfey and Heliolisk, which would otherwise be walled by Ferroseed. Ferroseed should avoid setting up hazards if its facing Xatu, since Magic Bounce bounces them back. If Ferroseed is running Knock Off, it should be used to remove the foe's item. Ferroseed should be wary of Knock Off, since losing Eviolite heavily hinders its defensive capability and makes it whittled down quickly by the Pokemon it usually counters.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock users like Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Druddigon provide really good support, since they can stack up entry hazards alongside Ferroseed while also checking Fire-type Pokemon. Druddigon is an especially great partner, since it can get up Stealth Rock against Xatu due to its Mold Breaker ability. Similarly, if Ferroseed is running Stealth Rock, Spikes users such as Garbodor and Mega Glalie make good partners to stack hazards. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Blastoise, Vaporeon, and Slowking can check the biggest weakness Ferroseed has, which is Fire-type Pokemon. Blastoise can also provide Rapid Spin support. Fighting-type Pokemon can be huge threats to Ferroseed, so Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom and Mismagius can be great options to support. These Pokemon can also prevent Rapid Spin users from removing hazards. Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel and Aerodactyl can get rid of Ferroseed's best counter in Xatu. Pivot Pokemon such as Passimian, Heliolisk, and Togedemaru appreciate the hazards Ferroseed can provide, forcing their checks to get whittled down more easily. Passimian can take advantage of Defoggers with Defiant while providing a solid check to Incineroar. Setup Pokemon like Delphox, Incineroar, and Mismagius also appreciate the hazards that Ferroseed provides.</p>"

Its Steel typing gives it a few useful resistances, which, in conjunction with its good natural bulk, allows it to set up on many threatening Pokemon such as Garbodor, Sneasel, and Whimsicott. Unfortunately, Klinklang struggles to do anything to sturdy checks like Steelix, Silvally-Steel, and Pyukumuku, which can all hard wall Klinklang due to its lack of coverage options. While Klinklang does have a good number of resistances, it's also weak to a lot of common types such as Fire, Fighting, and Ground; however, it can work around the latter and potentially use Ground-types as setup bait with Magnet Rise.</p>",

      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear boosts Klinklang's Attack by one stage and its Speed by 2 stages, making it a very fearsome sweeper. Gear Grind is Klinklang's main STAB move, which can threaten Substitute users. Return is able to do a good amount of damage to Pokemon that resist Gear Grind, such as Incineroar and Heliolisk, when boosted. Magnet Rise lets Klinklang set up on Ground-types such as Piloswine and, if it isn't carrying Roar or Curse in its arsenal, Steelix. Substitute allows Klinklang to avoid being crippled by status such as burn and paralysis. Wild Charge in conjunction with Electrium Z covers most bulky Water-types that would otherwise wall Klinklang rather comfortably, such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Pyukumuku. Toxic can be used if running Steelium Z; it targets similar targets as Gigavolt Havoc which are frequently seen on balance and stall teams, meaning Klinklang can break past these archetypes a lot easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature let Klinklang hit as hard as possible, and 188 Speed EVs allow Klinklang to outspeed maximum Speed Decidueye. The remaining 68 EVs are dumped into HP for some extra bulk, which makes it a bit easier to set up Shift Gear. Clear Body makes Klinklang avoid stat drops from Intimidate, Parting Shot, and Sticky Web. It is also the only ability with any use because Plus and Minus are useless, since it's rather rare to see any other Pokemon use Plus or Minus. Steelium Z gives Klinklang a very powerful Corkscrew Crash, while Electrium Z in conjunction with Wild Charge targets defensive Water-types that can try to wall Klinklang. Leftovers gives Klinklang a way to recover health and lets it check Comfey and Whimsicott a lot better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to preserve Klinklang for mid- to late-game to pull off a sweep when its checks like Incineroar, defensive Slowking, and Steelix are weakened. Early- to mid-game, it is generally a lot wiser to just attack the opponent's check so Klinklang can sweep later. Once Klinklang's checks are significantly weakened, Klinklang can start to set up with Shift Gear. Use a Z-Move if Klinklang has to avoid recoil damage from Pokemon that typically carry Rocky Helmet like Xatu or have an ability that damages the attacking Pokemon like Garbodor's and Skuntank's Aftermath and Druddigon's Rough Skin in order to stay healthy so it can potentially get another setup opportunity and stay out of range from being revenge killed by a priority move. By virtue of Klinklang's typing and natural bulk, it can pivot in on Pokemon like Whimsicott and Sneasel. Use Magnet Rise against Ground-types that will try to use their STAB moves against Klinklang. Substitute should be set up whenever predicting a status move such as Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Jellicent, Rotom, Druddigon, and Miltank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which force common answers to Klinklang to take a lot of damage, and chip away at Hitmonlee if running Rocky Helmet. Xatu beats Steelix, Ferroseed, and Garbodor and brings in Klinklang with U-turn. In return, Klinklang can set up on Pokemon that can normally answer Xatu such as Sneasel and, if running Magnet Rise, Piloswine. Samurott can easily set up on a lot of common Klinklang answers like Delphox and Incineroar and can also heavily pressure Water-types like Vaporeon to stay healthy, and the combination of Klinklang and Samurott can potentially overwhelm the foe. Jellicent is incredibly bulky and able to take on most Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, which are Pokemon that Klinklang generally struggles against. Scyther can easily bring in Klinklang with U-turn while also being a good answer to common Fighting-types. It can also lure in Steelix and Incineroar and remove their items with Knock Off. In return, Klinklang can beat Ice- and Flying-types for Scyther. Sneasel can Pursuit trap Calm Mind Delphox and remove the items from Incineroar and Steelix to give Klinklang an easier time breaking past them. Whimsicott can pressure Steel-resistant Pokemon like Slowking, Rotom, and Steelix, and, by virtue of its typing, it can also switch in on Fighting-type attacks for Klinklang.</p>"

It is also quite versatile; Choice Specs offers raw power but requires a good amount of prediction, while Fightinium Z sets offer a good amount of utility by setting Spikes and can keep themselves healthy with Recover. However, Accelgor heavily struggles against Poison-type Pokemon such as Garbodor, Golbat, and Weezing. While it excels offensively, its defensive presence is lacking despite its access to Recover due to its bad defensive typing and vulnerability to all entry hazards. As an offensive Spikes setter, Accelgor is overshadowed by Garbodor, which is an easier Pokemon to use thanks to its better defenses and defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulkier set utilizing maximum HP and Final Gambit + Fightinium Z can be used to heavily dent certain Pokemon that counter Accelgor such as Golbat, Garbodor, and Weezing, making it a solid choice as a lure for teams relying on Comfey as a wincon. Hidden Power Psychic could be used on the Choice Specs set to lure in and take out Poison-types if Accelgor's team already has another Spiker like Garbodor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Assault Vest Magmortar can comfortably take any of Accelgor's moves. Delphox can outspeed Accelgor with Choice Scarf, and Wish variants can come in against most of Accelgor's moves barring Bug Buzz. Incineroar can revenge kill Accelgor from full health, since it can take All-Out Pummeling and a Choice Specs-boosted Bug Buzz. Charizard is a notable counter, since it can take anything Accelgor goes for, is immune to Spikes, and can use Accelgor as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Accelgor lacks a move to hit Poison-types for super effective damage, meaning Pokemon like Garbodor, Weezing, and Golbat can easily deal with it. Golbat in particular is problematic because it can stomach any of Accelgor's moves and threaten it with Brave Bird or clear its Spikes with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Defensive Pokemon such as Steelix, Druddigon, Vaporeon, and Mega Audino can usually take any attack Accelgor goes for and can retaliate by attacking it, threatening it with status conditions, or simply healing off the damage. However, Vaporeon and Steelix must watch out for coverage moves, and Druddigon is easy to wear down with Spikes and repeated attacks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Aerodactyl, Vivillon, and Substitute Braviary can all take advantage of Accelgor, especially if it is Choice-locked into Bug Buzz, and threaten it out of battle. Braviary, however, is 2HKOed by Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Accelgor may be fast, but it is vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Heliolisk and Togedemaru. Common priority users such as Comfey, Pangoro, Sneasel, Piloswine, and Absol can easily revenge kill Accelgor if it has been weakened enough.</p>",

Focus Blast allows Accelgor to punish certain switch-ins such as Incineroar, Steelix, Rhydon, and Aerodactyl. Energy Ball is used mainly to deal more damage to Pokemon like Vaporeon, Seismitoad, and Palossand. Spikes heightens Accelgor's offensive presence with chip damage, and it can set Spikes easily thanks to its combined speed and power forcing switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and Choice Specs, Accelgor is decently powerful and becomes the fastest unboosted Pokemon in NU, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Passimian as well as power through threats like Xatu and Druddigon. Sticky Hold ensures it will never lose its Choice Specs to Knock Off or Trick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Accelgor can be used as a lead thanks to its ability to threaten out Passimian leads and begin setting Spikes or fire off a powerful attack. Due to its paltry defenses, Accelgor should never be brought in against a direct attack. Instead, bring Accelgor in by a pivot, if a teammate has been knocked out, or with an aggressive double switch. If you predict that the opponent will bring in a Pokemon that can take Bug Buzz like Garbodor, Rhydon, Steelix, or Palossand, it is best to either go for one of Accelgor's coverage moves or continue setting Spikes. Keep Accelgor as healthy as possible so it can potentially clean late-game once its checks are removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinners such as Blastoise and Dhelmise pair well with Accelgor, since they can clear entry hazards without removing the Spikes it sets. Xatu in particular is an excellent partner, since it can beat Steelix one-on-one and still provides excellent hazard control. Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Druddigon, and Steelix can form a hazard stacking core with Accelgor. Rhydon can also help deal with bulky Flying-types like Golbat and Substitute Braviary and Fire-types such as Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar if Accelgor has locked itself into the wrong move. Pivots like Passimian, Togedemaru, and Incineroar can help bring Accelgor into battle safely. Passimian can also check Rock-types, while Togedemaru can check Golbat and Substitute Braviary. Psychic-types like Sigilyph, Delphox, and Slowking can help Accelgor deal with Poison-types. Delphox can even help provide Wish support for Accelgor, and Sigilyph appreciates the Spikes support given it forces many switches itself. Slowking provides Future Sight support, which prevents Poison-types from pivoting in against Accelgor or else they risk getting hit hard.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Accelgor is a good Spikes setter thanks to its amazing speed and good offenses that often allow it to force switches against Pokemon it outspeeds and threatens such as Choice Scarf Passimian, Sceptile, and Heliolisk. Bug Buzz threatens Pokemon such as Alolan Exeggutor, Sneasel, and Slowking while 2HKOing Xatu after Stealth Rock and dealing decent damage to Dhelmise and Decidueye. Focus Blast powered up by Fightinium Z allows Accelgor to punish Steel- and Rock-type switch-ins such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Aerodactyl. Recover is mainly used to heal Accelgor on forced switches and scout for what move Choice Scarf Passimian goes for.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Speed investment makes Accelgor the fastest unboosted Pokemon in NU, allowing it to outspeed the most ubiquitous Choice Scarf user, Passimian, as well as other fast Pokemon like Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Aerodactyl. Fightinium Z allows Accelgor to bypass Focus Blast's shaky accuracy and severely dent Pokemon such as Incineroar, Steelix, and Aerodactyl with All-Out Pummeling, as well as reducing the damage taken by Knock Off. Hydration heals Accelgor from status conditions in the rain, which can help improve its matchups against rain teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Accelgor can be used as a lead because it often forces switches and from there begin setting Spikes or fire off a powerful attack. It can also wallbreak at any point in the game or even clean late-game if its checks and counters are gone. Because of Accelgor's less-than-stellar defenses and defensive typing, bring it in by a pivot, if a teammate has been knocked out, or with an aggressive double switch. Make sure that entry hazards are cleared, since Accelgor will be constantly switching in and out of battle. Use Recover when you predict the foe will switch out their Pokemon or to scout for what move Passimian locks itself into. Try to save Accelgor's Z-Move for a Pokemon it can lure into battle and remove that normally can take Bug Buzz, such as Magmortar, Braviary, or Steelix.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Rapid Spin user such as Blastoise or Dhelmise is recommended when using Accelgor, since they not only clear entry hazards for it but also don't clear its Spikes. Blastoise can also help keep Fire-types in check for Accelgor. Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Druddigon, and Steelix can form a hazard stacking core. Rhydon can also help deal with bulky Flying-types like Golbat and Substitute Braviary and Fire-types such as Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar if Accelgor has locked itself into the wrong move. Setup sweepers like Comfey, Sigilyph, and Incineroar appreciate Accelgor's Spikes chipping certain Pokemon to make their time sweeping easier. Incineroar also appreciates Accelgor threatening Rhydon and keeping faster foes in check. Comfey also likes Accelgor removing Steelix and Incineroar so it can sweep later on. Other offensive Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Braviary appreciate Accelgor's ability to lure in and beat Pokemon that wall their STAB moves, such as Rhydon, Incineroar, and Steelix.</p>"

  "Druddigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Druddigon is a special utility Pokemon due its ability to get up Stealth Rock up versus Xatu because of Mold Breaker. Its mono-Dragon typing allows it to resist Water-, Electric-, Grass-, and Fire-type moves, which, when combined with its great bulk, can help it take care of the bigger threats in the tier, such as Magmortar, Incineroar, and Heliolisk. While slow, Druddigon is faster than a number of other Stealth Rock setters such as Steelix and can use Taunt on them to shut them down. Druddigon also benefits from a massive Attack stat, letting it run a more offensive set to function as both a utility Pokemon and a solid wallbreaker. However, Druddigon's poor Speed tier, which means it is outrun by a lot of the tier, along with lack of reliable recovery makes it easy to wear down and takes a big toll out of Druddigon, especially when it's not running Leftovers. This mediocre longevity also means that it is forced to rely on teammates like Vaporeon and Audino to remain healthy with Wish support. Even Druddigon's mono-Dragon typing leaves it susceptible to frequent Ice- and Fairy-type moves, which allows top-tier threats such as Sneasel, Mega Glalie, Comfey, and Whimsicott to easily wear it down or KO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rough Skin paired with Rocky Helmet allows Druddigon to heavily chip physical Pokemon such as Passimian and Incineroar. Generally, though, this makes Druddigon more vulnerable to Xatu, thus losing its niche. Roseli Berry can also be run to take a Fairy-type attack as well as hit something hard with Iron Head or Gunk Shot in return, but this is for the most part a waste of a moveslot and item slot for a one-time attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Prominent Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott usually force Druddigon out. Comfey can also use it as setup fodder, since they are immune to Dragon Tail, which is why it is important to run a status move. Mega Audino reliably comes in and walls this set due to being immune to Dragon Tail and having Heal Bell to get rid of status that was potentially spread throughout the opponent's team. Furthermore, all of these can completely negate Devastating Drake from offensive variants.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Offensive Ice-types such as Mega Glalie and Sneasel can easily OHKO or do massive damage to Druddigon with their respective STAB moves. Piloswine also doesn't generally care about status and can proceed to set up Stealth Rock and dish out massive damage with Icicle Crash.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Swords Dance Incineroar, Choice Band Aerodactyl, and Pangoro take advantage of Druddigon's lack of physical bulk and can easily OHKO or 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic wears down Druddigon easily, since it doesn't have reliable recovery. Burns render this set useless due to an Attack decrease.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is the basic utility Druddigon needs to wear down opposing Pokemon that come in, and it wears down Ice-types effectively, which Druddigon has a weakness to. Mold Breaker also allows Druddigon to set it up against Xatu, which makes up much of its niche. Toxic is run to wear down Pokemon and rack up more damage over time, which helps in the long run against Pokemon such as Piloswine, Comfey, and Xatu. Glare is able to incapacitate fast Pokemon such as Sneasel and Sceptile and Choice Scarf users such as Delphox and Passimian without fail. Earthquake is mainly for Steel-types such as Silvally-Steel, allowing Druddigon to punish its Defog, and Electric-types, which cannot be paralyzed by Glare. Earthquake is also useful due to Mold Breaker allowing it to hit Rotom and Vikavolt and its ability to weaken most Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon and Steelix. Protect with Leftovers makes Druddigon a much more sustainable Pokemon, allowing to get recovery it may need in the long run. It also allows Druddigon to scout Choice item users, such as Passimian and Heliolisk. Dragon Tail is used to phaze other Pokemon to rack up damage with Stealth Rock. This move also forces out potential setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Slowking and Swords Dance Incineroar, which makes Druddigon less passive then other entry hazard setters. It can also run Taunt over Glare to prevent opposing Stealth Rock from being set up by Pokemon such as Steelix or setup from slower Pokemon like Slowking, but this doesn't end up always being reliable due to Druddigon's lack of Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature let Druddigon check Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Magmortar effectively. Alternatively, Maximum HP and Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Druddigon to maximize its physical bulk to better take on physical attackers such as Passimian, Incineroar, and Cinccino. Leftovers gives Druddigon the longevity it needs, since it doesn't have reliable recovery, giving several opportunities to switch into Pokemon such as Delphox, Magmortar, and Sceptile. Rocky Helmet is able to rack up chip damage onto Pokemon like Incineroar, Passimian, and potential spinners. Mold Breaker is to ensure that Druddigon can set up Stealth Rock against Xatu and potentially cripple it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Druddigon should be used early-game to set up Stealth Rock as its primary goal. Stealth Rock can always be set up quickly unless a Taunt user is on the field, as Druddigon is unbothered by Xatu's Magic Bounce. It's in your best interest to start spreading status to fast, frail Pokemon, such as Comfey and Sceptile, after getting the chance of getting Stealth Rock up to get any necessary chip needed for future turns. It is also used to check Pokemon it answers by virtue of its defensive typing and special attackers such as Slowking, Delphox, and defensive Incineroar, and it can take advantage of these Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock. Dragon Tail prevents setup from threats such as Swords Dance Incineroar, Calm Mind Delphox, and Swords Dance Decidueye while also being able to get important chip damage on them. This can also be used to get chip damage on wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeggutor switching in on a predicted Stealth Rock. Taunt gives Druddigon the option to shut down other slower Stealth Rock such as Steelix or Palossand, while also being able to get up its own Stealth Rock and potentially crippling it with status. Druddigon can also pressure entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Steel and Rotom and even cripple them with Glare or Toxic. It can also pressure spinners with chip damage from Rocky Helmet and status and really force the opponent to think twice before using Rapid Spin. Scald burns can basically render Druddigon useless, so it's important to be wary of that.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally, you want to have something to cover Druddigon's weaknesses. Fire-types like Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar cover all of Druddigon's relevant weaknesses, and in return Druddigon even covers their weakness to Water-type moves. Another option would be pairing Druddigon with a cleric such as Vaporeon, with the two of them covering each other's weaknesses, or Mega Audino, which is a much bulkier Pokemon with Regenerator before it Mega Evolves, and both of these Pokemon also have access to Heal Bell, which gets rid of being weakened by status and getting worn down so easily. Adding a Spikes setter such as Garbodor or Accelgor can be another option, since Xatu easily gets worn down by Druddigon, and Spikes also synergize with Dragon Tail well. You can also pair Druddigon with a slow wallbreaker, since it is able to cripple faster Pokemon with Glare, with Pokemon such as Dhelmise, Guzzlord, and even Clawitzer having a nice pairing with this Pokemon. Silvally-Steel has great synergy with Druddigon, as they both cover each other's weaknesses while Silvally-Steel also has a pivot option to get Druddigon back in. Reliable Fairy-type checks such as Garbodor and Golbat are nice options, as they serve as a safe switch-in most of the time. Setup sweepers and breakers such as Mismagius, Sceptile, and Delphox also appreciate Stealth Rock always being on the field, weakening foes like Incineroar and Vaporeon, as well as other defensive answers to breakers.</p>"
      },
      "Dragonium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mold Breaker Stealth Rock bypasses Xatu's Magic Bounce. Devastating Drake has great power and is Druddigon's main tool for OHKOing Pokemon such as Assault Vest Slowking, Dhelmise, Vikavolt, and specially defensive Garbodor; it also still deals severe damage to bulkier Pokemon such as Blastoise and Golbat. Outrage is still plenty strong in its own right, though it should be used sparingly after expending the Z-Move. Earthquake provides perfect neutral coverage alongside Outrage as well as a low commitment attack to throw out. It also smacks entry hazard setters such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Regirock for solid damage and hits other targets such as Rotom, Incineroar, and Weezing. Taunt can stop Stealth Rock from opposing Rhydon, Steelix, Regirock, and Palossand as well as status inflicting, boosting, or healing attempts from walls such as Weezing, Scrafty, and Vaporeon. Glare generally cripples most Pokemon and can slow down and potentially trip up faster entry hazard removers such as Golbat, Blastoise, and Whimsicott with full paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature maximizes power, allowing Devastating Drake to OHKO neutral targets like Assault Vest Slowking, Dhelmise, Vikavolt, and specially defensive Garbodor. Maximum Speed EVs let Druddigon Speed tie with opposing offensive Druddigon while outrunning the likes of Alolan Exeggutor, Weezing, bulky Garbodor, and Rhydon. Mold Breaker allows Druddigon to set up Stealth Rock against Xatu and lets Earthquake hit Levitate users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Druddigon is a powerful Stealth Rock user that is also difficult to OHKO, providing a strong immediate offensive advantage. Use Devastating Drake to OHKO bulky Pokemon such as Slowking, Dhelmise, and Vikavolt or heavily dent the likes of Vaporeon, Blastoise, Scrafty, and Golbat. It could also just be used to wipe out nearly any opposing offensive Pokemon, as very few can hope to survive this attack. Taunt and Glare are primarily used in situations involving entry hazards, preventing opposing Stealth Rock from being set up or your own Stealth Rock from being cleared, though they can be used for other purposes, such as crippling walls or offensive Pokemon. Longevity is less of a priority; Druddigon should focus on setting up Stealth Rock and then wallbreaking or crippling as much as it can, though it can occasionally put its bulk and resistances to use by checking certain Pokemon and threatening them with Devastating Drake, a super effective Earthquake, or Glare.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragonium Z Druddigon makes for a natural fit on offensive teams due to the powerful offensive momentum it generates while also offering decent bulk to fall back on if need be. Partners that can check or revenge kill Pokemon that threaten Druddigon are particularly appealing teammates. Incineroar can check Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Comfey, while its Dark typing allows it to prevent Defog from Whimsicott. However, keep in mind Incineroar would not have access to a Z-Move to aid its wallbreaking. Sigilyph, Vivillon, and Comfey can take out powerful Fighting-types such as Medicham and Pangoro, which are some of the few Pokemon able to OHKO Druddigon with a neutral hit. Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius can spinblock to preserve Druddigon's Stealth Rock while also being able to handle Golbat, Blastoise, and Dhelmise. Druddigon is unlikely to beat bulkier Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon, Steelix, and Regirock one-on-one, though it could Taunt them to give them less leeway. Pokemon that can take out those Stealth Rock users, such as Sceptile, Samurott, Pangoro, Alolan Exeggutor, and Dhelmise, can help to pick up the slack. Slower wallbreakers such as Incineroar, Pangoro, Medicham, and Samurott appreciate Glare support, whereas offensive Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Choice Scarf Passimian, Sceptile, and Mega Glalie can take advantage of Druddigon's wallbreaking capabilities opening up sweeping opportunities for them.</p>"

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>Braviary can effectively perform the role of a wallbreaker or late-game sweeper thanks to its access to utility moves like Bulk Up and Roost, above average bulk, and great Attack. In addition, its great coverage between just Brave Bird and Superpower leaves it walled by very few Pokemon, meaning it can be very difficult to answer defensively. Braviary can also provide great support for its team, since its ability Defiant dissuades and punishes the use of Defog. Additionally, the sheer special bulk of the Substitute + Bulk Up set lets Braviary check Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott as well as other special attackers like Guzzlord and Accelgor. Unfortunately, Bulk Up variants of Braviary are easy to check defensively with Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix and rely on moves that cut into their longevity, leaving them more easily revenge killed. Braviary also deals with a weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting the number of turns it can safely switch in before having to recover with Roost and thus providing the foe with a free turn. Faster offensive Pokemon like Heliolisk and Mega Glalie also give Braviary problems, as they can easily take advantage of Braviary's lesser Speed and OHKO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Braviary can utilize Choice Scarf to become an effective revenge killer and pivot, although such a set lacks the wallbreaking power of the Z-Move set and the defensive presence of the Substitute + Bulk Up set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types and Steelix</strong>: Rhydon dislikes taking repetitive uses of Superpower, but it can boost alongside Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary with Swords Dance and takes little from even +6 Brave Bird. Steelix can also boost alongside Braviary with Curse, making it even more difficult to reliably beat one-on-one, or phaze boosted Braviary with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom resists or is immune to all of Braviary's commonly run moves and threatens to either burn it with Will-O-Wisp or heavily damage it with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Heliolisk can hit Braviary behind Substitute with Hyper Voice, while Choice Scarf Heliolisk threatens to outspeed and KO offensive Braviary variants with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock causes Braviary to waste turns recovering health rather than boosting or firing off attacks, and it can lead to Braviary being in bad matchups against Pokemon like Heliolisk.</p>",

      "Offensive Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is a strong Flying-type STAB attack with the ability to blow past even the sturdiest of physical walls with the help of Bulk Up and Flyinium Z. Superpower rounds out Braviary's coverage well, hitting most Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon for at least neutral damage. Alongside Fightinium Z, it gives Braviary a more reliable way of dealing with these Pokemon itself. Bulk Up enables Braviary to become either a fearsome wallbreaker or sweeper while also making it difficult for traditional revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Passimian, to defeat. Roost provides Braviary with a source of recovery and lets it potentially take advantage of weaker, resisted moves like Torterra's Wood Hammer to gain opportunities to switch in as well as stay healthy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature improve Braviary's offensive presence and let it outspeed Pokemon like Decidueye and Samurott. Defiant lets Braviary deter the use of Defog and Parting Shot, granting it an Attack boost whenever it switches into either move. Fightinium Z gives Braviary a better matchup against Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhydon, Klinklang, and Steelix, although All-Out Pummeling has much worse neutral coverage than Supersonic Skystrike. Alternatively, Flyinium Z allows Braviary access to an extremely strong Supersonic Skystrike that lets it break walls such as Vaporeon and Druddigon and prevents it from taking recoil damage. However, it leaves Braviary with no reliable way to manage Rock- and Steel-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Braviary is best used early- and mid-game to wallbreak for its teammates with its boosted attacks. Braviary gets good opportunities to set up against Pokemon like Torterra, Palossand, and non-Toxic Mega Audino that are incapable of threatening it. Additionally, Braviary can use Roost to repeatedly take advantage of and switch into these Pokemon. However, Braviary can instead opt to just fire off unboosted attacks at switch-ins to weaken them for later, as Brave Bird and Superpower hit incredibly hard even unboosted and doing so lets Braviary more effectively wallbreak mid- to late-game with its Bulk Up-boosted attacks. Braviary should save its Z-Move for Pokemon such as Steelix, Vaporeon, and Weezing that can severely punish Braviary for not OHKOing them. If no opportunities to safely use Bulk Up present themselves, Braviary can try to get an Attack boost by switching into Defog from the likes of Decidueye, Golbat, and Silvally-Steel. However, be careful of switching into Rotom, as it outspeeds Braviary and can punish it with Will-O-Wisp or super effective damage. When using Fightinium Z, Braviary can break Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix and Rhydon much more reliably for its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Braviary appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Steelix and Garbodor, as it assists Braviary in breaking defensive switch-ins such as Rotom and Rhydon. Braviary can even act as a form of entry hazard control, since Defiant deters the use of Defog. Late-game cleaners like Comfey, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Klinklang appreciate Braviary's ability to wallbreak early- and mid-game. Pivot support from the likes of Heliolisk, Rotom, and Silvally-Steel goes well alongside Braviary, since it helps Braviary switch in safely. Heliolisk and Rotom in particular work well with Braviary, since they commonly draw in special walls like Druddigon and Slowking that Braviary can easily defeat. Pokemon such as Steelix and Torterra are excellent partners for Braviary, since they can easily switch into faster Electric-types for it and also can dispatch of Rock-types. Similarly, Fire-types like Incineroar and Magmortar help to deal with faster Ice-types such as Sneasel and Mega Glalie. Since Rotom is a massive problem for Braviary, checks to it like Incineroar, Heliolisk, and Sneasel make for excellent teammates.</p>"

      "Substitute + Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute prevents Braviary from being badly poisoned by Pokemon such as Blastoise, Xatu, and Mega Audino and lets Braviary take advantage of passive Pokemon like Seismitoad and Silvally-Steel that cannot break Substitute easily. Bulk Up lets Braviary function as a late-game sweeper and makes it difficult for physical revenge killers such as Sneasel, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Choice Scarf Braviary to successfully defeat it. Brave Bird is Braviary's best STAB option due to its great neutral coverage, which prevents Braviary from ever being completely walled. Roost provides Braviary with a source of recovery and lets Braviary make use of its solid special bulk to switch into certain hits like Sceptile's Leaf Storm and Whimsicott's Energy Ball. Roost also lets Braviary PP stall attacks such as Steelix's Heavy Slam and Garbodor's Gunk Shot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>96 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are crucial so that Braviary outspeeds Jolly Incineroar and most Xatu, while 252 HP EVs prevent Braviary's Substitute from being broken by Miltank's Seismic Toss. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense and make it more difficult for weak Scald users like Seismitoad to break Braviary's Substitute. Defiant lets Braviary assist in keeping entry hazards up by dissuading opposing Defoggers from using Defog, since it gives Braviary an Attack boost. It also prevents Silvally-Steel from safely using Parting Shot. Leftovers provides Braviary with passive recovery, meaning it doesn't have to use Roost as often and regains some of the health lost from using Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Braviary is best preserved for late-game, as it will struggle to defeat its checks before they are adequately worn down or removed, and it must be healthy to reliably set up. However, Braviary can be pivoted into certain special attacks like Sceptile's Leaf Storm, Alolan Exeggutor's Leaf Storm, and Whimsicott's Moonblast thanks to its good bulk and Roost. Braviary should look to set up Substitute against passive Pokemon incapable of breaking it, such as Palossand, Mega Audino, and Miltank. From there, Braviary can look to use Bulk Up. Although Substitute shields Braviary from status conditions from the likes of Steelix, Vaporeon, and Rotom, it is imperative that Braviary be careful against Golbat. Golbat can badly poison Braviary with Toxic no matter what thanks to its ability Infiltrator. It is also important to keep Braviary at high HP against Choice Specs Heliolisk, as Hyper Voice bypasses Substitute and does a large number.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Rhydon, Steelix, and Garbodor is mandatory in helping wear down Braviary's switch-ins. In particular, Garbodor is an excellent teammate, since Spikes help wear down Rock- and Steel-types for Braviary, while Toxic Spikes synergizes well with Braviary's combination of Substitute and Roost. In return, Braviary assists in keeping hazards up thanks to Defiant. Since Braviary struggles to break Pokemon like Steelix and Rhydon, Pokemon such as Sceptile, Magmortar, and Accelgor help to wear them down. In addition, Accelgor can provide Spikes support for Braviary. Hazard control from the likes of Rotom, Cryogonal, and Silvally-Steel prevents Braviary from being worn down by Stealth Rock damage. Furthermore, these Pokemon can check Heliolisk effectively for Braviary. Pokemon such as Blastoise and Vaporeon are excellent to pair alongside Braviary, as they can switch into physical attackers well. Vaporeon can also provide Heal Bell support for Braviary, while it checks Grass-types for the aforementioned.</p>"

  "Delphox": {
    "overview": "<p>Delphox is a threatening Pokemon in NU due to its high Speed and Special Attack, great offensive typing, and fairly vast movepool that allows it to fulfill a number of roles, including a setup sweeper that breaks through defensive cores, a Wish passer, and a revenge killer that can also clean late-game. While it isn't perfect defensively, Delphox's typing in tandem with its decent bulk gives it the ability to soft check some of the most common special attackers such as Magmortar and Whimsicott as well as Fighting-types like Hariyama and Passimian. Delphox's access to useful coverage moves in Dazzling Gleam and Grass Knot also allows it to bypass a lot of typical Fire-type checks such as Guzzlord, Seismitoad, and Rhydon, and its access to moves such as Calm Mind, Trick, and Wish gives it the ability to support both itself and its teammates. However, Delphox suffers from an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its ability to check the previously mentioned Pokemon consistently. Delphox's typing also leaves it vulnerable to Dark- and Rock-types such as Sneasel, Houndoom, and Aerodactyl as well as their STAB moves in Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Stone Edge.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Substitute + Calm Mind set with Salac Berry can be used to improve Delphox's chances of sweeping more offensive teams while allowing it to avoid status conditions and Pursuit from faster Dark-types, though Delphox doesn't appreciate dropping a move for Substitute. Choice Specs gives Delphox more immediate power at the cost of being unable to alternate between moves while not improving its matchup against faster, more offensive teams like Choice Scarf does.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Houndoom and Incineroar resist both of Delphox's STAB types and are only hit neutrally by Dazzling Gleam; furthermore, both can set up on Delphox with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively. Aerodactyl and Sneasel outspeed non-Choice Scarf Delphox and threaten to OHKO it or trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blastoise can take an unboosted Grass Knot rather well and retaliate with either a strong Scald or Toxic. However, they have a harder time checking Delphox if it has already used Calm Mind or is a Bloom Doom variant.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Rock-types</strong>: Rhydon can easily switch into any move other than Grass Knot from Delphox and threaten it out with Earthquake, while Aerodactyl outspeeds Delphox and OHKOes it with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Certain specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Audino, bulky Incineroar, and Druddigon can handle even boosted attacks from Calm Mind Delphox and either retaliate with strong STAB attacks or put it on a timer with Toxic. Other than Mega Audino, though, they must be wary of switching in on a potential Trick.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Naturally faster Pokemon such as Mismagius and Sneasel as well as faster Choice Scarf users such as Braviary and Passimian outspeed non-Choice Scarf Delphox and threaten to KO it with either strong or super effective attacks. Certain priority users like Decidueye are also capable of revenge killing Delphox, though they can't switch in.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind increases Delphox's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, allowing it break through bulkier teams more easily. Fire Blast is Delphox's main Fire-type STAB move, dealing a lot of damage to non-Fire-resistant Pokemon like Gallade after a boost in power from Calm Mind. Psychic provides Delphox with a secondary STAB move that is more reliable. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam can be used to nail bulkier Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Scrafty, Incineroar, and Druddigon, which would otherwise be a massive annoyance to Delphox. Grass Knot rounds out Delphox's coverage by giving it the ability to threaten bulky Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types such as Palossand, Rhydon, and Slowking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in Speed and Special Attack makes Delphox as strong and as fast as possible, with a Timid nature being used to outspeed foes such as Rotom and Sigilyph. Firium Z turns Fire Blast into Inferno Overdrive, which gives Delphox access to a strong and reliable one-time attack that can be used to break through typical checks like Mega Audino. Alternatively, Grassium Z can be used to turn Grass Knot into Bloom Doom, which is capable of heavily damaging bulky Rock- and Water-types like Rhydon, Slowking, and Pyukumuku even unboosted. Colbur Berry can be used over either Z-Crystal if Delphox's team already has a Z-Move user, allowing Delphox to take Dark-type moves such as Knock Off from Sneasel and Passimian before KOing them with Fire Blast. Fairium Z is another option that can be used to break through Pokemon like Incineroar, but Firium Z and Grassium Z are more consistently threatening for teams to deal with. Blaze increases Fire Blast's power when Delphox is low on HP, which can potentially give it an easier time powering through foes such as Mega Audino with Inferno Overdrive after it uses Calm Mind.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Delphox excels against slower, more defensive teams, avoid playing recklessly against them and letting Delphox acquire too much damage beforehand in order to use it to its fullest potential. If Delphox is not holding a Colbur Berry, it is rather vulnerable to Dark-types and Pursuit trappers, meaning that preserving it until these Pokemon have been removed may prove useful; however, if a teammate needs a certain defensive core broken through in order to reliably sweep late-game, Delphox can be used to wallbreak for them instead. Exercise caution in regard to using Firium Z. It should mainly be used after Delphox has used Calm Mind in order to break through bulkier foes such as Mega Audino and Piloswine or if Delphox really can't afford to miss against foes like Steelix. While Delphox doesn't appreciate taking a lot of damage before it attempts to set up, it is capable of taking resisted special attacks from Pokemon such as Sceptile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Delphox fits well on bulky offensive teams that are in need of a setup sweeper that can break through common defensive cores. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Steelix, Garbodor, and Piloswine is appreciated, as the chip damage gives Delphox an easier time breaking through bulkier Pokemon like Slowking and Incineroar. Due to Delphox's weakness to Stealth Rock, it also appreciates having teammates such as Rotom, Blastoise, and Silvally-Steel that can remove entry hazards. Silvally-Steel can put bulkier foes on a timer with Toxic and make use of Parting Shot in order to pivot Delphox in, while Rotom can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and get Delphox in safely against bulkier Grass-types like Dhelmise with Volt Switch. Delphox's weakness to Dark means that checks to Dark-types are indispensable teammates. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hariyama and Passimian can offensively check Dark-types and wallbreak for Delphox, which they have a much easier time doing due to Delphox removing their checks. Mega Audino can also check Dark-types and come to Delphox's aid against revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Braviary. Additionally, Mega Audino can provide cleric support, which helps in maintaining Delphox's longevity. Sneasel makes for a good teammate due to its ability to pressure bulky Pokemon that Delphox can struggle with breaking through unboosted like Druddigon and Aerodactyl as well as potentially remove Slowking with Pursuit. In return, Delphox can eliminate physically bulky Pokemon that Sneasel can struggle with like Vaporeon and Steelix as well as soft check Fighting-types like Hariyama.</p>"
      },
      "Wish + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish heals Delphox and its teammates, which allows it to reliably use Toxic to stall foes out. Protect guarantees that Delphox will regain HP after using Wish, generates a free turn of Leftovers recovery, forces badly poisoned Pokemon to take an additional turn of damage, and allows Delphox to scout for moves. Mystical Fire is the preferred Fire-type attack, since it lets Delphox prevent Pokemon like Comfey and opposing Delphox from boosting their Special Attack so that they can break through it. Toxic gives Delphox the ability to cripple defensive Pokemon that would otherwise completely wall it such as Rhydon and Slowking as well as more offensive checks like Guzzlord.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>28 Special Attack EVs let Delphox 2HKO Xatu with Mystical Fire after Stealth Rock, while 252 HP EVs enable it to switch into Pokemon like Sceptile and Comfey. The remaining EVs go into Speed alongside a Timid nature so that Delphox can outspeed Mega Glalie. Leftovers gives Delphox a minor form of recovery, which lessens its reliance on Wish. Blaze increases the power of Delphox's Fire-type attack when it is low on HP, though Wish in combination with this set's more defensive nature prevent Delphox from taking complete advantage of it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Delphox should mainly switch in on special attackers that it checks such as Mega Abomasnow and Whimsicott; however, Delphox must be wary of Earthquake from Mega Abomasnow. Using Wish against these Pokemon as well as others like Steelix is ideal, since Delphox forces them out and can safely use Protect on the following turn to regain HP. Against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Guzzlord and Sneasel, use Protect in order to scout which move they lock themselves into and act accordingly. Toxic should be used whenever Delphox anticipates a Pokemon that it cannot otherwise deal with such as Incineroar, Slowking, or Vaporeon to switch in. Be wary of Toxic from Pokemon such as Mega Audino, as it greatly hinders this set and limits Delphox's ability to check Pokemon like Klinklang while still maintaining longevity. Refrain from switching in if Stealth Rock is up, as this heavily pressures Delphox and forces it to use Wish more often than it would like to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish Delphox fits best on bulky offensive and balance teams with teammates that lack recovery and are easier to wear down, as these Pokemon appreciate the support that Delphox provides. Entry hazard removers such as Blastoise, Silvally-Steel, and Whimsicott are important teammates due to Delphox's weakness to Stealth Rock preventing it from switching in and out as freely as it would like if it is up. All three of them can deal with bulky Ground- and Rock-types for Delphox. In return, Delphox can keep these Pokemon consistently healthy with Wish on top of switching into Grass-types. Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Passimian offensively check Dark-types and appreciate Delphox placing pressure on their checks like Vaporeon and Dhelmise. Mega Audino ability to reliably switch into and threaten out most Dark-types is very much appreciated, and it also provides cleric support in Heal Bell to prevent status from hindering Delphox. Bulkier setup sweepers like Comfey and Scrafty appreciate being passed Wishes, as it allows them to break early-game and take chip damage without it being detrimental in their attempt to sweep late-game. Delphox also pressures Steel- and Poison-types, which the two struggle against.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Delphox's strongest Fire-type STAB move, hitting Pokemon such as Sneasel, Steelix, and Whimsicott super effectively. Psychic threatens Fighting- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Passimian, Garbodor, and Golbat, and it also hits certain Fire-resistant Pokemon like Magmortar fairly hard. Psyshock can be used over Psychic to hit Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hariyama and Magmortar harder. Dazzling Gleam gives Delphox super effective coverage for certain Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Scrafty, Guzzlord, and Druddigon and is also useful for hitting foes such as Houndoom and Incineroar neutrally. Alternatively, Grass Knot can be used to hit Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Rhydon, Slowking, and Seismitoad harder than any of Delphox's other attacks. Finally, Trick cripples specially defensive Pokemon that Delphox is incapable of breaking through, such as Slowking and Vaporeon, while also allowing Delphox to switch between moves afterwards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Delphox's offensive presence while making it as fast as possible, with a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf allowing Delphox to outpace the entire unboosted metagame as well as some boosted threats like Shell Smash Omastar. Blaze increases the power of Fire Blast when Delphox is low on HP, which can prove useful when attempting to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Delphox should mainly be used as a revenge killer due to its high Speed and Special Attack, although it is capable of serving as a late-game cleaner as well. Exercise caution when it comes to using Psychic if the opposing team has a Dark-type like Incineroar or Sneasel, since they can switch into Delphox after it KOes a foe and either set up on it as it switches out or remove it with Pursuit. Delphox should mainly switch in on resisted special attacks such as Moonblast from Whimsicott and Fire Blast from Magmortar; however, note that Stealth Rock will limit its ability to handle these attacks. Trick should mainly be used against defensive teams, as losing Delphox's Choice Scarf isn't as detrimental against them compared to offensive teams and it can effectively hamper bulkier Pokemon like Slowking. However, be sure to scout for Z-Moves on Pokemon like Blastoise before using Trick, since it will fail and force Delphox out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Delphox fits well on both offensive and bulky offensive teams that are in need of a way to keep faster foes in check and a powerful revenge killer. Delphox appreciates having teammates that can remove entry hazards due to its vulnerability to all forms of them, most notably Stealth Rock, so Pokemon such as Golbat, Rotom, Silvally-Steel, and Whimsicott are good partners. While Delphox doesn't appreciate entry hazards on its side of the field, it certainly appreciates being paired with entry hazard setters such as Rhydon and Steelix in order to pressure bulkier teams. Since Choice Scarf Delphox can struggle with breaking through certain bulky Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Slowking, it appreciates being paired with wallbreakers that can pressure these Pokemon and make cleaning up late-game easier, such as Heliolisk, Guzzlord, and Passimian. The former two can check Water-types, while the latter checks Dark-types, and Delphox can check Fairy-, Fighting-, and Ice-types for them in return. Setup sweepers that can take advantage of opposing Pokemon being locked into Knock Off and Pursuit such as Comfey, Scrafty, and Klinklang are good teammates, as Delphox appreciates having them to fall back on against the likes of Sneasel and Choice Scarf Houndoom. Scrafty can also set up on other checks to Delphox like Vaporeon and Slowking. In return, Delphox can break through Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Steelix and Dhelmise for them. Mega Audino makes for a good teammate due to its ability to reliably switch into Knock Off, check Dark-types, circumvent Delphox's lack of recovery and vulnerability to entry hazards courtesy of Wish, and provide Heal Bell support in case Delphox is inflicted by status, while Delphox can remove Poison- and Steel-types for it.</p>"

  "Vivillon": {
    "overview": "<p>The combination of its access to Quiver Dance, decent Speed and Special Attack, and good offensive typing makes Vivillon one of the deadliest setup sweepers in NU, capable of threatening offensive and defensive teams alike. Sleep Powder is another factor that contributes to how threatening Vivillon is, allowing it to incapacitate even its hardest checks in Pokemon like Steelix, Silvally-Steel, and Rhydon and proving useful in generating setup opportunities. Furthermore, Compound Eyes increasing the accuracy of Vivillon's moves makes Sleep Powder and Hurricane far more reliable than usual. Vivillon also boasts good coverage in Hurricane + Energy Ball, which is enough to hit the entire tier barring most Steel-types neutrally. However, Vivillon's defensive presence is rather poor due to its typing leaving it 4x weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to common attacking typings in Electric, Fire, Flying, and Ice and its low defenses preventing it from taking neutral attacks well even after using Quiver Dance and leaving it susceptible to priority from the likes of Sneasel and Medicham. Vivillon is weak unboosted, meaning that it will need to accrue a number of boosts in order to break through bulkier Pokemon like Assault Vest Slowking as well as balance teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Endeavor in tandem with Focus Sash can lure in foes like Silvally-Steel as they attempt to OHKO Vivillon, which can pave the way for a teammate that needs these checks eliminated in order to reliably sweep such as Aromatisse, though it isn't as consistent as Vivillon's other options. Hidden Power Ground can be used to lure in and hit Steel-types like Silvally-Steel and Togedemaru super effectively, though Vivillon's other moves tend to be more valuable. An alternative EV spread with 96 EVs in HP, 168 in Special Attack, 4 in Special Defense, and 240 in Speed can be used in order to guarantee that Vivillon takes Ice Shard from Sneasel at full.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Piloswine and Sneasel threaten Vivillon with a super effective Ice Shard, requiring minimal to no chip damage to revenge kill it. Other strong priority moves from Pokemon like Medicham and Decidueye can also pick Vivillon off, though they require Vivillon to take more damage beforehand. However, they can experience problems with revenge killing Vivillon if it is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Silvally-Steel, Probopass, Alolan Sandslash, Klinklang, and Steelix are all capable of checking Vivillon if something else has been put to sleep due to their resilience to Vivillon's attacks, and they have no problem KOing it with their respective STAB moves. Alolan Sandslash can also KO Vivillon through its Substitute with Icicle Spear. Flyinium Z variants are capable of beating the latter two if Vivillon has acquired enough boosts, though.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Variants of Vivillon lacking Energy Ball experience great difficulty dealing with bulky Rock-types such as Rhydon, which in return can easily OHKO Vivillon with their respective STAB moves, with Rhydon even being able to KO Vivillon through its Substitute with Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Vivillon's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock means that it loses 50% of its HP upon switching in if the entry hazard is up, which gives it a harder time setting up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Prior to using Quiver Dance, Vivillon is outsped and pressured out by faster Pokemon like Sneasel, Houndoom, and certain Choice Scarf users like Braviary, with the former also being able to Pursuit trap Vivillon. Other Choice Scarf users like Haunter, Delphox, and Scyther can outspeed it at +1 and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Heliolisk and Rotom resist Hurricane, take a +1 Energy Ball fairly well, and can easily revenge kill Vivillon with either Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Both of these Pokemon outspeed Vivillon prior to it using Quiver Dance, with Choice Scarf Rotom even outpacing it at +1.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance increases Vivillon's Speed, Special Attack, and Special Defense by one stage, which gives it an easier time with sweeping and makes revenge killing it difficult. Hurricane is Vivillon's strongest STAB move and is rather spammable due to its high Base Power and increased accuracy courtesy of Compound Eyes. Energy Ball provides good coverage alongside Hurricane, threatening to hit Rock-types like Rhydon super effectively as well as being a slightly more reliable means of dealing with bulky Water-types like Slowking and Vaporeon. Substitute is an alternative to this, allowing Vivillon to more easily set up on passive Pokemon like Mega Audino and guarding it from status conditions and priority moves. Substitute also lets Vivillon take advantage of the switches it can force, which can reduce its reliance on prediction. Sleep Powder cripples foes by putting them to sleep, allowing Vivillon to create setup opportunities for itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in Speed and Special Attack makes Vivillon as fast as possible while also maximizing its offensive presence, with a Timid nature allowing it to outpace Pokemon like Medicham and Hitmonlee. Substitute + Leftovers variants could invest 16 EVs into HP, which increases the recovery provided by Leftovers and increases the number of times Vivillon can use Substitute. Compound Eyes increases the accuracy of Vivillon's moves, making Hurricane and Sleep Powder a lot more reliable. Flyinium Z turns Hurricane into Supersonic Skystrike, which is very powerful even unboosted and allows Vivillon to break through bulky Pokemon like Mega Audino with a bit of prior damage. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used to provide passive recovery, preventing Vivillon from being worn down too quickly, which Substitute variants in particular appreciate. The fact that it cancels out residual damage taken from hail and sand is also important to note.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Above all else, refrain from switching Vivillon in if Stealth Rock is up, as doing so will cause Vivillon to lose 50% of its HP and leave it incapable of reliably sweeping. Vivillon's lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and poor bulk mean that it should avoid switching directly in on most attacks. However, Vivillon is capable of switching in on Pokemon that are Choice-locked into Fighting-type moves such as Medicham and Braviary. Substitute variants should switch in on Pokemon that Vivillon threatens out like Decidueye lacking priority moves and use Substitute as they switch out, which can allow Vivillon to safely set up or use Sleep Powder. Avoid attempting to set up until all Steel-types have been removed. Bulky Rock-types like Rhydon should also be either heavily weakened or removed entirely if Vivillon lacks Energy Ball. Early-game, Vivillon should prioritize crippling Pokemon with Sleep Powder and using Hurricane, since this can potentially open the door for a teammate or even Vivillon itself to clean late-game. Priority users like Piloswine should also be removed, especially in the case of non-Substitute variants, since they can quickly put an end to Vivillon's sweep after it KOes a foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vivillon's crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock means that pairing it with entry hazard removers such as Blastoise, Whimsicott, Silvally-Steel, and Hitmonlee is near mandatory in order for it to perform its role to the best of its ability. Teammates that can set entry hazards such as Steelix, Piloswine, and Garbodor are also appreciated, as they help Vivillon guarantee certain OHKOs such as on Mega Glalie and 2HKOs such as on Guzzlord at +1. These Pokemon also come to Vivillon's aid against common priority users and appreciate Vivillon offensively checking Fighting- and Ground-types for them. Probopass is also notable, since it can trap and remove Steelix and non-Magnet Rise Klinklang courtesy of Magnet Pull, set Stealth Rock, and make use of a slow Volt Switch to bring Vivillon safely into play. Fighting-types such as Passimian, Medicham, and Hariyama are good offensive partners due to their ability to remove bulky Rock- and Steel-types with their respective STAB attacks as well as pressure other checks to Vivillon like Type: Null, Slowking, and Rotom. Passimian can also bring Vivillon in safely with U-turn. Other wallbreakers that can pressure Steel-types like Heliolisk, Guzzlord, and Magmortar pair well with Vivillon, and it also appreciates their ability to wear down shared checks like Rhydon. Users of U-turn, Volt Switch, and Parting Shot such as Passimian, Heliolisk, Rotom, and Silvally-Steel give Vivillon an easier time with switching in and lure in defensive Pokemon that Vivillon can potentially take advantage of such as Slowking and Mega Audino. Vivillon appreciates having bulky teammates that can easily sponge priority moves like Steelix and defensive Slowking to fall back on, with the former being able to additionally check Flying-types and the latter serving as a secondary check to Fighting-types.</p>"

  "Pyroar": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being the fastest Fire-type NU has to offer, Pyroar has failed to make an impression on the metagame due to its poor non-STAB coverage options and minimal defensive utility. Against Pokemon such as Slowking, Regirock, and Rhydon, Pyroar has to rely on Grassium Z + Solar Beam, whereas other Fire-types have more consistent coverage that can wear down their checks more easily. For reference, Incineroar OHKOes both of them after a Swords Dance boost with either Knock Off or Tectonic Rage, and Magmortar OHKOes defensive Slowking with Thunderbolt-based Gigavolt Havoc, all after Stealth Rock. Bad bulk and a bad defensive typing dissuade it from ever directly switching into anything other than Ghost attacks, whereas Incineroar and Magmortar have Intimidate and a secondary Dark typing for the former and a high Special Defense stat for the latter. We're not lion, Pyroar struggles to distinguish itself from the plethora of other Fire-types NU has to choose from.</p>",

Pyroar should be careful not to waste its all-important Grassium Z, as it heavily relies on said item to break through checks such as Rhydon. Taunt is useful for shutting down non-attacking moves such as Regirock's Stealth Rock, and Breakneck Blitz breaks through Pokemon such as Incineroar and Druddigon it wouldn't be able to get through otherwise.

  "Pangoro": {
    "overview": "<p>Pangoro's high Attack stat, great STAB combination, useful movepool, and ability Iron Fist make it a powerful wallbreaker and late-game sweeper capable of threatening Pokemon like Rhydon, Slowking, and Palossand. Swords Dance allows it break walls like Weezing and Vaporeon as well as sweep late-game with Bullet Punch, KOing revenge killers like Aerodactyl, Sneasel, and Sceptile. Pangoro can also use Choice Band to get an immediate Attack boost, making it a deadly threat right off the bat. However, due to its low Speed, unimpressive bulk, and weaknesses to common attacking types like Fighting and Fairy, it is hard for Pangoro to find an opportunity to set up Swords Dance. For this reason, it faces competition from other wallbreakers like Incineroar and Passimian, which are faster and bring more utility to the table, making them easier to fit them on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake alongside Mold Breaker is an interesting option to hit Weezing super effectively, but it is very situational and slightly decreases Bullet Punch's damage. Gunk Shot can prevent Fairy-types from pivoting into Pangoro as easily; however, Bullet Punch and Zen Headbutt are often preferred, as Bullet Punch provides priority and allows Pangoro to prevent revenge killing from weakened faster threats, while Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types super effectively and provides a good neutral move alongside Pangoro's STAB moves. Ice Punch is decent neutral coverage alongside Knock Off and a Fighting-type move, but it is hard to justify over Bullet Punch or Zen Headbutt. Scrappy is an option to hit Ghost-types even with a Fighting-type move, thus making it more spammable, but the damage output of Bullet Punch will be reduced, which makes Pangoro a less effective revenge killer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types and Fairy-type Moves</strong>: Whimsicott and Comfey can outspeed and OHKO Pangoro with their Fairy-type STAB moves. Several Pokemon also bring Fairy-type coverage, such as Dazzling Gleam from Xatu, Delphox, and Mismagius, which can deal massive damage to Pangoro.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Weezing, Garbodor, and Golbat can all take Pangoro's powerful Fighting-type moves, although they all dislike Zen Headbutt and Knock Off. Weezing's amazing physical bulk allows it to take several hits and burn Pangoro, Garbodor can take at least a hit and retaliate with Gunk Shot or heavily cripple Pangoro with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage, and Golbat can outspeed Pangoro and threaten it with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types such as Passimian and Medicham can outspeed Pangoro and OHKO it with their powerful Fighting-type STAB moves. Passimian should be wary of Chople Berry Pangoro, which can survive a Close Combat, but Medicham, Gallade, and Sawk can still OHKO Pangoro through Chople Berry.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Sigilyph and Vivillon can both outspeed Pangoro, KO it with their Flying-type STAB moves, and take several Fighting-type moves, meaning they are able to come in on a Fighting-type move and set up or throw off a powerful hit. Aerodactyl can also outspeed and threaten Pangoro, although it should be wary of a boosted Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Passimian, Sceptile, and Braviary are examples of fast attackers that can threaten to OHKO Pangoro with their powerful moves. They can offensively pressure Pangoro by coming in on it after it has claimed a KO or through offensive double switches and force it out, creating momentum and minimizing opportunities for it to throw off a powerful hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Pangoro's Attack to dangerous levels, improving its wallbreaking abilities without being locked into a move. Knock Off is Pangoro's Dark-type STAB move that has the added effect of removing the foe's item such as Weezing's Rocky Helmet and Passimian's Choice Scarf. Drain Punch is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move due to its ability to recover Pangoro's health while having no drawbacks, and it is quite strong at +2. Bullet Punch gives Pangoro a form of priority, allowing it to act as a late-game sweeper after a Swords Dance even if faster threats like Aerodactyl and Whimsicott are around, and provides a way for Pangoro to hit Fairy-types super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs and an Adamant nature improve Pangoro's offensive capabilities. Chople Berry allows Pangoro to take a Close Combat from Passimian. Life Orb is an option to improve Pangoro's power, but Chople Berry's utility is generally preferred. Iron Fist boosts Drain Punch and Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Knock Off whenever possible, especially early-game. There is no drawback to using it, as it can help scout for Z-Moves and remove important items. Pangoro's bulk is not very good, so it should be brought out through pivots, through double switches, or after a teammate has fainted. Pangoro doesn't find many opportunities to set up Swords Dance due to the amount of offensive Pokemon that can revenge kill it by taking advantage of its low Speed. Thus, Swords Dance should only be used if Pangoro is up against a naturally forced out foe like Slowking or Steelix or a Pokemon that cannot do much damage to Pangoro like Palossand. If the opponent still has a Pokemon that can revenge kill Pangoro, thus stopping its sweep, like Passimian or Whimsicott, make sure they are in range of +2 Bullet Punch. Use Drain Punch if Pangoro is low on health to make revenge killing it harder. Swords Dance Pangoro does amazingly against slow, bulky teams, so keep it healthy for a sweep in that matchup. Pangoro struggles to set up versus offensive teams, however, so it is usually better off just attacking and weakening the opposing team due to their general lack of reliable switch-ins to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots like Passimian and Togedemaru can bring Pangoro in safely. Entry hazard support is greatly appreciated, allowing Pangoro to plow through even Unaware walls. Stealth Rock users like Rhydon, Druddigon, and Steelix do the job nicely, as Rhydon and Steelix can cover Pangoro's weakness to Flying, and the latter can also cover Fairy-types. Spikes and Toxic Spikes users like Weezing, Garbodor, and Accelgor also work well; the former two can help against Fairy- and Fighting-types, while Final Gambit Accelgor can also KO Weezing and Garbodor. Fast attackers like Heliolisk and Sceptile can ease the matchup against fast offensive teams and enjoy Knock Off support, allowing them to break through checks more easily and particularly appreciating Passimian's Choice Scarf being removed to stop it from revenge killing them. Other late-game sweepers like Comfey and Vivillon appreciate Pangoro's ability to wallbreak. Comfey particularly enjoys Pangoro weakening Poison-types, and Vivillon enjoys Rock- and Steel-types weakened.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Pangoro's most spammable move due to its lack of drawbacks and ability to remove items. Superpower is Pangoro's strongest Fighting STAB move, but the stat drops make Pangoro easier to revenge kill and pivot into. Hammer Arm is an alternative to Superpower that doesn't reduce Pangoro's Attack and Defense while maintaining the same power, but it leaves Pangoro vulnerable to revenge killing by slower Pokemon like Alolan Exeggutor and offensive Rhydon. Drain Punch lets Pangoro heal itself while still doing a decent chunk of damage. Bullet Punch is a form of priority that allows Pangoro to pick off weakened revenge killers like Passimian, Aerodactyl, and Whimsicott, slightly compensating for its low Speed. Zen Headbutt targets Poison-types like Weezing, Garbodor, and Golbat for super effective damage and hits Fairy-types like Whimsicott for neutral damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside an Adamant nature and a Choice Band allows Pangoro to be as strong and fast as possible, outspeeding walls like Vaporeon and Dhelmise. Iron Fist boosts the power of some of Pangoro's moves, improving Pangoro's offensive capability. A Jolly nature can be opted for to outspeed opposing Pangoro and Speed tie with Scrafty, but the higher damage output is usually preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pangoro's bulk and Speed are not very good, meaning it struggles a lot against offensive teams, so it generally should be switched in through pivoting, after a teammate has fainted, or on moves that Pangoro is resistant or immune to from the likes of Rhydon and Choice-locked Sneasel and Sigilyph. Avoid letting it get chipped down as well. Use Knock Off whenever Pangoro gets on the field if the opponent has a Ghost- or Poison-type like Decidueye or Weezing, as this weakens them gradually and removes their items, allowing Pangoro to use its Fighting-type moves more freely late-game. Pangoro should use Drain Punch to recover its health should it be low on health from residual damage from pivoting in. Use Bullet Punch to clean up a weakened team or revenge kill a foe. Make sure to put Pokemon in range of Bullet Punch by laying entry hazards and spamming Knock Off early-game. Pangoro does well against slower and bulkier teams due to its great offensive presence and Speed advantage, so try to keep it healthy against such teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch like Passimian, Xatu, Decidueye, and Heliolisk are great partners that can bring Pangoro in safely. Passimian can also form a threatening Fighting-type core with Pangoro that aims to wear down checks by means of entry hazards, pivoting, and strong attacks. Heliolisk benefits from Pangoro's Knock Off threatening checks like Dhelmise. Pangoro also appreciates Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Steelix and Weezing. Steelix can also help with Flying-types and set up Stealth Rock, and Weezing can check Fighting-types and pressure Pangoro's switch-ins with Toxic Spikes. Entry hazard users like Rhydon, Druddigon, and Garbodor are good partners to help chip down Pangoro's checks. Garbodor covers Pangoro's Fairy weakness, and Rhydon helps with Flying-types. Druddigon can slow down checks like Passimian with Glare, making them easier to deal with. Late-game sweepers like Vivillon and Comfey are decent teammates. Vivillon appreciates Rock-types pressured, Comfey can pressure Poison-types alongside Pangoro, and both enjoy Steel-types pressured. Pangoro can also remove items like Iapapa Berry from Incineroar, Eviolite from Golbat, and Leftovers from various defensive Pokemon. In return, they can also offensively check Fighting-types.</p>"

  "Aromatisse": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to its good offensive typing, access to Trick Room to mitigate its rather low Speed, and access to Nasty Plot to augment its already decent Special Attack, Aromatisse is capable of performing as an effective late-game sweeper that can pose a threat to offensive and defensive teams alike. Aromatisse's typing is solid defensively as well, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hariyama, Sneasel, and Malamar. This, in combination with its good mixed bulk, gives it an easier time setting Trick Room. Decent coverage in Psychic also allows Aromatisse to deal with Poison-types that would otherwise put a damper on its attempts at sweeping. However, Aromatisse suffers from rather average overall stats, which often forces it to use both Trick Room and Nasty Plot in order to begin sweeping. While good defensively, its pure Fairy typing unfortunately burdens it with weaknesses to Poison- and Steel-type attacks, both of which are fairly common in NU. Aromatisse will often have to take a hit before setting Trick Room for itself, which can be problematic versus stronger attackers such as Mega Glalie, and its susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards making it easier to wear down only makes matters worse.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers is a viable alternative to Fairium Z if the team Aromatisse is on already has a Z-Move user that gives Aromatisse a form of passive recovery, since passive damage is one of Aromatisse's greater annoyances. Life Orb can also be used over Fairium Z if the team Aromatisse is on already has a Z-Move user, although the recoil damage it has to take as a result of this is unappealing and wears it down faster. Aromatisse has access to other coverage moves such as Energy Ball and Thunderbolt, although a lot of what these other moves hit already doesn't appreciate switching in on a +2 Moonblast. A physically defensive set with Wish / Protect / Moonblast / Aromatherapy could be used to make Aromatisse into a cleric, but Aromatisse faces competition in this role from Mega Audino, which boasts greater bulk and Regenerator prior to Mega Evolution. A set of Calm Mind / Moonblast / Rest / Sleep Talk can turn Aromatisse into a bulky late-game sweeper for balanced and stall teams, although such as a set faces competition from Type: Null.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing resist Moonblast and can take an unboosted Psychic before dishing out a super effective Poison-type attack in response.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Steelix, Silvally-Steel, Klinklang, and Probopass all take an unboosted Twinkle Tackle and threaten Aromatisse out with their respective STAB attacks. Klinklang and Steelix don't appreciate taking +2 Twinkle Tackle, however, while Probopass doesn't want to switch in on Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Type: Null and Assault Vest Slowking can both take even +2 Twinkle Tackle, with Type: Null being able to use Rest to recover any lost HP and Slowking being able to switch out and regain a bit of lost health due to Regenerator. Both can also deal decent amounts of damage to Aromatisse with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Aromatisse not having room for any kind of recovery, it is worn down by residual damage from entry hazards, Toxic, and weather, which can prove annoying against stronger attackers, since Aromatisse usually has to take one hit before being able to set up Trick Room.</p>",

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room is a major part of what makes Aromatisse a good late-game sweeper, allowing it to take advantage of its low Speed by outspeeding almost all of the tier under it. Nasty Plot augments Aromatisse's Special Attack, giving it an easier time breaking and sweeping through teams. Moonblast is Aromatisse's strongest Fairy-type attack, hitting Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types such as Sneasel, Altaria, and Hariyama for super effective damage. Psychic offers coverage to combat Poison-types such as Garbodor and Golbat that would otherwise give it difficulties. Hidden Power Fire is also an option, targeting both Steel-types such as Klinklang and Silvally-Steel. Hidden Power Ground is another alternative that can be used to target Fire-types such as Delphox and Magmortar on top of the aforementioned Steel-types, although most Fire-types are easier to wear down, and Houndoom and Incineroar are neutrally hit by Moonblast.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in both HP and Special Attack maximizes Aromatisse's bulk and offensive presence. A Quiet nature further augments Aromatisse's power while also helping it outspeed as much as it can under Trick Room. Aroma Veil is the preferred ability due to it preventing Aromatisse from being disrupted by Taunt and Encore from the likes of Mismagius and Whimsicott. Fairium Z turns Moonblast into Twinkle Tackle, which is fairly strong even unboosted and allows Aromatisse to bypass some of its checks at +2, such as Delphox and Klinklang.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Aromatisse excels as a late-game sweeper, it should wait until Pokemon it cannot break through such as Silvally-Steel have been either weakened enough or removed entirely to begin its sweep. While Aromatisse's bulk is good, it shouldn't be recklessly switched in on attacks when it doesn't have to, as this cuts into its longevity. Furthermore, being weakened limits Aromatisse's ability to find setup opportunities. Aromatisse should mainly set up on Pokemon that are Choice locked into Dark- or Fighting-type attacks such as Sneasel and Braviary, as well as on Dragon-types such as Druddigon. After setting up Trick Room, Aromatisse should aim to use Nasty Plot in order to increase its damage output and become more threatening. However, against frailer, offensive teams, this may not always be necessary. Exercise caution when it comes to using Aromatisse's Z-Move. It should mainly be used to KO Fairy-resistant foes that can take a +2 Moonblast or to break through very specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aromatisse appreciates wallbreakers that can place pressure on specially bulky Pokemon such as Assault Vest Slowking and Mega Audino, so Pokemon such as Mega Glalie, Sceptile, and Alolan Exeggutor make for good partners. Entry hazard support from the likes of Rhydon and Steelix is appreciated, since the chip damage wears down Aromatisse's switch-ins; the previously mentioned examples can also check Poison-types for Aromatisse, while it can deal with Fighting-types for them. Entry hazards can also lessen the need to use Twinkle Tackle against certain Pokemon, allowing Aromatisse to save it until it is more important. Pivots such as Probopass, Rotom, and Xatu are good teammates, since they can get Aromatisse in safely against the likes of Sneasel and ease setup. Rotom and Xatu can provide useful entry hazard removal, while Probopass can trap Steel-types. On more dedicated Trick Room teams, other Trick Room setters such as Mega Audino and Alolan Exeggutor are good partners, as they alleviate some of the pressure placed on Aromatisse to set up. Alolan Exeggutor can also wallbreak for Aromatisse and Mega Audino can provide useful Healing Wish support, all of which give Aromatisse an easier time sweeping. Slow wallbreakers such as Aggron, Hariyama, and Vikavolt appreciate Aromatisse offering them Trick Room support to improve their matchup against offensive teams. In return, they break many of the Pokemon that Aromatisse finds itself struggling with such as Silvally-Steel.</p>"

By utilizing Rest and Sleep Talk, it can switch into and set up against Pokemon such as Blastoise, Vaporeon, and Steelix that rely on status to shut down offensive Pokemon. However, Malamar is weak before boosting and slow, and although it has few weaknesses, its typing doesn't grant it many resistances either, offsetting some of the benefits its defensive utility provides. Additionally, strong wallbreakers such as Whimsicott, Medicham, Pangoro, and Accelgor can overwhelm it before it gets a chance to set up. Malamar also needs a lot of team support to function, and it tends to be quite inconsistent because of the ubiquity of its checks. Therefore, it only fits on teams tailored to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Malamar can use Z-Happy Hour to give it a boost to all of its stats, potentially making it more immediately threatening. However, it is still outpaced and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Togedemaru after a boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bug-type Coverage and Bug-types</strong>: Pokemon with U-turn such as Passimian and Choice Scarf Togedemaru can threaten Malamar out of battle because of its low Defense before boosting and its nasty weakness to Bug-type moves. Swords Dance Samurott is also notable because it can easily OHKO Malamar with Savage Spin-Out before setting up. Bug-type Pokemon such as Vikavolt and Accelgor fear very little from Malamar's moves, can outspeed it in Accelgor's case, and can OHKO Malamar before it has the chance to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Comfey and Whimsicott can take any move Malamar goes for and retaliate with their own STAB moves. Comfey can even set up Calm Mind in front of Malamar and recover damage it takes with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Medicham, Pangoro, Flyinium Z Aerodactyl, Poisonium Z Garbodor, and Mega Glalie can overwhelm Malamar by outspeeding it and exploiting its weaker Defense before it has a chance to boost with Superpower.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower acts as an offensive Bulk Up thanks to Contrary. It also hurts Dark-types such as Incineroar, Pangoro, and Sneasel for super effective damage. Knock Off is Malamar's best form of damage against Poison-types like Weezing, Garbodor, and Golbat as well as Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Slowking, Rotom, and Xatu. Rest enables Malamar to take advantage of certain defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Weezing, and Vaporeon by healing itself of status conditions that would normally shut down other offensive Pokemon. Sleep Talk prevents Malamar from being passive after it uses Rest, allowing it to potentially continue boosting with Superpower while bypassing the move's low PP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The following EV spread with a Careful nature gives Malamar an easier time setting up against Pokemon like Slowking and Blastoise. Contrary reverses stat drops, allowing Malamar to set up with Superpower and pressure Defog users by gaining an evasion boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Malamar should be used late-game as a wincon once its checks and counters are gone. However, it can also spam Knock Off early-game to cripple checks so they're less effective at stopping it late-game. Malamar can be brought in against Pokemon like Slowking, Seismitoad, and Weezing and begin setting up. This is because Malamar can heal status conditions such as Scald burns and Toxic poison and continue boosting its stats with Rest and Sleep Talk so it can combat Pokemon like Blastoise, Vaporeon, and Slowking. If Malamar has sustained a lot of damage in battle, use Rest to bring it back to full health so it can consistently check Pokemon like Rotom and Delphox.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Malamar fits best on teams that are built specifically around it, since it requires unique support to function consistently. Steelix is an ideal partner for Malamar, as it can threaten the Fairy-, Bug-, and Poison-types that threaten Malamar and pressure physically offensive Pokemon like Sneasel and Aerodactyl, giving Malamar an easier time setting up. In return, Malamar can check special attackers like Slowking and pressure Xatu, allowing Steelix more free rein to set Stealth Rock. Spikes setters such as Garbodor and Ferroseed also pair well with Malamar, since it pressures Defog users thanks to Contrary, which can help keep Spikes on the field. Garbodor can also blanket check Fighting- and Fairy-types as well as U-turn users such as Decidueye and Choice Scarf Togedemaru. Weezing is another Pokemon that works well with Malamar, as it can punish U-turn spam with its Rocky Helmet, and Toxic Spikes wears down checks to Malamar like Whimsicott and Comfey.</p>"

Its access to coverage moves in Dark Pulse and Aura Sphere solidifies Clawitzer's role as a wallbreaker, letting it hit a huge portion of the metagame for great damage. Clawitzer also has access to a slow U-turn and forces a lot of switches, allowing it to safely bring in teammates. However, Clawitzer is held back by the abundance of excellent Grass-types in the tier such as Whimsicott, Decidueye, and Sceptile. Moreover, its low Speed stat leaves it vulnerable to most faster powerful attackers in the tier, especially because its bulk is rather average. Clawitzer also faces competition from other Water-types in Samurott and Blastoise, which both sport a better Speed tier, outspeeding Pokemon like Omastar. Samurott also can bluff physical sets and pull off a mixed set, while Blastoise provides immense team support thanks to Rapid Spin and Refresh.</p>",

Vaporeon must, however, be wary of Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Water Pulse is Clawitzer's main STAB move, as it hits very hard with Mega Launcher. It also comes with a decent confusion chance. Scald is an alternative if Water Pulse's extra power is not desired, and it can be used to spread burns to weaken Clawitzer's checks instead. It also is still powerful enough to OHKO Piloswine. Dark Pulse rounds Clawitzer's coverage well, nailing the bulky Water-types that otherwise wall it, namely Vaporeon and Slowking. Ice Beam is its main way of dealing with Grass- and Dragon-types, hitting the likes of Alolan Exeggutor and Druddigon for super effective damage. Aura Sphere lets Clawitzer OHKO Scrafty and hits Cryogonal and Audino for good damage. U-turn can be used to take advantage of Clawitzer's ability to force many switches, allowing it to get it teammates onto the field safely and pivoting out of its checks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed with a Modest nature and Choice Specs let Clawitzer hit hard and outpace much threats as possible. Mega Launcher boosts the damage of Water Pulse, Dark Pulse, and Aura Sphere.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Clawitzer to tear apart opposing cores early-game, leaving them weakened for the rest of the team to clean up. Since this set is holding a Choice item, it is very prediction-reliant. Water Pulse should almost always be used to wear the opposing team down provided that opponent doesn't have a Pokemon immune to it, but you should also try to predict what Pokemon the opponent will send out and use the appropriate coverage move. Predicting wrong comes with very big risks, however, as it could cost the team's momentum or end up giving Pokemon like Comfey setup opportunities when Clawitzer is locked into a move like Dark Pulse. When using U-turn, first consider if safely bringing a teammate on the field would bring more momentum than Clawitzer firing off attacks on its own.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot support from the likes of Whimsicott, Passimian, and Silvally-Steel is excellent for safely bringing Clawitzer into the field, and Clawitzer can even complete a VoltTurn core with them if it opts to run U-turn. Switch-ins to Electric- and Grass-types are needed, and Grass- and Electric-types of your own work well, such as Dhelmise and Vikavolt, as they also eliminate bulky Water-types for Clawitzer. Entry hazard support helps Clawitzer in its job, as it nets a 2HKO on Vaporeon after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Rhydon and Piloswine fit well as Stealth Rock setters, and Garbodor is a good Spikes setter, as it also checks Grass-types for Clawitzer. Faster revenge killers and naturally fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Passimian and Delphox help cover Clawitzer's low Speed stat, and they appreciate Clawitzer's ability to break past their checks.</p>"

      "Substitute + Toxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute helps Clawitzer stall opposing Pokemon with Toxic and avoid getting revenge killed and statused by common Pokemon such as Passimian and Vaporeon. Toxic helps chip down opposing Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Seismitoad, and Vaporeon and pairs well with Substitute. Water Pulse is Clawitzer's STAB move and allows it to quickly break down opposing Pokemon while stalling them down via Toxic. Lastly, Dark Pulse does solid damage to Slowking and Vaporeon. Ice Beam is an alternative to Dark Pulse to hit Pokemon such as Torterra, Druddigon, and Whimsicott super effectively at the cost of missing out on beneficial damage on the aforementioned targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment increases Clawitzer's damage output. 156 Speed EVs let Clawitzer outspeed various threatening Toxic users such as Vaporeon and Blastoise, giving it a chance to use Substitute effectively. The remaining EVs are put into HP to improve Clawitzer's bulk. Mega Launcher boosts Water Pulse's and Dark Pulse's damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Substitute versus passive Pokemon like Vaporeon and Blastoise, as they are the easiest to get a Substitute off on. Additionally, try to keep entry hazards off the field because chipping Clawitzer can prevent it from using Substitute at some point. Additionally, Clawitzer lacks reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, so try not to let it get hit by Knock Off. Be wary of clicking Toxic versus teams with Xatu and Steel-types like Silvally-Steel, as Xatu can easily bounce back Toxic using Magic Bounce, while Steel-types are immune to Toxic. However, you can ease up on this if Clawitzer is behind a Substitute. Keep in mind that you should be clicking Toxic versus bulkier Pokemon that Clawitzer doesn't do as much damage to, such as Cryogonal and Audino. Lastly, try to make use of pivoting moves such as Parting Shot, U-turn, and Volt Switch to help get in Clawitzer safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Electric-types such as Decidueye and to Ground-types such as Sceptile are pivotal for Clawitzer, as Electric-types heavily threaten Clawitzer if it is not behind a Substitute. Heliolisk especially is problematic, as it can damage Clawitzer with Hyper Voice even if it is behind a Substitute. Grass-type checks such as Incineroar, Mega Glalie, and Braviary benefit Clawitzer, as it cannot easily deal with the likes of Decidueye and Golbat without Ice Beam or Substitute. Entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Xatu and Cryogonal is also helpful for Clawitzer, as repeated chip damage will easily prevent Clawitzer from doing its job. Pokemon such as Incineroar and non-Grassium Z Delphox that aren't the biggest fans of bulky Water-types appreciate Clawitzer's support, as it deals with such Pokemon easily. Spikes setters like Ferroseed and Garbodor are also great partners for Clawitzer, as Spikes ease the process of Toxic stalling for Clawitzer quite a bit. Finally, pivot support from Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Iapapa Berry Incineroar, Passimian, and Silvally-Steel is useful for Clawitzer, as they are able to bring it in safely.</p>"

Heliolisk is also one of the tier's best offensive pivots because of its access to a strong Volt Switch, which is hard to stop due to Heliolisk's impressive coverage in moves such as Hyper Voice, Surf, and Focus Blast. Because of the aforementioned factors, Heliolisk can easily avoid most forms of direct damage and pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Due to Dry Skin, Heliolisk is able to switch into Water-type moves and regain HP, making it the tier's premier bulky Water-type exploiter. However, Heliolisk's bulk is rather poor, especially physically, which makes it harder to switch in on weaker, resisted attacks and on defensive Water-types such as Slowking due to its access to Psyshock. While Heliolisk's Speed tier is solid, it is still outsped and forced out by Pokemon such as Sneasel and Whimsicott. Heliolisk is reliant on its item for its damage output, with Choice Specs variants being locked into one move, which can lead to them being taken advantage of by Pokemon like Dhelmise and Steelix depending on which move it locks into.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heliolisk can make for a decent user of different Z-Moves such as Fightinium Z, Normalium Z, and Electrium Z, as each give it the ability to bypass some of its harder checks without the drawback of recoil damage. However, Heliolisk is much weaker without the boost in power from Choice Specs, becoming unable to 2HKO foes such as Druddigon. Dark Pulse can be used to deal with Dhelmise without forcing Heliolisk to switch out as well as to take on Rotom, Dhelmise, and Decidueye; however, Heliolisk's other coverage moves tend to be more useful. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit certain checks such as Torterra and Alolan Exeggutor for 4x effective damage, but Heliolisk doesn't appreciate dropping a move for it. Choice Scarf allows Heliolisk to outspeed some of its offensive checks like Sceptile, Choice Scarf Passimian, and +2 Klinklang, but Heliolisk will be much weaker than when using a Life Orb and lose out on its ability to alternate between moves. Thunder is an option if Heliolisk is on a rain team, although its shaky accuracy hurts its reliability when rain is not active.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: While Heliolisk is powerful, it has problems with breaking through certain specially bulky Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hariyama, Dhelmise, and Decidueye.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can naturally outspeed Heliolisk such as Sneasel and Whimsicott are capable of dealing heavy amounts of damage to it with their respective STAB attacks, with Sneasel being able to Pursuit trap Heliolisk.

Thunderbolt can be used instead to give Heliolisk a stronger Electric-type attack against Pokemon like Vaporeon that doesn't force it to switch out. Surf deals with Rhydon and Steelix, and it also threatens Fire-types like Incineroar and Delphox. Dark Pulse provides Heliolisk with coverage for Decidueye and Dhelmise, which resist its STAB combination and could otherwise switch in with ease. Focus Blast can be used to hit Pokemon that otherwise wall Heliolisk such as Ferroseed and Togedemaru and as well as let it hit targets such as Guzzlord and Silvally-Steel harder than any of Heliolisk's other coverage moves. Grass Knot is an option that still retains coverage against the likes of Piloswine and the aforementioned Rhydon as well as Seismitoad; however, this causes Heliolisk to lose out on coverage for Pokemon such as Delphox and Magmortar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in Speed and Special Attack maximizes Heliolisk's offensive presence and Speed, with a Timid nature allowing it outspeed Pokemon such as Delphox and Sigilyph.

However, Heliolisk must be wary of other attacks from the previously mentioned Water-types such as Psyshock, Megahorn, and Toxic, respectively. Choice Specs is significantly increases its damage output, letting break through bulkier Pokemon with ease at the cost of locking Heliolisk into one move at a time. Alternatively, Life Orb increases Heliolisk's damage output as well; it does, however, cause Heliolisk to take damage with every attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heliolisk is mainly a wallbreaker, although it can also clean late-game due to its high Speed and Special Attack. Due to Heliolisk's average bulk, it should never take hits when it doesn't need to, as this wears it down even faster and will prevent it from effectively breaking. The ideal ways to get Heliolisk in are after a teammate is KOed or through the use of Parting Shot, U-turn, or Volt Switch. However, Heliolisk can switch into a predicted Water-type moves from Pokemon like Vaporeon and Slowking because of Dry Skin and generate momentum with Volt Switch. Predicting Electric-immune foes to switch in and using the appropriate coverage against them is ideal, as this will allow Heliolisk to more reliably use Volt Switch mid- or late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Garbodor, Steelix, and Rhydon are good partners, since the entry hazards are good for pressuring Heliolisk's switch-ins, allowing it to break them more easily. In return, Heliolisk pressures Xatu, an absolute roadblock for them. Garbodor and Qwilfish are also capable of acting as Fighting-type checks for Heliolisk. Entry hazard control from the likes of Silvally-Steel and Xatu is also important, since it prevents Heliolisk from taking additional damage from entry hazards on top of recoil from Life Orb. Fire-types such as Delphox, Incineroar, and Magmortar appreciate Heliolisk switching into Water-type attacks for them and can break through defensive Grass-types in return. Fighting-types such as Medicham and Passimian are capable of pushing through a lot of the specially defensive Pokemon that Heliolisk finds itself struggling with and appreciate Heliolisk getting them in against these Pokemon for free with Volt Switch. Checks to Fighting-types such as Slowking, Weezing, and Xatu are also rather useful, since most Fighting-types can take one hit and KO Heliolisk in response. Other pivots such as Braviary, Passimian, and Silvally-Steel pair well with Heliolisk, as they complete a VoltTurn core and keep both pressure and momentum going.</p>"

  "Aurorus": {
    "overview": "<p>A strong Ice-type STAB move in Blizzard and good Special Attack complemented by good coverage in Freeze-Dry and Earth Power make Aurorus a threatening wallbreaker. Its great offensive pressure and ability to beat nearly all of NU's entry hazard control options one-on-one mean that Aurorus can easily find space to set up Stealth Rock. However, despite its good natural bulk, its low Speed and exploitable typing, including weaknesses to Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks, means Aurorus is easily forced out. Additionally, despite being a Rock-type, Aurorus struggles to defensively check Flying-types such as Aerodactyl and Sigilyph, which can leave teams based around it in a tough spot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs increases Aurorus's power even further, letting it OHKO Blastoise after Stealth Rock damage, although it requires far more prediction than other sets. Rock Tomb can be used over Earth Power or Protect to beat Articuno, vastly improving Aurorus's matchup against stall teams as well as slowing down faster foes on a switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Delphox, Magmortar, and Incineroar resist Aurorus's Ice-type moves and threaten it with powerful coverage attacks such as Grass Knot, Focus Blast, and Earthquake; however, they all are easily chipped by hail, and need to fear Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Mega Audino, Assault Vest Slowking, Piloswine, and Wish Delphox all take minimal damage from most moves Aurorus can use and threaten to badly poison it with Toxic, or hit it with strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Passimian, Medicham, and Gallade all outrun and OHKO Aurorus, but they struggle to switch in on Blizzard. Hariyama takes almost nothing from any attack Aurorus can use and threatens to OHKO it with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Although they cannot switch in easily, Pokemon such as Sceptile, Togedemaru, Passimian, and Aerodactyl can threaten to OHKO Aurorus with their super effective attacks.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Aurorus's strongest, most spammable STAB move, thanks to a lack of reliable Ice-resistant Pokemon in NU, as well as Snow Warning giving it perfect accuracy. Freeze-Dry hits Water-types such as Blastoise and Vaporeon for 2HKOs, providing good coverage when combined with Blizzard. Stealth Rock is essentially mandatory for any competitive team, and Aurorus finds ample opportunities to set it thanks to the number of switches it forces. Earth Power hits Fire-types such as Incineroar and Delphox for heavy damage, as well as OHKOing Togedemaru. Protect can be used to scout what move Choice item Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Passimian and Togedemaru will lock themselves into, vastly simplifying play against them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment, a Modest nature, and Icicle Plate combine to maximize Aurorus's power, letting it 2HKO walls such as Vaporeon with Freeze-Dry. Maximum Speed investment is needed to Speed tie with Adamant Pangoro as well as outrun Pokemon such as Rhydon, Dhelmise, and Vaporeon. Snow Warning is Aurorus's ability of choice, raising Blizzard's accuracy to 100% while providing valuable chip damage against foes such as Slowking, Incineroar, and Delphox.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Blizzard is a very low-drawback move thanks to its high Base Power and good neutral coverage as well as the lack of durable Ice-resistant Pokemon in NU. Freeze-Dry should be used when a Water-type is expected to switch in, letting Aurorus bypass Vaporeon, Slowking, and Blastoise with minimal risk to itself. Stealth Rock should be used as early as possible, against forced switches, or against a Pokemon such as Weezing that cannot threaten Aurorus. While Aurorus does have usable bulk, it should not be brought in recklessly, especially considering its lacking resistances; its poor speed means it will often need to take a hit before using an attack of its own, so keeping it at high HP is paramount. Protect should be used when against a Pokemon holding a Choice item such as Passimian or Aerodactyl; depending on the move that they lock into, Aurorus may be able to stay in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types such as Incineroar and Delphox appreciate Aurorus weakening Water-types such as Vaporeon and Blastoise. Pursuit support from Absol or Sneasel can help to remove Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Delphox and Slowking. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Rotom and Dhelmise let Aurorus avoid taking damage from Stealth Rock. Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Slowking and Weezing are necessary when using Aurorus given its heavy weakness to Fighting-type attacks. Passimian draws in and pivots on targets such as Weezing, Dhelmise, and Slowking, all of which Aurorus can threaten, while taking on Incineroar. Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Togedemaru and Rotom make good partners, as Aurorus does not match up well against most Flying-types in NU.</p>"

  "Decidueye": {
    "overview": "<p>Decidueye is a potent wallbreaker thanks to Nasty Plot letting it break past even checks like Incineroar and Garbodor with Z-Moves. Decidueye's able to use its good defensive typing, recovery in Roost, and bulk to switch into Pokemon like Heliolisk and Slowking to set up and stay healthy. Additionally, Decidueye can provide further utility to teams via U-turn and Defog. Unfortunately, Decidueye's Speed tier is average at best, leaving it outsped and revenge killed by threats like Rotom, Delphox, and Sigilyph. Decidueye is also easily Pursuit trapped by Aerodactyl, Sneasel, and Absol because of this. Furthermore, Decidueye struggles to break past Incineroar without prior chip damage, and its Defog sets are much more passive than its Nasty Plot one.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Decidueye can run a physically offensive set with Swords Dance / Spirit Shackle / Leaf Blade / Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch, a Jolly nature with maximum Attack and Speed investment, and a Z-Crystal like Grassium Z or Decidium Z to become a dangerous sweeper that can deal with faster threats thanks to its access to priority moves like Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. However, this set is reliant on boosts and a Z-Crystal to beat its checks, many Pokemon like Garbodor, Golbat, and Choice Scarf Passimian are not thwarted by Decidueye's priority moves, and there are more threatening Z-Move sweepers in the tier such as Swords Dance Incineroar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Golbat can easily switch into anything Decidueye throws at it and recover lost health with Roost, remove entry hazards with Defog, or OHKO offensive Decidueye with Brave Bird. Other Poison-types like Garbodor, Weezing, and Silvally-Poison can switch into Decidueye's Grass-type attacks well, but they fail to take +2 Never-Ending Nightmare.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar is both one of the most common Pokemon in NU and one of Decidueye's best checks due to its bulk and typing. Although it can be removed by a boosted Z-Move, it's generally able to switch into Decidueye and force it out. Other Fire-types like Delphox and Magmortar are faster than Decidueye and threaten to OHKO it with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Sneasel and Absol outspeed Decidueye and threaten to OHKO or Pursuit trap it. Guzzlord easily takes anything Decidueye has to offer and can easily remove it with Dark Pulse. Scrafty's bulk lets it take most attacks from Decidueye and set up afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Braviary trivially uses Decidueye as setup fodder and easily dispatches of it with Brave Bird. Aerodactyl outspeeds and KOes or Pursuit traps Decidueye. Other faster Flying-types like Sigilyph and Vivillon can also come in on Decidueye's Grass-type attacks and remove it with their Flying-type attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot can be used to capitalize on the switches that Decidueye forces and lets it OHKO Pokemon such as Weezing and Vikavolt with a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare. Shadow Ball hits Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Xatu for heavy damage while offering good neutral coverage against Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing. Leaf Storm is Decidueye's strongest attack, with great coverage against top-tier threats such as Slowking, Rhydon, and Heliolisk while being Decidueye's best option against Pangoro. Energy Ball or Giga Drain can be run over it, but their lacking initial power hurts Decidueye's mid-game power. Roost is used to keep Decidueye healthy, letting it come in many times a game against foes such as Heliolisk, Blastoise, and Slowking and set up against Weezing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Timid nature are required to outrun Incineroar, Adamant Garbodor, Blastoise, and Xatu. Maximum Special Attack gives Decidueye the power needed to threaten opposing Pokemon, such as OHKOing Palossand and Steelix after a Nasty Plot boost. Ghostium Z can be used to turn Shadow Ball into Never-Ending Nightmare, which lets Decidueye OHKO foes such as Weezing, Garbodor, and Vikavolt after a Nasty Plot. Grassium Z-boosted Leaf Storm is Decidueye's strongest possible attack and can OHKO Pangoro without needing a Nasty Plot boost while guaranteeing an OHKO on Incineroar after a Nasty Plot and one round of Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Decidueye set should be brought in as many times as possible against bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, defensive Slowking, and Vaporeon, as it fears very little from them. While it does resist Ground, be more careful against Rhydon and Steelix, and try to bring Decidueye in when predicting them to set up Stealth Rock. Decidueye can also be brought in against Blastoise or Seismitoad to heal with Roost. Despite carrying Nasty Plot, Decidueye is often best off attacking with Leaf Storm or Shadow Ball, which hit hard enough to often OHKO foes without needing a boost. However, if the opponent is running Pokemon such as defensive Garbodor and Weezing that take little damage from Shadow Ball or Leaf Storm, Decidueye should use Nasty Plot and then aim to OHKO them with Never-Ending Nightmare. Be careful with the timing of Decidueye's Z-Move; Never-Ending Nightmare should be used after a Nasty Plot to OHKO foes such as Weezing, Garbodor, or a slightly weakened Incineroar, while Bloom Doom should be used to lure in and OHKO Pokemon such as Pangoro.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pangoro, Passimian, and Comfey greatly appreciate this set luring in and KOing Poison-types such as Weezing and Garbodor for them. The former two also heavily threaten Incineroar, one of this set's biggest roadblocks. Rhydon, Guzzlord, and Blastoise all wall and force out Incineroar, and given that this set generally allows Incineroar in, they make great teammates. Aerodactyl is a great teammate, bringing in Water-types such as Blastoise, trapping Delphox with Pursuit, and easily cleaning weakened teams after Decidueye wallbreaks. Aerodactyl also traps Sigilyph and Rotom, both of which can revenge kill Decidueye. Stealth Rock and Spikes users such as Steelix and Garbodor also pair excellently with this set, as it excels at blocking Rapid Spin from Blastoise and Dhelmise. Stealth Rock support is especially helpful for putting Incineroar into range of a +2 Bloom Doom and giving a +2 Never-Ending-Nightmare good odds to OHKO it.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Decidueye is a good user of Defog because it can pressure entry hazard setters such as Rhydon, Steelix, Seismitoad, and Palossand with Grass Knot. Roost keeps Decidueye healthy throughout the match so it can continue to pivot in against Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Medicham. U-turn lets Decidueye exit the battle from bad matchups such as against Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar. Giga Drain can be used instead to give Decidueye an extra form of recovery and can potentially get it out of KO range from Slowking's Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread and a Colbur Berry, Decidueye can take two Knock Offs from Passimian and is able to pivot in and out of special attackers such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Comfey. It can also survive Pursuit from Sneasel and more or less get out of the battle with U-turn. 16 EVs in Speed allow Decidueye to outspeed maximum Speed Rhydon. Long Reach allows Decidueye to pivot out with U-turn without being punished by Xatu and Garbodor's Rocky Helmet. Leftovers is also a viable item on this set to give Decidueye more passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Decidueye should aim to clear entry hazards as soon as possible, but make sure that Toxic Spikes are cleared first, as being afflicted with bad poison hinders its solid bulk. In order to get Decidueye into battle, it is advised to bring it in against a Pokemon it is not immediately threatened by such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Passimian locked into Close Combat. It can also come in against common Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Palossand as they are setting up entry hazards. This play can be risky, though, because Rhydon, Palossand, and Steelix can threaten Decidueye with heavy damage. Since Decidueye can usually force these Pokemon out of the battle, it can be a good idea to use Roost if it has taken prior damage or U-turn to escape from Grass-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar, Sceptile, and Togedemaru.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Incineroar, Mega Glalie, and Braviary appreciate Decidueye's ability to clear entry hazards and beat Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon and Seismitoad. Incineroar can also form a U-turn core with Decidueye and check Ice- and Grass-types for it, while in return Decidueye can help beat Water-types for Incineroar. Grounded Poison-types like Garbodor can help clear Toxic Spikes for Decidueye. Garbodor also appreciates Decidueye's ability to beat Stealth Rock setters. Decidueye can also form VoltTurn cores with Pokemon like Passimian, Heliolisk, and Rotom. Passimian can also help Decidueye beat Dark-type Pokemon like Sneasel, while Rotom can help beat Ghost-types like Dhelmise. In return, Decidueye can beat Ground-types for Rotom and Heliolisk, letting them use Volt Switch more often. Pokemon like Rhydon, Togedemaru, and Sneasel appreciate Decidueye's immunity to Fighting-type moves. Bulky Water-types like Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blastoise can help keep Fire-types at bay. Vaporeon can also use Heal Bell to heal Decidueye of status conditions.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm can easily pressure Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon and Seismitoad, which is why Decidueye makes a good offensive Defogger. Roost heals Decidueye if it has taken prior damage and allows it to stay healthy so it can keep pivoting or using Defog if needed. U-turn allows Decidueye to pivot out of Pokemon like Dhelmise and bring in a teammate that can deal with said threat. Shadow Ball can also be used with Ghostium Z to threaten Pokemon like Weezing, Druddigon, Garbodor, and Vikavolt, but it leaves Decidueye helpless against Pokemon like Braviary and is difficult to justify considering how important Decidueye's other moves are.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Decidueye to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. Colbur Berry allows Decidueye to take at least one Knock Off or Pursuit from users such as Incineroar, Passimian, and Sneasel and pivot out immediately. Grassium Z is the preferred offensive item on this set, since it makes Decidueye a lot more effective at checking Pokemon like Steelix and Slowking, and even has the added bonus of OHKOing Pangoro from full health . It also bypasses Leaf Storm's Special Attack drops. Miracle Seed can be used instead to give a boost to Leaf Storm without recoil, as Miracle Seed-boosted Leaf Storm puts Assault Vest Slowking in range of U-turn, putting it in an even tougher position. It also threatens to OHKO Piloswine, Regirock, Vaporeon, and Blastoise, OHKO Pangoro after U-turn, and 2HKO Steelix. Overgrow is the preferred ability so Leaf Storm can be boosted in a critical moment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Decidueye should aim to clear entry hazards as soon as it can and avoid Toxic Spikes at all costs. It should aim to come in against Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon, bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Blastoise, or Pokemon that are of no immediate threat to it like Heliolisk. However, be cautious if Rhydon goes for Stone Edge instead of Stealth Rock expecting Decidueye to come in and clear Stealth Rock. Decidueye's Z-Move should be saved to heavily dent certain foes such as Steelix, Slowking, and Pangoro. After it has forced out a Stealth Rock setter, Decidueye can recover with Roost, clear hazards with Defog, or use U-turn to pivot out of battle against a bad matchup such as against Magmortar, Weezing, and Togedemaru. Because this set does not use Long Reach, be cautious of using U-turn against Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Weezing.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Decidueye fits best on teams that need an answer to Stealth Rock setters while also removing entry hazards. Pokemon like Magmortar, Delphox, and Sneasel appreciate Decidueye's ability to provide Defog support, beat Stealth Rock setters, and bring them in safely with U-turn. In return, these Pokemon can beat other Grass-types and, in Magmortar and Delphox's case, Steel-types that resist Decidueye's Leaf Storm. Garbodor is also a good partner for Decidueye because it can clear Toxic Spikes for Decidueye. In return, Decidueye can beat bulky Ground-types. Water-types such as Slowking and Vaporeon also beat Fire-type Pokemon for Decidueye. Flying-types such as Braviary, Vivillon, and Sigilyph can help Decidueye beat other Grass-types. In return, Decidueye can beat Rhydon and Steelix for these Pokemon. Other pivots such as Rotom, Vikavolt, and Choice Scarf Passimian can form a pivoting core with Decidueye. Passimian is especially noteworthy, since it can also beat Dark-types for Decidueye. Rotom and Vikavolt, meanwhile, can help deal with Flying-types for Decidueye. Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Incineroar, Alolan Exeggutor, Comfey, and Pangoro appreciate Decidueye's U-turn, which allows them to enter the battle safely.</p>"

  "Incineroar": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Incineroar's great Attack, incredibly wide movepool containing many support and coverage options, and ability Intimidate, it is a very flexible Pokemon in the NU metagame, being able to function as either a potent wallbreaker or a useful pivot. High base Attack and wide coverage make Incineroar one of NU's most potent offensive threats, which is only boosted by its access to the exclusive Z-Move Malicious Moonsault, which lets it OHKO nearly any Pokemon that doesn't resist it after a Swords Dance boost. A good defensive typing and great defensive stats combined with Intimidate mean that Incineroar has the natural bulk to take on Fire-, Ice-, and Dark-types. Intimidate also allows it to function as a very useful pivot, increasing its physical bulk, and helping it to support its team. Incineroar is also the best setup Pokemon under dual screens, as its defensive utility combined with the increased bulk of dual screens gives Incineroar a very easy time accruing multiple boosts. However, a weakness to passive damage and no recovery moves means that it is easily worn down, which, combined with its low Speed stat, leaves it easily revenge killed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band makes Incineroar immediately stronger while still letting it provide pivot support with U-turn at the cost of significant longevity. Groundium Z lets Incineroar OHKO Pokemon that resist its Dark-type attacks, such as Hariyama and Guzzlord, after a Swords Dance, as well as OHKOing Pokemon such as Rhydon, which can normally take a Malicious Moonsault. Firium Z allows Incineroar to OHKO Passimian on the switch; however, its usage must be timed extremely well. Taunt allows Incineroar to bypass Pyukumuku and generally improves its matchup against stall, but giving up a valuable coverage move allows foes such as Passimian and Hariyama to come in for little risk. Rest and Sleep Talk can be used with Bulk Up and a move of choice, such as Power Trip, to turn Incineroar into a late-game sweeper; however, the lack of utility early-game and the reliance on a singular attack make this set unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon such as Rhydon generally can take a hit from Incineroar and threaten it back with super effective attacks and Stealth Rock, which severely limits Incineroar's lifespan. Aerodactyl cannot switch in as safely but threatens to easily OHKO Incineroar with a Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Passimian and Hariyama take little damage from Incineroar's Dark-type attacks while having the speed and bulk, respectively, to KO it in return. Hariyama in particular fears little except a Tectonic Rage thanks to Thick Fat letting it resist Flare Blitz and threatens it back with Close Combat or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Thanks to Incineroar's low Speed, Pokemon such as Passimian, Sceptile, and Heliolisk can generally revenge kill it if it is missing much HP. Flame Charge variants can bypass this issue, however.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Incineroar takes very heavy damage from Stealth Rock, which is only compounded further if Spikes are set up, and this damage limits its switch-in and setup opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Vaporeon can threaten Incineroar with a STAB Scald, while Incineroar is forced to use its Z-Move to KO them, with the pivot set not being able to KO them. Slowking is weak to Incineroar's Dark-type attacks, but with a Colbur Berry, it generally has the bulk to threaten it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Incineroar to increase its impressive Attack to even higher levels, making it incredibly hard to wall. Knock Off is Incineroar's most reliable Dark-type attack and can remove items. If using Incinium Z, then Darkest Lariat must be used so that Incineroar has access to Malicious Moonsault. Earthquake hits Rhydon for super effective damage and hits Guzzlord for respectable damage, allowing Incineroar to eliminate them after a Swords Dance boost if they are slightly worn down. Flare Blitz is Incineroar's hardest-hitting move in general, 2HKOing Passimian unboosted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and maximum Speed EVs allow Incineroar to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding most of NU's defensive Pokemon, including Blastoise and Seismitoad. A Jolly nature allows Incineroar to outspeed positive Speed nature base 50 Pokemon, such as Jolly Scrafty and Pangoro. Intimidate allows Incineroar to reduce an enemy's Attack upon switching in, providing it with an opportunity to set up while taking less damage. Figy Berry lets Incineroar switch into entry hazards more times, lets it better check Pokemon such as Comfey, and has good synergy with Flare Blitz. Incinium Z turns Darkest Lariat into Malicious Moonsault, a 180 Base Power attack that can generally KO or heavily dent any Pokemon that doesn't resist it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even unboosted Incineroar hits very hard, so it is often helpful to throw out strong attacks early-game. Flare Blitz can 2HKO Passimian unboosted, so it is often useful to use it if you expect Passimian to switch in, as removing Passimian means Incineroar is significantly harder to revenge kill. If Incineroar needs to set up Swords Dance to break the opponent's team, its HP must be preserved, so avoid switching it into unnecessary attacks. As Incineroar cannot typically break past its checks, such as Rhydon, without significant prior damage or a Z-Move, time its Z-Move usage very carefully. Intimidate can be used as a last-ditch effort to weaken a foe that Incineroar's team can't otherwise take on, so letting Incineroar be KOed to get an Intimidate off can occasionally be justified.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Incineroar is often walled or revenge killed by Fighting-types, Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Slowking and Garbodor are incredibly helpful. Entry hazard removal makes it significantly easier to use Incineroar, so partners such as Blastoise and Rotom are appreciated. Pokemon that can take on Ground-types for Incineroar such as Vaporeon, Rotom, and Decidueye are also ideal partners. Pokemon such as Houndoom and Braviary that appreciate Incineroar's ability to weaken enemy Rock-types are often good partners. Given Incineroar's prominent weakness to Water, Pokemon that can handle Water-type moves such as Vaporeon and Sceptile can be great partners.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Incineroar's Fire-type STAB of choice due to it threatening Comfey better than any other option. Fire Blast can be used to take advantage of Passimian's and Steelix's lower special bulk, 2HKOing the latter outright and 2HKOing the former after Stealth Rock most of the time. However, without Flare Blitz, Comfey can use Incineroar as setup fodder. Knock Off lets Incineroar remove items from enemies and also deals respectable damage, being especially useful against Pokemon such as Rhydon. U-turn combined with Incineroar's low Speed stat allows it to pivot out of bad matchups and bring in teammates without them taking damage. Earthquake is Incineroar's strongest attack against opposing Incineroar and Rhydon, which would otherwise be difficult to damage. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp lets Incineroar support its team by crippling switch-ins such as Passimian and Rhydon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>244 HP EVs maximize Incineroar's HP and let it activate its Berry after switching into Stealth Rock three times. 100 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Incineroar avoid the 3HKO from Mega Glalie's Earthquake and help it switch into physical attackers like Sneasel and Decidueye. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense to help Incineroar switch into Pokemon like Rotom and Whimsicott. Intimidate minimizes the damage Incineroar takes when switching into physical attackers, increasing its survivability. Figy Berry restores 50% of Incineroar's HP when it is low and gives it a substantial increase in bulk. Thanks to Incineroar's weakness to passive damage, the Berry's effect often comes into play.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions primarily as a pivot and, as such, Incineroar should aim to come in on attacks it takes little damage from and either throw off a safe attack or U-turn out, bringing a teammate in. Will-O-Wisp should be used when expecting a physical attacker to switch in that threatens Incineroar out, such as Rhydon or Passimian. Knock Off is generally a fairly safe move to use and can be thrown out without much risk if the opponent doesn't have a clear play. Stealth Rock and other forms of passive damage can be taken advantage of to guarantee that Incineroar consumes its Figy Berry, but in general, Incineroar's teammates should keep the field clear of hazards. Using Intimidate to reduce a foe's Attack and then using U-turn to switch out to an appropriate teammate is often a good strategy to help wall an opposing Pokemon and reduce the damage Incineroar's team takes. Incineroar can often freely U-turn out against enemies it expects to switch out, such as Decidueye and Rotom, giving its team momentum. Intimidate can be used as a last-ditch effort to weaken a foe that Incineroar's team can't otherwise take on, so letting Incineroar be KOed to get an Intimidate off can occasionally be justified.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Fighting-types resist Incineroar's safest move in Knock Off, having a Pokemon that resists Fighting such as defensive Slowking or Garbodor is very helpful. U-turn and Volt Switch users can capitalize on Incineroar's usage of U-turn to continuously put the opponent into a disadvantageous position. Entry hazard removal makes it significantly easier to use Incineroar, allowing it to pivot with more freedom, so partners such as Blastoise and Rotom are great. Incineroar appreciates friendly Ground-resistant Pokemon or Pokemon that can otherwise take Ground-type attacks such as Blastoise, Rotom, and Whimsicott. Given Incineroar's prominent weakness to Water-type attacks, partners such as Vaporeon and Sceptile can be effective. Wallbreakers such as Mega Glalie and Medicham appreciate Incineroar's slow U-turn, allowing them to come in with significantly less risk.</p>"

      "Weakness Policy": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up makes it hard for even super effective attacks from the likes of Aerodactyl and Passimian to revenge kill Incineroar and boosts Power Trip's damage output significantly. Flame Charge prevents Incineroar from being outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon like Magmortar, Sceptile, and Accelgor after a few uses. Power Trip lets Incineroar capitalize on its many forms of setup, becoming incredibly strong once stat boosts are accrued and allowing it to break Pokemon like Rhydon, Blastoise, and even Pyukumuku. Substitute shields Incineroar from status from Pokemon like Druddigon, Pyukumuku, and Wish Delphox, as well as letting it safely set up against such Pokemon. Alternatively, Drain Punch is Incineroar's best form of damage against opposing Incineroar as well as other Dark-types like Pangoro, Scrafty, and Guzzlord and improves its longevity. Taunt prevents Pokemon with Roar like Steelix from phazing Incineroar and Toxic users like Vaporeon, Blastoise, and Golbat from crippling it, although Substitute's utility is generally superior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment makes Incineroar much harder to take down, especially with the support of Bulk Up, while maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets it outspeed common revenge killers like Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Sceptile at +2 as well as Heliolisk and Delphox at +1. Weakness Policy provides Incineroar with a huge boost in power to Power Trip once activated and synergizes well with Bulk Up and dual screens support. Intimidate makes it easier for Incineroar to set up against Pokemon like Sneasel and Dhelmise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It isn't advised to directly switch Incineroar into Knock Off users like Sneasel and Dhelmise; although Incineroar's bulk, typing, and ability let it take hits from them well, losing its Weakness Policy is not ideal. Therefore, it's better to bring it in via pivots and double switches. Depending on the circumstance, it may be better to boost with Bulk Up or Flame Charge first. For instance, if the opponent's form of revenge killing cannot threaten heavy damage to Incineroar, boosting with Bulk Up is more practical. Similarly, if the opponent possesses fast, strong attackers like Aerodactyl and Magmortar, ensuring Incineroar can outspeed and dispose of them is more imperative. Additionally, if you expect the opponent to activate Incineroar's Weakness Policy, using Flame Charge to get the power boost of two Bulk Ups along with an increase in Speed is preferred. Certain passive Pokemon like Blastoise and Xatu may be more inclined to badly poison Incineroar with Toxic before it has racked up too many boosts rather than get immediate chip damage with their attacks. Use Substitute to give Incineroar another turn of free setup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is specialized for dual screens teams. As such, it requires support from Xatu or Electrode to function properly. Each Pokemon can also bring Incineroar safely into battle with U-turn or Volt Switch and prevent entry hazards from going up with Magic Bounce or Taunt. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Druddigon, Accelgor, and Mega Glalie is also beneficial, as it helps Incineroar break through checks like Rhydon and opposing Incineroar more reliably. Druddigon can also provide speed control with Glare and prevent opposing hazards with Taunt, while Accelgor and Mega Glalie can create momentum with Final Gambit and Explosion. Other setup sweepers like Comfey, Vivillon, and Mismagius fit on dual screens teams as well. Comfey and Mismagius can keep entry hazards on the field with Taunt and, in Mismagius's case, its Ghost typing, while Mismagius appreciates Incineroar's ability to pressure opposing Ghost-types. Additionally, all three can pressure Fighting-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Comfey's great offensive typing in Fairy combined with Triage priority moves such as Draining Kiss and Giga Drain helps it revenge kill many offensive threats like Passimian, Sneasel, and Medicham. The combination of Calm Mind and good priority options also makes Comfey a threatening late-game sweeper. However, due to its lackluster physical bulk, Comfey often struggles to switch into even neutral physical moves. Its relatively weak moves also mean that Comfey has to rely on its ability to set up to break down opposing teams and that it generally struggles to break through the tier's common walls such as Incineroar and Steelix. It also has a hard time breaking the tier's Poison-types like Garbodor, Weezing, and Golbat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can be run on the Calm Mind set to break down walls with Toxic or recovery like Golbat and Mega Audino. Choice Specs sets can be run for more immediate power with U-turn or Trick in the fourth moveslot. U-turn, especially when paired with Probopass, can help remove annoying Steel-types much more easily for Comfey to run wild.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Golbat, Weezing, and Garbodor can safely switch into Comfey variants lacking a super effective Hidden Power and reliably KO it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Silvally-Steel, Steelix, Klinklang, and Ferroseed can comfortably switch into Comfey before it has set up, although they all fear Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Cryogonal, Torterra, and bulky Incineroar variants can switch into Comfey comfortably and either Toxic or damage it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire types like Toxic or Calm Mind Delphox and Taunt Magmortar come in safely and take advantage of Comfey.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draining Kiss gives Comfey a priority STAB move that lets it hit Fighting-types such as Passimian and Medicham for super effective damage. Giga Drain gives it an option to hit bulky Water-types like Slowking and Vaporeon and Stealth Rock setters like Rhydon and Piloswine. Calm Mind helps it boost its power and bulk to clean up more easily late-game or potentially break more efficiently mid-game. Hidden Power Ground hits Poison- and Fire-types like Garbodor, Incineroar, Magmortar, and Delphox super effectively while still hitting all relevant Steel-types other than Ferroseed for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire gives Comfey a way to damage Steel-types like Steelix, Ferroseed, and Silvally-Steel for super effective damage while giving Comfey a way to damage bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing as well as Dhelmise. Hidden Power Psychic lets Comfey pose a greater threat to Poison-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>20 Speed EVs allow Comfey to outspeed maximum Speed Jolly Incineroar, while maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature make it as powerful as possible. The leftover EVs are pumped into HP to help Comfey set up more easily and potentially use its good defensive typing in a pinch. Life Orb boosts Comfey's generally lackluster damage output to help its offensive prowess. Triage helps it revenge kill faster attackers with Draining Kiss or Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Comfey as a revenge killer for certain setup sweepers like Scrafty and Samurott and Choice Scarf users like Passimian. Weaken its answers early-game by using Hidden Power on turns where you predict a Steel-type to come in. Try to have a teammate badly poison Pokemon that can potentially trouble Comfey with Toxic. Comfey can occasionally come in on Choice-locked Pokemon like Sneasel and Passimian. However, Comfey should not be switched into attacks recklessly, as that can hinder it from setting up later in the game. Set up Calm Mind late-game to break through Comfey's weakened checks and counters; without doing so, removing walls like Cryogonal and Torterra becomes impossible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Spikes setter such as Ferroseed or Garbodor helps weaken the opposing team further for Comfey to have an easier time cleaning. Both also help defensively against Poison-types, while Ferroseed acts as a switch-in to Steel-types. Choice Scarf Passimian serves as a reliable check to Swords Dance Incineroar, which otherwise comfortably takes advantage of Comfey. It can also potentially gain momentum to get Comfey in safely on different Fighting-type switch-ins. Pokemon that pressure Steel-types, such as Sigilyph, Mega Glalie, and Sceptile, help weaken Comfey's answers for an easier late-game sweep. Comfey appreciates answers to common Poison-types like Garbodor and Weezing if lacking a super effective Hidden Power; Steelix deals with Garbodor well, while Palossand can deal with both. Pursuit trappers such as Aerodactyl and Sneasel are also great partners for Comfey, as they are able to remove Delphox, one of Comfey's best checks.</p>"

  "Passimian": {
    "overview": "<p>Passimian takes the role of a capable revenge killer in NU thanks to the combination of its formidable attacking power, good bulk, and relatively high Speed tier, enabling it to fit on a variety of teams. Possessing a great movepool consisting of good coverage options such as Knock Off, Gunk Shot, and Earthquake alongside a pivot move in U-turn lets Passimian break through certain checks depending on what moves it chooses to run. Its Fighting typing allows it to check the majority of Dark-, Ice-, and Steel-types in the tier such as Incineroar, Mega Glalie, and Steelix, making it a valuable choice on any team that needs a reliable revenge killer for the aforementioned threats. While it has a good Speed tier, it still can be outsped by quite a few offensive Pokemon, such as opposing Choice Scarf users like Togedemaru, Delphox, and Rotom as well as Vivillon after a setup boost. It can also be worn down rather quickly due to the lack of reliable recovery, which is further problematic because of its tendency to pivot in repeatedly against common threats such as Incineroar and Aerodactyl throughout the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Passimian can utilize certain Z-Crystals like Rockium Z to function as a lure to checks like Golbat and Flyinium Z Sigilyph while letting it bluff a Choice item set, although the utility Choice Scarf provides is hard to pass up. Additionally, such sets are very matchup based. Equipping a Choice Band turns Passimian into a devastating wallbreaker, being incredibly difficult to switch into, although it misses out on the revenge killing capabilities of the Choice Scarf set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Comfey and Whimsicott can switch into Passimian's STAB attacks and proceed to threaten it out with their own Fairy-type STAB moves. However, they must be wary of Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Palossand can switch into any move of Passimian's with ease and can then set Stealth Rock or recover health with Shore Up, while Decidueye and Dhelmise can take the opportunity to clear entry hazards with Defog and Rapid Spin. Although Mismagius can't safely switch into Passimian, it can scout what Passimian wants to lock itself into with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically sturdy threats such as Slowking, Xatu, and Vikavolt may all switch into Passimian and proceed to cripple it with their status moves or threaten to KO it with their respective STAB attacks. However, they can all be broken through by Passimian with prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Golbat, Weezing, and Garbodor resist Passimian's Fighting-type moves, meaning they can usually come in against it and status it or heavily dent it with their own attacks. However, Golbat does not appreciate its Eviolite being removed by Knock Off, while Garbodor can be heavily dented by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Delphox, Togedemaru, and Rotom may all revenge kill Passimian if it is worn down, but they all do not switch into Passimian safely.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Passimian's strongest STAB option, letting it deal massive damage to the majority of neutral targets in the tier. U-turn acts as a great momentum provider, allowing Passimian to pivot out against the threats that intend to check it, such as Slowking and Palossand, as well as provide useful pivoting utility for its team. Knock Off is a great coverage option that lets Passimian hit Ghost- and Psychic-types, which otherwise check Passimian due to them being immune or resistant to its STAB attack. It also provides the extra utility of removing items, such as Eviolite from threats like Golbat and Rhydon, letting Passimian provide useful support for its teammates and wallbreak more easily later on in the match. Gunk Shot is a great coverage move to deal massive damage against Fairy-types such as Whimsicott and Mega Audino, which otherwise annoy Passimian. Earthquake can be run to let Passimian safely revenge kill Calm Mind Delphox and is Passimian's best form of damage against Garbodor. Rock Slide can also be run to hit Golbat, Vikavolt, and Delphox super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>EVs are fully invested in Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature to enhance Passimian's wallbreaking capabilities. A Choice Scarf cements Passimian's role as a formidable revenge killer, enabling it to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame and threaten out other offensive Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks and great coverage. Defiant, although situational, lets Passimian switch into moves like Silvally-Steel's Parting Shot and Rotom's Defog, providing it with a +2 Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Passimian is generally utilized to provide momentum for its team when utilizing a Choice Scarf, as its ability to force switches enables it to pivot out against the majority of threats with ease thanks to U-turn. While it is generally preferred to pivot out versus the opposing threat, Passimian should also be mindful if the foe decides to stay in, in which case using one of its coverage moves may be more desirable. However, it must be mindful of mindlessly spamming its STAB move in Close Combat, as it can often leave it in a predicament where it is forced to switch out, as threats such as Rotom, Weezing, and Palossand can easily come in and gain momentum. Passimian should take advantage of its typing and good physical bulk to pivot into threats like Incineroar, Aerodactyl, and Absol. Knock Off is a great move that can be spammed the majority of the time when Passimian is not pivoting out via U-turn, as Knock Off can even cripple threats that resist it by removing useful items from Pokemon like Weezing, Whimsicott, and Vaporeon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers that appreciate Passimian's ability to provide momentum such as Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Aerodactyl can be useful, as they are able to come onto the battlefield more reliably as a result. Aerodactyl is especially useful in Pursuit trapping Ghost-types that can otherwise dissuade Passimian from spamming its STAB attack. Entry hazard setters like Steelix, Ferroseed, and Rhydon all aid Passimian in wearing down opposing walls through entry hazard chip damage, letting it revenge kill threats more reliably. Pokemon such as Garbodor, Rotom, and Incineroar can switch into the Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-types that threaten Passimian like Whimsicott, Braviary, and Sigilyph. Garbodor also provides entry hazard setting support, while Rotom can remove them. Partners that can take on Flying-types like Sneasel and Aerodactyl can help Passimian deal with threatening Pokemon such as Braviary, Golbat, and Vivillon. Dark-types such as Guzzlord and Incineroar can also help check Psychic-types that can threaten Passimian, while Passimian can break through opposing Dark-types in return. Grass-types like Sceptile, Whimsicott, and Dhelmise can all break through Passimian's most common checks, such as Palossand and defensive Slowking, letting it wallbreak more easily. Sceptile is especially useful in wearing down opposing physical walls for Passimian, while Passimian can take on Sceptile's checks such as Incineroar and Ferroseed in return. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Heliolisk, Vikavolt, and Xatu can form formidable VoltTurn cores alongside Passimian, applying great offensive pressure onto the opposing team as they proceed to pivot out against incoming switch-ins.</p>"

Its Ground / Ghost typing combined with its formidable physical bulk makes it a solid check to Fighting-types such as Medicham and Toxicroak, as well as granting immunities to Normal, Fighting, and Electric and the ability to serve as a spinblocker. Thanks to its STAB Shadow Ball and base 100 Special Attack, Palossand is also one of the few Stealth Rock users in the tier that are able to beat Xatu. Water Compaction also allows Palossand to switch into weaker Water-type moves, such as Samurott's Aqua Jet, and gain a +2 Defense boost. However, due to Palossand's rather poor Special Defense and weakness to many offensive types, it is vulnerable to many of NU's strongest special attackers, namely Alolan Exeggutor, Whimsicott, and Vikavolt. While it has a solid Special Attack stat, it is still very passive and struggles to OHKO even offensive foes. Additionally, Palossand struggles to put its Ghost typing to use for spinblocking, as the only spinner it can really take on is the unviable Hitmontop.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to rack up damage on bulkier foes such as Vaporeon and Braviary, diminishing their effectiveness throughout a battle greatly; however, Palossand struggles to free up a moveslot for it. Ghostium Z can be used to OHKO Pokemon such as defensive Slowking after some chip damage and deal more damage to possible switch-ins such as Whimsicott while also lessening damage from Knock Off. However, Z-Moves are typically more useful on offensive sweepers such as Klinklang and Incineroar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Whimsicott and Sceptile don't mind either of Palossand's attacks, and they can use their respective Grass-type attacks to KO Palossand. Sceptile also takes little damage from any of Palossand's attacks, and can heal off the damage using Giga Drain</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Mega Glalie, Cryogonal, and Sneasel give Palossand a lot of trouble, dealing super effective damage with their STAB moves. Meanwhile, Palossand can't quite OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon, Slowking, and Samurott have the bulk to take attacks from Palossand and deal super effective damage with Scald and Waterfall.</p> <p><strong>Strong Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Palossand's strong point is physical bulk; however, it lacks the special bulk to take hits from special attackers such as Vivillon, Sceptile, and Guzzlord.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Because Palossand is so passive, getting inflicted with Toxic poison puts it on a timer lessens its utility greatly.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Dodrio and Braviary are completely immune to all of Palossand's attacks, so they are able to use it either as setup bait or as a free opportunity to Defog. Pokemon such as Charizard and Vivillon also are immune to Earth Power and take very little damage from Shadow Ball, so they gain setup opportunities from Palossand as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers:</strong> Palossand is rather passive when it comes to damaging bulkier foes. Therefore, Pokemon such as Scrafty, Braviary, Aromatisse, and Malamar are all able to use it as setup bait. Even against some Pokemon such as Delphox and Klinklang, where Palossand has a type advantage, it can be used as setup bait; the former can use Calm Mind and proceed to OHKO with a +1 Grass Knot or Inferno Overdrive, while Klinklang can use Magnet Rise and KO Palossand with Gear Grind and Corkscrew Crash at +1.</p>",

      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is useful for any competitive team, and Palossand's ability to beat other Stealth Rock users, such as Steelix and Rhydon, grants it many opportunities to set it up. Earth Power allows Palossand to hit Pokemon such as Steelix, Garbodor, and Heliolisk for super effective damage. Shadow Ball is crucial for dealing with Xatu, one of the tier's most common forms of entry hazard control. It also allows Palossand to deal solid damage versus Pokemon such as Slowking, Rotom, and Mismagius. Shore Up is important for keeping Palossand healthy throughout the battle, allowing it to switch into Pokemon such as Medicham and Passimian on multiple occasions.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Palossand's main role is to take physical hits; therefore, 252 EVs are placed into HP and Defense along with a Bold nature. Colbur Berry allows Palossand to take Dark-type moves such as Hitmonlee's Knock Off, Houndoom's Dark Pulse, and Incineroar's Darkest Lariat more effectively. Water Compaction, though situational, is Palossand's best ability; however, Palossand struggles to actually gain from it, since most Water-types are too overwhelming for it to handle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Palossand into Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Steelix in order to get up Stealth Rock, typically earlier in the battle. However, if you predict Xatu or a Defogger such as Whimsicott to switch in, use Shadow Ball in order to get off damage, making it easier to keep Stealth Rock on the field later in the battle. Pokemon such as Garbodor, Rhydon, and Druddigon also struggle to deal very much damage to Palossand, so switching Palossand directly into them will likely result in a free turn to use Stealth Rock. Once Palossand has taken a decent amount of damage, use Shore Up in order to keep it healthy throughout the battle. Be wary of Toxic from Pokemon such as Steelix and defensive Slowking, as it will put Palossand on a timer and lessen its utility. Palossand's partial Ghost typing also discourages Pokemon such as Medicham and Passimian from spamming High Jump Kick and Close Combat, so this could be used to your advantage throughout a battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special walls such as Incineroar and Vaporeon complement Palossand nicely, taking on special attackers such as Rotom and Slowking that threaten Palossand. Grass-types such as Sceptile and Whimsicott take care of Palossand's weakness to opposing Grass- and Water-types. Ferroseed is also able to set Spikes, which Palossand can then spinblock. Fire-types such as Delphox and Houndoom resist opposing Grass- and Ice-type moves and can fire back with super effective STAB attacks. Pokemon that are weak to Fighting-type moves such as Klinklang, Heliolisk, Sneasel, and Guzzlord all appreciate Palossand's ability to check said Fighting-types. A cleric such as Vaporeon or Mega Audino can use Heal Bell in order to cure a Toxic or burn placed on Palossand; additionally, both of them synergize well with Palossand, taking on Pokemon it's weak to.</p>"

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>As the tier's only viable user of Unaware, Pyukumuku is a solid choice on stall teams thanks to its great pure Water typing, high physical bulk, and unique combination of utility options. Pyukumuku sports an effective niche in Block + Spite, which allows it to trap foes and beat them one-on-one with Toxic stalling or PP depletion. This trait is important for stall teams, as it allows Pyukumuku to eliminate or weaken specific threats such as Incineroar and Braviary early on. Access to an uncommon move in Soak also allows Pyukumuku to stand up to powerful threats like Passimian and Incineroar by taking away their STAB bonuses and can be used in conjunction with Toxic to whittle away at bulky Pokemon like Steelix and Garbodor that are usually immune to poison. However, Pyukumuku is incredibly passive due to its reliance on status moves, which makes it Taunt bait for the likes of Comfey and Golbat. Furthermore, the ubiquity of Xatu is very problematic for Pyukumuku, as Xatu can bounce back all of Pyukumuku's moves and potentially countertrap it with its own Block. Block Pyukumuku also competes with Block variants of Calm Mind Slowking, which is a deadly late-game sweeper on stall teams thanks to its ability to trap foes, set up, and fire off boosted Scalds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trading in Leftovers for Poisonium Z lets Pyukumuku use Toxic once while under the effect of Encore and on the turn Pyukumuku is afflicted by Taunt, letting it badly poison Taunt and Encore users like Comfey and Whimsicott. Z-Toxic also grants Pyukumuku +1 Defense when used, allowing it Pyukumuku to take on powerful physical attackers such as Life Orb Medicham. This forfeits the passive recovery provided by Leftovers, however. Counter lessens Pyukumuku's passive nature by enabling it to surprise and eliminate strong physical attackers like Medicham and Gallade after they attack Pyukumuku. Soak enables Pyukumuku to badly poison Steel- and Poison-types like Silvally-Steel and Garbodor with Toxic while also removing STAB bonuses from powerful Pokemon like Rhydon and Absol, allowing it to much more easily check them. However, Pyukumuku is severely strapped for moveslots and cannot easily fit it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: All of Pyukumuku's viable moves bar Counter are status moves, meaning that users of Taunt such as Comfey, Houndoom, and Golbat are able to completely shut Pyukumuku down. Additionally, Comfey and Houndoom can use this as valuable time to set up with Calm Mind or Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Due to Magic Bounce, Xatu is able to reflect anything Pyukumuku throws at it, granting it a full immunity to all of its moves other than Counter. Pivoting into Block allows Xatu to counter trap Pyukumuku and stall it out of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-types</strong>: Sceptile, Dhelmise, Rotom, and Heliolisk are all able to hit Pyukumuku hard with super effective STAB moves. The latter two can take advantage of Pyukumuku if it switches out by generating momentum with Volt Switch, with Heliolisk also being able to recover HP if it switches into Soak due to Dry Skin.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Though poison from Toxic can be remedied with proper team support, users of Toxic such as Mega Audino and Steelix can cripple Pyukumuku and limit the amount of time it can stay on the field, as it has no way to heal off status outside of Rest.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong threats such as Life Orb Medicham and Guts Hariyama heavily pressure Pyukumuku if it's slightly chipped or it lacks Soak to deny them access to STAB-boosted attacks. Furthermore, since Pyukumuku lacks proper Special Defense investment, specially offensive wallbreakers like Guzzlord, Sceptile, and Magmortar are able to easily 2HKO it.</p>",

Toxic is Pyukumuku's only way of damaging foes reliably, discourages bulky Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Guzzlord from switching in, and can be used to quickly wear down Pokemon in general. Block traps passive Pokemon like Steelix and Mega Audino in, facilitating Pyukumuku's ability to PP stall with Spite or wear down foes with Toxic. Spite is an effective tool for PP stalling especially when paired with Block to prevent foes from switching out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Pyukumuku to check physical sweepers such as Incineroar and Klinklang as well as possible. Leftovers gives Pyukumuku a form of passive recovery, keeping it healthy in conjunction with Recover. Unaware is crucial on Pyukumuku, as this allows it to completely ignore stat boosts from setup Pokemon like Braviary and Samurott.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Recover generously to safely scout for any potential Z-Move and to keep Pyukumuku as healthy as possible, as this will allow it to check attackers much more easily when need be. With this in mind, Pyukumuku can safely pivot into multiple physical attackers and setup sweepers that can't easily break through it, including Braviary, Klinklang, Incineroar, and Assault Vest Hariyama. Pyukumuku can then throw off a Toxic or otherwise force them out. Keeping entry hazards off the field also helps negate any possible residual damage taken when switching in. Keep Pyukumuku away from Taunt users like Comfey and Golbat, as they shut down all of its options. Be mindful of a potential Toxic from passive Pokemon like Steelix and Slowking, as it puts Pyukumuku on a timer and makes it difficult for Pyukumuku to stay in and wear down foes with Toxic itself. However, it's usually a safe idea to switch Pyukumuku into a possible paralysis or burn to make it immune to Toxic poison. Use Block when you feel like something that loses to Pyukumuku will stay in. For instance, leads like Rhydon and Piloswine may want to set up Stealth Rock, whereas weakened Pokemon such as Mega Audino could potentially stay in and use Wish. Pyukumuku can then stall them out with Toxic or slowly strip them of their move options with Spite. Alongside removing STAB bonuses from the target, use Soak to discourage Steel- and Poison-types such as Steelix and Garbodor from switching in. It can also be used to preserve PP on moves like Recover and Toxic if foes are already poisoned or Pyukumuku is relatively healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pyukumuku's powerful defensive assets and extreme passiveness relegate it strictly to dedicated stall teams. Clerics like Mega Audino and Miltank are able to cure Pyukumuku of harmful status conditions with Heal Bell and can use their high special bulk to check Pokemon like Alolan Exeggutor. In return, Pyukumuku can take on physical setup sweepers such as Klinklang and Braviary. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Steelix and Ferroseed wear down switch-ins, as Pyukumuku tends to force many switches. Garbodor and Weezing can set Toxic Spikes to poison switch-ins for Pyukumuku. On the other hand, Defoggers such as Golbat, Xatu, Articuno, and Silvally-Steel can remove entry hazards, reducing the pressure put on Pyukumuku due to its tendency to switch in and out frequently. Furthermore, Xatu can bounce back moves that are harmful to Pyukumuku like Taunt and Toxic, while Articuno pressures Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott and offers cleric support with Heal Bell. Sneasel is able to outspeed and Pursuit trap various threats to stall teams such as Xatu, Mismagius, and Haunter while also providing offensive pressure for an archetype that struggles with general passivity.</p>"

  "Silvally-Poison": {
    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Poison is a reliable, albeit niche, Defogger that provides pivot support, can automatically remove Toxic Spikes because it's a grounded Poison-type, and checks threatening Pokemon like Comfey, Whimsicott, Passimian, and Sceptile. It also benefits from a vast pool of coverage options, including Surf, Grass Pledge, and Flamethrower, which improves its matchup against opposing entry hazard setters. Unfortunately, Silvally-Poison faces competition from more reliable Poison-types in Garbodor, Weezing, and Golbat, which provide similar amounts of utility but have recovery options, giving them better longevity. Silvally-Poison is also very susceptible to coverage moves such as Passimian's Earthquake and Whimsicott's Psychic, making it a bit unreliable as a check to them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be run on teams weak to Ferroseed, although Silvally-Poison will then struggle much more with Rhydon and Seismitoad. Toxic is more consistent at inflicting bad poison than Poison Fang, although the lack of immediate damage makes Silvally-Poison a much less effective check to Comfey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Xatu can block Silvally-Poison's Parting Shot with Magic Bounce and hit it hard with Psychic, while other Psychic-types like Slowking, Sigilyph, and Delphox threaten immense damage with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Although Silvally-Poison can remove Garbodor's Spikes with Defog, it takes great damage from Stomping Tantrum and can't really damage bulky variants of Garbodor as they slowly weaken it. Similarly, Weezing takes very little damage from Silvally-Poison's attacks and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Golbat can cripple Silvally-Poison with Taunt and whittle it down with repeated Brave Birds.</p> <p><strong>Ground- and Rock-types</strong>: Depending on which coverage move Silvally-Poison opts for, it will have a rougher time against certain Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Seismitoad. Furthermore, due to Silvally-Poison's rather mediocre damage output, Steelix can easily switch into Surf and set Stealth Rock or hit Silvally-Poison with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Multi-Attack deals with Fairy- and Grass-types like Comfey, Whimsicott, and Sceptile, although Poison Fang is a viable alternative STAB option that can cripple potential switch-ins like Xatu and Rotom. Surf gives Silvally-Poison coverage for entry hazard setters like Steelix, Rhydon, and Palossand as well as Aerodactyl, while Grass Pledge hits Seismitoad super effectively and provides similar coverage to Surf. U-turn helps bring teammates in safely and can net good chip damage on Slowking, although Parting Shot is a viable alternative that helps bring teammates in more safely thanks to its stat drops. Defog lets Silvally-Poison support its team by removing entry hazards, and its good coverage options let it perform the role of a Defogger adequately.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>60 Speed EVs let Silvally-Poison outspeed Incineroar, while the remaining EVs with a Careful nature let it better check Pokemon like Comfey and Sceptile. Silvally-Poison can also run a physically defensive EV spread to handle Pangoro better and avoid the 2HKO from Passimian's Earthquake, although the matchups against Comfey and Whimsicott become less favored. Poison Memory and RKS System are required for Silvally to turn into Silvally-Poison.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Poison is likely to draw in Pokemon like Steelix, Aerodactyl, and Seismitoad that are immune to or resist Poison; take this opportunity to get good chip damage on them with Surf or Grass Pledge. One can also opt to instead use U-turn on predicted switches to bring in a teammate capable of beating the opponent's switch-in. Because Silvally-Poison lacks a recovery move or the ability to hold an item like Leftovers or a pinch Berry, it's important to pick and choose when to switch it into attacks to keep it as healthy as possible so it can check the threats that it's supposed to. Additionally, although Silvally-Poison's bulk and defensive typing let it check Pokemon like Passimian, Comfey, and Whimsicott, one must be cautious of coverage moves like Passimian's Earthquake, Comfey's Hidden Power Ground, and Whimsicott's Psychic, which can inflict great damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Poison generally works as a form of role compression on balanced teams that are weak to Toxic Spikes and specific wallbreakers. Due to Silvally-Poison's lack of recovery, it appreciates Wish support from Vaporeon. In return, Silvally-Poison checks Grass-types like Whimsicott and Sceptile. Wallbreakers like Sigilyph, Pangoro, and Passimian appreciate Silvally-Poison's U-turn bringing them onto the field safely. Additionally, Sigilyph enjoys Silvally-Poison luring in Steelix and Rhydon and heavily damaging them with Surf, Passimian forms a VoltTurn core with it, and both Passimian and Pangoro benefit from it checking Fairy-types. Because of Silvally-Poison's reliability as a Defogger, Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock like Incineroar, Tinted Lens Sigilyph, and Charizard appreciate its support. In return, these Pokemon provide a secondary check to Grass-types.</p>"

  "Silvally-Steel": {
    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Steel serves as a great pick on balanced teams thanks to its Steel typing and access to pivoting moves, such as U-turn and Parting Shot, as well as entry hazard removal in Defog. Silvally-Steel's typing lets it check wallbreakers such as Sneasel, Guzzlord, and Whimsicott, which all give less defensively oriented builds trouble. Additionally, Silvally-Steel's typing allows it to use Defog easily against Poison-, Fairy-, and Grass-type Pokemon like Garbodor, Comfey, and Decidueye. Parting Shot and U-turn let Silvally-Steel function as a pivot and allow it to safely bring in threatening wallbreakers like Incineroar, Sneasel, and Medicham or other defensive Pokemon like Slowking, Xatu, and Vaporeon. Unfortunately, Silvally-Steel's ability mandates that it holds a Steel Memory to turn into Silvally-Steel, meaning it cannot hold a more useful item to increase its longevity like Leftovers or a pinch Berry. Furthermore, Silvally-Steel does not have access to a reliable recovery move, making it easy to wear down. Silvally-Steel is also weak to common types in Fire, Ground, and Fighting, giving it a poor matchup against metagame staples like Incineroar, Rhydon, Passimian, and Pangoro. Silvally-Steel's passiveness is problematic as well, as it lets many threatening wallbreakers such as Incineroar, Medicham, and Braviary switch in easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Silvally-Steel has many interesting coverage options at its disposal, such as Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, but it has trouble justifying their use over its utility moves. Thunder Wave lets Silvally-Steel paralyze faster Pokemon like Mega Glalie and Whimsicott, but Silvally-Steel relies heavily on Toxic to cripple Slowking and Incineroar and thus struggles to fit Thunder Wave in its moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix, Rhydon, and Piloswine all OHKO or 2HKO Silvally-Steel with Earthquake, although Steelix doesn't appreciate taking a Flamethrower, while Rhydon and Piloswine do not like being badly poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Passimian, Pangoro, Medicham, and Scrafty take little damage from Flamethrower and threaten to OHKO Silvally-Steel with super effective STAB Fighting-type moves. Additionally, Passimian's Defiant lets it switch into Defog and Parting Shot to gain an Attack boost, making it much harder to check defensively.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar all switch in easily on Flamethrower and OHKO Silvally-Steel with their Fire-type moves, but none of them want to be badly poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Braviary</strong>: Braviary comes in for free on Defog and Parting Shot and gets an Attack boost from Defiant. Additionally, Braviary can set up easily on Silvally-Steel with Substitute, as Flamethrower will not break its Substitute.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog lets Silvally-Steel clear entry hazards from the field. Flamethrower gives Silvally-Steel the means to threaten opposing Steel-types, such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and other Silvally-Steel, which would otherwise wall it. Toxic allows Silvally-Steel to badly poison bulky Water-, Fairy-, and Fire-types like Slowking, Comfey, and Incineroar. Multi-Attack can be used instead of Toxic so Silvally-Steel poses an immediate offensive threat to Fairy-types Comfey. U-turn lets Silvally-Steel pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Alternatively, Parting Shot also lowers the foe's Attack and Special Attack at the cost of being blocked by Xatu and giving Braviary and Passimian an Attack boost thanks to their ability, Defiant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>60 Speed EVs allow Silvally-Steel to outspeed maximum Speed Incineroar, while 252 HP EVs and 196 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature boost its special bulk. RKS System is Silvally-Steel's only ability and lets Silvally become Silvally-Steel with the help of a Steel Memory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Steel should be switched into Pokemon that it can reliably check, such as Comfey, Whimsicott, and Vivillon. However, be cautious of haphazardly switching Silvally-Steel in, as its lack of recovery means it will get worn down easily. Silvally-Steel must also be wary of switching into coverage moves like Earthquake from Mega Glalie, Hidden Power Ground from Comfey, and Focus Blast from Sceptile. Look to remove entry hazards off the field with Defog as quickly as possible, as they will further wear down Silvally-Steel. However, be cautious when using Defog and Parting Shot if the opponent has a Braviary or Passimian because both moves will give it an Attack boost thanks to its ability, Defiant. Use Toxic on common switch-ins to Silvally-Steel such as Slowking and Incineroar as they switch in, as Silvally-Steel can easily pivot out afterwards with U-turn or Parting Shot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Silvally-Steel's lack of reliable recovery, Wish users like Delphox and Vaporeon are excellent partners. Furthermore, Vaporeon appreciates Silvally-Steel's ability to pivot into Grass-types like Whimsicott and Dhelmise, while Silvally-Steel enjoys Vaporeon checking Fire- and Ground-types such as Delphox, Steelix, and Piloswine. Wallbreakers like Incineroar, Whimsicott, and Sneasel fit well alongside Silvally-Steel, as Silvally-Steel can use U-turn or Parting Shot to bring them in. Fighting-type Pokemon like Passimian, Pangoro, and Scrafty appreciate Silvally-Steel checking Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type Pokemon like Whimsicott, Comfey, Sigilyph, and Vivillon. Passimian in particular is a great partner, as it can form a pivoting core with Silvally-Steel. Stealth Rock setters like Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Palossand work well alongside Silvally-Steel. Seismitoad and Rhydon check threatening Fire-types like Incineroar and Magmortar, while Palossand beats Fighting-types like Passimian and Medicham. In return, Silvally-Steel deals with problematic Grass-types like Decidueye and Whimsicott for them. Because of Silvally-Steel's weakness to common Ground-types like Rhydon and Palossand, Pokemon such as Rotom, Whimsicott, and Torterra work well alongside Silvally-Steel, being able to take Ground-type attacks aimed its way with ease. Torterra in particular has good defensive synergy with Silvally-Steel and appreciates its ability to take Ice- and Flying-type moves.</p>"

Togedemaru makes for a great utility Pokemon as a result of this as well as Nuzzle, letting it support slow wallbreakers like Swords Dance Incineroar and Pangoro very effectively. Unfortunately, Togedemaru is walled by common Pokemon such as Steelix and Seismitoad, which often leaves it capable of doing nothing more than spamming U-turn. Furthermore, Togedemaru's poor bulk makes it difficult at times for even bulkier sets to switch into resisted hits from the likes of Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Vikavolt.</p>",

Super Fang can be run on the Choice Scarf set to give Togedemaru a way to meaningfully damage Steelix and Seismitoad. Toxic on the specially defensive set can be used to deal with more durable physical walls such as Palossand, Seismitoad, and Torterra, all of which can only be damaged by Super Fang.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix, Seismitoad, Palossand, Torterra, and Rhydon care little for Togedemaru's attacks and are able to put up entry hazards, set up with Curse or Swords Dance, or OHKO Togedemaru with Earthquake or Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Incineroar and Magmortar can OHKO Togedemaru with a super effective STAB move, while Incineroar can also utilize Togedemaru's lack of damage output to set up with Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting types like Passimian, Medicham, Scrafty, and Hariyama can threaten Togedemaru with super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Weezing, Garbodor, and Druddigon, despite not resisting Togedemaru's moves, can all take on any hit from it thanks to its lack of raw damage output.

Zing Zap and Iron Head are decent STAB moves that hit Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Comfey for super effective damage while also having the potential to cause flinch to the foe. Nuzzle is a decent option for this set to provide speed control and opens up the door for Togedemaru to paraflinch foes such as Incineroar until they faint, while Toxic cripples defensive switch-ins such as Seismitoad and Palossand. Wild Charge can be ran to always OHKO Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature makes Togedemaru a fast pivot that can outspeed other pivots such as Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Passimian as well as other fast threats like Sceptile, Aerodactyl, Vivillon, and +1 Timid Magmortar. Lightning Rod grants Togedemaru an immunity to Electric-type moves, allowing it to come in against Pokemon like Heliolisk and Vikavolt that attempt to use Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Togedemaru should use the boosted speed from Choice Scarf to pivot with U-turn or pick off a weakened foe such as Sceptile or Aerodactyl. Iron Head and Zing Zap are also good moves to use, since they help provide important chip damage to bulky Pokemon like Druddigon and Incineroar, and they have a small chance to cause flinch to the foe. Because it is relatively frail, Togedemaru should never be brought in against a direct attack; the more damage Togedemaru takes, the less time it has to pivot. However, it can easily come in against a Pokemon with Electric-type moves such as Heliolisk or Rotom or against users of Toxic such as Golbat thanks to its Steel typing. Another important thing to note is that Togedemaru can easily come in against Comfey's Draining Kiss but needs to watch out for Hidden Power Fire, especially after it has boosted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Togedemaru fits on teams that need a fast pivot as well as a check to Pokemon like Comfey, Heliolisk, Sneasel, and Sceptile. Druddigon with Glare is a notable partner, since it and Togedemaru can form a paralysis spreading core. Partners like Pangoro, Sceptile, and Sigilyph appreciate Togedemaru's ability to soft check Pokemon like Comfey, Mega Glalie, and Sneasel. These Pokemon can also help Togedemaru keep Ground- and Fighting-types in check in return. These Pokemon are also relatively frail and appreciate being brought into battle safely via U-turn and can punish what Togedemaru commonly draws in like Incineroar, Rhydon, and Steelix. Teammates such as Rhydon, Seismitoad, and Blastoise keep Fire-types in check so Togedemaru has an easier time pivoting. Wallbreakers like Alolan Exeggutor, Dhelmise, and Samurott appreciate Togedemaru drawing in Pokemon like Passimian, Rhydon, and Incineroar and benefit greatly from U-turn safely bringing them in. Bulky teammates such as Slowking, Dhelmise, and pivot Incineroar appreciate Togedemaru's immunity to Toxic. Incineroar can also form a pivoting core with Togedemaru. Wish support from teammates like Vaporeon and Delphox can help keep Togedemaru healthy if it has taken prior damage. Fighting-type checks such as Delphox, Garbodor, and Comfey also make good partners for Togedemaru.</p>"

Dhelmise also has a great matchup against most Stealth Rock setters in the tier, letting it outright prevent Stealth Rock from being set in ideal scenarios. Additionally, thanks to Dhelmise's great Attack stat, it doesn't struggle with passivity issues like Blastoise does; this also lets it run a fearsome Choice Band set capable of dealing with even the sturdiest of physical walls in Steelix and Weezing. However, Dhelmise struggles against the most common and influental Pokemon in the tier in Incineroar and gives it free opportunities to switch in and set up with Swords Dance. Dhelmise also suffers from its terrible Speed tier, leaving it easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Delphox, Flyinium Z Aerodactyl, and Magmortar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dhelmise can drop Anchor Shot for a couple of options on the Rapid Spin set. Earthquake lets Dhelmise hit Fire-types such as Incineroar and Delphox for respectable damage although leaves it helpless versus Weezing and Golbat.

Sneasel, Houndoom, and Absol threaten to Pursuit trap Dhelmise. Guzzlord threatens to OHKO Dhelmise with Dark Pulse. Intimidate Scrafty can attempt to set up on either variant of Dhelmise, while Z-Celebrate Malamar can try to on Rapid Spin versions of Dhelmise.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Braviary fears Heavy Slam and Anchor Shot, but it can pivot in on Power Whip and OHKO Dhelmise with Brave Bird. Vivillon can take advantage of a Dhelmise Choice-locked into Power Whip or Earthquake by setting up with Quiver Dance. Golbat takes little from Power Whip and fears only Knock Off from Dhelmise while threatening it in return with Brave Bird or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Glalie, Decidueye, Rotom, Sigilyph, and Delphox can't switch into Dhelmise, but they threaten to revenge kill it with super effective attacks. Magmortar can't switch in well to Dhelmise's strong STAB attacks but forces it out with its Fire-type STAB moves.

Anchor Shot lets Dhelmise prevent switch-ins like defensive Hariyama, Ferroseed, and Golbat from making a double switch while also giving Dhelmise a way to hit Grass- and Ground-resistant Pokemon like Xatu, Decidueye, Braviary, and Vivillon for fantastic damage. Rapid Spin allows Dhelmise to clear entry hazards. Synthesis is Dhelmise's most consistent form of recovery and lets it reliably check Pokemon like Rhydon and Passimian. Alternatively, Earthquake lets Dhelmise beat Garbodor while also dissuading Pokemon like Incineroar and Delphox from switching in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature lets Dhelmise hit as hard as possible. 204 Speed EVs let Dhelmise outspeed Vaporeon. The remaining EVs go into HP to provide Dhelmise with more bulk. Steelium Z allows Dhelmise to OHKO Garbodor and Decidueye with Corkscrew Crash. A Colbur Berry lets Dhelmise better take Knock Off from the likes of Passimian, Pangoro, and Scrafty while also helping Dhelmise avoid being Pursuit trapped by Pokemon like Sneasel and Absol. Steelworker is Dhelmise's only ability and powers up Anchor Shot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dhelmise should be brought in on Stealth Rock setters that don't pose a significant threat to it such as Steelix, Rhydon, and Miltank. Look to use Rapid Spin against Pokemon Dhelmise forces out such as Passimian, Heliolisk, and Vaporeon. However, be wary of opposing Ghost-types switching in to prevent a successful Rapid Spin. Utilize Anchor Shot's trapping capabilities to freely switch in the appropriate check to the opponent's Pokemon. This Dhelmise variant can relatively easily switch into Fighting-types like Passimian, Hariyama, and Scrafty, as Colbur Berry reduces the damage taken from a potential Knock Off. Rest should be used when Dhelmise has taken heavy damage or sustained a status ailment like a burn or Toxic poison. If using Synthesis, use it to heal chip damage from resisted hits like Heliolisk's Volt Switch and Sceptile's Giga Drain, but be mindful of Synthesis's low PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dhelmise's Rapid Spin support is appreciated by builds that revolve around setting Spikes. Garbodor appreciates Dhelmise being able to clear entry hazards without clearing its Spikes as well as Dhelmise's ability to switch into common Stealth Rock setters like Steelix and Rhydon. Cleric support from the likes of Mega Audino and Vaporeon is greatly appreciated so that Dhelmise can be woken up by Heal Bell after using Rest. Additionally, Mega Audino and Vaporeon provide Wish support for Dhelmise, further augmenting Dhelmise's ability to check Pokemon like Rhydon, Passimian, and Sceptile. Because of Dhelmise's weaknesses to both Ice and Fire, Pokemon with Thick Fat like Hariyama and Miltank make excellent partners, with Miltank also appreciating Dhelmise's ability to absorb Fighting-type moves. Stealth Rock setters like Piloswine, Steelix, and Rhydon have good synergy with Dhelmise, as they can threaten Flying-types such as Braviary, and Rhydon can also deal with Fire-types like Delphox and Houndoom. Since Dhelmise has a weakness to Dark, Pokemon like Incineroar, Guzzlord, and Hariyama are excellent teammates. Additionally, Incineroar can punish Choice item Pursuit users like Sneasel and Houndoom by using Swords Dance if they lock themselves into Pursuit.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power Whip is Dhelmise's strongest Grass-type STAB move and lets it threaten common Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Slowking, Steelix, and Rhydon. Heavy Slam gives Dhelmise the means to heavily damage Pokemon that resist Power Whip such as Braviary, Xatu, and Decidueye. Alternatively, Anchor Shot can be run to 2HKO Guzzlord while also letting Dhelmise trap switch-ins at the cost of doing less damage overall. Earthquake rounds out Dhelmise's coverage by hitting Fire-types like Incineroar, Delphox, and Magmortar for super effective damage while also reliably 2HKOing Guzzlord after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Golbat and softens them up for Dhelmise's stronger STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature let Dhelmise hit as hard as possible. 204 Speed EVs let Dhelmise outspeed everything up to Vaporeon. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to provide Dhelmise with additional bulk. A Choice Band further augments Dhelmise's wallbreaking capabilities and lets Dhelmise 2HKO Steelix and Guzzlord. Steelworker is Dhelmise's only ability and provides Dhelmise with a 1.5x boost to Heavy Slam and Anchor Shot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dhelmise has an excellent matchup against stall builds because it finds multiple opportunities to switch in against passive Pokemon like Mega Audino, Miltank, and Pyukumuku, fearing only a potential Toxic. Against more offensive teams, look to pivot Dhelmise in on a resisted hit such as Sceptile's Leaf Storm and then retaliate with an attack. Because of Dhelmise's solid bulk, it can easily be pivoted in on Stealth Rock users like Torterra, Steelix, and Rhydon. Thanks to its Ghost typing, Dhelmise can switch into Close Combat from Pokemon like Passimian and Hariyama, but it must be wary about a potential Knock Off. Because of their sheer strength and utility, all of Dhelmise's moves are easy to spam early-game. Both Power Whip and Heavy Slam heavily dent common switch-ins like Steelix and Incineroar, while Knock Off cripples Ferroseed and Golbat by removing their Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dhelmise set fits best on bulky builds, which can cover its weaknesses to common attacking types. Stealth Rock setters such as Steelix and Rhydon are also good partners, checking Flying-types like Vivillon and Braviary for Dhelmise. Because of Dhelmise's weakness to common Ice-, Fire-, and Dark-types like Mega Glalie and Incineroar, Hariyama is an excellent partner that can check said Pokemon while also exerting pressure on physically defensive foes. Dark-types such as Incineroar work well alongside Dhelmise by beating problematic Ghost-type Pokemon like Decidueye and Rotom. Furthermore, Sneasel, Houndoom, and Absol can provide Pursuit support to trap and remove Ghost-types. Cleric support from the likes of Mega Audino and Vaporeon is greatly appreciated by Dhelmise because it makes switching in on Scald from bulky Water-types less punishing. In addition, Mega Audino and Vaporeon provide Wish support for Dhelmise, letting it more comfortably pivot into resisted hits from Pokemon like Passimian and Torterra. Dhelmise is affected by every kind of entry hazard, so Pokemon that can clear or prevent entry hazards such as Silvally-Steel, Blastoise, and Xatu are helpful partners. Because Dhelmise is a slow wallbreaker, it appreciates being safely pivoted in. Passimian and Silvally-Steel can bring Dhelmise in safely with U-turn and Parting Shot. Passimian in particular is an excellent pivot to pair with Dhelmise, as Passimian draws in bulky Water-types like Blastoise, Slowking, and Vaporeon for Dhelmise to give it more opportunities to wallbreak, while Dhelmise forces in Incineroar and Guzzlord, both of which Passimian can beat.</p>"

  "Guzzlord": {
    "overview": "<p>Guzzlord is a threatening wallbreaker in NU that is capable of easily exploiting common defensive cores revolving around Pokemon such as Slowking, Steelix, and Golbat due to good defensive presence courtesy of its typing and massive HP. As a result of its defensive capabilities, Guzzlord can also take on certain offensive Pokemon such as Incineroar, Houndoom, and Rotom, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in and heavily pressure opposing teams. Stellar offensive typing, high Special Attack, Beast Boost, and vast coverage options also give Guzzlord great offensive presence, allowing it to hit everything in the tier neutrally and powerfully. However, Guzzlord's horribly low Speed leaves it outpaced by almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier. While Guzzlord's typing does provide it with key resistances to Electric, Water, Fire, and Grass as well as an immunity to Psychic, it also leaves Guzzlord vulnerable to Fairy-, Fighting-, Ice-, and Bug-type Pokemon like Whimsicott, Passimian, Mega Glalie, and Vikavolt. Guzzlord's typing also leaves it susceptible to coverage options from Pokemon it could otherwise switch into with ease, such as U-turn on Incineroar, Low Sweep on Decidueye, Focus Blast on Heliolisk, and Dazzling Gleam on Delphox.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest could be used to give Guzzlord an even easier time taking on special attackers like Sigilyph and Heliolisk, but such a set is easy to wear down and isn't very powerful. A defensive RestTalk set is an option that allows Guzzlord to mitigate its lack of recovery and more consistently deal with threats like Incineroar, Slowking, and Decidueye. Sludge Wave hits harder than Sludge Bomb, but the higher chance to poison foes means that Sludge Bomb tends to be more useful for wearing Pokemon down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Aromatisse, Whimsicott, and Mega Audino resist both of Guzzlord's STAB types and threaten to either set up on it in the case of the former one or OHKO it with their respective STAB moves. Though they need to be wary of Guzzlord's coverage, it's worth noting that Choice Specs variants can struggle with breaking through certain Fairy-types depending on the coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Defensive and Assault Vest variants of Hariyama are capable of switching into even Draco Meteor from Guzzlord and retaliating with a super effective Close Combat. Other Fighting-types like Passimian, Scrafty, and Medicham also threaten Guzzlord, though they struggle to switch into it. Pokemon like Decidueye can also potentially carry Fighting-type coverage to heavily damage Guzzlord.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Guzzlord's low Speed leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by a number of common offensive Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Sneasel, and Braviary.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Type: Null is Guzzlord's hardest check available, capable of taking even Choice Specs-boosted hits before restoring any lost HP with Rest. Other specially bulky Pokemon like Cryogonal are capable of serving as an annoyance to Guzzlord.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is an absurdly powerful STAB move that is guaranteed to hit non-Dragon-resistant and -immune Pokemon relatively hard, though the move's reliability is hindered by the fact that it drops Guzzlord's Special Attack by two stages. Dark Pulse is Guzzlord's secondary STAB move and is more reliable and spammable than Draco Meteor due to its lack of drawbacks and immunities. Fire Blast nails bulky Steel-types like Steelix, Ferroseed, and Silvally-Steel, as well as Whimsicott, which resists both of Guzzlord's STAB types. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types like Aromatisse and Mega Audino hard while also giving Guzzlord a more reliable means of OHKOing Whimsicott.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack coupled with a Modest nature makes Guzzlord a very devastating wallbreaker. 180 Speed EVs allow Guzzlord to outspeed Vaporeon. The remainder of the EVs are placed into Guzzlord's Defense to enable it to more reliably check Incineroar. Choice Specs further increases Guzzlord's damage output at the cost of locking it into one move. Beast Boost increases its Special Attack every time it KOes a Pokemon, progressively turning it into a more and more dangerous wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Guzzlord should mainly switch into Pokemon that cannot immediately threaten it such as Palossand, Decidueye, and non-Assault Vest Slowking. Because Guzzlord is locked into one move and isn't very fast, it is reliant on prediction in order to wallbreak to the best of its ability. For example, if Guzzlord predicts a Fairy-type to switch in, it should use Sludge Bomb. Dark Pulse is the move that Guzzlord should be using most of the time, as the move's lack of drawbacks and Pokemon immune to it prevent it from being completely exploitable. Exercise caution regarding which move Guzzlord locks itself into, especially in the case of Draco Meteor, as the fact that it's slow and can't switch moves can turn it into setup fodder for dangerous Pokemon like Klinklang and Comfey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Guzzlord fits best on bulky offensive teams that are in need of a wallbreaker that can directly switch into and pressure common defensive staples, most notably defensive Slowking. Pairing Guzzlord with entry hazard setters such as Rhydon, Steelix, Garbodor, and Weezing is ideal, as Guzzlord forces a lot of switches, a number of its switch-ins lack reliable recovery, and Guzzlord is capable of pressuring hazard control and removers like Xatu, Blastoise, and Silvally-Steel. In return, the latter three can check Fairy-types, with Garbodor and Weezing also being Fighting checks. Guzzlord also appreciates having teammates that can remove or prevent entry hazards like Blastoise, Xatu, Rotom, Silvally-Steel, and Golbat, since Guzzlord is forced out by many Pokemon, lacks recovery, and cannot reliably switch into defensive Pokemon like Steelix if it takes too much residual damage. Teammates that can switch into the types that Guzzlord is threatened by are appreciated, with Fighting checks like Slowking and Golbat, Ice checks like Delphox and Alolan Sandslash, and Fairy checks like Steelix and Garbodor being notable examples. Pivots such as Passimian, Heliolisk, Rotom, and Silvally-Steel make for useful partners, since they guarantee that Guzzlord can safely switch in against opposing teams. Passimian appreciates having Fighting checks heavily damaged and can provide Knock Off support, while Rotom and Silvally-Steel can weaken opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp and Parting Shot, respectively. Pokemon such as Sceptile, Aromatisse, Klinklang, and Omastar have a much easier time sweeping weakened teams late-game as a result of Guzzlord breaking through them.</p>"

      "Dragonium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is a powerful STAB move that threatens to hit most non-Dragon-resistant and -immune Pokemon fairly hard, though the move drops Guzzlord's Special Attack by two stages, which prevents it from being spammable and can potentially turn Guzzlord into setup fodder for Pokemon like Klinklang. Knock Off cripples checks like Golbat and Assault Vest Slowking by removing their item, making them much easier to overwhelm. Alternatively, Dark Pulse is a more consistent form of damage that lacks the drawbacks of Draco Meteor, making it easy to spam. Fire Blast gives Guzzlord super effective coverage for Steel-types such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Silvally-Steel, as well as Whimsicott. Heavy Slam gives Guzzlord coverage for Fairy-types that don't mind taking a Fire Blast such as Comfey, Aromatisse, and Mega Audino. Heavy Slam also 2HKOes Cryogonal, meaning that Guzzlord doesn't have to waste its Z-Move attempting to KO it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack coupled with a Modest nature allows Guzzlord to hit as hard as possible. 180 Speed EVs guarantee that Guzzlord outpaces Vaporeon, with the remainder of the EVs being poured into Guzzlord's Defense to give it an easier time switching into Incineroar. Dragonium Z turns Draco Meteor into Devastating Drake, a reliable and very powerful nuke that doesn't lower Guzzlord's Special Attack or have a chance to miss like Draco Meteor does. Beast Boost is Guzzlord's only ability and increases its Special Attack every time it KOes a foe, turning it into an increasingly threatening wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Guzzlord should primarily be used to punch holes into opposing teams early- to mid-game. Switch Guzzlord in on relatively passive Pokemon that are incapable of offensively pressuring it, such as Palossand and non-Assault Vest Slowking. Be wary of Toxic, however. Dark Pulse is typically the main move Guzzlord should be using, as the move is powerful, lacks drawbacks, and doesn't have any Pokemon immune to it. Be careful about using Draco Meteor, especially against more offensive teams, since the move drops Guzzlord's Special Attack by two stages and turns it into setup fodder for Pokemon like Klinklang, Malamar, and Incineroar. Against more defensive teams, Guzzlord should preserve its Z-Move so it can break through bulkier Pokemon like Golbat and Miltank. Guzzlord's ability to bluff a Choice Specs set makes its Z-Move an even deadlier asset.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Guzzlord fits best on bulky offensive teams that are in need of a wallbreaker that can directly switch into and heavily pressure common defensive staples, most notably Slowking. Guzzlord appreciates being paired with entry hazard setters such as Palossand, Garbodor, and Steelix due to the chip damage provided by entry hazards giving it an easier time breaking through teams. This is especially useful because Dragonium Z Guzzlord lacks initial firepower. Palossand and Garbodor also check Fighting-types for Guzzlord, while specially defensive Steelix is capable of taking on other special attackers that threaten Garbodor like Whimsicott and Heliolisk. Due to how easy it is to offensively pressure Guzzlord, it appreciates teammates that can check some of the types it is threatened by, including Fighting-type checks like Slowking and Golbat, Fairy-type checks like Klinklang and Garbodor, and Ice-type checks like Hariyama and Silvally-Steel. Guzzlord appreciates being paired with Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Passimian, Heliolisk, Rotom, and Scyther, since it can experience difficulty directly switching into unresisted attacks. Late-game sweepers and cleaners like Comfey, Aromatisse, Klinklang, and Choice Scarf Passimian have an easier time finishing off weakened teams as a result of Guzzlord breaking through teams early- to mid-game.</p>"
