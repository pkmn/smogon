  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Gardevoir's Fairy typing makes it a valuable Pokemon on Psychic teams, as it can check most threatening Dark- and Dragon-types like Mega Sableye, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon. Gardevoirite allows it to Mega Evolve and serve as a tremendous wallbreaker. Mega Gardevoir's ability in Pixilate makes its STAB Hyper Voice devastate many threats such as Mega Sableye, Mandibuzz, and Dragonite. On the other hand, regular Gardevoir's Trace allows it to perform well against weather and Terrain sweepers such as with Swift Swim Kingdra and Sand Rush Excadrill by making it outpace and either KO them or force them out. It also has access to utility moves such as Encore and Taunt to help with status users and entry hazard setters such as Chansey and Heatran. However, Mega Gardevoir faces competition for the Mega Evolution slot on Psychic due to the type's many options in Alakazam, Latias, Gallade, and Slowbro. Gardevoir and its Mega forme also sit at an average Speed tier, making them susceptible to fast revenge killers, especially Choice Scarf users like Victini, Heracross, and Excadrill. Furthermore, Gardevoir's terrible physical bulk makes it weak to many common priority users and physical attackers such as Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Mega Sharpedo.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir is a great wallbreaker with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice and a high Special Attack stat, easily breaking walls like Clefable and Mega Slowbro. Its Psychic typing gives it good coverage and helps it check some Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, which is especially helpful for Fairy teams. It has a good movepool as well; Focus Blast gives it great coverage, and its utility options in Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Encore allow it to cripple physical attackers and deal with some defensive threats, respectively. Trace is a good pre-Mega ability to have, as Gardevoir can copy useful abilities to revenge kill weather sweepers, especially Sand Rush Excadrill. Mega Gardevoir also has a decent but crowded Speed tier that allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Landorus-T and Speed tie with Pokemon such as Manaphy. However, Gardevoir's low physical bulk makes it susceptible to being revenge killed by fast physical threats, and it may take lots of damage if it can't manage to KO the foe. This also makes it susceptible to priority users, especially Mega Scizor, which already has a positive matchup against Fairy. It's also easily walled by notable special walls like Chansey even with its great wallbreaking capabilities. Lastly, Gardevoir faces direct competition for the Mega slot from Mega Diancie, which has the ability to go mixed and break special walls, a higher Speed tier, and a Rock typing that helps it check Flying, Fire, and Poison teams; despite Mega Gardevoir's Psychic typing, Mega Diancie is actually a better check to Poison teams due to its neutrality to the type and ability to break past Alolan Muk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir can use Calm Mind to overwhelm walls like Zapdos and Mantine with its amazing power, but that prevents it from using Will-O-Wisp to cripple threats like Bisharp. Mega Gardevoir can run Hidden Power Fire to deal more damage to Scizor and Ferrothorn, but this would replace either Focus Blast, making Gardevoir walled by Heatran, or Taunt or Will-O-Wisp, making it susceptible to status users and common threats to Psychic such as Zapdos and Bisharp. Substitute is an option to prevent status from users like Porygon2, Zapdos, and Mantine while making Mega Gardevoir a reliable check to Bisharp. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can be used to fire off faster Moonblasts, but it's generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users like Victini and Jirachi.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Calm Mind can turn Mega Gardevoir into a terrifying wallbreaker but forces it to forgo a more useful move and is a bit difficult for Gardevoir to set up. Substitute can be used when scaring out threats like Dark- and Dragon-types fearing Hyper Voice. It also protects Gardevoir from Bisharp's Sucker Punch and other priority attacks. However, it's generally less useful than Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Encore, since they give Gardevoir the ability to cripple certain Pokemon that would otherwise pose threat to it. Thunderbolt can work wonderfully well with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain and can hit Skarmory and Mantine but still leaves Mega Gardevoir walled by most Celesteela sets and forces Gardevoir to give up a move that's usually more useful. Choice Scarf is an option to let Gardevoir act as a revenge killer to weather and Terrain sweepers like Kingdra and Alolan Raichu, but it is quite weak, and Mega Gardevoir's wallbreaking prowess is preferred most of the time.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Alolan Muk, and Jirachi normally take Gardevoir's attacks fairly well and can cripple it with status or KO in return.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Celesteela generally can take a hit from Gardevoir and OHKO it back with their Steel-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Kyurem-B, and Excadrill can easily revenge kill both Gardevoir and Mega Gardevoir. Priority users such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Dragonite also check Gardevoir and Mega Gardevoir by forcing them to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis from Thunder Wave users like Chansey and Klefki can cripple Gardevoir by lowering its capabilities as a revenge killer and wallbreaker by halving its Speed.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor are able to easily take any one hit Mega Gardevoir can throw at them. Celesteela especially fears nothing and can easily OHKO Gardevoir with Heavy Slam. Mega Scizor can also threaten Gardevoir with Bullet Punch, though it risks being burned on the switch. Other Steel-types like Choice Scarf or Sand Rush Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and defensive Heatran can also either outspeed Mega Gardevoir and KO it or take an attack and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dedicated special walls like Chansey, Mantine, and Alolan Muk can easily take most of Gardevoir's attacks. However, Taunt or Encore can be used to cripple these walls and weaken them, and Will-O-Wisp heavily cripples Alolan Muk.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mega Gardevoir's Speed is only slightly above average, so faster Pokemon like Greninja, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Gengar are able to easily revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: While most Poison-types are weak to Psyshock, many, such as Nihilego, Gengar, and Scolipede, can outspeed Gardevoir and KO it thanks to their high Speed. Some bulkier Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Alolan Muk can also take Mega Gardevoir's attacks fairly well and dish out large damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Status: Paralysis severely cripples Mega Gardevoir by halving its Speed, making it extremely susceptible to offensive threats. Toxic poison quickly wears down Mega Gardevoir and renders it incapable of slowly weakening special walls.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is Mega Gardevoir's strongest possible STAB move thanks to Pixilate's boost, OHKOing most Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Kyurem-B, and Mega Gallade. Psyshock is the second STAB option, hitting Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, Crobat, and Toxapex as well as other Pokemon that resist Hyper Voice such as Fire-types. Psyshock also helps against specially defensive threats like Mantine. Focus Blast hits Steel-types that resist both of Gardevoir's STAB moves like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone and threatens Normal-types like Porygon2. Will-O-Wisp is a great utility move used to cripple physical attackers like Bisharp, Mimikyu, Alolan Muk, and Mega Scizor on the switch. Taunt can be used to prevent foes like Chansey, Klefki, and Jirachi from setting up entry hazards or inflicting status and keeps the likes of Mega Charizard X and Gyarados from setting up. Encore can be used to surprise opponents and lock threats like Sucker Punch Bisharp, Light Screen + Reflect Klefki, and Substitute Suicune as well as Pokemon like Chansey and Heatran into status moves and hazards.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gardevoirite is needed to grant Gardevoir higher Special Attack and Speed as well as Pixilate to boost Hyper Voice and give it Fairy-type STAB. A Timid nature and maximum Speed EVs allow Mega Gardevoir to outpace Pokemon like Life Orb Kyurem-B and Nidoking. Maximum Special Attack EVs allow Gardevoir to act as a wallbreaker, denting anything that doesn't resist its attacks. Trace is used prior to Mega Evolving, as it can copy abilities like Flash Fire from Heatran, Water Absorb from Mantine, and Speed-boosting abilities such as Swift Swim and Sand Rush.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir should be used early on in the game to cripple any opposing walls to assist its teammates; however, it also is a powerful late-game sweeper if faster threats have been disposed of and defensive checks have been crippled or KOed. It can almost always fire off a Pixilate Hyper Voice once in play, allowing it to dent many threats that don't resist it. Thanks to Hyper Voice's few drawbacks, Mega Gardevoir can act as an incredible revenge killer. Mega Gardevoir can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physically offensive threats such as Alolan Muk and Bisharp as they switch in. Encore should be used to lock Pokemon like Chansey and Heatran into Stealth Rock or Toxic, and it can also be used to threaten things like Sucker Punch Bisharp. Taunt prevents foes like Zapdos and Mantine from firing off status moves and Heatran and Chansey from setting up entry hazards. Even though Mega Gardevoir's Pixilate lets it perform better as a wallbreaker, Trace can be used prior to Mega Evolving to counter weather-dependent threats like Mega Swampert, Excadrill, and Kingdra. The main drawback to not Mega Evolving immediately is that without Pixilate, Hyper Voice is practically worthless, so be sure to know when it is necessary to Mega Evolve and when to utilize Trace. Mega Gardevoir should be cautious when switching into Pokemon that carry status moves that cripple it like Zapdos, Toxapex, and Porygon2, as well as into physical attackers like Choice Scarf Excadrill, Terrakion, and Scolipede; that being said, it can be switched into weak special attacks, but it must be careful, as it doesn't run any reliable recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Victini is a necessity, as it can outpace other Choice Scarf threats that Mega Gardevoir struggles against such as Excadrill, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Bulu. Victini is also appreciated because it checks common threats to Psychic like Volcarona and Mega Scizor thanks to STAB V-create, and it also has the ability to cripple specially defensive walls that Mega Gardevoir doesn't appreciate such as Jirachi, Chansey, and Alolan Muk. Stealth Rock users such as Deoxys-S, Mew, and Jirachi help Mega Gardevoir's role in wallbreaking by providing chip damage every time an opposing Pokemon enters the field. Deoxys-S can also set up dual screens, Jirachi provides an immunity to Poison-type attacks, and Mew's Genesis Supernova can set up Psychic Terrain to boost the damage output of Gardevoir's Psychic-type attacks. Meloetta is a great partner, as it is immune to Ghost-type attacks from threats like Gengar, Alolan Marowak, and Mimikyu. An entry hazard remover like Latios, Mew, or Starmie helps prevent Mega Gardevoir from taking unnecessary damage upon entry. Slowbro's amazing physical bulk helps it check common threats to Mega Gardevoir such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, and Landorus-T, and its Thunder Wave cripples opposing Pokemon and allows Mega Gardevoir to successfully outspeed and KO them. Alakazam can be used to take out boosted physical attackers like Mega Charizard X and Mega Sharpedo with Counter.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is Mega Gardevoir's main STAB move and is capable of shattering many walls thanks to its Pixilate-boosted power. It's also capable of bypassing Substitutes from Pokemon like Suicune. Psyshock allows Mega Gardevoir to hit some special walls decently hard and lets it check some Poison-types, especially Mega Venusaur. Focus Blast is a valuable coverage move that allows Mega Gardevoir to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers like Mega Scizor and Excadrill and slightly chip at foes. It notably cripples Alolan Muk, which is a huge threat to Mega Gardevoir and Fairy in general. Alternatively, Taunt allows Mega Gardevoir to shut down some walls and work as a decent stallbreaker. Encore is also an option, as it gives Gardevoir more stallbreaking potential, but it is generally less useful overall.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Mega Gardevoir to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature enables Mega Gardevoir to make use of its good Speed tier and outspeed most walls along with key threats like Nidoking and Xurkitree. Trace allows Gardevoir to sometimes inherit useful abilities like Intimidate and Sand Rush before Mega Evolving and possibly revenge kill weather sweepers like Excadrill and Mega Swampert. However, be wary, as not Mega Evolving leaves Gardevoir without a Fairy-type STAB attack. Pixilate allows Mega Gardevoir to hit very hard with Hyper Voice. Gardevoirite is needed to enable Gardevoir to Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir should be used as an early-game wallbreaker, weakening the opposing team for teammates to clean up later. Hyper Voice should be used most of the time, for it has the most power and has decent coverage. Due to this, it is a very spammable move as well. On the other hand, use the appropriate move when the situation calls for it, like using Focus Blast to KO Heatran or Will-O-Wisp when a physical attacker switches in. Taunt or Encore can be used to allow Mega Gardevoir to wear down walls and make them easier to KO later on. In addition, they both give Mega Gardevoir some stallbreaking potential, enabling it to beat down some walls like Chansey. Gardevoir should also Mega Evolve as soon as possible in most situations to gain the stat boosts and Pixilate. Sometimes, though, if the opponent has a weather sweeper like Excadrill, it may be useful to postpone Mega Evolving to Trace useful abilities and revenge kill weather sweepers. However, this comes with the cost of leaving Hyper Voice a weak Normal-type attack. Gardevoir is not very bulky, especially physically, so bringing it in with double switches or U-turn or Volt Switch support is a good idea. Mega Gardevoir should also be played carefully against Poison teams, especially due to the inability to use Mega Diancie, because Gardevoir may be needed to break through Pokemon like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Avoid switching Mega Gardevoir into Pokemon that commonly carry status moves, as most status cripples it heavily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azumarill can benefit from Mega Gardevoir's early-game wallbreaking to clean up late-game with Z-Belly Drum. Tapu Koko is able to deal with Celesteela and Skarmory for Mega Gardevoir and can easily pivot out to Mega Gardevoir with Volt Switch or U-turn. Klefki is an especially great partner thanks to its ability to set up Spikes to aid Mega Gardevoir's wallbreaking, improve Gardevoir's survivability with dual screens, switch into certain Poison-type threats, paralyze threats with Thunder Wave, and check most physical setup sweepers like Mega Scizor with Foul Play. Clefable and Togekiss can hold Babiri Berry and utilize Fire-type coverage to check Steel-types, especially Mega Scizor. Clefable can also set up Stealth Rock, which slowly chips at foes. Tapu Bulu is a strong physical attacker that can break down many special walls that Mega Gardevoir can't touch, like Chansey and Mantine. Grassy Terrain support is also good, since it provides Gardevoir with recovery. Tapu Fini and Togekiss can provide Defog support, which reduces the amount of unnecessary chip damage Mega Gardevoir takes; this is important mostly against Poison teams.</p> "

  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Magnet Pull granting Magnezone the ability to trap annoying or threatening Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Choice-locked Excadrill makes it a decent choice for an Electric team. Magnezone's Steel typing gives it a resistance to multiple types along with an immunity to Poison-type moves. Coupled with its great bulk, Magnezone can act as a great check to Pokemon of the types it resists that do not carry super effective coverage. Furthermore, this lets Magnezone act as an excellent pivot with Volt Switch. It has excellent Special Attack, allowing it to act as a strong wallbreaker. However, its Steel typing increases its weakness to Ground-type moves while also making it weak to common Fighting- and Fire-type coverage. Magnezone has very low Speed, which can be easily exploited. It lacks strong coverage moves and has to rely on Hidden Power Fire for coverage against the Steel-types it traps. However, Magnezone is still an excellent pick for an Electric team due to its ability to beat threats that Electric teams otherwise struggle with, like Excadrill and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Magnezone provides essential support against Water-types by defeating Pokemon that Ferrothorn struggles against such as Keldeo, Mantine, and Toxapex. With Hidden Power Ice, it is able to check Landorus, Garchomp, and Gliscor, three of the most threatening Pokemon to Steel-type teams. Also, it can trap and defeat opposing Steel-types like Celesteela and Skarmory thanks to Magnet Pull. Furthermore, Hidden Power Fire can help it eliminate other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. However, Magnezone has an abysmal movepool that forces it to heavily rely on STAB moves and use Hidden Power as its main form of coverage. Likewise, its mediocre Speed tier causes it to be easily outsped and KOed by popular Choice Scarf users like Excadrill and faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Dugtrio. Despite its ability to check Landorus and Gliscor, Magnezone is generally useless against Ground-type teams because of its 4x weakness to Ground.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>A set utilising Choice Scarf can be used in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice to lure in threats like Landorus. However, it is not as viable due to the fact that Electric teams have better Choice Scarf users like Xurkitree and that even with a Choice Scarf, Magnezone's Speed is rather low. Air Balloon is another semi-viable item. It makes Magnezone a perfect counter to a Choice-locked Excadrill, as it has to lock itself into either Iron Head or Rock Slide, but this causes Magnezone to lose out on a lot of power.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Choice Specs can be used to do more damage, but this forces Magnezone to rely on its horrible Speed stat. Thus, it would not be able to defeat the faster threats that it is supposed to such as Keldeo. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative fourth coverage move to catch Pokemon like Swampert off guard, but this is too situational and does not provide nearly as many benefits as Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice do. Also, Ferrothorn and Celesteela can pressure those Pokemon better than Hidden Power Grass would.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types, especially those that resist Flash Cannon like Seismitoad and Excadrill, can easily take a hit from Magnezone and KO back with their Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Heracross and Breloom threaten Magnezone with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Entei can easily take care of Magnezone with their super effective Fire-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Specially defensive walls like Chansey and Gastrodon can heal damage taken from any attack that Magnezone goes for and can slowly whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon: Certain Electric-immune Pokemon that resist Flash Cannon like Alolan Marowak and Lanturn are excellent switch-ins to Magnezone, as it cannot deal much damage to either of them.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: These Pokemon kill Magnezone's momentum while being able to easily OHKO it with a STAB move.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt provides a strong STAB move with excellent coverage. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB move that allows Magnezone to hit Ground-types that tend to switch in like Hippowdon for solid damage while also nailing Fairy-, Ice-, and Rock-types for super effective damage. Volt Switch allows Magnezone to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and let Pokemon that are more suitable for dealing with the foe come in. Hidden Power Fire lets it hit the Steel-types it traps such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Excadrill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs along with a Modest nature grants Magnezone the wallbreaking power it needs, letting it damage the opposing team enough for sweepers like Alolan Raichu to clean up. Magnet Pull lets it trap and remove Steel-types. 176 Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed Azumarill. The rest of the EVs maximize its wallbreaking potential and overall bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magnezone's 4x weakness to Ground can be very troublesome at times. Even Pokemon like Latios can carry Ground-type coverage, so try to scout for such moves before letting Magnezone come in. Similarly, try not to switch it directly in against foes carrying Choice items like Excadrill and Tapu Bulu, as they can lock themselves into super effective moves. Scout for what move they choose to lock themselves into first. Sacrificing a Pokemon to a Steel-type to see what the Pokemon locks itself into is fine as well. For example, sacrificing Zapdos to an Excadrill that locks itself into Rock Slide before bringing Magnezone in is an optimal play. However, switching it in immediately against defensive threats like Ferrothorn to remove them is fine. Due to its decent bulk, switching it in to tank a hit or two from Pokemon that can't hit it for super effective damage is fine if its trapping utility is unneeded. Use pivoting moves like U-turn and Volt Switch to bring Magnezone in, as it hates being worn down. If Magnezone's ability to trap Steel-types is unneeded, it can be used early-game to wallbreak and make it easier for sweepers like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu to clean up. Be careful about what you choose to lock Magnezone into. Locking it into a move that is resisted by multiple Pokemon on the opposing team generally results in a huge loss of momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone provides excellent synergy because of the pivoting cores that it forms with Pokemon like Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko also benefits from the removal of Ferrothorn and Excadrill, which lets it freely spam its Electric-type STAB moves. It also provides Electric Terrain to further increase the power of Magnezone's Electric-type moves while getting rid of Fighting-types that beat Magnezone. Alolan Raichu appreciates Magnezone's wallbreaking power making it much easier for it to clean up, and it excels at removing threatening Fighting-types. Zapdos provides Magnezone with a great wall to fall back on against threatening Ground- and Fighting-types. Rotom-W appreciates the removal of Mold Breaker Excadrill and Ferrothorn, as both are great checks to it. Its resistance to Fire-type moves and immunity to Ground-type moves makes it a good partner for Magnezone. Alolan Golem provides Stealth Rock support, breaking a potential Sturdy or Focus Sash. It resists Fire-type moves, making it a great check to Pokemon like Victini, but stacks the weakness to Fighting-type moves and the 4x weakness to Ground-type moves. Xurkitree, similarly to most other Electric-types, loves the removal of its two excellent checks, Ferrothorn and Excadrill, making it much easier to spam Thunderbolt against Steel teams. However, it can be extremely hard to fit both Xurkitree and Magnezone in the same team given how important the support other Electric-types provide.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Magnezone to pivot out of disadvantageous matchups and generate momentum. Thunderbolt functions as a powerful STAB move that will KO threats such as non-Choice Scarf Keldeo. Flash Cannon is the secondary STAB attack that is used to neutrally hit Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Electric. Hidden Power Ice is used to take out massive threats that Magnezone lures in like Landorus and Gliscor. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire permits it to eliminate trapped Steel-type foes like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Magnezone to have offensive presence. Maximum Speed investment paired with a Timid nature and Choice Scarf helps maximize Magnezone's lackluster Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Landorus and Keldeo. Magnet Pull is the preferred ability because it will allow Magnezone to trap and eliminate troublesome opposing Steel-type Pokemon like Celesteela.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volt Switch should be utilized often to gain momentum against the opponent while causing important chip damage. However, avoid spamming it when the opponent has a Ground-type Pokemon like Swampert, as it can switch in and completely kill the momentum. In this situation, try hard switching to a Pokemon with a better matchup, such as Celesteela. Nonetheless, Magnezone makes a great lead because it can scout the opponent's lead and safely Volt Switch out. As Volt Switch encourages the opponent to make switches, stacking up entry hazards on the opponent's side for more residual damage is essential. However, Spikes and Sticky Web should be prevented on Magnezone's side because they will severely limit its ability to pivot or outspeed threats. As with most Choice Scarf users, Magnezone can be used as a great late-game sweeper once the opposing team has been worn down significantly. Magnezone should be switched into predicted Steel-type switch-ins like Celesteela and Ferrothorn. If you're running Hidden Power Ice, this move should not be revealed immediately so that Magnezone can lure in Pokemon like Landorus and Gliscor and beat them. It is important to be careful around teams with threatening setup sweepers, such as Mega Charizard X, Kommo-o, and Porygon-Z, which can safely set up against Magnezone and sweep the rest of the team. Thus, Magnezone should always pivot against teams with said sweepers so that they cannot come in and set up against it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Celesteela and Skarmory are essential teammates because they cover Magnezone's horrible 4x weakness to Ground-type moves. In addition to being immune to said attacks, they are both able to individually pressure Ground-type Pokemon like Excadrill and Landorus-T. Celesteela is able to wear them down with moves like Leech Seed and Toxic, while Skarmory can set up Spikes. Furthermore, Celesteela is able to run Flamethrower, which gives more liberty for Magnezone to run Hidden Power Ice, and its Leech Seed can provide passive recovery to Magnezone. Heatran is a necessary teammate to any Steel-type Pokemon because of its immunity to Fire-type attacks. It gives essential support in the Steel matchup, which permits Magnezone to run Hidden Power Ice. Moreover, it is a great trapper that can isolate and eliminate specially defensive threats to Magnezone such as Chansey as well as set up Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn is able to lay Spikes on the opponent's side and assists Magnezone in the Water matchup by taking out part Ground-types like Swampert, which allows Magnezone to rather easily sweep the rest of the team. Mega Scizor can create a VoltTurn core with Magnezone while also breaking special walls for it. Additionally, it profits from Magnezone taking out many of its threats like Celesteela and bulky Water-types like Toxapex. In addition, it can remove Magnezone's checks like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Lopunny with Bullet Punch. Excadrill is able to remove entry hazards for Magnezone while also being able to clean the opponent's team once Magnezone has eliminated all its threats such as Celesteela. Moreover, it can defeat Fire-types that Magnezone may struggle against such as Alolan Marowak. Bisharp can safely set up once Magnezone pivots it into the battle. Also, it can take advantage of all the residual damage caused by Volt Switch momentum and hazards to sweep late-game.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Mega Gallade is a staple on Fighting teams by virtue of its amazing Attack stat, great typing, and setup capabilities making it a great wallbreaker. Its Psychic typing helps Mega Gallade serve as a solid check to Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, which are otherwise big threats to Fighting. After using a Swords Dance, the list of Pokemon that can switch into Mega Gallade becomes very small, as even Skarmory has a chance to be OHKOed after Stealth Rock. Mega Gallade also sits at a very solid base 110 Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Garchomp, Keldeo, and Nihilego unless they're using a Choice Scarf. It has great coverage options, including Knock Off and Ice Punch, helping it hit threats like Slowbro and Landorus-T. Additionally, Mega Gallade is one of Fighting's only users of Knock Off, giving the team a great utility option by removing the foe's item. It can be useful against users of Choice Scarf and Leftovers. Knock Off is also a great option to use against Ghost-type Pokemon such as Jellicent and Alolan Marowak. Mega Gallade’s good special bulk allows it to survive hits from the likes of Latios and Gengar, allowing it to check these Pokemon if it hasn’t taken prior damage. However, while base 110 Speed is above average, Mega Gallade can be taken advantage of by faster revenge killers holding a Choice Scarf and is forced to Speed tie with important Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Mega Diancie. Mega Gallade has bad physical bulk as well, which means it cannot afford to switch into most powerful physical attackers such as Excadrill. Mega Gallade’s somewhat average overall bulk can limit the amount of times it can set up with Swords Dance. Lastly, it is susceptible to strong priority moves such as Scizor’s Bullet Punch and Dragonite’s Extreme Speed.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Mega Gallade's Fighting typing allows it to heavily pressure the Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that threaten its teammates. It has an exceptional Attack stat that is only amplified by its access to Swords Dance, which allows it to function as a dominant wallbreaker. In addition to this, Mega Gallade has a good Speed tier that permits it to function as an imposing sweeper. It has access to two strong and reliable STAB attacks that provide coverage only resisted by Psychic and completely walled by Sableye: Zen Headbutt and Close Combat. Furthermore, it is able to cripple the opposing team by removing important items, like Leftovers and Choice items, thanks to its access to Knock Off, which also hits the Psychic-types that resist its STAB moves. Also, Mega Gallade has access to priority through Shadow Sneak, so it can deal with some faster threats or Pokemon it Speed ties with after they have been weakened, notably Latios, Gengar, and Tapu Koko. While Mega Gallade's imposing offensive presence often causes the foe to switch out and allow it to set up, its lackluster physical bulk limits its ability to set up often and causes it to be pressured by powerful priority attacks like Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack, and Scizor's Bullet Punch. While its Speed tier is decent, it Speed ties with many dangerous Pokemon like Gengar, Latios, and Mega Diancie and is outsped and OHKOed by a variety of revenge killers such as Mega Pidgeot and Choice Specs Tapu Koko. Mega Gallade relies heavily on its offensive abilities, so being burned or paralyzed would cripple it, while being poisoned would limit its ability to sweep and wallbreak effectively.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance (Fighting)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance makes Mega Gallade a threat to almost any Pokemon hoping to switch in. Close Combat is Mega Gallade’s main STAB move, as it is extremely powerful. This comes at the cost of lowering defenses, however, leaving Mega Gallade open to being revenge killed. Zen Headbutt is Mega Gallade’s secondary STAB move and is primarily used to 2HKO Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, which wall Mega Gallade and most Fighting teams otherwise. It's also used as a good STAB move if Close Combat is resisted, namely against Bug-types such as Volcarona. Knock Off is a great coverage option that can hit Psychic- and Ghost-types for a lot of damage while also removing their items. This is especially useful for threats like Latios. Ice Punch is an alternative coverage option that can beat Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus while still managing to hit Latios very hard. Unlike Knock Off, it does not manage to OHKO Latios without prior chip damage, however. Finally, Shadow Sneak can be used as an option for priority that offers unresisted coverage in combination with Close Combat. It's usually very weak, however, and is merely used for getting chip damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Mega Gallade’s Attack and Speed, allowing it to hit as hard and fast as possible. Justified is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving, as it can allow Gallade to switch into attacks such as Knock Off and gain an Attack boost. A Jolly nature is necessary so that Mega Gallade can outspeed as many relevant offensive Pokemon as possible, giving it more opportunities to sweep. Inner Focus allows Mega Gallade to avoid flinching from attacks like Fake Out and Iron Head. Galladite is required for Mega Gallade to Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gallade is typically used early-game as a wallbreaker that can help a faster teammate such as Choice Scarf Terrakion clean late-game by beating the walls that trouble it. Similarly, if all faster revenge killers have been KOed, Mega Gallade can be used as a dangerous sweeper late-game. It is important to be selective when deciding to set up with Swords Dance instead of simply using an attack, as faster Pokemon can find various opportunities to revenge kill Mega Gallade. It should be brought out against defensive threats like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, since it can easily 2HKO both of them with Zen Headbutt. It is recommended for Stealth Rock to be on the field early-game, as Mega Gallade’s immediate attacking power forces many switches. In matchups where dangerous Choice Scarf users such as Latios and Greninja are present, Mega Gallade should be preserved, as it can survive a hit from these Pokemon and OHKO them in return. Status conditions, especially burn and paralysis, should be avoided, as they cripple Mega Gallade for the rest of the game. Additionally, Mega Gallade should not recklessly switch into special and especially physical attacks, as it is very easily worn down. Similarly, do not use Close Combat unless necessary, as the defense drops make it even more vulnerable to priority moves and revenge killing.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cobalion is an excellent team option that is able to function as a Stealth Rock setter while crippling faster threats with Thunder Wave, giving Mega Gallade a better chance to sweep. Terrakion is another great teammate that can shine against more offensive teams thanks to its ability to use a Choice Scarf and beat problematic Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. Keldeo is a very strong special wallbreaker that can break many Pokemon that Mega Gallade struggles with, such as Mega Sableye. Mega Gallade, in return, can beat Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, which wall Keldeo. Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o is great against more offensive teams, which Mega Gallade often struggles against. Heracross can be used in combination with Mega Gallade as a great sweeper against Psychic teams and can effectively Pursuit trap threats such as Victini after V-create. Buzzwole is another Choice Scarf user that can pivot into many physical attacks and serve as a very good Pokemon in the Psychic matchup. Breloom can beat bulky Water-types that can wall Mega Gallade such as Mega Slowbro and serve as a way to handle defensive threats such as Toxapex thanks to Spore. Choice Band Infernape can form a deadly wallbreaking core with Mega Gallade, as it can beat Mega Gallade's counters such as Mega Sableye.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Gallade's already impressive Attack stat, allowing it to break past Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Toxapex. Close Combat is another strong STAB move and can be used on Pokemon that resist or are immune to Zen Headbutt, such as threatening Dark-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar. Zen Headbutt is a powerful STAB move that allows Mega Gallade to greatly damage Pokemon that do not resist it and deal with Pokemon that resist Close Combat like Flying-types such as Zapdos. Knock Off provides a way to hit the Psychic-types that resist Mega Gallade's dual STAB combination while also taking out Ghost-types and removing items such as Choice Scarf from Landorus-T as it switches-in. Shadow Sneak is another way to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types and has the advantage of priority, thus hitting Choice Scarf users like Gengar, Blacephalon, and Latios before they can attack. It is also able to take out faster offensive threats such as Tapu Koko after they've been weakened. However, this move is significantly weaker than Knock Off. Alternatively, it can be used with Knock Off to provide anti-Psychic coverage, making Mega Gallade a valuable sweeper against opposing Psychic teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed allows Mega Gallade to efficiently function as a powerful physical sweeper and wallbreaker. Galladite allows Gallade to Mega Evolve, which greatly increases its Speed and Attack. Justified allows Gallade to get an Attack boost when switching in on Dark-type moves like Knock Off. Inner Focus guarantees that Mega Gallade cannot flinch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid being inflicted by status at all costs because that will completely cripple Mega Gallade. Mega Gallade should only set up in situations where it doesn't risk getting knocked out or afflicted with status. It does this well late-game if revenge killers are eliminated beforehand. Another situation where it should not set up is if there is a Ditto, which can reverse sweep the team with a boosted Knock Off. Use Mega Gallade to force foes to switch out; if the potential switch-ins are unable to handle a boosted Mega Gallade, use Swords Dance on the forced switch. Mega Gallade should not switch in on attacks often because that limits its ability to set up and sweep late-game. Likewise, Mega Gallade should stay healthy against teams with threats like Mega Sharpedo and Bisharp because it can survive a hit from them and OHKO in return. Knock Off should be used to hit predicted Ghost-type switch-ins or to remove items like Leftovers. Utilize Mega Gallade as a late-game cleaner that takes advantage of slower Pokemon or an early-game wallbreaker to eliminate threatening walls early on. Mega Gallade can be used to punch holes in the opposing team very early in the game, making its partners like Choice Scarf Victini and Latios more threatening. It should be used to quickly break walls that can be problematic in the long run like Rotom-W and Gastrodon. Close Combat should not be used in situations where Zen Headbutt can get the KO, because drops will increase Mega Gallade's vulnerability to priority moves. However, there is a risk of missing Zen Headbutt, so Close Combat would be preferable if that risk is not worth it. Avoid taking residual damage because this also amplifies Mega Gallade's weakness to priority. Shadow Sneak should be used to clean up the opposing team late-game once its revenge killers are weakened.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-S is able to stack entry hazards on the opposing side, which helps Mega Gallade sweep and wallbreak, while also preventing entry hazards on its side with Taunt, limiting the amount of residual damage Mega Gallade suffers. It is also able to set dual screens, which give Mega Gallade a better opportunity to set up. Jirachi helps Mega Gallade by dealing with the Fairy-types that it struggles against, bringing it in safely with U-turn, giving Mega Gallade two chances to sweep by using Healing Wish or healing Gallade with Wish, setting up Stealth Rock for Mega Gallade, and paralyzing faster threats with Thunder Wave. Victini helps break other physical walls, and they complement each other in the Steel-type matchup, with Mega Gallade taking out Heatran for it and Victini removing Pokemon like Celesteela. Choice Band Victini is also able to wallbreak, beating Pokemon that Mega Gallade struggles against like Mega Sableye. Latios and Latias are able to remove entry hazards for Mega Gallade, while it can take out the Dark-types they are vulnerable to like Tyranitar and Bisharp. Moreover, both are able to help it set up with Memento and Healing Wish, respectively. Mew is able to do many helpful things for Mega Gallade; the Mewnium Z set is able to form a powerful sweeping core with it, and Mew's stallbreaker set can help it take on threatening bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro. Focus Sash + Counter Alakazam is able to handle Mega Sharpedo and Bisharp for Mega Gallade if it has taken too much damage in the battle. Meloetta's immunity to Ghost-types attacks allows it to switch in on the Choice Scarf users of this type that threaten non-Shadow Sneak Mega Gallade. The two together for a potent wallbreaking core, with Mega Gallade dealing with special walls like Chansey and Meloetta dealing with physical walls like Skarmory.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Heatran is one of the most important Pokemon for Steel teams because of Flash Fire, which gives it a unique immunity to Fire, meaning every team is required to use it. It also has a unique role in using Magma Storm to trap and remove many walls that Steel may otherwise struggle to get past, such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Heatran's offensive and defensive base stats are mostly respectable, allowing it to have great power and bulk even without investment in those stats. As a result, it has great versatility, being able to use both offensive and defensive sets that can provide a wide range of different utility with its amazing movepool that includes Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Toxic. Unfortunately, Heatran's Fire typing is terrible defensively, exacerbating its weakness to Ground, bringing with it an annoying weakness to Water as well, and failing to even be useful because Flash Fire provides an immunity to Fire anyway. Its Speed is also quite poor, as it's forced to run a Timid nature for a usable Speed stat and still gets outsped by even neutral-natured base 90s like Meloetta. Uninvested Heatran is even outsped by Mega Venusaur, which it is supposed to check. Worst of all, Heatran lacks proper recovery, leaving it very vulnerable to being worn down and taken out over time.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Heatran compresses many useful roles for Fire teams due to its all-around good stats and unique typing. Exclusive access to Magma Storm combined with Taunt lets Heatran trap and break walls like Chansey found on balanced teams that otherwise can be major obstructions for its teammates. Heatran's Steel typing grants it a key neutrality to Rock-type moves, letting it check massive threats to Fire teams like Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Nihilego. Heatran's wide movepool can also let it fill other roles for a team, such as providing Stealth Rock or spreading status, though it faces competition from Torkoal in these areas. However, Heatran's 4x weakness to Ground forces it to use Air Balloon to check Earth Power Mega Diancie and leaves it forced out by defensive Ground-types like Swampert and Gliscor after its Air Balloon is popped, preventing it from effectively stallbreaking teams while these Pokemon are healthy enough to switch into it. Heatran also has a very mediocre Speed stat and is slower than some faster walls like Zapdos and Gliscor even with maximum Speed investment.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p>Substitute can be used on a trapper set to improve its stallbreaking ability. However, Heatran is already more than capable of breaking most walls anyway, and it cannot afford to lose its other moves in most cases. Protect is an option on more defensive Leftovers sets to scout and gain more recovery. The loss of an important utility move makes this a less appealing choice, though. Outside of its main roles, Heatran can take be a more traditional attacker with either Choice Specs or Choice Scarf to surprise opponents. However, these sets are often still underwhelming due to Heatran's mediocre Speed and can pose problems when in the Steel mirror matchup, as Heatran will be locked in to a move, leaving it as a free switch for the opposing Heatran almost all of the time.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Heatran can run a defensive set with a spread of 252 HP / 20 Def / 192 SpD / 44 Spe, a Calm nature, and Leftovers. This spread allows Heatran to capitalize on its defensive capabilities and switch into Rock types more easily, outspeed fast Mantine and Taunt it before it uses Defog, avoid a 2HKO from Choice Scarf Terrakion's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock, and survive Mega Diancie's Earth Power from full health most of the time. A Choice Scarf with a moveset of Fire Blast, Flash Cannon, Earth Power, and Hidden Power Ice lets Heatran surprise some of its usual checks like Garchomp with its boosted Speed tier and broad coverage, as well as immediately force Mega Diancie out after switching into a predicted Diamond Storm. However, this set faces competition from much more reliable Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Blacephalon, and Victini.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types are generally great checks to Heatran, as faster attackers can OHKO it and bulkier Pokemon can take multiple attacks. However, walls such as Swampert hate taking Toxic, and Toxapex runs the risk of being trapped and KOed by Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are usually naturally bulky enough to take one or two hits from Heatran and can OHKO it in return. Garchomp is an especially good check to Heatran, as Garchomp outspeeds it and resists Fire-type moves, which it can switch into. However, being poisoned by Toxic is crippling for most Ground-types, and Magma Storm can 2HKO even walls like Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Coverage: Due to Heatran's 4x weakness to Ground, it is vulnerable to almost any Ground-type coverage carried by attackers. Most importantly, if Heatran's Air Balloon has been popped, +1 Volcarona's Hidden Power Ground OHKOes offensive sets and can OHKO defensive sets too after minor chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Pokemon faster than Heatran, such as Terrakion and Mega Charizard Y, can easily revenge kill it with their super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Walls: While Heatran often carries stallbreaking tools, many walls are very capable against sets without Toxic or Taunt. In particular, Chansey and Porygon2 are great counters to Heatran that do not use both along with Magma Storm.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Opposing Air Balloon Heatran counters any Heatran set without Stone Edge, and if your own Heatran's Air Balloon is popped, it is very easily forced out.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Heatran's 4x weakness to Ground-type moves makes it unable to stand up to defensive and offensive Ground-types alike such as Gliscor, Swampert, Landorus, and Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Pokemon such as Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny can outspeed and blast through Heatran with their Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Water-types: Offensive Water-types such as Keldeo and Kingdra blow past Heatran, while it can't do much to threaten them back.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Heatran lacks reliable recovery and has to stay healthy to check Rock-types and stallbreak, so it is very vulnerable to being worn down by entry hazards and weak attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Faster Attackers</strong>: Heatran's underwhelming Speed makes it susceptible to being forced out or KOed by faster threats such as Mega Gallade, Kyurem-B, and Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Certain special walls that resist Magma Storm like Mantine and Tyranitar can switch into Heatran and outlast it under most conditions, but Heatran can cripple them with Toxic and then switch out to a teammate, while others like Chansey can be beaten due to Taunt if Heatran is healthy enough.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and remove walls such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur that often pose threats to Steel teams. Earth Power is used to hit opposing Heatran and Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex and Slowbro, enabling Heatran to defeat them after trapping them with Magma Storm. To make it even easier, Taunt prevents walls from healing or using other utility options like Thunder Wave and Roar, allowing Heatran to ensure the KOs. Because of Heatran's ability to force switches, it can reliably set Stealth Rock for the team. Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona if a teammate covers the need for Stealth Rock. Just as importantly, Stone Edge is also the only way Heatran can pop an opposing Heatran's Air Balloon. Toxic allows Heatran to cripple switch-ins and even beat Chansey and Porygon2, which are unlikely to otherwise be threatened by Heatran. Toxic can also cripple Volcarona but is much less reliable than Stone Edge for checking it after it sets up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Timid nature let Heatran function as a stallbreaker most effectively while still at least Speed tying with opposing Heatran. 4 Special Defense EVs are used to give Download Porygon-Z and Porygon2 a boost in Attack instead of a more useful Special Attack boost. If Heatran chooses to use Stone Edge, it should use a 28 Atk / 224 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe spread to guarantee the OHKO on Mega Charizard Y. Air Balloon makes Heatran a reliable check to Volcarona and opposing Heatran without Air Balloon. The temporary Ground immunity is also useful against Ground teams, allowing Heatran one turn to cripple Mega Garchomp safely. Leftovers recovery allows Heatran to beat walls more easily, but the utility of Air Balloon is often more important. If Heatran uses Leftovers, it should move 8 EVs into HP to avoid the OHKO from Mega Venusaur's Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Heatran should almost always fire off a Magma Storm whenever it comes in to trap whatever it hits and reduce the need for prediction. Its great Base Power means it can do significant chip damage to even Pokemon that resist Fire, so it's a relatively safe, though inaccurate, move. Against faster Pokemon that Heatran cannot stay in on, the trapping effect means you can freely bring in a check without fear of a double switch. If Heatran manages to trap a wall successfully, it should often use Taunt next to prevent recovery before returning to damaging attacks. While Taunt is predictable, recovery is too potent to risk not using Taunt in most cases. Against walls such as Clefable that aren't a threat to it at all, Heatran can set Stealth Rock after trapping them, but it can also use Stealth Rock whenever the enemy is forced to switch out. Take advantage of Heatran's great natural bulk, wide range of resistances, and multiple immunities to switch it in safely. The lack of recovery means Heatran should be careful not to take too much damage. If the opponent has certain threats such as their own Heatran or Volcarona, preserve Heatran's Air Balloon at all costs. It is crucial to making sure you can check these otherwise devastating attackers, as without Air Balloon, Volcarona cannot be stopped, and opposing Heatran can fire off super effective attacks without needing to predict. While Magma Storm 2HKOes Mega Sableye, it can spam Recover to PP stall Heatran, and Protect sets are even more difficult to take out. Be very aware of how much PP Magma Storm has left and how much you need to take Mega Sableye out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As the only Fire-immune Pokemon available to Steel teams, Heatran is needed on every viable team as a switch-in and check to Fire-types. Having either Skarmory or Celesteela is an absolute must for Heatran, as they check the many Ground- and Fighting-types that threaten it. Assault Vest Celesteela can take out many of Heatran's checks including Landorus, Mega Swampert, and opposing Heatran. Skarmory forms a powerful hazard stacking core with Heatran and appreciates having Taunt Heatran's help in keeping entry hazards on the field. On hyper offense teams, Skarmory will carry Stealth Rock, allowing Heatran to choose a more useful utility move. Mega Scizor and Magnezone are fantastic pivots that can bring Heatran into Fire-types that often switch into them. Choice Scarf Magnezone and Pursuit Bisharp are great tech options that can trap opposing Air Balloon Heatran and guarantee that they lose their item, allowing your Heatran to wreak havoc on the opponent's team.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Lava Plume has a 30% chance to burn the foe, which makes it a spammable attack and the best STAB move for Heatran when combined with its respectable damage output. Earth Power prevents Heatran from being walled by opposing Heatran and almost always OHKOes offensive Heatran. Stone Edge lets Heatran check Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona while also popping the Air Balloon of an opposing Heatran. Toxic can be used to cripple walls that switch into Heatran frequently like Slowbro and Porygon2, but it prevents Heatran from checking Mega Charizard Y. Heatran's great bulk and many immunities make it one of the best Stealth Rock setters, as it forces switches easily. However, Taunt may be used with Toxic to stallbreak if a teammate carries Stealth Rock instead.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and Calm nature allow Heatran to always OHKO Mega Charizard Y with Stone Edge, outspeed Mega Venusaur, and be as specially bulky as possible. Leftovers gives Heatran recovery and improves its longevity to allow it to freely switch into attacks throughout the battle.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While this set has great bulk and can pivot into most Fire-type attackers with ease, be careful of coverage, as Heatran is still too vulnerable to Ground-type attacks to take them lightly. In general, while Heatran should be pivoting into attacks often, be very careful not to let it get too damaged, as it lacks recovery and is often its team's only switch-in to Fire-type attacks. Stealth Rock can be relatively freely set when Heatran forces a switch or on other walls. If you choose to run Taunt, make sure to use it to prevent walls from paralyzing Heatran or setting their own hazards. As it has no Air Balloon of its own, Heatran should try to catch opposing Heatran switching in with Stone Edge, if applicable, to KO them with Earth Power after. Be aware of Lava Plume's burn chance, as you do not want to burn most walls such as Slowbro if Heatran carries Toxic. Heatran's low Speed means stallbreakers such as Zapdos and Mew are capable of stopping it with either Substitute or Taunt if they get in safely, so it is even more important than with faster sets to be on top of prediction and hit them with Toxic on the switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because of Flash Fire, Heatran is needed for every Steel team. Skarmory is the preferred Ground-immune teammate for this Heatran set, as its amazing physical bulk and recovery in Roost make it an optimal defensive partner for checking Fighting- and Ground-types. With Spikes on Skarmory and Stealth Rock on Heatran, they can put huge entry hazard pressure on almost any team. Defensive Celesteela is a valuable teammate that can use Leech Seed to restore Heatran's health. It is also a great check to non-Gravity Landorus. However, its poor longevity compared to Skarmory makes it a lesser option. To complete the defensive core, Ferrothorn is one of the best checks to Water-types for Steel teams and should almost always be used along with Heatran for their amazing type synergy. Ferrothorn also appreciates having Heatran carry Stealth Rock so that it can use other utility moves such as Knock Off. Defensive Mega Scizor is an amazing pivot that many Fire-types switch into, which Mega Scizor can then U-turn out to bring in Heatran. It can also run options such as Defog and Pursuit, which support Heatran by either removing annoying Spikes or trapping Pokemon like Latios. Excadrill is another good hazard remover that can also check opposing Heatran if you choose not to use Stone Edge. Since this set cannot take on Mega Sableye, Excadrill's Mold Breaker Toxic is also very useful and can also cripple Pokemon such as Mew and Porygon2 if Heatran doesn't pack it.</p> "

Earth Power provides valuable coverage for many key targets like Toxapex, Tyranitar, Nihilego, and opposing Heatran. Taunt lets Heatran shut down passive walls like Toxapex that it has trapped, preventing them from from using healing moves or setting entry hazards while Heatran whittles them down. Flash Cannon serves as a more reliable secondary STAB move and lets Heatran reliably OHKO Mega Diancie, as well as KOing other Rock-types such as Shuckle more easily. Toxic is an option over Flash Cannon to cripple walls like Porygon2 and Mantine by putting them on a timer, letting Heatran stallbreak more effectively. Heatran can serve as a Stealth Rock user if the team needs one, but other Pokemon typically fulfill this role on Fire teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs increase Heatran's offensive presence, while 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let it outspeed threats like Adamant Diggersby and Timid Volcanion as well as Speed tie with other Timid Heatran. Air Balloon protects Heatran from Ground-type attacks until it is hit once, giving it more survivability early-game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Heatran should be switched into passive walls that can't deal major damage to it like Staraptor and Mandibuzz in order to trap them. Magma Storm's residual damage and trapping makes it easily spammable and hard to switch into, dealing solid chunks of damage even to Pokemon that resist it like Garchomp and Azumarill, and it should be used liberally when Heatran has a free turn. Magma Storm's residual damage combined with Taunt can also let Heatran trap and slowly wear down bulky walls like Chansey and Toxapex. Taunt prevents Heatran's team from being worn down by stopping Pokemon like Armaldo from setting Stealth Rock. It also prevents Pokemon such as Zapdos from Defogging if you have set Stealth Rock. It is important to preserve Heatran's Air Balloon so it can deal with certain threats like Hippowdon on Ground teams and Mega Diancie on Fairy teams, which can OHKO Heatran after it is popped. Heatran should avoid getting paralyzed, as it is unable to effectively stallbreak walls when it cannot use Taunt before they heal. It is important to keep Heatran healthy enough to check a threat like Choice Scarf Nihilego in the Poison matchup; Heatran is very instrumental against these teams because it can trap Toxapex and check Nihilego and should be played carefully against them and kept healthy early-game. If Heatran is carrying Toxic, it should be used on a bulky target trapped by Magma Storm like Chansey, Porygon2, or Mantine so the rest of the team can deal with the foe more easily, as well as to cripple threats such as Swampert and Tyranitar that can force Heatran out as they switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran serves as a good offensive check to Rock-types as well as an effective stallbreaker, making it a good choice on any Fire team. Torkoal compresses several roles by removing entry hazards, functioning as a physical wall, and setting sun and Stealth Rock. Heatran greatly appreciates the sun weakening Water-type attacks so that it can trap Pokemon like Toxapex more easily. Infernape and Victini with either Choice Scarf or Choice Band can serve as revenge killers or physical wallbreakers, helping against Dark and Normal teams, and both can lure in checks like Toxapex and bring in Heatran with U-turn to trap them. Blacephalon serves as a powerful special attacker that appreciates Heatran's ability to soften up special walls like Chansey and Mantine, as well as Heatran's ability to switch into Choice Scarf Latios to aid the Psychic matchup. Mega Charizard X and Volcarona are potent setup sweepers that can clean teams late-game and appreciate Heatran's ability to trap and weaken checks like Porygon2. Mega Charizard Y and Volcanion are powerful special wallbreakers that can help deal with Water-types like Keldeo for Heatran, with Solar Beam and Water Absorb, respectively. In return, Heatran can trap and weaken their defensive checks like Mantine. Rotom-H serves as a good switch-in to Ground- and Electric-types, which Heatran struggles with, while also being able to bring Heatran in safely with Volt Switch.</p> "

  "Hawlucha": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Hawlucha has solid niches on Fighting teams as a Defogger and as a sweeper. As a Defogger, Hawlucha's high Speed allows it to reliably remove entry hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes while also outspeeding most fast Taunt users like Krookodile and Cobalion. Its Flying typing also allows it to switch into almost all entry hazards safely and gives it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, while its combination of high-powered STAB attacks allows it to threaten and potentially force out opposing hazard setters and Defoggers such as Araquanid and Decidueye, giving it a good offensive presence. As a sweeper, Hawlucha helps pressure Grass- and Bug-types like Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, Heracross, and Araquanid with its powerful Flying-type STAB move in Acrobatics, and it can use its STAB attacks to serve as a powerful cleaner against types such as Dark, Grass, Bug, and even Steel. On top of this, Hawlucha utilizes Substitute and Swords Dance in order to set up in front of passive Pokemon like Cradily and utility Mew, which makes it a very threatening sweeper. Regardless of its set, Hawlucha's impressive Speed stat and access to Unburden allow it to outspeed the entire metagame, including all Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Gengar and weather sweepers like Sand Rush Excadrill, after Unburden activates. Even without the boost from Unburden, Hawlucha can still outspeed and threaten Pokemon such as Heracross and Mega Gallade. However, Hawlucha sports horrendous 78 / 75 / 63 bulk, which does not allow it to survive many strong attacks; however, Hawlucha's bulk does prevent its Substitute from being broken by most weak moves such as Mega Sableye's Knock Off and Klefki's unboosted Foul Play. Hawlucha is the only Defogger on Fighting, but it still can end up being dead weight in certain matchups like Flying and Electric due to its lack of offensive presence against these types. Despite its offensive perks, Hawlucha heavily relies on Swords Dance in order to do respectable damage to its targets due to its relatively low base 92 Attack. Along with that, it fights for a teamslot on Fighting as a sweeper with Kommo-o because Kommo-o is a more reliable sweeper that can set up more quickly and assist with more matchups than Hawlucha such as against Psychic and Electric.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Hawlucha is a great addition to hyper offensive Flying teams, as its ability Unburden backed by Swords Dance and its powerful STAB attacks allows it to act as a good setup sweeper. Thanks to Unburden it single-handedly becomes the fastest Pokemon in the metagame. Its part Fighting typing allows it to act as a dangerous wincon against many types such as Ice, Normal, Steel, and Dark and lets it take on a plethora of threatening Pokemon, such as Kyurem-B, Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, for the team. Thanks to Substitute, Hawlucha can easily set up on defensive Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mew, as it can evade their status and weak attacks and safely set up Swords Dance behind Substitute. However, even though Hawlucha is a fantastic setup sweeper, before Unburden is activated, fast Pokemon such as Greninja and Choice Scarf Latios to outspeed it, and Hawlucha is also very weak without a Swords Dance boost. Additionally, its poor defensive stats make it difficult for Hawlucha to find opportunities to set up, especially against offensive teams that constantly apply pressure to Hawlucha. This also leaves it weak to the common priority users of the tier such as Dragonite, Mega Scizor, and Azumarill.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Drain Punch is an option over High Jump Kick for more consistent accuracy on the Substitute + Swords Dance set. However, by doing this, Hawlucha will be unable to OHKO Pokemon such as Excadrill and Mamoswine. The Swords Dance set can also use Power Herb over Sitrus Berry and use Sky Attack over Substitute in order to set up more quickly against offensive teams, but using this leaves Hawlucha open to status moves.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Hawlucha has no other viable options.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users: Pokemon like Mega Scizor, Mega Pinsir, and Dragonite threaten Hawlucha with their powerful priority moves, as Hawlucha has difficulty taking hits, especially if it has already set up.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon like Clefable and Zapdos can take hits from Hawlucha and wear it down with super effective STAB attacks as well as recover their lost health with recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users: Pokemon like Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Toxapex can deal with Hawlucha's STAB moves even after a Swords Dance. On top of that, these Pokemon can also remove Hawlucha's boosts with Haze or force it out with Roar or Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon: Many revenge killers can eliminate Hawlucha due to its lack of bulk if it has not yet activated Unburden or does not have a Substitute up. Pokemon like Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Scarf Nihilego, Choice Scarf Togekiss, and Life Orb Greninja can OHKO Hawlucha if it does not have a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Most Pokemon on Electric like Tapu Koko, Alolan Raichu, and Rotom-W generally threaten Hawlucha because of their super effective STAB moves and resistance to Flying-type attacks making it harder for Hawlucha to find opportunities to set up.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Hawlucha is rather frail and can only set up against weaker attackers. Any super effective coverage makes it near impossible for Hawlucha to set up and sweep.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Hippowdon and Zapdos can easily tank Hawlucha's attacks and deal with it either through phazing or hitting it with super effective damage, then healing damage done with their recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Azumarill, Mega Scizor, and Dragonite can easily pick off Hawlucha because of its poor bulk. However, if Hawlucha has set up and these Pokemon have been chipped and are not in range of killing Hawlucha with their priority attacks, it can pick them off with its powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status: All forms of status hinder Hawlucha, as paralysis cripples its speed, poison cripples its longevity, and burns cripple its Attack stat, making it harder to break past other Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Before Hawlucha has activated Unburden, faster Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Latios, and Greninja can easily pick it off.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze users: Phazers and Haze users such as Hippowdon and Toxapex can prevent Hawlucha from sweeping, as the former forces Hawlucha out of battling, negating all its boosts, and the latter resets all of Hawlucha's boosts, preventing it from properly being able to set up.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Offensive Defogger (Fighting)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Defog lets Hawlucha take advantage of its high Speed to reliably remove entry hazards for Fighting; Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes are the most notable hazards, as they can otherwise harm the offensive presence of the team. Sky Attack, with the help of a Power Herb, is used as Hawlucha's way of activating Unburden with a powerful one-turn STAB attack. Due to the high Base Power of this move, Hawlucha can severely dent or KO a threat like Galvantula after Stealth Rock damage and proceed to activate Unburden, which can let it further threaten the opposing team offensively. Acrobatics is Hawlucha's most consistent STAB attack, and once Power Herb has been consumed, it is able to deal heavy damage to opposing Pokemon that are weak to it such as Breloom, Tapu Bulu, Heracross, and Infernape. High Jump Kick is Hawlucha's Fighting-type STAB attack, and because of its consistently high Base Power, it is able to pressure Pokemon such as Nihilego and Choice Specs Hydreigon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs are put into Attack, which lets Hawlucha OHKO Pokemon like Excadrill and Choice Band Tapu Bulu. 252 EVs are put into Speed so Hawlucha can outpace and use Defog against Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Life Orb Latios. Power Herb is used so that Sky Attack can be used in one turn, and it activates Unburden once it is consumed. Unburden is used so that Hawlucha can outspeed Pokemon like Jolly Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Greninja. A Jolly nature is used so that Hawlucha can outspeed threats like Galvantula without the boost from Unburden.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Sky Attack is the only way to activate Unburden, and Hawlucha can use this against Pokemon weak to the move so that it can activate the ability while removing a threat or a weakened Pokemon such as Celebi or Mega Gallade. Defog should be used when the opposing entry hazard setters have fainted, as Hawlucha is frail and cannot afford to frequently come in against matchups where entry hazards are common such as Poison and Water. Sending Hawlucha in on a weakened hazard setter like Galvantula or Araquanid can force them to switch out, allowing Hawlucha to Defog for free. Pokemon that are Choice-locked into a move that Hawlucha can manage, such as Choice Scarf Heracross using Close Combat and Choice Scarf Excadrill using Earthquake or Rapid Spin, allow Hawlucha to come in and Defog as well. Refrain from sending Hawlucha in on Pokemon with status-inducing moves, as any status ailment will hinder Hawlucha's usability. Hawlucha should also not be sacrificed or switched into strong attackers, as not only is its bulk abysmal, but Hawlucha's role in removing hazards is important enough in matchups like Rock and Bug that it needs to be preserved. Hawlucha must be wary of bulky setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Latias, as they can take advantage of its lackluster power and use it as a chance to set up. Hawlucha should try to activate Unburden if the entire enemy team is weakened to the point that it can clean; alternatively, it can be activated to outspeed a fast threat like Choice Scarf Latios so Hawlucha can use Defog before getting revenge killed. Also, avoid activating Unburden if any of Hawlucha's checks or counters are still active, as it can only be activated once and disappears once Hawlucha switches out. Hawlucha can also bluff having the Substitute + Swords Dance set, which can allow it to KO unsuspecting Pokemon such as Mega Gallade and Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cobalion can provide Thunder Wave support, which lets Hawlucha outspeed threats such as Greninja and Mega Lopunny before activating Unburden. This lets Hawlucha threaten these Pokemon and clear entry hazards much more easily. Cobalion also switches into Fairy-, Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-type moves for Hawlucha thanks to its better bulk and good defensive typing. Infernape can use its Fire-type moves to take out Celesteela and Skarmory, which would otherwise force Hawlucha out. Breloom likes to preserve its Focus Sash, so it appreciates Hawlucha removing any hazards so that it is able to switch in without taking any chip damage. In return, Breloom can put Hawlucha's threats to sleep with Spore and KO fast threats to Hawlucha like Mega Sharpedo and Greninja with Mach Punch. Choice Scarf Terrakion appreciates Hawlucha's ability to remove Sticky Web immensely, as Sticky Web would otherwise prevent it from eliminating threats like Mega Diancie, Life Orb Greninja, and Tapu Koko after Stealth Rock damage. Mega Gallade appreciates Hawlucha's ability to remove Toxic Spikes, as this allows it to set up more easily against Water- and Poison-type and take down walls like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Kommo-o also appreciates Hawlucha's ability to remove Toxic Spikes so that it can remain healthy and set up more easily; it can also KO bulky hazard setters like Forretress and Ferrothorn with Flamethrower, allowing Hawlucha to permanently remove the hazards once given the opportunity. Keldeo can break physical walls like Hippowdon and Mega Sableye so that Hawlucha will not be forced to switch out when it tries to sweep. Heracross can take advantage of Hawlucha's ability to remove Reflect, and it can make the Psychic matchup a little easier because it can threaten Psychic-types like Mew and Latios with Pursuit and Megahorn to ease Hawlucha's attempts at sweeping.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance (Fighting)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute helps lower Hawlucha's HP so that it can consume its Sitrus Berry, which then activates Unburden and boosts the power of Acrobatics. This can also be used to avoid status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Swords Dance boosts Hawlucha's Attack by two stages, letting it OHKO the likes of Mega Venusaur and Alolan Muk. Acrobatics is Hawlucha's Flying-type STAB attack; once Hawlucha's Sitrus Berry is consumed, Acrobatics doubles in power, allowing it to OHKO most Grass- and Bug-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Volcarona. High Jump Kick is Hawlucha's Fighting-type STAB move, and it packs a punch against Pokemon like Nihilego and Greninja.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>30 HP IVs are used to make Hawlucha's HP divisible by 4, allowing it to use Substitute twice to activate its Sitrus Berry. Hawlucha uses 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs to maximize its power and Speed; it runs a Jolly nature due to how crucial its Speed tier is when revenge killing Pokemon like Keldeo and Mega Gallade before Unburden has activated. A Sitrus Berry gives Hawlucha a decent amount of recovery, and it boosts Hawlucha's Acrobatics and activates Unburden after it is consumed. A Sitrus Berry is used over another healing Berry to lower the number of turns required to activate Unburden with Substitute.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hawlucha works best as a late-game sweeper, aiming to clean up once defensive threats such as Landorus-T and Toxapex have been eliminated or severely weakened. It is necessary to preserve Hawlucha's Sitrus Berry until this time, as Hawlucha will not be able to tap into its Unburden ability after switching out when it has activated. Without the boost from Unburden, Hawlucha is not able to outspeed certain threats to Fighting like Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Gengar. The small health boost from the Sitrus Berry allows Hawlucha to potentially set up Substitute again after activating Unburden to deal with offensive threats or to tank a weak attack in order to get a KO in return. Sending in Hawlucha against passive Pokemon like Cradily, utility Mew, and Gliscor allows it to set up Substitute for free and potentially get a Swords Dance as they either switch out or continue to try and break the Substitute. Refrain from sending Hawlucha into strong attacks, as it cannot take good hits due to its lackluster bulk; instead reserve it for revenge killing. Also refrain from sending Hawlucha into status inducers and Scald users, as any status ailment can compromise Hawlucha's longevity. Be wary of Pokemon that use Protect like Celesteela and Mega Sharpedo when Hawlucha needs to use High Jump Kick, as the crash damage will severely dent Hawlucha and potentially KO it. Hawlucha should set up Substitute before using Swords Dance if it is up against a slow status inducer such as Mega Sableye; however, if the foe is Choice-locked into an exploitable move like Choice Scarf Excadrill locked into Earthquake or Rapid Spin, Hawlucha can afford to set up Swords Dance first and use Substitute later to set up on a different Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cobalion and Infernape both support Hawlucha with their ability to set Stealth Rock to weaken opposing Pokemon. Cobalion specifically helps slow down threats with Thunder Wave and can switch into attacks that Hawlucha would not like to take thanks to its superior bulk, while Infernape can eliminate Celesteela and Skarmory with its Fire-type STAB attacks. Mega Gallade helps eliminate tanky Haze users like Toxapex and Mantine that would otherwise make Hawlucha's job harder to pull off. Keldeo can assist with getting rid of physical walls that would give Hawlucha a hard time such as Slowbro, Skarmory, and Mega Sableye. It also helps serve as a way of dealing with Mega Scizor. Choice Scarf Terrakion outspeeds common threats to Hawlucha such as Choice Scarf Togekiss, Life Orb Greninja, and Choice Scarf Victini. Terrakion also has the coverage to help KO Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Mega Diancie, which otherwise give Hawlucha a hard time. Breloom can put Pokemon to sleep, giving Hawlucha an opportunity to set up. It can also eliminate some problematic Pokemon like Hippowdon and Slowbro with its Grass-type attacks, and its access to Mach Punch allows it to OHKO threats to Hawlucha like Choice Band Diggersby and Choice Scarf Greninja without needing to worry about Speed because of its priority. Despite fighting for a teamslot, Choice Scarf Heracross can be used with Hawlucha, as it can help eliminate troubling Psychic-types like Mewnium Z Mew and Life Orb Latios with its powerful Bug-type STAB attacks. Kommo-o can be used alongside Hawlucha to eliminate bulky Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Skarmory with its coverage moves, allowing Hawlucha to sweep weaker Pokemon with ease.</p> "

High Jump Kick is Hawlucha's strongest STAB attack and deals with various threats to Flying teams such as Chansey and Kyurem-B. Acrobatics allows Hawlucha to take on Bug-, Grass-, Fighting-type Pokemon such as Volcarona, Mega Venusaur, and Keldeo. Substitute allows Hawlucha to evade status conditions and is important for activating its Sitrus Berry and, in turn, Unburden.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>30 HP IVs allow Hawlucha to always activate its Sitrus Berry after its second use of Substitute. 252 Attack and 252 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature allow Hawlucha to hit as fast and hard as possible. Unburden doubles Hawlucha's Speed after it has used its item, allowing it to become the fastest Pokemon in the metagame; this also allows Hawlucha to beat Ditto, which is a typical check to a setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hawlucha is best used as a late-game sweeper, as once most of its checks are put in the range of Hawlucha's boosted attacks, it is near impossible to stop. Hawlucha appreciates its counters, such as Toxapex, being removed from the battle and its checks, such as Mega Scizor, to be chipped before it attempts a sweep. Avoid status at all costs, as every form of status severely cripples Hawlucha's ability to act as a setup sweeper. Substitute is a great tool to do so; this also allows it to set up a Swords Dance the next turn for free. Hawlucha should always activate Unburden before trying to set up a sweep, as Acrobatics is severely underpowered before its Sitrus Berry has been activated. Hawlucha should set up a Substitute against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Chansey and Cobalion, and proceed to set up a Swords Dance. Substitute also allows it to activate Sitrus Berry more easily and set up an Unburden sweep. Aim to set up Hawlucha in a matchup such as Normal where it's the teams main wincon after Pokemon such as Staraptor, whose Intimidate can make sweeping more difficult, have been severely weakened or eliminated from battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl is a phenomenal Focus Sash lead Pokemon; with access to Stealth Rock, it chips down Hawlucha's checks each time they switch in and breaks Dragonite's Multiscale, and it can also prevent slower leads from setting Stealth Rock thanks to Taunt. Mega Charizard Y can break past physically defensive walls such as Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Zapdos that can otherwise wall Hawlucha. In return, Hawlucha can break past most of Mega Charizard Y's checks like Chansey. Celesteela and Hawlucha weaken each other's checks, allowing the other to sweep late-game. Celesteela can also act as a wincon in the Fairy matchup, which can otherwise be difficult for Hawlucha. Dragonite and Hawlucha wear down their commonly shared checks. Additionally, Dragonite can break past Pokemon such as Toxapex and Swampert with a boosted Devastating Drake and act as a wincon in the Electric matchup thanks to the combination of Earthquake and Extreme Speed. Both Landorus formes provide an Electric immunity for Hawlucha. Landorus-T acts as a fast Choice Scarf user that can outspeed such threats as Tapu Koko for Hawlucha and can cripple foes by removing their items with Knock Off. Landorus is a fantastic special attacker that can take on an array of threats such as Toxapex, Skarmory, and Klefki. Thundurus-T provides an Electric immunity and acts as an offensive pivot that can bring in Hawlucha with Volt Switch. It can also break Water- and Flying-type Pokemon that give Hawlucha trouble such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Celesteela.</p> "

It also has a great ability in Sturdy along with access to Roar, which allows it to almost always phaze setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona if at full HP. However, Avalugg has a terrible Special Defense stat, which leaves it susceptible to special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko. It is also weak to common Fire-, Rock-, and Fighting-type attacks, which hinders its longevity in battle and makes it much harder to remove entry hazards. Avalugg is also extremely slow, even for a defensive Pokemon, and is outsped by the entire metagame, meaning it often needs to take a hit before attacking and is susceptible to Taunt users such as Smeargle and Gyarados. Avalugg is also weak to Stealth Rock, which makes its job of removing hazards extremely difficult.</p> ",

Roar enables Avalugg to force out setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Mega Scizor, which would otherwise utilize it as setup bait. Avalanche is used to ensure that Avalugg has an offensive presence by taking advantage of Avalugg's poor Speed, but it is extremely weak if Avalugg isn't attacked.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full HP investment allows Avalugg to be as bulky as possible, while maximum Defense investment along with an Impish nature bolsters Avalugg's Defense stat. Sturdy is the preferred ability because it allows Avalugg to take any hit when at full health, allowing it to consistently phaze setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Leftovers allows Avalugg to recover a bit of its HP each turn, increasing its longevity. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can be used to punish Pokemon the utilize contact moves such as U-turn Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to switch Avalugg in on a predicted use of Stealth Rock because it prevents Avalugg from taking unnecessary Stealth Rock damage. Preserve Avalugg's HP because it needs to be at full health to take powerful physical attacks. If Avalugg is running Rocky Helmet, it should switch into U-turn users such as Landorus-T and Jirachi. It should not stay in against special attackers, as its Special Defense stat is extremely poor. Use Roar to phaze setup sweepers that threaten Ice-type teams such as Mega Scizor and Mega Gyarados. Avoid status, specifically burn and poison, because a burn halves Avalugg's otherwise decent Attack stat, while poison slowly wears it down, hindering its ability to wall certain threats. If there is a Ghost-type on the opponent's team, it is usually best to avoid using Rapid Spin until it is eliminated so that Avalugg doesn't lose momentum. Pivot Avalugg into physical attackers such as Heracross and Landorus-T so that it can either use Recover or threaten them with Avalanche.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Avalugg fits on all Ice-type teams because of its ability to reliably remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil, making up for Avalugg's terrible Special Defense stat. It also can check Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion for Avalugg with its Fairy-type attacks. Mamoswine can check Fire-types that threaten Avalugg and has access to Stealth Rock, forming a hazard control core. This allows Ice-type teams to force Flying- and Fire-type teams to use Defog, making Avalugg's job much easier. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can check Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran for Avalugg. Piloswine switches into physical and special attacks, making it much easier for Avalugg to remove hazards. It also can set up Stealth Rock, forming a hazard control core and giving Avalugg's Roar extra utility. Weavile can trap Psychic-types that threaten Avalugg such as Victini and Latios with Pursuit, while Avalugg can check physical attackers that threaten Weavile. Walrein and Lapras can take Steel- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Heatran for Avalugg. Rapid Spin support from Avalugg allows Cloyster to preserve its Focus Sash, allowing it to safely set up with Shell Smash. Rotom-F can cripple Mega Scizor with Will-O-Wisp. It also has Volt Switch, which allows Avalugg to be brought in safely. Avalugg allows Alolan Sandslash to run Earthquake instead of Rapid Spin so that it can KO Heatran.</p> "

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is one of Electric's deadliest wallbreakers and revenge killers due to its amazing Electric / Fairy STAB combination and its ability to amplify the power of Electric-type moves through Electric Surge. Fairy-type STAB is amazing for Tapu Koko, as it can reliably threaten Dragon-types like Kommo-o, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon that are often very problematic for Electric teams to handle. Its blistering base 130 Speed tier allows it to outspeed unboosted threats such as Latios, Mega Gallade, and Dugtrio. It's a staple for all Electric teams, as the Electric Terrain provided by Electric Surge boosts the power of all Electric-type moves by 50%. Electric Terrain also provides smaller niches in preventing Spore and Sleep Powder from Breloom and Mega Venusaur from affecting all grounded Pokemon. Tapu Koko can also function as a powerful anti-lead option with Taunt to shut down entry hazard setters and setup sweepers and Volt Switch or U-turn to provide offensive momentum for itself and its teammates. However, despite being powerful, Tapu Koko is quite frail, and can often be KOed by threats such as Tapu Bulu and +2 Mega Scizor. Because Electric teams constantly rely on Tapu Koko's ability to set the Electric Terrain, it must be switched in very often to keep offensive pressure, which can be taken advantage of by the opponent.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is the fastest Pokemon available to Fairy teams, being able to outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame. It also works as a fantastic offensive pivot, as it is able to gain momentum with U-turn. Due to its great Speed, it is also a fantastic revenge killer, which allows it to take on typical threats to Fairy such as Landorus, and Taunt allows it to shut down nearly every wall and prevent them from recovering off damage or prevent Pokemon such as Jirachi from setting up Stealth Rock. It is also blessed with a great offensive typing, allowing it to take on key threats to Fairy such as Celesteela. Tapu Koko is extremely valuable in the Water- and Flying-type matchup, as it can take on common threats such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Celesteela. However, Tapu Koko's Special Attack is lackluster when it isn't using Electric STAB moves, as it can't even OHKO Pokemon such as Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice, leaving it reliant on Thunderbolt to get across notable damage. Its lackluster bulk also leaves much to be desired, allowing it to be revenge killed rather easily by priority move users like Dragonite, faster Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, or bulky attackers that can take it on like Kyurem-B.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>Grass Knot can be use in tandem with Hidden Power Ice on Choice Specs variants of Tapu Koko, as it allows Tapu Koko to better threaten Ground teams if Magnezone manages to successfully trap and kill Excadrill. However, Grass Knot does more damage exclusively to these foes and does not guarantee an OHKO on them, and it also comes at the cost of Volt Switch or Dazzling Gleam; the former is important to pivot out of situations, and the latter is just as important to threaten Dragon teams effectively. U-turn acts as a substitute to Volt Switch on the Choice Specs set that cannot be blocked by Ground-type foes, especially Dugtrio, which can trap Tapu Koko if locked into an Electric-type move. However, U-turn is considerably less powerful than Volt Switch due to the lack of bonus power from STAB or Electric Terrain and makes Tapu Koko more susceptible to contact damage from Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Koko has a ton of other options, making it rather unpredictable. It can run Choice Specs, which allows it to act as a fantastic special wallbreaker, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon like Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice and enabling it to effectively run Dazzling Gleam in order to take on Pokemon that would otherwise wall it such as Kyurem-B. However, in matchups such as Flying, being locked into a move can leave it taken advantage of, making it less reliable. Shuca Berry allows Tapu Koko to take on Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T by letting it take one Ground-type attack and 2HKO them in return with Hidden Power Ice. Grass Knot allows Tapu Koko to take on Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Gastrodon for its team. However, if Tapu Koko runs Grass Knot, it forgoes using Taunt, which allows walls such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur to easily recover off their health against it.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Several bulky Ground-types are able to take on most of Tapu Koko's attacks. Mega Garchomp, Gliscor, Hippowdon and Excadrill all survive most of Tapu Koko's coverage attacks easily and threaten to KO in return with Earthquake. However, Gliscor has to look out for Hidden Power Ice. Gastrodon and bulky Swampert could prove to be problems as well if Tapu Koko is not running Grass Knot. Furthermore, Tapu Koko cannot pivot out with Volt Switch, forcing it to use either the rare u-turn or hard switch out, resulting in the loss of momentum.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Although Hidden Power Ice can help handle Grass-type teams, certain Grass-types, namely Cradily and Ferrothorn, can switch into any of Tapu Koko's attacks without fear of taking too much damage. However, they have to be wary of Taunt, as it can prevent them from using status, healing or hazards moves. Mega Venusaur, though, is able to wall Tapu Koko completely and threaten to KO it with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak: Alolan Marowak is able to wall Tapu Koko completely thanks to its ability Lightning Rod preventing Tapu Koko from even getting momentum with Volt Switch. It resists U-turn, Dazzling Gleam, and Hidden Power Ice and generally forces Tapu Koko to switch out. This provides it opportunities to set up entry hazards or fire off a really powerful STAB move against anything that tries to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn is able to tank any of Tapu Koko's moves with its great special bulk, including Grass Knot. Furthermore, it can regain its health when switched into an Electric-type move from Tapu Koko with Volt Absorb. It may then support its teammates with Heal Bell or gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Several special walls such as Tyranitar, Chansey, Dragalge, and Alolan Muk do not fear Tapu Koko's attacks, and usually force it to switch out. However, they must be wary of Taunt from the utility set, as it can prevent them from regaining HP or setting up hazards before Tapu Koko U-turns out into a suitable answer.</p> <p><strong>Weather Sweepers: Kingdra and Excadrill are quite troublesome for Tapu Koko. Kingdra in rain and Excadrill in sand both outspeed Tapu Koko, thanks to Swift Swim and Sand Rush, and both are able to OHKO Tapu Koko with Surf and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Although Tapu Koko is pretty fast, it is outsped by a lot of prominent Choice Scarf users, such as Terrakion, Excadrill, and Mamoswine, all of which carry Earthquake. Its bulk isn't the best either, and although it resists Breloom's Mach Punch and Bisharp's Sucker Punch, it is still prone to being revenge killed by the likes of Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Since Tapu Koko's main role on an Electric team is to set Electric Terrain as often as possible, it is prone to being worn down by entry hazards, as it receives chip damage every time it switches in. This affects its longevity, reducing the number of times it is able to set Terrain for its team.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Excadrill, Gastrodon, and Swampert are immune to Tapu Koko's strongest attack and can OHKO it with their STAB attacks. However, other Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Gliscor need to be wary of Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Answers: Electric-, Grass-, and Dragon-type Pokemon all resist Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, which it relies on for dealing any notable damage. Many bulky Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Cradily, and Mega Latias can also easily tank Tapu Koko's other attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Chansey and Tyranitar can easily switch into any of Tapu Koko's attacks. However, they need to be wary of Taunt, as Chansey will not be able to recover off damage, and neither will be able to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Greninja can outspeed Tapu Koko and revenge kill it with their coverage moves such as Earthquake and Gunk Shot. Priority users such as Dragonite can easily pick off Tapu Koko with slight chip damage due to its lackluster defensive stats.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Choice Specs (Electric)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is the most reliable special Electric-type move in Tapu Koko's arsenal, and its power is greatly amplified with Electric Terrain. Volt Switch is used primarily as a pivoting tool that allows Electric teams to keep offensive pressure and momentum. Hidden Power Ice deals with Ground- and Grass-types such as Landorus and Rotom-C that would otherwise comfortably take Tapu Koko's Electric-type STAB attacks. Dazzling Gleam is Tapu Koko's best Fairy-type STAB attack, striking down problematic Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Mega Altaria that Electric teams would otherwise struggle against.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment paired with Choice Specs and Electric Terrain makes Tapu Koko a very potent wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed threats such as Dugtrio and Alakazam. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into Defense so that Tapu Koko has just enough bulk to take an Earthquake from uninvested Gliscor. Electric Surge is very crucial, as all Electric-type moves from grounded Pokemon are boosted by 50% under the summoned Electric Terrain. Choice Specs significantly boosts the power of Tapu Koko's attacks; however, locking it into a move that the foe resists can be taken advantage of by opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Tapu Koko, it is often important to lead with it, as setting Electric terrain early sets itself and its teammates up for success by applying immediate offensive pressure. Be cautious of other Terrain setters such as Tapu Bulu and Mewnium Z Mew. While the latter requires a good amount of setup in order to function, the former can immediately be switched into Tapu Koko, switching the Terrain and lessening the prowess of Electric-types overall. Tapu Koko needs to continuously pivot out through the use of Volt Switch in order to keep momentum and reset the Electric Terrain if necessary. Tapu Koko also functions well as a revenge killer, so bring it in on slower, weakened foes and pivot out with Volt Switch to maintain momentum while also taking minimal damage from the opposing Pokemon's attacks. Tapu Koko is very threatening to Dragon teams for its capability to revenge kill nearly any unboosted Dragon-type such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, or Garchomp with the combination of Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Ice. Pivoting back and forth between Tapu Koko and its teammates through VoltTurn is also beneficial gradually chip at the foe, as well as to escape foes looking to switch into Tapu Koko such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur and swap to a teammate such as Magnezone or Alolan Raichu that could better handle them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Raichu benefits the most from Tapu Koko's Electric Surge, as its Speed is doubled under Electric Terrain, letting it take on revenge killers that would otherwise threaten Tapu Koko in a one-on-one scenario, such as Choice Scarf Greninja, Choice Scarf Nihilego, and Sand Rush Excadrill under sand. In return, Tapu Koko deals with Dark-types such as Mega Sableye that Alolan Raichu can't easily break. Rotom-W provides an excellent defensive partner for Tapu Koko to pivot out to, as it is able to avoid Ground-type moves through Levitate, retaliates against them with Hydro Pump, and cripples physical threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Garchomp through the use of Will-O-Wisp. Zapdos is another physically defensive partner that can avoid Ground-type attacks while also checking physical setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Tapu Bulu because of its excellent defensive typing. It also provides solid Defog support for Tapu Koko, allowing it to take as little damage as possible from them. Magnezone is able to trap problematic Steel-types such as Excadrill, Celesteela, Klefki, and Ferrothorn and revenge kill them with Hidden Power Fire or an Electric-type move. The former two are especially important to trap, as Choice Scarf Excadrill has the capacity to revenge kill Tapu Koko with Earthquake, while Celesteela can scout for any move Tapu Koko locks itself into by using Protect. Alolan Golem provides solid Stealth Rock support that can break Focus Sashes and chip opposing Pokemon for Tapu Koko to sweep. Alolan Golem also provides physical prowess for Electric teams, being able to check specially defensive Pokemon that Tapu Koko can't break through easily, such as Chansey and Alolan Muk. Thundurus is a mixed attacker that can assist Tapu Koko in besting Steel teams with the combination of Superpower and Thunderbolt while also having the potential to play a support role through Prankster Thunder Wave and Taunt. The combination of Thundurus and Tapu Koko forms a fast, offensive VoltTurn core as a result. Zeraora is one of the few physical attackers available to Electric teams, and it is greatly appreciated in the Normal matchup due to its combination of Knock Off and Close Combat.</p> "

        "name": "Utility (Electric)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's most reliable Electric-type STAB move and is very powerful when paired with the effects of Electric Surge. Hidden Power Ice is a coverage option against Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus that prove to be problematic for Electric teams. Taunt acts as an anti-lead option, preventing entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Sticky Web from Chansey and Ribombee, setup from Mega Latias and Volcarona, and utility moves such as Zapdos's Substitute and Toxic. U-turn is the main pivoting option over Volt Switch, enabling Tapu Koko to pivot out of foes such as Dugtrio, which can trap Tapu Koko and take advantage of it for using an Electric-type move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs allow Tapu Koko to hit as hard and fast as possible. The last 4 Defense EVs prevent Gliscor from OHKOing Tapu Koko with Earthquake. A Timid nature permits Tapu Koko to Speed tie with Aerodactyl and Crobat while also outspeeding Greninja and Dugtrio. Magnet provides extra power to an already Electric Terrain-boosted Thunderbolt, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard without worrying about recoil damage from a Life Orb. Electric Surge is Tapu Koko's only usable ability, setting up Electric Terrain and boosting all Electric-type moves by 50%.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is generally a great lead, since it can set Electric Terrain, shut down utility foes such as Chansey and Forretress with Taunt, and pivot out of unfavorable lead matchups with U-turn because it's naturally faster than almost everything. However, other Terrain setters such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, and Mewnium Z Mew can remove Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain. Also, the Electric Terrain fades away after a few turns. Make sure you pivot out to another teammate consistently to keep your momentum and reset the Terrain if need be. Avoid extra chip damage from entry hazards and status, especially from Toxic Spikes, as consistent exposure to them cripples Tapu Koko and lessens its ability to freely set Electric Terrain. Continuously pivoting out with Tapu Koko and its teammates is key to have the opposing team take constant chip damage and keep momentum. Keeping Electric Terrain up is critical for the success of any Electric team, as this set lacks the power of Choice Specs and relies on its teammates to break faster foes. Because of its natural Speed, Tapu Koko can revenge kill weakened threats with Thunderbolt. While Tapu Koko must constantly provide Electric Terrain for its teammates, it should not take excess damage, especially since its bulk is rather subpar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Raichu benefits immensely with Tapu Koko around, as Electric Terrain doubles its Speed, making it the fastest presence on the field. During the time Electric Terrain is up, Alolan Raichu can check common Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Nihilego as well as weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Alolan Sandslash. Tapu Koko further provides aid by Taunting utility foes and pivoting back to Alolan Raichu, creating opportunities for Alolan Raichu to set up a Nasty Plot. Rotom-W provides Tapu Koko with a check to Ground-types through Hydro Pump, as well as an additional immunity to their STAB attacks in the form of Levitate and the ability to cripple physical attackers such as Scizor and Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp. Zapdos provides Tapu Koko with defensive capabilities, including a very solid defensive typing that ignores Ground-types and Defog support that can remove entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes that can chip away at Tapu Koko. Magnezone traps problematic Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Excadrill through its ability Magnet Pull and proceeds to remove them with Hidden Power Fire. Trapping and knocking out Excadrill is especially important, as Tapu Koko takes a larger support role with this set. Alolan Golem provides Stealth Rock support for Electric teams, breaking Focus Sashes and gradually chipping away at the opposing team. It is also one of the few physical attackers that Electric teams have available, and as such it can break through specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Alolan Muk, a task that Tapu Koko would have difficulty with. In return, Tapu Koko can use Taunt against anti-leads and Defog users looking to prevent Stealth Rock, such as lead Aerodactyl and defensive Mew. Thundurus is another physical attacker available to Electric teams, primarily assisting Tapu Koko in breaking the Normal core of Chansey and Porygon2 through the use of Knock Off and Superpower. It also helps against Steel- and Psychic-types such as Excadrill and Latios. Mega Manectric provides a more immediate answer to physical attackers in the form of Intimidate. Its additional access to Fire-type moves such as Flamethrower and Overheat provides more of an offensive measure to bulkier Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu. Zeraora stands out from others for being incredibly fast, naturally outspeeding offensive threats such as Mega Lopunny. It's greatly appreciated in the Normal matchup for its great Speed and its combination of Knock Off and Close Combat.</p> "

        "name": "Pivot (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's most spammable attack, as it hits very hard, OHKOing threats to Fairy like Celesteela and potentially 2HKOing Zapdos under Electric Terrain. Hidden Power Ice rounds out Thunderbolt's coverage and allows Tapu Koko to hit Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus. U-turn allows Tapu Koko to pivot out of Pokemon it cannot handle such as Hippowdon in order to bring in more ideal teammates such as Tapu Bulu. Taunt prevents walls from recovering off damage or spreading status, prevents entry hazard setters from setting up their hazards, and prevents Pokemon such as Mega Scizor from setting up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum EVs in Special Attack and Speed alongside a Timid nature allow Tapu Koko to hit as hard and fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Alakazam and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. 4 Defense EVs allows Tapu Koko to always take uninvested Gliscor's Earthquake from full health. Electric Surge sets Electric Terrain, boosting the power of its Electric-type moves. Magnet slightly increases the power of Tapu Koko's Electric-type attacks, allowing Thunderbolt to pick up some 2HKOs in Electric Terrain such as Zapdos.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Tapu Koko's great natural Speed, it should be used as a lead, as it can use Taunt to prevent other leads like Cobalion from setting entry hazards, safely pivot out with U-turn, or fire off a powerful attack. Thanks to its function as an anti-lead, it is also a fantastic revenge killer that can clean late-game against teams such as Water once its checks such as Swampert have been removed from battle. At the same time, Tapu Koko should use Taunt to make sure that walls such as Chansey can't recover off damage and setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade can’t set up. If you plan to keep Tapu Koko healthy to use as a sweeper late-game, you should try to keep it as healthy as possible. Therefore, do not let it take unnecessary damage, and avoid status conditions such as burn and poison. Tapu Koko applies an insane amount of pressure against Water and Flying teams and as such should be preserved in those matchups. It should spam Thunderbolt once all Ground-type Pokemon have been removed, namely Gliscor, Landorus-T, Swampert, and Gastrodon. In the Water matchup, Tapu Koko should always pivot out of battle with U-turn while Swampert or Gastrodon is still around to bring in Tapu Bulu to better deal with it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko form a very deadly Flying breaker core, as Tapu Koko can take on threats to Diancie such as Celesteela, while Mega Diancie can spam Diamond Storm and Moonblast against threats such as Zapdos and Dragonite. Mega Diancie can also provide Stealth Rock support, which gives Tapu Koko an easier time to break Pokemon such as Porygon2 late-game. Tapu Bulu takes care of troublesome Ground-type Pokemon for Tapu Koko such as Hippowdon and Swampert, while Tapu Koko can get rid of annoying Flying-types for Tapu Bulu such as Mandibuzz and Celesteela. Swords Dance Tapu Bulu also can break past Poison-type Pokemon for Tapu Koko such as Mega Venusaur with a boosted Zen Headbutt. Mimikyu can break past Psychic-type Pokemon that wall Tapu Koko such as Mega Latias and can sweep late-game against Psychic teams with boosted Shadow Sneak once Tapu Koko has weakened key threats. Mimikyu can also break past special walls that Tapu Koko cannot deal with such as Chansey. Klefki provides Spikes, which wears down Tapu Koko's checks each time they switch in, letting it clean more easily late-game. Tapu Koko also appreciates Klefki's ability to switch into Poison-type attacks such as Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb and Nihilego's Sludge Wave, as well as its dual screens support, since Tapu Koko's natural bulk is rather poor. Azumarill is a fantastic partner for Tapu Koko, as its ability to set up and sweep helps in many matchups Tapu Koko struggles in such as the Ground matchup and allows it to clean late-game with priority Aqua Jet. Clefable can provide Stealth Rock support, wearing down Tapu Koko's checks such as Zapdos and Gliscor on Flying teams and letting Tapu Koko clean more easily late-game. It also can provide some support against Steel-types, as it is able to check Swords Dance-boosted Mega Scizor with Babiri Berry.</p> "

  "Tapu Bulu": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu's excellent Attack stat in conjunction with its Grassy Terrain-boosted STAB attacks makes it a great physical wallbreaker on Fairy teams. It is also able to serve as a revenge killer with Choice Scarf. Its Grass typing allows it to take on Ground, Rock, and Water teams and relieve some of the pressure on Azumarill and Tapu Koko, and it is able to sweep these teams easily with Choice Scarf. Furthermore, Tapu Bulu's access to decent coverage moves such as Superpower, Stone Edge, and Zen Headbutt allows it to check several types in the metagame. With access to Swords Dance and Substitute, Tapu Bulu can put great pressure on defensive Pokemon and cores, easily breaking past types like Normal, Ground, Poison, and Water. Swords Dance-boosted Zen Headbutt notably allows Tapu Bulu to take out many key Poison-type threats to Fairy teams such as Mega Venusaur. Tapu Bulu can utilize Fightinium Z or Rockium Z in conjunction with Swords Dance to break certain Pokemon that would normally check it, such as Ferrothorn for the former and Mandibuzz for the latter. Grassy Surge provides immense support for Fairy teams, giving passive recovery and reducing damage dealt by Earthquake. However, it also recovers the health of the opposing team, which can be disadvantageous. Also, Tapu Bulu has trouble KOing certain physically defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory, even with its amazing wallbreaking power, and it is even more easily walled by them when using Choice Scarf. Tapu Bulu's Grassy / Fairy typing leaves it with a huge weakness to Poison-type attacks, meaning users of such attacks force Tapu Bulu to switch out to Klefki. Finally, Tapu Bulu's subpar Speed stat leaves it outsped by positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, meaning it usually has to take damage before dishing it out, though with a Choice Scarf, it is able to outspeed some of them.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu is the greatest offensive Pokemon available to Grass teams. Its unmatched combination of offensive wallbreaking power and a great ability makes it a crucial option for any Grass team. Grassy Surge brings massive support to itself and the entire team alike by boosting the power of Grass-type moves and providing passive recovery for all grounded Pokemon. It also weakens the power of Ground-type moves. This allows Grass's defensive core, which is entirely neutral to Ground, to have a much easier time checking wallbreakers like Choice Band Excadrill. Because of Tapu Bulu's above-average Attack stat in tandem with its strong Terrain-boosted moves like Wood Hammer, it is able to function as a fearsome wallbreaker and revenge killer for Grass teams. Additionally, Tapu Bulu's decent bulk, passive Grassy Surge recovery, and access to Horn Leech often make it hard to take down. To emphasize this, Tapu Bulu is usually supported by bulky teammates that can give it safe opportunities to come in on the field. However, while its Fairy typing gives Tapu Bulu defensive utility against Dark-, Fighting-, and Dragon-types, it stacks a common weakness to Poison that can be exploited by revenge killers such as Dugtrio. Additionally, Tapu Bulu lacks access to any physical Fairy STAB move, making it often rely on its coverage moves in order to hit threats that resist its Grass STAB moves such as Dragonite. Furthermore, Grass is a bad offensive typing, and this means that Tapu Bulu often finds itself overly reliant on coverage options like Superpower and Stone Edge in order to hit the many threats that resist its STAB attacks. Although it commonly holds a Choice Scarf, Tapu Bulu's below-average Speed and numerous weaknesses allow many of the metagame's common Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Victini to easily revenge kill it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu can use supportive utility moves and Leftovers instead of coverage to cover threats it normally would either require a Z-Crystal to beat or is otherwise walled by. Disable prevents Sludge Bomb Toxapex, Alolan Muk, Celesteela, and many other walls from breaking its Substitute, giving it the opportunity to set up Swords Dance and have a free Substitute. Leech Seed allows Tapu Bulu to stall Celesteela with Substitute, outhealing the damage and preventing Celesteela from healing in return. Taunt prevents slower Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz, from stopping Tapu Bulu from setting up.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>At the expense of much-needed Speed, Tapu Bulu could run a Choice Band set to become a much deadlier wallbreaker that can break through Pokemon that its Choice Scarf set cannot. For example, Wood Hammer from Choice Band Tapu Bulu can 2HKO Porygon2 and OHKO Toxapex after minimal chip damage. This set appreciates another teammate such as Choice Scarf Rotom-C to keep faster foes in check, but Tapu Bulu generally fulfills this role better than Grass's other options. In a similar vein, Tapu Bulu can run a Swords Dance set with a Z-Move in order to lure and KO threats such as Mega Venusaur with Rockium Z and Celesteela with Fightinium Z, but this set misses out on the immediate Speed and Attack that Choice Scarf and Choice Band provide, respectively.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Skarmory and Celesteela: Skarmory and Celesteela completely wall Tapu Bulu because of their excellent defensive typing and bulk. The former can stall Tapu Bulu with Roost and KO it with Brave Bird or Iron Head, and the latter KOes it with Heavy Slam or Flamethrower. Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu has it even worse, being unable to do any sorts of meaningful damage to either.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur walls Tapu Bulu's Grass-type attacks, resists Superpower, doesn't take much damage from Stone Edge, and can OHKO Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb. Tapu Bulu has to rely on Zen Headbutt to deal reasonable damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon such as Nidoking and Gengar can threaten Tapu Bulu with their STAB attacks; however, they need to be wary of Tapu Bulu's Zen Headbutt, and most Poison-types cannot switch into Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Tapu Bulu has to rely on Superpower to beat most Steel-types such as Heatran, Magnezone, and Ferrothorn. Mega Scizor can tank all of its attacks and use it to set up Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Several Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Volcarona, and Talonflame resist Tapu Bulu's Grass-type attacks and can threaten it with their STAB moves. However, they should be wary of switching into a Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types wall Tapu Bulu easily, and many of them, such as Serperior, can take advantage of Grassy Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Revenge killers, especially Choice Scarf users such as Nihilego and Victini, can easily outspeed and KO Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Status: Tapu Bulu doesn't appreciate being inflicted with status; burns heavily diminish its wallbreaking capabilities, poison hurts its longevity, and paralysis reduces its already lacking Speed.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Tapu Bulu struggles to break past Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor, as they resist its STAB moves and can beat it with their own. Other Pokemon such as Heatran can easily force out Tapu Bulu locked into a Grass-type move, but Heatran has to be wary of Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Choice Scarf Nihilego can take advantage of Tapu Bulu's quadruple Poison weakness extremely well and threaten it with their STAB moves. Mega Venusaur specifically is an amazing Tapu Bulu counter, as its quadruple resistance to Grass and excellent physical bulk help it take on Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Tapu Bulu's low natural Speed, faster Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf such as Greninja and Victini can easily outspeed it and take advantage of its various weaknesses.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Pokemon such as Torkoal and Mega Charizard X resist Tapu Bulu's Grass-type moves and can KO it with their own STAB moves, though they must be wary of Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Despite Tapu Bulu's Fairy typing, its lack of a reliable Fairy STAB move makes Pokemon such as Latios and Mega Altaria able to take on Tapu Bulu well by resisting its Grass-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Status: Tapu Bulu's dependence on sheer Attack and Speed makes burns and paralysis especially crippling. While poisoned, it is also easier to wear down due to its tendency to use Wood Hammer often.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Porygon2 can reliably wall and beat Tapu Bulu. Additionally, Grassy Terrain works against Tapu Bulu in these cases, as it gives the opposing Pokemon an additional form of passive recovery.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Swords Dance (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance turns Tapu Bulu into a very threatening wallbreaker, allowing it to collect some important OHKO such as on Toxapex after Stealth Rock chip with Horn Leech. Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's strongest attack and its STAB move, giving it a form of pseudo-recovery and allowing it to take on Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Zen Headbutt allows Tapu Bulu to nail Poison-type threats such as Mega Venusaur for super effective damage. Substitute allows Tapu Bulu to dodge status attacks such as Mega Sableye's Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and maximum Attack investment alongside an Adamant nature allows Tapu Bulu to hit as hard and fast as possible. Life Orb boosts Tapu Bulu's Attack allowing it to pick up important OHKOs such as against Chansey with +2 Horn Leech. Grassy Surge sets Grassy Terrain, boosting the power of its Horn Leech while also weakening the power of Earthquake for teammates such as Mega Diancie and Klefki.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since this Tapu Bulu is meant to be used as a wallbreaker, it should be preserved for specifically that purpose. Take advantage of walls such as Mega Sableye, as Tapu Bulu can easily set up a Substitute on them, which allows it to avoid status and gives it a free turn to set up Swords Dance. This will allow Tapu Bulu to immensely pressure said walls and do serious damage to them. Use Tapu Bulu to switch into predicted Ground-type attacks, as its natural resistance and Grassy Surge allow it to switch into Earthquake fairly easily for its teammates such as Mega Diancie, Klefki, and Tapu Koko. Tapu Bulu naturally pressures any type weak to Grass attacks such as Ground or Water, which Tapu Bulu can easily set up and sweep against. Since both teams rely on defensive walls such as Hippowdon on Ground and Toxapex on Water it can easily set up a Substitute against them and set up a Swords Dance, or just nail them for lots of damage with Horn Leech. In matchups like Water and Poison, where Toxic Spikes are present, Tapu Bulu should try to get in before they are set as it becomes very easily weakened and picked off with the extra chip damage. Since Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu is a fairly common set, it can bluff Choice Scarf against faster Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, set up a Substitute, and proceed to use the Substitute to easily set up Swords Dance. Lastly, just like every other setup sweeper, Tapu Bulu absolutely hates every status condition and should avoid them at all costs because they hinder its ability to sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko can break past Flying-type Pokemon for Tapu Bulu such as Celesteela, prevent walls such as Chansey from using their status moves with Taunt, and constantly bring Tapu Bulu in with its pivoting moves. Klefki can set up screens for Tapu Bulu, allowing it to set up Swords Dance with ease, as well as provide Spikes support to chip foes, allowing Tapu Bulu to pick up OHKOs more easily. Klefki's Foul Play can also check threatening physical setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor that resist both of Tapu Bulu's attacks. Klefki also provides a solid Poison-type immunity for Tapu Bulu, being able to switch into such threats as Nihilego for it. Mega Diancie can break past Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Kommo-o for Tapu Bulu as well as pressure Poison-type Pokemon with Diamond Storm and Psychic, which can 2HKO every Pokemon of the type. Mega Diancie can also pressure Flying teams with Diamond Storm and Moonblast, as only Celesteela can switch into both attacks. It can also set up Stealth Rock allowing Tapu Bulu to clean more easily and pick off threats such as Mega Venusaur with boosted Zen Headbutt after Stealth Rock chip. Mega Diancie is also capable of keeping hazards such as Toxic Spikes off the field for Tapu Bulu thanks to Magic Bounce. Azumarill is another physical setup sweeper on Fairy teams and can take on Fire-type Pokemon for Tapu Bulu such as Blacephalon while also providing Knock Off support to cripple walls such as Porygon2 and Toxapex. Mimikyu is the last of the viable physical setup sweepers that Fairy teams have access to and is extremely useful in the Psychic-type matchup, being able to easily break any Pokemon that can give Tapu Bulu trouble, such as Jirachi, while also being able to take on Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Mega Latias for it. Clefable can compress the role of a Stealth Rock setter and a Steel-type check, as with Fire Blast and a Babiri Berry it can act as an effective check to Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, which easily comes in and takes advantage of Tapu Bulu.</p> "

        "name": "Z-Move Wallbreaker (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Tapu Bulu to raise its Attack stat and become a fearsome wallbreaker. Horn Leech is Tapu Bulu's main wallbreaking STAB attack that heals it, letting it beat walls such as Clefable and Toxapex along with even faster Pokemon like Mega Gallade. Superpower alongside Fightinium Z allows Tapu Bulu to hit Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Heatran, which would otherwise wall it. Stone Edge alongside Rockium Z is another option to hit Mega Charizard X and Y, Tornadus-T, Mandibuzz, and Torkoal. Substitute allows Tapu Bulu to avoid status, take advantage of switches, and safely set up a Swords Dance</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with an Adamant nature ensures Tapu Bulu hits as hard and as fast as possible. Fightinium Z allows Tapu Bulu to OHKO Ferrothorn and Chansey with All-Out Pummeling after Stealth Rock Damage even without a Swords Dance, as well as OHKO Celesteela at +2. Rockium Z allows Tapu Bulu to OHKO Zapdos with Continental Crush and even Torkoal after a Swords Dance. Grassy Surge immediately sets Grassy Terrain for Tapu Bulu, allowing it to wallbreak with Horn Leech and offset Substitute damage, alongside supporting its teammates by giving them passive recovery and halving the damage from Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu should be used as a physical wallbreaker and should take advantage of a passive Pokemon looking to spread status by setting up a Substitute or when forcing a switch. When under a Substitute, Tapu Bulu can look to boost with Swords Dance for free. This allows Tapu Bulu to be a very troublesome wallbreaker to slower teams. Switch in Tapu Bulu on predicted Ground-, Water-, and Electric- type attacks, allowing it to then force the opposing Pokemon out and gain a chance to set up. If Fightinium Z is used, go for All-Out Pummelling against faster threats like Heatran, Excadrill, and Kyurem-B when behind a Substitute to immediately eliminate them; the same goes for Continential Crush against Mega Charizard X and Y, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T if Rockium Z is used, as Tapu Bulu usually lures these Pokemon in expecting to wall it. Tapu Bulu should also preserve its Z-Move for certain Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mandibuzz, as it can OHKO them after a Swords Dance boost. Tapu Bulu can always play around Protect by going for an additional Swords Dance, as there is a possibility that they will scout for the Z-Move. Tapu Bulu cannot afford to take any status, as they all hinder Tapu Bulu's ability to set up effectively. Tapu Bulu can avoid status ailments by setting up a Substitute on an incoming Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye, Toxic from Chansey, or Scald from Mantine and begin to pressure them. In addition, Tapu Bulu should be wary switching into Scald, as that has a chance to burn it permanently.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Almost all Fairy-types, such as Mega Diancie and Klefki, can appreciate Tapu Bulu halving the damage of Earthquake and giving passive recovery to them. Mega Diancie gets rid of Fire- and Flying-types that prevent Tapu Bulu from sweeping and can bounce back Toxic Spikes and status so that they do not hit Tapu Bulu. Mega Diancie can also set Stealth Rock for Tapu Bulu. Tapu Koko can eliminate Pokemon like Skarmory and Celesteela that can give Tapu Bulu a hard time. Tapu Koko can also pivot on Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Swampert, allowing Tapu Bulu to get in safely with U-Turn as they switch into Tapu Koko. Klefki provides dual screen support, Spikes to wear down the opposing team, Foul Play to check Mega Scizor, and Thunder Wave to cripple the Speed of faster Pokemon like Kyurem-B so that Tapu Bulu can outspeed them. Klefki is also a Steel-type that can switch into Poison-type moves such as Gunk Shot and Sludge Bomb, which are huge threats to Tapu Bulu. Clefable sets up Stealth Rock to chip away at the opposing team and can absorb a Toxic or Scald burn thanks to Magic Guard. Azumarill thrives as a teammate, being able to pressure Fire-types and appreciating Tapu Bulu's ability to switch into Electric- type attacks and get rid of its checks such as Seismitoad, Mantine, and Rotom-W. Both Azumarill and Tapu Bulu weaken each others checks, as they are both physical setup sweepers. Mimikyu can get rid of Celebi, Victini, Latios, and Jirachi so that Tapu Bulu can pressure Psychic teams, or Tapu Bulu can weaken the entire team so Mimikyu can clean up at the end.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>STAB Wood Hammer deals massive damage when boosted by Grassy Terrain and is the move Tapu Bulu should use most of the time. Horn Leech is a secondary STAB move that Tapu Bulu should use if it wants to preserve its HP and avoid taking recoil damage, especially if Horn Leech can KO the opposing Pokemon. Superpower is good coverage for taking on Steel-types like Heatran and Magnezone. Stone Edge nails Flying- and Fire-types like Charizard looking to switch into Wood Hammer or Horn Leech.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Tapu Bulu's power. Maximum Speed EVs, a Jolly nature, and a Choice Scarf allow Tapu Bulu to outspeed most unboosted Pokemon in the metagame and fulfill the role of a revenge killer; notable Pokemon it can outspeed are Greninja and Tapu Koko. Grassy Surge is an invaluable ability that boosts the power of Tapu Bulu's STAB attacks, gives its team passive recovery, and weakens Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu should be mostly used as a revenge killer, coming in after a teammate has been KOed to land a hard-hitting Wood Hammer on the opposing team. It is best to revenge kill fast, frail Pokemon like Greninja. Wood Hammer is also a very spammable attack in general and should be used to wallbreak as much as possible. On the other hand, use Horn Leech when Tapu Bulu is low on HP; you should also use Horn Leech when it is sufficient to KO the foe to avoid taking unnecessary recoil. It is helpful to use VoltTurn users to pivot out into Tapu Bulu to attack so it doesn't take unnecessary damage. Tapu Bulu can also be used as an emergency check to some setup sweepers that it outspeeds such as +1 Gyarados and Dragonite. You should aim to keep Grassy Terrain active as often as possible to weaken Earthquake and heal teammates. Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu has an easy time sweeping Water, Rock, and Ground teams with Horn Leech or Wood Hammer, since it is able to outspeed almost everything and its Grassy Terrain-boosted attacks hit very hard. Against Ground teams specifically, be wary of using Wood Hammer if there are no entry hazards on the opposing side, as Focus Sash Dugtrio can sometimes trap and remove Tapu Bulu, and Garchomp is able to survive Wood Hammer without hazard damage and chip away at Tapu Bulu with Rough Skin. However, against other teams, Tapu Bulu has a hard time breaking through physical walls like Porygon2 and Zapdos, so they should be removed before Tapu Bulu starts spamming Wood Hammer to avoid taking unnecessary recoil damage and giving those Pokemon free opportunities to switch in. Use the appropriate coverage move when predicting certain threats to switch into Tapu Bulu, such as Stone Edge when predicting a Flying-type to switch in. Avoid getting Tapu Bulu inflicted with status; burns diminish its power, paralysis ruins its Speed, and poison wears it down so that it is more easily revenge killed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clefable can absorb troublesome status ailments for Tapu Bulu thanks to Magic Guard. It also provides entry hazard support in Stealth Rock and can weaken Steel-types with Fire-type coverage. Mega Diancie can also block status and is a great wallbreaker that can assist Tapu Bulu; in particular, it can check Poison-types, appreciates Tapu Bulu breaking down Steel-types with Superpower, and benefits from Grassy Terrain giving it recovery and weakening Earthquake. Tapu Koko and Mega Gardevoir can deal with the physical walls that trouble Tapu Bulu. Tapu Koko can also continually pivot into Tapu Bulu with U-turn and Volt Switch, weaken foes for Tapu Bulu to revenge kill, and deal with the Flying-types that resist Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer, especially Skarmory and Celesteela. Tapu Bulu deals with Ground-types and other Electric-types in return. Azumarill can clean teams with +6 Aqua Jet after Tapu Bulu has weakened opposing Pokemon. Klefki can set up Spikes and dual screens, provide further support with Thunder Wave, switch into Poison- and Steel-types attacks aimed at Tapu Bulu thanks to its Steel typing, and act as an emergency check to some sweepers with Foul Play. Klefki heavily appreciates Grassy Terrain support as well, which halves Earthquake damage and gives it passive recovery. Babiri Berry Togekiss and Clefable can check Steel-types and deal sizeable damage to Skarmory, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor, all of which wall Tapu Bulu. Togekiss also checks Mega Venusaur thanks to its Flying typing and Serene Grace Air Slash.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Wood Hammer is Tapu Bulu's strongest STAB attack and boosted by both Grassy Terrain and Choice Band, dealing massive damage to Pokemon that don't resist it at the cost of significant recoil damage. Horn Leech provides Tapu Bulu with a reliable means of recovery while still hitting hard under Grassy Terrain. Superpower hits Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, which would otherwise completely wall Tapu Bulu. Stone Edge hits Flying- and Fire-types such as Zapdos and Volcarona, which resist Tapu Bulu's Grass-type attacks. Zen Headbutt can be used instead of Stone Edge to let Tapu Bulu hit Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature and Choice Band maximizes Tapu Bulu's damage output, allowing it to bust holes in the opposing team. 252 Speed EVs make Tapu Bulu as fast as possible, outpacing neutral-natured Seismitoad, which would otherwise outspeed it and KO it with Sludge Wave. Grassy Surge summons Grassy Terrain upon switching in, boosting the power of Tapu Bulu's Grass-type moves, decreasing the power of Earthquake, and restoring health each turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu should be brought in early-game to weaken foes for its teammates as much as possible. It should use Wood Hammer as often as possible, as Wood Hammer deals the most damage under Grassy Terrain and weakens threats immensely. On the other hand, Horn Leech should be used when Tapu Bulu's HP is low and you want to preserve it, or if Horn Leech would still KO the foe to avoid taking unnecessary recoil damage. Tapu Bulu should attempt to advantage of Wood Hammer and Horn Leech while Grassy Terrain is active. Go for Superpower against Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, and go for Stone Edge or Zen Headbutt against Fire- and Flying-types or Poison-types, respectively. Aim to keep Grassy Terrain up as much as possible to provide passive healing for teammates and reduce Earthquake damage, especially against Ground teams. Tapu Bulu's typing helps it switch into some attacks for its teammates, such as Garchomp's Earthquake, Xurkitree's Thunderbolt, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet. However, be wary about switching it into Tapu Fini, as Grassy Terrain overriding Misty Surge allows Scald to potentially burn Tapu Bulu. Avoid getting Tapu Bulu worn down by entry hazards, since it needs its HP to tank hits before attacking. Similarly, avoid letting Tapu Bulu get burned, since burns halve Tapu Bulu's Attack stat, making it much less threatening. Lastly, Tapu Bulu's subpar Speed makes it vulnerable to a myriad of revenge killers, so it is best to remove faster threats before bringing Tapu Bulu in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Almost all Fairy-types appreciate Tapu Bulu's wallbreaking capabilities, ability to take on Ground-type teams, and Grassy Terrain support. Klefki's Steel typing allows it to switch into Poison-type moves for Tapu Bulu, and it can also provide support with dual screens, Thunder Wave, and Spikes, improving Tapu Bulu's longevity, speed control, and ability to KO threats. Klefki also appreciates Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake from threats like Excadrill and granting it passive recovery. Mega Diancie can also deal with some Poison-types, and Magic Bounce lets it beat down some defensive and support Pokemon. Tapu Koko can gain momentum for Tapu Bulu by letting it come in safely with Volt Switch or U-turn, and it easily checks Celesteela and Skarmory as well as revenge killers such as Landorus. Tapu Fini and Togekiss can provide Defog support for Tapu Bulu, keeping entry hazards off the field. Both of them can also stallbreak effectively with Taunt and Nasty Plot, respectively. The former can also weaken walls with Nature's Madness, whereas the latter can take on Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur. Choice Scarf Togekiss can also revenge kill targets that Tapu Bulu would struggle against, such as Infernape. Togekiss's Babiri Berry set can take hits from Mega Scizor and take it out with Fire Blast. Clefable is another Babiri Berry user that can take out Mega Scizor for Tapu Bulu, and it can even provide Stealth Rock support to pressure opposing teams. Z-Belly Drum Azumarill is able to threaten Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and appreciates Tapu Bulu's wallbreaking capabilities early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Lastly, Mega Gardevoir can check select Poison-types like Mega Venusaur thanks to its Psychic typing and is a powerful wallbreaker that can punch holes into opposing teams.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf (Grass)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Wood Hammer is insanely powerful under Grassy Terrain and is Tapu Bulu's strongest move and most reliable way to break past walls such as Mega Sableye, though it comes at the cost of being worn down due to recoil. Horn Leech, although weaker, provides Tapu Bulu with a way to recover its HP while still dealing considerably high damage. This is especially useful against weakened or frailer Pokemon that Horn Leech can KO, such as Diggersby, in order to preserve its longevity. Superpower offers useful coverage that can deal with certain Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn, which otherwise wall Tapu Bulu. Lastly, Stone Edge's main purpose is to offer coverage against Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types that resist Tapu Bulu's other coverage moves such as Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum EVs in Speed, a Jolly nature, and Choice Scarf allow Tapu Bulu to compensate for its unimpressive Speed stat and outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame. Maximum investment in Attack allows Tapu Bulu to hit as hard as possible. Grassy Surge grants Tapu Bulu and the entire team a boost to their Grass-type moves as well as passive recovery for all grounded Pokemon, enabling Tapu Bulu to become Grass's most threatening offensive option while offering a huge benefit to its teammates as well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is quite important to be selective when deciding whether to use Wood Hammer or Horn Leech during the game. Wood Hammer should be used early-game more often, as it's Tapu Bulu's main way of effectively revenge killing and punching holes in the opposing team, while Horn Leech can serve as a serviceable option against weakened teams late-game for it to clean. Additionally, while Wood Hammer's recoil can wear Tapu Bulu down quickly, it ensures that bulkier Pokemon like Chansey and Toxapex are 2HKOed. Tapu Bulu is best utilized as a great revenge killer, coming in on fast Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny that it can KO while simultaneously serving as a solid wallbreaker. It is imperative for Tapu Bulu to avoid all kinds of status, as a potential paralysis or burn can cripple its Speed or Attack stat. Tapu Bulu also dislikes being poisoned, as it becomes easily worn down in tandem with Wood Hammer recoil. When faced against common Choice Scarf revenge killers that can KO Tapu Bulu like Greninja and Nihilego, it is important to make use of its bulkier teammates in order to check these Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn. Tapu Bulu requires Grassy Terrain being up in order to KO certain common defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, so it is important to keep this in mind before attempting to break past these Pokemon. Do not use Superpower outside of hitting select Steel- and Normal-types, as it locks Tapu Bulu into a move that lowers its Attack and Defense and opens the door for many setup sweepers and walls such as Volcarona and Porygon2 to simply come in on it. Be wary of Protect users like Celesteela that can scout for Tapu Bulu's move, waste Grassy Terrain turns, and give teammates a potential switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The residual recovery offered by Tapu Bulu's Grassy Surge makes defensive Pokemon ideal partners for it. Mega Venusaur's fantastic defensive utility makes it a vital team option for Tapu Bulu. Mega Venusaur's great typing allows it to switch into physical attackers such as Mega Scizor, while Tapu Bulu can eliminate stronger wallbreakers such as Mega Diancie with ease. Ferrothorn helps Tapu Bulu by taking on many bulkier threats such as Skarmory and Porygon2. It also possesses an amazing defensive typing with a useful immunity to Poison, allowing it to check Poison-types such as Nihilego for Tapu Bulu. Ferrothorn can also provide entry hazard support in the form of Spikes to enhance Tapu Bulu's ability to wallbreak. Cradily completes a great defensive core between it, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur, checks certain Fire- and Flying-types such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y with Rock Slide, and provides Stealth Rock support for Tapu Bulu and the rest of the team. Cradily can also cripple problematic walls for Tapu Bulu such as Porygon2 with Toxic. Celebi is a good offensive partner for Tapu Bulu, mainly taking on threatening Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur while pressuring bulkier teams thanks to its access to Nasty Plot. On the other hand, Tapu Bulu shines more against offensively oriented types such as Psychic that Celebi may struggle with. Breloom is another offensive setup threat that pairs well with Tapu Bulu, offering strong priority and access to Spore to shut down problematic Pokemon such as Toxapex. Additionally, Tapu Bulu's Grassy Surge gives Breloom an easier time preserving its Focus Sash while making its Bullet Seed an even stronger STAB move.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Fini's solid bulk coupled with its amazing Water / Fairy typing allows it to switch into attacks it resists, such as Fire-, Ice-, and Water-type moves, while also granting it a neutrality to Steel, making it a nice check to threats such as Infernape, Alolan Sandslash, and Mega Scizor. Even though Misty Surge is not as good as other Terrain-setting abilities, it carves Tapu Fini a niche on Fairy teams, preventing itself and its teammates from being inflicted by any status aliments, which is very useful in keeping them from being worn down by burns or poison or crippled by paralysis. With Tapu Fini's bulk and defensive typing, these characteristics enable it to take on the role of a Defogger, as Fairy teams often lack an entry hazard remover and this allows Togekiss, the only other option, to run a more offensive set. With access to Taunt and Nature's Madness, Tapu Fini is able to function as an proficient stallbreaker for Fairy teams, taking on annoying bulky Pokemon such as Chansey. However, Tapu Fini lacks any reliable recovery, making it worn down faster from entry hazards and opposing Pokemon's attacks. Even though Misty Terrain prevents any status moves from taking effect, Tapu Fini can't burn grounded threats with Scald until the affects have passed, and with it's teammates such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu's abilities overriding Misty Terrain, they are still susceptible to status. Despite Tapu Fini's decent Special Attack stat, it's still not enough for it to deal massive damage to other teams. Thus, Tapu Fini has difficulty finding a spot on the team, being outclassed by Azumarill, another Water / Fairy, which has a great ability in Huge Power, can run Normalium Z + Belly Drum, and is a reliable sweeper.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Calm Mind with Moonblast and Surf can be utilized to make Tapu Fini a late-game sweeper that should be used once all of its checks and counters are gone. Unfortunately, it's overshadowed by its support set, and Fairy teams already have strong special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie. Hydro Pump can also be used instead of Surf on the Calm Mind set for more damage; however, the accuracy is somewhat shaky. Protect is an option to help scout threats for any moves that would threaten Tapu Fini. It should be used in conjunction with Leftovers to acquire more recovery. Icium Z + Mist fully restores Tapu Fini's health and can be used on the Calm Mind set to have another chance at sweeping or on the support set. Haze can also be used with Icium Z because they both have the same effect in fully restoring health while having the effect of removing stats; however, this prevents Azumarill from utilizing Z-Belly Drum, which would enable it to sweep teams. Knock Off is another option in providing utility to remove items from annoying threats such as Chansey and Porygon2.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur deserves a special mention due to resisting Tapu Fini's Scald and recovering back health with Giga Drain even after Tapu Fini uses Nature's Madness.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Tapu Fini has a lot of trouble against Poison-types, as they resist its Fairy-type attacks barring Nature's Madness and have no problem KOing it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Many Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Alolan Raichu, and Choice Scarf Xurkitree can easily outspeed Tapu Fini and KO it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Serperior, Celebi, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu are able to outspeed Tapu Fini and KO it with their STAB moves. Celebi can set up Nasty Plot, while Serperior can use Tapu Fini to gain boosts from Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Strong attackers such as Dragon Dance + Flyinium Z Gyarados, Nasty Plot Mew, and Swords Dance Mega Pinsir can all set up on Tapu Fini and easily break through it.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Taunt can shut down setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Scizor, can stop opposing walls such as Soft-Boiled Chansey and Leech Seed Celesteela from recovering health, and can neuter entry hazard setters such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Clefable. Nature's Madness halves the opposing Pokemon's health. When Nature's Madness is combined with Taunt, Tapu Fini becomes an effective stallbreaker, weakening and checking walls such as Toxapex. Tapu Fini needs another attacking move because Nature's Madness is only good to cut a threat's health in half, so Scald is chosen as a reliable STAB move that has a chance to burn the foe, especially Tapu Bulu, which tends to switch in and activate Grassy Terrain; however, Scald has bad synergy with Misty Terrain because grounded Pokemon aren't affected by status. Defog grants Fairy teams a reliable Defogger to give Tapu Fini's teammates more opportunities to switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Fini to be as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Calm Mind Suicune and defensive Jirachi. 252 HP EVs increase Tapu Fini's bulk in order to tank attacks more efficiently, especially if it needs to switch in to use Defog to remove entry hazards. Leftovers gives Tapu Fini passive recovery every turn. Misty Surge protects itself and its teammates from any status, allowing them to play much more aggressively on the field while setting up for a sweep and wallbreaking.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure not to switch in Tapu Fini carelessly on threats just because of its bulk investment. Instead, take advantage of its defensive typing to switch into resisted attacks. Due to its lack of recovery and reliance on Leftovers, make sure not to switch Tapu Fini in too often. Even though Tapu Fini resists Dark-type attacks, many foes would still go for a Knock Off to remove its or its teammate's item, so switch out so it doesn't lose out on the longevity Leftovers provides. In the event Tapu Fini isn't on the field mid-game while an entry hazard setter is, it's best to switch it in immediately, especially when Toxic Spikes are on the field, and clear the field with Defog. Remember, despite Misty Terrain protecting Tapu Fini from status, it will get poisoned from Toxic Spikes prior to its ability activating. Tapu Fini should mainly be used against defensive Pokemon that would pose a threat to its team, so using Taunt on them and going for Nature's Madness is always the best thing to do. If Tapu Fini is against bulky defensive threats such as Chansey and Celesteela, immediately go for Taunt to prevent them from setting up Stealth Rock and Leech Seed, respectively. Even though Nature's Madness should be used more towards defensive Pokemon, it's also reliable in wearing down more offensive threats that would try to switch into it. Scald is a great move, especially in case Tapu Fini's Misty Terrain has disappeared or Tapu Bulu tries to switch in and activate Grassy Terrain. While Misty Terrain is gone, Tapu Fini should always fire off Scald in order to get a burn to wear opposing Pokemon down faster.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Fini supports Fairy teams by weakening walls with Nature's Madness and clearing the field of entry hazards with Defog. Klefki can provide dual screen support to assist Tapu Fini in tanking any attack better while spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave prior to Tapu Fini switching in and Misty Terrain activating. Klefki can also set down Spikes to wear down the opposing team, while Tapu Fini can pressure them with Nature's Madness to wear down bulkier Pokemon even more. With its Steel typing, Klefki becomes a reliable switch-in to incoming Poison-type attacks for Tapu Fini. Clefable provides utility with Stealth Rock, and combined with Tapu Fini's stallbreaking capabilities, the two can severely weaken threats. With Magic Guard, Clefable becomes a great status absorber for Tapu Fini once Misty Terrain disappears. Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu appreciate Tapu Fini weakening walls, allowing them to KO opposing threats more easily. Tapu Bulu can also switch into resisted Electric- and Ground-type attacks for Tapu Fini, while Tapu Koko can bring in Tapu Fini with a Volt Switch or U-turn from a double switch. Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir are great wallbreakers that can finish off threats weakened by Tapu Fini's Nature's Madness. Mega Diancie can bounce back entry hazards to give Tapu Fini more opportunities to switch in. Sweepers such as Azumarill and Mimikyu enjoy being free of status while under Misty Terrain to set up Z-Belly Drum or Swords Dance and proceed to sweep; in Mimikyu's case, the opposing team would have to rely on breaking its Disguise or phazing it. With Tapu Fini running Defog, Togekiss can play more aggressive in running a Choice Scarf set. Togekiss also is a great switch-in to Grass- and Ground-type attacks thanks to its Flying typing.</p> "

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<h1>Poison</h1> <p>With an excellent defensive typing and two decent forms of recovery, Mega Venusaur is an amazing defensive stop to many offensive and defensive foes alike, ranging from Celesteela to Greninja to Tapu Koko. Thick Fat is a wonderful ability for Mega Venusaur, as it halves the damage taken from Fire- and Ice-type moves and makes it a better wall as a result. Mega Venusaur's secondary Grass typing is essential for Poison teams, as it can reliably check problematic Ground-types such as Dugtrio, Hippowdon, and Mega Swampert through Giga Drain. However, like many defensive tanks, Mega Venusaur is rather slow and susceptible to faster offensive threats in Dragonite and stallbreaker Hydreigon. Also, although Mega Venusaur is meant to tank many hits, it can be worn down by chip damage from entry hazards and moves upon switching in. This is because its main recovery in Synthesis only has 8 PP, while its other option in Leech Seed only heals a small amount of health each turn and has a chance to miss the foe.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is a staple of Grass teams because of its excellent typing, offenses, and movepool with superbly balanced stats. A Grass / Poison typing and Thick Fat grant Mega Venusaur valuable neutralities to Fire-, Ice-, Bug-, and Poison-type attacks. Between this defensive utility, Synthesis, and tremendous mixed defenses, Mega Venusaur serves as a formidable sponge for both physical and special attacks and a sturdy check for threats such as Nidoking and Mega Scizor. With great offensive stats, Mega Venusaur serves the defensive core without being passive enough to take advantage of. However, Mega Venusaur relies on Synthesis for reliable recovery, which has a mere 8 PP. Thus, Mega Venusaur is susceptible to being worn down by entry hazards and chip damage and cannot take repeated hits from potent wallbreakers such as Landorus and Mega Charizard Y. Furthermore, while Poison typing offers a valuable neutrality to Poison- and Bug-type moves, it also opens up a weakness to Psychic-type attacks and makes it difficult for Mega Venusaur to manage powerful Ground-type threats such as Diggersby and Excadrill.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Poison</h1> <p>Earthquake can be utilized over Hidden Power Fire to beat one of Mega Venusaur's biggest stops in Heatran. Outside of this purpose, however, there isn't much of a reason to use it, since Mega Venusaur would have to utilize its subpar Attack stat. Additionally, teammates such as Nidoking and Scolipede carry Ground-type coverage for Heatran and have greater power behind their attacks. Mega Venusaur can also run an EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 Spe allowing it to outspeed Jolly Azumarill, which oftentimes runs Return to take care of Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>The mixed defensive Mega Venusaur spread is flexible and can be fine-tuned to better manage specific threats for the team. A full specially defensive spread, 232 HP / 252 SpD / 20 Spe with a Calm nature, can also be run to specialize Mega Venusaur's bulk at the cost of broad effectiveness. A bulky offensive spread, 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe with a Modest nature, can be utilized to bolster Mega Venusaur's offensive presence. However, this spread has a much harder time managing multiple threats throughout a battle due to the lack of bulk investment. Earthquake is an option to help Mega Venusaur threaten Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Heatran, Nidoking, and Magnezone that it otherwise struggles to manage. Curse Mega Venusaur can act as a wincon against more passive teams, but it is unfortunately let down by Mega Venusaur's poor Attack and offensive coverage.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types overall threaten Mega Venusaur, as offensive foes like Mega Gallade and Latios threaten Mega Venusaur through their Psychic-type STAB attacks, while defensive foes such as Jirachi and stallbreaker Mew can status and gradually chip away at Mega Venusaur with few repercussions.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Flying-types: Offensive Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Tornadus-T threaten Mega Venusaur with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Naturally powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Dragonite, Diggersby, Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y can easily wear down Mega Venusaur, as its meager recovery means that it cannot take consecutive hits from these foes despite having very solid bulk all-around.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Common stallbreakers such as Mew, Heatran, Gliscor, and Crobat can prevent Mega Venusaur from recovering through Taunt, rendering its role as a tank useless for a short period of time.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Calm Mind Mega Latias, Z-Conversion Porygon-Z, and Supersonic Skystrike Gyarados are a few of the setup sweepers that can take advantage of and overpower Mega Venusaur after one boost, as its lackluster offensive coverage invites these foes in.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Mega Alakazam, Alolan Raichu, and Latios heavily threaten Mega Venusaur with STAB Psychic-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Despite Thick Fat, Fire-types such as Victini and Mega Charizard X put extreme pressure on Mega Venusaur with potent Fire-type STAB attacks, especially in sun. Heatran can be especially threatening if it gets a Flash Fire boost from Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Mega Pinsir, Togekiss, and Crobat threaten Mega Venusaur with their STAB Flying-type attacks. However, even without those, Flying-types such as Zapdos are bulky enough to stall Mega Venusaur out.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Mega Venusaur has limited recovery and is not bulky enough to tank repeated hits from potent wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Diggersby, and Landorus.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mega Venusaur is prone to being rendered setup bait due to its mediocre offensive coverage and must be careful so that sweepers such as Landorus-T, Mewnium Z Mew, and Volcarona don't take advantage of it to set up and sweep the team.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Mega Venusaur struggles with stallbreaking methods, including Taunt and Magma Storm, and can be easily shut down by stallbreakers such as Mew, Gliscor, and Heatran.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain allows Mega Venusaur to immediately restore health upon use and also hits Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Dugtrio. Sludge Bomb is primarily used to hit Grass- and Fairy-types such as Breloom and Tapu Koko for super effective damage, though its high chance to poison is also beneficial to chip away at other defensive tanks such as Mantine, Mega Sableye, and Porygon2. Synthesis is Mega Venusaur's main form of recovery. Hidden Power Fire hits bulky Steel-types in Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor for solid damage, effectively preventing further entry hazard stacking or setup. Leech Seed is another option that allows Mega Venusaur to gain passive recovery by sapping away at the foe's health and is very useful against its defensive checks such as Chansey and Celesteela.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>16 Speed EVs are used to Speed creep Adamant Azumarill. The remaining EVs are placed into HP and Defense and coupled with a Bold nature to maximize Mega Venusaur's physical bulk while also giving it a chance to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Victini's V-create. Venusaurite is the required item in order to use Mega Venusaur. Thick Fat is Mega Venusaur's only ability, halving damage from Fire- and Ice-type moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's ideal to Mega Evolve Venusaur immediately, as it gains the defensive capabilities of Thick Fat, which allows Mega Venusaur to take on many Fire- and Ice-type attacks. Use Sludge Bomb and Leech Seed whenever possible, as they both gradually chip away at the foe. Leech Seed has the additional benefit of giving weakened teammates extra health, so they can be brought in on defensive options from foes, such as their recovery moves. Though Mega Venusaur is very bulky, it's susceptible to being worn down from entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock, which is especially noteworthy considering the low PP of Synthesis. If possible, Defog hazards away before sending Mega Venusaur in. Mega Venusaur is Poison's best check against Ground teams and its best way to defeat them, so do not send it out carelessly against every incoming Ground-type attack. Mega Venusaur must take caution when using Synthesis in different weather conditions, as its recovery is reduced in hail, rain, and sandstorm. Against setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, it's ideal to switch to a teammate that can check them, such as Haze Toxapex or Choice Scarf Nihilego. Both of these teammates assist Mega Venusaur by preemptively stopping them and can force a switch as a result. Utilize Mega Venusaur to come in and block common Trick users like Gengar that look to swap items with teammates like Crobat and Toxapex, as it would inhibit their utility roles. Be cautious of Taunt users such as Aerodactyl and Hydreigon, as they will restrict Mega Venusaur's ability to recover its health. It is ideal to have Mega Venusaur as healthy as possible in order for it to tank hits.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex is a premier partner for Mega Venusaur, as its various forms of recovery and better resistance to Fire- and Ice-type moves ease the pressure on Mega Venusaur to handle Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Kyurem-B. Toxapex's ability to spread various forms of status through Scald burns, Toxic Spikes, and Baneful Bunker punishes physical attackers constantly. Baneful Bunker also allows Toxapex to scout options from common Choice-locked foes such as Tapu Koko and Latios and make the appropriate switch to a teammate. In return, Mega Venusaur offers an Electric resistance and a Ground neutrality for Toxapex. Alolan Muk also complements Mega Venusaur defensively, as its Dark typing and access to Knock Off and Pursuit make it a very potent presence against Psychic-types such as Latios and Dual Dance Mew that otherwise become very threatening to Poison teams. In return, Mega Venusaur can pivot into Ground-types and physical attackers for Alolan Muk. Choice Scarf Nihilego is a solid revenge killer against Flying- and Fire-types that threaten Mega Venusaur, such as Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona. Nidoking can support Mega Venusaur as an offensive Stealth Rock user and wallbreaker, as its sheer power and vast coverage options can 2HKO defensive walls such as Mega Sableye and Celesteela. In return, Mega Venusaur can come in on Water- and Ice-type attacks that threaten Nidoking. Crobat assists Mega Venusaur by providing a Ground immunity and acting as a utility teammate, with options such as Defog and Taunt to prevent hazard stacking and U-turn to pivot out to teammates. Crobat can also check Mega Pinsir, one of Mega Venusaur's biggest offensive checks, through Brave Bird and use Taunt to prevent hazard stacking and recovery from Ferrothorn and Chansey. Gengar acts as a check to problematic Psychic-types such as Mega Gallade and Victini while also being able to spinblock foes such as Torkoal and Armaldo, which is very important for taking on Fire and Bug teams, as these Pokemon are their primary form of hazard control. Scolipede acts a setup sweeper that can check common revenge killers such as Latios and Excadrill after a couple of Speed boosts as well as act as a potent cleaner against Psychic teams, since it can threaten common checks to it after multiple Speed boosts, such as Choice Scarf Victini, Choice Scarf Latios, and Mega Latias. SubToxic Salazzle is a niche teammate that uses its unique ability, Corrosion, to poison and stall out Poison- and Steel-types such as Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, Heatran, and Celesteela.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb is the main source of Mega Venusaur's offensive presence. Synthesis recovers health and is vital to keeping Mega Venusaur healthy throughout a match. Hidden Power Fire helps Mega Venusaur threaten Steel-type threats such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Giga Drain is a moderately strong Grass-type STAB attack that provides recovery on top of damage. It should be used liberally to heal off chip from tanking hits or switching in on entry hazards. Leech Seed is a good option over Giga Drain that offers a consistent source of recovery beside Synthesis for Mega Venusaur and the rest of Grass's defensive core while whittling down both offensive and defensive threats with chip damage, such as Heatran. Sleep Powder is an option for Mega Venusaur to check setup sweepers and disable both offensive and defensive threats to the team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs and 244 Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximize Mega Venusaur's physical bulk to make it as formidable a response as possible to threats such as Victini, avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Scarf V-create. 16 Speed EVs let Mega Venusaur outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Azumarill. Chlorophyll doubles Mega Venusaur's Speed in sun before Mega Evolving, which can have niche utility against threats such as Mega Charizard Y or Fire teams. An alternative mixed defensive spread featuring maximum HP EVs, 80 Special Defense EVs, and 160 Defense EVs with a Calm Nature can be used to allow Mega Venusaur to better manage special threats such as Nidoking and Greninja while still sporting enough physical bulk to handle Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Get Venusaur in safely to Mega Evolve as soon as possible to make immediate use of the improved bulk and Thick Fat. Make sure to preserve Mega Venusaur carefully in matchups where it is needed to check threats such as Mega Scizor. Sleep Powder, if used, should likewise be saved for dangerous threats to the team. Synthesis, while a source of reliable recovery, only has 8 PP and should only be used when absolutely necessary and not to stall out attacks, with the exception of V-create Victini. Likewise, let teammates manage threats whenever possible to preserve Mega Venusaur's limited recovery and minimize chip. However, Mega Venusaur can sponge Toxic and Toxic Spikes for the team and, since Mega Venusaur's Mega Stone cannot be removed, it is a good switch-in to Knock Off and Trick. Spam Giga Drain or Leech Seed liberally, as they provide sustained recovery to heal off chip damage without wasting Synthesis PP while whittling down the opposing team. Use Sludge Bomb to fish for the poison against Pokemon that wall Mega Venusaur, such as Zapdos and Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ferrothorn helps support Mega Venusaur with its excellent Grass / Steel typing, which provides an immunity to Poison-type attacks and neutralities to Flying-, Bug-, and Ice-type attacks. It can also stack Spikes to wear down the opponent's team and synergizes well with Mega Venusaur's capacity to force switches. Cradily is a great specially defensive wall and Grass's premier sponge for Fire-type moves and Stealth Rock setter. Cradily is capable of checking special attackers that are threats to Mega Venusaur such as Quiver Dance Volcarona. Tapu Bulu is an amazing teammate for Mega Venusaur that acts as an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf while setting Grassy Terrain, which boosts Mega Venusaur's STAB Giga Drain. Grassy Terrain's passive recovery and Earthquake debuff also helps support Mega Venusaur defensively. Breloom is a strong physical attacker and cleaner for Grass teams that offers priority with Technician-boosted Mach Punch and valuable Spore utility. Breloom appreciates having Mega Venusaur to fall back on and wear down its checks, and it can check threats to Mega Venusaur such as Heatran and Diggersby in return. Celebi is a strong special attacker that offers valuable Psychic-type STAB to manage Poison-type threats such as Nidoking and Toxapex that Mega Venusaur struggles with while providing a resistance to Psychic-type moves to cover Mega Venusaur's weakness. Celebi's coverage in Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire helps in the Steel matchup. Rotom-C is a solid pivot and revenge killer for Grass teams that can serve as a soft check for threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Pinsir when holding a Choice Scarf. Serperior is a fast special sweeper that can clean late-game with Contrary Leaf Storm and appreciates Mega Venusaur wearing down its checks. Gourgeist-XL is a decent teammate for Mega Venusaur that offers a secondary Bug- and Poison-type neutrality, a Fighting- and Normal-type immunity, Will-O-Wisp and spinblocking utility. Gourgeist-XL takes a lot of pressure off of Mega Venusaur to manage physical threats such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Mega Scizor. Whimsicott can support Mega Venusaur with speed control in Prankster Stun Spore and by disabling setup sweepers with Encore. Its Fairy-type STAB is particularly helpful against Dragon-types that threaten Mega Venusaur such as Dragonite, Kyurem-B, and Latios.</p> "

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fire</h1> <p>Charizard is blessed with two equally viable Mega Evolutions, which makes it an excellent choice for every Fire team. Mega Charizard X makes use of Dragon Dance along with a high Attack stat and Tough Claws to be a potent late-game sweeper, and respectable bulk along with reliable recovery in Roost gives it more opportunities to set up a Dragon Dance. Mega Charizard X's Dragon typing also gives it a handy neutrality to Water-type attacks and a helpful resistance to Electric-type attacks, granting it more opportunities to set up a Dragon Dance. However, Mega Charizard X lacks its other formes' immunity to Ground-type attacks, which leaves it susceptible to common Ground-type attacks from the likes of Mamoswine and Garchomp. It is easily stopped by status, with paralysis and poison specifically hindering its ability to effectively sweep. Charizard is also 4x weak to Stealth Rock before it Mega Evolves and extremely reliant on Flare Blitz to sweep, which means Mega Charizard X is easily worn down.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y is a superb wallbreaker, being able to KO bulky walls such as Zapdos and Hippowdon. It also has Drought, which weakens Water-type attacks and enables it to use Solar Beam without needing to charge. Its great coverage in Solar Beam and Focus Blast means it can get past some of its would-be checks and counters such as Swampert and Tyranitar, and access to Defog gives Fire teams a secondary form of entry hazard control. Mega Charizard Y's Flying typing makes it immune to Ground-type attacks, which gives it opportunities to wallbreak, and decent special bulk along with reliable recovery in Roost allows it to take most special attacks with ease. However, Mega Charizard Y is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, so Rapid Spin support from Torkoal is almost always necessary. It also doesn't have the best Defense stat, which means it is particularly susceptible to physical attackers such as Garchomp and Mega Sharpedo. Mega Charizard Y is extremely predictable because of its limited coverage options.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is an exceptional wallbreaker and is among the strongest wallbreakers available to Flying-type teams. Its ability, Drought, boosts Fire-type moves, allowing its Fire-type STAB attacks to OHKO or 2HKO almost every neutral target. Drought also has the bonus of halving the power of Water-type attacks and allowing Charizard to use Solar Beam, improving its matchup against Water- and Rock-types such as Azumarill, Manaphy, and Alolan Golem. Access to Focus Blast prevents Mega Charizard Y from being walled by Heatran and Tyranitar, some of the only would-be defensive counters available to their respective teams. Roost provides Charizard with longevity, allowing it to pressure the opposing team as a wallbreaker through both the early- and mid-game. Mega Charizard Y supports its team through an Ice neutrality and good special bulk, allowing it to be an offensive switch-in to special Ice-type attacks. For example, Mega Charizard Y can switch in on Life Orb Nidoking's Ice Beam and proceed to force it out. Unfortunately, Mega Charizard Y has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, taking 50% HP of damage upon entry. Defog support is necessary when using Mega Charizard Y, as Stealth Rock greatly limits Charizard's ability to switch in and removes its ability to sponge special Ice-type attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y can use Defog over Roost to remove entry hazards, but without Roost, it is extremely difficult to preserve Mega Charizard Y's health. Mega Charizard X can use an Adamant nature for added power, but it comes at the cost of being outsped by Kyurem-B and Excadrill.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Defog is a possibility over Roost on more offensive teams that choose to forgo using Skarmory or Mantine to Defog. A Modest nature can be used over Timid for additional power, helping Mega Charizard Y mediate the trade-off between power and accuracy. However, outspeeding Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Mimikyu as well as Speed tying with other base 100s is typically preferred. Mega Charizard Y can use Tailwind to break through offensive teams, though it has difficulty finding an opportunity to use the move safely against these team structures.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Certain defensive Pokemon wall Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. Special walls such as Chansey and Mantine can easily take multiple hits from Mega Charizard Y and recover off the damage. Physical walls such as Swampert and Hippowdon can take a hit from Mega Charizard X and can phaze it with Roar or Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex can easily take multiple hits from Mega Charizard X and Y while also having reliable recovery in Recover and Haze to negate Mega Charizard X's Dragon Dance boosts. However, it must be wary of its Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran can take one Focus Blast from Mega Charizard Y and can KO it with Stone Edge. Heatran also walls Mega Charizard X if it isn't carrying Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock takes half of Mega Charizard Y's health, hindering its ability to wallbreak, while taking a quarter of Mega Charizard X's health, making it difficult to sweep late-game.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Latios can outspeed and KO Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status cripples both Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. Paralysis halving Speed makes it extremely hard for Mega Charizard Y to effectively wallbreak while making it impossible for Mega Charizard X to sweep late-game. Poison slowly wears Mega Charizard X down, making successfully setting up a Dragon Dance difficult.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is perhaps the best defensive counter to Mega Charizard Y. It is able to easily take any attack, recover, and use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock to pressure Mega Charizard Y and its team.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Charizard and its Mega Evolution are both 4x weak to Stealth Rock, causing it to take 50% HP of damage upon switch in. This limits Mega Charizard Y's ability to effectively wallbreak and makes it more prone to being revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Mega Charizard Y has difficulty taking out most Dragon-types, as they resist its Fire-type STAB attacks and Solar Beam. Dragonite, Latios, and Latias additionally resist Focus Blast, making them excellent answers. Dragon-types above base 100 Speed, such as Garchomp, Latios, and Latias, can also revenge kill or otherwise easily force out Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: While Mega Charizard Y has a good Speed tier for a wallbreaker, it is still vulnerable to being revenge killed. The majority of offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko, Terrakion, Latios, and Nihilego, are above base 100 Speed and have the coverage and power to severely damage or OHKO Charizard.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters: Rain, sand, and hail halve the power of Solar Beam and cause it to take two turns to charge up. Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Pelipper prevent Charizard from spamming Solar Beam against their teams for fear of being trapped and KOed. Opposing weather also weakens Charizard's Fire-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Other Specially Defensive Pokemon: While Mega Charizard Y has the power to break through most walls, extremely specially defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine can take its attacks, recover, and retaliate.</p> </section>",

Flare Blitz is a powerful Fire-type attack that allows Mega Charizard X to hit Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, and Weavile at the cost of some of its HP. Outrage is a powerful Dragon-type attack that forces Mega Charizard X to use it for two or three turns without switching out. Dragon Claw is a weaker and safer option, but without Outrage, Mega Charizard X cannot break Toxapex. Roost can be used to increase Mega Charizard X's longevity, giving it more opportunities to sweep. Earthquake can be used to hit Heatran and Toxapex, but it comes at the cost of recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature ensures that Mega Charizard X is as fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and Choice Scarf Excadrill after a Dragon Dance. Maximum Attack investment ensures that Mega Charizard X hits as hard as possible. Blaze is preferred over Solar Power so that Charizard doesn't take any unnecessary damage under sun. Charizardite X allows Charizard to become Mega Charizard X, changing its ability to Tough Claws. Tough Claws slightly boosts the power of Mega Charizard X's contact moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If Charizard is going to be targeted by a Ground-type attack, it is usually best to not Mega Evolve so that it doesn't take unnecessary damage. Along with this, it is best to try to bluff Mega Charizard Y so that Mega Charizard X can take weak Water- and Electric-type attacks to easily set up a Dragon Dance. Avoid status ailments, specifically paralysis and poison, because they hinder Mega Charizard X's ability to sweep. Use Dragon Dance early-game to wallbreak or late-game to sweep. Use pivots such as Volt Switch Rotom-H and U-turn Victini to give Mega Charizard X more opportunities to set up a Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock should be removed before sending Mega Charizard X in so that it doesn't have to take unnecessary damage. Preserve Mega Charizard X's HP because it needs to be healthy to successfully set up a Dragon Dance. Be careful when locking Mega Charizard X into Outrage, as Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Togekiss can then utilize it as setup bait. Only use Flare Blitz when it is absolutely necessary, because the recoil damage can be devastating. Mega Charizard X should try to set up Dragon Dance once its checks and counters such as Roar Swampert, Unaware Quagsire, and Tyranitar are eliminated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. It can also set up sun with Drought, boosting Mega Charizard X's Fire-type attacks. Rotom-H can set up Light Screen and Reflect, making it much easier for Mega Charizard X to set up a Dragon Dance, while also acting as a decent pivot with Volt Switch. Volcarona can eliminate some of Mega Charizard X's checks such as Slowbro and Swampert, while Mega Charizard X can eliminate Chansey and Dragonite for Volcarona. Victini and Rotom-H can use U-turn and Volt Switch to bring Mega Charizard X in safely. Volcanion can eliminate Rock-and Fairy-types such as Tyranitar and Azumarill, while Mega Charizard X can eliminate Dragon-types such as Dragonite for Volcanion. Infernape can KO troublesome Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Nihilego for Mega Charizard X. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and eliminate Fairy- and Rock-types with its Steel-type attacks.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fire Blast is Mega Charizard Y's primary STAB attack and is boosted by Drought. Flamethrower is a more accurate option, but it cannot 2HKO Latios after Stealth Rock. Solar Beam allows Mega Charizard Y to hit Ground- and Water-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon. Focus Blast allows Mega Charizard Y to KO Heatran and Tyranitar, which would otherwise wall it. Roost is used to increase Mega Charizard Y's longevity.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature ensures that Mega Charizard Y is a fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Kyurem-B and Excadrill. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Mega Charizard Y to hit as hard as possible. Blaze is chosen over Solar Power so that Charizard doesn't take any unnecessary damage. Charizardite Y allows Charizard to become Mega Charizard Y, granting it Drought. Drought allows Mega Charizard Y to use Solar Beam in a single turn while halving the damage of Water-type attacks and boosting the power of Fire-type attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is usually best to remove entry hazards before sending Mega Charizard Y in so that it doesn't lose half of its HP. Use pivots such as U-turn Victini and Volt Switch Rotom-H to bring in Mega Charizard Y safely. Mega Charizard Y should aim to wallbreak early-game, while late-game it can sweep because of its respectable Speed stat. Be careful when using Solar Beam, especially against another weather summoner such as Tyranitar or Pelipper because using it in other weather traps Mega Charizard Y for two turns and halves the power of Solar Beam. Mega Charizard Y should avoid paralysis, as without its Speed stat, it is easily revenge killed by physical attackers such as Kyurem-B and Excadrill. Try to switch Mega Charizard Y in on a predicted double switch so that it doesn't have to take unnecessary damage. Preserve Mega Charizard Y's HP because it needs to be at full HP to take most powerful special attacks. Since Mega Charizard Y has a high Special Attack stat along with Drought, it is usually a great idea to spam Fire Blast. However, Fire Blast has low PP, so it is usually a better to use Solar Beam to KO a weakened target to preserve Fire Blast's PP. Mega Charizard Y should use Drought to easily switch in on weak Water-type attacks such as Scald Slowbro and Lanturn. Since Mega Charizard Y has a decent Special Defense stat, it can easily be switched in on weak special attacks such as Scald from Jellicent and Alomomola.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is a great choice for most Fire teams because of Drought boosting its teammates' Fire-type attacks while also reducing the damage taken from Water-type attacks. Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. It also can take powerful physical attacks for Mega Charizard Y. Victini can use U-turn to bring Mega Charizard Y in safely, while Mega Charizard Y can eliminate physical walls such as Swampert and Landorus-T. Rotom-H can use Volt Switch to bring Mega Charizard Y in safely and is a solid switch-in to Electric-type attacks. Volcanion can take Water-type attacks targeted at Mega Charizard Y and is a reliable check to Belly Drum Azumarill. Infernape can KO Heatran and Tyranitar so that Mega Charizard Y doesn't need to rely on the shaky accuracy of Focus Blast. Volcarona can eliminate bulky Psychic-types such as Mew and Latios for Mega Charizard Y with Bug Buzz. Alolan Marowak is an excellent switch-in to common Electric-type attacks that target Mega Charizard Y and is a superb physical wallbreaker.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fire Blast is Charizard's most powerful STAB attack. When boosted by Drought, it becomes extremely difficult to switch into and can 2HKO even Pokemon that resist it, such as Latios. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for its perfect accuracy; however, its lower Base Power means that Charizard will lose out on 2HKOs on bulkier Pokemon like Garchomp and Latios. Solar Beam allows Charizard to deal super effective damage to Water- and Rock-types like Azumarill, Manaphy, and Alolan Golem, which resist its Fire-type STAB attacks. Focus Blast is used to deal heavy damage to Tyranitar and Heatran, which otherwise wall this set. Roost allows Charizard to recover off Stealth Rock and chip damage. Roost also allows Charizard to use its good special bulk to reliably switch into special Ice-type attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Blaze is used as Charizard's pre-Mega ability rather than Solar Power to avoid taking damage from opposing sun. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Charizard's damage output, allowing it to effectively wallbreak. 252 Speed EVs are used with a Timid nature to allow Charizard to outspeed Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Mimikyu as well as Speed tie with opposing base 100s. Charizardite Y is required for Charizard to Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If possible, remove Stealth Rock before bringing in Mega Charizard Y to prevent it from being easily revenge killed. Use Mega Charizard Y to wallbreak in the early-game to open up opportunities for Charizard's teammates to sweep late-game. Be careful not to waste Fire Blast's PP, as it is very limited. Use Solar Beam to pick off weakened Pokemon for both PP preservation and perfect accuracy. Use U-turn or Volt Switch from teammates like Landorus-T and Zapdos to bring in Charizard safely, allowing it to pressure the opposing team. Double switches also work in allowing Charizard to apply pressure, though they have more inherent risk. Charizard can also be brought in directly against some special attacks, providing a switch-in to Nidoking's Ice Beam as well as some users of BoltBeam coverage, such as Porygon2. After switching into an attack, it's usually a good idea to use Roost to restore Charizard's longevity. The exception to this would be if getting damage on the opponent's defensive answer to Charizard could secure victory for a teammate—carefully evaluate these scenarios on a case-by-case basis. Mega Charizard Y is reliant on sun for wallbreaking; as such, choose moves carefully when facing opposing weather setters—if Mega Charizard Y uses Solar Beam as an opposing weather setter comes in, it will be unable to switch and can be KOed. Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Pelipper can remove sun and lock Charizard into a weakened two-turn Solar Beam, using the opportunity to strike Charizard with super effective moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory and Mantine are good supportive partners, able to reliably Defog entry hazards away. Skarmory also has a great matchup against sand teams, while Mantine beats most rain teams, assisting Charizard against opposing weather. Zapdos provides a neutrality to Electric-type attacks and can additionally support Charizard with Defog. Zapdos also offers an answer to some Pokemon that wall Mega Charizard Y, such as Mantine and Toxapex, and can use these Pokemon to set up a Substitute or throw off a Toxic. Alternatively, Zapdos can use a Volt Switch set to bring Mega Charizard Y in safely to wallbreak. Celesteela can handle most Dragon-types for Mega Charizard Y and also has the ability to wear down Chansey with Leech Seed. Togekiss provides additional support against Dragon-types and can cripple Chansey with Trick to assist Charizard. Choice Scarf Togekiss also helps Charizard's matchup against more offensively inclined teams and appreciates Charizard's wallbreaking in cleaning up late-game. Thundurus breaks through Toxapex and Mantine, supports Charizard with Thunder Wave, and can also lure Chansey with mixed sets. Landorus-T provides an immunity to Electric-type attacks, can set up Stealth Rock to weaken Mega Charizard Y's checks, and can also bring in Charizard safely via U-turn. Gliscor is another solid Stealth Rock setter that is additionally able to stallbreak using Taunt. Aerodactyl can be used on hyper offensive teams to set up Stealth Rock and provide support against opposing offensive teams thanks to its high Speed. Landorus makes a good partner, as it pairs with Charizard to apply heavy pressure to defensive teams and can additionally use Stealth Rock. Choice Band Dragonite breaks Mega Charizard Y's best defensive answers and can be difficult for foes to switch into. Dragonite can also use Extreme Speed to sweep weakened teams late-game. Gyarados is a solid Dragon Dance user, able to sweep weakened teams late-game. Salamence is another good Dragon Dance user that benefits from Z-Moves to begin a sweep with Moxie. Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking can allow Salamence to save its Z-Move to obliterate a check in the middle of a sweep rather than to begin one.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Mega Pidgeot is one of the best revenge killers on Normal, sporting unrivaled Speed and excellent Special Attack. It helps immensly in the Fighting matchup by outpacing and OHKOing threats such as Infernape and Keldeo while also greatly improving the Bug and Grass matchups, heavily pressuring defensive threats on Grass like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur with Heat Wave and Hurricane. Mega Pidgeot also pressures staples on Bug like Volcarona with its STAB Hurricane. Its ability, No Guard, offers great utility by boosting the accuracy of all its attacks, most notably Hurricane. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost, as it also makes sure foes' inaccurate attacks such as Hydro Pump, Focus Blast, and Stone Edge won't miss. Mega Pidgeot offers great team support through U-turn, boosting the team's momentum and bringing in powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Meloetta and Choice Band Diggersby as well as pivoting out to Porygon2, Chansey, and Staraptor, allowing them to take hits for Mega Pidgeot and recover. Mega Pidgeot also has access to utility such as Defog to relieve pressure off Staraptor, and it can utilize Tailwind to help wallbreakers smash holes through the even faster, offensive teams. Unfortunately, Mega Pidgeot has very poor defenses and is easily revenge killed by faster threats and priority once it has been weakened. It also has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its opportunities to switch in. Its movepool is also extremely limited, leaving it walled by Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Chansey, and Heatran. Mega Pidgeot also comes with the opportunity cost of not being able to use Mega Lopunny, which has perfect neutral STAB coverage as well as superior Speed that allows it to outpace metagame threats such as Greninja and Tapu Koko that Mega Pidgeot can't and helps out with tough matchups against types such as Dark and Steel.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Tailwind doubles the speed of powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Diggersby, turning them into devastating sweepers, but is useless against bulkier teams and limits Mega Pidgeot's coverage options. Substitute allows Mega Pidgeot to check a huge threat in Bisharp, mitigate prediction versus slower U-turn Pokemon, and prevent status. Substitute can also be utilized on free turns when your opponent sacrifices a slower Pokemon weak to Mega Pidgeot's coverage such as Ferrothorn or Keldeo. However, Substitute is niche and limits Mega Pidgeot's coverage.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran counters sets lacking Hidden Power Ground and is capable of KOing Mega Pidgeot with any Fire-type STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos resist Hurricane and force Mega Pidgeot out with their Electric-type STAB attacks. Other Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu can outpace Mega Pidgeot and threaten it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Priority from Pokemon such as Weavile and Bisharp can KO a weakened Mega Pidgeot.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types such as Tyranitar can survive multiple hits from Mega Pidgeot and either Pursuit trap it or KO it with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Mega Pidgeot can be outsped and OHKOed by Pokemon such as Greninja and Tapu Koko.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane is Mega Pidgeot's strongest STAB move and most spammable attack, only being resisted by Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types. Heat Wave is a secondary attack that nails defensive and offensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Bisharp, which threaten Normal teams. Roost gives Mega Pidgeot more longevity and allows it to stay in against defensive threats longer. U-turn allows Mega Pidgeot to pivot out of switch-ins such as Heatran and Tyranitar while also gaining momentum. Hidden Power Ground allows Mega Pidgeot to prevent opposing offensive Heatran from safely switching in but prevents it from using one of its more effective moves. Defog provides Normal with a secondary entry hazard remover, which is great for preventing chip damage on the team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to maximize Mega Pidgeot's attacking power. Maximum Speed and a Timid nature are used so Mega Pidgeot can outpace offensive threats such as Mega Gallade, Latios, and Keldeo. No Guard allows Mega Pidgeot to land inaccurate attacks such as Hurricane without fail. Pidgeotite is required for Pidgeot to evolve into Mega Pidgeot, as regular Pidgeot is not viable. Big Pecks is used to prevent foes from dropping Pidgeot's Defense before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Primarily use Mega Pidgeot as a revenge killer and cleaner, because it has very poor defenses. Therefore, only switch it in with a double switch, after one of its teammates has fainted, or through a slow U-turn. Use Roost whenever there is a possibility of a free turn to keep Mega Pidgeot healthy. Avoid switching into Stealth Rock unless necessary for an important double switch or sacrifice. Utilize U-turn on switch-ins such as Chansey, Heatran, Zapdos, and Tyranitar to allow strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Diggersby to come in and to scout the opposing team. Keep in mind that Mega Pidgeot can heavily threaten Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-type teams, so making double switches can seriously tilt the momentum in your favor. Avoid status, mainly poison and paralysis as the former can discourage double switches especially if rocks are up as in conjunction they wear down Mega Pidgeot very quickly and the latter prevents Pidgeot from revenge killing threats. Use Hurricane freely, as it is Mega Pidgeot's most reliable attack with No Guard, and even switch-ins have a chance of being confused. However, be wary, as No Guard also works against Mega Pidgeot, allowing foes to hit it with their own inaccurate attacks. If on the set, utilize Defog whenever Mega Pidgeot has a free turn to prevent teammates such as Porygon2, Chansey, and Staraptor from being chipped by entry hazards. For example, Mega Pidgeot can gain free turns from forcing foes such as Ferrothorn out and can capitalize on the free turn with Defog.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon like Diggersby synergize well with Mega Pidgeot because it can give them a free switch-in with U-turn. Choice Band Diggersby helps against Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-type teams, which Mega Pidgeot struggles against. Porygon2 can take physical hits from offensive threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu for Mega Pidgeot and chip defensive threats such as Celesteela into Mega Pidgeot's KO range with Discharge or Thunderbolt. It can also badly poison defensive threats and whittle them into range for Mega Pidgeot to KO later on and paralyze Choice Scarf users with Discharge or Thunder Wave so that Mega Pidgeot can outpace them. Similarly, Chansey can assist in wearing down the opposition with Toxic stall, Stealth Rock, and Seismic Toss for Mega Pidgeot to clean more easily. Thanks to its amazing Special Defense, you can bring it in on foes that threaten Mega Pidgeot like Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Nihilego. Finally, Chansey can freely switch into status moves with its ability Natural Cure, thus preventing Mega Pidgeot from being inflicted with status. Staraptor acts as a primary Defogger to keep Mega Pidgeot from taking Stealth Rock damage. It can also eliminate Pokemon that threaten Mega Pidgeot like Alolan Muk and bring Mega Pidgeot in freely by means of a slow U-turn. Ditto works as a secondary revenge killer to eliminate setup sweepers that outpace Mega Pidgeot. Pokemon such as Heliolisk can be utilized to form an effective VoltTurn core with Mega Pidgeot to gain momentum on more offensive teams. With Sticky Web support from Smeargle on offensive teams, Mega Pidgeot can outpace the majority of the boosted metagame. Stealth Rock also provides helpful chip damage so that Mega Pidgeot can get more KOs. Porygon-Z can help wear down the opposition with a Z-Conversion set's wallbreakering power to allow Mega Pidgeot to pick up KOs later in the game.</p> "

Alolan Raichu also has plethora of coverage moves such as Grass Knot, Surf, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power Ice, which allow it to get past some of its checks and counters such as Ferrothorn and Hippowdon. Alolan Raichu is able to become a potent sweeper when using Aloraichium Z along with Nasty Plot, although it lacks the immediate power and beneficial coverage of the Life Orb set. However, Alolan Raichu doesn't have the best bulk, which means it can easily be revenge killed outside of Electric Terrain. It also has a mediocre Special Attack stat, meaning it heavily relies on Electric Terrain to boost its Electric-type attacks.

Use Alolan Raichu to revenge kill fast threats such as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Victini. Alolan Raichu should also be used to clean late-game because of its high Speed stat and powerful Electric-type attacks in Electric Terrain. Avoid taking unnecessary damage because it lowers the number of hits Alolan Raichu can take from Life Orb.

Psychic is Alolan Raichu's other STAB attack, which is great for targeting Pokemon immune to Thunderbolt such as Landorus and Nidoking as well as troublesome Poison-types, most importantly Mega Venusaur. Nasty Plot turns Alolan Raichu into a threatening sweeper by enhancing its otherwise mediocre Special Attack. Focus Blast is important coverage for Raichu, ensuring it can hit Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn as well as letting it target troublesome Pokemon like Tyranitar and Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature ensures Alolan Raichu can hit as hard as possible while outspeeding the entire metagame with its ability, Surge Surfer, while under Electric Terrain. A Modest nature is necessary to ensure Alolan Raichu can OHKO Assault Vest Alolan Muk with boosted Stoked Sparksurfer while under Electric Terrain. Aloraichium Z enables Alolan Raichu to use Stoked Sparksurfer, a unique Z-Move that provides Alolan Raichu a one-time burst of damage to get past defensive Pokemon after prior chip damage that can otherwise wall it. Additionally, its 100% chance to paralyze can also come in handy against foes that it cannot OHKO.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a mid- to late-game sweeper, Alolan Raichu should be preserved as much as possible until it's able to finish off the opposing team. With that in mind, focus on chipping down Alolan Raichu's defensive checks like Chansey and eliminating its offensive checks like Bisharp to best put it into a position to sweep. Due to Alolan Raichu's low Special Attack, look for opportunities to freely use Nasty Plot. Some opportunities like this include against weak, defensive Pokemon like Toxapex that cannot do much to threaten it or on predicted switches. Additionally, due to its low Special Attack and middling Speed with Modest, be sure to maintain Electric Terrain at all times if possible to give it the boost it needs to sweep. Alolan Raichu is Electric's best tool to take on the troublesome Poison matchup. As such, play with it carefully and look for openings to bring in Alolan Raichu and freely use Nasty Plot so that it can effectively take down Alolan Muk with Stoked Sparksurfer and then sweep the remainder of the team with Psychic. Be sure to utilize Alolan Raichu's one-time Z-Move to overwhelm an opposing Pokemon that would otherwise survive one of its attacks. Even if Alolan Raichu doesn't have the chance to use its Z-Move to finish off a foe, it can be used for the 100% paralyze chance as a last-ditch effort to neutralize a threat to its team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is an essential partner for Alolan Raichu, as it requires Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain up in order to function at all as a sweeper. Tapu Koko also benefits Alolan Raichu by dealing with Dark- and Dragon-types that are threatening to Alolan Raichu like Hydreigon and Latios. Alolan Golem provides massive support in the form of Stealth Rock that helps chip down foes throughout the battle to enable Alolan Raichu to sweep late-game. Alolan Golem and Magnezone are able to trap and remove Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, removing the pressure from Alolan Raichu to take them down with Focus Blast. Zapdos and Rotom-W form an effective defensive pair for Electric that benefit Alolan Raichu by checking Ground-types, removing entry hazards, and acting as slow pivots to safely bring in Alolan Raichu throughout the battle. Zapdos notably can take on Tapu Bulu for Alolan Raichu, which is often a hard stop to it thanks to Grassy Surge overwriting the Electric Terrain Alolan Raichu requires to function. Zeraora is an effective physical attacker that can take on specially defensive Pokemon that Alolan Raichu is unable to deal with such as Chansey, and its high Speed helps other fast offensive foes that Alolan Raichu has trouble dealing with like Latios.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ice</h1> <p>With its ability Slush Rush, Alolan Sandslash is one of Ice teams' best options for keeping faster foes in check. Under hail, Alolan Sandslash is capable of outspeeding and threatening Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Landorus-T as well as +1 Mega Charizard X. Access to Rapid Spin along with its solid offensive presence also makes Alolan Sandslash an effective entry hazard remover due to forcing switches against Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Excadrill under hail. Its Steel typing grants it a neutrality to Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in more often when entry hazards are up, and an immunity to Toxic Spikes, improving its effectiveness as an entry hazard remover. Additionally, this secondary typing also grants it a neutrality to Steel-type moves, which, when paired with its decent Defense, allows it to take Steel-type attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Jirachi. However, Alolan Sandslash has terrible Speed outside of hail, leaving it very easily revenge killed, and a poor Attack stat makes it incapable of OHKOing Pokemon like Victini, Jirachi, and Kyurem-B without prior damage. It can't utilize an Adamant nature due to needing a Jolly nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon like Victini and Landorus-T under hail. Furthermore, its Steel typing grants it a 4x weakness to Fire- and Fighting-type moves, leaving it much more susceptible to Pokemon like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Keldeo. Even under hail, Alolan Sandslash is outsped and OHKOed by select Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Infernape, Terrakion, and Gengar. Alolan Sandslash also finds itself very easily walled by physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Venusaur without Swords Dance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ice</h1> <p>Rock Slide can be used in order to check Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona from full health without relying on Stealth Rock to guarantee a KO. However, Rapid Spin and Swords Dance are generally more useful moves. A Choice Band can be used as a means of always KOing Victini and Volcanion after Stealth Rock. However, Alolan Sandslash relies on being able to switch between its moves. Icium Z is an option for Swords Dance sets in order to break past defensive checks like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Sableye. However, in situations where it's unable to set up, Life Orb's general power increase is preferred.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ice</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Keldeo and Heracross can survive a hit from Alolan Sandslash and KO it with their STAB moves. Fighting-types with priority like Breloom can easily pick it off as well.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Torkoal and Air Balloon Heatran can take a hit from Alolan Sandslash and KO back with their STAB moves. Torkoal can even remove its hail thanks to Drought.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Celesteela don't care about Earthquake and can proceed to wear Alolan Sandslash down. Celesteela even has access to Flamethrower to quickly dispose of Alolan Sandslash.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Suicune, Rotom-W, and Mega Swampert don't take much damage from Alolan Sandslash's STAB moves and can wear it down easily with Scald or, in Mega Swampert's case, Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and Mega Slowbro aren't threatened by any of Alolan Sandslash's attacks and can slowly wear it down. Mega Sableye deserves a special mention due to being immune to Rapid Spin and being able to deter Alolan Sandslash from setting up with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast Choice Scarf Pokemon like Terrakion, Blacephalon, and Gengar can outspeed Alolan Sandslash under hail and threaten to KO it. Gengar and Blacephalon can even switch into a Rapid Spin if Alolan Sandslash attempts to remove entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Alolan Sandslash is very quickly worn down between hazard damage, Life Orb recoil, and status conditions like burn, making it rather difficult to preserve.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Icicle Crash is Alolan Sandslash's strongest STAB move, able to hit Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Iron Head is its strongest Steel-type STAB move and is used to hit Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Diancie. Earthquake is essential coverage in order to hit Fire- and Steel-types like Victini, Heatran, and Jirachi. Rapid Spin is used for removing entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, which is very important for Ice teams. Swords Dance is another option if the Ice team already has another hazard remover, bolstering Alolan Sandslash's effectiveness as a sweeper and allowing it to beat defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is used to make Alolan Sandslash as strong and fast as possible. A Jolly nature is important for outspeeding Choice Scarf Victini, Jirachi, and +1 Mega Charizard X under hail as well as Timid Magnezone and Adamant Bisharp outside of hail. A Life Orb is used to further increase Alolan Sandslash's damage output while also giving it the freedom of switching between its moves. The ability Slush Rush doubles Alolan Sandslash's Speed under hail, allowing it to serve as an effective sweeper and revenge killer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If Rapid Spin is used, try predicting when Pokemon such as Victini, Tapu Koko, and Excadrill will switch out in order to remove entry hazards for free. In a similar sense, if Swords Dance is used, try to predict your opponent to switch out in order to set up for free. This can allow Alolan Sandslash to break past defensive answers like Ferrothorn and Torkoal. Since Alolan Sandslash has awful special bulk, it's best to keep it away from special attacks, even resisted ones. In most situations, try setting up Swords Dance against passive Pokemon like Chansey and Cradily. However, if Aurora Veil is up, Alolan Sandslash can use the opportunity to set up against Pokemon like Armaldo and Latios. Make sure to keep Alolan Sandslash away from status conditions, since paralysis will nullify Slush Rush and burn will render it useless as a sweeper. Alolan Sandslash can find opportunities to sweep late-game once defensive checks such as Klefki and Rotom-W are removed on Fairy and Electric teams. Outside of hail, Alolan Sandslash is very slow and cannot be an effective sweeper, so in most instances, it's best to switch it out outside of hail.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales can check Fighting-types like Keldeo and Buzzwole for Alolan Sandslash, as well as set up Aurora Veil to allow Alolan Sandslash to switch in or set up with Swords Dance more easily. Kyurem-B can break through physical walls like Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, and Slowbro for Alolan Sandslash and offer a Fire neutrality. Weavile can trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mew and Gengar with Pursuit, as well as remove items with Knock Off to make Normal's Eviolite core easier for Alolan Sandslash to deal with. Mamoswine can put up Stealth Rock for Alolan Sandslash, allowing it to sweep more effectively. Mamoswine can also blanket check threats like Mega Lopunny, Mega Gallade, and Mega Scizor with Endeavor + Ice Shard, all of which can severely threaten Alolan Sandslash. Piloswine can switch into Fire-type attacks for Alolan Sandslash due to its ability Thick Fat, as well as set up Stealth Rock to let Alolan Sandslash sweep more easily. Avalugg and Rotom-F can fill the role of entry hazard removers, allowing Alolan Sandslash to freely run Swords Dance as its last move. Avalugg can also switch into Choice Scarf Pokemon like Infernape and Terrakion that outspeed Alolan Sandslash even in hail, while Rotom-F can switch into Ground-type moves and utilize Volt Switch to let Alolan Sandslash in safely. Lapras and Walrein are both capable of checking defensive Mega Scizor for Alolan Sandslash with Hidden Power Fire, and they offer a neutrality to Steel as well. Lapras can break past bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Swampert with Freeze-Dry, while Walrein offers a Fire resistance with Thick Fat in order to switch into Fire-type attacks from Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Infernape, both of which outspeed Alolan Sandslash in hail. Cloyster is a powerful setup sweeper that can sweep Fire teams for Alolan Sandslash. In return, Alolan Sandslash checks Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Magnezone and can clear entry hazards to keep Cloyster healthy as it sets up.</p> "

Nidoqueen also has more bulk than Nidoking, which allows it to survive attacks like of Mega Diancie's Earth Power and +2 Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. However, Nidoqueen's bulk comes with the price of having less Speed than Nidoking, which makes Heatran able to outpace it. Nidoqueen also has lower Special Attack than Nidoking, allowing Pokemon like Hippowdon and Zapdos to take its attacks. Nihilego also gives Nidoqueen competition as a Stealth Rock setter that can also free up a moveslot on Nidoking and outpace Pokemon Nidoqueen cannot like Landorus-T, Garchomp and Volcarona thanks to its higher Speed.</p> ",

Earth Power helps combats big threats to Poison like Excadrill, Mega Diancie, and Victini. Thunderbolt helps against Water- and Flying-types such as Slowbro and Mega Charizard Y and Defog users like Mantine. Ice Beam helps nail Dragon-, Flying-, and Ground-types like Hydreigon, Garchomp, Zapdos, Gliscor, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>164 HP EVs and Shuca Berry allow Nidoqueen to last as long as possible in the Steel- and the Ground-type matchup; it easily survives Earthquake from Excadrill and Landorus-T. 200 Speed EVs allow Nidoqueen to outpace Adamant Dragonite and Breloom and KO them with Ice Beam after it they have taken chip damage. 144 Special Attack EVs along with Sheer Force are used to make Nidoqueen's attacks powerful enough to KO Mega Scizor and Klefki. Alternatively, Nidoqueen can run Life Orb for an extra boost alongside Sheer Force in order to 2HKO Zapdos, Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Nidoqueen as a lead in key matchups like Dragon and Steel, as Ice Beam will threaten most Dragon-types into switching out, which is a perfect time to set Stealth Rock. Try to save Nidoqueen's Shuca Berry and enough HP to get a surprise KO on Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus-T. Be wary around faster and powerful Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Kyurem-B, and Latios, as they outpace Nidoqueen and can OHKO it from full health even with its decent bulk. Use Earth Power to weaken faster Taunt users like Tapu Koko and Cobalion, as most of the time they will use Taunt to cut off Nidoqueen from using Stealth Rock. Use Nidoqueen in Flying-type matchups to set Stealth Rock, as its coverage threatens common Defog users like Mantine, Gliscor, and Landorus-T as well as Thundurus-T and Celesteela.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nidoking appreciates Nidoqueen's Stealth Rock support to break through the opposition as a powerful wallbreaker that helps take care of troubling Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn, and because Nidoqueen runs Stealth Rock, Nidoking can run another move like Thunderbolt to pressure Flying- and Water-types like Mantine and Slowbro. Alolan Muk helps Nidoqueen by trapping troubling Psychic-types like Alolan Raichu and Latios and OHKOing them with Pursuit. Mega Venusaur is the main way of dealing with physical attackers like Azumarill and Mega Lopunny. Thanks to its ability Thick Fat, it can also take attacks from Mamoswine and Weavile. Mega Venusaur is also important to have on the team due to its Grass typing, which helps greatly in matchups like Ground and Water, making it a good switch-in to attacks like Earthquake from Excadrill and Landorus-T and Waterfall from Mega Swampert. It can also provide Leech Seed to give passive recovery to its teammates. In return, Nidoqueen can take care of troubling Fire-types like Infernape and Heatran. Crobat offers Defog support along with being able to threaten troubling Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade with Brave Bird. Furthermore, its Flying typing can help greatly with Ground-type attacks from the likes of Garchomp and Excadrill. Toxapex aids in taking care of Normal-types with its Toxic Spikes support being able to effectively cripple the bulky duo of Chansey and Porygon2. Thanks to its Water typing, Toxapex is able to switch in on Ice- and Water-type attacks from the likes of Weavile and Greninja. It can also help with Dragonite because of its amazing bulk and help with setup Pokemon like Mega Gallade and Mega Latias thanks to Haze. In return, Nidoqueen can switch into Electric-type attacks from Zapdos and Tapu Koko for Crobat and Toxapex.</p> "

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Nidoking's access to Sheer Force coupled with Life Orb makes it a great special wallbreaker. Its Poison typing helps tremendously against Grass and Fairy teams, notably enabling it to check Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur. Nidoking's wide movepool includes strong STAB moves in Earth Power and Sludge Wave and great coverage moves like Flamethrower and Ice Beam. Unfortunately, Nidoking's poor bulk means that it cannot switch in often and is easily revenge killed. While Nidoking can outspeed Pokemon like Xurkitree, Mega Altaria, and Mega Venusaur, it's still outsped by a vast majority of the metagame. It also faces competition from Landorus as a special wallbreaker due to its higher Speed, which lets it outspeed Mega Charizard Y, and Special Attack. However, using Nidoking instead of Landorus opens up the team to use Landorus-T, which is a powerful sweeper.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Nidoking is one of Poison's premier attacking options, sporting ridiculous coverage and power due to the combination of Sheer Force and Life Orb. It acts as a wallbreaker, especially in the matchup against Steel. Once Heatran's Air Balloon is gone, the combination of Earth Power and Flamethrower decimates Steel teams. Nidoking's access to BoltBeam coverage allows it to beat Flying on its own, although it usually forgoes Thunderbolt. Stealth Rock allows it to compress roles and be both a special attacker and entry hazard setter. Nidoking does have a few drawbacks, the first being that it has average defenses and as a result cannot take many hits; also, with the coverage it offers a team, it must be played carefully to preserve it. Nidoking's lackluster base 85 Speed makes it very susceptible to faster threats and therefore easily revenge killed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p>Toxic Spikes is a viable option on more offensive teams; however, it forces Nidoking to forgo one of its important coverage moves. Thunderbolt can be run exclusively to hit Mantine and Gyarados; however, the coverage provided by Ice Beam and Flamethrower is greater. Substitute lets Nidoking act as an even bigger threat to Grass and Fairy teams, but it means losing out on one of Nidoking's important moves.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Focus Blast allows Nidoking to hit Ice-, Rock-, and Normal-types for super effective damage and to do a great deal of damage to Heatran before its Air Balloon is popped. This is a poor choice, however, as it would replace Ice Beam to further improve performance against Steel at the expense of Nidoking's performance in the Flying and Dragon matchup.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey completely walls Nidoking and can KO it with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mantine, Araquanid, and Mew can easily switch into Nidoking. Mantine and Araquanid can KO it with a Water-type move, and Mew can use Knock Off to remove Life Orb, making Nidoking weaker. Mantine, however, needs to watch out for Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Pokemon like Terrakion, Victini, and Mega Charizard Y can easily take out Nidoking. Priority users like Azumarill, Dragonite, and Bisharp can revenge kill Nidoking with Aqua Jet, Extreme Speed, and Sucker Punch, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Offensive Water-types like Keldeo, Greninja, and Manaphy can KO Nidoking with their Water-type STAB moves.

Mamoswine can survive any attack from Nidoking and KO it back.

Since Nidoking is not a threat to it, Chansey can set up Stealth Rock for its team and wear down Nidoking with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls have access to reliable recovery and are able to easily wall Nidoking's coverage. The aforementioned Chansey and Mantine are two prime examples.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Excadrill in sand, Landorus, and Garchomp are all threats that can OHKO Nidoking and need to be played around by utilizing a Ground immunity and a partner such as Choice Scarf Nihilego with Hidden Power Ice or other super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Strong Ice-types with even middling Speed, such as Kyurem-B, can OHKO Nidoking without even needing a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Fast-hitting Psychic-types such as Victini force out Nidoking, as it is slower and will be OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Threats such as Sharpedo and Keldeo easily outspeed Nidoking and OHKO it with their Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Teams with faster threats such as Keldeo or Mega Charizard Y will easily be able to force Nidoking out or OHKO it due to its frailty and low Speed.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Wallbreaker (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sludge Wave is Nidoking's strongest STAB move and lets it hit Grass- and Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Mega Altaria. Earth Power is a secondary STAB move that lets Nidoking hit Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types like Heatran, Xurkitree, and Tyranitar. Ice Beam lets Nidoking hit Ground-, Dragon-, and Flying-types, like Gliscor, Garchomp, Zapdos, and Dragonite, as well as Cradily. Flamethrower completes Nidoking's coverage by allowing it to hit Pokemon like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Fire Blast is an alternate option that allows Nidoking to 2HKO Celesteela at the cost of lower accuracy and PP.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature is used in order to let Nidoking hit as hard and as fast as possible, notably being able to outspeed and KO Tapu Bulu and Xurkitree. Sheer Force coupled with Life Orb boosts the damage of Nidoking's attacks considerably without it having to take recoil damage from Life Orb.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Nidoking in as often as possible early-game in order to wallbreak. Due to its bad bulk, bring it in safely through a U-turn or after a fallen teammate. However, Nidoking can switch into weaker Pokemon like Clefable and Toxic-using Pokemon like Zapdos thanks to its Poison typing. Keep it healthy in Grass and Fairy matchups to check Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu. Especially in Steel matchups, make sure to keep Nidoking healthy to avoid letting it get picked off by priority from the likes of Mega Scizor. Against bulkier teams, Nidoking should generally play safer by choosing moves without overt prediction. As it's easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon, Nidoking should try to choose the appropriate coverage move to hit Pokemon that can switch into its other moves, such as Landorus-T and Latios, against more offensive teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Nidoking's ability to check Grass-types and wallbreak is appreciated by all of its teammates. Nidoking pairs fantastically with Landorus-T; Nidoking can wallbreak and remove or weaken checks to Double Dance Landorus-T like Skarmory and Hippowdon, both of which can phaze Landorus-T, while in return, Landorus-T can set up Swords Dance and break through checks to Nidoking like Rotom-W and Chansey. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can bring Nidoking in safely through U-turn. Hippowdon can sponge many attacks from Pokemon that threaten Nidoking such as Excadrill and Victini. Hippowdon also allows Nidoking to safely switch in thanks to Eject Button, and it can set Stealth Rock to wear the opposing team down and make it easier for Nidoking to wallbreak. Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Seismitoad can switch into Water-type moves. They can additionally switch into Ice-type attacks thanks to their Water typing. Seismitoad, in particular, can check Belly Drum Azumarill. In return, Nidoking can check Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Cradily. Gliscor is a great stallbreaker that can beat walls that Nidoking cannot such as Chansey and Porygon2. Physical wallbreakers like Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Excadrill can weaken Nidoking's checks such as Chansey and Mantine. Conversely, Nidoking can deal with physically defensive walls like Skarmory. Dugtrio can trap and remove checks to Nidoking like Kyurem-B, Mega Gardevoir, and Chansey. Nidoking can beat Flying-types like Skarmory and Zapdos that aren't trapped by Arena Trap in return. Choice Scarf Krookodile is an option on more offensive teams to Pursuit trap checks to Nidoking like Latios and Mega Alakazam. While most Ground teams generally don't have the space to run two special wallbreakers, Landorus and Nidoking can make good partners, as both of them can weaken their shared checks.</p> "

        "name": "Wallbreaker (Poison)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to support the rest of its team with entry hazard damage when it is in a matchup where it cannot deal much immediate damage but is also not threatened in return. Earth Power provides a Ground-type STAB move to the team, which is invaluable in Poison's Electric and Steel matchups and pairs well with Ice Beam and Flamethrower against those two types. Ice Beam is the strongest Ice-type coverage move that Poison has access to, as the only other option for coverage on other Pokemon is Hidden Power Ice. This is a vital move because it offers Poison a strong option for hitting Flying- and Dragon-types like Dragonite, for which the type has few solid answers. Flamethrower rounds out the set to OHKO threats like Scizor and walls such as Ferrothorn and Forretress if hazards have broken Sturdy. The combination of Flamethrower and Earth Power allows Nidoking to dominate Steel-type teams. Thunderbolt is an option to break Flying-types, particularly Mantine and Gyarados, if another Pokemon is using Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sheer Force is an incredible ability that increases Nidoking's damage output and removes Life Orb's recoil on all of its common moves. Base 85 Speed is relatively low for the metagame, so a Timid nature and maximum Speed investment are preferred to make Nidoking as fast a Stealth Rock setter as possible and ensure that it outspeeds Heatran. Maximum Special Attack investment is to get as much damage output as possible, as Nidoking is frail regardless of defensive investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a lead, Nidoking should set up Stealth Rock against a slower, more passive lead like Shuckle or look to damage the other team's lead if Nidoking can take a hit; if it cannot, you should likely switch to a partner, as Nidoking is a vital wallbreaker that Poison needs to win. It needs to be healthy enough to take a hit from something in order to 2HKO back. Avoid switching in Nidoking when it is not safe, as it has rather average defenses and provides invaluable coverage that helps against Steel, Electric, Flying, and Bug. Nidoking's different combinations of coverage allow it to easily tear through defensive cores on different teams depending on what coverage you run. A prime example is how BoltBeam easily dismantles Flying. Stealth Rock should be used against a slower offensive foe  that Nidoking easily threatens out or against a wall that poses no threat, such as Skarmory or Chansey. Whenever a Thunder Wave or Electric-type attack is obvious, for example from Klefki, switch in Nidoking to prevent anything on your team from losing Speed due to paralysis or from taking damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Muk is immune to Psychic-type attacks and can switch in on them and trap the foe with Pursuit or retaliate with Knock Off. One particular threat Alolan Muk can trap is Alolan Raichu, which threatens to OHKO Nidoking even without the Speed boost from Electric Terrain. Crobat has a Ground immunity and has the added benefit of being able to offensively pressure threats like Keldeo due to its high Speed and Flying-type STAB moves. It is also able to garner momentum for its team with U-turn, allowing you to either pivot to a wall on an anticipated super effective attack or bring in a threat on the switch. Gengar is another wallbreaker that beats bulkier Psychic-types like Mew with STAB Shadow Ball and is able to outspeed and KO faster Psychic-types that Nidoking cannot outspeed. Mega Venusaur is a great partner for Nidoking, as it has no problem handling Water-types like Azumarill and Keldeo that make quick work of Nidoking, can wear down bulkier walls on opposing teams with Leech Seed, and can handle Ground-types that threaten Nidoking with STAB Giga Drain. Nihilego's Rock-type STAB moves are able to decimate Ice- and Flying-types such as Kyurem-B and Mega Charizard Y that could revenge kill Nidoking. Nihilego can also take on Stealth Rock setting, which allows Nidoking to run a fourth coverage move. Scolipede is a sweeper capable of handling faster threats such as Mega Charizard Y that outspeed Nidoking. It is also great in the Psychic matchup due to its combination of STAB Megahorn and its ability Speed Boost, allowing it to outpace common Choice Scarf users after it gains a boost once. Toxapex switches into Water- and Ice-type attacks with ease and can set up Toxic Spikes to wear down some of Nidoking's checks such as Mew. Nidoking in turn brings an Electric immunity that Toxapex appreciates. Nidoqueen is run as a Stealth Rock setter on Poison teams and can be partnered with Nidoking to free up a moveslot.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Clefable stands out as one of the best defensive pivots on Fairy teams thanks to its great overall bulk in conjunction with an solid mono-Fairy defensive typing, letting it act as a versatile threat that can compress many roles in one slot. It also has access to an amazing ability in Magic Guard, which allows Clefable to be immune to all indirect damage, helping it act as a great entry hazard setter or defensive setup sweeper. Clefable also has an expansive movepool, consisting of useful utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Soft-Boiled alongside great coverage moves like Flamethrower, making it a formidable threat. It notably behaves as one of the best Mega Scizor checks, a threat that can otherwise wreak havoc on the rest of Clefable's team, when holding a Babiri Berry. Nonetheless, Clefable's bulk prevents it from sustaining hits from powerful wallbreakers such as Landorus, Victini, and Diggersby. Its typing also does not provide any other useful resistances for its teammates, meaning that Poison- and Steel-type threats such as Nidoking and Heatran can still pose a threat against it.</p> ",

It is also forced to run Moonlight, a low-PP and situational recovery move that can leave Clefable rather vulnerable at times.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Nidoking, Mega Venusaur, and Nihilego can all severely cripple Clefable with their STAB Poison-type attacks, and they resist Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Threats such as Excadrill, Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Celesteela all resist Clefable's STAB Fairy-type attacks and can threaten to break through it with their own STAB attacks in return.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock aids Clefable's teammates by weakening opposing threats through entry hazard chip damage. It is a valuable Stealth Rock setter due to its Fairy typing and Magic Guard ability scaring off common entry hazard removers and Magic Bounce users such as Mandibuzz, Latios, Armaldo, and Mega Sableye. Soft-Boiled is a reliable recovery move that increases Clefable's durability, making it more dependable as a defensive wall. Moonblast is Clefable's STAB move, allowing it to hit Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types extremely hard and preventing it from being used as setup bait. It also has the added factor of having the chance of lowering the foe's Special Attack, helping Clefable wall special attackers much better. Fire Blast is used to target Steel-type threats such as Mega Scizor and Bisharp. Flamethrower can be used instead, as its perfect accuracy offers more consistency instead of greater power.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Magic Guard allows Clefable to bypass any indirect damage, meaning that it can avoid being crippled by status conditions such as burn and poison. It also allows Clefable to come in more freely, since it can ignore the chip damage from entry hazards, meaning that it can escape the 2HKO from certain offensive threats such as Latios, Keldeo, and Terrakion. A Babiri Berry is equipped in order to lure certain Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill by avoiding the OHKO or 2HKO from their STAB Steel-type attacks while Clefable can hit them hard with its Fire-type coverage in return. Leftovers can be used instead to enhance Clefable's sustainability, letting it check a wide array of threats more safely due to the passive recovery each turn. The EVs have been maximized in HP and Defense with a Bold nature in order to enhance Clefable's physical bulk, allowing it to check threats such as Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Mega Gyarados. However, a fully specially defensive spread with a Calm nature can be used instead in order for Clefable to act as a specially defensive tank that can check attackers like Meloetta, Volcanion, and Thundurus more reliably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefable should be setting up Stealth Rock early on in the match, since the chip damage helps its teammates break down walls much better. It can set up Stealth Rock frequently due to it high number of opportunities to switch in. Thanks to its ability, Clefable can be used as a sponge to status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, meaning that it can pivot in against common users of such moves like Zapdos and Mew. However, Clefable must be wary of coming in against powerful attackers such as Landorus and Choice Band Victini. It should also avoid staying in versus certain wallbreakers that can 2HKO it such as Tapu Koko and Meloetta unless they have been severely weakened, since Clefable can use up all of its Soft-Boiled PP rather quickly, preventing it from sustaining itself later on in the match. Clefable should also be careful when conserving its Babiri Berry, since it can be necessary to check certain threats such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill. Therefore, avoiding Steel-type coverage from threats such as Celesteela and Magnezone is imperative.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that can utilize the entry hazard support that Clefable provides is key, meaning that threats such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Gardevoir all stand out as great picks. Tapu Koko also acts as a great pivot that can aid Clefable in coming in safely, while Tapu Bulu offers additional passive recovery through Grassy Terrain, which can be useful if it decides to not run Leftovers. Mega Diancie appreciates Clefable using Stealth Rock, allowing it to use Psychic or another coverage move instead. Klefki is beneficial, since it can help Clefable check Poison- and other Steel-types much better, while Clefable can switch into Fighting-types in return. Klefki can also provide more entry hazard and screens support with Spikes, Reflect, and Light Screen. Setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Swords Dance Tapu Bulu can also be useful for wearing down opposing walls that can be difficult for Clefable to wear down like Mantine and Mew, while Clefable provides them with entry hazard support in return. Entry hazard removal through partners such as Togekiss and Tapu Fini can also be beneficial, since, although it does not get affected by them, Clefable's susceptibility to being used as entry hazard setup fodder can still necessitate it being placed on the team.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind transforms Clefable into a bulky yet powerful sweeper that can easily wreak havoc after a couple of boosts. Moonblast is Clefable's STAB move, which offers great offensive coverage and provides the chance to lower the enemy's Special Attack, making Clefable even more difficult to take down. Flamethrower is a remarkable coverage option that helps Clefable breaks through Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Excadrill, and Celesteela. Soft-Boiled is an important recovery move that permits Clefable the chance to set up more frequently by increasing its sustainability overall. Thunder Wave is an alternative utility move that allows Clefable to cripple offensive threats such as Heatran, Mega Pidgeot, and Keldeo by reducing their Speed. It also can grant Clefable more setup opportunities if the opposing foe is afflicted with paralysis. However, it means that Clefable must pass up a coverage option, leaving it more susceptible versus certain threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Magic Guard allows Clefable to ignore any indirect damage such as poison and burn, making it much more difficult to circumvent after it sets up a couple of boosts. Leftovers is the preferred item, since the passive recovery each turn aids Clefable in avoiding the 2HKO from certain offensive threats such as Thundurus and Garchomp. The EVs have been fully invested in HP and Defense with a Bold nature in order to maximize Clefable's physical bulk, making it almost impossible to OHKO after a few Calm Mind boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefable is best used as a late-game cleaner, since it can have a much easier time sweeping once its checks such as Nidoking and Toxapex have been severely weakened or KOed. Clefable should avoid setting up alongside other Calm Mind sweepers such as Mega Slowbro and Meloetta, since the aforementioned threats often carry Psyshock, which can threaten to OHKO Clefable regardless of the number of Calm Mind boosts it was able to accumulate. Physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Victini and offensive Landorus-T can still threaten to 2HKO Clefable no matter how much it had invested in its physical bulk. Therefore, it is advised to pivot out against these threats in order to avoid Clefable being severely weakened. Clefable should also not be brought into the battlefield unnecessarily against stronger attacks, since it can risk getting weakened immensely, possibly preventing a sweep later on in the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Klefki is a great partner for Clefable, since it can switch into Poison-type attacks and provide useful support through Reflect, Light Screen, and Spikes, letting Clefable sponge more attacks, set up more easily, and break through walls. Stealth Rock Mega Diancie is a must, as it provides the support that Clefable normally does. Other setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Tapu Bulu are also beneficial, since they can help apply more offensive pressure against the opposing team and help Clefable break through special walls such as Chansey and Alolan Muk. Wallbreakers like Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu benefit from Clefable's ability to break through defensive walls and can help check offensive threats in return. Tapu Koko can also provide momentum through Volt Switch, enabling Clefable to come in more frequently. Entry hazard removal from teammates such as Togekiss and Tapu Fini can also be useful because it remedies Clefable's susceptibility of being used as an entry hazard setup fodder.</p> "

Its Speed tier puts it just above threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo, which is extremely important for Ice teams. Its part-Fairy typing allows it to check threats such as Mega Sableye, Buzzwole, and Keldeo. Thanks to Snow Warning, it is the most important partner for Pokemon with Slush Rush such as Alolan Sandslash and Beartic. Access to Encore lets it cripple entry hazard setters like Forretress and Torkoal as well as setup sweepers like Volcarona and Bisharp. However, its mediocre Special Attack leaves it unable to offensively pressure Pokemon that it can't hit super effectively, such as Clefable and Mew. With an Ice / Fairy typing, it is burdened with weaknesses to common attacking types like Fire and Poison as well as a 4x Steel weakness. It is also weak to Stealth Rock, making it very easy to wear down. Furthermore, a limited offensive movepool outside of its STAB moves leaves it consistently walled by common Fire- and Steel-types like Torkoal, Heatran, and Celesteela.

Freeze-Dry is the Ice-type STAB move of choice due to its ability to hit Water-types such as Swampert, Mantine, and Pelipper super effectively. Moonblast is the strongest Fairy-type STAB move Alolan Ninetales has access to and is able to hit Dark- and Fighting-types such as Mega Sableye, Buzzwole, and Keldeo hard. Encore is used to cripple entry hazard setters like Forretress and Torkoal as well as setup sweepers like Bisharp and Volcarona. Blizzard can be used as a more powerful Ice-type STAB move that has perfect accuracy in hail and can OHKO Mega Pinsir and 2HKO Skarmory. Hidden Power Fire is another alternative to keep Mega Scizor from setting up for free while also targeting Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Alolan Ninetales to be as strong and as fast as possible. A Timid nature allows it to outspeed Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Pinsir. Snow Warning is vital in order to set up Aurora Veil and give Slush Rush Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash and Beartic doubled Speed. Light Clay is the item used to increase the duration of Aurora Veil to eight turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try switching in with Alolan Ninetales frequently to set up Aurora Veil to increase its teammates' survivability. Keep entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes off the field as much as you can, since they wear down Alolan Ninetales quickly and limit the number of times it can switch in. With its high Speed stat, Alolan Ninetales ends up losing many lead matchups against opposing weather setters like Torkoal and Tyranitar, which can result in an inability to set up Aurora Veil and a huge loss of momentum. As such, it's best not to lead with Alolan Ninetales immediately in these situations. However, it would be a great idea to lead with Alolan Ninetales otherwise in order to get up Aurora Veil as soon as possible. If you're running Encore, try switching into a Rapid Spin or Defog from entry hazard removers such as Forretress and Mandibuzz or a setup move from Bisharp or Clefable in order to cripple them and give yourself a free opportunity to set up Aurora Veil. It is also beneficial to switch in when the foe tries to set up Stealth Rock in order to cripple them with Encore without taking any hazard damage. Keep Alolan Ninetales away from status as much as possible, as paralysis can halve its Speed and poison will slowly wear it down each turn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Everything on Ice appreciates the extra survivability Alolan Ninetales provides with Aurora Veil, as well as its ability to check Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Keldeo. Avalugg is a great partner that can remove entry hazards for Alolan Ninetales with Rapid Spin as well as switch into threatening physical attackers like Jirachi, Excadrill, and Alolan Muk. In return, Alolan Ninetales can offensively check special attackers that threaten Avalugg, such as Landorus and Hydreigon. Piloswine and Mamoswine can both set up Stealth Rock for Alolan Ninetales while also taking neutral damage from Rock- and Fire-type attacks thanks to their typing and Thick Fat and resisting Poison-type attacks. Piloswine is able to phaze setup Pokemon with priority like Mega Scizor and Azumarill as well as switch into threatening special attackers like Heatran and Nihilego. Mamoswine on the other hand is able to offensively check weather setters like Torkoal and Tyranitar, as well as Steel- and Poison-types like Heatran, Magnezone, and Alolan Muk. In return, Alolan Ninetales can deal with bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Swampert. Kyurem-B can break through special walls like Empoleon, Celesteela, and Heatran, and Alolan Ninetales can remove Water-types that are immune to Fusion Bolt like Swampert and Seismitoad as well as switch into Dragon-type attacks. Lapras and Walrein can switch into Fire- and Steel-type attacks for Alolan Ninetales. They also serve as checks towards Fire- and Steel-types like Heatran, Alolan Marowak, Ferrothorn, and especially Mega Scizor, which is the most potent counter to Alolan Ninetales. Weavile can Pursuit trap Ghost- and Psychic-types that threaten to KO Alolan Ninetales such as Gengar, Victini, and Jirachi while removing items with Knock Off and dealing with special walls. Alolan Ninetales in return deals with physically defensive Water-types like Swampert and Toxapex. Cloyster appreciates Alolan Ninetales's Aurora Veil, as it gives Cloyster an easier time setting up with Shell Smash. Cloyster can take on Fire-, Steel-, and Rock-types that threaten Alolan Ninetales such as Victini, Excadrill, and Nihilego after setting up. Alolan Sandslash and Beartic greatly benefit from Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning ability, doubling their Speed and allowing them to effectively sweep. They also break through special walls that give Alolan Ninetales a hard time. Alolan Sandslash offers entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, as well as Rock and Steel neutralities and a Poison immunity. Beartic is capable of breaking through special walls like Chansey and Ferrothorn as well as outspeeding and revenge killing Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona in hail with Stone Edge.</p> "

  "Dugtrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio's ability Arena Trap is the main reason to use it in the first place, as it prevents grounded Pokemon from switching out, letting Dugtrio act as the most effective and reliable revenge killer for Ground teams. With a Focus Sash in conjunction with Arena Trap, Dugtrio can guarantee the removal of dangerous grounded threats like Choice Scarf Greninja locked into Ice Beam (or variants not carrying U-turn) and Excadrill. Dugtrio's reliability in disposing of specific threats for Ground teams is one of its greatest assets. In addition to sporting a fantastic ability, Dugtrio has a nice, uncrowded Speed tier that lets it outspeed troublesome grounded foes like Choice Specs Keldeo. Having access to Sucker Punch, Dugtrio can check faster and weakened threats in addition to some Psychic- and Ghost-types, the latter of which cannot be trapped, while preserving its Focus Sash. Furthermore, despite its atrocious Special Attack, Dugtrio actually becomes one the best checks to Tapu Bulu, Ground's greatest threat, with Sludge Wave. With Gravity support, Dugtrio can even trap and eliminate numerous airborne threats like Mega Charizard Y, Celesteela, and Zapdos. While Dugtrio's horrible defensive stats let it activate its Focus Sash and boost Reversal's Base Power to 200 more easily, they also make it really vulnerable to opposing revenge killers and let it easily fall prey to weaker moves and priority attacks. Dugtrio needs considerable team support in order to properly function; due to its frailty, it needs a safe way to enter the field, be it with a double switch, after a teammate's U-turn, or after a teammate has been KOed. Dugtrio also needs entry hazard control to keep its Focus Sash intact, or else it won't be able to properly fulfill its purpose of trapping and removing opposing threats. Without the help of Gravity, Dugtrio becomes near-useless against airborne threats, as it cannot seriously harm them with any of its moves. Finally, even though Dugtrio's Attack stat isn't that bad, it's not that great either, so opposing Pokemon need more often than not to be weakened before Dugtrio can properly revenge kill them. It's also too weak to seriously threaten most walls.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Memento can replace Sucker Punch to instead halve an opposing Pokemon's damage output and bring a setup sweeper like Swords Dance Excadrill, Garchomp, or Mega Garchomp or a wallbreaker like Mamoswine on the field so they get a free turn to boost their stats or punch a hole in the opposing team, respectively. However, not using Sucker Punch on Dugtrio means losing out on checking faster and weakened threats, greatly diminishing Dugtrio's overall trapping utility and potential. Toxic can be used to cripple walls like Slowbro, Porygon2, and Hippowdon, but again, that means Dugtrio won't be able to trap and check faster threats, which Ground teams really appreciate from it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Walls: Dugtrio isn't powerful enough to blast through walls, being completely walled by most physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory (even with Gravity support) and Mega Venusaur and even some specially defensive ones like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Dugtrio needs Gravity support to actually threaten most Flying-types by trapping and eliminating them for its teammates. However, without Gravity support, Flying-types force Dugtrio out, as they're naturally immune to Earthquake, and even the frailest ones, such as Mega Charizard Y, take minimal damage from its other moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Dugtrio cannot trap Ghost-types, so it's often best to switch out against them to avoid either being walled by Mega Sableye or Jellicent or losing momentum against opposing Pokemon switching out fearing Sucker Punch, like Choice Scarf Gengar and Blacephalon.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Most Bug-types force Dugtrio out, since they either resist Dugtrio's moves, outspeed it, or outright wall it. For example, Mega Pinsir is immune to Earthquake, has a 4x resistance to Reversal, and has decent physical bulk that lets it take minimal damage from Dugtrio's Sucker Punch, meaning it can freely set up Swords Dances against Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to Dugtrio's horrendous bulk, opposing revenge killers like Choice Scarf Keldeo and Mega Lopunny and priority users like Azumarill and Breloom can easily dispose of Dugtrio once its Focus Sash is broken.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Revenge Killer",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Dugtrio's strongest and only recommended STAB move and its best option against most opposing Pokemon. When Dugtrio is at 1 to 8 HP, Reversal becomes a powerful 200-Base Power attack that can deal significant damage to Pokemon such as Chansey and Kyurem-B. Sucker Punch allows Dugtrio to revenge kill faster threats like Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain and weakened foes without breaking its Focus Sash, letting it trap a wide array of Pokemon during the course of the match. Sludge Wave takes the last moveslot specifically to check Tapu Bulu, as it's one of the greatest threats to Ground teams. While Dugtrio can't actually OHKO Tapu Bulu, it will almost always be in range of being KOed after some chip damage, which can be easily attained from Wood Hammer's recoil.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is needed for Dugtrio to be as strong and fast as possible. A Naive nature is chosen over a Hasty one, as it lets Dugtrio have less bulk overall, meaning it will activate its Focus Sash and boost Reversal's Base Power more easily. Focus Sash is the item of choice, as it lets Dugtrio survive a single attack from full health and even revenge kill faster Pokemon. Arena Trap should be the only ability used by Dugtrio, as it lets Dugtrio trap and remove dangerous threats for Ground teams like Choice Specs Keldeo. The suggested IVs serve specific purposes: 21 HP IVs let Dugtrio have 201 HP, which is the minimal amount to survive two Seismic Tosses from Chansey, and 0 Defense and Special Defense IVs guarantee an OHKO against Ditto in addition to making Dugtrio as frail as possible both physically and specially.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid directly switching Dugtrio into attacks as much as possible and clear any entry hazards away before switching in, as it relies on its Focus Sash to trap and revenge kill most threats. Double switches, a teammate's U-turn, and going on the field after one of Dugtrio's teammates has been KOed all are effective ways to safely bring it on the field. Without Gravity support, Dugtrio should not try to face off against Flying-types, as they can't be trapped or seriously harmed by any of its moves, meaning that against Flying teams, Dugtrio should not come on the field unless Gravity is active. Dangerous threats like Choice Specs Keldeo should be trapped by Dugtrio early-game before they severely dent the Ground team beyond repair. Dugtrio is unable to trap Ghost-types, so it will have a hard time revenge killing them. Additionally, since most of them fear Sucker Punch, they will switch out to one of their teammates that wall Dugtrio. Therefore, the best option most of the time is for Dugtrio to switch out as well to keep the momentum of the game. Against faster threats that don't care about Sucker Punch, it's advised to preserve Dugtrio's Focus Sash in order to properly dispose of them. In some of those cases, such as against Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, it might be needed to use Reversal right away, just before an incoming attack that will activate Dugtrio's Focus Sash, to KO the opposing Pokemon. Even though Dugtrio is most vulnerable to priority attacks, it can try and revenge kill opposing priority users like Mimikyu with its own priority Sucker Punch to keep its Focus Sash intact while doing so, but beware of its deceptively low damage output against neutral and even some super effective targets.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus brings crucial Gravity support for Dugtrio so it can trap and remove airborne threats on Flying and Steel teams like Mega Charizard Y and Celesteela. Landorus can also defeat Skarmory for Dugtrio after it has set up its Gravity. In return, Dugtrio can remove special walls like Chansey for Landorus. Additionally, Choice Scarf users that wouldn't normally outspeed Landorus like Tapu Bulu and Kyurem-B can be dealt with via Dugtrio's Sludge Wave and Reversal, respectively. In order to keep Dugtrio's Focus Sash intact so it can trap as many Pokemon as possible, entry hazard control from Rapid Spin Excadrill is really appreciated, if not mandatory. In return, Dugtrio can take out Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y (the latter with Gravity support) with Earthquake for Sand Rush Excadrill. For Dugtrio to achieve certain KOs, such as against Zapdos (with Gravity support) and Galvantula, it needs a teammate to set up Stealth Rock. Hippowdon is the best Stealth Rock setter Ground teams have to offer and is a great switch-in to most priority moves, which Dugtrio is very vulnerable to. As a bonus, Hippowdon can even forgo its Leftovers to use an Eject Button so that Dugtrio can safely enter the field after the former has been hit by an attacking move. One of Gastrodon and Seismitoad can be Dugtrio's teammate to switch into Water-type moves, with the former having the better overall bulk and longevity and the latter having better offensive stats, access to Knock Off, and the ability to check Azumarill, a dangerous threat to Ground teams. Garchomp or its Mega counterpart can be used as a setup sweeper or mixed wallbreaker to blast through physical walls like Skarmory and Mega Venusaur and other Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn that are neutral to Ground-type moves, while Dugtrio traps and KOes troublesome Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and non-U-turn Tapu Koko for it. Mamoswine can wallbreak against Grass and Flying teams for Dugtrio and brings another priority move for Ground teams, which is always appreciated. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is one of the few Ground-type Pokemon to learn U-turn and can put it to good use to safely bring Dugtrio onto the field.</p> "

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Alakazam can effectively check sweepers and other setup Pokemon, especially physical attackers such as Bisharp and Mega Sharpedo, that could otherwise run through Psychic teams uninhibited. Counter Alakazam works exceedingly well on hyper offensive teams as a guaranteed check to setup sweepers thanks to Magic Guard protecting it from indirect damage and preserving its Focus Sash. With its diverse movepool, Alakazam is capable of hitting the entire metagame without being walled by common typings, ensuring that it can put out consistent damage. However, because of its Psychic typing and low physical bulk, Alakazam is haunted by Pokemon capable of Pursuit trapping it such as Alolan Muk, Scizor, and Tyranitar. Alakazam completely depends on preserving its Focus Sash to be effective in matches most of the time; otherwise, it most likely won't be able to use Counter and loses one of its most important roles in checking physical sweepers. Counter Alakazam is also incredibly limited in its damage output, as it has no damage-boosting item or ability and only has a single STAB type.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Alakazam can also be used over the Counter + Focus Sash set as a fast, late-game sweeper, but Psychic has much better Mega options available to it, and Alakazam's main role as a check to physical sweepers is much better for Psychic teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Attacks: Because Alakazam has rather poor physical bulk, priority moves like Bullet Punch, Extreme Speed, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch are extremely dangerous and can take it out of matches instantly. Pokemon like Mega Scizor, Dragonite, Doublade, Mimikyu, and Bisharp are the most common of these priority users that can take out Alakazam if it is not at full health.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trapping: Thanks to its single typing of Psychic paired with poor physical bulk, Alakazam is the textbook example of Pursuit bait. The only way to approach this issue is to avoid sending in Alakazam until the Pursuit trappers are either eliminated or put into KO range for either form to take them out. Alakazam can be used as bait to get Pursuit trappers to switch in, but only when it is absolutely safe to do so.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Having switch-ins for physical threats ready to go is the only assured way to handle them. Although Alakazam is meant to check physical threats with Counter, this role disappears if it is not at full HP or Focus Sash is broken.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive Celesteela, Chansey, and Zapdos can prove to be a real pain to deal with for Alakazam because barring Special Defense drops and hazards, it cannot 2HKO any of these Pokemon. The only way to deal with these is by dealing chip damage as they switch in and going into an appropriate teammate designated to breaking special walls.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Focus Sash Alakazam can run into some trouble against Ghost teams, as its main purpose of utilizing a practically free Counter is rendered useless. Although it can put out super effective damage with Shadow Ball, the Ghost defensive core of Mega Sableye and Jellicent doesn't mind taking a hit or two while also forcing Alakazam out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Some major threats to Psychic teams that can safely outspeed and beat Alakazam include Pokemon such as Greninja and Tapu Koko.</p> ",

        "name": "Counter + Focus Sash",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Counter gives Psychic teams a guaranteed check to physical sweepers such as Bisharp, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Mega Sharpedo as well as countless others. It is also the best way to effectively check any physical threat the opposing team has and can do more damage and be more reliable than Alakazam's other moves. Psychic is Alakazam's main STAB move, maximizing its standard damage output. Focus Blast provides Alakazam with an option for hitting Pokemon that either resist or are immune to Psychic, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball allows Alakazam to hit Ghost-types such as Mimikyu super effectively and makes Alakazam into a potent threat against other Psychic teams thanks to Psychic having only one viable Ghost-type check in Meloetta. Dazzling Gleam can replace Focus Blast on teams that don't need help against Steel. Instead, Dazzling Gleam can 2HKO almost every Dragon-type and makes Dark almost struggle to get around Alakazam. Hidden Power Fire could be used over Shadow Ball as a way to manage both Bug- and Steel-type threats more reliably, such as Scizor; however, Hidden Power Fire should only be used with Focus Blast, as otherwise Heatran would wall Alakazam, preventing it from applying significant pressure to Steel teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in Alakazam's Special Attack enables it to hit opposing Pokemon as hard as possible. Maximum investment in Speed with a Hasty nature lets Alakazam make use of its great Speed tier, outpacing Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Gengar, and Thundurus as well as base 60 Choice Scarf users such as Magnezone. 0 IVs in Defense and a Hasty nature allow Alakazam to take as much physical damage as possible in order to make Counter even more powerful. Focus Sash lets Alakazam check physical sweepers that are major threats to Psychic teams like Scolipede and Choice Scarf Heracross. It also works in tandem with Counter to provide a guaranteed check to a multitude of physical threats such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Scizor. Magic Guard prevents Alakazam from taking damage from entry hazards, status, and weather, which is key to preserving Focus Sash and ultimately preventing Alakazam from losing its role of a general check to sweepers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Alakazam sparingly, as its overall damage output is fairly limited due to its single typing and lack of an offensive ability and item. In matchups where your team faces immense offensive pressure, preserve Alakazam for checking the most pressing threats, especially physical threats such as Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Mega Sharpedo, as Counter will most likely be able to OHKO them. If Alakazam is needed for using Counter in a match, be sure to prevent Focus Sash from being broken, or else Alakazam will be rendered useless and its ability to check sweepers and setup Pokemon will go to waste. Thanks to its Focus Sash, this Alakazam set can take on the role of a revenge killer, coming in after a teammate faints or through the use of U-turn. If there is a possibility that the opposing team could Pursuit trap Alakazam, avoid switching in Alakazam unless absolutely necessary. In the case that Alakazam does happen to be caught by a Pursuit trapper such as Alolan Muk and is at full health, simply use Counter and Alakazam will either OHKO the opposing threat or do enough damage that the opposing Pokemon will be able to be KOed by one of Alakazam's other moves. Do not directly switch Alakazam into any opposing Pokemon unless they do not carry attacking moves. Focus Sash Alakazam needs appropriate team support to get onto the field safely, such as with defensive pivot Jirachi or by punishing a switch with U-turn Victini. If worse comes to worst, preserving a weakened Pokemon with the intention of allowing a free switch for Alakazam is a viable strategy. Be careful when facing Pokemon that may run Substitute such as Mega Gyarados and Buzzwole. These threats should be attacked with Focus Blast and Psychic, respectively, in order to avoid missing out on an OHKO by using Counter on their Substitute. Due to Alakazam's many options, it can be advantageous to hide your moveset to force your opponent to play safe for fear of super effective coverage, such as in the matchup against Steel. Avoid confrontations with any specially defensive Pokemon such as Araquanid, Chansey, Gliscor, and Zapdos, as they can easily break Alakazam's Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini is an amazing teammate for Alakazam, as it has astounding physical wallbreaking potential thanks to V-create and Bolt Strike and can manage teams that Alakazam often struggles with such as Bug and Steel. Choice Scarf Victini also puts immense pressure on opposing teams and can force switches that it can take advantage of with U-turn to bring Alakazam in for free. Mega Gallade is one of Psychic's best options for a Mega Evolution, especially on offensive teams, as it's able to break down a plethora of defensive cores such as Normal's and Poison's, which Alakazam and the rest of the Psychic team heavily appreciates. Celebi is a solid option to quickly take control of matchups such as Fairy and Water due to these types generally running into issues with managing offensive Grass-types. Deoxys-S is an integral part of offensive Psychic teams, as it acts as the team's suicide lead, running either Stealth Rock and dual screens or hazard stack with Spikes. Choice Scarf Latias is a pretty decent option for keeping faster foes in check thanks to having similar stats to Latios but with the great option of running Healing Wish to potentially full heal Alakazam in a pinch if it has been chipped down and its Focus Sash has yet to be broken. Mega Latias is a solid Mega option for more balanced builds, as it can set up with Calm Mind and put immense pressure on opposing teams as well as potentially sweeping. Jirachi provides incredible utility support through setting Stealth Rock, spreading status, and returning Alakazam's health back to full with Healing Wish. It also has a slow U-turn that can get Alakazam onto the field without the risk of taking damage, ultimately keeping its Focus Sash intact. Slowbro and Mega Slowbro are both great physically defensive Pokemon that are the backbone of the Psychic defensive core and can mitigate damage that Alakazam would greatly prefer not to take. Both also serve as checks to physical attackers in their own right in case Alakazam's Focus Sash has been expended to manage a threat already. Mew's dynamic roles of stallbreaker and setup sweeper can give Alakazam solid support in their own rights. Stallbreaker Mew can cripple opposing threats with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, which can take off some of the pressure in needing to preserve Alakazam as a check to sweepers. Meloetta serves as Psychic's only switch-in to Ghost-type Pokemon; Alakazam can safely switch to Meloetta against Ghost-types, such as Blacephalon, Jellicent, and Mimikyu, that it would otherwise struggle with. Meloetta can also serve as a special wallbreaker, alleviating some of the pressure to use Alakazam in more risky situations just for its special damage. Latios in an excellent special wallbreaker that pairs fairly well with Alakazam. Latios is able to spam Draco Meteor and has coverage for Pokemon that Alakazam may struggle with on its own such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. It can also use Defog, which would support the team in general more so than Alakazam.</p> "

  "Golem-Alola": {
    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Alolan Golem is the best Stealth Rock user Electric-type teams have to offer because it can opt to use a trapper set centered around Magnet Pull and Air Balloon to greatly help in the Ground, Grass, and Steel matchups, where it can reliably KO Excadrill and Ferrothorn, two of Electric's greatest threats. Specifically, trapping and removing Excadrill lets Alolan Raichu wreak havoc on the opposing team. Additionally, by compressing the roles of Stealth Rock setter and trapper onto Alolan Golem, Electric opens up an extra teamslot for Pokemon like Zeraora and Thundurus. It also has a decent Attack stat and good coverage moves in Earthquake and Fire Punch to take advantage of its ability to trap Steel-types. It also has a great Defense stat, which allows it to take most physical attacks with ease. However, Alolan Golem is extremely slow, leaving it susceptible to revenge killers such as Latios and Tapu Bulu. Against teams lacking a Steel-type to trap, Magnet Pull Alolan Golem often finds itself only setting up Stealth Rock at best. That said, most teams do carry a Steel-type to help with the prevalence of Fairy, so Alolan Golem usually has the opportunity to trap something at some point. Its typing leaves it 4x weak to Ground-type attacks and vulnerable to common Water-, Fighting-, and Grass-type attacks. Due to its rather shallow movepool, Alolan Golem is also extremely predictable.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Alolan Golem fills an important role on Rock teams due to its ability Magnet Pull allowing it to trap and remove Steel-types. Additionally, its Electric typing grants it a neutrality to Steel-type attacks, which combines with its solid Defense stat to allow it to take attacks like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and Excadrill's Iron Head. With coverage options such as Fire Punch and Earthquake, Alolan Golem is able to beat Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Stakataka. However, Alolan Golem's poor Speed stat forces it to rely on Shuckle's Sticky Web to outspeed most offensive Steel-types and leaves it extremely vulnerable to revenge killers. Its awful Special Defense is also incredibly exploitable for common special attackers like Mega Diancie and Latios. These traits leave it with limited use outside of trapping Steel-types. It faces competition as a Mega Scizor check from Rhyperior, which has Solid Rock and the impeccable defensive stats and coverage necessary to check various physical threats like Landorus-T and Mega Lopunny. However, while Rhyperior can force Mega Scizor out as a check, only Alolan Golem can assuredly trap and KO it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 56 SpD / 204 Spe with a Careful nature can be used to offer Electric teams a secondary switch-in to special moves, letting Alolan Golem set up Stealth Rock multiple times throughout the game while retaining some offensive presence with Galvanize. Unfortunately, this Alolan Golem variant doesn't provide anything that's really valuable for Electric, as it is OHKOed by any Ground-type move and unable to seriously harm or pressure any notable Steel-types, and despite its defensive investments, it can only afford to switch into resisted special moves and some weaker neutral moves, making this set outclassed in almost every way.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Brick Break can be used as a means of preventing Klefki from setting up Light Screen and Reflect. However, Brick Break is best utilized on non-Choice Band sets, which are unable to OHKO Celesteela and defensive Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock. These sets typically run Expert Belt or Firium Z.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Garchomp can switch in on Alolan Golem and OHKO with their Ground-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Alolan Golem doesn't have much coverage, so Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu take multiple hits from Alolan Golem and KO it with their Grass-type attacks. However, Grass-types need to wary of Life Orb Alolan Golem with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physical walls such as Porygon2, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T can take multiple hits from Alolan Golem.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Pokemon such as Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Latios can switch in on Alolan Golem and threaten it with their powerful Dragon-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Stallbreakers such as Gliscor and Mew can prevent Stealth Rock with Taunt and either KO or burn Alolan Golem.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Chip damage, most notably from burn and hazards, cripples Alolan Golem. Burn halves Alolan Golem's Attack stat, while Stealth Rock breaks its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Landorus, Greninja, and Hydreigon deal massive damage to Alolan Golem because of its poor Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Because it lacks Electric-type attacks, Alolan Golem easily falls prey to most Water-types such as Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Revenge killers such as Tapu Bulu, Latios, and Landorus-T can outspeed and KO Alolan Golem.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Landorus can very easily switch into Alolan Golem and OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Breloom are able to OHKO Alolan Golem with their STAB moves despite not being able to come in on a Fire Punch.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is useful in problematic matchups, namely Dragon, and since Alolan Golem is the best Stealth Rock setter on Electric, this move is mandatory on such a set. It also lets Alolan Golem be useful outside of trapping threats. Earthquake allows Alolan Golem to OHKO Excadrill most of the time, a potent threat that can outspeed and OHKO many Electric-type Pokemon. Fire Punch serves as Alolan Golem's secondary coverage move and deals great damage to another common threat to Electric in Ferrothorn. Stone Edge is the preferred STAB move, as it allows Alolan Golem to hit common threats like Volcarona and Kyurem-B while also pressuring or KOing opposing Defoggers and spinners, such as Latios and Armaldo, that try to get rid of its Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Magnet Pull is what makes this set work, as it allows Alolan Golem to trap threatening Steel-types, namely Excadrill and Ferrothorn. Air Balloon, along with Magnet Pull, enables Alolan Golem to beat all Excadrill variants as long as it doesn't flinch from Iron Head. It also provides the Electric team with a Ground immunity. Maximum investment in Attack and Speed coupled with an Adamant nature makes Alolan Golem as strong as possible and lets it OHKO Excadrill while outspeeding uninvested Mantine, Klefki, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since this set's main purpose is to trap and KO dangerous Steel-types, Alolan Golem should be brought on the field after a teammate has fainted or via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn to prevent it from taking too much damage or having its Air Balloon popped. Preserve Alolan Golem's Air Balloon when facing an Excadrill team, as it absolutely needs its item in order to reliably KO Excadrill. Therefore, against Steel teams, Alolan Golem should trap Excadrill before attempting to trap another Steel-type like Ferrothorn. In order to trap Excadrill in the Ground matchup, play aggressively against it, even if it means sacrificing a Pokemon, in order to get Alolan Golem on the field for free and trap it. In fact, Alolan Golem puts a great amount of pressure on Ground teams, since Excadrill cannot possibly KO a Pokemon without being trapped in return. Another notable Steel-type Alolan Golem can trap, besides Excadrill and Ferrothorn, is Klefki in the Fairy matchup, as Alolan Golem can stall screen turns and slowly wear Klefki down before KOing it when one of the screens has a single turn remaining. If the opposing team doesn't carry any Steel-type Pokemon, Alolan Golem can then be used to switch into resisted hits, weak damaging moves, or predicted switches to set up Stealth Rock and damage the opposing team as much as possible before it's KOed. Once Alolan Golem fulfills its purposes of trapping Steel-types and setting up Stealth Rock or if it becomes deadweight, namely against Water teams, it can be sacrificed to a strong opposing hit so that a teammate can safely come onto the field and revenge kill the opposing threat. Avoid burns as much as possible, as they halve Alolan Golem's damage output, and at that point, it won't be able to effectively trap Ferrothorn or beat Zapdos anymore.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of Alolan Golem's teammates appreciate its ability to trap and KO problematic threats like Excadrill and Ferrothorn. Zeraora greatly eases the would-be painful Normal matchup with Choice Band-boosted Close Combat and heavily pressures Steel teams when used in combination with Alolan Golem. Zapdos can beat Grass-types like Breloom and Tapu Bulu with Heat Wave, while Rotom-W deals with Ground-types that trouble Alolan Golem, such as Mamoswine and Gliscor. Both Zapdos and Rotom-W can remove entry hazards away with Defog and provide another Ground immunity to the team. Tapu Koko can give Alolan Golem the chance to be safely brought on the field with Volt Switch or U-turn so that it can trap Steel-types unharmed. With Taunt, Tapu Koko can also prevent Defoggers like Zapdos from clearing Alolan Golem's Stealth Rock away after it's been KOed. Alolan Raichu can sweep late-game with the continuous chip damage from Alolan Golem's Stealth Rock. Examples of guaranteed OHKOs after Stealth Rock damage include those against Kyurem-B and, after a Nasty Plot Boost, Assault Vest Alolan Muk. With Alolan Golem taking out Excadrill, Alolan Raichu might even be able to drop Focus Blast for Grass Knot to let it swiftly beat Ground teams. Thundurus is a secondary physical attacker that nicely helps Alolan Golem by dealing with Mega Venusaur and Normal teams.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is used to pressure Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-types such as Mantine, Armaldo, and Mega Charizard Y. Return is Alolan Golem's reliable Electric-type attack, which allows it to hit Water- and Flying-types such as Tapu Fini and Skarmory. Stone Edge allows Alolan Golem to hit Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types such as Alolan Marowak, Zapdos, and Volcarona. Explosion is a powerful Electric-type move that deals massive damage and enables Alolan Golem to keep Stealth Rock up against slow Rapid Spin and Defog users. Earthquake can be used over Explosion to hit Electric-types such as Lanturn and Magnezone.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment along with a Adamant nature allows Alolan Golem to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed threats such as Clefable, Armaldo, and Alomomola. Galvanize turns Alolan Golem's Normal-type attacks into Electric-type attacks and slightly boosts their power. Focus Sash allows Alolan Golem to take any hit at full health, meaning it can almost always set up Stealth Rock safely.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Alolan Golem as a lead because it can always safely set up Stealth Rock thanks to Focus Sash. After setting up Stealth Rock, it's usually best to use Explosion, as it grants one of Alolan Golem's teammates a free switch and causes entry hazard-removing moves from slower Pokemon to fail, but be careful not to use it on Ground-types. Remove hazards before switching Alolan Golem in, as it is extremely difficult to set up Stealth Rock without Focus Sash. Use Volt Switch and U-turn from Pokemon such as Magnezone and Tapu Koko to bring Alolan Golem in safely. Avoid status, especially burn, as burn halves Alolan Golem's Attack stat while also breaking its Focus Sash. Don't switch Alolan Golem in on any unnecessary hits because it needs its Focus Sash to reliably set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos can remove hazards with Defog and beat Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu with Heat Wave. Zapdos is also immune to Ground-type attacks. Rotom-W can deal with Ground-types that counter Alolan Golem such as Hippowdon and Mamoswine. Tapu Koko can set up Electric Terrain, boosting the power of Alolan Golem's Electric-type attacks and allowing it to break through Chansey and Porygon2. It also has U-turn and Volt Switch so that Alolan Golem can be brought in safely. Alolan Golem in return sets up Stealth Rock, which Tapu Koko can take advantage of because it forces many switches. Alolan Raichu appreciates Stealth Rock from Alolan Golem helping it KO Pokemon such as Dragonite and Salamence, allowing it to sweep late-game. Similarly, Xurkitree appreciates Stealth Rock because it helps it KO certain threats such as Scizor. Magnezone can trap and KO certain Steel-types that give Alolan Golem trouble such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fire Punch is important coverage for Steel-types, allowing Alolan Golem to beat Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Wild Charge is its strongest Electric-type STAB move, which lets it beat Steel-types that are weak to Electric like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Empoleon. Earthquake is another important coverage option, letting it beat Steel-types like Stakataka and Excadrill. Stone Edge is its most powerful STAB move, allowing it to do significant damage to defensive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack is used to make Alolan Golem as strong as possible. 236 EVs in Speed with a Jolly nature are used to always outspeed non-Choice Scarf Excadrill after Sticky Web, as well as bulky Mega Scizor outside of Sticky Web. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to increase its bulk. A Choice Band allows Alolan Golem to always OHKO Celesteela with Wild Charge and bulky Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock damage with Fire Punch. Magnet Pull is essential to Alolan Golem's role as a Steel check, letting it prevent Steel-types from switching out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against weaker Steel-types like defensive Celesteela and Skarmory, Alolan Golem's decent physical bulk can be used to let it directly switch into these Pokemon. However, against offensive Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Excadrill, it's best to bring it in after another Pokemon has fainted, since these Pokemon carry super effective attacks like Superpower and Earthquake. It's also only capable of beating Choice Scarf Excadrill if it isn't locked into Earthquake. Be careful what move Alolan Golem locks itself into, since it could risk giving momentum to Steel-types like Heatran and Excadrill, which are immune to Fire Punch and Wild Charge, respectively. Be wary of Steel-types that can outspeed and pivot out of Alolan Golem in spite of Magnet Pull when Sticky Web isn't set, such as Jirachi and Magnezone. With its great Attack stat, solid coverage, and Sticky Web support, Alolan Golem can sometimes serve as an effective wallbreaker against Poison and Normal teams. In matchups where Alolan Golem has to take a Steel-type attack such as Celesteela's Heavy Slam or +2 Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, it's a good idea to preserve its health throughout the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle can set up Sticky Web for Alolan Golem, allowing it to outspeed offensive Mega Scizor and non-Choice Scarf Excadrill outside of sand, and Stealth Rock to guarantee an OHKO against defensive Mega Scizor. Mega Diancie can check Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo that threaten to OHKO Alolan Golem and appreciates Alolan Golem's ability to trap Cobalion so that it has an easier time against Fighting teams. Terrakion has a safer opportunity to beat Steel teams with Alolan Golem's ability to trap bulky Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela, all of which are able to check Terrakion. Tyranitar can use Pursuit to trap and remove special attackers that threaten Alolan Golem such as Latios and Gengar. In return, Alolan Golem is able to beat offensive Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Excadrill not locked into Earthquake. Cradily can switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks for Alolan Golem and check defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Swampert. Nihilego can beat Electric-immune Water-types like Mega Swampert and Gastrodon with Grass Knot and appreciates Alolan Golem's ability to trap Ferrothorn, enabling Nihilego to easily burn through Grass teams with Sludge Wave. Omastar appreciates Alolan Golem's ability to trap and remove Choice Band Excadrill before it's able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. This allows Omastar to beat Dugtrio, which prevents it from outright sweeping Ground teams.</p> "

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Slowbro's high Defense and Water typing makes it a good defensive pivot on Psychic teams, able to easily check threats such as Diggersby and Excadrill. In addition, Slowbro's ability Regenerator complements its role as a defensive pivot by healing it every time it chooses to switch out, extending its longevity throughout the battle. Furthermore, upon Mega Evolution, Slowbro's massive Defense and access to Calm Mind allow it to serve as a potent wincon late-game, and its ability, Shell Armor, supports its ability to sweep with Calm Mind by protecting it from critical hits. Slowbro also helps in the Steel matchup because it is a good switch-in to Excadrill and can threaten many Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn with Fire Blast and Heatran with Scald. Mega Slowbro also does well in matchups such as Poison, as it is able to directly take on every Poison-type with Calm Mind-boosted Psychic and takes little damage from Alolan Muk's attacks while removing it with Scald. However, despite its high physical bulk, Slowbro's Special Defense stat is lackluster, leaving it open to many special attackers such as Latios and Landorus. Being a Water-type leaves Slowbro weak to Electric- and Grass-type attacks, a trait exploited by common metagame threats such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu. Mega Slowbro is vulnerable to status conditions, namely Toxic, which greatly hinders its role as a setup sweeper, and it faces competition from other Mega Evolutions on Psychic such as Mega Latias and Mega Gallade, with the former punching holes in types such as Normal and the latter doing well in matchups such as Water and Flying.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Mega Slowbro is a great sweeper for Water-type teams with Calm Mind, as its good natural bulk, access to Regenerator as a pre-Mega ability, and reliable recovery in Slack Off allow it to set up relatively easily. Mega Slowbro's Psychic typing allows it to threaten key Pokemon on Poison teams like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, both of which can be difficult to for Water teams to overcome. Mega Slowbro's abilities complement its sets and the roles it plays, with its great pre-Mega ability in Regenerator combined with Slack Off allowing it to effectively act as a defensive pivot and its Shell Armor enabling it to set up with Calm Mind and Iron Defense without fear of critical hits. Mega Slowbro has an impressive Defense stat of base 180, which allows it to take on strong wallbreakers that would otherwise muscle through defensive cores on Water teams like Mega Gallade and Choice Band Diggersby. Its defensive capabilities are further improved due to Scald, as it can burn physical threats with the move, making it incredibly hard to break past. However, Mega Slowbro has a mediocre Special Defense stat, which makes it vulnerable to strong special attackers such as Latios and Tapu Koko, although it can beat most of them after a few Calm Mind boosts. Mega Slowbro also possesses weaknesses to types such as Dark and Bug along with Grass and Electric, compounding Water's weaknesses. Mega Slowbro is very slow, which means it will always take a hit before moving and is pressured by strong wallbreakers like Choice Specs Hydreigon. It is reliant on setup moves like Calm Mind and Iron Defense to pose as a threat, so Taunt users such as Mew and Jellicent can shut it down. Mega Slowbro is also susceptible to status moves such as Toxic, which greatly hinder its ability to set up and act as a defensive pivot, but this is not an issue if it is running Rest.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet can be used on Slowbro instead of a Colbur Berry because of its ability to punish physical attackers, and Leftovers is an option to increase Slowbro's overall longevity; however, not using a Colbur Berry hinders Slowbro's ability to check Dark-type Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo well. Ice Beam is an option over Thunder Wave to hit Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Dragonite and Garchomp; however, dropping Thunder Wave means that Slowbro cannot cripple Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Hydreigon by spreading paralysis. An Iron Defense / Calm Mind / Scald / Rest set can be used, as Iron Defense lets Mega Slowbro wall setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Calm Mind raises its Special Defense, and Rest makes it immune to status, making Mega Slowbro very hard to knock out after it accumulates a few boosts. However, Rest makes Mega Slowbro vulnerable to attacks while it sleeps. Psyshock can be used over Psychic to hit more specially defensive Pokemon such as Mantine, although most specially defensive Pokemon have ways of dealing with Mega Slowbro, like Haze in Mantine's case.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Sleep Talk can be used on the Rest set over Iron Defense; however, this forces Mega Slowbro to lose out on augmenting its Defense, allowing it to be more easily broken through by setup sweepers like Bisharp.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Alolan Raichu deal immense damage to Slowbro with their STAB attacks and can grab momentum using Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Celebi threaten Slowbro with their Grass-type attacks, although some of them such as Breloom and Ferrothorn can't afford to get hit by Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Bug-type Pokemon such as Scizor, Heracross, and Volcarona threaten Slowbro with their STAB attacks. However, most Bug-type Pokemon are afraid of getting hit by Fire Blast or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers: Special wallbreakers such as Gengar, Blacephalon, and Hydreigon do immense damage to Slowbro because of its poor special bulk. However, Mega Slowbro is able to take on special attackers after boosting several times with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic users such as Gastrodon, Chansey, and Swampert wear Slowbro down by using badly poisoning it with Toxic.

        "name": "Defensive Pivot (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Slowbro's main attack and can cripple physical attackers like Gyarados and Mega Lopunny with a burn. Slack Off is a form of reliable recovery and is used to ensure that Slowbro stays healthy throughout the battle. Thunder Wave is used to cripple fast Pokemon that cannot otherwise be beaten through Scald and Slack Off like Hydreigon, Greninja, and Latios. Fire Blast is used to hit Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon like Scizor, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs along with a Bold nature are used in order to let Slowbro serve as an effective physical wall. Colbur Berry is the preferred item on Slowbro, as it gives Slowbro the ability to take a Dark-type attack, which can be crucial when checking huge threats like Mega Sharpedo and Bisharp. A huge reason why Slowbro is an effective pivot lies in its ability Regenerator, which keeps it healthy throughout the duration of the game by healing it a bit every time it switches out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Send Slowbro in to soak up physical attacks like Mega Lopunny's Return and Excadrill's Earthquake and shield your other Pokemon from getting damaged. Use Slowbro as a pivot that can consistently heal itself with Slack Off and Regenerator. If Slowbro gets hit with a very strong attack, switch it back out in order to keep it healthy. Utilize Regenerator throughout the battle by constantly switching out Slowbro to keep its HP high. Because of the aforementioned reason, Slowbro is great for soaking up moves like U-turn. Avoid Toxic users such as Porygon2 and Gastrodon, as being badly poisoned wears Slowbro down and hinders its ability to check physical attackers reliably. In some situations, using Thunder Wave twice in a row is recommended, when the opposing player may switch a check directly into Slowbro, in order to cripple the Pokemon that is sent out. Use Scald frequently in order to inflict burns and wear down bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Celesteela. Preserve Slowbro's Colbur Berry until it is necessary to check Dark-type Pokemon, most notably Mega Sharpedo and Bisharp, later in the game. Use Thunder Wave in order to cripple Pokemon that cannot otherwise be beaten through using Slack Off and Scald such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Sharpedo. Thunder Wave is also useful in situations where you would need to cripple faster Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Pidgeot, while fishing for burns with Scald would be more useful against physical attackers or bulky Pokemon that can be crippled or worn down by burn such as Garchomp and Celesteela. Be wary of Taunt users like Mega Gyarados looking to shut Slowbro down; use Scald on a predicted Taunt in order to fish for burns, crippling the opposing Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Victini is a good partner for Slowbro, as it takes care of many of Slowbro's offensive checks such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu. When using a Choice Band, Victini can break past Slowbro's defensive checks such as Chansey and Porygon2. Victini will often need to switch out sooner or later because of V-create and U-turn, and Slowbro is an excellent partner for Victini to pivot out to, being able to switch into Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill for Victini. Choice Scarf Latios is able to offensively check many of Slowbro's checks such as Hydreigon and Blacephalon. Similarly to Victini, Choice Specs Latios can also beat defensive Pokemon that Slowbro struggles against. Latios also checks Grass- and Electric-types that would otherwise threaten Slowbro. Latios and Latias pair well with Slowbro for their Defog support, being able to remove Toxic Spikes and other hazards, while Latias is also able to heal Slowbro with Healing Wish. Celebi supports Slowbro using its Grass typing, which allows it to switch into Electric- and Grass-type attacks for Slowbro. Celebi can also use U-turn to pivot into Slowbro and can absorb Toxic poison with Natural Cure. Mega Latias pairs well defensively with Slowbro because Slowbro's physical bulk protects Mega Latias from strong wallbreakers such as Excadrill and Mega Lopunny that may threaten Mega Latias before it sets up with Calm Mind. Mega Gallade can beat defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Porygon2 for Slowbro. Slowbro can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing threats such as Greninja that could otherwise check Mega Gallade. Jirachi forms a solid defensive core with Slowbro, since it appreciates Slowbro's ability to switch into Fire-type attacks aimed at Jirachi, while Jirachi can switch into special attackers such as Latios and Mega Diancie that threaten Slowbro thanks to its Steel typing. Mew is a good partner for Slowbro because it beats Slowbro's defensive checks with Knock Off and Taunt and can also run Defog, which is especially good because it clears hazards such as Toxic Spikes that can threaten Slowbro's health. Offensive Mew sets also appreciate the speed control that comes from Slowbro's Thunder Wave, which can cripple fast threats and pave the way for Mew to sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind Mega (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind is Mega Slowbro's main form of setup, raising its Special Attack and Special Defense in order to sweep. Slack Off acts as Mega Slowbro's reliable recovery and works in tandem with Calm Mind in order to let it set up safety and heal off damage. Scald is Slowbro's most spammable attack and is useful for crippling physical attackers and wearing down Pokemon. Psychic allows Mega Slowbro to hit Poison-type Pokemon super effectively and is used over Psyshock in order to hit Toxapex harder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature ensure that Mega Slowbro will be able to take physical hits comfortably after Mega Evolving, notably Choice Band Diggersby's Return, and safely boost with Calm Mind. Slowbro Mega Evolves through Slowbronite, increasing its Defense and Special Attack. Regenerator is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving because it allows Slowbro to serve as a defensive pivot. Shell Armor, Mega Slowbro's ability, protects Mega Slowbro from critical hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Before Mega Evolution, utilize Slowbro as a defensive pivot that can heal itself with Slack Off and Regenerator. Be aware that Mega Slowbro loses Regenerator once it Mega Evolves. Thus, it is best to hold off on Mega Evolving and setting up until Mega Slowbro's checks and counters like Mantine and Tapu Koko have been removed. Mega Evolving Slowbro is also a good idea if the extra bulk is needed to check a certain threat that Slowbro wouldn't be able to otherwise such as Choice Band Diggersby or Dragonite. Take advantage of Pokemon Choice-locked into a move that does not threaten Mega Slowbro such as Victini's V-Create and Landorus-T's Earthquake in order to freely use Calm Mind. Try to remove entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes and Spikes before Slowbro comes in, as the former will leave Slowbro poisoned, putting a timer on it, and the latter will slowly wear it down when it switches in, hurting Slowbro's ability to switch into threats. Spikes aren't a huge threat to Slowbro until it has Mega Evolved, though, as then it cannot regenerate the chip damage caused by them as easily anymore. Steer Slowbro away from Toxic users like Porygon2, as being badly poisoned impedes its ability to set up and sweep. Similarly, in matchups such as Normal where Slowbro will be threatened by Toxic users, it is best to use it to bait burns or paralysis so that it cannot be affected by Toxic any longer. In matchups where Mega Slowbro does not have many setup opportunities, such as Fairy with Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu, prioritize attacking and fishing for burns with Scald over trying to set up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini in particular is a good partner for Mega Slowbro, as its Choice Scarf set helps keep faster foes in check and beats Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, while its Choice Band set serves as an effective wallbreaker that can punch holes in Pokemon that Mega Slowbro struggles against such as Chansey, Mantine, and Mega Venusaur. Mega Slowbro is also able to switch into Pokemon like Excadrill and Diggersby that could potentially harm Victini in return. Latios pairs well with Mega Slowbro because it can Defog away entry hazards, mainly Toxic Spikes, and it can support Mega Slowbro through the power it packs with its offensive Life Orb and Soul Dew sets. Latias, like Latios, is also able to support Mega Slowbro by checking many Pokemon that threaten it, such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Hydreigon, while also giving Mega Slowbro more setup opportunities by healing it with Healing Wish. Additionally, using Latias and Latios along with Slowbro can confuse the opposing player as to which Mega Evolution you are actually using. Mew is a good partner for Mega Slowbro because it is able to deal with many of Mega Slowbro's defensive checks by using Taunt and Knock Off with its stallbreaker set and use Defog to remove hazards such as Toxic Spikes that may potentially damage Mega Slowbro. Jirachi can switch into special attackers such as Latios and Mega Diancie thanks to its high Special Defense and can also heal Mega Slowbro with Healing Wish; in return, Mega Slowbro is able to protect Jirachi from physical attackers such as Excadrill and Garchomp.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind makes Mega Slowbro more powerful while patching up its middling Special Defense. Slack Off gives it reliable recovery, which lets it effectively act as a defensive pivot or bulky sweeper without getting worn down. Scald is a STAB move that has a good chance to spread burns and further improves Mega Slowbro's bulk by burning physical attackers, making it very hard to break past. Psychic as Mega Slowbro's secondary STAB move allows it to hit Pokemon that resist Scald like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Psyshock may be used over Psychic to win Calm Mind wars and hit special walls, such as Chansey, significantly harder. However, Psyshock is less reliable against Toxapex, as most Toxapex are physically defensive.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment along with a Bold nature makes Mega Slowbro incredibly physical bulky, allowing Slowbro to switch in on Choice Band Diggersby to tank the hit and then Mega Evolve to tank the subsequent hit and prevent Diggersby from getting a clean KO. The spread also allows it to avoid a 2HKO from Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech. Slowbro has the ability Regenerator before Mega Evolving, letting it effectively act as a defensive pivot. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Slowbro gains the ability Shell Armor, which allows it to safely use its setup moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid Mega Evolving Slowbro right away early-game, as it loses Regenerator upon Mega Evolving, which is incredibly useful for acting as a physical wall for Water teams. However, Slowbro should Mega Evolve as soon as possible against Normal teams to take on Choice Band Diggersby better. Early-game, Scald should be used often to spread burns and wear the opposing team down. Mega Slowbro has a mediocre Special Defense stat, so strong special wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Koko, and Hydreigon need to be taken care of before it attempts to set up. Pokemon that carry Haze or phazing moves, such as Mantine, Swampert, and Empoleon, also need to be taken out before Mega Slowbro can attempt to set up. Status moves and entry hazards, such as Toxic and Toxic Spikes, should be avoided at all costs, as they make Mega Slowbro very easy to check by putting it on a timer. Against Water teams, Mega Slowbro should try to get burned by Scald, as this prevents the opposing team from using Toxic and crippling it, thus allowing it to set up effectively. Against Poison teams, Mega Slowbro should not switch into Toxic Spikes, as poison severely limits its ability to be a Calm Mind sweeper. Mega Slowbro can set up on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, but one must scout for Toxic first to ensure safe setup.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex has very good synergy with Mega Slowbro, as it provides a neutrality to Grass and forms a Regenerator core with Slowbro, which can be very hard for opposing teams to break. Toxapex can even check threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, provide Toxic Spikes support for Mega Slowbro, and absorb Toxic Spikes. Swampert, Gastrodon, and Lanturn provide Mega Slowbro with a crucial Electric immunity, checking threats like Tapu Koko and Magnezone. Swampert also provides Stealth Rock support, which is useful for wearing down opposing teams and making types like Bug and Flying easier to deal with; Gastrodon has reliable recovery and good mixed bulk that allows it to better check Electric-type Pokemon for Mega Slowbro; and Lanturn can provide Heal Bell support, making it hard for opposing teams to wear down Mega Slowbro through Toxic. Mantine helps Mega Slowbro by checking special attackers such as Hydreigon and Volcarona. Additionally, it provides Defog support so that Mega Slowbro is not plagued by entry hazards like Toxic Spikes. Choice Scarf Greninja is a good teammate, as it can check fast threats such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko as well as Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latios. Keldeo breaks down walls such as Chansey, which are obstacles for Mega Slowbro if they carry Toxic. Keldeo also checks Dark-types like Hydreigon, while Mega Slowbro provides a defensive backbone for Keldeo by coming in on strong physical moves. Gyarados helps to check Grass-types such as Breloom and Tapu Bulu by utilizing its Flyinium Z set. Gyarados also acts as a secondary sweeper for Water teams and makes certain matchups, such as against Bug, a little easier. Sap Sipper Azumarill is a great teammate, as it not only provides a valuable Grass immunity to the team for checking threats such as Tapu Bulu and Breloom, but also acts as a check to Dragon-types like Hydreigon for Mega Slowbro. Azumarill can also take out walls such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn, with its Perish Song trapping set, which makes it easier for Mega Slowbro to set up. Suicune is a good teammate for Mega Slowbro, as it helps pressure Mega Slowbro's checks, making it difficult for a team to beat both.</p> "

        "name": "Iron Defense (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Mega Slowbro to patch up its lackluster Special Defense stat and tank special hits from threats like Latios and Greninja after a few Calm Mind boosts. Iron Defense allows Mega Slowbro to boost its gigantic Defense even further and shrug off strong setup sweepers such as Garchomp and Mega Pinsir, turning Mega Slowbro into an impenetrable force. Scald is the only STAB move on the set, as it offers good utility by having a very good chance to burn physical threats such as Tapu Bulu and Belly Drum Azumarill. Rest not only allows Mega Slowbro to fully regain its health but also makes Mega Slowbro unafraid of status-inducing moves such as Toxic.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment along with a Bold nature allows Mega Slowbro to be as physically bulky as possible and reliably check most physical attackers, including Diggersby. Regenerator as a pre-Mega ability allows Slowbro to be an effective defensive pivot for Water teams that is hard to wear down. Once it has Mega Evolved, it gains the ability Shell Armor, which gives it an easier time setting up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is important to not Mega Evolve early-game, as this causes Mega Slowbro to lose out on Regenerator, which is very important for it to stay healthy during the match and act as a reliable wall for Water teams. Since Mega Slowbro has pretty lackluster Special Defense, it should not be switched in against strong special attackers such as Landorus, as it risks getting severely weakened. Mega Slowbro should attempt to use Calm Mind against physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade as well as walls, as such Pokemon cannot do much damage to it in return and it can boost its Special Defense to endure special attackers on the opposing team. As Mega Slowbro relies on setup moves to pose a defensive threat, Taunt users such as stallbreaker Mew and Jellicent need to be removed before it can attempt to set up. Haze users such as Mantine and Toxapex also need to be removed, as these Pokemon can easily nullify all of Mega Slowbro's boosts and waste its PP. Additionally, Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex need to be taken care of, as Mega Slowbro's only attacking move is Scald and both of these Pokemon resist the move. Mega Slowbro should use Rest to get rid of status conditions such as poison and set up on status inducers like Celesteela. Rest should also be used to keep Mega Slowbro healthy to allow it to better tank hits from special attackers once it starts setting up Calm Mind, while Iron Defense should be used to check physical setup sweepers and Z-Move users such as Gyarados, Bisharp, and Belly Drum Azumarill.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that can cover Mega Slowbro's weakness to Electric such as Swampert and Gastrodon are appreciated. Both of these Pokemon can provide additional support for it, with Swampert using Stealth Rock to wear down Mega Slowbro's checks and counters and Gastrodon having reliable recovery and good mixed bulk to fare better against Electric teams. Toxapex provides a neutrality to Grass, which is important for checking threats such as Mega Venusaur. Additionally, Toxapex can provide Toxic Spikes support to wear down teams for Mega Slowbro and can also stop special set up sweepers such as Volcarona with Haze. Mantine can check strong special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y and Hydreigon as well as provide Defog support so that Mega Slowbro is not worn down by entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes, which may force it to use Rest. For stall teams, Alomomola is another good teammate that acts as a good mixed wall and can relieve pressure on Mega Slowbro to check physical attackers. It also forms a Regenerator core with Slowbro that is very hard to break past, provides Wish support to help with recovery, and checks threats such as Mega Venusaur by utilizing Mirror Coat. Sap Sipper Azumarill covers Water's weakness to Grass-type moves and checks Pokemon such as Breloom and Tapu Bulu, which can cripple or break past Mega Slowbro. It has an additional immunity to Dragon, allowing it to check Pokemon like Hydreigon. Teammates that can break the Mega Venusaur + Toxapex core such as Flyinium Z Gyarados and Groundium Z Greninja are also good teammates for Mega Slowbro. Keldeo is a good partner for Mega Slowbro, as it can take care of Water-immune Pokemon such as Mantine and Seismitoad with Hidden Power Electric and Secret Sword.</p> "

  "Muk-Alola": {
    "overview": "<h1>Poison</h1> <p>Alolan Muk is the premier specially defensive Pokemon for Poison teams by virtue of its above-average bulk and decent offensive presence. Additionally, its secondary Dark typing gives it a very important immunity to Psychic while leaving it with a single weakness in Ground. Alolan Muk's great bulk is only enhanced by its ability to efficiently run an Assault Vest, allowing it to serve as a great switch-in to strong special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y. Alternatively, Curse allows Alolan Muk to act as a bulky setup sweeper. The combination of Iapapa Berry and Gluttony grants Alolan Muk a reliable form of recovery, allowing it to set up Curse with ease. Access to Pursuit allows Alolan Muk to trap and eliminate otherwise dangerous Psychic-types such as Latios as well as Ghost-types like Blacephalon with certainty. Alolan Muk also has access to a strong STAB Knock Off, allowing it to remove the foe's item. This allows it to be very useful against Pokemon that rely on their items such as Eviolite Chansey and Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja. Alolan Muk's ability Poison Touch allows it to potentially wear down switch-ins such as Mantine by granting its contact moves a 30% chance to poison and stacks with Poison Jab for an overall 51% chance to poison. Despite its above-average special bulk, however, Alolan Muk has no way to recover its HP if it uses Assault Vest, so it can often be quickly worn down. On top of this, Alolan Muk's physical bulk leaves a lot to be desired and can be exploited by strong physical attackers such as Mega Gallade. Alolan Muk's Speed is also very lackluster, leading to it failing to outspeed just about any offensive Pokemon and certain problematic walls such as Celesteela.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p>Alolan Muk is the best Dark-type defensive check to Fairy-types with its Poison / Dark typing giving it a neutrality to Fairy. To supplement that already good defensive typing, it also has great special bulk and can serve as one of Dark's more reliable special walls. In addition to switching into Fairy-types, Alolan Muk's can take out Fairy-types such as Tapu Koko that are often difficult to KO for Dark teams thanks to its STAB Poison Jab. Poison Jab combines especially well with Poison Touch and makes Alolan Muk capable of spreading poison around very easily and risky to switch into. Its use of Knock Off and Pursuit makes it even harder to switch into or switch out of, as Alolan Muk can remove items like Porygon2's Eviolite and trap Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu. Outside of STAB attacks, it has good coverage moves in Rock Slide to hit Volcarona and Fire Punch to hit Klefki and Ferrothorn, all of which are threats to Dark teams. However, when its attacks aren't super effective, Alolan Muk's underwhelming offensive stats means that it can barely even damage walls and rarely threatens even attackers outside of poison. Even though Assault Vest Alolan Muk can take big special hits, its physical bulk is average, meaning physical attackers can take it on easily, and it has no way to heal at all, making it easy to slowly take down over time. Curse gives Alolan Muk use against types that Dark typically struggles against, such as Electric and Fairy.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Curse allows Alolan Muk to act as a bulky setup sweeper. Knock Off is Alolan Muk's main attack and grants it the ability to remove a foe's item such as Kyurem-B's Life Orb. Pursuit allows Alolan Muk to trap Pokemon that are looking to switch out, namely Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Blacephalon and Latios, which can threaten the team otherwise. Poison Jab is an option over Pursuit that allows Alolan Muk to hit Fairy- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Mandibuzz. Recycle allows Alolan Muk to reuse its Iapapa Berry after it has been eaten.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 12 Defense EVs allow Alolan Muk to tank Choice Scarf Victini's V-create after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense to maximize Alolan Muk's special bulk, allowing it to tank hits such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Gluttony allows it to consume Iapapa Berry earlier, giving Alolan Muk access to a reliable form of recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Alolan Muk depends on its Iapapa Berry and Recycle to keep its HP high, it should avoid getting its Iapapa Berry removed by moves such as Trick and Knock Off. Additionally, Alolan Muk should Recycle its Iapapa Berry as often as it can to keep its health as high as possible for later in the game. Alolan Muk should also avoid burns, as it depends on its Attack stat to successfully do damage. Use Knock Off to remove foes' items such as Chansey's Eviolite and Victini's Choice Scarf. Also, switch Alolan Muk into predicted Psychic-type attacks such as Latios's Psychic and proceed to trap the foe with Pursuit; do the same to take on Ghost-types such as Gengar and Blacephalon and weakened threats such as Protean Greninja after it has changed types.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Muk benefits the whole team by providing a key immunity to Psychic-type attacks and the ability to Pursuit trap Psychic-type threats. Crobat is immune to Ground and creates a solid defensive core with Alolan Muk. Additionally, Crobat can act as the team's Defogger, prevent walls from recovering damage with Taunt, and take on threats such as Mega Gallade and Kommo-o with Brave Bird. Mega Venusaur provides a neutrality to Ground-type attacks for Alolan Muk. Additionally, it can take on Water- and Ground-type Pokemon with Giga Drain and provide Alolan Muk with Leech Seed recovery. Toxapex provides the team with Toxic Spikes, which wears down the opposing team and allows Alolan Muk to muscle past its checks with more ease. Additionally, it can fish for burns with Scald, allowing Alolan Muk to set up more easily against physical attackers. Toxapex can also switch into weak attacks and easily brush them off thanks to Recover and Regenerator. Nidoking provides the team with an Electric immunity and has amazing coverage moves such as Flamethrower, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, and Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, which allow it to hit all Pokemon for neutral damage. Choice Scarf Nihilego is a faster Stealth Rock setter that can act as the team's revenge killer, since it can outspeed threats such as +1 Mega Charizard X and Garchomp. Salazzle has the unique ability of being able to poison Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Heatran. Additionally, it can also take on Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower. Scolipede and Gengar are less viable options on Poison teams, but they do match up well against Psychic-type teams, which Poison otherwise struggles with, freeing up Alolan Muk to use Poison Jab over Pursuit.</p> "

        "name": "Assault Vest (Poison)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pursuit enables Alolan Muk to trap and pressure Psychic-types such as Alolan Raichu as well as general special attackers that it forces out such as Magnezone. Knock Off is usually Alolan Muk's strongest STAB move and can be useful for removing items such as Eviolite and Leftovers from the foe. Poison Jab's considerably high chance to poison the foe allows it to be a good secondary STAB move that can wear down many of Alolan Muk's switch-ins, such as Mega Sableye. Fire Blast offers useful coverage to hit Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Its main purpose, however, is to avoid Alakazam's Counter, allowing Alolan Muk to safely break its Focus Sash and proceed to trap it. Although weak, Shadow Sneak is a decent option that allows Alolan Muk to fire off a move before going down, since it's very slow, and pick off weakened Psychic-types such as Victini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Alolan Muk's special bulk and allows it to always survive Choice Scarf Victini's V-create after a round of Stealth Rock. Poison Touch gives Alolan Muk's contact moves a respectable chance to poison defensive switch-ins such as Landorus-T. Assault Vest enhances Alolan Muk's special bulk to incredible levels, allowing it to fully serve as an amazing check to many of the metagame's special attackers such as Tapu Koko. A Sassy nature is used in order to increase Alolan Muk's Special Defense while not sacrificing Fire Blast's power. However, if a physical move is run over it, then a Careful nature is preferred.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Alolan Muk's main role is that of a special pivot, so it is safe to bring it in on special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Porygon-Z while it's healthy. However, since it has no way of recovering HP, Alolan Muk should not be worn down unnecessarily throughout the match. Avoid switching into entry hazards unless necessary in order to preserve HP. It is especially important to preserve Alolan Muk in matchups where it is needed to trap dangerous Pokemon such as Blacephalon and Latios, as these Pokemon have a much easier time against the rest of the team. Because of this, Alolan Muk is absolutely crucial in the Psychic matchup, as its stops Pokemon like Mew from simply using their super effective STAB moves and it puts consistent pressure in the matchup thanks to Knock Off and Pursuit. When trapping frailer Psychic-types such as Latios, it is always better to use Pursuit right away, as it will heavily damage them even if they choose to stay in. Alakazam should never be Pursuit trapped while at full HP, however, as it will always survive a hit thanks to its Focus Sash and KO Alolan Muk back with its Counter. Lastly, Alolan Muk should avoid burns from Will-O-Wisp and Scald, as this will cripple its otherwise respectable Attack stat and allow it to become setup bait for certain Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is a physically defensive tank that synergizes very well with Alolan Muk, as it can stomach physical attacks with its bulk as well as take on Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Swampert. Alolan Muk, on the other hand, can take on Psychic-types as well as most special attackers that can break past Mega Venusaur such as Volcarona. Toxapex completes an amazing defensive core between the two of them, as Regenerator in tandem with its ability to set Toxic Spikes goes hand in hand with Alolan Muk's ability to force switches and take on Pokemon such as Porygon-Z for it. Additionally, Toxapex can serve as a good physical switch-in and even burn physical attackers with Scald. Crobat is a good teammate, sporting a notable immunity to Ground, utility in the form of Taunt and Defog, and access to Flying-type STAB moves, allowing it to deal with stops to Alolan Muk such as Keldeo. Nidoking is a great special wallbreaker that can specifically eliminate Steel-types that trouble Alolan Muk, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, as well as provide Stealth Rock support for the team. Thanks to the presence of Pokemon such as Skarmory and Landorus-T, Alolan Muk often struggles in the Flying matchup. Nihilego is a great teammate that can cover this, as its coverage is almost impossible to wall in this matchup, and it can also set up its own Stealth Rock. Lastly, Gengar can free Alolan Muk's load in the Psychic and Ghost matchups thanks to its great offensive typing and can take on more offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gallade after minimal chip damage.</p> "

        "name": "Curse (Dark)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Alolan Muk's strongest STAB attack, providing secondary utility by removing items such as Klefki's Light Clay and Porygon2's Eviolite. Poison Jab gives Alolan Muk coverage for Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Mandibuzz, and Keldeo, has a chance to poison, and lets it act as a sweeper against Fairy teams. Curse lets Alolan Muk set up on a plethora of attackers and sweep teams. It also gives it Alolan Muk potential to take on opposing physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Aerodactyl. Recycle combined with Iapapa Berry gives Alolan Muk a form of reliable recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Gluttony lets Alolan Muk use a Berry after it drops to half its health or below. This, in conjunction with Iapapa Berry and Recycle, gives it reliable recovery. 248 HP and 12 Defense EVs let Alolan Muk survive Victini's V-create and KO it. The Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature maximize Alolan Muk's special bulk, which works well with Curse mitigating its weakness to any physical attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep Alolan Muk as healthy as possible throughout a game by using Recycle frequently, especially against types such as Water where it's more useful as a check to special attackers than as a setup sweeper. Similarly, if Alolan Muk can provide more utility through Knock Off, bide your time and don't try to force yourself into setting up until late-game when checks such as Choice Band Victini are weakened or KOed. Curse Alolan Muk's claim to fame is founded in the Fairy matchup, so set up against weaker Pokemon, notably Klefki and Choice-locked Tapu Bulu, and look out for Knock Off users like Azumarill and Clefable. Also, it will rarely be capable of outright sweeping from the get-go, so weaken some of its checks and go for setup late-game. Checks like Choice Band Diggersby are capable of switching in on Curse and forcing Alolan Muk out, so attacking them on the switch, especially early-game, could leave them crippled and potentially prevent them from checking Alolan Muk later on. Similarly, try to spread poison via Poison Jab to wear down checks. Knock Off does significantly less damage once the foe's item has been removed, so use Poison Jab in these cases for higher damage output. Avoid status, specifically burn and paralysis, and at all costs avoid Knock Off, as Alolan Muk losing its Iapapa Berry will cripple it for the entire game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon has Taunt to beat checks to Alolan Muk such as Taunt Gliscor and Haze Toxapex. It also provides a Ground immunity, forcing some prediction with opposing Ground-types like Nidoking. Knock Off from Alolan Muk helps Hydreigon break down walls like Porygon2 as well. Mega Sableye is able to bounce back status-inducing moves like Will-O-Wisp and entry hazards like Stealth Rock that quickly wear down Alolan Muk. It also weakens physical attackers, giving Alolan Muk more freedom to set up. Alolan Muk can be supported by means of Pursuit from Krookodile or Weavile to take care of some of its more common checks, notably Choice Band Victini and Diggersby. Tyranitar is able to spread status, set Stealth Rock to wear down foes for Alolan Muk, and take care of special threats, giving Alolan Muk more room to set up and relieving some of the pressure that special attackers force on it. Mandibuzz is able to clear hazards and check physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Azumarill that Alolan Muk would otherwise struggle with. Greninja can force out wallbreakers like Diggersby that beat Alolan Muk as well as set up Spikes to soften offensive checks lacking recovery.</p> "

        "name": "Assault Vest (Dark)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is a decent STAB attack that removes items, helping to take on Eviolite users such as Chansey and allowing Alolan Muk to more easily beat some Choice item users like Diggersby. Poison Jab is the preferred Poison-type STAB move because it has a 51% chance of poisoning targets thanks to Poison Touch and is reliable for beating Fairy-types. Rock Slide is a great coverage option that OHKOes huge threats to Dark teams such as Volcarona. It also almost always OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and deals significant damage to Mega Pinsir to prevent it from setting up safely. Fire Punch hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Mega Scizor better than any of Alolan Muk's other moves do, preventing them from setting up on Alolan Muk. Fire Blast does have a few advantages over Fire Punch, though, in being able to avoid contact with Ferrothorn, 2HKO Bisharp, and prevent Alakazam from using Counter, but Fire Blast does suffer from worse accuracy. Pursuit is also an option over a coverage move to hit Pokemon as they switch out, which can be helpful for taking out or at least chipping away at Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Mantine that Alolan Muk forces out.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 12 Defense EVs means that even after Stealth Rock, Alolan Muk will never be OHKOed by V-create from Choice Scarf Victini. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to maximize Alolan Muk's special bulk. A Careful nature is used with an Assault Vest to improve Alolan Muk's Special Defense even more. If Fire Blast is used, a Sassy nature should be used to avoid lowering its damage output. Poison Touch gives Alolan Muk an additional 30% chance to poison its targets and is especially effective with Poison Jab.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Alolan Muk can easily switch into most special attackers with its great bulk, and passive walls such as Chansey typically can't threaten it thanks to its Poison typing, so take advantage of these foes early-game to bring Alolan Muk into play often. If Alolan Muk is carrying Pursuit, you can play more riskily and switch it directly in against Pokemon it wants to trap, such as Latios, in order to secure the KO. Try to keep entry hazards such as Stealth Rock away to avoid making Alolan Muk take unnecessary damage, as the lack of recovery means that damage will add up fairly quickly. Early-game, use Knock Off liberally to remove as many of the opposing team's items as possible. For example, against Fairy teams, removing the enemy Klefki's Light Clay is a top priority early on to limit the number of turns that Reflect and Light Screen will halve the damage you deal. While using Knock Off, Alolan Muk should also use Poison Jab frequently to spread poison. In this way, Alolan Muk can cripple walls like Porygon2 in two ways, both by removing a crucial item such as Eviolite and by poisoning them. Be careful when trying to poison walls that can burn Alolan Muk, such as Mega Sableye and Mantine, though, as it hates being burned. In addition to halving Alolan Muk's Attack, burns start the timer on how long Alolan Muk can act as a wall. Make sure to preserve Alolan Muk's health in matchups where it is needed to check a high priority threat. For example, against Bug teams, Rock Slide Alolan Muk is the most reliable check to Volcarona, as even a +2 Inferno Overdrive with Stealth Rock support can't OHKO Alolan Muk, so it is important to not let Alolan Muk take too much damage early on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Muk is a great teammate for almost all Dark teams, as it serves as a Fairy check for offensive teams and a very bulky special wall for more balanced teams. Entry hazard control is important for preserving Alolan Muk's HP, so Mega Sableye and physically defensive Mandibuzz are frequent partners for Alolan Muk, as Magic Bounce can prevent Stealth Rock from coming up and Mandibuzz can Defog hazards if they get past Mega Sableye. Together, the trio form a great defensive core as well, covering all weaknesses effectively. While Sand Stream will chip away at Alolan Muk, Tyranitar is still a good option for supporting Alolan Muk. Tyranitar can use Pursuit, letting Alolan Muk bring coverage moves instead, and it also has Stealth Rock to help punish the switches that Alolan Muk can easily force. With Levitate, Hydreigon makes for a more offensive teammate that can help beat Ground-types for Alolan Muk. Hydreigon also takes on physical walls and particularly Steel-types very effectively, so Alolan Muk may find it easier to drop Fire-type coverage for other options. Greninja is another strong offensive Ground check, as its Ice Beam threatens almost every Ground-type. Greninja also uses U-turn for pivoting into Alolan Muk easily and Gunk Shot to relieve some of the pressure on Alolan Muk to check Fairy-types. Weavile can be helpful for relieving pressure on Alolan Muk, as it sometimes runs Pursuit to enable Alolan Muk to choose other coverage moves and can offensively check most Ground-types such as Garchomp.</p> "

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Cloyster is an amazing setup sweeper and late-game cleaner due to its access to Shell Smash, one of the best setup moves in the game. Cloyster's Skill Link ability in conjunction with moves like Icicle Spear and Rock Blast allows it to have very high-Base Power moves while also breaking potential Focus Sashes on Pokemon such as Breloom. A sky-high Defense stat allows Cloyster to set up Shell Smash against most physical attackers with ease, and a good offensive Water / Ice typing gives Cloyster opportunities to sweep many types, including Grass, Ground, Dragon, and Flying, once its checks have been taken care of. However, a lack of coverage moves forces Cloyster to rely on the less powerful Hydro Pump to hit Steel-types. Cloyster also has relatively low offensive stats, which means it needs to set up to be an offensive threat, and its very low special bulk makes it take lots of damage from even weak special attacks. This, combined with a poor defensive typing with only two resistances, means Cloyster can have a hard time finding appropriate setup opportunities. This causes it to be extremely reliant on a Focus Sash to help it set up, and this reliance on Focus Sash also causes Cloyster to be very vulnerable to priority, which can revenge kill it easily. A mediocre Speed stat causes Cloyster to be outsped by most offensive threats, some such as Choice Scarf Latios and Swift Swim Kingdra even after a Shell Smash. Finally, it can be hard to justify Cloyster a teamslot when it is outclassed in most situations by other late-game cleaners and setup sweepers such as Mega Sharpedo, Gyarados, and Azumarill.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>Cloyster is one of the most threatening Ice-type sweepers due to its Water typing and access to Shell Smash, which allows it to sweep types such as Fire and Rock if given the chance to set up. A neutrality to both Fire- and Steel-type moves allows Cloyster to heavily influence these matchups with Rock Blast and Hydro Vortex, being able to set up on Pokemon such as Infernape locked into Flare Blitz and Excadrill with ease. Furthermore, Cloyster's good offensive ability in Skill Link allows it to make good use of moves like Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, enabling it to break through Focus Sash from Pokemon such as Breloom, Alakazam, and Araquanid. A gargantuan Defense stat means it can set up in front of many physical attackers such as Excadrill and Mega Swampert easily. However, an abysmal Special Defense leaves Cloyster vulnerable to any decently strong special hit and diminishes its ability to set up as easily. Even resisted special hits, such as Scald from Keldeo, will dent Cloyster. Low offensive stats mean it is further dependent on a Shell Smash boost to pose as an offensive threat, since it doesn't hit very hard unboosted. Cloyster's mediocre Speed stat makes it somewhat easy to revenge kill, since it cannot outspeed key threats such as Choice Scarf Latios, and due to its vulnerability to entry hazards and Shell Smash's defense-lowering effect, it's easy to chip it down, possibly leaving it vulnerable to opposing priority moves such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>White Herb mitigates the defense drops from Shell Smash, but the safety offered by Focus Sash is more helpful.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>A Naughty nature can be used, but the loss in Speed isn't worth it, as Cloyster would be outsped by several Choice Scarf users such as Infernape, Blacephalon, and Terrakion. However, it does let Cloyster secure a 2HKO on Mega Swampert after very slight chip damage, as well as giving it more power before setting up Shell Smash, which it slightly lacks with a Naive nature. White Herb can be used to make Cloyster less vulnerable to priority and revenge killing; however, it sorely misses the one time nuke Waterium Z provides.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex resist both of Cloyster's STAB moves, allowing them to easily take any hit. They are then able to status it, hit it hard, or remove its boosts, depending on the Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Due to Cloyster's pitiful Special Defense stat, fast special attackers like Alakazam and Porygon-Z are able to easily OHKO it if it has not yet set up. Cloyster cannot even switch into resisted special attacks, as they will still do large damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Cloyster's reliance on Focus Sash to set up means that it will usually be at 1 HP while sweeping, so fast priority such as from Weavile and Dragonite can easily revenge kill it. However, if Cloyster is using Ice Shard, it may be able to get one hit off against slower priority users before getting KOed.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Most Electric-types are very fast and have high offensive stats, allowing them to OHKO Cloyster before it has set up or even outspeeding it after it has set up. In particular, Alolan Raichu can outspeed Cloyster in Electric Terrain even after a Shell Smash and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Magnezone can survive any hit from Cloyster and OHKO it in return, and Rotom-W can take any of Cloyster's attacks before pivoting out with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types resist all of Cloyster's physical attacks, forcing it to rely on the weaker Hydro Pump to hit them. Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn are able to easily take any of Cloyster's attacks even at +2 and can KO or outlast it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Even though most Fighting-types are physical, they are still able to deal massive damage to Cloyster, especially after a Shell Smash. While most of them are unable to tank hits from +2 Cloyster, Keldeo fears nothing from Cloyster and priority from Infernape or Breloom can pick Cloyster off.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types resist both of Cloyster's STAB moves and are mostly unaffected by Rock Blast, which can give free turns to several key threats to Ice teams such as Keldeo, which can launch a powerful attack, and Toxapex, which can freely set up Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to its pathetic Special Defense stat, Cloyster will easily crumble to even relatively weak or resisted special attacks. While this is mitigated if Aurora Veil has been set up beforehand, it is still quite disappointing—for example, it won't even be able to take any attack from Choice Scarf Latios if it has taken Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf users: Any Choice Scarf user with base 110 Speed or higher will be able to outspeed Cloyster even after it has set up a Shell Smash, meaning Pokemon like Gengar, Greninja, and Latios can easily revenge kill it, especially after prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Cloyster absolutely hates having to take unnecessary damage, since it heavily relies on its natural bulk, further supported by Aurora Veil, to set up and endure priority attacks. This means the extra damage taken from entry hazards, Stealth Rock in particular, can mean the difference between sweeping a team and being taken out either while setting up or versus a faster foe.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Avalugg, Swampert, and Toxapex can stop a Cloyster sweep cold due to their ability to erase its stat boosts through Roar or Haze.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Very physically bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Quagsire are able to take Cloyster's attacks and retaliate, beating it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status moves are heavily detrimental to Cloyster, since it relies on all of its speed, power, and longevity, which paralysis, burns, and bad poison severely reduce.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Shell Smash Sweeper (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shell Smash is what allows Cloyster to sweep, raising all of its offensive stats by two stages while lowering its defensive stats. Icicle Spear is Cloyster's main STAB move, which has an effective 125 Base Power thanks to Skill Link. It can also break Focus Sashes on Pokemon that could stop Cloyster's sweep. Rock Blast is a good coverage move that is affected by Skill Link and helps against Bug, Ice, and Fire teams. Ice Shard is a priority move that can be used to revenge kill threats before setting up and also hits Choice Scarf Latios, which would otherwise outspeed and KO Cloyster even after a Shell Smash. It can also be used to outprioritize threats such as Diggersby that attempt to revenge kill Cloyster with their own priority attacks. Hydro Pump is a secondary STAB move that hits physically defensive Pokemon such as Forretress and Skarmory, especially those that resist Icicle Spear.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment makes the most of Cloyster's sweeping potential, allowing it to outspeed most threats after a Shell Smash and making Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature gives Cloyster even more Speed and should be used with Ice Shard; on the other hand, a Naive nature boosts Cloyster's Speed without decreasing the power of Hydro Pump. Skill Link makes Icicle Spear and Rock Blast always hit five times and gives them an effective 125 Base Power, allowing Cloyster to break through many threats. Focus Sash almost guarantees a safe setup opportunity for Cloyster by allowing it to survive at least one attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Preserve Cloyster until near the end of the match, as it can be a great late-game cleaner once its checks have been weakened or removed. Since it is best to keep Cloyster at full HP to let it effectively set up Shell Smash, it is helpful to bring Cloyster in freely on a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from the likes of Pelipper or Lanturn or after an ally has been KOed. Similarly, entry hazards must be off the field before sending Cloyster in, especially as it is weak to Stealth Rock and the entry hazards will break its Focus Sash; it is very difficult to set up with Cloyster if its Focus Sash does not work. On the other hand, Cloyster can also sometimes utilize its massive Defense stat to switch into some physical attackers like Gyarados and Mimikyu and set up against them. Since Cloyster generally only has one chance to sweep, attempt to get rid of its checks and counters—in particular, bulky Water-types—before setting up. Similarly, priority users such as Dragonite and Weavile should also be removed before setting up, as they can revenge kill Cloyster when it's down to 1 HP. If Cloyster is running Ice Shard, it can also come in against weakened threats and revenge kill them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Fini and Mantine can use Defog to clear the entry hazards that can wear down Cloyster while also offering defensive utility; Mantine's Grass neutrality and amazing special bulk allow it to switch into many attacks that threaten Cloyster, while Tapu Fini's Misty Surge ability allows it to easily absorb status. Pelipper can set rain, which makes Hydro Pump hit much harder, while also sporting a Grass neutrality along with access to U-turn, which allows Cloyster to be brought in easily. In a similar vein, Rotom-W offers a slow Volt Switch that gives Cloyster free opportunities to switch in. It also has an Electric neutrality and can burn foes with Will-O-Wisp, slowly chipping at them. Lanturn also sports an Electric immunity thanks to Volt Absorb, can heal Cloyster of any status ailments with Heal Bell, and has access to Volt Switch to allow it to pivot into Cloyster easily. Entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Empoleon can set up Stealth Rock, which aids Cloyster's sweeping potential. Strong wallbreakers such as Greninja and Keldeo are able to weaken many foes and physical walls, allowing Cloyster to clean late-game. Z-Move users such as Azumarill, Manaphy, and Gyarados are great sweepers that can wear down shared checks with Cloyster.</p> "

        "name": "Shell Smash Sweeper (Ice)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shell Smash is an amazing setup move that enables Cloyster to sweep unprepared teams. Icicle Spear is Cloyster's main STAB attack, and coupled with Skill Link, it essentially reaches 125 Base Power. Hydro Pump, coupled with Waterium Z, enables Cloyster to bypass many of its would-be checks and counters such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor once it has set up. Regular Hydro Pump hits Steel-types for neutral damage, which otherwise would be able to wall Cloyster completely. Rock Blast is extremely useful to hit Fire-types that Hydro Pump can't hit super effectively such as Mega Charizard X and Torkoal, and it also comes in handy in the Bug and mirror Ice matchup, all of which are much harder without Cloyster. It can also hit Water-types that resist its STAB moves, but it doesn't hit particularly hard because of a lack of type advantage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Waterium Z enables Cloyster to use Hydro Vortex, which, with 144 Special Attack EVs, secures an OHKO on Mega Scizor at +2 after Stealth Rock. These EVs also ensure Cloyster OHKOes Skarmory with Hydro Pump when at +2. 252 Speed EVs and a Naive nature are necessary to avoid being outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Infernape. The remaining EVs are poured into Attack to power up Icicle Spear and Rock Blast. Skill Link is the ability of choice due to it allowing Icicle Spear and Rock Blast to always hit five times, making them very reliable attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its monstrous physical defense, Cloyster is able to easily set up on most non-super effective physical hits such as Infernape locked into Flare Blitz. Setting Aurora Veil with Alolan Ninetales helps Cloyster tremendously while setting up, allowing it to set up on even strong super effective moves like Horn Leech from Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and on some weak special attackers it otherwise wouldn't be able to, such as Clefable. Make sure to clear Stealth Rock and other entry hazards when attempting a sweep with Cloyster; the chip damage taken from them can be extremely detrimental when trying to set up. This is especially important versus Pokemon that can hit Cloyster super effectively such as offensive Scizor and versus specially offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Keldeo, which OHKO it if any hazard is up. Weakening Water-types with Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Alolan Ninetales is necessary due to them resisting both of Cloyster's STAB attacks and taking little damage from Rock Blast, which allows Pokemon such as Slowbro and Toxapex to completely wall it. Ideally, you should save Cloyster for late-game once its checks and counters have been removed from the game, though it could be used to occasionally switch into a physical attack for its teammates, especially versus types like Flying, which don't tend to carry priority or fast Choice Scarf users. However, be extremely careful of switching Cloyster into attacks, since it may compromise its ability to set up later. Cloyster should not attempt to set up on Pokemon that can status it with moves like Scald, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave, such as Toxapex, Mega Sableye, and Klefki.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales is an excellent partner for Cloyster, since it can set up Aurora Veil for it, which can help immensely while setting up, and check Fighting-type Pokemon, which can check Cloyster themselves. It can also use Encore on passive foes such as Celesteela to create setup opportunities and deal with bulky Water-types for Cloyster with Freeze-Dry. Kyurem-B is a terrifying wallbreaker for Ice teams that can pave the way for a Cloyster sweep due to its ability to heavily damage Pokemon like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur for it. Mamoswine and Piloswine can both set up Stealth Rock for Cloyster and its other teammates, which is a consistent way of dealing chip damage to Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. In addition, running Piloswine means Mamoswine is free to run a wallbreaking set, which can help break down Pokemon such as Porygon2 for Cloyster. Its access to Ice Shard can heavily damage Latios, which is a Choice Scarf user that can outpace Cloyster even at +2. Avalugg can use Rapid Spin to further support Cloyster when setting up, allowing it to stay at full health and helping it take decently strong super effective hits from the likes of Armaldo. Alolan Sandslash can run utility options; either Rapid Spin or Swords Dance are useful for Cloyster, since the former allows it to provide hazard removal support to its teammates and the latter lets it break through troublesome walls such as Toxapex with a boosted Earthquake. Rotom-F can provide useful Defog support and beat several Water- and Steel-types such as Toxapex and Scizor with its STAB Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire. Weavile is able to Pursuit trap troublesome Pokemon for Ice teams such as Victini and Latios with ease. Its access to priority in Ice Shard also allows it to pick off weakened foes such as Gengar, which Cloyster appreciates.</p> "

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>With high Speed and Special Attack, Gengar serves as an effective revenge killer, wallbreaker, and cleaner for Ghost. Choice Scarf Gengar's excellent Speed tier allows to outrun most of the unboosted metagame as well as most other Choice Scarf users. Gengar's Poison typing also comes in handy for absorbing Toxic Spikes against Poison and Water teams as well as putting heavy pressure on types such as Fairy. Gengar has a colorful movepool with coverage options such as Thunderbolt for Mantine, Trick for disabling walls such as Chansey and Zapdos, and Destiny Bond to lure and remove certain targets that threaten Ghost, such as Alolan Muk and Bisharp. Gengar is very, very frail, however, and is easily taken out by Pokemon that it cannot KO first. Its low defenses also leave it checked by strong priority users such as Scizor and Azumarill. Gengar is very vulnerable to Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Muk and Mega Aerodactyl, the former of which can switch in on any of Gengar's attacks and take it out consistently. Despite high Special Attack, the relatively low power of Shadow Ball and poor coverage of Sludge Wave as STAB attacks limit what Gengar can check effectively.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Gengar's high Speed and Special Attack make it an effective revenge killer and late-game cleaner, especially for Poison teams seeking an edge in the Psychic matchup. Its varied movepool gives it good offensive coverage and options to hit most switch-ins for significant damage, such as Focus Blast to hit Heatran. It can also cripple checks such as Chansey and Zapdos with Trick. However, Gengar's moves are individually easy to check,  so locking it into one with Choice Scarf can give opponents undue momentum, and Gengar's frailty means it has few opportunities to switch in and leaves it vulnerable to any attacker that it cannot KO first, although a Normal immunity can be useful to force Diggersby into mind games. In addition, Gengar faces competition as a revenge killer from Nihilego, which offers useful defensive utility with a unique Flying resistance as well as handy STAB coverage for pressuring Flying teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Destiny Bond can be used over Trick on Choice Scarf Gengar as an emergency button against offensive threats that it cannot KO reliably such as Mega Gyarados and Volcarona. It can also be used over Focus Blast alongside Trick to form a lure set for Alolan Muk. However, outside of this niche and the added utility of Choice Scarf Destiny Bond, there isn't much reason to use it over Focus Blast. Ghostium Z or Electrium Z offers Gengar a one-time nuke to remove certain defensive threats such as Toxapex and Celesteela. However, the Z-Move is generally preferable on other team members.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is a useful coverage option that can be run over Trick to threaten switch-ins such as Mantine and Toxapex. However, Thunderbolt's utility is generally limited compared to Trick, and Poison has other means of addressing these threats. A Life Orb all-out attacker set can be used should Choice Scarf Nihilego be run, but this set is a generally worse wallbreaker than Nidoking and is more easily checked. Destiny Bond is an option over Trick so that Gengar can act as an emergency check to setup sweepers such as Suicune and Z-Move Calm Mind Keldeo that can't be checked otherwise.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p><strong>Alolan Muk: Alolan Muk can easily switch into any of Gengar's attacks with its excellent typing and bulk and remove it from the battle using Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Mega Aerodactyl have an easy time trapping Gengar by taking advantage of it locking itself into Shadow Ball or Sludge Wave, preventing it from confidently checking offensive threats.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz can easily shrug off Choice Scarf Gengar's attacks and KO it in return with Dark-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types resist Sludge Wave and usually are bulky enough to take Shadow Ball easily, making it easy for threats such as Hippowdon, Landorus, and Garchomp to KO it in return with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Gengar's mediocre damage output leaves it comfortably walled by common special walls such as Zapdos and Chansey, although Gengar can cripple these Pokemon using Trick.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Due to Gengar's frailty, powerful priority attackers such as Azumarill, Scizor, and Bisharp can easily KO it and force Gengar's team on the defensive.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers: Non-Choice Scarf Gengar can easily be KOed by opposing revenge killers that outspeed it such as Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Greninja.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Alolan Muk: Alolan Muk hard counters Gengar and can easily switch into any of its attacks and remove it from the battle using Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Other Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Mega Aerodactyl have an easy time trapping Gengar by taking advantage of it locking itself into Shadow Ball or Sludge Wave, and they can prevent it from confidently checking offensive threats.</p> <p><strong>Immunities</strong>: All of Gengar's attacks have Pokemon immune to them: Steel-types are immune to Sludge Wave, Normal-types are immune to Shadow Ball, and Ghost-types are immune to Focus Blast. Thus, the presence of any of these immunities on a team can make Gengar very prediction heavy and easy to take advantage of.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types resist Sludge Wave and are generally bulky enough to survive Shadow Ball easily, making it easy for threats such as Hippowdon, Landorus, and Garchomp to KO Gengar in return with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Gengar's mediocre damage output leaves it easily walled by common special walls such as Zapdos and Chansey, although Gengar can cripple these threats with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Gengar's frailty, powerful priority attackers such as Azumarill, Scizor, and Bisharp can easily KO it and force Poison on the defensive.</p> </section>",

Be careful to preserve Gengar in matchups where it is necessary to check threats to the team such as Mega Lopunny or where its STAB moves are particularly useful, such as against Fairy. Use Trick to disable threatening walls to the team such as Gliscor and Chansey.

Focus Blast is excellent coverage that hits important threats such as Tyranitar and Heatran. Taunt is handy utility for disabling specially defensive walls such as Zapdos and Mantine, which might otherwise stall Gengar out with Life Orb recoil. Thunderbolt is an option over Taunt for hitting Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Celesteela harder as well as OHKOing threats such as Mega Charizard Y after some chip damage.

However, be careful about leaving Gengar in if there are Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Muk on the field. Taunt should be utilized to keep walls such as Zapdos and Chansey from recovering health and stalling out Gengar with recoil damage. However, make sure that such walls don't use the opportunity to launch an attack, as Gengar cannot take much punishment from even weak attackers. Preserve Gengar in matchups where it is necessary to check threats to the team such as Toxapex and Celesteela. When using Destiny Bond, take care not to reveal the move until the opportunity presents itself to lure a key threat such as Alolan Muk.

    "overview": "<h1>Fire</h1> <p>Due to a great offensive typing in conjunction with a massive Attack stat thanks to Thick Club, Alolan Marowak makes for a strong wallbreaker on Fire teams. Its ability in Lightning Rod allows Alolan Marowak to block Electric-type moves, most notably Volt Switch, allowing it to be a great switch-in for Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone, which can give Alolan Marowak opportunities to dish out attacks. Alolan Marowak is a far more threatening Stealth Rock setter than the passive and more common Torkoal due to its ability to pressure common Defoggers such as Zapdos, Mantine, Skarmory, and Crobat thanks to its sky-high Attack stat. Due to its Ghost typing Alolan Marowak serves as a great spinblocker, allowing it to keep up Stealth Rock versus Bug teams. However, its slow base 45 Speed and average bulk cause Alolan Marowak to get revenge killed easily. It is often outclassed by other physical wallbreakers such as Infernape and Victini, as they possess better Speed tiers. Alolan Marowak is also vulnerable to all entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock, which can wear it down quickly. It also does not appreciate Knock Off due to it relying on Thick Club to double its Attack stat, as without it, Alolan Marowak's wallbreaking potential is subpar.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>With Thick Club doubling its Attack, Alolan Marowak serves as a formidable wallbreaker on Ghost-type teams. Its access to Stealth Rock also allows it to double as an entry hazard setter.

Its Fire typing along with Fire-type STAB moves grants it the ability to hit Grass-, Steel-, and Ice-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Alolan Ninetales for super effective damage. However, its Fire typing also burdens it with a weakness to Stealth Rock, along with weaknesses to common types in Ground, Rock, and Water. Due to its underwhelming bulk, Alolan Marowak often can only switch in on attacks it resists or is immune to. Alolan Marowak is overreliant on Thick Club for wallbreaking, meaning if it loses its item, it loses most of its offensive prowess.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock provides the team with entry hazards, wearing down the opposing team throughout the match so Alolan Marowak's teammates can sweep easier. Shadow Bone hits a lot of the metagame hard, as a lot of teams lack Ghost-resistant Pokemon. Notably, it can be used to hit Slowbro for super effective damage. Flare Blitz is a powerful Fire-type STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Venusaur, Chansey, and Celesteela hard; however, using it alongside Lightning Rod may wear down Alolan Marowak. Fire Punch is a safer Fire-type STAB option for Grass and Steel teams, since Marowak's durability is valued more throughout the course of the match. Earthquake allows Alolan Marowak to hit Electric-, Poison-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Alolan Golem, Alolan Muk, Toxapex, and Tyranitar for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>228 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature allow Alolan Marowak to outspeed all 200 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Mantine, and slower variants of Mandibuzz. Maximum Attack investment allows Alolan Marowak to hit as hard as possible in conjunction with Thick Club. The remaining EVs are put into HP to maximize its bulk and to give Alolan Marowak an odd HP value so it can switch in on Stealth Rock more times. Lightning Rod grants Alolan Marowak an Electric immunity, allowing it to counter Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone, as well as block Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Alolan Marowak is a utility wallbreaker, so try and get it into battle as early as possible and switch it into resisted attacks or predicted Electric-type moves so that it essentially gets a free turn to set up Stealth Rock or dish out a powerful attack. It is very critical to keep Alolan Marowak healthy in Electric matchups, as it stops Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos from going for their Electric-type STAB moves, which includes Volt Switch. Alolan Marowak should be used to wallbreak in the early-game to punch holes in the opposing team. It should prioritize getting up Stealth Rock versus Dragon, Dark, and other Fire teams, as Alolan Marowak does not have the best offensive matchups and can enforce entry hazard pressure on these teams. Alolan Marowak is also a great Stealth Rock user, as it can spinblock and thus keep up Stealth Rock versus Bug teams. It can also threaten potential Defoggers such as Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mantine. Choice Scarf Latios will also have to make a decision between going for a sacrificial Defog in order to get rid of Stealth Rock or attacking Alolan Marowak. It is critical for Alolan Marowak to avoid Knock Off users, as it will lose its Thick Club, which will then cut Alolan Marowak's Attack stat in half. Use Flare Blitz only to break through walls that resist or do not take enough damage from Shadow Bone, such as Mandibuzz, Mega Venusaur, and Chansey, as this will wear down Alolan Marowak unnecessarily.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is a complementary teammate for Alolan Marowak, as it provides sun support with its ability Drought and can threaten Water- and Ground-types with Solar Beam. Mega Charizard Y appreciates Alolan Marowak as a teammate due to its ability in Lightning Rod, as it can switch into threatening Electric-type attacks for Mega Charizard Y. Mega Charizard X is also great teammate for Alolan Marowak, as it has a much easier time sweeping Dragon teams once Stealth Rock is up. Mega Charizard X also appreciates Alolan Marowak's ability to punch holes through the opposing team, weakening them for Mega Charizard X to sweep. Volcarona also can get rid of Dark-types that threaten Alolan Marowak with Bug Buzz, and it appreciates Alolan Marowak setting up Stealth Rock for it, allowing it to sweep more easily. Infernape is another great teammate that can threaten Dark- and Rock-types and faster Pokemon that would otherwise be able to get rid of Alolan Marowak like Excadrill, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Heatran is also a great teammate, as it is able to trap and eliminate physical walls with Magma Storm, and without the need to run Stealth Rock on Heatran, it is free to run Flash Cannon in order to get rid of Mega Diancie. Victini can also benefit from Alolan Marowak's wallbreaking capabilities, as it can get rid of Psychic-types, which can then free up a late-game Z-Celebrate sweep. Rotom-H provides a Ground-type immunity, can pivot with Volt Switch, and can provide Defog support to aid Alolan Marowak from taking damage from entry hazards. Rotom-H also provides dual screens support and, in conjunction with Alolan Marowak's Stealth Rock, allows teammates to sweep more easily. Volcanion is a great partner for Alolan Marowak, as it provides a Water immunity and is a special wallbreaker that complements Alolan Marowak as a physical wallbreaker. Alolan Marowak also complements Volcanion, as it provides an Electric immunity with Lightning Rod.</p> "

        "name": "Stealth Rock (Ghost)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock gradually chips away at foes residually upon entering the battle. Fire Punch is Alolan Marowak's STAB attack and hits Steel-, Ice-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Celesteela, Alolan Ninetales, and Tapu Bulu for super effective damage. Flare Blitz is a more powerful alternative to Fire Punch that can 2HKO bulky foes such as Mega Venusaur and Chansey but can be worse in matchups such as Steel and Grass where Alolan Marowak values longevity. Shadow Bone is Alolan Marowak’s other STAB move that can be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Slowbro and Jellicent super effectively while hitting the vast majority of the metagame along with Pokemon that resist Fire such as Rotom-W neutrally. Earthquake hits Poison-, Fire-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mega Charizard X, and Tyranitar for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>228 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Alolan Marowak to outpace Mega Venusaur and most Mantine variants. Thick Club along with 252 Attack EVs maximize Alolan Marowak's Attack and allow it to serve as an effective wallbreaker. The remaining 24 EVs are placed into Alolan Marowak's HP in order to improve its poor bulk. Lightning Rod gifts Alolan Marowak with an Electric immunity along with the ability to effectively check threatening Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone while also blocking Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Alolan Marowak is Ghost's premier physical wallbreaker, it should try to find as many opportunities as it can during a battle to switch in and punch holes in the opposing team. As a result of Alolan Marowak’s poor bulk, try to switch it into resisted attacks such as Celesteela’s Heavy Slam, as any strong attack may blow it away. Steer away from Knock Off users such as Mew, as Alolan Marowak will take an enormous amount of damage while losing its Thick Club along with its offensive prowess, hindering its ability to effectively wallbreak. In matchups such as Dragon where Alolan Marowak won’t be of much use due to its poor Speed, prioritize finding openings to get up Stealth Rock so that its teammates will benefit from it. Similarily, in matchups such as Poison, Grass, and Steel where Alolan Marowak’s wallbreaking prowess is valued, keep Alolan Marowak healthy throughout the game so it can come in multiple times and wallbreak. Try to preserve Flare Blitz for bulkier targets, as the recoil will unnecessarily wear Alolan Marowak down if it's used too liberally. Create opportunities to set Stealth Rock safely by forcing the foe into unfavorable positions. For example, Toxapex may want to switch out in order to avoid being threatened by Earthquake, giving Alolan Marowak an opportunity to lay down the entry hazard. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field before sending Alolan Marowak in in order to prevent it from getting chipped. If threatening Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko are still present on the opposing side, make sure to keep Alolan Marowak healthy enough to effectively check them with Lightning Rod.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The entire Ghost team appreciates Alolan Marowak's ability to break through defensive threats such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Alolan Muk. Mega Sableye is an amazing partner for Alolan Marowak, as it can switch into a plethora of attacks for it, including Dark-type attacks such as Knock Off, while keeping entry hazards off of the field and therefore keeping Alolan Marowak healthy due to its amazing ability in Magic Bounce. Mimikyu is able to check Dark-type Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Hydreigon for Marowak with Play Rough. In return, Alolan Marowak is able to set Stealth Rock for Mimikyu, chipping the opponent's team and thus allowing it to sweep more easily late-game while also beating Steel-type Pokemon such as Celesteela, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn that Mimikyu struggles to damage. Alolan Marowak appreciates Jellicent's ability to switch into and sponge Water-type attacks such as Suicune's Scald for it. In return, Alolan Marowak can switch into and check Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko for Jellicent. Decidueye is able to switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks such as Keldeo's Hydro Pump and Excadrill's Earthquake for Alolan Marowak while also using Defog to clear away hazards and thus keeping Alolan Marowak healthy by avoiding chip damage. Gengar and Blacephalon both appreciate Alolan Marowak's ability to set Stealth Rock and chip the opposing team down, allowing them to clean more efficiently. They are also able to check faster Pokemon that threaten Alolan Marowak such as Hydreigon with Focus Blast and Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice, respectively.</p> "

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Chansey is one of the best walls in Monotype, and it is mandatory on balanced Normal-type teams because of the roles it provides. It has Eviolite to boost its bulk, Natural Cure to act as a status sponge, Soft-Boiled for reliable recovery, and access to useful utility moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Chansey forms potentially the best defensive core in the metagame with Porygon2 and Staraptor; this core is further supported by Ditto and strong priority users like Diggersby that prevent most forms of offensive counterplay. Unfortunately, Chansey saps any momentum due to its cripplingly low Speed and nonexistent offensive presence. It's also susceptible to stallbreakers such as Mew and is reliant on Eviolite, which means it'll be disadvantaged by Knock Off users like Bisharp and Trick users like Latios. Chansey's lack of an offensive presence causes it to be setup bait for Pokemon like Taunt Gyarados and Refresh Mega Altaria. Defensive Pokemon that Chansey struggles to break, such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn, can also freely set entry hazards against it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Thunder Wave lets Chansey cripple Pokemon like Mega Pinsir and Kommo-o so that slower teammates like Diggersby can outpace and KO them. Aromatherapy lets Chansey act as a cleric but usually isn't worth it because Chansey can absorb status with Natural Cure. Wish lets Chansey heal teammates but isn't very useful because some of its teammates like Staraptor and Porygon2 already have reliable recovery. When running it, Chansey also has to give up important utility like Toxic.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion outpace and KO Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Knock Off: Pokemon like Bisharp and Mega Sableye cripple Chansey with Knock Off.

Seismic Toss lets Chansey damage Taunt users like Mew and allows it to wear down offensive threats like Keldeo on the switch in. Toxic lets Chansey wear through walls like Mantine and Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Eviolite amplifies Chansey’s bulk, allowing it to check special attackers like Tapu Koko and Greninja much more comfortably. 248 HP and 252 Defense EVs and a Bold nature maximize Chansey's physical bulk, allowing it to take on physical attackers like Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Crobat, and it boasts naturally high Special Defense. Natural Cure cures Chansey of any status as it switches out, allowing it to switch into status users like Zapdos for its teammates.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Prioritize setting Stealth Rock, especially against types like Fire and Bug where its very important to chip threats like Heatran and Heracross, respectively. Play safely with Chansey in matchups like Bug, Dragon, and rain Water so that it can check Pokemon like Volcarona, Hydreigon, and Kingdra more consistently. For example, if Chansey has switched into a Hydreigon, play safely and heal instead of trying to cripple a switch-in with Toxic so that you can check Hydreigon more reliably later on in the game. It's also very important to heal consistently against pivot-centric types like Electric that chip Chansey down quickly and force it out with powerful wallbreakers like Alolan Golem. If given the opportunity, surprise Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine with Toxic on the switch in. Play aggressively against Taunt users like Mew by switching out to something that can handle them on a predicted Taunt. Utilize Natural Cure to absorb status for teammates like Porygon2 and Staraptor. For example, if Porygon2 is matched up against a Celesteela, scout for a potential Toxic by swapping out to Chansey. Use Chansey as a defensive pivot, tanking hits from Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie throughout games. Play cautiously against Trick users like Latios and Knock Off users like Gliscor and Mandibuzz, as if Chansey switches into a Trick from Choice Scarf Latios it becomes into a liability, and if it loses its item to Knock Off, it becomes more vulnerable to attackers like Greninja.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Porygon2 acts as Chansey's physically defensive partner, capable of taking on Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Victini. Staraptor checks Fighting-types like Heracross and removes problematic entry hazards like Toxic Spikes for Chansey. Mega Lopunny beats huge threats such as Mega Sableye that Chansey struggles with. Ditto helps mitigate Chansey's weakness to setup Pokemon like Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Diggersby breaks through walls like Ferrothorn for Chansey and can handle defensive cores on types like Water and Poison that Chansey struggles with. Porygon-Z is a late-game cleaner that takes advantage of Chansey's ability to chip down the opponent's team with Stealth Rock and Toxic and can break through walls like SubToxic Zapdos that Chansey could potentially struggle with. Choice Specs Meloetta breaks walls like Clefable that are unafraid of Chansey's Toxic. Mega Pidgeot helps against Steel teams by beating Pokemon like Ferrothorn for Chansey; it can also deal with problematic Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and revenge kill Fighting-types like Keldeo and Mega Gallade.</p> "

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir has high Attack and Speed stats along with Swords Dance, which make it an excellent late-game sweeper. It also has good bulk, meaning that it has many opportunities to set up Swords Dance. Once Pinsir Mega Evolves, it gains a Flying typing along with the ability Aerilate, changing its Normal-type attacks into Flying-type attacks, allowing Mega Pinsir to easily revenge kill many threats with Quick Attack. Mega Pinsir is also fast, being able to outspeed threats such as Kyurem-B and Landorus. However, Mega Pinsir has a devastating weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning Rapid Spin support from Armaldo or Forretress is necessary. Its Flying typing adds a weakness to Electric- and Ice-type attacks while also stacking a weakness to Rock-type attacks. Mega Pinsir also faces competition from Mega Scizor and Mega Heracross, as Mega Scizor is a bulky setup sweeper with reliable recovery, while Mega Heracross is a fearsome wallbreaker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earthquake can be used as an alternative way to hit Steel-types, but it is outclassed by Close Combat because the latter can hit Skarmory and Celesteela. Hyper Cutter can be run to better deal with Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados, but they are too uncommon to justify using it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Fast Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu can take an Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack and KO Mega Pinsir with their Electric-type attacks. Defensive Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos can take multiple hits from Mega Pinsir and either status it or KO it with their Electric-type attacks.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Mega Pinsir to boost its Attack stat, allowing it to be a good setup sweeper. Return is Mega Pinsir's main STAB Flying-type attack and hits Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-types such as Breloom, Mega Venusaur, and Volcarona. Quick Attack is a strong priority move that allows Mega Pinsir to revenge kill fast threats such as Infernape and Mega Gallade. Close Combat is coverage that hits Steel- and Rock-types that would otherwise wall Mega Pinsir such as Heatran and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Pinsir to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly Nature ensures that Pinsir is as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Kyurem-B and Garchomp. Moxie is the preferred ability over Hyper Cutter and Mold Breaker because it lets Pinsir boost its Attack stat if it KOes a Pokemon before Mega Evolving. Pinsirite allows Pinsir to become Mega Pinsir while also granting it the ability Aerilate. Aerilate turns its Normal-type attacks into Flying-type attacks and gives them a slight boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Remove entry hazards before sending in Mega Pinsir, as it gains a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock when it Mega Evolves. If Pinsir can KO a weakened target, it is usually best not to Mega Evolve so Pinsir can get an Attack boost from Moxie. However, trying to get a free Moxie boost is extremely predictable and can give the opponent a free switch because of Pinsir's mediocre Attack stat. Avoid unnecessarily switching into attacks because Mega Pinsir needs to be at high HP to take most powerful attacks. Use Mega Pinsir early-game to wallbreak to possibly help Heracross and Volcarona clean late-game, while late-game it should be used to sweep the opponent's team. Use pivots such as U-turn Scizor and Volt Switch Galvantula so Mega Pinsir can be brought in safely. Avoid status, especially burn and paralysis, because burns halve its Attack stat, while paralysis leaves it susceptible to revenge killers. Mega Pinsir only has decent Defense, so it is best to set up on a predicted switch or Ground-type attack so Mega Pinsir doesn't take unnecessary damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Armaldo and Forretress can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin while also being able to set up Stealth Rock, making it easier for Mega Pinsir to sweep. Scizor can pivot using U-turn, allowing Mega Pinsir to be brought in safely. Scizor can also run Defog to remove Stealth Rock for Mega Pinsir and check Ice- and Rock-types with its STAB Technician-boosted Bullet Punch. Galvantula can set up Sticky Web, allowing Mega Pinsir to outspeed faster threats such as Choice Scarf Victini and Greninja, and eliminate some of Mega Pinsir's checks and counters such as Skarmory and Staraptor. Volcarona can eliminate physical walls such as Skarmory and Landorus-T with its powerful special attacks, while Mega Pinsir can KO special walls such as Chansey and Empoleon. Volcarona can also set up on Mega Pinsir's checks such as Zapdos and Doublade, while Mega Pinsir can set up on Alolan Muk and Chansey. Heracross, Buzzwole, and Scolipede can use their powerful Bug-type attacks to eliminate bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew that can cripple Mega Pinsir. Araquanid can switch into powerful special Fire-type attacks from the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona while also being a good switch-in for Will-O-Wisp and Scald, preventing Mega Pinsir from being burned.</p> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Gyarados's high Attack stat and access to Dragon Dance allow it to be a potent setup sweeper. Its Water typing is helpful against Rock and Ice teams, which are usually problematic for Flying. A great ability in Moxie improves Gyarados's sweeping potential even further by boosting its Attack every time it gets a KO, and its solid bulk allows it to set up more easily. However, while Bounce is a decent STAB move, its charging turn requires Gyarados to use a Flyinium Z to break past bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur. Gyarados's Water typing can be useful in some situations, but it also has its drawbacks, as it gives an even bigger Electric weakness to Flying teams. Though base 81 does put Gyarados at a unique Speed tier, allowing it to barely outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Dragonite, it is overall mediocre, preventing Gyarados from outspeeding some Pokemon even at +1, such as Mega Alakazam. Gyarados can also lose to many common Choice Scarf users such as Nihilego and Xurkitree. Finally, Gyarados can be outclassed in some situations by other Z-Move users such as Salamence and Landorus-T, but it does hold a niche over them due to its access to Taunt, which allows it to not be walled by certain bulky Pokemon and set up against them.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Gyarados is one of the strongest Pokemon on Water, breaking huge defensive threats such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn with a boosted Supersonic Skystrike. It has access to two good abilities, Moxie and Intimidate. The former improves Gyarados's sweeping potential after it gets a KO, while the latter allows it to set up more easily on physical attackers. Gyarados's decent bulk in conjunction with Intimidate gives it almost no problem setting up, as it can take most weaker neutral attacks easily. However, Moxie is generally more useful because Gyarados has a much easier time snowballing teams without having to Dragon Dance multiple times to get vital KOs. Gyarados has access to Taunt, which means it can set up on phazers such as Skarmory or walls looking to cripple it with status such as Gastrodon. Gyarados's typing gives it a good number of useful resistances to types such as Fighting and an immunity to Ground-type moves. It notably takes only neutral damage from Grass-type attacks but has a crippling weakness to Electric-type attacks. It is also immune to Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Gyarados can outpace the majority of unboosted Pokemon, notably Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, at +1. However, Gyarados's Speed stat leaves much to be desired, as before setup it is very susceptible to attacks from faster Pokemon such as Kyurem-B; even at +1, it is still easily revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini. Gyarados also has a hard time setting up in certain matchups and gets outright walled by Pokemon such as Rotom-W; other factors, such as its weakness to Stealth Rock, can also make setting up difficult. Bounce takes a turn to charge, which makes it useless against Pokemon such as Baneful Bunker Toxapex and Protect Ferrothorn after Flyinium Z has been used.</p> ",

Mega Gyarados running Dragon Dance, Crunch, Waterfall, and Earthquake can power through types like Psychic, and Mold Breaker is great for Pokemon such as Rotom-W.

Electric-type Pokemon also often have high Speed and good offensive stats, meaning Gyarados is usually outsped by common threats such as Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain even after a Dragon Dance or two. They also resist Supersonic Skystrike, meaning Gyarados often lacks the power to KO these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Nihilego and Xurkitree can outspeed +1 Gyarados if holding a Choice Scarf and OHKO Gyarados with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Status: Gyarados greatly dislikes status, as most status conditions can easily cripple it. Toxic wears Gyarados down extremely fast, making it more liable to a revenge kill, while paralysis and burn cripple Gyarados's offensive stats.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Gyarados has a hard time breaking through physical walls such as Toxapex and Skarmory, especially as they both can eliminate Gyarados's stat boosts. However, Gyarados can shut them down with Taunt, disallowing them to phaze it while it sets up.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Gyarados loses a hefty 25% of its health each time it switches into Stealth Rock, making it much easier to KO, especially as Gyarados lacks reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Protect Users</strong>: Protect users like Ferrothorn and Baneful Bunker Toxapex can easily wall Gyarados after it has used up Supersonic Skystrike, as they take little damage from Waterfall and will never take damage from Bounce. Gyarados should also be careful when using Supersonic Skystrike on these Pokemon because Protect can weaken it severely.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Most Electric-types can outspeed Gyarados, and Surge Surfer Alolan Raichu can outpace even a +2 Gyarados and revenge kill it. Bulkier Electric-types such as Rotom-W can switch in on any of Gyarados's attacks and have a good chance to OHKO it with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users</strong>: Pokemon like Toxapex and Skarmory eat up Gyarados's attacks and can prevent it from sweeping with Haze or a phazing move such as Whirlwind. Even though Taunt can prevent this, Skarmory's Brave Bird in conjunction with Rocky Helmet chip damage makes it very hard for Gyarados to sweep and Toxapex's Scald can burn Gyarados, neutralizing it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls, most notably Toxapex, really annoy Gyarados, as Baneful Bunker makes it very hard to sweep. Substitute sets loses to Toxapex because they can't prevent Haze without Taunt and also can't KO it without boosts. On the other hand, if the Taunt variation gets burned by Scald, Gyarados's sweeping potential is very limited. Other walls such as Porygon2 can tank any of Gyarados's attacks and cripple it with Foul Play, Toxic, or Discharge.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Terrakion can outpace even a +1 Gyarados and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic poison breaks Gyarados down quickly, while paralysis prevents a sweep. Burns turn Gyarados into a liability, as it becomes free setup bait for the opposition.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock wears down Gyarados so that it can be revenge killed much more easily. Stealth Rock also makes it much harder for Gyarados to set up, especially when it has to take an attack.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts both Gyarados's Attack and Speed, powering up its physical attacks while letting it outspeed quite a few Pokemon, including Mega Beedrill and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Bounce is Gyarados's Flying-type STAB move and has a nifty 30% chance to paralyze the foe, but it has a charge turn that can be exploited by opponents who can then switch out into a Pokemon that resists it. When Bounce is used with Flyinium Z, it turns into a powerful 160-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike, which can be used to KO a bulky foe like Toxapex. However, it is a one-time move, so it should be used only when needed. Waterfall is Gyarados's primary STAB move and can be used to hit Rock-type Pokemon that Flying teams struggle against. Substitute can be used against bulky Pokemon that cannot break Gyarados's substitute easily, such as Toxapex, and it also shields Gyarados from status such as poison and Scald burns, allowing Gyarados to set up easily. Taunt can be used to shut down support and bulky Pokemon such as Celesteela, giving Gyarados ample opportunities to set up with Dragon Dance. It can also be used to prevent status from moves such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, which Gyarados greatly dislikes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment maximizes Gyarados's sweeping potential. A Jolly nature ensures that Gyarados outspeeds Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Togekiss, and Mega Manectric after a Dragon Dance. Flyinium Z turns Bounce into a powerful Supersonic Skystrike that can be used to KO Gyarados's would-be checks after a Dragon Dance. Moxie boosts Gyarados's Attack every time it gets a KO, effectively snowballing into a sweep once Gyarados can set up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Dragon Dance to set up against Ground-, Fighting-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon that Gyarados threatens, such as Gliscor, Keldeo, and Volcarona. This can give Gyarados free opportunities to set up as they switch out. However, you should avoid switching Gyarados into attacks, as they can wear it down and make it unable to set up properly. Similarly, attempt to remove Stealth Rock before Gyarados enters the battlefield. After a Dragon Dance or two, use Supersonic Skystrike to KO Pokemon that would otherwise wall Gyarados such as Toxapex. It is also best to avoid letting Gyarados get inflicted with status, as burns and paralysis halve one of Gyarados's offensive stats, while Toxic poison can rack up, making Gyarados much easier to revenge kill. Also be careful about wasting Supersonic Skystrike, especially if it is needed to break past a certain Pokemon like Porygon2. However, Supersonic Skystrike can be used as the first move to semi-guarantee a Moxie boost. Against support Pokemon or walls such as Celesteela and Jirachi, use Substitute to block incoming status moves and start setting up with Dragon Dance. If Gyarados is running Taunt, use it to shut down bulkier and support Pokemon such as Clefable, giving Gyarados free opportunities to set up, either by forcing them to switch out or by taking little damage from their attacks. It is also helpful to eliminate Gyarados's checks, including bulky Water-types, Electric-types, and Protect users such as Toxapex, Magnezone, and Ferrothorn before bringing it in, as they can usually stop a sweep and force Gyarados out. It is better to set up with Gyarados late-game, especially as it usually only has one chance to sweep because of Flyinium Z's one-time use. When applicable, use Dragon Dance at least two times to avoid getting Gyarados revenge killed by fast Choice Scarf users such as Nihilego.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gyarados is useful on Flying teams due to its ability to check Rock and Ice teams, allowing Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite to be used more effectively due to Gyarados dealing with their checks such as Terrakion and Weavile. Additionally, Mega Charizard Y can deal with physical walls that Gyarados struggles with such as Rotom-W and Skarmory. Defoggers such as Mantine and Skarmory remove Stealth Rock, which Gyarados dislikes; however, Mantine shares its typing with Gyarados, which makes for a defensive redundancy. Skarmory can also set up Stealth Rock, aiding Gyarados's sweeping potential. Zapdos can easily take most Electric-type attacks for Gyarados, remove entry hazards, and bring Gyarados in safely with Volt Switch. Landorus provides an Electric immunity for Gyarados and can deal large damage to most Electric-type Pokemon and Toxapex. It is also a special wallbreaker that is able to deal with most physical walls that give Gyarados trouble, and it can set up Stealth Rock on top of that. Landorus-T provides another Electric immunity, takes care of Electric-type Pokemon, can set up Stealth Rock, and has Intimidate, which can help Gyarados set up against physical threats. It can also bring Gyarados in safely with U-turn. Gliscor can work as an effective stallbreaker, wearing down Pokemon to ease Gyarados's sweep. It also provides another Electric immunity while being able to spread Toxic to aid Gyarados's setup. Gliscor's utility set can also set up Stealth Rock, making it easier for Gyarados to sweep. Aerodactyl can set up Stealth Rock instead of Landorus or Skarmory, allowing them to run either a different attack in Landorus's case or Spikes in Skarmory's case. Finally, defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela can sponge hits for Gyarados while wearing down foes with their support moves.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance Sweeper (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Gyarados's Attack and Speed; after a single boost, it can outpace metagame threats such as Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie. Bounce along with Flyinium Z allows Gyarados to blow past Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur. Bounce is a two-turn attack after Flyinium Z is used, which makes it very susceptible to Protect users that don't care about Waterfall, such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn. However, it has a chance to paralyze foes, which can be helpful in certain situations. Waterfall is Gyarados's most reliable STAB move that hits Pokemon that resist Bounce, such as Skarmory and Tyranitar. It also has 100% accuracy, unlike Bounce, and a chance to flinch. Taunt allows Gyarados to shut down and freely set up against walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Substitute allows Gyarados to avoid status. Gyarados's teammates can help it set up on weaker physical attackers such as Ferrothorn by burning them with Scald, leaving the foes unable to break Gyarados's Substitute. Gyarados can also use Substitute and Dragon Dance liberally on weaker resisted special attacks from Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Torkoal. Taunt is generally more useful to break through teams; however, Substitute allows Gyarados to set up on weak attacks and be safe from Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini revenge killing it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used to maximize Gyarados's power. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are used so Gyarados can outpace offensive threats such as Breloom and Bisharp before setup. A Jolly nature also lets it outpace other threats such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and some Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Bulu at +1. Moxie allows Gyarados to sweep teams much more easily after a KO or two. Intimidate eases Gyarados's setup against physical attackers and allows it to use Taunt more freely against slower physical attackers. Intimidate also forces some physical attackers to switch, giving it a free turn to set up. Flyinium Z gives Gyarados a one-time 160-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike to power through walls and get an easier Moxie boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Dragon Dance on walls such as Clefable, on resisted attacks from Pokemon such as Scizor, or to capitalize on Choice Scarf users being locked into attacks that Gyarados resists or is immune to such as Fire Blast or Earthquake. Utilize Taunt against Pokemon like Skarmory and Toxapex to prevent them from removing Gyarados's boosts. Similarly, use Taunt against walls that might have Toxic or Thunder Wave, such as Gastrodon and Chansey. You can also lead with Gyarados and use Taunt against slower entry hazard users such as Clefable and Skarmory to prevent hazards being set up. Capitalize on forced switches by setting up Dragon Dance. However, be careful if your opponent switches out to a faster Choice Scarf revenge killer such as Nihilego or Victini that can KO Gyarados before it does any damage. Use Substitute against passive walls to prevent status. This is especially important against weaker Pokemon that carry Scald such as Gastrodon, as the secondary effect of a burn can possibly ruin Gyarados's sweep if a Substitute isn't up. Pokemon such as Torkoal and Swampert can also otherwise put Gyarados to sleep with Yawn, preventing a sweep. Fish for Scald burns with teammates to make setup easier against physical attackers. Preserve Gyarados's health and Flyinium Z in matchups against types such as Grass and Poison, as it is very important to use the Z-Move to KO problematic Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex, and avoid wasting it on a resisted target or one that uses Protect. Eliminate fast revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Victini so Gyarados doesn't have to worry about trying to get multiple Dragon Dance boosts before sweeping. Try to avoid switching into even resisted attacks unless necessary, as chip damage can leave Gyarados too weak to safely set up and sweep. Moreover, remove Stealth Rock before attempting to set up, as it greatly hinders Gyarados's sweeping potential. Keep in mind that Gyarados greatly threatens types such as Bug and Rock, so making double switches into more passive Pokemon that you can set up on can easily tilt the momentum in Gyarados's favor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Empoleon provides Defog support to prevent Gyarados from taking unnecessary Stealth Rock damage while setting Stealth Rock itself to wear down the foes for an easier sweep. Empoleon also switches into powerful Rock-type attacks from threatening Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. Swampert can set Stealth Rock and switch into Electric-type attacks that could potentially KO Gyarados. Swampert can also put a Pokemon to sleep with Yawn, which can be used for free setup bait for Gyarados late-game. Gastrodon provides an Electric-type immunity and thus can switch into attacks from Pokemon such as Tapu Koko. Lanturn also switches into Electric-type attacks, has Heal Bell to heal any status Gyarados has been inflicted with, spreads Toxic poison and burns, and can bring Gyarados in safely with a slow Volt Switch. Rotom-W has similar benefits in Volt Switch and its ability to spread status. Toxapex can switch into Rock-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and set up Toxic Spikes freely against walls such as Chansey or weaker attackers to cripple everything for an easier sweep. Azumarill equipped with a Choice Band can power through walls for an easier sweep. In the same way, Mega Sharpedo can assist Gyarados with its Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch to power through the opposition, or Gyarados can do some early-game wallbreaking with Supersonic Skystrike, allowing for Mega Sharpedo to clean late-game. Choice Specs Keldeo can ruin problematic walls such as Porygon2 for Gyarados. Suicune can stall out the opposition's PP and break opposing teams with Calm Mind-boosted Scalds, clearing the way for Gyarados to clean. Choice Scarf Greninja removes huge threats such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko with Gunk Shot and outpaces and KOes faster Choice Scarf users that threaten Gyarados such as Victini and Latios. It can also provide Spikes to wear down the opposition.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ice</h1> <p>Lapras's great bulk and neutrality to Steel-type attacks lets it serve as an effective Mega Scizor check for Ice teams. Additionally, its part Water typing grants it a neutrality to Fire-type attacks, allowing it to survive a Magma Storm from Heatran and check offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Blacephalon from full health. With its ability Water Absorb and its access to Freeze-Dry, Lapras can function as a check for Water-types like Toxapex and Azumarill. When equipped with Choice Specs, Lapras is able to break past many defensive Pokemon, such as Mantine, Skarmory, and Armaldo. Unfortunately, Lapras has a terrible Speed stat, making it extremely susceptible to faster wallbreakers like Diggersby and Keldeo. Lapras also faces competition as a Mega Scizor check with Walrein, which has more Special Attack and Speed as well as Thick Fat to gain a Fire resistance. However, Lapras sets itself apart from Walrein due to its access to Freeze-Dry, allowing it to defeat bulky Water-types. Lastly, Lapras's Ice typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits the number of times it can safely switch in, while its mediocre Special Attack leaves it walled by specially defensive Pokemon like Celesteela and Alolan Muk, even with Choice Specs.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Lapras's most powerful Water-type STAB attack, capable of breaking through Fire-types like Torkoal and Heatran. Freeze-Dry is the preferred Ice-type STAB attack, as it hits Water-types like Swampert, Slowbro, and Toxapex. Hidden Power Fire is essential for hitting Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Surf is the Water-type STAB attack used for consistency and to confirm KOs when Hydro Pump's power isn't needed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack with a Modest nature and Choice Specs lets Lapras hit as hard as possible. 176 EVs in Speed are used to outspeed Azumarill and defensive Mega Scizor. The remaining EVs are put into HP to increase Lapras's overall bulk and let it survive a +4 Bullet Punch from defensive Mega Scizor from full health. Choice Specs further increases Lapras's Special Attack, turning it into a decent wallbreaker. Water Absorb grants Lapras an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to safely switch into Water-types like Toxapex and Mantine.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try sending out Lapras early-game to wallbreak against Fire-, Water-, and Steel-types. Make sure to keep Stealth Rock off the field as often as possible, since it wears down Lapras very quickly. Preserve Lapras's health so that it can take hits from Mega Scizor more effectively; for example, don't directly switch into neutral attacks from Excadrill and Heatran. Switch in Lapras against predicted Water-type attacks to restore its health. Additionally, Water Absorb can give Lapras safe switches against bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Mantine. Only use Hydro Pump when there is an important wall that Lapras needs to break through, such as Tyranitar or Mega Sableye. In most other situations, Surf's consistency is more important.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B is capable of breaking through specially defensive Pokemon that Lapras can't beat, such as Chansey and Alolan Muk, as well as being able to target Water-types that don't take much damage from Freeze-Dry like Volcanion and Empoleon. In return, Lapras can hit Water / Ground types that are immune to Fusion Bolt like Swampert and Seismitoad. Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil, allowing Lapras to survive more hits. It can also check Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion with Moonblast. Mamoswine can set up Stealth Rock to chip down foes throughout the battle to help Lapras wallbreak more easily. It can also switch into Electric-type attacks, while Lapras switches into Water-type attacks in return. Piloswine can also set up Stealth Rock, switch into Electric-type attacks, handle special attacks from Nihilego and Heatran in order to keep Lapras from taking unnecessary damage, and phaze setup sweepers such as Mew and Mega Latias with Roar. Avalugg and Rotom-F can remove entry hazards to keep Lapras healthy. Avalugg can switch into Fighting-types like Terrakion and Heracross, while Rotom-F can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Mega Scizor so Lapras can safely switch into it. Rotom-F can also slowly pivot with Volt Switch to bring in Lapras safely. Alolan Sandslash can both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Xurkitree in hail. Cloyster greatly benefits from Lapras's ability to beat Water-types that wall it, such as Toxapex and Slowbro, with Freeze-Dry. Weavile can trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini, Latios, and Gengar with Pursuit and also remove Porygon2's Eviolite with Knock Off to help Lapras break through it more easily.</p> "

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Ditto's ability Imposter allows it to transform into the foe when it is switched in, also copying all stat boosts and ignoring the Speed drop from Sticky Web. Thus, when equipped with Choice Scarf, Ditto can outpace all opposing Pokemon and Speed tie with those equipped with another Choice Scarf. Because of this, it's one of the most effective revenge killers, revenge killing setup Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade and possibly countersweeping their teams. For this reason, Ditto also discourages setup, allowing you to play passively without being too worried of opponents taking advantage of it. Ditto is also a fantastic anti-stall Pokemon, as it essentially has unlimited PP because it can just switch out to recover its PP. It can also get free recovery and act as a cleric by switching into walls such as Chansey. It can also provide hazard clearance support by switching into Defog or Rapid Spin users such as Mantine or Excadrill. Ditto is a great scouting tool, as it allows you to see all of your foe's moves. Because of this, Ditto can run the role of a revenge killer or utility Pokemon depending on what it copies. However, Ditto has trouble against bulkier Pokemon such as Calm Mind Mega Latias. Ditto is very hard to bring into setup sweepers by a direct switch, so you must almost always sacrifice a teammate in order to successfully revenge kill the threat. Ditto only has 5 PP, so it'll get PP stalled very easily and can potentially end up giving the opposition a free turn. Ditto is very predictable because it always runs one set, so your opponent can play around it especially since they know the moveset that Ditto copies as well, and Ditto's low HP stat prevents it from revenge killing some Pokemon effectively. Lastly, Ditto can turn into a huge momentum sink if the opposing Pokemon doesn't have the moves you were expecting, such as super effective attacks to beat the opposing Pokemon or utility such as Heal Bell or Defog.</p> ",

The IVs give Hidden Power Fire, allowing Ditto to effectively trap and KO opposing Magnezone.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Capitalize on Imposter by revenge killing setup Pokemon such as Salamence. Try to force Pokemon such as Dragonite into a move that locks them into it like Outrage for a guaranteed revenge KO. You can also utilize Imposter by switching into Pokemon with ability-based immunities such as Heatran and Lanturn. Ditto can switch into Pokemon that have super effective moves against the rest of their team such as Heatran on Steel and dent the opposition with correct prediction. Switching into Lanturn is also very useful, as you can get a turn to utilize Heal Bell unless they manually switch out as Ditto switches in. However, be careful to hard switch into Pokemon such as Heatran, as a misprediction can cost you your Ditto. Preserve Ditto very carefully against types with threatening setup sweepers. If you waste its potential early on by letting it get damaged or KOed it can't countersweep the opposition with a copy of a dangerous setup sweeper such as Mega Pinsir or Mega Gallade. Don't switch Ditto directly into attacks; utilize U-turn from a teammate such as Staraptor to bring it in safely. You can also make double switches to get Ditto in safely. Try to scout opposing movesets with Ditto, allowing you to play around threatening Pokemon such as Toxic Garchomp and Superpower Mega Scizor correctly. Understand that Ditto is incapable of beating Substitute Pokemon such as Suicune, so use another Pokemon such as Encore Mega Lopunny to handle them. Make sure to clear entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, against stall. This is important because without a cleric Ditto has a hard time PP stalling when it is Toxic poisoned, as it gets worn down extremely easily. When against stall teams, try to let Ditto's Choice Scarf get removed by Knock Off, in order to prevent it from being locked into moves, allowing it to PP stall more effectively, and make sure to switch out to reuse Ditto's PP infinitely. Be careful against opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Terrakion, as they can potentially win the Speed tie and KO your Ditto. Take advantage of forced switches. For example, if your Ditto switches into an opposing Dragonite by a slow U-turn or after a teammate has fainted, the opponent is forced to switch out, giving you the momentum and a free turn. Make sure to run damage calculations prior to attacking with Ditto, as Ditto doesn't copy the enemy's HP stat and itself has a very low base HP stat of 48 that doesn't let it take strong attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey provides Stealth Rock for Ditto and can wear down walls that threaten Ditto with Toxic. It also absorbs status from foes such as Mew, Gastrodon, and Zapdos that Ditto can't afford to take. Porygon2 can also spread Toxic poison and allow Ditto to more effectively revenge kill by paralyzing Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion. Staraptor can Defog entry hazards away so that Ditto can switch in more freely without being worried about the chip damage wearing it down quickly. It can also give Ditto a free switch by means of a slow U-turn. Smeargle provides hazards such as Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, softening the opposition and allowing Ditto to outpace opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon. Diggersby deals with walls that Ditto generally dislikes having to switch in on. It also chips setup Pokemon such as Quiver Dance Volcarona into range for Ditto to revenge KO. Encore Mega Lopunny can effectively beat Calm Mind users such as Clefable that threaten Ditto.</p> "

With its high Defense, Omastar can easily survive physical hits to take advantage of its ability Weak Armor, granting it +4 Speed when combined with a Shell Smash, which allows it to outspeed fast threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Latios. Unfortunately, Omastar has a terrible Special Defense stat, forcing it to rely on sand's Special Defense boost to set up against most special attackers and leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Nihilego and Gengar. After a single Shell Smash, it still ends up being outsped by common Choice Scarf Pokemon like Nihilego and Victini due to its low base 55 Speed.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shell Smash is Omastar's most important move, doubling its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed while reducing its Defense and Special Defense, allowing it to become a prominent sweeper against Ground teams. Hydro Pump is Omastar’s most powerful Water-type STAB move and is used to hit Ground-types like Hippowdon and Mamoswine. Ice Beam is good coverage for hitting Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types like Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus. Hidden Power Grass gives Omastar the ability to effectively handle Ground teams, being able to OHKO Ground-types that are immune to Hydro Pump such as Seismitoad and Gastrodon after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature is used to make Omastar as fast and strong as possible. However, a Modest nature can also be used to give Omastar extra power, allowing it to always OHKO Mega Charizard Y from full health with Hydro Pump. The ability Weak Armor lowers Omastar’s Defense while doubling its Speed whenever it's hit with a physical attack, allowing it to outspeed Excadrill under sand without the need of Sticky Web. The Air Balloon is used to make sure Omastar can safely set up against Ground-types like Excadrill and Diggersby and it doesn't get easily revenge killed by Pokemon with Ground coverage, such as Gyarados and Alolan Sandslash.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Remove or weaken Omastar's checks such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor before setting up with Omastar. For example, Omastar is best used as a late-game sweeper against Ground teams once Dugtrio's Focus Sash has been broken by Stealth Rock, and in the Steel matchup, Omastar should be used to sweep once priority users like Bisharp and Mega Scizor are defeated. Make sure to preserve Omastar's Air Balloon so that it can safely set up Shell Smash against Ground-types like Excadrill and Pokemon locked into a Ground-type move. Against Ground teams, make sure to get up Stealth Rock to break Dugtrio's Focus Sash, since it can otherwise survive a hit and revenge kill Omastar with Reversal. Keep Omastar away from status conditions such as paralysis and poison, since paralysis can make Omastar unable to outspeed common threats after Shell Smash, and poison limits the turns it has to sweep. Make sure to keep Omastar healthy, since chip damage makes it more difficult to safely set up with Shell Smash, and losing its Air Balloon takes away its ability to set up against Ground-types. It's not advised to set up against a slower Pokemon, since Omastar is at risk of taking heavy damage with its lowered defenses. In matchups such as Flying, Omastar is intended to be used more as a safe check to Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor rather than as a setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle can set up Sticky Web for Omastar, allowing it to outspeed fast revenge killers after a Shell Smash, although this isn't as effective against slower Pokemon, since Omastar finds difficulty setting up against them due to the Defense and Special Defense drops from Shell Smash. Shuckle can also use Encore on passive Pokemon to give Omastar an easier setup opportunity. Terrakion is able to break past special walls like Chansey and Mantine that can wall Omastar. In return, Omastar can beat bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Tyranitar can trap revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Latios that outspeed Omastar after a Shell Smash and can give Omastar increased Special Defense with Sand Stream for an easier setup opportunity. Mega Diancie is a powerful mixed attacker that can check Fighting-types like Keldeo and Breloom for Omastar. Alolan Golem is able to trap bulky Steel-types like Empoleon and Celesteela that Omastar can't KO in a single hit and can also trap Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, allowing Omastar to sweep Steel teams more easily. Rhyperior can check revenge killers like Choice Scarf Terrakion that outspeed Omastar after a Shell Smash, as well as Pokemon with priority attacks like Bisharp and Mega Scizor.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Mega Aerodactyl finds itself on Flying-type teams as a role compressor that can act as a fast offensive threat, a Pursuit trapper, and a Stealth Rock setter. Due to Mega Aerodactyl's great natural Speed and coverage, it offensively checks many key Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Weavile with its combination of Earthquake and Stone Edge, which can aid in difficult matchups such as Electric and Ice. Thanks to its Rock-type STAB and access to Ice Fang, Mega Aerodactyl is also one of the best offensive answers to Dragon teams, which can threaten the slow Flying teams that favor Mega Aerodactyl. Due to Mega Aerodactyl's offensive presence it forces many switches against Pokemon such as Latios and Blacephalon, which it can take advantage of with Pursuit. Mega Aerodactyl can put pressure on Defoggers like Mandibuzz and Zapdos because they are threatened by Aerodactyl's Rock-type STAB attacks. Because Mega Aerodactyl forces out many Pokemon, it gets ample opportunities to set Stealth Rock. Even though Mega Aerodactyl has a decent Attack stat, it has trouble breaking through walls such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Porygon2, which all can easily shrug off the damage Mega Aerodactyl does with their recovery moves. Mega Aerodactyl also faces competition for the coveted Mega slot by Mega Charizard Y, which is an amazing special wallbreaker with limited switch-ins that can help Flying-type teams in difficult matchups such as Steel-, Ice-, and Ground-type teams. Focus Sash Aerodactyl is a staple on hyper offense Flying teams because of its great base 130 Speed and access to utility moves like Taunt and Stealth Rock. Its Speed lets it outspeed a good portion of the metagame, making it the fastest lead entry hazard user after Deoxys-S. Additionally, its ability to stop common Stealth Rock users like Garchomp and Jirachi with Taunt is helpful, as Flying-type teams dislike Stealth Rock, and it can also stop common Defog users like Zapdos and Rotom-W from clearing its own Stealth Rock. Access to Tailwind makes it a perfect choice for offensive Flying teams, where it can provide fast offensive support to powerful wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite to beat threats like Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, and Mega Gallade. However, in its regular forme it is one-dimensional and extremely predictable to the point where Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Nihilego can easily set Stealth Rock against Aerodactyl, as it cannot block Stealth Rock with Taunt against a Choice Scarf user. Aerodactyl also faces trouble against teams with Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, as it will struggle to perform its role against them.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p>Aerodactyl can take a more offensive approach by utilizing attacking moves like Rock Slide and Earthquake over Tailwind and Double-Edge to take out Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, and Nihilego, which it normally struggles against; additionally, it can also threaten Pokemon like Zapdos, Victini, and Mandibuzz. Rock Tomb can also be used over Tailwind to slow down opposing Pokemon and help slower teammates take advantage of them, but this comes at the cost of not providing potentially a huge momentum swing for the team through Tailwind support. Taunt allows Mega Aerodactyl to prevent walls such as Mega Venusaur and Porygon2 from using recovery moves and lets it prevent Pokemon such as Nidoking and Chansey from setting Stealth Rock. However, using Taunt means that Mega Aerodactyl will have to forgo Pursuit, making Pokemon such as Victini and Choice Scarf Latios much harder to check. Wing Attack allows Mega Aerodactyl to hit Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon that would otherwise beat it such as Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Gallade. Fire Fang allows Mega Aerodactyl to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that would otherwise wall Mega Aerodactyl. Alternatively, instead of running a Mega Stone on hyper offensive teams, Aerodactyl can be used as a suicide lead with a Focus Sash. With great Speed and access to Stealth Rock and Taunt, Aerodactyl can stop many leads from setting Stealth Rock and spreading status. Double-Edge is used on such a set so that it can faint to recoil damage against Defoggers such as Zapdos rather than letting entry hazards be cleared, and Tailwind provides speed control for powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite, allowing them to outspeed foes they usually would not be able to beat such as Tapu Koko.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock limits the number of times Mega Aerodactyl can come into battle and set its own Stealth Rock against the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Burns cripple Mega Aerodactyl's ability to do any meaningful damage against foes such as Zapdos, and paralysis makes it lose its fantastic Speed tier, no longer outspeeding Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Celesteela resist Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge, allowing them to easily take its attacks and retaliate with their powerful STAB moves. Mega Scizor deserves a special mention, as it can avoid the 2HKO from Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock and threaten to set up with Swords Dance or heavily chip it with Bullet Punch. However, Steel-types such as Magnezone and Heatran that are heavily threatened by Earthquake cannot check Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Mega Aerodactyl lacks the power to OHKO most Water-type Pokemon, which can OHKO or cripple Mega Aerodactyl with their Water-type STAB attacks in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl is easily walled by bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, and Porygon2 due to their access to reliable recovery, their great natural bulk, and Mega Aerodactyl's modest damage output.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Mamoswine and Buzzwole can easily tank Mega Aerodactyl's attacks and significantly damage it in return with Icicle Crash and Ice Punch, respectively. However, Buzzwole needs to watch out for Aerial Ace, which can easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users: Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie completely shut down Aerodactyl and can reflect Stealth Rock, giving Flying teams a hard time.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users: Rapid Spin users like Armaldo and Forretress can clear Stealth Rock away simply, as Aerodactyl cannot use Taunt to stop them and has to rely on Double-Edge to prevent them from spinning.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Priority users like Scizor and Mamoswine limit the use of Aerodactyl to only one turn before it gets KOed. Mega Lopunny also beats Aerodactyl with the combination of Fake Out and High Jump Kick. Prankster Taunt users like Thundurus can also easily stop Aerodactyl from fulfilling its role.</p> <p><strong>Deoxys-S: Deoxys-S is a faster lead setter than Aerodactyl, allowing it to shut it down with Taunt and set Stealth Rock against it. Offensive Deoxys-S also beats Aerodactyl and is a greater threat to the team due to its high Speed and BoltBeam coverage.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest STAB attack, allowing it to take on threats such as Mantine, Zapdos, and Volcarona. Earthquake is a very nice coverage move that pairs well with Stone Edge and allows Mega Aerodactyl to take on Steel-types such as Magnezone that resist Stone Edge. Pursuit allows Mega Aerodactyl to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Victini, Latios, and Blacephalon that can otherwise threaten the team. Stealth Rock is a very essential move that chips the opposing team as they switch in, allowing Mega Aerodactyl and other sweepers and wallbreakers to clean through the other team more easily. Ice Fang is an option over Pursuit that allows Mega Aerodactyl to pressure Dragon teams, as Stone Edge and Ice Fang can at worst 2HKO every viable Dragon-type. If a teammate can cover the need for Stealth Rock, Mega Aerodactyl can run both Pursuit and Ice Fang, which allows Mega Aerodactyl to beat both Psychic and Dragon teams at once.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Aerodactyl to OHKO threats such as Tapu Koko with Earthquake after Stealth Rock. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Mega Aerodactyl to outspeed threats such as Weavile and Tapu Koko, allowing it to easily set up Stealth Rock. Aerodactylite allows Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve and gives it access to Tough Claws. Tough Claws directly boosts the power of Pursuit, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to more easily OHKO or severely weaken Pokemon as they switch out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Aerodactyl naturally pressures most Defog users due to its access to a powerful Rock-type STAB attack in Stone Edge, leaving many Defoggers such as Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Crobat unable to clear entry hazards very easily. It should take advantage of this by predicting Defog users threatened by it to switch in. However, Mega Aerodactyl should be careful when switching in on some Defoggers such as Zapdos and Mantine, as they threaten Mega Aerodactyl with their STAB attacks. Aerodactyl can also use its ability to pressure Defoggers with Stone Edge in order to keep Stealth Rock up constantly through the match. Due to Mega Aerodactyl's high Speed and Attack stats, it forces many switches; capitalize on this opportunity to set Stealth Rock or punish switches with Pursuit. Whenever Mega Aerodactyl switches in, Stealth Rock should ideally be removed from its side of the field so it does not have to worry about getting worn down. Mega Aerodactyl should also be used to Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Latios, Victini, and Blacephalon to prevent them from damaging the team. It can also weaken Pokemon such as Zapdos with Pursuit as they switch out, as they'll try to avoid being OHKO'ed by Stone Edge; however, Mega Aerodactyl should be careful using Pursuit when it can be threatened by the Pokemon it is trying to Pursuit trap. Mega Aerodactyl should be preserved to take care of threats such as Tapu Koko and Kyurem-B rather than attempting to set Stealth Rock at any cost. Mega Aerodactyl is fairly useless in certain matchups and should be used as a sacrifice against Ground- and Steel-type teams due to the fact that it can barely touch Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock helps support all of the offensive threats Flying teams have access to by dealing chip damage to their checks and switch-ins. Dragonite forms an excellent wallbreaking core with Mega Aerodactyl, appreciating the Stealth Rock that Mega Aerodactyl sets to help it OHKO Pokemon such as Mantine with Choice Band-boosted Outrage. Dragonite can also help Mega Aerodactyl against Steel-type Pokemon with its great coverage in Fire Punch and Superpower allowing it to take care of bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Mega Aerodactyl can then take care of Ice-type Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Life Orb Kyurem-B for Dragonite. Defog users such as Mantine, Gliscor, and Zapdos can clear entry hazards for Mega Aerodactyl. In return Mega Aerodactyl can take on Ice- and Electric-type Pokemon for them with Stone Edge and Earthquake. Both Zapdos and Mantine can also switch into special attackers for Mega Aerodactyl; Pokemon like Choice Scarf Greninja in Mantine's case, and Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu in Zapdos's case. Skarmory and Celesteela are defensive walls that can switch into Rock- and Ice-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Stone Edge and Mamoswine's Icicle Crash for Mega Aerodactyl. Both Skarmory and Celesteela appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to take on Fire-type Pokemon such as Victini. Skarmory and Celesteela also can take on Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu with their Steel-type STAB attacks for Mega Aerodactyl. Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T check Electric-types for Mega Aerodactyl. Stallbreaker Gliscor can take on Pokemon such as Chansey and Porygon2 that can give Mega Aerodactyl a fair bit of trouble due to their natural bulk. Mega Aerodactyl can then take care of Pokemon such as Victini for Gliscor by Pursuit trapping them. Gliscor also can act as a status absorber for Mega Aerodactyl. Landorus-T acts a nice Choice Scarf user that is faster than Mega Aerodactyl and can clean through weakened Electric-type teams with Earthquake. Special attackers such as Thundurus, Landorus, and Tornadus-T can help Mega Aerodactyl break through physical walls such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Swampert. In return, Mega Aerodactyl can handle Volcarona and special walls such as Alolan Muk. Gliscor, Landorus, and Landorus-T are all also capable of carrying Stealth Rock, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to run additional coverage instead.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Taunt allows Aerodactyl to stop opposing Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Alolan Golem, Ferrothorn and Heatran from setting entry hazards and stop common Defog users like Mandibuzz, Zapdos and Mantine from clearing its own Stealth Rock. Additionally, it can stop setup sweepers and defensive Pokemon like Dragonite, Volcarona, Chansey, and Celesteela. Stealth Rock allows Aerodactyl to support its teammates by wearing down opposing teams, making it easier for offensive teammates to score KOs. Double-Edge allows Aerodactyl to KO itself due to the recoil once it is knocked down to its Focus Sash or weakened, stopping Rapid Spin users like Armaldo and Forretress from clearing Stealth Rock. Tailwind lets Aerodactyl support its offensive teammates by doubling their Speed for a few turns and is a big momentum swing for the team. It works well with Double-Edge, since Aerodactyl can KO itself once Tailwind is set up, allowing a teammate to come in freely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Aerodactyl to outspeed Pokemon such as Weavile, Greninja, and Tornadus-T and Speed tie with other Pokemon with base 130 Speed like Tapu Koko and Crobat. Maximum Attack investment allows Aerodactyl to hit hard with Double-Edge so that it can faint to its recoil damage once it is down to its Focus Sash or extremely weakened. Focus Sash is used to ensure that Aerodactyl can stop opposing lead entry hazard setters with Taunt and set up Stealth Rock or Tailwind before fainting. Its ability Unnerve, though situational, helps against Berry users like Azumarill and Alolan Muk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Aerodactyl should be used as a lead most of the time due to its higher Speed than most other entry hazard setters. Leading with it most of the time also ensures that it gets most out of its Focus Sash, which allows it to stop opposing entry hazard and Defog users with Taunt or set up Tailwind to secure momentum for the team depending upon the situation. However, against teams with Magic Bounce users like Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, it is not advisable to lead with Aerodactyl, as it fails to do anything meaningful against such Pokemon. Instead, teammates like Mega Charizard Y and Choice Scarf Landorus-T should be used to threaten and force out the aforementioned Magic Bounce users. Similarly, Aerodactyl should not be used as a lead against faster entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S and Mega Aerodactyl, as they are too fast to afflict with Taunt, so it should instead wait until such Pokemon are taken care of by a teammate. Against types like Poison, Normal, and Water, Aerodactyl should prioritize setting up Stealth Rock, as it gives its teammates an easier time scoring KOs. Against types like Steel and Ground, Aerodactyl should focus more on setting up Tailwind, as this gives teammates like Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus-T a good chance to break through the opposing team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The combination of Aerodactyl's Speed and access to Taunt allows it to deny Stealth Rock for its teammates like Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus-T, Dragonite, and Togekiss. This makes its teammates harder to wear down and revenge kill for the opposing team. Offensive powerhouses like Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite are great partners for Aerodactyl to break through opposing teams more easily. Tailwind support also allows them to put a lot of pressure against Steel, Electric, and Psychic teams. Setup sweepers like Hawlucha also pair well with Aerodactyl, as it can set up and clean weakened teams and does great against Steel, Dark, and Normal teams. Defensive Celesteela is a premier utility Pokemon for Flying teams and does a wonderful job at breaking down defensive cores with Toxic + Leech Seed while also acting as a switch-in to Ice-type moves for the team from the likes of Mamoswine and Greninja. Landorus-T can utilize a Double Dance set to wallbreak and clean or use a Choice Scarf set to better deal with threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie for the team. Similarly, Choice Scarf Togekiss can be used to deal with Dragon-type threats like Kyurem-B and Kommo-o. Landorus-T and Togekiss can act as emergency Defog user for the team, too. Thundurus-T pairs amazingly well with Aerodactyl, as it can pick up KOs easily with its Double Dance or Agility + 3 Attacks set against Water and Flying teams. Furthermore, it provides the team with an additional immunity to Electric-type attacks.</p> "

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Curse Snorlax performs the role of a bulky setup sweeper and a late-game sweeper for Normal-type teams against types such as Fairy and Electric. It is able to take on threatening attackers such as Mega Gallade and Keldeo after a single Curse boost and can be hard to stop once it has sufficient boosts. Its high special bulk lets it handle special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Latios and find opportunities to set up. Gluttony + Recycle allows Snorlax to use a reliable way of recovery without draining much momentum. However, Snorlax's low Defense makes it easily beaten by strong physical attackers such as Dragonite and Tapu Bulu if it does not have sufficient Curse boosts. Its reliance on Curse boosts to act as a sweeper also makes it susceptible to Taunt users such as Gliscor, Heatran, and Mew. Another downside to Snorlax is its inability to cure status conditions. Toxic in particular completely shuts it down.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Earthquake is an option over Fire Punch to hit Rock- and Electric-types such as Terrakion and Zeraora better, but using Earthquake makes Snorlax susceptible to Steel-types that don't mind it like Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela. Snorlax can utilize a Rest and Sleep Talk set with Leftovers to set up Curse boosts without getting crippled by moves such as Toxic and Knock Off, but using a RestTalk set makes Snorlax forgo coverage to hit Steel-type Pokemon.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Dragonite, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Zeraora can break Snorlax relatively easily if it does not has sufficient Curse boosts.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Curse allows Snorlax to patch up its lackluster Defense stat and tank Secret Sword from Choice Specs Keldeo much better. The Attack increase also enables Snorlax to be a potent sweeper against types like Fairy. Recycle allows Snorlax to reuse its Iapapa Berry and acts as a form of recovery, allowing Snorlax to not get worn out in the battle. Facade allows Snorlax to take advantage of burns and paralysis by dealing good damage to defensive status inducers like Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W and Scald Swampert. Fire Punch lets Snorlax deal good damage to Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>228 HP investment along with maximum Defense investment allows Snorlax to take on powerful attackers such as Keldeo and Mega Gallade much better after a single Curse boost. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense along with a Careful nature to allow it to take on powerful special attackers such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko. Gluttony allows Snorlax to consume its pinch Berry at 50% HP or less, which is important for keeping it healthy without losing momentum.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is best to utilize Snorlax late-game when its checks, such as strong wallbreakers like Calm Mind Keldeo and Mega Gallade and phazers such as Hippowdon and Mantine, are taken out by its teammates. Snorlax should be wary of potential Toxic users such as Zapdos and Toxapex; scout the sets before attempting to set up Curse. However, Snorlax can act as a burn or paralysis absorber for the team, powering up Facade, and it can even get itself burned by switching into move such as Scald so that it won't be crippled by Toxic. Knock Off users such as Bisharp, Alolan Muk, and Azumarill should be avoided at all costs. Common Taunt users such as Mew, Gliscor, and Heatran can stop Snorlax from setting up and using its recovery move, so they need to be checked before Snorlax can set up safely. Snorlax should find opportunities to set up Curse against special attackers that it can handle such as Nidoking and Hydreigon. When setting up Curse, Recycle should be used to keep Snorlax healthy and gauge the damage dealt by opposing Pokemon; keeping Snorlax in a healthy HP range helps to find more opportunities to set up Curse.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Pidgeot is a great teammate for Snorlax, as it can not only break down and pressure Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Scizor but also beat Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Breloom, and Keldeo as well as provide Defog support. Defensive Intimidate Staraptor can take on strong physical attackers such as Mega Gallade and provide pivoting with U-turn. It checks Fighting-type Pokemon thanks to STAB Brave Bird and provides Snorlax with Defog utility. Chansey can provide Stealth Rock support, which will allow Snorlax to weaken Pokemon that can check it such as Choice Band Dragonite. Additionally, Chansey can use its Natural Cure to sponge crippling status moves such as Toxic for Snorlax. Chansey also checks powerful special wallbreakers that Snorlax cannot handle such as Landorus. Swords Dance or Choice Band Diggersby can weaken the opponent's defensive core; the former in particular can pave the way for Snorlax to set up Curse, as it effectively beats out common defensive Pokemon that may be a hindrance to Snorlax such as Mantine, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur. Similarly, Mega Lopunny can break down shared checks with Snorlax and act as a Knock Off sponge. It also breaks down Steel-type teams due to STAB High Jump Kick. By using a Power-Up Punch + Encore set, Mega Lopunny can beat defensive Pokemon that can check Snorlax such as Toxapex. Due to a diverse movepool, Porygon2 can provide utility support to Snorlax by weakening walls such as Swampert with Toxic, beating stallbreakers like Gliscor with Ice Beam, and pressuring Pokemon such as Mantine and Celesteela with Discharge. It can also punish setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor by using Foul Play. Ditto deters setup sweepers that pose a threat to Snorlax such as Gyarados and Mega Gallade and it acts as a revenge killer by countersweeping Pokemon that try to setup. Porygon-Z is a decent teammate that can blast through defensive threats to Snorlax like Gliscor and Celesteela due to its BoltBeam coverage.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Zapdos's decent bulk and Flying typing allow it to function as one of the best defensive Pokemon available to Electric. Its part Flying typing grants Zapdos a very important immunity to Ground, allowing it to freely switch into Ground-type attacks for the team. Its bulk and good defensive typing enable Zapdos to switch into a plethora of attackers such as Scizor and Excadrill. Zapdos's access to Defog allows it to function as the premier hazard remover for Electric teams, and Roost grants it longevity throughout a battle. Zapdos also commonly utilizes Heat Wave, allowing it to take on troublesome Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, which otherwise walls the majority of most Electric teams. It is able to provide paralysis support for its teammates through its ability Static as well as with Discharge. Zapdos is also able to function as a pivot for its teammates with Volt Switch in order to safely bring in teammates against faster foes. Even though its Flying typing grants it an immunity to Ground, it also provides weaknesses to Ice and Rock, both of which are very prevalent coverage options in the metagame, leaving it threatened by Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Zapdos finds itself as one of the most useful Pokemon a Flying-type team can use, as its Electric typing allows it to take attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko under Electric Terrain, and it is able to provide support for its team via Defog. Its bulk also allows it to take hits from opposing offensive Pokemon such as Gengar and Latios. With Pressure as its ability, Zapdos is able to waste opposing Stealth Rock PP quickly and successfully stall out Pokemon that use the move repeatedly, as well as waste the PP of other opposing moves that threaten its teammates. Zapdos's access to Roost and Toxic allows it to be an effective user of Pressure stall and force out opposing walls and offensive Pokemon with ease; alternatively, it can also use Defog to become a fast specially defensive pivot able to outspeed the likes of Heatran and Diggersby. Zapdos can work effectively as a pivot as well thanks to its access to Volt Switch, which allows it to make a good pivoting core with teammates like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T. Zapdos effectively spreads status to the opposing team with Discharge and Toxic, allowing it to become a useful asset in wearing down opposing Pokemon for its teammates. However, because of this passive playstyle, Zapdos is susceptible to Taunt, which can be problematic if it is trying to Defog hazards, heal itself with Roost, or wear down a threat with Toxic. Also, despite being a great wall, Zapdos can still be KOed by a lot of physical attackers like Mega Aerodactyl due to its slightly lackluster offensive presence and lack of physical bulk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>A Substitute + Toxic set could be used along with Defog Rotom-W in order to more readily deal with defensive Pokemon looking to wall Zapdos, notably helping in the Normal matchup. However, this set makes the Steel matchup notably harder, as Zapdos loses out on its Heat Wave. A specially defensive set of 252 HP / 176 SpD / 80 Spe with a Calm nature could be used to act as a special wall, notably being able to take on special attackers such as Choice Scarf Latios and Gengar while outspeeding Adamant Diggersby. However, Zapdos loses out on the ability to check physical attackers as readily and is slower than several key Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice can be run in order to hit Dragon- and Ground-types that take little damage from Zapdos such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Landorus.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Zapdos can use alternative spreads to deal with certain threats better or to maximize its bulk while outspeeding other important key threats. Zapdos's SubToxic set, for example, can run maximum Speed and HP to outspeed Kyurem-B and deplete its Fusion Bolt or Ice Beam PP. This, however, sacrifices Zapdos's longevity and bulk against other offensive Pokemon and makes it harder to switch into many Pokemon. Zapdos can also run a spread of 252 HP / 148 SpD / 108 Spe on the Defog set for increased survivability while still being able to outpace the likes of Jolly Bisharp and Jolly Breloom.

In return it threatens to wear Zapdos down with Leech Seed as well as poison from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic poison wears down Zapdos throughout the battle, preventing it from removing entry hazards continuously or absorbing special attacks.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Kommo-o can use Taunt to stop Zapdos's recovery and ability to Defog, which makes it a sitting duck for any incoming damage from the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Walls: Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Chansey, and Heatran all take very little damage from Zapdos. However, other walls such as Swampert, Celesteela, and Clefable are threatened by the SubToxic set.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Setup Sweepers: Pokemon like Mega Gallade, Choice Specs Blacephalon, Refresh Mega Latias, and Refresh Mega Altaria can break through Zapdos's defenses and eventually KO it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Like most Flying-types, Zapdos is weak to Rock- and Ice-type attacks, especially physical variants due to its underwhelming physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Zapdos gets completely shut down by Toxic, since it relies on being healthy. Getting burned does not help either, as the negation of Leftovers makes it harder to wall opposing Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Zapdos is setup fodder for certain sweepers depending on what moves it runs. Zapdos without Toxic is a free turn of setup for Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, while lacking Heat Wave will allow both Mega Scizor and Bisharp to Swords Dance on it safely.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch grants Zapdos a means of pivoting so that it can slowly bring in its teammates safely. Discharge is an option over Volt Switch, most notably threatening foes with a 30% paralysis chance while keeping Zapdos in the field as opposed to forcing it to pivot out. Defog removes entry hazards from the field that would otherwise interrupt the momentum of Electric teams by slowly chipping them down. Roost grants Zapdos a means of reliable recovery, lengthening its presence throughout a battle and allowing it to absorb weak attacks more readily. Heat Wave is important coverage for Zapdos, most notably hitting Steel-types that it otherwise cannot threaten such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>80 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature allow Zapdos to outspeed Jolly Diggersby as well as Pokemon like Heatran and Tapu Bulu. The remainder of its EVs are placed into HP and Defense to maximize its ability to absorb physical attacks, notably surviving Diggersby's Return, Tapu Bulu's Stone Edge, and Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm and walling Choice Scarf Excadrill's Rock Slide. Leftovers is used to grant Zapdos more sustainability throughout a battle. Static gives Zapdos a passive 30% chance to paralyze foes that make contact with it. Pressure could be used in place of Static in order to stall out the PP of weak attackers in conjunction with its bulk and recovery. It also can notably stall out Stealth Rock users' PP when combined with Defog.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Zapdos into common hazard setters that do not threaten it such as Torkoal, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn in order to immediately remove hazards from the field as they set them. Utilize Zapdos's great bulk in order to take on threatening attackers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Diggersby as well as physical attackers that lack coverage to damage Zapdos such as Scizor and Mega Pinsir. Make the most of Zapdos's immunity to Ground by switching in on predicted Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Landorus and Excadrill. However, be careful of Pokemon that may predict this switch and utilize a Rock-type move such as Rock Slide from Choice Band Excadrill, which will deal a huge blow to Zapdos. Try to preserve Zapdos's HP as much as possible throughout the battle with Roost to continuously remove hazards from the field and switch into attacks. If using Discharge, use it freely for the chip damage and for the chance to paralyze foes, which neutralizes their Speed for teammates to better handle them. When using Volt Switch, utilize it to keep momentum up against the opposing team by pivoting out on predicting bulky switch-ins such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur in order to bring in a teammate that can effectively deal with them. Additionally, utilize Volt Switch against faster foes in order to safely bring in teammates such as Alolan Raichu and Thundurus. However, be wary of using Volt Switch when Zapdos is at low health, as it will be unable to switch into attackers if its HP isn't maintained. Avoid Toxic users such as Swampert and Cradily as much as possible, as Toxic hampers Zapdos's ability to continuously absorb attacks throughout the battle and puts Zapdos on a timer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu are great offensive Pokemon that help keep faster foes in check and pair well with Zapdos, as they appreciate a defensive backbone to fall back onto as well as Zapdos's Ground immunity. Rotom-W pairs amazingly defensively with Zapdos, completing a decent defensive backbone for the team. It also provides Will-O-Wisp support to nullify physical attackers, which allows Zapdos to even more readily take them on. Alolan Golem is the only viable entry hazard setter for Electric teams and can help take on Ice-types for Zapdos with its STAB Rock-type attacks. It also helps Zapdos by taking on specially defensive Pokemon that Zapdos cannot touch such as Chansey. Thundurus is another physical attacker that can take on Normal-, Ice-, and Rock-types for Zapdos such as Chansey, Mamoswine, and Mega Diancie. Magnezone is a powerful special attacker that can take notably take on Mega Venusaur for Zapdos as well as trap Steel-types such as Excadrill. Zeraora is a powerful physical attacker for Electric that can effectively remove Pokemon that Zapdos otherwise cannot handle such as Chansey and Porygon2 and greatly appreciates Zapdos's slow pivoting to safely bring it in. Mega Manectric is a great offensive pivot that appreciates being able to switch out to Zapdos following a Volt Switch. It also provides Intimidate support, granting Zapdos more opportunities to come in, even against physical attackers. Xurkitree is yet another special attacker that can notably take on Electric-immune Pokemon such as Swampert and Gastrodon that Zapdos cannot touch with its Energy Ball.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute allows Zapdos to avoid status while also being able to stall almost any Pokemon down in tandem with Toxic and Roost. Toxic is used to beat opposing walls like Porygon2 and put offensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B on a timer. It also wears down most Ground-types that are immune to Discharge. Discharge is primarily used as a STAB move that can paralyze opposing Pokemon, making it harder for them to KO Zapdos. It also hits most Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that are immune to Toxic. Roost is used to keep Zapdos healthy, especially after using a couple of Substitutes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>136 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used to creep maximum Speed Heatran and avoid its fast Toxic, as well as to outpace Suicune and Nidoking. Maximum HP investment with the remaining EVs put into Special Defense allows Zapdos to maximize the health of its Substitute and its own bulk. Pressure is used to further deplete the PP of threatening moves like Magma Storm, Stone Edge, and Sludge Bomb, and Toxic is used so that Zapdos can force the users of these moves out. Leftovers allows Zapdos to passively recover health behind its Substitute without being forced to use Roost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Take advantage of passive Pokemon like Mega Sableye to easily set up Substitute and stall them out. Use Toxic liberally throughout the battle to spread status early-game. This allows Zapdos to stall more later in the game, taking pressure off the rest of the team. Zapdos should avoid getting poisoned or burned, as it will make it immensely difficult for it to properly wall opposing Pokemon. Avoid getting hit by Knock Off, as losing its Leftovers makes it harder for this set to be effective. Take advantage of Discharge's paralysis chance to provide some speed control against Pokemon like Greninja. However, be wary of accidentally paralyzing a wall like Porygon2 or Cradily, as this will make them harder for your team to take down. Try to use Substitute when the opposing Pokemon is badly poisoned or if you expect a Z-Move from a Pokemon that is slower than Zapdos, such as Tapu Bulu or Heatran.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mantine is a great Defogger that can take Ice-type attacks for Zapdos while also being able to check threats to Zapdos like Choice Scarf Greninja. Its Haze also helps Zapdos immensely with setup sweepers like Azumarill. Celesteela also helps check Zapdos's threats thanks to its amazing typing, allowing it to take many Rock- and Ice-type attacks Zapdos is weak to, while its Flamethrower can help get rid of opposing Steel-types like Ferrothorn that make it difficult for Zapdos to be effective. Skarmory helps take physical attacks that Zapdos is usually vulnerable to, can use Defog to remove Stealth Rock and prevent it from harming Zapdos, and has Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers that would take advantage of Zapdos. Mega Aerodactyl is a fantastic assistant for Zapdos, as it can KO opposing Rock- and Ice-types with Earthquake and Stone Edge. It also provides Stealth Rock support and Pursuit traps threats to Zapdos like Victini. Landorus-T and Gliscor are both good Electric-immune teammates that can still assist Zapdos. Choice Scarf Landorus-T also acts as a good pivot with U-turn and is a reliable way to keep faster foes in check, while Gliscor helps stallbreak opposing teams with its good bulk, high passive recovery, pseudo status immunity, and Taunt. Tornadus-T is an excellent pivot with its Speed and access to U-turn, and is also an excellent offensive Defogger that can KO opposing Steel-types with Heat Wave and remove opposing items with Knock Off.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is used so that Zapdos can pivot out of the fight to keep momentum going. Roost allows Zapdos to recover its health and allows it to continue to be useful in the match. Defog removes entry hazards from the field, easing the need for the move on other teammates so they can run other moves. Heat Wave hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill to keep them from walling Zapdos. Discharge can be used over Volt Switch so that Zapdos has a reliable STAB move that also has a decent paralysis chance. Toxic can be used over Heat Wave to hit incoming walls and checks to Zapdos like Porygon2 and Landorus-T, putting them on a timer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment, 176 Special Defense EVs, and a Calm nature allow Zapdos to be as bulky as possible and survive a multitude of hits from offensive Pokemon like Gengar and Latios. Zapdos runs 80 Speed EVs to make sure that it outspeeds Adamant Bisharp and Adamant Diggersby. Leftovers is used to give Zapdos as much passive recovery as possible. Pressure is Zapdos's best ability, as it allows it to deplete the PP of opposing sweepers that it walls, limiting their choices and forcing switches.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volt Switch should be used once Zapdos has successfully removed Stealth Rock from the field so its teammates can come in safely. Using it against faster Pokemon allows Zapdos to bring in teammates like Mega Aerodactyl and Landorus-T safely, while using it against slower Pokemon allows it to safely pivot out to a wall like Mantine or Gliscor so they can completely stop the foe. Try to avoid having Zapdos getting its passive recovery nullified, as losing its Leftovers to Knock Off or getting hit with a status move makes it harder for Zapdos to effectively wall opposing Pokemon. Try to switch Zapdos in on a predicted Stealth Rock use, as it makes it easier to deplete the opposing Pokemon's PP for that move, allowing your team to be able to switch into the fight more easily. Make sure that Zapdos is healthy before it switches out, as it will make it easier for it to Defog effectively later in the match. Zapdos can provide speed control by spreading paralysis with Discharge, which can be really useful to keep revenge killers like Kommo-o in check. Zapdos should use Toxic on a predicted switch to a wall or an Electric-immune Pokemon so that it can put them on a timer and give its team the upper hand. Try to bluff Toxic against balance teams that are vulnerable to it like Normal so that you can surprise would-be switch-ins. Heat Wave is also important to keep hidden so you can surprise switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Bisharp in the Steel matchup, allowing you to get the upper hand in the fight.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The entire team appreciates Zapdos's ability to remove Stealth Rock effectively, as most Flying-types are weak to it. Its teammates also appreciate its neutrality to Electric-type moves. Celesteela can wear down opposing Pokemon with Toxic and Leech Seed, and Leech Seed in particular can provide Zapdos with additional healing, allowing it to force out even more Pokemon. It also has a spectacular typing and great bulk that allow it to take Ice-type attacks for Zapdos as well. Mantine is an excellent switch-in to Pokemon like Greninja and can form a great defensive Defog core with Zapdos. Its Haze also allows it to make setup sweepers less of a problem for Zapdos. Landorus-T can utilize Choice Scarf to remove threats to Zapdos with its powerful Earthquake, such as Nidoking and Terrakion. Tornadus-T is a great assisting Defogger that helps take down checks to Zapdos like Mega Venusaur with Hurricane. It also forms a nice pivoting core with Zapdos and appreciates Zapdos's ability to get rid of certain Steel-types that it struggles against, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Mega Aerodactyl appreciates Zapdos's ability to wear down opposing walls and attackers so that it can clean opposing teams more easily. In return, it can remove threats such as Taunt Tapu Koko and Trick Latios so Zapdos isn't crippled or removed. Skarmory can switch into physical attacks from Pokemon like Excadrill and Mega Gallade, as well as neutralize physical Rock-type attacks. Mega Charizard Y can break down the walls that Zapdos struggles against like Ferrothorn, making it easier for Zapdos to wear down opposing offensive Pokemon.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Dragonite is the most powerful physical wallbreaker available to Dragon thanks to its high Attack and great coverage options. It's able to survive nearly any unboosted attack from full health thanks to its ability Multiscale and decent bulk, allowing it to function as a great blanket check to many Pokemon. Dragonite's movepool is very wide and can be customized to take on Pokemon that threaten the team, notably helping immensely against Steel and Normal. Dragonite's access to Extreme Speed allows it to easily revenge kill weakened threats such as Greninja without fear of breaking its Multiscale. However, its typing does not offer anything unique to Dragon defensively while also compounding its weakness to Ice and carrying a notable weakness to Rock. Furthermore, Dragonite's need to be at full HP to utilize Multiscale and check key threats such as Mega Diancie puts pressure on it to avoid status and on its teammates to keep Stealth Rock off of the field throughout the battle. Additionally, Dragonite has limited opportunities to come onto the field, as switching into attacks risks breaking Multiscale. Dragonite's mediocre Speed allows it to be easily taken advantage of after revenge killing a foe. Its four moves are easily exploitable, as common Pokemon resist or are immune to all of them and they can be checked by many defensive threats.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Dragonite's high Attack and good movepool make it a good physical wallbreaker for Flying teams able to use its STAB Outrage to punch holes in defensive and offensive types alike, such as Water and Electric. Multiscale along with good bulk gives it ample opportunities to switch into passive threats provided Stealth Rock is off the field and fire off a strong attack or set up a sweep with Dragon Dance. Extreme Speed makes Dragonite an effective revenge killer, being able to pick off weakened threats such as Volcarona and Alolan Raichu. Dragonite's Dragon typing also gives several useful resistances, letting it check threats such as Calm Mind Keldeo and Zeraora. However, Dragonite is susceptible to chip damage such as status and Stealth Rock, breaking its Multiscale, making it unable to tank hits as effectively. Dragonite also is reliant on Extreme Speed to deal with many faster threats due to its mediocre Speed and 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, which lets Pokemon that carry them such as Mamoswine or Porygon2 threaten it even with Multiscale.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Dragon Dance along with a Lum Berry can let Dragonite function as a sweeper, as its ability nearly guarantees it gets at least one boost, with Lum Berry preventing status once; however, Dragonite appreciates the immediate power Choice Band provides as well as the additional coverage.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Lum Berry can be utilized on the Dragon Dance set if another teammate is using a Z-Crystal, allowing Dragonite to avoid crippling status once and let it set up without risk on Scald users like Mantine. However, the lack of Devastating Drake means it fails to OHKO bulky walls such as Toxapex without multiple boosts. Fire Punch can be used over Earthquake on the Dragon Dance set to hit many Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor for super effective damage. However, its lower Base Power compared to Earthquake makes it fairly weak and reliant on Dragon Dance boosts to break past its intended targets.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Dragonite's glaring 4x weakness to Ice-type moves leaves it easily threatened by Ice-types such as Mamoswine as well as Pokemon carrying Ice-type coverage such as Greninja and Porygon-Z. Kyurem-B is a very significant threat due to its Teravolt negating Multiscale, allowing it to easily outspeed and KO Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Tapu Koko on Electric and Azumarill on Water prevent Dragonite from using Outrage throughout the battle. This forces Dragonite to make accurate predictions with its other coverage moves in order to handle them.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Extremely physically bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro are able to absorb attacks from Dragonite and heal any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Dragonite relies on Multiscale to absorb attacks from its foes. Stealth Rock prevents this by chipping Dragonite down as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn neutralizes Dragonite's functionality as a wallbreaker, while poison slowly whittles down Dragonite throughout the battle; both status effects negate Multiscale as well. Paralysis hampers Dragonite's ability to effectively threaten opposing Pokemon, as it is then easily outsped by the majority of the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Common Protect users such as Mega Sableye and Baneful Bunker Toxapex are able to scout whichever move Dragonite locks itself into and then switch to a teammate that can effectively deal with the chosen move.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Weavile can easily KO Dragonite even through Multiscale with their 4x super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types like Azumarill and Tapu Koko are immune to Dragonite's strongest attack in Outrage and can safely switch into it to disrupt its wallbreaking attempts.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-B</strong>: Kyurem-B can easily OHKO Dragonite with no Dragon Dance boosts using Ice Beam due to Teravolt bypassing Multiscale, and it can also KO any potential switch-in on Flying teams with its BoltBeam coverage.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock deals a large chunk of damage to Dragonite upon it switching in and also removes its Multiscale, making it unable to take hits as easily.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and burn can remove Dragonite's Multiscale, with the latter in particular crippling Dragonite completely by halving its Attack. Paralysis also inhibits it by making it unable to outspeed and break through certain walls like Mega Venusaur.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is a very powerful STAB attack, allowing Dragonite to break past defensive Pokemon such as Swampert and Gliscor. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill or check weakened faster Pokemon such as Victini and Latios. Fire Punch provides important coverage for Steel-types that resist Extreme Speed and Outrage, such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Scizor. Superpower allows Dragonite to deal with otherwise insurmountable Normal-types such as Porygon2 while also being effective against Steel-types like Heatran. Earthquake is an option over Superpower to deal with foes such as Toxapex and Alolan Muk without having to lock into Outrage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature and Choice Band combine to make Dragonite a powerful wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment allows Dragonite to outspeed virtually all defensive Pokemon as well as slower offensive Pokemon such as Adamant Diggersby and Mega Scizor. Multiscale allows Dragonite to safely revenge kill most foes, even if they're faster, without fear of being OHKOed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Utilize Dragonite's power and coverage to break past defensive cores and force switches throughout the battle. Be sure to use Extreme Speed to take on weakened faster foes such as Greninja and priority users such as Mamoswine. Do not use Outrage too early in a battle, as the opponent can take advantage of Dragonite by switching to common Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Azumarill in order to gain a free turn. Take advantage of Multiscale, in order to effectively check foes such as Tapu Koko and Mega Sharpedo. In a given matchup, determine whether Dragonite needs to be preserved to deal with a key threat such as Greninja or Mega Diancie. If this is not the case, it can be used more liberally to punch holes. Be sure to keep Stealth Rock off the field before bringing in Dragonite, as it relies heavily on Multiscale to tank attacks. In that same notion, avoid switching Dragonite into any attack unless completely necessary. Be wary of status, as burn inhibits its ability to function as a wallbreaker, passive damage nullifies Multiscale, and paralysis allows even defensive Pokemon to outspeed Dragonite.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As a powerful wallbreaker with strong priority, Dragonite helps its teammates with its ability to weaken common walls while also serving as a blanket check to dangerous offensive threats. Garchomp provides very beneficial Stealth Rock support that allows Dragonite to more easily OHKO Pokemon late-game. Latios and Latias are extremely important teammates, as they're great revenge killers and can provide Defog support, which removes troublesome Stealth Rock. Latias also can provide Healing Wish for Dragonite, granting it an additional chance to take advantage of Multiscale. Kyurem-B is a powerful mixed attacker that pairs well with Dragonite, as their combined coverage is able to break past the majority of foes, most notably taking on Water and Flying teams. Dragonite also appreciates Kyurem-B's ability to take on Ice-types thanks to its Ice neutrality. Hydreigon is a great special wallbreaker that pairs effectively with Dragonite, as it is able to take on physical walls that Dragonite cannot easily deal with such as Skarmory and Toxapex. Mega Latias is an amazing defensive setup sweeper with Calm Mind and Stored Power that appreciates Dragonite's ability to remove special walls such as Chansey. Mega Altaria and Kommo-o are great setup sweepers and pair well with Dragonite, as Dragonite is able to weaken common Pokemon that wall them such as Porygon2 and Mandibuzz, respectively.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band (Flying)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is Dragonite's strongest STAB move and is able to 2HKO many physical walls like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. However, Dragonite can potentially be revenge killed if it's locked into it and left unable to switch out of a threat such as Kyurem-B or Nihilego. Extreme Speed is a powerful priority move that can 2HKO fast threats like Zeraora and Volcarona. Fire Punch hits common Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Klefki, and Mega Scizor that resist Outrage, as well as catching Tapu Bulu. Superpower is able to OHKO Air Balloon Heatran as well as always 2HKO Porygon2 on the switch, both of which can otherwise serve as roadblocks for Dragonite. Earthquake is an alternate option that can OHKO certain Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie, avoid poison from Baneful Bunker Toxapex, and still hit non-Air Balloon Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Dragonite hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs put Dragonite above key threats such as Adamant Diggersby and Adamant Bisharp. Choice Band boosts the power of Dragonite's attacks to monstrous levels, letting it effectively break past defensive teams, at the cost of locking it into one move. Multiscale lets Dragonite take half damage from an attack when at full HP, letting it survive strong hits it otherwise wouldn't, such as Mega Diancie's Diamond Storm or Moonblast.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragonite is best used to break past defensive walls such as Zapdos with Choice Band-boosted Outrage. Dragonite's Multiscale can be preserved by bringing it in with a U-turn user such as Tornadus-T or Landorus-T or on a predicted double switch. If your opponent has a Steel-type like Celesteela or Heatran that resists Outrage, try to predict them switching it into Dragonite and hit it with a super effective coverage move like Fire Punch or Superpower. Preserving Dragonite late-game can be worth it so it can use Extreme Speed to revenge kill fast but frail threats like Greninja and Alolan Raichu that otherwise could sweep the team. Extreme Speed can also be utilized late-game to clean up weakened teams. Multiscale can be used to let Dragonite act as an emergency check to setup sweepers like Double Dance Mew if Stealth Rock is not on the field and its teammates are unable to handle it otherwise. It is important to keep Stealth Rock off the field with a teammate's Defog or Taunt so Dragonite's Multiscale won't be broken upon switching in. Dragonite should avoid status whenever possible, as poison and burn breaks its Multiscale, with the latter also completely crippling it by halving its Attack, while paralysis makes it unable to outspeed and 2HKO walls like Mega Venusaur. It is important to preserve Dragonite in the Electric matchup, as it can break past the Rotom-W + Zapdos defensive core while also OHKOing Alolan Raichu with Choice Band- boosted Extreme Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive pivots like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Tornadus-T make for excellent partners, as they can remove Stealth Rock with Defog and bring Dragonite in safely with U-turn. Dragonite can then break past bulky walls like Mantine and Mega Sableye that tend to switch into its teammates. Landorus-T and Tornadus-T also can utilize Knock Off so Dragonite has an easier time dealing with potential checks like Swampert and Porygon2. Mantine can remove Stealth Rock with Defog for Dragonite and switch into Ice-type attacks from the likes of Greninja. In exchange, Dragonite can pressure stallbreakers like Calm Mind Keldeo and Zapdos, which Mantine struggles to do anything against. Celesteela can take on Ice- and Rock-types like Mamoswine and Terrakion for Dragonite while also being able to keep Dragonite's Multiscale from being broken by weak attacks such as Scald with Leech Seed. Gliscor can absorb status that otherwise cripples Dragonite, reliably remove Stealth Rock with Defog, and use Taunt to relieve pressure from Dragonite to deal with bulky walls, helping in particular against Steel-type teams, which Dragonite can struggle with due to Protect scouting from Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Zapdos can relieve pressure from Dragonite in dealing with Electric-types such as Zap Plate Tapu Koko. It also can run a Substitute + Toxic set to take advantage of Dragonite checks such as Baneful Bunker Toxapex and Azumarill or alternatively support it with Volt Switch or Defog. Mega Charizard Y makes for a good offensive partner due to it immensely threatening Steel-types that can impede Dragonite, such as Skarmory. In exchange, Dragonite can easily break past specially defensive walls like Chansey, Mantine, and Toxapex that Mega Charizard Y struggles with. Mega Aerodactyl can set Stealth Rock and Pursuit trap threats such as Latios for Dragonite, while Dragonite can break past physically defensive walls like Mega Venusaur. Landorus is a powerful special wallbreaker that appreciates Dragonite's ability to break special walls like Chansey and Gliscor, while it can pressure Steel-types like Jirachi in exchange.</p> "

Extreme Speed provides strong priority for threats that can still outspeed +2 Dragonite such as Choice Scarf Greninja.

Dragonium Z powers up Outrage into Devastating Drake, blowing past walls such as Toxapex after a Dragon Dance boost. Multiscale lets Dragonite take strong hits from full health such as Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge so that it can act as an emergency revenge killer or have more opportunities to set up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance is best utilized on offensive Flying teams to compress the roles of a sweeper, wallbreaker, and emergency check to setup sweepers with Multiscale. Dragon Dance is ideally set up on a Pokemon that is unable to OHKO Dragonite with Multiscale intact, either early-game to wallbreak or late-game to sweep a weakened team. Dragonite can also bluff a Choice Band set and take advantage of the forced switch to set up a free Dragon Dance. It is very important to keep Stealth Rock off the field to preserve Multiscale, as without it Dragonite finds far fewer setup opportunities. Dragonite's Z-Move can be used without a Dragon Dance boost to OHKO a threat such as SubToxic Zapdos or Double Dance Mew in a pinch. Keep in mind that Dragonite's low Speed tier means very fast Pokemon such as Tapu Koko along with most Choice Scarf users manage to outspeed Dragonite at +1. Some Choice Scarf users such as Nihilego, Greninja, and Terrakion even outspeed it after two speed boosts. Dragonite should avoid any status conditions, as being afflicted with them will hamper or completely shut down its ability to sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl and Imprison Landorus-T make for good suicide leads to both sets and prevent Stealth Rock early-game while being able to bring Dragonite in safely via Double-Edge recoil or Explosion. Autotomize + Metronome Celesteela is a fantastic offensive teammate, with Dragonite being able to beat Toxapex and Chansey, while Celesteela can deal with Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Azumarill that Dragonite struggles with. They also have great defensive synergy, with them resisting or taking neutral damage from all of each other's type weaknesses. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T or Thundurus-T can support Dragonite with Defog and bring it in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch, while also providing a high Speed tier so Dragonite's Extreme Speed isn't the team's only answer to fast threats like Mega Lopunny. Mega Charizard Y is able to immensely pressure Steel-types such as Celesteela, while Dragonite can break past special walls such as Alolan Muk.</p> "

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew is one of the best Psychic-types due to its incredible offensive traits and very diverse utility movepool, allowing it to fill the role of a setup threat and bulky stallbreaker. This allows Mew to easily fit on almost any Psychic team due to the number of roles it can fill. Its access to a powerful signature Z-Move in Genesis Supernova in tandem with setup moves such as Nasty Plot and Rock Polish allows Mew to threaten defensive and offensive teams alike while simultaneously offering Psychic Terrain support for the team. Its ability to summon Psychic Terrain is very useful for boosting the power of the team's Psychic-type attacks while also preventing priority users such as Scizor from revenge killing it once weakened. Additionally, Mew's wide support movepool with options such as Taunt, Knock Off, and reliable recovery allows it to serve as an excellent defensive pivot for balance teams, pressuring defensive threats such as Toxapex and Chansey. On top of this, Mew's excellent mixed bulk allows it to check many of the metagame's premier offensive Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie. Specifically, Mew becomes very difficult to break down specially thanks to its invested bulk, while Will-O-Wisp enables it to check most physical attackers as well, making it extremely hard to check offensively. Mew's unpredictability and versatility further allow it to pressure opposing teams while its set is unrevealed. However, while a pure Psychic typing is decent by itself, it does not add any defensive utility to Psychic teams and instead stacks a common weakness to Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-types. Mew's power and Speed are quite lacking before setting up and using its Z-Move, so it often finds itself too dependent on setup moves in order to dent teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mew can compress a utility set with Nasty Plot and Mewnium Z in order to provide defensive support for the team while also being able to catch some of its usual defensive checks like Mantine off-guard. An EV spread of 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe with a Careful nature allows Mew to outspeed Adamant Bisharp while increasing its bulk, but misses out on outspeeding Jolly Bisharp and other positive nature base 70 Speed Pokemon, which can be crucial. Similarly, a spread of 252 HP / 120 SpD / 136 Spe with a Careful nature gives it more Speed to outspeed Pokemon such as Suicune.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye is by far the greatest counter to any of Mew's sets, being immune to both of its usual attacks while shrugging off any status move it may use with Magic Bounce. It can threaten Mew with Foul Play and its own Knock Off in return.</p> <p><strong>Other Dark-types</strong>: Despite Mew's access to Focus Blast, any Dark-type has the ability to switch into Double Dance Mew's Z-Move, making it go to waste, and take minimal damage from its Knock Off on the stallbreaker set. Strong offensive Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo can threaten Mew with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Common Bug-types carrying super effective STAB moves such as Scizor and Volcarona can usually survive an attack from any of Mew's sets and proceed to dent or KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: Although still solid when not invested, Mew's physical bulk is usually not enough to take on strong physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Victini and Tapu Bulu, though it can still burn some of them with Will-O-Wisp on the stallbreaker set.</p> <p><strong>Status: Every Mew set heavily dislikes Toxic poison, as it will easily wear it down and prevent it from sweeping or wallbreaking effectively. Paralysis cripples its Speed stat and being burned can slowly chip its HP and negate Leftovers recovery if it is the stallbreaker set.</p> <p><strong>Mantine</strong>: Mantine is a great check to both of Mew's sets, as its offensive set is neutralized by Haze while defensive variants of Mew cannot do much damage to it, although it can Taunt Mantine.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is essential, as it is Mew's only attacking move and removes the foe's item, most notably Eviolite and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Skarmory as well as items such as Choice Specs from Tapu Koko and Life Orb from Landorus. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Bisharp by halving their Attack stat and goes very well with Mew's good mixed bulk. It also chips down opposing walls in combination with Knock Off removing Leftovers. Taunt allows Mew to shut down opposing walls such as Mantine by preventing them from recovering HP or afflicting them with status conditions, helping Mew fulfill its role as a stallbreaker. Roost provides Mew with much-needed reliable recovery, allowing it to remain in the game for longer and wall opposing Pokemon far more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Mew to outspeed very important Pokemon such as Bisharp and Adamant Diggersby, allowing it to check these Pokemon while also outspeeding the majority of defensive Pokemon. 252 EVs are put into HP and the rest are placed into Special Defense alongside a Careful nature in order to maximize its special bulk while still enabling it to check various physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Leftovers is the preferred item on this set, as it gives Mew passive recovery, allowing it to remain on the field longer. Synchronize is Mew's only ability and allows it to discourage opposing Toxic users like Mantine and Gastrodon from afflicting it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Mew set focuses on checking various offensive Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp and its invested special bulk. Use Will-O-Wisp after bringing Mew out safely against offensive Pokemon such as Bisharp and Tapu Bulu in order to cripple them for the remainder of the game. However, switching Mew in against physical attackers outright is often a bad idea, as it usually depends on surviving a strong attack in order to burn the foe. Mew's invested special bulk is great and allows it to safely check special attackers such as Latios. Also, Mew's multiple methods of recovery and good mixed bulk allow the player to play liberally with it, as it will usually be able to consistently check opposing offensive Pokemon due to its longevity. Use Taunt when faced against walls that can otherwise shut Mew down, such as Chansey, as well as Pokemon attempting to clear hazards with Defog, such as Mantine. Knock Off should be used often in order to reliably remove opposing items, preventing walls from recovering HP as well as weakening offensive Pokemon by removing items such as Life Orb. The passive nature of this set means Mew may have trouble checking certain opposing Pokemon that it cannot cripple with its other moves such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Furthermore, be wary of predicted switches, as dangerous Pokemon like Hydreigon may be given a free switch depending on the move Mew chooses. Despite the utility that comes from Synchronize, it is important to avoid being poisoned by Toxic, as it will heavily limit Mew's staying time on the field by rapidly wearing it down. Mew also heavily dislikes paralysis, as it cannot stallbreak nearly as well with a crippled Speed stat. In certain matchups, it may be beneficial to get Mew burned in order to avoid other types of status. In the Water matchup, for example, it may fish for a burn from a Scald user in order to be unaffected by Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is an essential option to balance teams, meaning other Pokemon that fit the archetype are ideal teammates for Mew. Slowbro forms a very solid defensive core with Mew, being able to check Dark-types such as Mega Sharpedo with its Colbur Berry set while further crippling offensive Pokemon with Thunder Wave. In return, Mew can stomach special attacks for Slowbro due to its great invested bulk. Jirachi's fantastic typing and ability to provide much-needed entry hazard support make it a superb teammate for Mew. It can additionally give Mew safe opportunities to come in on the field thanks to its rather slow U-turn. Victini provides an offensive option able to take care of faster foes and wallbreak simultaneously with the combination of Choice Scarf and powerful moves like V-create and Bolt Strike, beating Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Mantine for Mew. Choice Band Victini also threatens defensive teams immensely with stallbreaking support from Mew. Latios and Latias are both good teammates for Mew, as they can clear hazards for Mew with Defog and check dangerous offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y. Latias additionally offers Healing Wish support, giving Mew another potential form of recovery. Mega Latias appreciates Mew's superior bulk and ability to cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, creating opportunities for a Calm Mind sweep. Additionally, its typing allows it to take on common metagame threats such as Tapu Bulu and Landorus, which Mew often struggles with. Mega Slowbro's incredible physical bulk also makes it a great Calm Mind sweeper that appreciates Mew's specially defensive support, dealing with many Electric- and Grass-types such as Zapdos and Cradily for Mega Slowbro. Mega Gallade is a threatening physical wallbreaker that can take care of many opposing Dark-types, such as Alolan Muk, and appreciates Mew's ability to Taunt opposing Pokemon and prevent their recovery. Alakazam can check certain physical attackers that trouble Mew such as Mega Sharpedo thanks to its access to Counter and Magic Guard. Celebi is a decent teammate for Mew, as it can check problematic Ground- and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Mantine, easing Mew's defensive load and providing a setup sweeper for the team.</p> "

        "name": "Double Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is easily Mew's most spammable attack, being its strongest and most reliable STAB move. It also allows Mew to fire off its powerful Genesis Supernova, nuking most threats that don't resist it while summoning Psychic Terrain. Nasty Plot boosts Mew's Special Attack to massive levels and allows it to wallbreak effectively, notably dealing with common defensive threats such as Porygon2. Rock Polish doubles Mew's Speed, allowing it to become a dangerous sweeper and outspeed the majority of the metagame after a single boost. This goes hand in hand with Nasty Plot to turn Mew into an incredible offensive Pokemon. Focus Blast offers great neutral coverage and is used to hit opposing Dark- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar and Heatran, though it can be rather unreliable due to its low accuracy.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Speed alongside a Timid nature give Mew as much initial Speed as possible before boosting in order to outpace key Pokemon, such as Landorus-T and Hydreigon, maximizing its capability as an offensive sweeper. The rest is dumped into its Special Attack to maximize its power. Synchronize is Mew's only ability and is useful for discouraging status spreaders such as Mantine from poisoning it with Toxic. Mewnium Z is required in order to give Mew access to Genesis Supernova.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Prioritize using Nasty Plot first against more defensive teams that lack revenge killers that can KO Mew. Rock Polish should be used against more offensive teams late-game as a cleaner in tandem with Genesis Supernova. However, it is very important to be wary of Dark-types while using Genesis Supernova, as they can easily waste its Z-Move by switching in on it. Despite Synchronize punishing opposing Pokemon attempting to spread status, it is still important to avoid status altogether, as poison will quickly wear it down, while being paralyzed will severely limit its effectiveness offensively. In a similar notion, do not allow Mew to take any unnecessary damage by switching it into opposing attacks as well as entry hazard damage, as this set has no way to recover its HP. It is a good idea to not reveal Mew's set early in the game in certain matchups such as Flying, as walls like Celesteela will fear the possibility of a utility set with Taunt. This gives it more leverage late-game when deciding to set up with Nasty Plot and Rock Polish. Similarly, Mew can force out many physical attackers such as Bisharp by bluffing Will-O-Wisp, though this can be rather risky and prediction-dependent.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the nature of this set, Mew appreciates offensive teammates able to capitalize on its wallbreaking and sweeping ability. Deoxys-S is a terrific teammate for Mew, being able to offer entry hazard support in tandem with Taunt to stop opposing entry hazard removers and leads. It also provides dual screens support, amplifying Mew's bulk and allowing it to remain on the field for a long time. Victini is a great offensive team option by virtue of its typing and ability to function as a strong wallbreaker with Choice Band and a way to keep faster foes in check with Choice Scarf. It can also take out threats such as Scizor and Celesteela thanks to its useful Fire typing. Mega Gallade forms a deadly wallbreaking core with Mew, pressuring defensive teams while dealing with special walls such as Chansey thanks to its massive physical power. Alakazam is an amazing blanket check to many dangerous Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo thanks to the combination of Counter and Magic Guard. Mew, on the other hand, swiftly deals with more defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos for it. Latios is a good teammate, as it can pressure many Pokemon that threaten Mew such as Mega Sableye thanks to its strong Dragon-type STAB moves and can remove entry hazards with Defog. Mega Latias brings utility as a secondary setup threat with Stored Power and Calm Mind, being able to steamroll past teams that lack answers to it such as Water. Choice Band Metagross can trap Pokemon such as Latios with Pursuit and has the immediate power to threaten defensive checks to Mew such as Chansey. Lastly, Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support for Mew while also giving it many opportunities to safely come in due to its access to U-turn.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Poison</h1> <p>Crobat provides entry hazard removal while also providing a key Ground immunity, allowing Poison teams to take on powerful and threatening Ground-types like Choice Scarf Excadrill and Landorus, making it a great utility Pokemon for Poison. Its high Speed allows it to work as a great fast pivot by chipping foes with U-turn and switching into teammates like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Crobat also has access to Taunt, which can help prevent opposing walls from healing, setup sweepers from setting up, and utility Pokemon from setting hazards. Crobat's mediocre bulk limits its ability to switch in on attacks and hazards continuously throughout the battle and forces it to switch out to defensive teammates frequently, which limits its opportunities to use Roost and Defog. Although its Flying typing provides an important Ground immunity, it also comes with a weakness to Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves, all of which are extremely common coverage and a weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits Crobat's ability to switch in and Defog throughout a battle. Crobat's mediocre Attack also prevents it from doing any notable damage to most defensive Pokemon, as they can easily recover any damage taken.</p> ",

Roost is very important for Crobat, allowing it to maintain high HP through the course of a battle. Brave Bird is Crobat's primary STAB attack that provides decent damage against unresisted foes as well as against key threats such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Gallade. U-turn allows Crobat to act as a fast pivot, enabling it to provide small chip damage to a foe while bringing in a teammate that can handle the opposing Pokemon. Taunt is an option over U-turn in order to prevent opposing walls such as Chansey from recovering, as well as prevent utility Pokemon such as Klefki and Mantine from setting hazards, using Defog, and using other non-attacking moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>192 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Crobat to outspeed important threats to the team such as Greninja and Alakazam. 252 HP EVs and 64 Defense EVs maximize Crobat's bulk. Black Sludge gives Crobat passive recovery, granting it more longevity throughout a battle. Infiltrator allows Crobat to bypass Substitute against users such as Mega Gyarados as well as bypass Reflect to more readily attack foes such Mega Gallade in the Psychic matchup.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Crobat in on opposing entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Swampert so that it can immediately remove the hazards and then pivot out with U-turn. Take advantage of Crobat's Ground immunity to switch in on Ground-type attackers like Excadrill and Landorus. Try to maintain Crobat's HP as much as possible with Roost so that it can continuously switch in on hazards and remove them. Keep momentum up in a battle by utilizing U-turn to chip down foes while switching out to a teammate that can handle the opposing Pokemon. However, be careful not to use U-turn too hastily if Crobat's HP is getting low, as it requires high HP to continuously remove hazards throughout a battle. Use Taunt liberally to shut down passive utility Pokemon and walls such as Chansey and Clefable to keep them from setting hazards and recovering HP. Be wary of switching in on opposing Pokemon looking to use Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, as paralysis inhibits Crobat's ability to outspeed and quickly pivot, and burn minimizes the damage it can do to foes while slowly reducing its HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of Crobat's potential teammates immensely appreciate Crobat's immunity to Ground and ability to remove entry hazards. Mega Venusaur is a great defensive partner for Crobat, as it is able to take on Electric-types for Crobat as well as provide passive recovery for Crobat as it switches in using Leech Seed. Mega Venusaur also pairs especially well with Crobat because, when combined, they can take on most threatening Ground-types. Alolan Muk has a very important Psychic immunity as well as great Special Defense; it serves as a great partner for Crobat in order to Pursuit trap and eliminate threatening Psychic-types that Crobat cannot handle, such as Alolan Raichu and Latios. Crobat pairs well with Toxapex, as Toxapex is able to set Toxic Spikes, and Crobat can prevent foes from effectively removing them thanks to Taunt. Additionally, Toxapex provides a very important Ice resistance and high Defense, freely switching in on Pokemon that threaten Crobat such as Weavile and Terrakion. Nihilego is a very effective revenge killer that can take on faster threats to Crobat such as Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Victini, and Mega Aerodactyl, most notably helping out with the Flying matchup. Nidoking and Nidoqueen are both able to set Stealth Rock, which chips down foes throughout the battle, working well with Crobat's ability to pivot. They are also able to take on Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types that Crobat cannot threaten such as Zapdos, Celesteela, and Nihilego. Gengar is another revenge killer that is able to take on threats to Crobat such as Jirachi and Slowbro, and it can also form a hazard-maintaining core with Crobat, as Crobat can prevent Defog with Taunt and Gengar can spinblock.</p> "

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Lanturn is a staple pick on stall Water teams because of its access to Heal Bell, allowing it to clear the status conditions of itself and its teammates, and its ability Volt Absorb, which lets it become a good check to Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Alolan Raichu. Lanturn's good special bulk gives it multiple opportunities to switch in against special attackers such as Heatran and Mega Pidgeot. Lanturn is also an effective pivot with its slow Volt Switch, allowing it to safely bring in its teammates so they can more easily check their intended targets. However, Lanturn is also very reliant on its utility moves and can be easily taken advantage of by Pokemon with Taunt or certain setup sweepers, such as Gliscor, Suicune, and Tapu Bulu. Additionally, Lanturn lacks any reliable recovery options, meaning that it is worn down very easily by repeatedly switching into attacks. Lanturn can only be effectively used on stall Water teams, as it is outclassed as an Electric-immune Pokemon by Swampert and Gastrodon on balanced teams. Even on teams Lanturn does fit into, it often requires the support of another Electric-immune Pokemon to take on Zeraora, Alolan Golem, and Thundurus, so it cannot be placed haphazardly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>Scald can be used over Protect to fish for burns and threaten out physical attackers, but Protect is generally the safer choice.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Most Ground-types hit hard enough with their STAB Ground-type moves to OHKO or nearly OHKO Lanturn, including Landorus and Excadrill. Ground-types tend to wall Lanturn as well, since it only carries Toxic, which can also be stopped by Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types fear little from Lanturn's Scald and Volt Switch, and Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur are both immune to Toxic, leaving Lanturn powerless against them. Many of Grass's setup sweepers, such as Celebi, Breloom, and Tapu Bulu, can all also use Lanturn as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Lanturn relies a lot on Toxic to threaten Pokemon, meaning that Taunt users such as Mew and Keldeo can easily shut it down.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Pokemon: Pokemon that are not affected by Toxic, such as Mega Venusaur and Jirachi, as well as Substitute users like Tapu Bulu and Suicune, can easily take advantage of Lanturn because of its reliance on Toxic to damage opposing Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Since Lanturn's physical bulk is pretty poor, strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite can OHKO it without needing a super effective move, meaning Lanturn is forced out by them. Kyurem-B can freely spam Fusion Bolt against Lanturn thanks to Teravolt bypassing Volt Absorb.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes all severely hinder Lanturn's ability to switch into threats and pivot, meaning it will get worn down very quickly if these are not dealt with properly.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Defensive (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is used for pivoting out and retaining momentum against the opposing team. Toxic is Lanturn's primary tool to pressure and put a timer on offensive foes and wear down the opposing team while working with Volt Switch to prevent Lanturn from being setup bait. Heal Bell allows Lanturn to fulfill the role of a cleric and rid itself and its teammates of status ailments from Pokemon like Toxic Zapdos, which every teammate on Water appreciates. Protect allows Lanturn to rack up Toxic damage, scout for moves, and most importantly gain passive recovery from Leftovers, keeping it healthy throughout the match.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is Lanturn's primary means of recovery, as it does not have reliable recovery. Maximum investment in special bulk along with Volt Absorb optimizes Lanturn's niche in checking special Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lanturn should be utilized as a switch-in to Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu, as well as a general switch-in to special attackers. Make sure to not recklessly switch into special attackers, however, as that will only lead to Lanturn being worn down. Lanturn lacks reliable recovery, so make sure to preserve it throughout the battle and keep it healthy, especially when its Electric immunity is vital to the team, such as in the Electric and Fairy matchups. If possible, attempt to increase Lanturn's longevity with Wish support from teammates like Alomomola. Because Leftovers is Lanturn's primary form of recovery, avoid switching into Knock Off, as it will severely hinder Lanturn's defensive presence. Moreover, avoid wearing down Lanturn so that its defensive presence can be utilized most effectively. To stay healthy, Lanturn should almost always attempt to get extra Leftovers recovery with Protect whenever possible. Apart from special attackers, Lanturn can also switch into Choice-locked physical attackers such as Zeraora and Victini with Electric coverage, which prevents them from spamming their strongest moves against Water teams. However, it should generally not be used as a physically defensive switch-in because of its low physical bulk. Lanturn should use Protect to gain health and scout the chosen move of a predicted Choice item user, such as Victini. Volt Switch should be used to pivot out against predicted switch-ins when Lanturn comes in on something it usually checks to retain momentum and put the other team on the defensive. Early-game, Lanturn should aim to spread status and wear down the opposing team through Toxic, which can be used on predicted switch-ins to catch them off guard and help wear them down. Heal Bell should be used to deny the opposing team's status spreading and recover off opposing Pokemon's status onto Lanturn. However, Lanturn should attempt to avoid status, as its recovery is limited, and Heal Bell's PP can be easily worn out by bulky teams. Thus, it is safer to use Heal Bell against a Toxic user when at least one Pokemon has been poisoned to help create a victory in the PP war, as Toxic has double the PP of Heal Bell.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Lanturn supports every Pokemon on Water teams, especially defensive Pokemon, through its immunity to Electric and ability to heal status. Alomomola eases Lanturn's recovery problem by passing Wishes and allowing it to easily regain health. Mantine is an ideal partner for Lanturn due to its Ground immunity and checking of stronger special attackers than Lanturn is able to handle. Mantine can also use Defog to clear entry hazards that can easily wear down Lanturn if left unchecked. In return, Lanturn covers Mantine's quadruple Electric weakness with its immunity and can use Electric attacks targeted at Mantine as opportunities to heal. Mantine can also use Haze against setup sweepers that attempt to boost against Lanturn. Toxapex is another great defensive partner for Lanturn. It is able to check strong Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and support Lanturn with Toxic Spikes, making it much easier for Lanturn to wear down opposing Pokemon. Thanks to Unaware, Quagsire, most importantly, is able to check setup sweepers that threaten to set up on Lanturn and the team in general, such as Mega Gallade. It also provides another Electric immunity, which can help check Zeraora, which Lanturn struggles to check on its own. Sap Sipper Azumarill helps Lanturn check Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Breloom that would otherwise easily dispatch of it. Azumarill can Perish trap these threats, as well as support Lanturn with its Dragon immunity, dissuading strong Dragon-types such as Dragonite from using Lanturn as an opportunity to spam Outrage. Empoleon can use Defog to clear entry hazards for Lanturn, preventing it from being worn down easily by Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. Thanks to Sticky Hold, Gastrodon acts as a great Knock Off or Trick switch-in while also relieving pressure from Lanturn as an Electric-immune Pokemon, similarly to Quagsire. Like Gastrodon, Mega Slowbro can switch into these moves and is also an amazing physically defensive wall, enabling it to check physical attackers such as Choice Band Diggersby that would easily break through Lanturn. It can also act as the main wincon of the team with its Calm Mind set.</p> "

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>A fantastic Attack stat thanks to Huge Power, great set up potential with Belly Drum + Normalium Z, and priority in Aqua Jet allow Azumarill to pose a massive threat to balance and offense teams alike. Alternatively, Azumarill can run a Sitrus Berry on a Belly Drum set to free up a Z-Move slot for another team member. It also forces the opponent to guess which Pokemon the potential Z-Move user is. Azumarill also has use outside of its sweeping capabilities, being able to provide utility with Knock Off to cripple Pokemon like Chansey and revenge kill threats such as Nihilego with Aqua Jet. Azumarill's Speed stat can be maximized with a Jolly nature to flip the Poison matchup, letting it outpace a massive roadblock in Mega Venusaur and bypass other would-be checks such as Rotom-W and Mantine. However, a poor Speed stat, even with a Jolly nature, leaves it reliant on Aqua Jet to remove faster threats, which will not always work against common offensive Pokemon like Latios and Tapu Bulu. Azumarill has issues sweeping no matter the nature it uses: Adamant Azumarill struggles greatly with breaking through defensive cores found on types such as Flying and Electric due to its inability to outpace and remove walls such as Mantine, while Jolly Azumarill fails to OHKO prevalent walls such as Celesteela.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Azumarill is unique in having an immunity to Grass-type moves thanks to its ability Sap Sipper, giving it a special niche for Water teams. Its Fairy typing brings the much-appreciated immunity to Dragon as well as a very welcome resistance to Dark, enabling it to check Pokemon like Hydreigon with ease when combined with its acceptable bulk. Azumarill's access to both Perish Song and Whirlpool allows it to act as a Perish trapper, trapping and removing many of the walls that Water hates to deal with such as Chansey, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. As a result, Azumarill fits on both balance and stall teams to serve as a great stallbreaker and tank. It is a huge drain on momentum, though, meaning even if offense teams need its support to beat certain walls such as Mega Venusaur, it's too much of a liability to use. Its only form of recovery is Rest, which is unreliable when trying to trap Pokemon that aren't walls and only makes its momentum problems even worse. Azumarill is also very one dimensional and uses a predictable strategy, so it may be difficult to precisely trap the Pokemon you intend to. Unfortunately, while often quite useful, the Fairy typing also makes Azumarill weak to Poison, which is a matchup Water tends to be weak in, compounding a common team problem.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Figy Berry is also an option instead of Sitrus Berry, as it will activate when Azumarill is at 25% HP or below and will restore its HP by 50%. However, if Azumarill's HP value is not 25% or lower, it will not be activated, so Azumarill will not regain HP and will be left very weakened.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Toxic is a niche option over Protect to cripple Water-immune and Ghost-type Pokemon that Azumarill cannot trap, such as Volcanion and Gourgeist-XL. However, it is generally much less useful outside of a small group of threats. Choice Band Azumarill is a very powerful wallbreaker with Huge Power, but Azumarill's poor Speed leaves it reliant on Aqua Jet, and it tends to be incapable of breaking the more dangerous walls for Water. Belly Drum and Huge Power with either Sitrus Berry or Normalium Z can make Azumarill a decent sweeper that takes many teams by surprise, but there tend to be better Z-Move users for Water teams and Azumarill lacks much of the support needed to be effective.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Faster Walls: Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, and Celebi all tank a boosted Aqua Jet and KO Azumarill in return with their super effective STAB moves. However, they have to be wary of being outpaced and KOed by Jolly Azumarill sets.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users: Mantine outpaces Adamant Azumarill and stops it with Haze, and Toxapex can stomach a single hit from Azumarill and remove its boosts.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Water-resistant Pokemon: Latios, Tapu Bulu, and Gyarados all take a boosted Aqua Jet and KO Azumarill in return.</p> <p><strong>Status: All forms of status are extremely detrimental for Azumarill. Burn prevents it from breaking walls, paralysis prevents Jolly Azumarill from outpacing and KOing walls, and poison wears it down quickly.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Thundurus are generally able to OHKO if not 2HKO Azumarill with their STAB attacks. They also tend to carry Volt Switch, enabling an escape from Azumarill if they are somehow incapable of KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Poison-types: Offensive Poison-types, such as Nihilego, are generally able to beat Azumarill with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt is a complete stop to Azumarill, as it prevents Perish Song and Rest. Users such as Gliscor and Mew are able to slowly but surely wear down Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune and Ghost-type Pokemon: Water-immune and Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Mantine and Mimikyu, cannot be trapped by Whirlpool, meaning Perish Song is not a viable way to KO them. If Azumarill doesn't carry Toxic, it cannot touch these Pokemon at all; in some cases, such as against Mega Sableye, it cannot beat them even with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Azumarill relies on being able to stall the Perish Song turns out. Especially powerful wallbreakers such as Diggersby are too strong for Azumarill to take hits from, meaning they are effective checks.</p> <p><strong>U-turn and Volt Switch: Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch such as Mega Scizor and Cobalion can pivot out of Azumarill, escaping the Whirlpool trap and Perish Song.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Belly Drum (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum allows Azumarill to maximize its Attack stat to threatening levels. Aqua Jet helps mitigate Azumarill's poor Speed stat, taking out faster Pokemon such as Volcarona and Zapdos that would otherwise threaten it. Knock Off is great against Steel teams, removing Celesteela after slight chip damage as well as taking out Ferrothorn. Play Rough is the preferred move on Adamant sets, as they are going to be slower than Return targets such as Mega Venusaur, meaning the stronger STAB attack is more important for Pokemon like Porygon2. On the other hand, Return is extremely important for Jolly Azumarill to take out Mega Venusaur with slight chip damage, as otherwise it'll be stopped and removed with one of Mega Venusaur's STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Huge Power doubles Azumarill's Attack stat. 252 Attack with 252 Speed EV investment maximizes Azumarill's power and speed; the Speed investment in particular allows Azumarill to outpace Pokemon like Klefki and defensive Mega Scizor. 4 Special Defense EVs are used to prevent Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost with Download. An Adamant nature maximizes Azumarill's Attack stat, while a Jolly nature lets it outpace checks like Mega Venusaur and Mantine. Normalium Z lets Azumarill set up against nearly anything by fully healing Azumarill before it cuts its health in half from Belly Drum.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Z-Belly Drum will not halve Azumarill's HP if it is already at +6 Attack but will still restore it to full HP, so if Azumarill is up against an extremely weak or Choice-locked resisted attacker, use Z-Belly Drum after boosting with Belly Drum to safely heal. Jolly Azumarill counters Poison and Steel teams, so make sure to maximize your chances and wait for the opportune moment to sweep. For example, increase your chances of winning by supporting Azumarill with Spikes and dual screens support from Klefki and Stealth Rock from Mega Diancie. Also, make sure to weaken Poison teams with Psychic Mega Diancie and Swords Dance + Zen Headbutt Tapu Bulu before trying to set up and sweep with Azumarill. Similarly, against Steel teams, weaken Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Celesteela with teammates like Fire Blast + Babiri Berry Clefable before setting up with Azumarill. Wear down defensive counterplay like Rotom-W into range of Azumarill's attacks before trying to sweep the opposing team, as if you use Belly Drum with major roadblocks in the way, Azumarill will accomplish nothing. Azumarill shouldn't be categorized as only a sweeper, as Knock Off provides great support; to give a specific example, Azumarill is a good lead against Flying teams, forcing Gliscor out and preventing Poison Heal from being activated, allowing Mega Diancie to 2HKO it or weaken answers like Celesteela for teammates like Mimikyu. Knock Off Azumarill is also one of the only ways that Fairy can cripple Alolan Muk. Avoid every type of status, as they all cripple Azumarill's sweeping potential. Remove phazers like Mantine before setting up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Klefki provides dual screens and Spikes support, making it easier for Azumarill to sweep. Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie are great wallbreakers, weakening or taking out troublesome Pokemon for Azumarill. Mega Diancie also provides Stealth Rock support for Azumarill. Swords Dance + Zen Headbutt Tapu Bulu weakens Poison teams, making it much easier for Azumarill to sweep late-game. Sticky Web Ribombee lets Azumarill outpace checks like Speed-invested Mega Venusaur. Mimikyu is great for dealing with Psychic teams and beats Pokemon like Celebi, Latias, and Latios that check Azumarill. Babiri Berry + Fire Blast Clefable provides Stealth Rock support and can take out checks like Mega Scizor for Azumarill.</p> "

        "name": "Sitrus Berry + Belly Drum (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum allows Azumarill to maximize its Attack stat, increasing it to sky-high levels. Aqua Jet makes up for Azumarill’s lackluster Speed, allowing it to also clean late-game after the opposing team is weakened. Knock Off allows Azumarill to break through bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Skarmory and provides further utility in removing items such as Eviolite on Chansey and Porygon2. Return is used alongside a Jolly nature in order to outspeed Mega Venusaur and OHKO it after Stealth Rock as well as break through Toxapex a lot more easily. Play Rough is Azumarill’s strongest Fairy-type STAB attack and, at +6, gets rid of almost any threat that doesn’t resist it. It is used for slower and bulkier foes. Also, an unboosted Play Rough can OHKO Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature ensure Azumarill hits as hard and fast as possible. A Jolly nature allows Azumarill to outspeed Mega Venusaur, letting it break through it with Return, and outpace common slower variants of Mantine, Mandibuzz, and Mega Scizor. Alternatively, an Adamant nature allows Azumarill to have the strongest possible Aqua Jet and guarantees the OHKO on Celesteela with a +6 Knock Off as well as letting Azumarill OHKO Porygon2 with +6 Play Rough. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into HP to give Azumarill an even value, allowing it to immediately eat its Sitrus Berry when using Belly Drum from full HP. The benefit of Sitrus Berry is that it frees up a Z-Move slot for another teammate to utilize such as Tapu Bulu or Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Azumarill should be used as a mid- to late-game sweeper after its checks are either eliminated or worn down within range of its attacks. Since Belly Drum cuts Azumarill’s HP in half, Azumarill should not take any damage if possible and avoid any status conditions such as poison, burn, and paralysis, as these can impede the progress of sweeping. Without Normalium Z, Belly Drum Azumarill must be even more careful and shouldn't take any hits if it can afford to, as if it gets too low, it cannot activate Belly Drum. With dual screens support, Azumarill can set up with Belly Drum more safely. Azumarill can also freely set up in front of Pokemon that it walls as they switch out. Aqua Jet is the main move Azumarill should use for beating faster Pokemon after using Belly Drum. Azumarill may also be sent out at an earlier point if an opposing Pokemon is very weak and can be taken out with Aqua Jet. Also, if it can remove a key item with the threat of Knock Off, it may be sent out earlier as well. Return on Jolly Azumarill is specifically run to break through Mega Venusaur, as it can outspeed and KO Mega Venusaur with Stealth Rock up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Klefki is arguably the most vital teammate, as it can set up both Reflect and Light Screen, spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, set up Spikes to break potential Focus Sashes and Sturdy, and wear down the opposing team, aiding Azumarill to sweep. Klefki also can carry Foul Play, which punishes Mega Scizor or any other Attack-boosting Pokemon from setting up Swords Dance. Tapu Bulu can switch into Electric-type attacks, which are a threat to Azumarill, and take care of bulky Water-types, mainly Water Absorb Pokemon that check Azumarill such as Seismitoad and Mantine. Tapu Bulu can also run a Z-Move, either All-Out Pummeling or Continental Crush, now that Azumarill is running Sitrus Berry, which increases Tapu Bulu's wallbreaking potential and allows it to break Pokemon it could not break before as easily. Tapu Bulu also provides Grassy Terrain, which provides Azumarill with passive recovery. Tapu Koko is also a great teammate for Azumarill, as it can get rid of Pokemon that can threaten Azumarill such as Keldeo, Gyarados, and Suicune. It also can get rid of threats that Azumarill may not be able to outspeed and KO such as faster variants of Mantine and Mandibuzz. Clefable provides Stealth Rock support to further chip away at the opposing team and break non-grounded Sturdy and Focus Sash Pokemon. With Babiri Berry and Fire Blast, Clefable can also serve as a Mega Scizor check, which can open up an opportunity for Azumarill to sweep, and wear down Ferrothorn substantially. It can also utilize Thunder Wave to slow down threats, allowing Azumarill to outspeed them. Mega Diancie is a strong mixed attacker that can break through Unaware Pokemon such as Quagsire, which Azumarill struggles to break. Mega Diancie can also bounce back potential hazards and status with the ability Magic Bounce. Mimikyu is a great teammate for Azumarill, as they both share the same checks. For example, Azumarill can break Alakazam's Focus Sash to open up a late-game clean for Mimikyu or vice versa. Mimikyu can also beat Latios, Latias, Celebi, and Jirachi, which Azumarill cannot.</p> "

        "name": "Perish Trap (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Perish Song allows Azumarill to KO any target that cannot pivot out. To make Perish Song reliable, Whirlpool prevents Pokemon from switching out of Azumarill, making sure that they are KOed. As Azumarill must take at least one or two hits to pull off the trap, Rest keeps Azumarill healthy and allows it to easily Perish trap walls by curing status and healing to full health, preventing them from permanently Toxic poisoning or seriously crippling it. Protect allows Azumarill to stall out an extra turn of Perish Song and also scouts Choice item-using Pokemon while giving another turn of Leftovers recovery, which can be the difference between surviving and being KOed by a powerful attacker.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sap Sipper makes Azumarill immune to Grass-type moves, which is an invaluable immunity for Water teams, as they are naturally weak to Grass. An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD and a Calm nature maximize Azumarill's special bulk, enabling it to take on a wide range of special attackers including Mega Charizard Y and even Mega Venusaur. A spread maximizing Azumarill's physical bulk can be used to minimize damage taken from Tapu Bulu, but it makes Azumarill less reliable overall. Leftovers gives Azumarill passive healing, improving its ability to reliably Perish trap.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Azumarill's most precious resource is its health. If it's at full HP, it can take on even Mega Venusaur. As a result, it's essential that Azumarill only take hits when it's necessary in order to Perish trap and should primarily come in on walls such as Chansey and Slowbro, as they rarely are able to beat Azumarill thanks to Rest. However, even offensive Pokemon can be beaten if Azumarill resists their main attacks; Azumarill typically needs a free switch into these threats to properly trap them, though. Once into play safely, Azumarill should almost always use Whirlpool immediately to trap either the target or whatever Pokemon switches in. In doing so, Azumarill can reduce prediction needed if a different Pokemon than it expects comes in. Whirlpool's residual damage can also actually wear down offensive threats slowly when combined with Protect, so that is a viable alternative strategy if Azumarill is unlikely to have enough time to Perish trap something. Perish Song should be used whenever it's safe after trapping a target. The time Whirlpool traps for varies, but it can be as low as only four turns, so it's important to Perish Song as soon as possible. When Perish Song is active, Protect and Rest should be used to stall turns out. As long as Azumarill is not 2HKOed, it can trap almost any Pokemon by using Perish Song, Protect, and Rest in that order. Against balance or stall teams, Azumarill should use Rest liberally even if Perish Song hasn't been activated yet, as it can easily use sleep turns on walls that can't touch it and finish trapping later.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with an Electric immunity, such as Quagsire and Lanturn, are essential for taking on the Electric-types that Azumarill cannot. Lanturn is especially useful, as it can use Heal Bell to cleanse Azumarill of status and can use its slow Volt Switch to pivot into Azumarill safely. Alomomola's huge HP means it can pass massive Wishes to Azumarill, offering it a very welcome way to heal without relying on Rest. Entry hazard users appreciate having Azumarill trap and remove Defoggers and spinners. In turn, hazards wear down switch-ins to Azumarill. Toxapex is particularly useful, as Toxic Spikes cripples Pokemon like Volcanion and Cradily that cannot be trapped, and it also supports Azumarill by checking Poison-types. Pivots of all kind make it easier to bring Azumarill into play, making VoltTurn Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja and Rotom-W great teammates. Setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados have a much easier time sweeping teams if their checks are removed by Azumarill. Suicune and Mega Slowbro are two other great examples of potent defensive setup threats that are able to more easily execute their strategy with Azumarill's support. While Azumarill is quite capable of breaking most walls, wallbreakers such as Keldeo are still useful for taking on those that are immune to Water or stallbreakers like Gliscor that Azumarill has trouble with.</p> "

However, its Ground typing also compounds its weakness to Grass-type moves. Because of this, it cannot check Grass-type setup sweepers such as Tapu Bulu, Breloom, and Celebi. Furthermore, despite having decent physical bulk, Quagsire's lackluster special bulk makes it unable to consistently check special setup sweepers such as Volcarona, Latios, and Mew. Quagsire is outclassed by other Electric immunities outside of stall teams, namely Swampert, which can set Stealth Rock, and Gastrodon with its fantastic special bulk, which can check big threats such as Choice Specs Tapu Koko and Kyurem-B for the team.</p> ",

        "name": "Unaware Wall (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald has a chance to burn, which is particularly useful for crippling physical attackers such as Mega Gallade and Mega Scizor, allowing Quagsire to wall them more easily. Earthquake hits Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Alolan Raichu for super effective damage. Protect is extremely good on stall Water for scouting attacks, racking up Toxic damage, and giving Quagsire more Leftovers recovery; it also helps keep Quagsire out of range of Mega Gallade's Close Combat and Mega Pinsir's Return. Recover is Quagsire's form of reliable recovery and keeps it healthy throughout a battle. Toxic puts opposing walls, such as Porygon2, Mantine, and Rotom-W, on timers. Counter can be used over Toxic in order to surprise physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite that Quagsire usually would not be able to handle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Defense investment along with an Impish nature allows Quagsire to switch into and check physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Choice Band Zeraora, and Mega Scizor with ease. It also minimizes the chances of Mega Gallade and Mega Pinsir 2HKOing Quagsire. Leftovers provides Quagsire with passive recovery and prevents it from easily being worn down throughout the battle. Unaware allows Quagsire to check threatening setup sweepers such as Zeraora, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Bisharp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Protect should be used to scout for attacks, which is especially useful against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Latios. It should also be used to regain health using Leftovers and rack up Toxic damage. Quagsire should be preserved in order to check setup sweepers that threaten your team, such as Dragonite, Azumarill, and Bisharp. Recover should be used constantly in order to keep Quagsire healthy so it can keep on switching into physical and Electric-type Pokemon. Quagsire should generally prioritize keeping itself healthy over spreading status. Try to avoid status conditions, particularly poison, as they hinders Quagsire's ability to check setup sweepers by putting it on a timer. With that being said, if Quagsire does happen to get afflicted with poison, try to look for opportunities to use Heal Bell with Lanturn in order to cure its status and keep it healthy. Try to use Toxic liberally in order to catch Quagsire's checks and counters such as Hydreigon and Breloom off guard in case they switch in. This makes it a lot easier to wear down said checks and counters over time through switching. Try to remove entry hazards using Defog before Quagsire is sent out, especially if Toxic Spikes and Spikes are set, as the former will make checking setup sweepers extremely hard, while the latter makes switching directly into Pokemon that Quagsire is supposed to check difficult. In the Electric matchup, Quagsire should try to scout which Pokemon is carrying Grass Knot in order to prevent itself from getting unnecessarily knocked out. As Quagsire can typically beat Alolan Raichu without Grass Knot, it is a good switch-in to a large portion of Electric-types, which is valuable in the matchup. Against teams with Choice Band Victini, try to keep Quagsire healthy, as Quagsire is one of the few Pokemon on stall Water teams that counters it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The entirety of stall Water teams appreciate Quagsire's ability to defensively check setup sweepers such as Zeraora, Azumarill, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Quagsire appreciates Toxapex as a blanket defensive check and is able to switch into Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Breloom while also being able to set up and remove Toxic Spikes and use Haze to remove boosts from setup sweepers Quagsire can't check such as Tapu Bulu, which it can threaten with Sludge Bomb. Lanturn is a great secondary Electric immunity due to Volt Absorb and its high Special Defense, allowing it to switch into strong Electric-type special attackers that otherwise threaten Quagsire like Choice Specs Tapu Koko and Grass Knot Alolan Raichu. Quagsire also appreciates its Heal Bell support that cures status conditions that wear it down, such as poison. Azumarill is able to switch into, trap, and beat threatening Grass-type setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Breloom and Tapu Bulu because of its ability in Sap Sipper. Mantine's special bulk and Flying typing allow it to switch into and check special attackers that Quagsire struggles with such as Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, and Celebi. Quagsire also appreciates Mantine's ability to remove entry hazards that cripple it upon switching in, such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes, using Defog. Similar to Mantine, Empoleon's special bulk and Steel typing also allow it to switch into special attackers that threaten Quagsire such as Mega Venusaur and Latios while being able to remove entry hazards using Defog. It can also check Calm Mind Mega Latias with Roar for Quagsire. Alomomola can use its much higher base HP to pass huge Wishes to Quagsire to support it if it ever gets worn down. Alomomola can also check special attackers using Mirror Coat and use Knock Off to hamper recovery by removing Leftovers and scout potentially dangerous attacks using Protect for Quagsire. Mega Slowbro's phenomenal Defense stat allows it to check physical wallbreakers that Quagsire is unable to check such as Choice Band Dragonite and Diggersby. Slowking is able to switch into a variety of special attackers such as Latios and Keldeo for Quagsire. It is also able to check Kommo-o and Mew, setup sweepers that Quagsire cannot check, with Dragon Tail.</p> "

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Forretress is one of the few viable forms of entry hazard control for Bug teams. Its Steel typing and physical bulk benefit Bug teams greatly, as it is able to switch into powerful Rock-types such as Terrakion and Tyranitar. Not only is Forretress one of the best hazard removers for Bug teams, but it is also among its best hazard setters. Its access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes make Forretress mendable for matchups that Bug teams may struggle with, such as Dragon, Fairy, and Water. Thanks to its low Speed, Forretress can utilize Volt Switch to bring in teammates such as Mega Pinsir and Scizor with relative safety. However, Forretress's typing, while good defensively, compounds its weakness to Fire-type moves. While Forretress is great as a utility option, the lack of offensive presence can allow itself to become setup bait for sweepers such as Kommo-o and Porygon-Z and leave it shut down by Taunt users such as Gliscor and Mew. While its physical bulk is very high, Forretress's special bulk is very poor and leaves it susceptible to many special attackers such as Porygon2 and Suicune. Forretress faces competition with Armaldo as a spinner, which has better utility through Knock Off and is able to threaten Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos with its Rock-type attacks. Armaldo also has the advantage of providing a Fire-type neutrality on top of a Flying-type neutrality.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>Toxic Spikes can be utilized in Forretress's last moveslot to chip away at bulkier foes as they switch in, such as Chansey, Suicune, and Hippowdon. A set running a Custap Berry and Explosion can be utilized to make Forretress act as a lead, as it would be able to set hazards and heavily damage the foe. Dual screens can be utilized on Forretress in order to provide teammates such as Mega Pinsir and Volcarona with better setup opportunities.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye is the best counter to Forretress, as its Magic Bounce prevents Forretress from setting hazards, while its additional Ghost typing prevents Forretress from removing them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcarona, as well as foes that carry Fire-type coverage such as Kommo-o and Magnezone, can capitalize on Forretress's 4x weakness to Fire.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Gliscor and Mew prevent Forretress from setting entry hazards and force it to switch out as a result.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Decidueye prevent Forretress from removing hazards through Rapid Spin, shortening the longevity of Bug teams.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Forretress's terrible special bulk leaves it susceptible to many special attackers such as Hydreigon, Suicune, and Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers such as Keldeo and Kommo-o can take advantage of Forretress's passivity.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rapid Spin allows Forretress to remove entry hazards from its side of the field, which is especially important because Bug teams don't have a reliable Defog user to utilize. Stealth Rock is used to support teammates such as Mega Scizor and Heracross, as it assists in breaking down foes. Volt Switch allows Forretress to pivot out against foes that block its hazards or wall it completely, such as Mega Sableye and Toxapex. Gyro Ball is used as a means of damaging faster foes such as Tapu Bulu and Terrakion. It's especially useful against Fairy teams, as it's able to OHKO Mega Diancie, which would otherwise block Forretress's hazards. Spikes can be used to stack damage against grounded foes upon entry, which helps teammates such as Volcarona and Mega Pinsir break down teams more reliably.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment paired with a Relaxed nature makes Forretress as physically bulky as possible. Additionally, a Relaxed nature enables Forretress to guarantee as slow of a Volt Switch as possible to safely bring in a teammate. It also amplifies Gyro Ball's damage output. Sturdy allows Forretress to take hits from full HP such as Fire-type moves, which ensures Forretress will be able to set up at least one hazard most of the time. Leftovers provide passive recovery for Forretress, as its solid physical bulk is useful for taking on foes such as Tapu Bulu and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Forretress can be used as lead to scout the foe's options thanks to Sturdy. However, against major threats to Bug teams such as Mega Pinsir and Terrakion, it should be conserved as much as possible in order to reliably check them. Bring in Forretress against powerful physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion that otherwise threaten its teammates. It's ideal to remove entry hazard setters from the opponent's side of the field first, as continually removing hazards with Forretress causes Bug teams to lose momentum and creates setup opportunities for the opponent. Additionally, when the opponent's hazard setters are removed, it opens up opportunities for Forretress to set its own hazards. Utilize Volt Switch often to gain momentum and prevent getting set up on by foes such as Keldeo and Mega Latias. Forretress should also utilize its slow Volt Switch to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and into teammates that can take care of them better. It should also use Gyro Ball to catch faster targets such as Tapu Koko and Terrakion as they switch in, as foes like these heavily threaten Bug teams with their offensive prowess.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Forretress's Bug-type teammates appreciate its ability to spin away entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, which many of them are weak to. Setup sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Volcarona must be healthy in order to break down bulky foes such as Toxapex and Celesteela much more effectively. Choice Scarf Heracross checks Steel-types that Forretress can't touch, such as Heatran and Magnezone. It can also Pursuit trap Victini, an incredible threat to Forretress. Alternatively, Buzzwole can be used as a Choice Scarf user, as its great base Attack and solid movepool make it better equipped to handle bad matchups such as Dragon and Flying. Choice Band Scizor and Mega Scizor check Fairy- and Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Tyranitar much better and can allow Forretress to forego Gyro Ball and use Spikes instead. Additionally, Choice Band Scizor can Pursuit trap Choice Band Victini, which is a terrifying threat to Forretress. Galvantula acts as a check to Flying-types such as Celesteela and Mega Charizard Y thanks to its Compound Eyes-boosted Thunder and appreciates Forretress's ability to remove hazards for it and help it preserve its Focus Sash. Araquanid acts as an amazing check to Fire-types such as Heatran, Alolan Marowak, and Volcarona by virtue of its typing and unique ability, Water Bubble.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Mega Steelix is used on Ground teams without sand as a powerful setup sweeper through Curse and helps to turn the tide against problematic matchups such as Dragon, Fairy, and Normal. Mega Steelix's insane physical bulk allows it to tank hits such as Adamant Azumarill's +6 Aqua Jet and a Swords Dance-boosted Close Combat from Mega Gallade, the latter after a Curse boost. Its secondary Steel typing allows Mega Steelix to provide a critical Grass-type neutrality for Ground teams, considering that it's one of the few good checks to all of Tapu Bulu's possible sets, and grants it the ability to check Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Alolan Ninetales. However, because it only carries one attack, it can be detrimental in other matchups such as Steel and Water. While Mega Steelix's physical bulk is incredible, its special bulk can be easily taken advantage of by special sweepers such as Keldeo and Volcarona. Mega Steelix also relies on Rest as its form of recovery, which can leave it vulnerable to powerful special attackers such as Landorus and Nidoking.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p>A Careful nature can be used over Impish in order for Mega Steelix to tank special hits from foes such as Kyurem-B better, though it comes at the cost of the massive Defense boost that an Impish nature provides.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Switch-ins: Because Heavy Slam is Mega Steelix's only attack, various Steel-type switch-ins such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Mega Slowbro, and Torkoal can take advantage of Mega Steelix with ease.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Various Water-types such as Keldeo and Suicune can force Mega Steelix out, as they take advantage of it only having Heavy Slam by setting up on it easily.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Bulky Taunt users such as Gliscor and Mew prevent Mega Steelix from setting up Curse boosts and recovering its health.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers: Despite Mega Steelix being heavily invested in Special Defense, powerful special attackers such as Hydreigon, Landorus, and Volcarona have the capacity to OHKO or 2HKO Mega Steelix with their powerful special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Physically bulky foes such as Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Porygon2 can stomach Mega Steelix's Heavy Slam and recover off any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phazers: Common Haze users such as Mantine and Toxapex as well as phazers such as Hippowdon and Skarmory can force Mega Steelix out, eliminating any Curse boosts attained as a result.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Curse boosts Mega Steelix's Attack and Defense stats to high levels. With one boost, Mega Steelix can survive powerful attacks such as a Swords Dance-boosted Close Combat from Mega Gallade. Heavy Slam is Mega Steelix's only attack but is incredibly strong, with Mega Steelix's incredible weight and the STAB boost to back up its power, allowing it to KO walls such as Curse Alolan Muk and Porygon2 with prior boosting. Rest grants Mega Steelix the opportunity to set up on foes like Mew and Mega Sableye that rely on burns in order to check it whilst restoring its health and status. Sleep Talk is used in tandem with Rest to grant Mega Steelix the opportunity to boost itself with Curse further as well as fire off powerful Heavy Slams while asleep.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Steelix has nearly unparalleled physical bulk, so it invests EVs into HP and Special Defense to become as specially bulky as possible. An Impish nature magnifies Mega Steelix's already amazing Defense, making its Curse boosts much more effective.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Steelix acts as a very bulky late-game sweeper thanks to Curse boosting its already powerful Heavy Slam, but it can only do so when its checks such as Keldeo and Nidoking are removed. It must be preserved as much as possible against Fairy teams, as foes such as Azumarill and Tapu Bulu can outright sweep Ground teams if Mega Steelix is KOed. Mega Steelix should also be preserved against Kyurem-B, as it is an incredible threat that can singlehandedly dismantle entire Ground teams. Because Mega Steelix only carries Heavy Slam as its attack, it can be useless in many matchups such as against Steel and Water teams. In situations like these, it can be used as a status absorber for its teammates or as a sacrifice to bring them in. Mega Steelix should avoid bulky Taunt users such as Gliscor and Mew at all costs, as Taunt essentially invalidates its forms of setup and recovery. It can also utilize Rest as a PP stalling tool, which may be necessary and is especially good against teams that often rely on wearing down the opponent with residual damage such as Normal and Dark. Mega Steelix can also determine what it should do with its remaining sleep turns; it can either utilize Sleep Talk to damage foes or gain a Curse boost or remain asleep and not waste any PP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus utilizes its incredible wallbreaking power attained from Sheer Force and a Life Orb to threaten various enemies to Mega Steelix such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Toxapex. Gastrodon provides a critical Water-type immunity for Mega Steelix, being able to comfortably handle problematic foes such as Greninja, Mantine, and Suicune thanks to its good bulk and reliable recovery. Garchomp's greater Speed and immediate power make it a better check to threatening Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon, and it also breaks down bulky presences such as Mantine and Swampert through the combination of Swords Dance and a Z-Move. Mamoswine can check problematic Dragon- and Flying-types such as Kommo-o and Zapdos with its Ice-type STAB moves for Mega Steelix. Additionally, it can use Ice Shard to pick off fast foes such as Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny that otherwise pose a danger to Mega Steelix. Gliscor has various utility options, ranging from Defog to remove entry hazards and Knock Off to hamper recovery, all of which are functions that Mega Steelix appreciates. Choice Scarf Excadrill can be used to revenge kill foes that threaten Mega Steelix, such as Mega Charizard Y and Nidoking. Its access to Rapid Spin also comes in handy for extending Mega Steelix's longevity slightly. Nidoking serves as a means of checking various threats for Mega Steelix with its Sheer Force-boosted attacks, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Heatran. Dugtrio assists Mega Steelix by being able to trap and remove problematic foes such as Nidoking and Toxapex that it would otherwise struggle with.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Scizor's useful Steel typing and access to a spammable Technician-boosted STAB move in Bullet Punch makes it a fantastic pick on Bug teams. Its Bug / Steel typing gives it a neutrality to Flying-type attacks and a resistance to Fairy-type moves, making it extremely valuable in those matchups. Likewise, it resists eight types, including Normal and Steel, and has decent natural bulk. This makes setting up Swords Dance much easier for it and lets it function as a pivot. Furthermore, Scizor has a great movepool that complements its ability Technician, with moves like Bullet Punch and Bug Bite being boosted. Bullet Punch, being a priority move, also lets Scizor check huge threats to Bug teams like Mega Diancie, Nihilego, and Tapu Koko in addition to making Scizor itself hard to revenge kill. Scizor doesn't lack in the utility department either, with moves like Knock Off and U-turn, a boosting move in Swords Dance, and reliable recovery in Roost. In addition to all this, Mega Scizor has great bulk and a monstrous Attack stat. Since Scizor can run many sets, it is often unpredictable, especially when paired with Heracross, as it can be difficult to tell which is the Mega Evolution. However, when partnered with Pinsir, it is obvious that Scizor is not the Mega Evolution. Unfortunately, Scizor has a crippling weakness to Fire-types, making it often useless against Fire teams. Its low Speed also means that faster Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch like Keldeo can easily switch in and revenge kill it. Mega Scizor faces a lot of competition with the other Bug-type Mega Evolutions. It is preferable to run Mega Scizor when the team has a reliable way of trapping Victini and taking on Water and Poison teams.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Mega Scizor's great Bug / Steel typing, which grants it a neutrality to Ground- and Fighting-type moves, combined with its great overall bulk and access to Swords Dance makes it a fantastic setup sweeper. Its bulk allows it to pivot into many threats to Steel teams like Mega Alakazam, Meloetta, and Alolan Raichu. Mega Scizor has a wide movepool that includes coverage options like Superpower and Knock Off and reliable recovery in Roost. It can also pivot with U-turn, supporting setup sweepers like Bisharp. In addition to this, Mega Scizor has access to a great Technician-boosted STAB move in Bullet Punch, which, being a priority move, makes Mega Scizor hard to revenge kill once it has set up. Between its defensive and offensive options, Mega Scizor is often an unpredictable setup sweeper. In addition, Mega Scizor can effectively run Facade to punish bulky Water-type Scald users like Mantine and Toxapex that try to cripple its regular sets. However, Mega Scizor has an extremely exploitable weakness to Fire-type moves, which means Pokemon carrying Fire-type coverage like Garchomp can easily take it out. Its Steel typing also means that Magnezone can trap it and take it out with Hidden Power Fire. Furthermore, Fire-types resist Scizor's STAB moves, making it next to useless in the Fire-type matchup. Mega Scizor also sits at a below-average Speed tier, which means it can be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, like Keldeo and Infernape.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>Iron Plate can be used instead of Scizorite on the Swords Dance set to leave place for another Mega Evolution. However, it makes Scizor too reliant on Bullet Punch. Defog can be used to remove entry hazards, but that forces Scizor to lose out on important coverage or Swords Dance. Defensive Swords Dance can also be used, but that limits Mega Scizor's ability as a sweeper, which is a big momentum drain for Bug teams, which are generally very offensive.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Pursuit is an option to prevent threats that Mega Scizor checks from switching out, like Meloetta and Alolan Raichu. However, the utility provided by U-turn and Knock Off is more useful. Defog is an option on Mega Scizor; however, most Steel teams rely on stacking entry hazards, which makes Defog counterproductive. On offensive Mega Scizor, Knock Off helps with defensive cores found on types like Water that the original coverage struggles with.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Magnezone: Magnezone is able to trap Scizor with Magnet Pull and easily take it out with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon resist both of Scizor's STAB attacks and effortlessly remove it with their own STAB attacks. Furthermore, certain Fire-types like Mega Charizard X can use it to set up.</p> <p><strong>Volcarona: Volcarona is an even bigger threat than other Fire-types because it resists Superpower and does not take much from Knock Off because of its Z-Crystal. It can switch in on an attack from Scizor, cripple it with a burn from Flame Body, and set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Dragonite can take Scizor's Bullet Punch and OHKO it with a Fire-type move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Pokemon: Pokemon like Keldeo and Zapdos resist Bullet Punch and are often able to take it out with a strong attack.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Scald and Will-O-Wisp users can make Scizor completely useless with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically Defensive Pokemon are able to safely take hits from Scizor while being able to force it out through different methods. For example, Porygon2 is able to KO it with Hidden Power Fire and defensive Water-types can burn it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela: Celesteela easily takes any attack Scizor throws at it while being able to OHKO it with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory completely walls Scizor, delivers residual damage through Rocky Helmet, and prevents Scizor from setting up due to Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex resists all of Scizor's attacks bar Knock Off while being able to burn it with Scald and prevent it from setting up due to Haze.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Bullet Punch and take little damage from Mega Scizor's other moves. In return, they can use their 4x super effective STAB moves to easily OHKO Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory completely walls Mega Scizor and can just phaze it or use it as bait to set Spikes or Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex completely walls Mega Scizor and can clear its stat boosts with Haze. Toxapex can repeatedly recover health with Recover and fish for burns with Scald. However, if Mega Scizor has Facade and gets burned, Toxapex is easily beaten.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone can trap Mega Scizor thanks to Magnet Pull and KO it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Almost all Water-types can easily take a boosted Bullet Punch. Defensive Water-types can threaten Mega Scizor with Scald, while wallbreakers like Keldeo can 2HKO it without trouble.</p> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Steel- and Electric-types, such as Heatran and Zapdos, can easily take a boosted Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and outspeed and KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Pokemon like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Greninja can survive a boosted Bullet Punch and take Mega Scizor out with their respective Fire-type coverage moves. Fairy-types like Clefable and Togekiss that carry Babiri Berry can surprise Mega Scizor and take it out with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon like Porygon2, Swampert, and Hippowdon can take a boosted hit from Mega Scizor and can take it out with Hidden Power Fire, threaten it with a Scald burn, or phaze it, respectively.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Scizor's Attack to high levels. Bullet Punch is a fantastic Technician-boosted priority STAB move that lets Scizor clean teams up easily. Bug Bite is Scizor's strongest STAB move and, once boosted, lets it break through checks like Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur. Superpower completes Scizor's coverage by allowing it to hit Steel-types like Excadrill and Skarmory. It also allows Scizor to break through Normal teams' threatening defensive core of Chansey and Porygon2. After Stealth Rock damage, +2 Mega Scizor will OHKO Porygon2. Knock Off can alternatively be used in order to remove items from bulky threats like Normal's aforementioned core while also crippling Pokemon that try switching in on Mega Scizor such as Heatran and Keldeo.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature let Scizor hit as hard and fast as possible, outspeeding Pokemon like Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur. Light Metal prevents Trace users like Porygon2 from gaining Technician as an ability, which could power up Hidden Power Fire. Scizorite lets Scizor Mega Evolve and gain additional bulk and Attack. It also gains Technician, which boosts the power of the STAB moves on this set. Life Orb is an alternative to free up the Mega slot.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Evolve Scizor right away to get the boost in bulk and Attack. If Mega Scizor cannot clean up with Bullet Punch, it can be used to set up and wallbreak at other points in the game, helping its teammates clean up. Make sure to keep Mega Scizor away from burns, as they can render it almost useless. Keep entry hazards off the field because too much residual damage prevents Mega Scizor from being able to set up and clean. Do not set up on Pokemon carrying Foul Play such as Klefki and Porygon2, nor against teams with Choice Scarf Magnet Pull Magnezone and faster threats that wouldn't be KOed by Bullet Punch. Use Bullet Punch to revenge kill weakened or vulnerable threats. Bring in Mega Scizor on Pokemon that would be forced to switch out like Mega Lopunny and use that opportunity to use Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Armaldo and Forretress provide Mega Scizor with amazing Rapid Spin support to prevent it from receiving too much residual damage, thus making it easier to set up. They both also have access to Stealth Rock, which wears down the opposing team, making Mega Scizor's sweep much easier late-game. Armaldo is generally preferred because it has better type synergy with Mega Scizor, as it is neutral to Fire-type attacks. Volcarona deals with some of Scizor's biggest threats such as Celesteela and Steel-types in general. Mega Scizor can switch in on Rock-type attacks that threaten Volcarona and set up. Volcarona can handle physically bulky Pokemon and break down the opposing team, allowing Mega Scizor to sweep late-game. Similarly, Scizor can break down specially defensive Pokemon, creating an opportunity or Volcarona to sweep. Yanmega can be used to deal with the Water- and Fighting-types that Mega Scizor generally struggles with., particularly Keldeo and Buzzwole. Galvantula's and Araquanid's access to Sticky Web makes up for Mega Scizor's lackluster Speed stat. This allows Mega Scizor to outspeed offensive Heatran. Heracross takes out threats like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona with Stone Edge on a Choice Scarf set. It also is able to check Heatran. Buzzwole can be used instead of Heracross, as it has a wider movepool and superior bulk. However, its lower Speed makes it worse at dealing with other Choice Scarf users like Togekiss and Dragon Dance users like Gyarados. Nonetheless, it can take out some of the Dragon-types that Mega Scizor cannot handle without setting up, such as Garchomp, non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Dragonite. Araquanid supports Scizor by dealing with Fire-types. Likewise, Mega Scizor is able to deal with the Rock-types that threaten Araquanid.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch provides a strong STAB priority move that lets Scizor clean up weakened teams late-game and revenge kill weakened Pokemon. U-turn is a strong STAB move that gives the team momentum. It also allows Scizor to get residual damage on Pokemon that would threaten it. Superpower allows Scizor to hit other Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill. Knock Off helps by removing items from Pokemon that would normally switch in on Scizor such as Mantine and Toxapex. Pursuit traps and KOes Victini after Sticky Web and a V-create, thus eliminating one of the biggest threats to Bug teams. It also traps Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs optimize Scizor's use as an offensive threat and allow it to outspeed Pokemon like Rotom-W. Choice Band insures that Scizor hits the hardest it can. A Jolly nature is given in order for Scizor to outspeed Choice Scarf Victini after two V-creates or after one V-create and Sticky Web. Technician boosts the power of Bullet Punch and Pursuit, the former being Scizor's most spammed move. However, the latter is only boosted if the foe does not switch out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used to soften up walls with its powerful Choice Band-boosted coverage moves early-game to set itself up for a late-game sweep with Bullet Punch. U-turn is a great way to soften up opposing walls and punish the many switches that Scizor forces. It also provides the team with amazing momentum, bringing Scizor's teammates in safely. Try to keep Scizor away from burns, as it can no longer clean up with Bullet Punch or force any switches with one. For example, Scizor can't even OHKO extremely frail Pokemon like Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock damage. Preserve Scizor for late-game against Fairy- and Rock-type teams, when it can usually clean up with Bullet Punch. Thanks to its strong Bullet Punch, Scizor can also be used to revenge kill many threats such as weakened Tapu Koko. At the same time, be wary of what coverage move Scizor is locked into, as it can end up being setup fodder for Pokemon like Gyarados or can be trapped by Magnezone. If running Pursuit, bring in Scizor after Victini uses V-create while being affected by Sticky Web in order to trap and eliminate it. Pursuit can be similarly used to take out a weakened Heatran or get some residual damage on a Pokemon that attempts to switch out in fear of Superpower.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Armaldo and Forretress are both able to clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set up Stealth Rock. This is essential because it helps Scizor clean once the opposing team has taken too much residual damage. However, Forretress shares Scizor's 4x weakness to Fire, so Armaldo is preferable. Volcarona takes care of Scizor's Steel-type counters, notably Celesteela and Skarmory. In a similar fashion, Scizor deals with the Rock-type Pokemon that pressure Volcarona. Scizor is also able to use U-turn on a switch to bring it in safely. Another amazing advantage of Volcarona's is that it forces Victini to use V-create, which allows Scizor to come in and trap it. Furthermore, it deals with physical walls. Galvantula can set up Sticky Web, which lessens the effect of Scizor having a mediocre Speed stat. Araquanid can also accomplish this while easily switching in on Fire-type attacks and hitting Pokemon of that type with strong Water Bubble-boosted Water-type attacks. In exchange, Scizor can eliminate the Rock-types that threaten it like Terrakion. Sticky Web makes trapping Choice Scarf Victini easier and allows Scizor to outspeed offensive Heatran. Mega Pinsir assists Scizor in wallbreaking and can clean the opposing team after Scizor breaks through it. As with Volcarona, Scizor can safely bring in Mega Pinsir with U-turn on switches. Heracross is essential for taking on offensive threats like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. It also deals with fast Steel-type threats to Scizor such as Heatran by OHKOing them with Close Combat. If Scizor is running Pursuit, Heracross gets an extra moveslot. This leaves place for Mega Heracross to be used; however, it functions more as a wallbreaker that can obliterate teams with support from Sticky Web. Buzzwole also accomplishes this, but its inferior Speed stat can be troublesome.</p> "

Bullet Punch, boosted by Technician, is great priority against offensive types like Dragon. Bug Bite, also boosted by Technician, is Mega Scizor's other STAB attack that lets it take care of more sturdy walls like Hippowdon. Superpower alleviates Mega Scizor's issue of not being able to hit opposing Steel-types. It also lets Mega Scizor break through defensive checks like Porygon2 that it would otherwise lose to.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs make Mega Scizor as fast and strong as possible. A Jolly nature lets it outpace Adamant Diggersby, and an Adamant nature lets it maximize its power. Technician boosts Bullet Punch and Bug Bite.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Take advantage of Choice-locked attackers like Latios by setting up on them. Chip offensive answers like Fire Blast Garchomp into range of Bullet Punch before attempting to sweep. Similarly, take care of defensive answers like Foul Play Mandibuzz before attempting to sweep. As with the majority of other physical attackers, look out for status, particularly burn, as it will cripple Mega Scizor. Make use of Bug Bite against Pokemon that frequently carry Iapapa Berry like Rotom-W and Alolan Muk for free healing. It is difficult to capitalize on Mega Scizor's amazing bulk and fantastic defensive typing without Roost, so preserve its health and get it in by means of double switches or pivots like Volt Switch Magnezone.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran takes on Fire-types that Mega Scizor struggles with and cripples defensive counterplay like Toxapex and Mandibuzz with Magma Storm, Taunt, and potentially Toxic. Mold Breaker Toxic from Excadrill cripples defensive checks like Mandibuzz and Mega Sableye. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Skarmory are all great at chipping down answers with Spikes and Stealth Rock. Volt Switch Magnezone is great for trapping and chipping down answers like Heatran and gets Mega Scizor in for free with Volt Switch. Strong setup sweepers like Swords Dance Bisharp and Lucario can form a wallbreaking core with Mega Scizor. Celesteela can provide it with Leech Seed recovery and break down walls with Toxic. Z-Happy Hour Jirachi and Mega Scizor form a great core, breaking down each other's checks and counters; for example, Jirachi helps with Poison-types like Toxapex that Mega Scizor struggles with. Calm Mind Jirachi is also great for weakening down the defensive core found on Water teams, something that Mega Scizor can't break through.</p> "

        "name": "Bulky Facade (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's best STAB move, being a Technician-boosted priority move that can eliminate faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko. Facade allows Mega Scizor to take advantage of status conditions, mainly burns, in order to better damage some of its defensive checks in Mantine and Toxapex. Swords Dance boosts Mega Scizor's Attack stat. Roost allows it to stay healthy and aids it in creating better setup opportunities.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs and 48 Defense EVs coupled with an Impish nature ensure that Mega Scizor avoids being 2HKOed from Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick and also survives hits such as Gyarados's +1 Supersonic Skystrike after Stealth Rock damage. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed foes such as Jolly Azumarill and faster variants of Mantine and Mega Venusaur. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to maximize its power. Technician is used to boost the power of Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Scizor should utilize this set to take advantage of burns, enabling it to threaten foes such as Mantine and Toxapex much more effectively. Mega Scizor should attempt to set up a Swords Dance against foes such as Suicune and Toxapex, as these foes most likely will attempt to cripple it solely through burns. It should also wait to reveal Facade in order to effectively lure its intended targets, namely bulky Water-types. However, there are some scenarios where it should avoid being burned, as it requires the use of Bullet Punch to better remove weakened foes such as Tapu Koko. Avoid Taunt users such as Gliscor and Mew, as they can prevent Mega Scizor from setting up and recovering, allowing them to break it down. Mega Scizor should also utilize Bullet Punch to revenge kill weakened foes and threats such as Mega Lopunny and Tornadus-T. It should also utilize Roost every now and then to keep itself healthy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran's incredible ability to provide a Fire immunity is critical for any Steel team, making it an important teammate for Mega Scizor. Additionally, it has the ability to check and remove some of Mega Scizor's checks such as Ferrothorn and Victini. Ferrothorn's typing makes it a blanket check to bulky Water-types that Scizor finds difficulty taking advantage of, such as Empoleon. Additionally, Ferrothorn's utility functions in Leech Seed support and hazard stacking grant Mega Scizor more opportunities to reliably break down the opposition. Celesteela's well-rounded bulk and typing make it an optimal partner for Mega Scizor that can stomach powerful attacks from foes such as Greninja and Landorus. Celesteela can also use an Autotomize set with Metronome to break some of Mega Scizor's walls such as Hippowdon and Porygon2. Choice Scarf Excadrill is able to threaten faster foes that Mega Scizor cannot check, such as Nidoking and Choice Band Victini. Additionally, Excadrill has the option of being a utility lead, being able to both set and remove hazards reliably and spread around Toxic with the help of Mold Breaker, enabling Mega Scizor to deal with foes such as Mandibuzz and Mega Sableye much more easily. Choice Scarf Magnezone can trap opposing Steel-types such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn that would otherwise wall Mega Scizor through Magnet Pull. Additionally, Magnezone can threaten Mega Scizor's offensive checks such as Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo and can bring it in with Volt Switch. Jirachi can utilize a Z-Happy Hour set that makes it a potent revenge killer against some of Mega Scizor's checks in Celesteela, Mega Charizard Y, and Infernape. Bisharp assists Mega Scizor by using Knock Off to cripple its defensive checks such as Porygon2 and Mega Slowbro, while also using its priority in Sucker Punch to threaten foes such as Mega Gallade and Victini.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive Swords Dance (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Scizor's Attack and helps it maintain offensive presence. Bullet Punch is a strong STAB priority move that lets Mega Scizor pick off weakened Pokemon and clean up late-game. Roost gives Mega Scizor a reliable form of recovery that helps it pivot into threats like Mega Alakazam more easily. U-turn is a secondary STAB move that allows Mega Scizor to take advantage of forced switches and pivot into its teammates. Knock Off is an option over U-turn and gives Mega Scizor general utility in getting rid of the items of its switch-ins, like Porygon2 and Doublade.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The investments in HP and Special Defense along with a Careful nature let Scizor switch into Modest Mega Alakazam's Focus Blast in regular forme and avoid the KO after Mega Evolving. Life Orb Alolan Raichu's Thunderbolt also fails to 2HKO Mega Scizor even after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to take physical hits from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Terrakion better. Light Metal is the ability of choice, as it reduces the power of Low Kick prior to Mega Evolving. Mega Scizor gains Technician after Mega Evolving, which boosts the power of its Bullet Punch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Evolve Scizor as soon as possible in order to gain the extra bulk and Technician. Use Mega Scizor primarily as a pivot early-game in order to weaken its checks and bring its teammates in safely. Mega Scizor can switch into threats like Mega Alakazam, Life Orb Alolan Raichu, and Meloetta and threaten them out with U-turn or Knock Off. Don't be afraid to set up Swords Dance and U-turn right out. Setting up with Mega Scizor makes gaining momentum with U-turn much more effective. However, be careful of using U-turn on Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory and Pokemon like Garchomp, as the chip damage can wear Mega Scizor down quickly. Freely spam Bullet Punch towards the end of the game once all of its checks have been weakened. If Knock Off is used, use it as much as possible early-game to remove the foe's item. Use Roost liberally to keep Mega Scizor healthy to check threats like Mega Gardevoir. Avoid letting Mega Scizor get burned, as this halves its Attack and prevents it from cleaning up. Be wary of giving Magnezone a free switch into Mega Scizor, as it can trap Mega Scizor and remove it with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Scizor should use U-turn on a predicted switch to Magnezone in this situation.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is fantastic teammate for Mega Scizor due to its ability to switch into Fire-type moves. It can also remove walls like Skarmory. In return, Mega Scizor can check Fighting-types that threaten Heatran like Terrakion and Heracross while being able to handle Ground-types decently well. Skarmory's Ground immunity allows it to check strong Ground-type wallbreakers like Choice Band Excadrill and Diggersby. It can also set Spikes and Stealth Rock, which help Mega Scizor clean up more easily. Ferrothorn can set entry hazards like Spikes and Stealth Rock while also being able to check Water-types like Kingdra. Celesteela can help deal with Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn with Earthquake and Flamethrower. It can also wear down checks to Mega Scizor with Leech Seed + Protect. Magnezone traps and removes Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela for Mega Scizor. It also checks Water-types like Keldeo and forms a great VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor. Excadrill can surprise Mega Sableye with Toxic and clear hazards with Rapid Spin, letting Mega Scizor pivot freely, while also checking Fire- and Electric-types thanks to its Ground typing. Setup sweepers like Bisharp also appreciate Mega Scizor's slow U-turn.</p> "

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Shuckle's niche in Monotype is carved by its solid bulk and ability to get up at least one entry hazard in almost every game due to Mental Herb and Sturdy. Its typing gives it another niche, as a neutrality to Fire- and Flying-type attacks is extremely relevant for Bug-type teams. Shuckle also has access to solid utility options such as Knock Off and Encore that help improve its viability outside of hazard setting. However, Shuckle is vulnerable to sleep inducers such as Breloom and has no chance of beating prevalent Magic Bounce users like as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. Shuckle struggles to get more than one hazard up against hazard removers such as Skarmory and Crobat, as it has no attacking presence, relies on Toxic to pressure them, and can’t hope to PP stall them due to its lack of reliable recovery. Part of Shuckle's niche as a hazard setter, Sticky Web, is almost always useless against bulkier or stall teams, as these types of teams rely on slow, bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Chansey that don't care about lowered Speed. Shuckle's lack of reliable recovery compromises its ability to be a useful switch-in to Fire- and Flying-type attacks. Shuckle has big competition in the forms of Galvantula and Armaldo as a hazard setter because unlike Shuckle, they can offensively pressure hazard removers. Armaldo can also use Rapid Spin to clear threatening hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes for the rest of the team.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Shuckle is an incredible asset to Rock teams due to its access to a helpful utility in Sticky Web, bolstering Terrakion and Mega Diancie's effectiveness against faster teams. Its Bug typing grants it neutralities to Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks, allowing it to easily fit onto any Rock team. This, in tandem with its incredible bulk, allows it to set up entry hazards reliably and switch into Grass- and Fighting-types like Breloom and Infernape. Sturdy allows Shuckle to take a hit from wallbreakers like Stakataka and Keldeo, allowing it to set up Sticky Web against them. Access to Knock Off allows it to remove Eviolite from Chansey and Porygon2, as well as Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Heracross and Landorus-T. This allows Terrakion, Mega Diancie, and Nihilego to deal with these threats with greater ease. With Encore, Shuckle is capable of disrupting setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Terrakion, and Mega Gallade. Encore also helps against passive Pokemon like Mantine and Toxapex, since locking them into status moves can allow an offensive threat to switch in safely. Locking enemies into an attack also ensures that they cannot recover any health. However, Shuckle is held back by its non-existent offensive presence, leaving it susceptible to Pokemon with Taunt such as Gliscor, Mew, and Heatran after its Mental Herb has been consumed and by Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, which can prevent Shuckle from setting up entry hazards. Shuckle's typing leaves it vulnerable to Stealth Rock, which can severely limit its ability to switch in. This, when combined with lack of reliable sustainability, results in Shuckle being worn down very quickly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>Opting for a more specially defensive spread allows Shuckle to set up entry hazards on strong special attackers. Infestation increases Shuckle’s potential to set up hazards, as it lets Shuckle trap and reliably set hazards against Pokemon like Clefable. Lum Berry trades Shuckle’s ability to set up hazards against Taunt users like Deoxys-S for the ability to set up against sleep inducers like Breloom.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Infestation can be paired with Encore as a means of trapping and wearing down certain Pokemon, as well as granting a safe switch into an offensive threat. However, Knock Off is more valuable, as it grants the ability to remove Choice Scarf and Eviolite. Toxic is an option for wearing down walls such as Hippowdon, Zapdos, and Mantine. However, this would come at the cost of disrupting setup sweepers with Encore. A specially defensive spread can be used to survive hits from threatening special attackers like Landorus and Nidoking. However, a physically defensive spread is more effective for switching into common physical attackers like Landorus-T and Heracross.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users: Magic Bounce users, notably Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, easily switch into any of Shuckle’s moves and render it useless.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers: Hazard removers such as Skarmory and Excadrill prevent Shuckle from completing its role as a suicide lead, as they have no problem clearing hazards against Shuckle. However, they are susceptible to Encore, which turns them into setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: Sleep inducers such as Breloom and Mega Venusaur prevent Shuckle from setting hazards and can set up.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Keldeo, Mega Swampert, Gyarados, and Manaphy can threaten to KO Shuckle with their STAB moves. Gyarados and Manaphy also do not fear Encore because of their Z-Moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Magnezone can KO Shuckle with their STAB moves. Mega Scizor will not mind the Knock Off, but it will have to be careful about using Swords Dance, since Shuckle may Encore it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types like Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Tyranitar can threaten to KO Shuckle with their STAB moves. Mega Diancie in particular can additionally bounce back any entry hazards that Shuckle tries to set up.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: After Shuckle's Mental Herb has been used, its non-existent offensive presence makes it vulnerable to stallbreakers such as Gliscor, Mew, and Heatran. However, Gliscor will risk getting its Toxic Orb removed from Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Due to having no reliable sustainability and being susceptible to Stealth Rock, Shuckle gets worn down extremely quickly. Status conditions like poison also add to this, since they can rack up damage against Shuckle over time.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Magic Bounce Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie are unaffected by any of Shuckle's utility moves and can bounce back its entry hazards. They also take little to no damage from Knock Off.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Entry Hazard Setter (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sticky Web allows Shuckle to support teammates such as Mega Pinsir and Scizor by slowing down grounded foes. For example, with Sticky Web up, Mega Pinsir can outpace Choice Scarf Victini and Scizor can outpace Heatran. Stealth Rock chips down foes when they switch in and renders Sturdy and Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Skarmory and Breloom useless. Encore prevents Shuckle from becoming setup bait by threatening setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Suicune. Toxic lets Shuckle cripple entry hazard removers that aren't immune to the status such as Zapdos and Staraptor. Knock Off is a great utility move that can cripple Pokemon that rely on their item against Bug-type teams, such as Air Balloon Heatran and Eviolite Porygon2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with an Impish nature allows Shuckle to set up entry hazards on threatening physical attackers such as Victini and Mega Lopunny. 248 HP EVs let Shuckle take minimal damage from Stealth Rock. Mental Herb allows Shuckle to bypass annoying Taunt and Encore users such as Deoxys-S and Mega Lopunny, respectively. Sturdy allows Shuckle to set at least one hazard against foes that could otherwise OHKO it, such as Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lead with Shuckle almost every game, as this set allows it to set entry hazards against almost every Pokemon as well as pressure hazard removers that are susceptible to Toxic. However, play skillfully against common Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, as they are generally good leads against Bug-type teams. You can lead with a Pokemon that can force the Magic Bounce user out before it can Mega Evolve and then double switch into Shuckle, which lets it safely set at least one entry hazard. Use Encore liberally against Pokemon like Tapu Bulu that could potentially be carrying setup moves, as Shuckle's bulk gives it multiple opportunities to set up hazards in most games. Although the most consistent plan with Shuckle is to set hazards and let it faint within a few turns, it can be wise to save Shuckle if given the opportunity, as it can be sacrificed for important momentum later on in a game. Play extremely aggressively around hazard removers such as Mantine by making double switches. For example, if you predict a Defog user like Mantine to switch in, double switch into a Pokemon such as Galvantula to maintain momentum. Be careful when setting Sticky Web if the opponent has a Pokemon with Contrary or Defiant like Serperior or Bisharp. Only set Sticky Web if you have a good way of beating these, as they can get out of control very quickly. Prioritize Sticky Web over Stealth Rock against offensive types such as Fighting and Bug. On the other hand, prioritize Stealth Rock over Sticky Web when playing against bulky teams or against types like Dragon and Flying that are not affected by Sticky Web.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Pinsir greatly appreciates Shuckle's Sticky Web support because it allows Mega Pinsir to outpace quick offensive threats to Bug such as Choice Scarf Victini. Choice Scarf Heracross and Buzzwole are good partners because they outpace most Pokemon with Sticky Web support. Heracross especially appreciates Sticky Web support, as it allows Heracross to outspeed and more reliably Pursuit trap Choice Scarf Victini. Heracross can also Pursuit trap entry hazard removers such as Latios and Zapdos, allowing teammates to keep up hazards more easily. Volcarona appreciates the support that Shuckle provides; Sticky Web allows +1 Volcarona to outpace Pokemon such as Swift Swim-boosted Kingdra and lets Volcarona set up on special attackers such as Gengar and Tapu Koko more easily, whereas Stealth Rock allows Volcarona to beat Pokemon such as Focus Sash Breloom and Alolan Golem. Scizor Pursuit traps hazard removers such as Latios and can also pressure other hazard removers such as Armaldo. Scizor can also give Shuckle a free opportunity to switch in with its slow U-turn. Armaldo and Forretress provide hazard removal support for Shuckle, which allows Shuckle to come in multiple times in a match to set entry hazards without having to worry about being chipped down by hazards such as Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock. Armaldo can also pressure Flying-type hazard removers like Mantine with Stone Edge, while Forretress can provide a secondary switch-in to Flying-type attacks and generate momentum with Volt Switch. Araquanid beats one of Shuckle's biggest problems, Mega Sableye, and it also pressures hazard removers like Latios and Rotom-H.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sticky Web reduces the foe's Speed stat by one stage upon them switching in, which is advantageous for teammates such as Terrakion and Nihilego. Stealth Rock wears the foe down each time they switch in, which is especially helpful in matchups such as Bug and Steel, breaking Sturdy on Pokemon such as Forretress and Skarmory. Encore allows Shuckle to disrupt setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Terrakion, and Mega Gallade as well as bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Hippowdon. Knock Off is used to remove Chansey and Porygon2's Eviolites as well as Choice Scarf from Greninja and Keldeo.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense with an Impish nature makes Shuckle as physically bulky as possible while minimizing Stealth Rock damage. Mental Herb allows Shuckle to bypass Taunt from Pokemon such as Cobalion and Deoxys-S for a single turn. Sturdy ensures that Shuckle always survives a hit from full health, allowing it to set up Sticky Web against wallbreakers like Keldeo and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In most matchups, it is important that Shuckle be led with immediately in order to set up Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, allowing offensive threats like Mega Diancie and Terrakion to sweep more effectively. Predicting when the foe will use a status move allows you to shut it down with Encore and switch an offensive threat in safely. Encore can also be useful for locking offensive Pokemon into a certain move. Examples include locking Mew into Psychic to safely allow Tyranitar to switch in and locking Latios into Draco Meteor so that Mega Diancie can safely come in. Due to Shuckle's Stealth Rock weakness and lack of recovery, it is also a good idea to switch in as the foe sets up Stealth Rock to avoid taking unnecessary damage. If Shuckle's Mental Herb is still intact, feel free to set up Stealth Rock or Sticky Web immediately against Taunt users like Cobalion, Heatran, and Gliscor. If the Mental Herb has already been used, it is a good idea to predict when your foe will Taunt and proceed to use Knock Off to remove their item. However, against Taunt users like Heatran and Cobalion, it is better to switch out on a predicted Taunt because Shuckle cannot severely damage them and they are more easily taken out by Terrakion or Mega Diancie. In matchups like Ground, Steel, and Psychic, it is best to prioritize setting up Sticky Web immediately as a means of outspeeding important threats like Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Mega Gallade. However, in matchups where Sticky Web isn't as helpful, such as Flying and Poison, it is better to set up Stealth Rock first. Many entry hazard removers like Mantine and Armaldo will capitalize on how passive Shuckle is, so try predicting when they will come in and double switch into an offensive threat like Tyranitar or Mega Diancie. Avoid poison as much as possible, since it will wear down Shuckle very fast and leave it unable to take hits and set up entry hazards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie can bounce back entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, both of which can wear down Shuckle rather quickly. In return, Shuckle's Sticky Web can allow Mega Diancie to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon like Terrakion and Heracross, making it a prime asset in the Fighting matchup. Tyranitar can set up sand for Shuckle with Sand Stream, allowing Shuckle to take more special hits. Tyranitar can also beat common Defoggers like Zapdos, Mantine, and Latios, which helps Shuckle keep up its hazards. In return, Sticky Web allows Tyranitar to outspeed and KO Pokemon like Nidoking, Diggersby, and Mew; the hazard also allows Choice Scarf Terrakion to outspeed Excadrill in sand as well as Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Gengar. Terrakion can also beat Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, which threaten Shuckle. Sticky Web can also give it the option to run Choice Band to function as an effective wallbreaker. Nihilego can beat Pokemon with Taunt such as Gliscor as well as physical walls like Skarmory and Mega Slowbro. It also benefits from Shuckle's Sticky Web to outspeed and remove Pokemon like Keldeo and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Omastar is a powerful setup sweeper that can beat Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp after a Shell Smash, both of which can severely threaten Shuckle by setting up and breaking through it with a Z-Move. Sticky Web allows Omastar to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Keldeo after a Shell Smash. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem are both able to beat Mega Scizor, a huge threat to Shuckle. Rhyperior can also blanket check other threats to Shuckle such as Terrakion and Excadrill, and Alolan Golem can trap Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn, both of which very easily wear down Shuckle. Cradily offers a Water immunity for Shuckle thanks to Storm Drain. In return, Shuckle can switch into Fighting-type attacks from Breloom and Infernape for Cradily. Shuckle providing Stealth Rock can also grant Cradily a free moveslot, and Cradily can do the same for Shuckle.</p> "

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <ul> <li>Heracross is an important asset to Fighting because of its valuable Bug-type STAB that allows it to deal with Psychic-types, high base Attack, and extensive movepool.</li> <li>Heracross is also blessed with two useful abilities in Guts and Moxie.</li> <li>The former allows Heracross to beat status users such as Mega Sableye, while the latter allows it to sweep when its checks are weakened</li> <li>Heracross also has a useful defensive typing, with a resistance to Grass, Ground, and Fighting.</li> <li>It also brings Knock Off utility, allowing it to remove items like Latios's Choice Scarf.</li> <li>However, Heracross's defenses are nothing special, and it is slower than other common Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Excadrill.</li> <li>It also has to rely on Megahorn to eliminate threats, which has middling accuracy in spite of its high Base Power.</li> <li>Heracross also faces competition from Buzzwole, another viable Bug / Fighting type that has higher Attack and better physical bulk. However, Heracross is faster, has stronger STAB moves, and has a more useful ability in Guts.</li> </ul> <h1>Bug</h1> <p>Heracross is useful on Bug-type teams as a revenge killer, with its high Attack stat and average Speed tier allowing it to effectively come in and revenge kill threats to Bug-type teams. With Choice Scarf, Heracross's Speed tier notably lets it outspeed Mega Lopunny and Charizard and secure KOs against them. However, its middle-ground Speed tier means it is outsped by a lot of other Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Latios, Victini, and Nihilego, though in several cases this can be remedied slightly by effective use of Sticky Web. Heracross's Fighting typing also allows it to hit types like Rock, Normal, and Steel that Bug-type teams commonly struggle to deal with, and its ability Moxie gives it a lot of potential to sweep teams late-game with its choice of coverage and STAB moves. However, Heracross is walled by common Pokemon such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Toxapex, which it fails to 2HKO and allows them to recover safely. Heracross also is quite weak to priority attackers, especially after Close Combat Defense drops. Status effects are also very threatening to Heracross, as paralysis and burn cripple its roles as a Choice Scarf revenge killer and potential late-game sweeper. Furthermore, Heracross can be easily checked due to its STAB moves having poor coverage individually. Mega Heracross's monstrous Attack stat and access to Swords Dance make it a formidable wallbreaker on Bug teams that can destroy many walls, such as Skarmory, Celesteela, Mantine, and Toxapex. It also has great bulk, giving it ample setup opportunities while simultaneously making it harder to revenge kill. However, its Speed is average at best, making it heavily reliant on Sticky Web support against more offensive teams. It also takes up the team's Mega slot, preventing the use of Mega Pinsir or Mega Scizor, both of which are arguably superior choices. The former boasts superior Speed, and the latter has a better defensive typing. Both also have STAB priority, which Bug otherwise lacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <ul> <li>Pursuit can be used over Knock Off to trap Victini that are attempting to switch, but it fails to OHKO Victini even at -1 Defense.</li> <li>Earthquake can be used over Stone Edge to target Toxapex and Doublade; however, it fails to 2HKO Toxapex and Doublade and also leaves Heracross unable to deal significant damage to Flying-types.</li> </ul> <h1>Bug</h1> <p>Guts is an alternate ability choice, as Heracross is so susceptible to status effects; this can especially help against teams that use Toxic Spikes but also allows Heracross to get burned without completely crippling it. However, this takes away its ability to sweep teams as easily, and Heracross still doesn't appreciate getting weakened by poison or burn or being slowed down by paralysis. For Mega Heracross, Bullet Seed always hits 5 times thanks to Skill Link and can be used instead of Earthquake to hit bulky Water- and Ground-types. It OHKOes Swampert and Gastrodon unboosted and OHKOes Hippowdon after Swords Dance. Substitute allows Mega Heracross to set up on more defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Gastrodon. However, Mega Heracross dislikes losing out on coverage.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini take minimal damage from all of Heracross's moves and threaten it out with their STAB moves. Clefable can also set up Calm Mind on it.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory: Skarmory hard counters Heracross, can set up entry hazards against it, and threatens it out with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Gliscor and Zapdos resist both of Heracross's STAB moves, although Zapdos fears the 2HKO from Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Doublade: Doublade takes minimal damage from all of Heracross's moves and sets up Swords Dance against it, although it hates having its Eviolite removed.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Defensive Poison-types, such as Crobat and Toxapex, resist both of Heracross's STAB types and can easily switch into Heracross, although Crobat fears Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Walls such as Alomomola and Hippowdon take little damage from Heracross's attacks and can recover their health with Wish and Slack Off, respectively, although neither like having their Leftovers removed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Although Fire-types fear Stone Edge, many of them, such as Volcarona, can take one of Heracross's other attacks and KO it with their STAB attacks. Even Torkoal can 2HKO it with Lava Plume, and its amazing bulk allows it to survive two Stone Edges.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Kyurem-B and Victini and priority users such as Dragonite can KO Heracross after some prior damage.</p> <h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types: Bulkier Flying-types such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Landorus-T are very difficult for Heracross to deal damage to, resisting both its STAB attacks and only taking neutral damage from its coverage moves; these Pokemon can easily switch in and tank hits from Heracross while recovering HP with Leftovers or Roost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types: Poison-types resist both of Heracross's STAB moves and take little damage from its coverage. Bulkier ones such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex are generally able to recover off any damage that Heracross does while threatening it with status or powerful attacks. However, they do need to be wary of Mega Heracross's Earthquake, especially after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Status and Entry Hazards: Burns and paralysis make Heracross severely worse at dealing damage to the opponent's team. Burn limits its attacking power, making it underwhelming and easy to switch into and recover on, whereas paralysis cripples its Speed tier, meaning it can easily be killed by Pokemon that now outspeed it and can no longer clean late-game with Moxie boosts.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Heracross doesn't have very good defensive stats, and they only get worse after Close Combat drops, meaning it can be easily revenge killed by Extreme Speed Dragonite and Bullet Punch Scizor. Mega Pinsir can also come in on Heracross and freely use Quick Attack to knock it out.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Heracross is at risk to many revenge killers, since Close Combat's defenses drops leave it susceptible to priority move users as well as Choice Scarf users, almost every relevant one of which is faster than Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types resist both of Mega Heracross's STAB moves and hit it for super effective damage. Clefable can 2HKO Mega Heracross with Moonblast and is never OHKOed by a +2 Rock Blast. Other common Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Mega Altaria outspeed and easily KO Mega Heracross.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Moxie Choice Scarf (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Heracross strongest Fighting-type STAB move, allowing it to hit several types that can be a problem for Bug-types, such as Rock, Steel, and Normal, for super effective damage and become a large asset to Bug by checking these types. Megahorn is Heracross's strongest Bug-type STAB attack and can be spammed against Psychic- and Dark-type teams. It can also threaten out Victini after a V-create. Stone Edge can hit Flying-types, which are very threatening to Bug-type teams. Pursuit is a useful choice for taking out weakened Pokemon that are forced out by Heracross; it is also vital for breaking Heatran's Air Balloon as it switches out in fear of Close Combat, leaving it susceptible to Ground-type attacks. Knock Off is a secondary choice because it can remove items from annoying Pokemon such as Toxapex and Skarmory, can deal a lot of damage to Ghost-types, and is also a stronger general purpose Dark-type attack for these types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Heracross uses maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature with a Choice Scarf to outspeed many threats such as non-Choice Scarf Latios, Mega Lopunny, and slower Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu. Maximum investment in Attack makes Heracross as strong as possible. Moxie boosts Heracross's Attack after it KOes a Pokemon, meaning it can easily sweep teams late-game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Heracross to revenge kill Pokemon threatening to Bug-types. It can knock out Steel-type threats like Heatran, KO Victini with Megahorn, and remove other Fire-types with Stone Edge. It is important to try to prevent Heracross from getting inflicted with status, as burn and paralysis cripple Heracross as a revenge killer and poison wears it down faster. Heracross has great potential to sweep late-game with Moxie, and a boost can allow it to break Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Hippowdon. Try not to let Heracross get worn down by entry hazards, weak attacks, and status, as they leave it in range of priority attacks from opposing Pokemon. Keep Heracross healthy in tougher matchups like Flying and Normal, as it can potentially sweep through these teams late-game with Stone Edge and Close Combat, respectively. Pursuit is a useful move to have in the Steel-type matchup because it allows Heracross to break Heatran's Air Balloon, potentially enabling Volcarona to sweep. Pursuit is also helpful against Psychic teams, as it can also be used to trap Choice Scarf Victini after a V-create because of the Speed drop. Use Knock Off to remove items from Pokemon that are annoying to Heracross or its teammates, such as Leftovers from Celesteela.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volcarona is a helpful ally to Heracross because it helps break Pokemon like Celesteela and Skarmory that easily tank Heracross's hits and can also weaken the opposing team for a late-game cleanup. Heracross also combines well with Volcarona to break Steel-type cores, as Pursuit breaking Heatran's Air Balloon allows it to be hit by Volcarona's Hidden Power Ground. Armaldo can get rid of entry hazards that wear Heracross down and also provide Stealth Rock to help it OHKO or 2HKO some Pokemon such as Dragonite by breaking Multiscale or potential Focus Sashes on other Pokemon. Forretress can also fit this role on teams if it is more suitable, as it learns Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin too and can also act as a slow pivot to bring in Heracross by using Volt Switch. Sticky Web support from Galvantula is important to Heracross because it allows Heracross to outspeed most grounded Pokemon, specifically Choice Scarf Victini after a V-create. Galvantula also helps against one of Heracross's checks, Toxapex, with strong Electric-type STAB moves and helps beat bulkier Flying-types that Heracross has trouble beating. An alternative Sticky Web setter that you could use is Araquanid, which is bulkier than Galvantula and is able to tank special attacks quite effectively while hitting back with Liquidation boosted by its ability Water Bubble. Araquanid can further be an effective choice due to its effective resistance to Fire-type attacks due to its secondary Water typing combined with its ability Water Bubble. Mega Pinsir can be used to take on Fighting-types that resist three of Heracross's attacks; Swords Dance sets are especially useful because they can break through bulky cores and weaken teams for Heracross to sweep late-game. Lastly, Scizor can be a useful ally for Heracross, as it can switch in on weaker Flying-type attacks like Quick Attack from Mega Pinsir and give Heracross a free switch in with a slow U-turn. Scizor also supports Heracross a lot with a strong priority attack in Bullet Punch, which deals a lot of damage to faster, frailer Pokemon, potentially KOing them so they do not threaten Heracross. Its typing is also useful because it can switch into incoming Psychic-type and Fairy-type attacks and effectively deal with Fairy-type Pokemon for Heracross.</p> "

        "name": "Wallbreaker (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Heracross's already massive Attack stat by two stages, letting it break through almost any wall. Close Combat is Mega Heracross's STAB move, letting it break through Normal-, Steel-, and Ice-types like Porygon2, Skarmory, and Mamoswine. Rock Blast has fantastic coverage with Close Combat, hitting the Bug- and Flying-types that resist the latter for super effective damage. Thanks to Skill Link, Rock Blast will always hit five times. It OHKOes Zapdos unboosted and defensive Staraptor after a Swords Dance. Earthquake is used in the last slot to hit the Poison-types that resist Mega Heracross's STAB moves, OHKOing Toxapex after a Swords Dance. If you have teammates that can reliably deal with Toxapex, Pin Missile can be used instead of Earthquake as an alternate STAB move that will always hit 5 times thanks to Skill Link. It OHKOes defensive Mew, and after a Swords Dance, it OHKOes Mega Sableye, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used to enable Mega Heracross to outrun Mega Lopunny with Sticky Web down, as well as to outrun and OHKO defensively inclined base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as defensive Staraptor and defensive Mew, before they have a chance to OHKO with Brave Bird or cripple Mega Heracross with a burn. Maximum Attack investment gives Mega Heracross as much raw power as possible. Moxie is the most useful ability before Mega Evolving, as Attack boosts Heracross might gain will transfer over. Skill Link is Mega Heracross's only ability post-Mega Evolution, which allows Rock Blast and Pin Missile to always hit 5 times.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Heracross is most effective early- or mid-game, weakening or outright removing defensive cores so that its teammates can clear up later in the match. Try to set up Swords Dance on Pokemon that don't stay in on Mega Heracross, such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Tyranitar, or Pokemon that can't do much back to it, such as Mandibuzz. As Mega Heracross's Attack is already so massive, setting up Swords Dance isn't always necessary against teams that are inherently weak to Fighting, such as Normal and Dark, as Mega Heracross can already 2HKO most walls those teams have without a boost. Do not Mega Evolve Heracross until you need the power, bulk, or Skill Link, as Moxie allows you to potentially pick up Attack boosts without having to use Swords Dance. If paired with Scizor, you could also bluff the Choice Scarf set, as your opponent might think you're running Mega Scizor instead. As Mega Heracross needs high health to reliably wallbreak, avoid switching it into attacks if possible. Don't be too hasty switching into walls either, as it hates being badly poisoned, paralyzed, or burned. Bringing it in via U-turn or Volt Switch or after a teammate has fainted is often the preferred method.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Galvantula can set Sticky Web, which is essential for Mega Heracross to outrun everything slower than Zeraora. In addition to setting the entry hazard, it can use its STAB Thunder to check Flying-types for Mega Heracross and 2HKO Toxapex, which can give Mega Heracross problems if it chooses to forgo Earthquake. Armaldo is another very useful teammate, as the Stealth Rock it sets allows Mega Heracross to OHKO Skarmory with a +2 Close Combat, as well as guarantee the OHKO on Mega Venusaur with a +2 Pin Missile. It can also remove opposing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and help check the Fire- and Flying-types Mega Heracross fears, such as Mega Charizard Y and Tornadus-T. Scizor is a very useful teammate that can beat most of the Fairy-types that Mega Heracross is weak to and bring Mega Heracross in safely with U-turn while also Pursuit trapping Latios, Latias, and -1 Victini, which can all OHKO Mega Heracross. Scizor appreciates Mega Heracross's ability to weaken or remove physical walls, such as Skarmory, Toxapex, and Hippowdon. Volcarona is a potent setup sweeper that pairs well with Mega Heracross, as they can weaken and remove each other's checks. Mega Heracross can remove Chansey, Alolan Muk, Mantine, and Toxapex, all of which can stop Volcarona from sweeping. In return, Volcarona can set up on defensive Mew and Mega Sableye, both of which can cripple Mega Heracross with Will-O-Wisp if it hasn't boosted yet. Choice Scarf Buzzwole is a great partner for Mega Heracross, as the two can wear down each other's checks, such as Mega Sableye, Skarmory, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Araquanid can absorb Will-O-Wisps aimed at Mega Heracross courtesy of Water Bubble, set up Sticky Web to negate Mega Heracross's average Speed, and check Fire-types for Mega Heracross, such as Mega Charizard Y and Blacephalon. In return, Mega Heracross can check the bulky Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, that wall Araquanid. Lastly, Forretress can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes to give Mega Heracross an easier time wallbreaking, remove them with Rapid Spin, and bring Mega Heracross in safely with a slow Volt Switch.</p> "

  "Piloswine": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ice</h1> <p>Piloswine is one of Ice's best Stealth Rock setters due to its great utility as a specially defensive tank with the Eviolite. With its ability Thick Fat, Piloswine takes neutral damage from Fire-type attacks, allowing it to check Fire-types like Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Blacephalon, and Volcarona. Piloswine's Ground typing lets it beat powerful offensive Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Gengar, and Tapu Koko. This typing also grants it a neutrality to Rock-type attacks, letting it switch into Nihilego with ease, which is extremely important since Nihilego is one of the biggest threats to Ice teams. Piloswine's solid Attack stat gives it a decent offensive presence, preventing it from being completely passive. Unfortunately, Piloswine is largely susceptible to Knock Off, since without the Eviolite, its Special Defense is very lackluster. It faces competition from Mamoswine as a Stealth Rock setter, which has a higher Attack and Speed stat to make it a more formidable offensive presence. However, when used together, since Piloswine fills the role as a Stealth Rock setter, Mamoswine is free to run a different set such as Choice Scarf to operate as a revenge killer. Piloswine's offensive presence is passable at best, leaving it easily walled by Pokemon such as Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Sableye. With no reliable recovery, Piloswine is often worn down very quickly between entry hazards and status.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ice</h1> <p>Stone Edge is an option over Rock Slide for extra power, guaranteeing the OHKO against Mega Charizard Y. However, Rock Slide's consistency is generally more valuable. Icicle Crash is an option as a stronger Ice-type STAB move that has a high chance of OHKOing Gliscor and Landorus-T, as well as 2HKOing Zapdos. However, Rock Slide's important coverage is far more valuable.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ice</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Terrakion, Mega Gallade, and Mega Lopunny threaten to OHKO Piloswine with their Fighting-type STAB moves. However, Terrakion can’t switch into an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Greninja and Keldeo are able to either 2HKO or OHKO Piloswine with their STAB moves.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is used to chip away at foes each time they switch in, which is especially helpful in problematic matchups like against Fire and Bug. Earthquake is Piloswine's most powerful STAB move, allowing it to beat Rock- and Fire-types like Nihilego, Torkoal, and Heatran. Rock Slide is important coverage in order to OHKO Fire-types such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Toxic is an option to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Porygon2, Mega Slowbro, and Torkoal, while Roar can phaze setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor, Mew, and Azumarill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Defense with a Careful nature is used to make Piloswine as specially defensive as possible. 12 EVs in Attack are used to always OHKO Volcarona with Rock Slide. The rest are invested into HP to maximize its overall bulk. Eviolite is used to further increase Piloswine's defenses. Thick Fat grants Piloswine a neutrality to Fire-type attacks, letting it beat Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In most matchups, leading with Piloswine is important to get up Stealth Rock as soon as possible to make threatening the opposing team easier for offensive Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Alolan Sandslash. If a setup sweeper such as Mega Scizor or Azumarill is granted a free switch, using Roar is best to phaze them immediately before they set up. Try switching in Piloswine frequently against special attackers like Nihilego and Tapu Koko; since Piloswine can often force them out, it can take advantage of this by setting up Stealth Rock as they switch. Alternatively, a double switch can also be made into Kyurem-B as a means of threatening the rest of the Poison or Electric team respectively. Avoid Knock Off users, since Piloswine has mediocre bulk without the Eviolite. Avoid status conditions, notably poison and burn, as much as possible, since they will be wearing down Piloswine each turn. Because of this, it's important to keep entry hazards like Toxic Spikes away as often as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B is a fantastic wallbreaker that can break through Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela that wall Piloswine. In return, Piloswine can set up Stealth Rock to allow Kyurem-B to wallbreak more effectively, as well as wear down defensive checks like Porygon2 with Toxic. Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil to further increase Piloswine's survivability and check threatening Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo. In return, Piloswine can check Fire- and Poison-types like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Nihilego. Avalugg and Rotom-F can switch into physical attacks for Piloswine, forming an effective defensive core. They also both fill the role of an entry hazard remover to keep Piloswine healthy. Avalugg can switch into Fighting-types like Terrakion and Infernape, while Rotom-F can cripple threatening physical attackers like Mega Scizor with Will-O-Wisp, and pivot with Volt Switch to bring Piloswine in safely. Mamoswine is free to fill the role of a Choice Scarf revenge killer and cleaner to check Knock Off users such as Krookodile and Weavile with Piloswine filling that of a Stealth Rock setter. Cloyster is a great late-game sweeper that appreciates Piloswine's Stealth Rock wearing down opposing teams in order to sweep more effectively. Lapras is capable of checking setup sweepers that have priority such as bulky Mega Scizor and Azumarill and with Water Absorb also offers a Water immunity for Piloswine. Alolan Sandslash is a fast cleaner that can check threatening wallbreakers like Kyurem-B, Landorus, and Victini. It also has access to hazard removal with Rapid Spin in order to keep Piloswine healthy. Weavile can trap Psychic-types like Victini and Latios with Pursuit, as well as remove items with Knock Off. In return, Piloswine can check faster special attackers like Choice Scarf Nihilego and Tapu Koko, which threaten to OHKO Weavile.</p> "

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Mantine's amazing Special Defense along with its access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost makes it a specially defensive wall that is extremely easy to fit on Water teams. It gets access to other utility moves such as Defog and Toxic while also having one of the most spammable moves in the game, Scald, as a STAB move. Its typing provides a key neutrality to Grass-type moves and an immunity to Ground-type moves, something Water teams really appreciate due to their general lack of Pokemon that resist Ground-type moves. However, Mantine suffers from a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves and is very passive, often resulting in a huge loss of momentum whenever it comes in. It faces competition from Empoleon as a Defog user, as the latter can compress two roles on one teamslot due to its access to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, being weak to Stealth Rock makes it hard for Mantine to actually switch in repeatedly to use Defog. Finally, Mantine has a low Defense stat, forcing it to rely on teammates to take on physical wallbreakers.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Mantine is a great special wall on balance and stall Flying teams thanks to its high Special Defense stat and its excellent Water typing allowing it to take Ice-type moves neutrally, taking pressure off Pokemon such as Celesteela that would otherwise need to deal with them. Its ability Water Absorb also makes it a great counter to heavy-hitting Water-type Pokemon such as Kingdra and Keldeo. Its utility moves in Roost and Defog allow it to take pressure off teammates such as Zapdos by absorbing neutral hits for them and allowing Zapdos to run Substitute and Toxic rather than Defog. Furthermore, the option to use Toxic or Haze allows Mantine to cripple opposing Pokemon, limiting their switches, and prevent setup Pokemon such as Volcarona from beating the team. Access to a spammable move in Scald as well makes Mantine very dangerous to even physical Pokemon trying to take advantage of its lack of physical bulk such as Scizor and Mega Gallade, as it has a chance to burn and cripple them. However, Mantine's 4x weakness to Electric-type moves is detrimental to Flying-type teams, as it does not help in the matchup against Electric, and Pokemon such as Keldeo can act as lures with Hidden Power Electric. Mantine's mediocre Defense stat also means it is forced out by strong physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, leaving it pressured while Defogging. Mantine is extremely passive and offers little to the team in terms of offense, so it is dead weight on more balanced and offensive teams outside of Scald.</p> ",

However, Rock-type Pokemon such as Terrakion and Tyranitar do not switch into Mantine, as they fear being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: The likes of Dragonite and Kyurem-B find it really easy to force out Mantine, as Mantine cannot risk taking a hit from these Pokemon due to its underwhelming Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Although Mantine has Haze for special attackers trying to set up, it cannot deal with them all. Calm Mind + Thunderbolt Mega Latios can easily set up on and deal with Mantine, as can physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, Garchomp, and Bisharp, with the latter also being able to come in on Defog and get an automatic boost. However, physical attackers do risk being burned when trying to set up on Mantine.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Mantine loses one-on-one versus the walls of the tier. A couple of examples include Chansey and Mandibuzz.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald prevents Mantine from becoming complete setup bait for stallbreakers while also limiting physical attackers from switching in freely by threatening them with a chance to burn. Defog lets Mantine fulfill its role as an entry hazard remover, supporting the rest of the team. Reliable recovery in the form of Roost is incredibly important for Mantine, as it needs some sort of sustain to combat most special attackers. Furthermore, it lets Mantine remain healthy throughout the match to Defog away entry hazards. Haze allows Mantine to switch into and stop setup sweepers, such as Volcarona and Mew. However, Toxic allows Mantine to hinder annoyances such as opposing Mantine and Porygon2 while still giving Mantine the ability to threaten some setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers gives Mantine residual recovery every turn, letting it perform its job as a specially defensive wall and Defog user more reliably. Water Absorb, although not particularly useful on a Water team, grants it an immunity to Water-type moves. The EVs and nature maximize Mantine's special bulk while also letting it outspeed Adamant Azumarill in order to Haze it after it uses Belly Drum.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try switching Mantine in on the turn the foe goes for Stealth Rock in order to avoid taking unnecessary entry hazard damage. Mantine hates Toxic; even if it isn't guaranteed that the foe has Toxic, switching out to scout for it is usually the safer play because Mantine gets completely crippled when poisoned. Use Roost whenever possible when Mantine isn't at maximum HP because Mantine has to constantly switch in on Stealth Rock to Defog it away or on special attackers to wall them. If it isn't at maximum HP, it may become much harder for Mantine to perform its jobs. However, if Mantine has taken no damage, spamming Scald is a good play, as it limits the number of Pokemon that can switch in due to its chance to burn. Against foes like Volcarona, Mantine should be switched in immediately to prevent its teammates from taking unnecessary damage and to get rid of Stealth Rock. Although Mantine's typing grants it a plethora of resistances, it leaves it with a glaring 4x weakness to Electric-type moves. It should thus avoid staying in on Electric-types or even Pokemon that may carry Electric-type coverage. Against a potential setup sweeper, it is sometimes wiser to spam Haze in order to prevent it from setting up and hitting Mantine with a boosted hit instead of a regular one. This depends on the situation, however. If the foe can threaten Mantine with an unboosted hit and Mantine is needed to counter a Pokemon, then try switching into a more appropriate counter instead of risking Mantine.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The utility that Mantine provides makes it easy to fit on most balance and stall teams, but it is generally a bit too passive for offensive Water teams. Swampert is one of the best partners for Mantine. It takes on most physical attackers, Electric-types, and Rock-types that threaten Mantine, while Mantine takes on special attackers and Grass-types wonderfully. Toxapex is another defensive wall that complements Mantine well by taking on physical attackers. Furthermore, the two can share their role as a Grass-type neutrality and prevent the other from being pressured and worn down too quickly. They also both often carry Haze, which can allow one or the other to run another utility move instead. Mantine's 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks forces at least one immunity to them to be run alongside it. Lanturn and Quagsire are two Pokemon that work excellently in tandem with Mantine. Lanturn gets access to Heal Bell, which can save Mantine from status conditions like Toxic, while Quagsire can take on setup sweepers like Dragonite. Mantine also supports them, being able to take Grass-type moves. Wallbreakers like Manaphy, Greninja, and Mega Sharpedo can support Mantine greatly by being able to take out annoying stallbreakers or walls that it can't break through. Sap Sipper Azumarill can take Grass-type moves, relieving Mantine from its duty as a Grass-type neutrality while also taking on threats like Tapu Bulu. Another excellent physically defensive wall to take on physical attackers is Slowbro. It also appreciates Mantine's ability to take Grass-type moves, as it usually can't do much to most of them. Mega Slowbro functions even more effectively with Mantine due to its increased mixed bulk and decent offensive presence with Calm Mind. Alomomola supports Mantine by providing recovery in the form of Wish; this makes it much easier to bring Mantine in, especially when Stealth Rock is up. Tapu Fini is another excellent teammate for Mantine. The latter can take up the role of a Defog user, allowing Tapu Fini to run more of an offensive or stallbreaking set. Finally, Empoleon appreciates Mantine's immunity to Ground-type moves, and both can take the role of a Defog user, allowing one of them to run a different move over Defog.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Defog is massively important on Flying-type teams, and as a bulky Pokemon with high sustainability, Mantine puts it to good use. Unfortunately, as Mantine has little offensive presence, choosing to Defog can allow physical attackers to grab momentum, as Pokemon such as Bisharp can come in and gain a boost from it, and Mega Pinsir can start setting up and force Mantine out. Scald is the most spammable offensive move that Mantine has, enabling it to threaten physical attackers with a burn and preventing it from becoming bait for stallbreakers and Taunt users. Roost is necessary on Mantine, as it gives it more longevity in battle and can let it completely shut down special attackers such as Greninja and Mega Charizard Y. Haze is used to stop Mantine from becoming setup fodder, with Mantine having the ability to take a boosted Z-Move from Volcarona and remove its boosts. Mantine can also live a hit from Z-Celebrate Victini and can outspeed Z-Belly Drum Azumarill and can Haze both of them. Toxic is an option to cripple Pokemon that are unable to hit Mantine for much damage as well as bulkier Pokemon that Scald has little effect versus such as other Water-type Pokemon and other bulkier Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Mandibuzz. However, Haze is a better option in general, as it has more use on balanced Flying teams, being able to shut down threats that can boost their stats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers allows Mantine to stay at high health each turn; this helps when using Haze against potential setup sweepers and lets it switch into Stealth Rock more often over time, allowing it to Defog more efficiently. Even though Mantine already resists Water-type attacks, Water Absorb allows Mantine to take on Water-type Pokemon that are looking to hit other Pokemon on the team for heavy damage such as Keldeo and Kingdra. 160 Special Defense EVs and maximum EVs in HP allow Mantine to act as a great mixed wall, having a gigantic Special Defense stat and taking physical attacks from Pokemon that struggle with to hit it for super effective damage such as Scizor fairly well too. This also prevents it from being completely trapped by Pursuit trappers like Alolan Muk. 96 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Azumarill and remove its boosts with Haze; 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD should be the EV spread if using Toxic, as Mantine does not need the Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make good use of Haze when facing Pokemon such as Volcarona and Mew, as they are not powerful enough to overwhelm Mantine, so switching into them and using Haze is the best option to not let them get out of hand. Although Mew can OHKO Mantine at +2 with a Z-Move, Mantine at least stops Mew from being able to raise its Speed as well, making it easier to revenge kill. Make use of Water Absorb; do not let the rest of your team take unnecessary damage when Mantine can indefinitely check opposing Water-types. Mantine's great Water typing also lets it take hits from Pokemon with Ice-type coverage, meaning Pokemon such as Greninja and Latios find it much harder to break Flying-type teams. Try to keep Mantine healthy so that it can Defog periodically throughout the battle, as its teammates, such as Mega Charizard Y, rely on Stealth Rock being removed. Know when to use Toxic and when to use Scald; burning a Pokemon such as Porygon2 will be less beneficial for your team than using Toxic, whereas getting a Scald burn on physical attackers such as Terrakion and Tapu Bulu is much more beneficial to cripple them throughout the match. Mantine wants to avoid status, as it can be easily worn down with hazard damage and Toxic over time. If you are not using Toxic, be aware that Mantine loses one-on-one to other walls that can viably run Toxic. Do not try to beat Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Mandibuzz without Toxic, as they can status and stall out Mantine easily. Pick the correct times to use Defog, as Defogging whilst in the face of setup Pokemon or heavy hitters can result in losing multiple Pokemon. Mantine should also not Defog while Bisharp is out or if the opponent has the ability to switch Bisharp in. Try to get a Defog off while Mantine is in on a Pokemon it completely shuts down such as Mega Charizard Y or Greninja. Similarly, take advantage of Stealth Rock setters that Mantine beats; Pokemon such as Skarmory and Hippowdon are easily checked by Mantine, and switching in on them right away allows it to Defog without taking unnecessary hazard damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mantine is a great Defogger and switch-in to Ice-type attacks, making it a great teammate for most Flying-type Pokemon. Landorus and Landorus-T are both good offensive checks to Electric-type Pokemon. Both offer a huge amount of offensive pressure, forcing out a lot of Pokemon that threaten Mantine with their STAB Earth Power and Earthquake. Landorus-T also works as a check to physical attackers with Intimidate and its great bulk. Zapdos is a good teammate for Mantine, as it can deal with Water-types that Mantine cannot do much against, such as Toxapex, and offers super effective STAB attacks as well as Substitute and Toxic to beat bulkier Pokemon that could Toxic stall Mantine. Zapdos also has the ability to deal with most Electric-type Pokemon, such as opposing Defog Zapdos and Tapu Koko. Skarmory acts as a polar opposite to Mantine, being a great physical wall that can take on Pokemon that scare Mantine out with Rock-type attacks as well as act as another form of entry hazard removal to take pressure off of Mantine. Celesteela is a mixed wall that works well with Mantine, as it threatens all Rock-type Pokemon other than Stakataka with Heavy Slam and has Leech Seed to wear down bulky Pokemon. Gliscor is a good stallbreaker on Flying-type teams, able to shut down Pokemon that rely on recovery with Taunt and whittle down bulky Pokemon that can usually take on Mantine such as Chansey. As Mantine struggles to deal with walls if it isn't running Toxic, Dragonite pairs well with it to offer great wallbreaking power, being able to deal with Chansey and Toxapex. Dragonite also appreciates Mantine's Defog, keeping its Multiscale intact. Mega Charizard Y is another great wallbreaker with its very high Special Attack, and it can help break walls that Mantine cannot touch such as Porygon2. Mantine can also Defog well for Mega Charizard Y to safely come in. Mega Aerodactyl can Pursuit trap Pokemon that would usually threaten Mantine such as Victini.</p> "

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Skarmory is the premier physical wall on Flying teams because of its high Defense stat allowing it to take powerful physical attacks with ease. It has an amazing support movepool that includes Defog, Whirlwind, and Stealth Rock. Skarmory also has a handy resistance to Dragon-type attacks, allowing it to check powerful Dragon-types such as Salamence and Garchomp. Along with this, it has a key neutrality to Ice-type attacks, which allows it to counter powerful Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Weavile. Skarmory also has reliable recovery in Roost, giving it sustainability, which allows it to counter physical attackers such as Salamence and Weavile while giving it more opportunities to remove entry hazards with Defog. However, Skarmory has a mediocre Special Defense stat, meaning that it often needs to switch out against strong special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Greninja. It is also susceptible to common Electric- and Fire-type attacks, making it somewhat difficult to preserve Skarmory's HP. It also doesn't have much of an offensive presence because of its average Attack stat, which leaves it susceptible to Taunt users such as Mega Gyarados and Smeargle.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>With the highest physical bulk of any available Ground-immune Pokemon and longevity thanks to Roost, Skarmory finds a spot on almost every Steel team as a premier physical wall. Its Flying typing doesn't just let it check Ground-types; a powerful STAB Brave Bird and a neutrality to Fighting make Skarmory a reliable Fighting check as well. Skarmory also packs much utility in the form of Spikes and Stealth Rock, allowing it to provide whichever entry hazard the team needs most. It can also run Whirlwind to phaze sweepers and even Defog to remove Sticky Web and stop Spikes stacking. What makes using these utility moves even easier is Sturdy, which allows Skarmory to be a last-minute check to setup sweepers or the best suicide lead that is capable of setting multiple layers of hazards and using Taunt. Unfortunately, Skarmory has rather below average HP and Special Defense, meaning most special attackers lay waste to it. Celesteela, sporting much better mixed bulk, thus finds a way to compete with Skarmory and can take on the Ground-immune teamslot with its Assault Vest set on more offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p>Suicide lead Skarmory with Brave Bird / Stealth Rock / Spikes / Taunt can be used, but Aerodactyl is a better suicide lead on most Flying-type teams. Toxic can be used to better deal with bulkier Pokemon such as Swampert and Chansey, but Skarmory usually doesn't have room for it. Spikes can be used over Stealth Rock or Defog to allow Skarmory to pressure Fairy- and Normal-type teams, but most Flying-type teams have greater need for a Defog or Stealth Rock user. Shed Shell makes it so Skarmory cannot be trapped by Magnezone, but the passive recovery of Leftovers is better.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Defog allows Skarmory to provide entry hazard removal, but Excadrill often carries Rapid Spin, making this utility redundant for most teams. If Excadrill wishes to run Toxic, though, it is recommended to carry Defog to remove Sticky Web. Toxic is a decent utility option that cripples both walls and setup sweepers but is difficult to justify over Whirlwind for fear of the most threatening setup sweepers such as Porygon-Z. Shed Shell is a good option for teams that fear trappers such as Magnezone and Alolan Golem. Suicide leads can opt to run Focus Sash + Weak Armor to be even faster than Salac Berry sets and avoid being KOed by Teravolt Kyurem-B, but it's less reliable in general. Mental Herb is another possibility to beat opposing Taunt users, but makes Skarmory less useful in most matchups.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Xurkitree can switch into Skarmory and KO it with their Electric-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Trappers: Trappers such as Magnezone and Alolan Golem can trap and KO Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Torkoal, and Victini KO Skarmory with their Fire-type attacks.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird is used to hit Fighting-, Bug-, and Grass-types such as Keldeo, Heracross, and Breloom while also giving Skarmory an offensive presence. Iron Head allows Skarmory to hit Ice-, Fairy-, and Rock-types such as Weavile, Clefable, and Tyranitar. Roost allows Skarmory to recover its HP, giving it sustainability. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze setup sweepers such as Salamence and Landorus-T. Defog enables Skarmory to remove Stealth Rock for Flying-type teams, forming an excellent hazard control core with Mantine. Stealth Rock is an option to pressure Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-types that threaten Flying-type teams, but Skarmory is outclassed by other Stealth Rock users such as Gliscor, Landorus, and Landorus-T, and opting for Stealth Rock over Defog in the last slot forces teammate Zapdos to run Defog.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>224 HP EVs allow Skarmory to always be at full HP after two turns of Leftovers recovery after Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Defense investment along with an Impish nature ensures that Skarmory is as physically bulky as possible. Sturdy allows Skarmory to survive any hit if it is at full health. Leftovers allows Skarmory to recover a bit of its HP each turn. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can be used to punish users of contact attacks such as U-turn Landorus-T and Mega Beedrill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If Skarmory is running Defog and Stealth Rock is up on your side, it is usually best to use Defog to remove it as soon possible so that Skarmory's teammates don't take unnecessary damage. It is usually best to set up Stealth Rock as early as possible to pressure Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types. Preserve Skarmory's HP because it needs to be at full HP to check powerful physical attackers such as Mamoswine and Garchomp. If Skarmory is using Rocky Helmet, it is a great idea to switch it in against U-turn users such as Landorus-T and Jirachi to rack up residual damage. Skarmory should avoid getting burned, as burn halves Skarmory's average Attack stat and leaves it with no offensive presence while also negating its Leftovers recovery. If Stealth Rock is up on the opponent's side, it is typically a good idea to spam Whirlwind to potentially force in a Pokemon that is weak to Stealth Rock. Be extremely careful against trappers such as Magnezone because they can easily trap and KO Skarmory. Skarmory should be careful against Pokemon that tend to carry special Fire-type coverage such as Garchomp and Tyranitar. It should also be kept away from special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos because of its poor Special Defense stat. Skarmory should immediately phaze setup sweepers such as Salamence and Scizor, as they can KO Skarmory if they acquire multiple boosts. Use pivots such as Volt Switch Zapdos and U-turn Landorus-T to allow Skarmory to use Defog safely. Skarmory should switch into physical attackers such as Mamoswine and Heracross because it can easily set up hazards or use Defog on them while also beating them one-on-one.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mantine can take special Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Skarmory while also being a reliable Defog user, forming a hazard control core. Zapdos can take Electric-type attacks for Skarmory and run a Substitute + Toxic set to cripple bulky Pokemon that wall Skarmory such as Chansey and Porygon2. Zapdos and Mantine can also take special attacks for Skarmory, while Skarmory can take physical attacks for them. Stealth Rock users such as Gliscor, Landorus, and Landorus-T allow Skarmory to run Defog. Landorus and Mega Charizard Y appreciate Stealth Rock from Skarmory because it allows them to net certain KOs, and the latter also appreciates Defog support. However, Mega Charizard Y sets up sun with Drought, meaning that Skarmory can be KOed by Fire Punch Dragonite and Fire Blast Garchomp. Landorus-T can use U-turn to bring in Skarmory safely and is immune to Electric-type attacks. Gliscor has an Electric-type immunity while also being able an effective stallbreaker because of Taunt. Skarmory can take Ice-type attacks for Gliscor in return. Salamence and Gyarados appreciate Stealth Rock from Skarmory because it enables them to sweep with ease. Togekiss can revenge kill threats such as Greninja and Infernape, while Skarmory can set up Stealth Rock to make it much easier for Togekiss to sweep late-game. Dragonite appreciates Stealth Rock from Skarmory because it lets it pick off threats such as Greninja with Extreme Speed. Dragonite also appreciates Defog support because it preserves Dragonite's Multiscale.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird hits Fighting-types for super effective damage and prevents Skarmory from being complete Taunt bait. Spikes wears down grounded Pokemon when they switch in and outdamages Stealth Rock against Fighting- and Ground-types in particular. If no other teammate can provide Stealth Rock, Skarmory should use it instead of Spikes. However, it prefers to use Spikes in most cases for the greater utility and exclusivity. Roost provides reliable recovery, which allows Skarmory to effectively serve as a wall and Ground-immune Pokemon. Whirlwind prevents setup sweepers from easily setting up on Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item for the minor healing every turn helping keep Skarmory healthy. However, Rocky Helmet is an option in order to suicide check physical threats like Mega Charizard X or punish the likes of Choice Scarf Terrakion. 224 HP EVs allow Skarmory to restore Sturdy after taking Stealth Rock damage by healing over two turns with Leftovers. If using Rocky Helmet, though, maximum HP investment should be used instead. 32 Special Defense EVs combine with the HP investment to prevent Choice Scarf Kyurem-B's Ice Beam from 2HKOing Skarmory and allow Skarmory to take some weaker special attacks more easily. Maximum Defense EVs are used to make Skarmory one of the bulkiest physical walls in the metagame. Sturdy guarantees Skarmory can use Whirlwind or Brave Bird to check most setup sweepers like Porygon-Z and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory should pivot into physical attackers whenever possible to get opportunities to set up entry hazards. Make sure to use Roost as often as is needed after switching in to keep it healthy enough to switch in over and over, as that is its most important role. Do be careful of attackers like Garchomp, which often carry Fire Blast specifically to nail Skarmory on the switch, though. Against setup sweepers, Skarmory should try to switch in immediately to use Whirlwind, but if they can take Skarmory on, it may be better to preserve Sturdy by getting it in safely. While Skarmory has almost no way to touch opposing walls directly, it can set up all three layers of Spikes against them with almost no fear. As a result, Skarmory should look to switch into passive Pokemon like Chansey in order to use Spikes freely. After setting up hazards, Whirlwind is most useful to rack up damage as the opponent tries to send in a check. Whirlwind should also be used whenever you predict a trapper to switch in to rack up crucial damage, as Skarmory cannot beat any trapper one-on-one. Be careful of Taunt users; while Skarmory's Attack is not bad, Brave Bird fails to do much to most stallbreakers, and it should often switch out to a check when against them. In a similar fashion, Taunt Gyarados can potentially set up on a weakened Skarmory. Roost temporarily removes Skarmory's Flying typing, so watch out for slow Ground- and Fighting-types that can take advantage of this property such as Hippowdon and Bewear.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types in general almost always need Skarmory's help to take Ground-type attacks and check Fighting-types safely. Heatran is a mandatory teammate for Skarmory, as it is immune to the Fire-type attacks that Skarmory is so fearful of. It carries Stealth Rock most of the time, which makes it easier for Skarmory to use Spikes. Ferrothorn supports Skarmory along with Heatran by covering both Water- and Electric-types such as Kingdra and Tapu Koko, forming a powerful Steel-type defensive core. If Skarmory carries Spikes, Ferrothorn can freely use more useful utility moves. Celesteela can be used as a supplementary Ground-immune Pokemon that takes on Landorus and Nidoking to some extent in support of Skarmory for balance- and stall-like teams. Mega Scizor's great physical bulk and neutrality to both Ground and Fighting mean it can take on some of Skarmory's burdens. Thanks to the threat of Swords Dance and the power of U-turn, Mega Scizor is also very capable of forcing switches and making the most out of Skarmory's Spikes. Choice Scarf Excadrill pressures Fire teams with its EdgeQuake coverage and breaks Electric teams with Mold Breaker Earthquake. It can also use Toxic to beat Mega Sableye.</p> "

        "name": "Suicide Lead (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>As a suicide lead that can reliably set multiple layers of entry hazards, Skarmory should use both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Taunt stops Defoggers and prevents other leads from setting their own hazards. Brave Bird deals considerable damage and allows Skarmory to cause itself to faint, blocking spinners from erasing its hard work.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sturdy lets Skarmory survive any one attack to set up extra entry hazards. Salac Berry allows Skarmory to outspeed many leads that would otherwise be faster in order to get off a surprise second move. Maximum Speed investment and a Speed-boosting nature make Skarmory as fast as possible and allow it to use Taunt on Pokemon as fast as defensive Zapdos. A Hasty nature is used along with 0 IVs in the defensive stats in order to activate Sturdy as reliably as possible to eat Salac Berry and suicide with Brave Bird. The rest of the EVs are put in Attack to make Skarmory's Brave Bird deal as much damage as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory should be used as a lead in almost every situation. However, against Mega Sableye and defensive spinners, Skarmory should be saved for later in the battle instead, as it cannot reliably set entry hazards against them. Unless the opposing team resists Rock, Stealth Rock is often the better entry hazard to use first. Additional layers of Spikes have diminishing returns, so it's best to have one of each in most cases over two layers of Spikes. While it is nice to have many layers, make absolutely sure to use Taunt on opposing hazard users and Defoggers. Brave Bird should only be used when Skarmory is ready to suicide in almost every situation, as it otherwise breaks Sturdy and makes the defenseless Skarmory vulnerable to being KOed. If the opposing team has very reliable hazard control, it may be better to keep Skarmory around to set hazards again later instead of suiciding early.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicide lead Skarmory should only be used on hyper offense teams that appreciate the entry hazards it can set. Taunt Heatran is useful for keeping the hazards on the opponent's side of the field. It also takes out most Defoggers and spinners with Magma Storm and Earth Power. Because Skarmory intends to suicide in most cases, Air Balloon Heatran is very useful for a temporary Ground-immune Pokemon. Mold Breaker + Toxic Excadrill is almost necessary for its ability to beat Mega Sableye, which counters this set. Bisharp can use Defiant to discourage Defoggers from removing Skarmory's hazards. Similarly, Doublade spinblocks and sets up on most spinners. Both are great setup sweepers that can take advantage of free turns. Assault Vest Celesteela is a reliable Ground-immune option that can support the team after Skarmory faints.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Kingdra's access to Swift Swim and a strong STAB move in Hydro Pump makes it one of the best wallbreakers and sweepers under rain, heavily denting most Pokemon in combination with its STAB Draco Meteor. Although this STAB combination is resisted by many Pokemon, Kingdra's access to Ice Beam helps out in letting it hit threats like Tapu Bulu and Cradily. Kingdra has pretty decent bulk and a neutrality to Electric- and Grass-type attacks, which helps given the fact that it needs to continuously switch in throughout a match. While Kingdra can outspeed the entire unboosted metagame in rain, its Speed is underwhelming outside of it. Additionally, without rain boosting its Water-type STAB moves, Kingdra's Special Attack is unimpressive. Therefore, it requires specific team support that limits Kingdra to rain teams.</p> ",

Mega Venusaur is notable for being able to switch into Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, thanks to Thick Fat, and beat Kingdra one-on-one. It can't switch into Draco Meteor or Hydro Pump in rain after Stealth Rock damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types: Most defensive Water-types, such as Toxapex and Mantine, resist Hydro Pump and can comfortably switch into Draco Meteor. Certain Water-types that are immune to or resist Dragon, like Tapu Fini and Empoleon, are great switch-ins as well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Since Kingdra needs to come into play often, letting it accumulate too much chip damage can lead to it being picked off through priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Trace</strong>: Trace users like Mega Alakazam and Gardevoir can copy Swift Swim, outspeed Kingdra, and KO it easily.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis halves Kingdra's Speed, which means it can no longer sweep.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Raichu</strong>: Under Electric Terrain, Alolan Raichu can easily outspeed Kingdra and KO it with a boosted Thunderbolt.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is an insanely strong STAB move under rain that lets Kingdra 2HKO most Pokemon, including those that resist it, such as Rotom-W, Latios, and Slowbro. Draco Meteor lets Kingdra muscle past Pokemon that don't take much from Hydro Pump, such as Mega Venusaur and Lanturn. Ice Beam gives Kingdra a reliable tool against Dragon teams, notably hitting Mega Altaria, while also letting it hit certain Grass-type threats, like Tapu Bulu and Cradily, hard. While Hydro Pump is used to wallbreak, Surf lets Kingdra clean up weakened teams reliably thanks to its higher accuracy and PP. Alternatively, Scald can be used to try to cripple common switch-ins, like Ferrothorn, at the cost of a little power.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment is made in Speed, which, alongside Swift Swim, lets Kingdra outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under rain. 252 EVs are put into Special Attack with a Modest nature to let Kingdra hit as hard as possible. Choice Specs patches up Kingdra's average Special Attack and lets it wallbreak more easily under rain. 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to prevent Download users, like Porygon2 and Porygon-Z, from getting a Special Attack boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kingdra should primarily be used in rain. Bring it in as often as possible early-game to wallbreak with a strong rain- and Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump. Under rain, Hydro Pump is strong enough to 2HKO even targets that resist it and normally don't take much damage, like Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock damage. Therefore, try to keep the rain turns in mind to make the most use out of them. Kingdra can often be used to take out its own checks early-game and clean up with Surf or Scald later on. That being said, don't let it take too much chip damage from status or entry hazards, since it needs to switch in regularly. Therefore, try to bring it into play through Pelipper's slow U-turn or Politoed's Eject Button. Definitely keep Kingdra away from paralysis, as it prevents it from doing either of its jobs: sweeping and wallbreaking. While a paralyzed Kingdra can outspeed certain slower walls in the rain, it can't wallbreak efficiently between Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy and the chance to be fully paralyzed. For the most part, Kingdra shouldn't be used outside of rain, since its Special Attack and Speed are nothing to write home about. However, Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor is still pretty strong and can still be used to wallbreak without rain. Should Draco Meteor be used in rain, be wary that using it forces Kingdra to switch out and waste rain turns due to the Special Attack drop.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Kingdra absolutely requires rain support, rain setters like Pelipper and Politoed are great partners. Pelipper is notable for being able to check Grass-types like Mega Venusaur. Both of these Pokemon can also bring Kingdra into play safely through U-turn and Eject Button, respectively. Wallbreakers like Tail Glow Manaphy, Azumarill, Supersonic Skystrike Gyarados, and Keldeo can take care of checks to Kingdra, like Chansey, letting Kingdra clean up easily. Greninja's access to Protean and a fantastic movepool lets it customize its moveset to beat checks to Kingdra. For example, Greninja can take care of Mega Venusaur with Extrasensory and Mantine with Hidden Power Electric. Cleaners like Mega Sharpedo, Mega Swampert, and Kabutops appreciate Kingdra's wallbreaking abilities. Swampert and Seismitoad provide Electric immunities and can also set Stealth Rock, which makes wallbreaking easier. Toxapex can wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes while also acting as a reliable pivot into priority moves for Kingdra. Lanturn's ability Volt Absorb lets it act as a fantastic check to Alolan Raichu. Lanturn can also cure any status condition with Heal Bell and bring Kingdra in safely through Volt Switch.</p> "

Even without investment, Eviolite also lets Porygon2 take special attacks from wallbreakers like Latios and Hydreigon. Porygon2 complements Chansey really well, as they can switch into most of each other's checks and form a great defensive backbone for Normal teams that is capable of switching into almost every attack. A great ability in Trace lets Porygon2 check big threats to Normal teams like Dragonite and Landorus-T. Porygon2 has a diverse movepool with coverage options such as Ice Beam and Discharge, utility moves like Toxic and Foul Play, and reliable recovery in Recover. However, Porygon2's pure Normal typing doesn't offer any novel resistances and just adds on to the team's weakness to Fighting-types. Porygon2 is also extremely vulnerable to stallbreakers like Mew and is severely crippled by Knock Off and Trick users.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover gives Porygon2 a reliable way to recover health and allows it to continue to switch into attacks. Ice Beam gives Porygon2 good coverage, notably hitting Gliscor, which can otherwise stallbreak it, and Dragonite. Foul Play prevents Pokemon like Scizor from using Porygon2 as setup bait. It also hits other powerful physical attackers such as Excadrill. Toxic gives Porygon2 a way to wear down defensive Pokemon like Swampert and Mega Slowbro. Discharge can be used over Toxic for its good coverage alongside Ice Beam and its decent chance to paralyze the foe. Hidden Power Fire is a decent coverage option that, alongside Download, lets Porygon2 hit defensive Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn hard. Should Hidden Power Fire be used, Discharge must be run over Foul Play along with Download to let Porygon2 deal with Steel teams more easily. However, either of those options means losing out on Toxic's important utility.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investments are made in HP and Defense with a Bold nature to make Porygon2 as bulky as possible, letting it take hits from strong physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Excadrill. Eviolite boosts Porygon2's Defense and Special Defense to high levels. Trace is the preferred ability, as it allows Porygon2 to copy other abilities such as Multiscale from Dragonite, Intimidate from Gyarados, and Regenerator from Slowbro. Download should be used over Trace if Porygon2 is running three attacks to give it a chance to boost its Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Porygon2 as a pivot into physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Excadrill. Make sure to keep Porygon2 healthy with Recover whenever it switches into an attack to prevent it from being worn down easily. Use Trace to give Porygon2 more opportunities to switch in. Copying Multiscale lets Porygon2 at full health switch into Choice Band Dragonite, for example. Be careful of Knock Off and Trick users like Bisharp and Togekiss, as without Eviolite, Porygon2 can become a liability. Keep Porygon2 away from status ailments, particularly Toxic poison, as they limit its ability to switch into attacks. Try to hide what move Porygon2 is carrying in its fourth moveslot against some threats. For example, Mega Slowbro doesn't mind Discharge but hates Toxic. Conversely, Keldeo hates the Discharge paralysis. Porygon2 should use its bulk to stall out threats like Mega Slowbro with Toxic + Recover. Porygon2 can switch in as a sweeper such as Mega Charizard X attempts to set up, then punish it with Foul Play. If you're using three attacks on Porygon2, do note its usefulness against Steel teams. Try to send Porygon2 out when a physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory is on the field to give Porygon2 a boost in Special Attack. Make sure to take care of Bisharp and Toxic Heatran before attempting to clean up with Porygon2, however.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Porygon2 is a staple pick on balance teams thanks to its ability to check a plethora of threats and switch into physical attacks. Porygon2 and Chansey form a great defensive core. Porygon2 can switch into checks to Chansey like Dragonite and Excadrill, while Chansey can switch into special wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko. Only a handful of Pokemon can break through them. Chansey can additionally absorb status ailments thanks to Natural Cure, cure Porygon2 if it's already inflicted with status through Heal Bell, set Stealth Rock, and run Toxic to free Porygon2's last moveslot for another move. Mega Lopunny is a great switch-in to Knock Off and can easily check threats like Bisharp and Alolan Muk. Additionally, Mega Lopunny's Encore lets it take care of stallbreakers. On teams without Mega Lopunny, three attacks Porygon2 is very useful, as it can help against Steel teams. Staraptor can get rid of entry hazards with Defog and soften attacks from Fighting-types like Heracross with Intimidate. Staraptor is also a great switch-in to Knock Off and can check Bisharp, which is a huge threat, with Close Combat. Frailer Pokemon like Porygon-Z, Diggersby, Mega Pidgeot, and Meloetta appreciate having Porygon2 pivot into priority users like Scizor and Dragonite. Porygon2 can also wear down their checks with Toxic. Mega Pidgeot and Meloetta can additionally check Fighting-types. Ditto can punish setup sweepers that use Porygon2 as setup fodder like Manaphy and Xurkitree.</p> "

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Smeargle's massive support movepool lets it perform the role of lead entry hazard setter for offensive Normal-type teams. A unique combination of Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, and Spore allows it to support offensive teammates by chipping, slowing, and crippling foes early on in the battle. Sticky Web support from Smeargle is why hyper offensive Normal-type teams exist, and Smeargle is the only way to get it. Smeargle's ability to cripple leads with Spore or Nuzzle to set up hazards more easily also provides early momentum. However, its reliance on support moves and mediocre Speed stat make it susceptible to faster Taunt users such as Cobalion and Deoxys-S. It also has trouble against Magic Bounce and faster Substitute users such as Mega Sableye and Suicune, which can easily shut it down and set up on it. Smeargle is restricted to hyper offensive teams, as balance and defensive teams aren't in need of Sticky Web support.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>As the only viable Normal-type suicide lead, Smeargle uses Stealth Rock to support its teammates by wearing down opposing teams. Sticky Web support from Smeargle lets teammates have an advantage against Speed-reliant offensive teams. This is especially helpful against Fighting-type teams with threats such as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Heracross. Spore combined with Focus Sash allows Smeargle to incapacitate opposing lead Pokemon for a few turns and set entry hazards without much fear. Nuzzle allows Smeargle to not be Taunt bait and spread paralysis, the latter of which is well appreciated by offensive teammates. After putting a Pokemon to sleep with Spore, Smeargle can also paralyze switch-ins using Nuzzle. Magic Coat is an option over Nuzzle that allows Smeargle to bounce back moves such as Taunt. However, it is heavily prediction reliant, and a poor prediction can result in Smeargle not being able to set up hazards. Taunt is also an option to stop slower Defog users such as Mantine from clearing the entry hazards, thereby keeping opposing teams pressured. It stops opposing hazard setters such as Ferrothorn as well.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Smeargle to outspeed and cripple slower Pokemon such as Swampert, Mantine, and Bisharp. Maximum HP investment improves its overall bulk, allowing it to take uninvested attacks such as Scald from Empoleon and Swampert. Since Smeargle has bad defenses, Focus Sash is used to ensure that Smeargle can almost always get some form of entry hazard up. Own Tempo, albeit situational, helps against Hurricane users.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a dedicated lead, Smeargle should usually be sent out first to set entry hazards. However, when against teams with faster Taunt users such as Cobalion and Deoxys-S, Smeargle should not be used as a lead, because those Taunt users will shut it down completely. Most of the time, Smeargle should use Spore first to put foes to sleep so it can set up hazards liberally, but when against teams with Pokemon that can switch into Spore such as Grass-types, it is important to focus on setting up hazards. Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye need to be taken out before Smeargle can attempt to set up hazards. If you're facing them, force them out on the first turn by leading with a teammate like Diggersby and double switch to Smeargle for a single guaranteed hazard before they Mega Evolve. Spore can be saved for late-game to cripple a troublesome defensive wall like Celesteela or a setup sweeper such as Bisharp. Nuzzle should be used to spread paralysis after using Spore, as a sleeping Pokemon will usually be switched to one vulnerable to it. It also lets Smeargle cripple setup sweepers like Taunt Gyarados. Against faster Taunt leads, Smeargle should utilize Nuzzle to cripple them or Magic Coat to bounce back the Taunt. Against offensive types such as Ground, Fairy, and Fighting, Sticky Web should be prioritized, as it gives your team a Speed advantage. Against defensive teams such as Poison, Stealth Rock should be prioritized so KOs will be easier to secure.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Diggersby is a great teammate for Smeargle, as it can not only take advantage of Stealth Rock and Sticky Web but also pressure Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Mantine and Armaldo. Diggersby can also utilize a Swords Dance set to take advantage of the free turns that Spore provides. Mega Lopunny appreciates Sticky Web support letting it outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Victini, allowing it to pressure teams more effectively. It also eases Steel- and Rock-type matchups thanks to STAB High Jump Kick. Spore and Nuzzle support from Smeargle gives more setup opportunities to Porygon-Z, which is a fantastic special sweeper. Sticky Web allows it to outspeed even faster Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Greninja when at +1. Offensive Staraptor finds it easy to wallbreak thanks to Stealth Rock support and can deal with Fighting more easily with Sticky Web. Mega Pidgeot has fantastic Speed that is only augmented by Sticky Web support and can handle Fighting- and Steel-type teams due to its coverage of Hurricane and Heat Wave. Entry hazard support from Smeargle allows Meloetta to wallbreak more efficiently, as it need not worry about faster grounded threats such as Choice Specs Keldeo. Bewear's low Speed is mitigated by Sticky Web support, which enables it to wallbreak teams better. Its ability Fluffy allows it to be an offensive check to priority users such as Mega Scizor and Azumarill, which are troublesome for offensive teams.</p> "

Scald pressures physically offensive threats with burns, making it a great move to use with Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts. With the combination of Calm Mind, Pressure, and excellent bulk, Suicune can beat some of the biggest threats to Water teams, like Ferrothorn, one-on-one. At the same time, Suicune is very reliant on Scald to damage the foe, making any bulky Pokemon that resists it very hard for Suicune to break past. Without access to reliable recovery, Suicune is very quickly worn down by entry hazards and cannot reliably switch into attacks. Suicune is heavily reliant upon thorough team support and has to be used on specific builds to make it a threatening sweeper.</p> ",

Toxic can be used over Calm Mind, which allows Suicune to break past Pokemon such as Mantine and Cradily; however, then it loses any offensive presence.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types resist Suicune's Scald, making bulky ones very hard for Suicune to break past.

Tapu Koko deserves a special mention, as it sets up Electric Terrain to boost its Electric-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Taunt locks Suicune into Scald, which only is effectively spammed when Suicune is fully set up; Pokemon such as Cobalion can leave it easier for teammates such as Keldeo to deal with. Suicune is also vulnerable to Encore, as it mainly uses its passive and setup moves until it's ready to spam Scald. Mega Lopunny can lock Suicune into using a setup move such as Calm Mind and exploit that by spamming Power-Up Punch and proceeding to easily OHKO Suicune and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Suicune's way of cleaning through teams is Scald; however, bulky Water-types such as Toxapex can easily take a boosted Scald and recover off damage done by Suicune or remove its boosts with Haze. Empoleon can also tank a boosted Scald and force Suicune off the field with Roar, making it lose all of its stat boosts and possibly take more chip damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards When many entry hazards have been set, such as a few layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock, Suicune has a hard time being brought into play due to its only form of recovery being Leftovers. Suicune does not appreciate Toxic Spikes either, as the constant chip cancels out its Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Suicune relies on Leftovers to gain back health, as it has no access to recovery moves, making it a lot easier to chip down. Trick takes away Suicune's Leftovers and usually replaces it with a Choice item, making Suicune near useless.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Suicune relies on Scald to do damage, making any Water-immune Pokemon impossible to break past. Pokemon such as Cradily and Mantine can also badly poison Suicune, severely reducing its time on the field. However, Suicune can take on Water-immune Pokemon one-on-one due to Pressure, Calm Mind, and Protect, making them not the most reliable Suicune checks.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald allows Suicune to deal damage to opposing Pokemon and potentially cripple them with burns, making it harder for physical attackers to break through Suicune. Substitute helps Suicune avoid status conditions and becomes harder for special attackers to break with the help of Calm Mind. Substitute also acts as a buffer to get the most possible turns of Leftovers recovery and helps PP stall more effectively with Pressure. Calm Mind boosts Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing Suicune to not only hit harder but also tank special hits with more ease. Protect can be used to help stall out the opposing Pokemon's PP, scout moves, and allow Suicune to regain some health through Leftovers, which also helps keep Substitute up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed investment allows Suicune to outpace Pokemon such as Diggersby, Zapdos, Heatran, and Buzzwole. Suicune's HP investment enhances its natural bulk and allows it to form Substitutes with 101 HP, which don't break to one Seismic Toss. The Special Defense investment gives +1 Suicune's Substitute a good chance of withstanding Volt Switch from common users such as Rotom-W and Lanturn. Leftovers allows Suicune to regain health lost from Substitute and opposing Pokemon's attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to avoid switching in Suicune on hazards, as they wear it down very easily due to its lack of reliable recovery. Suicune is best used as a late-game setup sweeper after all of its checks and counters have been taken care of, as they can easily stall out Suicune's Scald. When facing slower Pokemon that can spread status such as Toxic Jirachi and Heatran, it is best to get up a Substitute to avoid those status conditions. Try to avoid losing Suicune's Leftovers to Trick or Knock Off, as it depends on Leftovers to stay healthy through the battle. In general, if a strong attacker comes in that is guaranteed to break Suicune's Substitute, Suicune needs to use Protect and then decide if it's worth trying to stall out the opposing Pokemon's move with Substitute + Protect. If not, use Scald on the turn Substitute breaks, and then either use Protect or switch out if the extra Pressure turn doesn't matter or Suicune doesn't need additional Leftovers recovery. Suicune should use Protect as much as possible to regain health from Leftovers to help its longevity. Protect should not be used recklessly, because using up its PP makes Suicune less effective at pressuring opposing Pokemon. Calm Mind is most easily and best set up behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex provides Suicune with Toxic Spikes, making Suicune's job of sweeping late-game easier. Toxapex also can check set up sweepers such as Volcarona with Haze. Keldeo is a tremendous help to Suicune, as it can help break through some of the toughest Suicune checks such as Ferrothorn as well as Water-immune Pokemon such as Cradily, Seismitoad, and Mantine by using Secret Sword and Hidden Power Electric. Greninja is a great Choice Scarf user that can take care of some key Fairy- and Grass-type threats such as Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko with Gunk Shot, and with a Life Orb, it can 2HKO Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire without locking itself into a weak attack. Mantine offers hazard control for Suicune, which is important because Suicune's lack of reliable recovery means it can easily be worn down by residual damage. Mantine also acts as a buffer to Grass-types, a means to prevent setup through Haze, and a way to break down opposing walls with Toxic. Mega Swampert and Gastrodon provide a key Electric-type immunity for Suicune and can remove Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko. Mega Swampert can also set up Stealth Rock, which wears down Suicune's checks each time they switch in. Mega Swampert and Gastrodon also provide a means of switching into Trick users, as Gastrodon's Sticky Hold keeps it from losing its item and Mega Stones can't be removed. Dragon Dance Gyarados provides a way to break past annoying Grass- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur with Supersonic Skystrike and Toxapex with +1 Earthquake. Azumarill provides a nice Grass immunity for Suicune. Empoleon can set up Stealth Rock for Suicune while also clearing hazards with Defog and phazing setup sweepers with Roar. Mega Sharpedo can take care of many bulky Pokemon that can give Suicune trouble such as Mantine and Slowbro with Crunch and weakened Mega Venusaur and Toxapex with Psychic Fangs, and its access to Speed Boost before Mega Evolving can help it outspeed and OHKO fast threats such as Choice Scarf Victini. Tentacruel is an option over Toxapex for providing the team with Toxic Spikes; unlike Toxapex, Tentacruel can clear hazards off the field with Rapid Spin, but it lacks the recovery that Toxapex gets. Lanturn provides a nice Electric-type immunity for Suicune and can clear away status with Heal Bell.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<h1>Rock</h1> <p>Tyranitar is one of the most essential Pokemon on Rock teams due to its vast array of utility options. Its excellent bulk allows it to survive most neutral hits, which can at times allow it to check Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Xurkitree. Its ability Sand Stream can grant all Rock-types increased Special Defense for five turns, aiding not only Tyranitar but also its teammates. Its varied physical movepool including Fire Punch and Earthquake does well at complementing its amazing Attack stat, making it a much more formidable wallbreaker. Tyranitar can additionally perform the role of a bulky pivot with an Assault Vest. Moreover, its decent Special Attack and strong special moves like Fire Blast and Ice Beam allow it to beat threats like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Access to Pursuit allows it to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Gengar, and with a Choice Band, it can trap and remove frail Pokemon like Greninja and Nihilego. However, Tyranitar's poor Speed stat usually means that it'll be forced to take damage first against most offensive threats. Its typing grants it an excessive number of weaknesses to common attacking types like Ground and Fairy, as well as a 4x weakness to Fighting. Additionally, it doesn't cover for any of Rock's natural weaknesses. Sand Stream can allow threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill to gain significantly more momentum.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p>Tyranitar is the premier Stealth Rock setter for Dark-type teams due to its great natural bulk and proficiency as a lead with tons of useful utility and coverage moves such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Fire Blast, and its Mega Evolution is a potent setup sweeper with access to great coverage options, allowing it to take on threatening types such as Steel and Ground. Due to Tyranitar's phenomenal natural bulk along with the sandstorm it summons with Sand Stream boosting its Special Defense, it can act as a defensive pivot and blanket check to many special attackers such as Latios and Nihilego. Tyranitar's part Rock typing also gives it a resistance to Fire-type attacks, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Victini. Mega Tyranitar's natural bulk also allows it to more readily set up with Dragon Dance against weaker Pokemon such as Klefki and Alolan Muk. Tyranitar's decent offensive stats even when left uninvested prevent it from being passive when using defensive sets, allowing it to still threaten hazard removers such as Zapdos, Mantine, and Armaldo. Tyranitar's wide movepool allows it to function as either a Stealth Rock setter or a Dragon Dance sweeper with access to fantastic coverage moves such as Ice Punch for Ground-types and Fire Punch for Steel-types. However, Mega Tyranitar's mediocre Speed stat leaves it susceptible to common revenge killers like Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Excadrill, even at +1. Due to Tyranitar's rather poor defensive typing, it is left weak to many common offensive types and stacks the Fighting weakness, giving Mega Tyranitar trouble setting up against a wide variety of Pokemon such as Terrakion and Tapu Bulu. Since Tyranitar does not have a solid form of recovery, chip damage from entry hazards and status conditions such as being poisoned and burned affect Tyranitar's longevity. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar also does not appreciate status conditions, as they all negatively affect its ability to sweep late-game</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Rock</h1> <p>Superpower can be used on Choice Band sets in order to hit Chansey and Porygon2. However, it does reduce Tyranitar's Attack and Defense, making it less effective as a wallbreaker, and Earthquake is better coverage for consistently 2HKOing Toxapex. Life Orb can be used to allow Tyranitar to switch up between moves. However, this will result in Tyranitar being worn down far more quickly, and without a Choice Band, it won't have a chance of OHKOing Excadrill with a boosted Pursuit. Dragon Dance is an option to turn Tyranitar into a powerful late-game sweeper, especially with support from Shuckle's Sticky Web. However, the immediate power offered by Choice Band is generally preferred as a means of 2HKOing Toxapex as it switches in.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p>Rockium Z in combination with Dragon Dance can be utilized on hyper offensive Dark-type teams, allowing Tyranitar to become a potent sweeper that can OHKO Pokemon such as Gliscor with +1 Continental Crush. This set is typically run so Mega Sharpedo can be used as the team's Mega Evolution and Krookodile can be used as the Stealth Rock setter. However, Tyranitar's rather poor Speed stat leaves it outsped by a ton of common Pokemon at +1 such as Tapu Koko and Greninja. Choice Band allows Tyranitar to become a powerful wallbreaker, making it very hard to switch into and allowing it to 2HKO defensive Skarmory and Celesteela, which Flying-type teams typically use as checks to Tyranitar. Other defensive utility moves can be used on specially defensive Stealth Rock setter Tyranitar such as Toxic over Thunder Wave, putting threats such as Azumarill on a timer. Protect and Toxic can be used over Thunder Wave and Fire Blast to scout which move Choice-locked Pokemon such as Greninja and Heracross use. However, this means that Tyranitar loses out on the speed control that Thunder Wave provides and on the ability to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn for good damage.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Rock</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Mega Gallade and Terrakion can very easily outspeed Tyranitar and OHKO it with their Fighting-type STAB moves. However, Mega Gallade can be outsped after Sticky Web if Tyranitar is running a Jolly nature.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Keldeo and Mega Swampert are able to OHKO Tyranitar with their STAB moves. Keldeo in particular resists both parts of Tyranitar's STAB combination, allowing it to actively switch into and threaten it at times.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Bisharp and Mega Scizor are capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Tyranitar. While Tyranitar resists Bisharp's priority in Sucker Punch, it's vulnerable to Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch even with Sticky Web support.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Mega Garchomp and Excadrill are able to outspeed Tyranitar and OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB moves. Excadrill in particular can exploit Tyranitar's Sand Stream to double its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Hippowdon and Porygon2 avoid a 2HKO from any of Tyranitar's attacks and can slowly wear it down, while being able to sustain themselves with their respective recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Status: Tyranitar is hindered by all forms of status. Burn halves its Attack, leaving it ineffective as a wallbreaker, paralysis makes it unable to outspeed hazard removers like Mantine, Armaldo, and Mandibuzz, and poison quickly wears it down.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Tyranitar struggles against Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Breloom, which resist both its STAB attacks and deal 4x super effective damage to it in return.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon resist Tyranitar's main STAB move in Stone Edge and can easily threaten it in return with their super effective Ground-type STAB moves. Hippowdon deserves a special mention, as it can very easily wall all variants of Tyranitar and phaze it with Whirlwind or inflict it with Toxic poison, severely limiting its time in battle.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon can easily take on a boosted Mega Tyranitar and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Toxapex should watch out for Earthquake, as it can not switch into it and is 2HKOed by it when Mega Tyranitar has not set up.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions: Both Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar do not appreciate status conditions, especially Mega Tyranitar, as they all affect its ability to sweep. Toxic poison, in particular, puts both of them on a very limited timer.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Many offensive Water-type Pokemon such as Manaphy threaten Tyranitar with their STAB attacks. Defensive Water-types such as Gastrodon and Toxapex can also burn Tyranitar with Scald, leaving it unable to sweep, with the latter additionally being able to Haze away its boosts.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to Mega Tyranitar's mediocre base Speed, it can be easily revenge killed even after a Dragon Dance boost by common Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Bulu and naturally fast Pokemon like Mega Lopunny.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Tyranitar's strongest move, giving it the most damage output against defensive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Mega Venusaur. Crunch is its most spammable move, allowing it to break through bulkier Psychic-types like Mega Slowbro and Mega Latias. Fire Punch is solid coverage for hitting Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela as well as preventing Mega Scizor from setting up safely. Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Gengar as well as frail Pokemon like Greninja and Nihilego. Earthquake is another option over Pursuit for consistently 2HKOing Toxapex.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is used to make Tyranitar as fast and strong as possible. An Adamant nature goes further lengths to increase Tyranitar's wallbreaking potential, allowing Crunch to guarantee a 2HKO against Mega Slowbro. A Jolly nature can also be used in order to outspeed Mega Gallade and Garchomp after Sticky Web. A Choice Band bolsters the power of Tyranitar's moves at the cost of being locked into a single one. Sand Stream summons sand upon switching in, which increases Tyranitar's Special Defense. This lets it survive a Moonblast from Mega Diancie and Hydro Pump from Greninja.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure to send in Tyranitar frequently to wallbreak, especially against more balanced types like Poison and Water. In spite of Tyranitar's great defenses, its lack of longevity makes it unable to actively take multiple hits. Try taking advantage of how Tyranitar can switch into walls like Mega Latias and Zapdos to bring it in safely to wallbreak. It's also a good idea to send it in when expecting the opponent to switch into a slower entry hazard remover like Armaldo or Torkoal in order to keep entry hazards up. If Pursuit is being used, try predicting when a weakened threat like Toxapex or Slowbro or a Choiced Pokemon locked into a weak move attempts to switch out so that Tyranitar can either remove it or severely chip it down. It can also be used to trap physically frail Pokemon like Excadrill and Diggersby. However, be careful when you use Pursuit, since, for example, trapping Latios can grant Mega Altaria a free setup opportunity. Despite being able to change the weather with Sand Stream, it's best not to bring Tyranitar in directly against weather setters like Torkoal and Pelipper, since they can threaten to burn it with Lava Plume and Scald, respectively. Against Ground, try sacrificing Tyranitar on the last turn of sand to allow a teammate like Alolan Golem to revenge kill Excadrill if Sticky Web is up. Avoid status as much as possible, especially burn, since it will diminish Tyranitar's effectiveness as a physical wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle can set up Sticky Web, allowing Tyranitar to outspeed Psychic-types such as Mew and Mega Gallade. It can also use Encore to lock foes into a weak move so that Tyranitar can safely Pursuit trap them. Mega Diancie can bounce back status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp with Magic Bounce while also being able to beat Fighting-types like Keldeo and Breloom. It also complements Tyranitar's slow wallbreaking with its fast revenge killing and sweeping to form an effective offensive core. Terrakion can check Steel-types like Excadrill and Bisharp and Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Tapu Bulu. In return, Tyranitar can switch into Psychic-type attacks for Terrakion, and use Pursuit to trap Latios and Mega Latias. It can also break past walls like Mandibuzz and Mega Sableye so that Terrakion can have an easier opportunity to sweep. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem are both capable of beating Mega Scizor for Tyranitar. Rhyperior can serve as a blanket check to powerful physical attackers like Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Terrakion, while Alolan Golem can trap and remove Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela. Nihilego checks Water-types like Swampert and Suicune with Grass Knot as well as Ground-types like Landorus and Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice. In return, Tyranitar can beat threatening Psychic-types like Latios and Mew if Sticky Web is up. Cradily switches into Water-type attacks for Tyranitar while also being able to switch into Ground-types like Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. It also appreciates Tyranitar's sand in order to avoid a 2HKO from Greninja's Ice Beam. Omastar, after setting up a Shell Smash, can beat Ground-types like Mamoswine, Hippowdon, and Landorus. It also appreciates Tyranitar's ability to break past special walls.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Tyranitar's strongest attack, allowing it deal large amounts of damage to most Pokemon. Crunch is its most spammable move, being able to do consistent damage to Psychic-types like Mew and Mega Latias. Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Gengar, as well as frail Pokemon like Greninja and Alolan Raichu. Fire Blast's coverage allows Tyranitar to nail Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn, as well as prevent Mega Scizor from setting up Swords Dance against it. Ice Beam is another option to KO Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in Special Defense with a Sassy nature maximizes Tyranitar's special bulk while simultaneously preserving the power of its special moves. Sand Stream is Tyranitar's best ability, since sand bolsters Tyranitar's Special Defense even further, allowing it to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Kingdra and Pelipper. Assault Vest is used to further increase Tyranitar's Special Defense, making it more effective as a bulky pivot.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Tyranitar to frequently pivot into special attacks from Pokemon like Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Latios. However, if there's a threat that you need Tyranitar as healthy as possible for, like Gliscor or Choice Scarf Landorus-T, it's usually best to preserve it. Despite being mainly used as a special attacking sponge, it can still come in on weaker physical attacks from certain entry hazard removers like Armaldo and Crobat. Try bluffing Choice Band against Pokemon like Heatran and Mantine so that you can hit a potential switch-in like Skarmory or Gliscor on the switch with the proper coverage move. This is also helpful against Focus Sash Alakazam, since you can break its Focus Sash with a special move to avoid a Counter. It's a good idea to use Pursuit to wear down Pokemon that Tyranitar can naturally force out, such as Greninja and Mega Charizard Y. Avoid status as much as possible, since burn will leave Tyranitar incapable of doing significant damage with its physical moves, and poison will quickly wear it down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion can beat Normal-types like Chansey and Porygon2 that can take hits from Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar can switch into and beat Psychic-types like Latios. Mega Diancie can bounce back entry hazards that wear down Tyranitar rather quickly while also checking Fighting-types like Mega Gallade and Buzzwole. Shuckle can set up Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team for Tyranitar and can also use Knock Off to remove items such as Chansey's Eviolite so that Tyranitar can do more against it. Nihilego can check Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon and Garchomp with Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice, respectively, as well as Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Breloom with a STAB Sludge Wave. In return, Tyranitar can switch into Psychic-type attacks for Nihilego and give it a helpful Special Defense increase with sand, allowing it to take Toxapex and Suicune's Scalds better. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem are both able to check Mega Scizor for Tyranitar. Rhyperior can blanket check Fighting-types like Terrakion and Heracross and Ground-types like Excadrill and Dugtrio. Alolan Golem is able to trap and remove Steel-types like Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Cradily can switch into Water-type attacks for Tyranitar and beat bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon that would otherwise beat Tyranitar. Shell Smash Omastar is able to beat Pokemon that threaten to OHKO Tyranitar such as Buzzwole and Mamoswine. It also appreciates Tyranitar's sand to give it better Special Defense for setting up with Shell Smash.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock chips foes when they switch in and can break abilities and items such as Dragonite's Multiscale and Breloom's Focus Sash. Stone Edge is Tyranitar's main STAB move and form of damage output and allows Tyranitar to hit Pokemon such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Kyurem-B. Rock Slide is a more reliable Rock-type STAB move that can be run over Stone Edge. Thunder Wave gives Tyranitar a form of speed control, allowing it to cripple offensive foes such as offensive Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Fire Blast allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-types such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor that would otherwise wall Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and Sassy nature maximize Tyranitar's special bulk, letting it more easily take on special threats such as Hydreigon and Volcarona. The Sassy nature also does not sacrifice the power of Tyranitar's Fire Blast. Sand Stream sets up sand, which gives Tyranitar an increase in Special Defense. Leftovers gives Tyranitar passive recovery, allowing it to continually switch into battle, tank attacks, and set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar should try to keep up Stealth Rock throughout the game. When a Flying-type Defogger comes in to clear entry hazards, Tyranitar should be switched in to force a switch with its STAB Stone Edge and take advantage of it to set up Stealth Rock again. Thunder Wave should be used against faster threats that Tyranitar cannot OHKO with Stone Edge, such as Latios, allowing teammates such as Mandibuzz and Greninja to more easily check it. Tyranitar is a great special sponge and should switch in on attacks it is not weak to, such as Kyurem-B's Ice Beam and Mega Pidgeot's Hurricane. Preserve Tyranitar against types like Flying and Normal, where it comes in handy against threats like Mega Charizard Y and Porygon-Z. Sand Stream can be used to chip Focus Sash and Multiscale users such as Breloom and Dragonite, allowing teammates to more easily revenge kill these Pokemon. Tyranitar should avoid status conditions, as they affect its longevity in battle due to lack of reliable recovery. For the same reason, it should also avoid switching into entry hazards and weak attacks that its teammates like Mandibuzz can take care of.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mandibuzz forms an entry hazard control core with Tyranitar and also possesses a Fighting-type neutrality, allowing it to switch into powerful STAB attacks such as Infernape's Close Combat. Mandibuzz also forms a nice defensive core with Tyranitar, as it is a fantastic physical wall. Mega Sableye possesses a Fighting-type immunity to support Tyranitar, can defend against Trick and Knock Off users that target Tyranitar, and can reflect hazards and status conditions with Magic Bounce such as Toxic Spikes from Toxapex and Toxic from Porygon2. Mega Sableye can also threaten physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, leaving them unable to wallbreak successfully. Mega Sharpedo appreciates Tyranitar's ability to set up Stealth Rock, as it can clean more easily with the chip damage Stealth Rock provides. Mega Sharpedo can also take care of Fighting-types that Tyranitar struggles against such as Keldeo with Psychic Fangs at +1 Speed. Alolan Muk is a nice switch-in to Fairy-type attacks and can remove items such as Hydreigon's Choice Specs with Knock Off, giving Tyranitar an easier time setting up Stealth Rock. Greninja is a great Choice Scarf user, able to pivot Tyranitar in with U-turn, outspeed and OHKO Dragonite after Multiscale is broken, and revenge kill Tapu Bulu, and it also appreciates Tyranitar's ability to switch into strong special attackers such as Volcarona lacking Bug Buzz. Greninja can also form a hazard stacking core with Tyranitar, as it has access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Bisharp can break past Fairy-type Pokemon such as Klefki and Clefable for Tyranitar and threaten Defoggers such as Zapdos due to Defiant. Hydreigon is a fantastic special wallbreaker that can take care of Pokemon such as Skarmory for Tyranitar and can switch directly into Water- and Grass-type attacks as well as Ground-type attacks due to Levitate.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance (Dark)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Tyranitar's Attack and Speed by one stage each, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Tapu Koko after one boost. Stone Edge is Mega Tyranitar's strongest STAB attack. Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that would otherwise wall it. Earthquake provides good coverage with Stone Edge and allows Mega Tyranitar to hit Electric-, Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokemon such as Alolan Golem, Toxapex, and Excadrill. Ice Punch allows Tyranitar to hit Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T, preventing them from walling it. Crunch is Tyranitar's main Dark-type STAB attack and allows it to threaten Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mew and Hoopa, though opting for Crunch means that Tyranitar loses out on being able to threaten Ground-types such as Garchomp with Ice Punch. Stealth Rock is an option over Fire Punch for teams that need role compression, but this means Tyranitar will be walled by Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that would otherwise be no problem for it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment allows Mega Tyranitar to be as fast and strong as possible. A Jolly nature allows Mega Tyranitar to outspeed key threats such as Tapu Koko and Greninja at +1 Speed and Pokemon such as Jolly Bisharp before a Dragon Dance. Tyranitarite allows Tyranitar to Mega Evolve, making it a more formidable sweeper with a decent increase in Speed, Attack, and overall bulk. Sand Stream boosts Tyranitar's Special Defense by 50% and chips the foe at the end of each turn for five turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against passive Pokemon such as Klefki, which Tyranitar is not threatened by at all, Mega Tyranitar should and can easily use Dragon Dance to sweep through the team. Wait for Mega Tyranitar's checks, such as Choice Scarf Keldeo, to be removed before attempting to set up. Mega Tyranitar should switch out to a teammate such as Alolan Muk on all status-inducing moves, as all status conditions threaten it and hinder its ability to sweep. Since Mega Tyranitar is best used as a late-game cleaner, you should make sure it does not take too much damage to give it the best chance to sweep. Mega Tyranitar should be preserved to help check threats such as Kyurem-B and Volcarona before attempting to set up and sweep. If Stealth Rock is run, it should be used to capitalize on when Mega Tyranitar forces a switch, as this will give it a free turn to do so.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Greninja acts as a nice blanket check to offensive Pokemon that threaten Mega Tyranitar due to its great coverage in moves like Gunk Shot to hit Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Ice Beam to hit Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp. Greninja appreciates Mega Tyranitar's ability to take on special walls that wall it such as Chansey. Krookodile takes the role of Stealth Rock setter, allowing Tyranitar to run the Dragon Dance set. Krookodile can also remove items such as Greninja's Choice Scarf with Knock Off to ease Mega Tyranitar's attempts at sweeping and Taunt other slower leads such as Skarmory to prevent them from setting up Stealth Rock, allowing Mega Tyranitar to more easily set up. Mandibuzz is the best answer to Fighting-type teams when Mega Tyranitar is being used and can tank Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Heracross and Terrakion. Mandibuzz can also clear away entry hazards with Defog so that Mega Tyranitar can more easily switch in through the match, and Mega Tyranitar can beat Ice- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Weavile and Tapu Koko for Mandibuzz. Alolan Muk is a nice switch-in to Fairy-type attacks and can remove items such as Hydreigon's Choice Specs with Knock Off, giving Mega Tyranitar an easier time setting up Dragon Dance. Hydreigon is a fantastic special wallbreaker that is capable of taking on physical walls that Mega Tyranitar has difficulty breaking past such as Ferrothorn and Quagsire. Bisharp can set Stealth Rock for Mega Tyranitar, which allows it to freely run Fire Punch, and can also paralyze faster threats such as Terrakion with Thunder Wave. Bisharp can also act as an excellent Swords Dance sweeper alongside Mega Tyranitar, as they both share similar checks and appreciate the other being able to wear them down.</p> "

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<h1>Grass</h1> <p>With its access to Nasty Plot and its expansive movepool, Celebi is a viable special wallbreaker that is capable of dealing with common threats to Grass such as Poison- and Steel-type teams. Its Psychic typing helps Grass-type teams deal with Poison-type teams, as Celebi can check Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Nidoking, and Toxapex that are otherwise a pain for Grass-type teams to deal with. On the other hand, the combination of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire lets Celebi threaten common Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Natural Cure lets Celebi freely absorb status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave for its teammates. Celebi's good bulk and handy resistances allow it to tank hits from Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Excadrill. However, Celebi is weak to common coverage types such as Fire and Ice, and its weaknesses to Dark- and Bug-type moves can be taken advantage of by U-turn users such as Greninja and Tapu Koko and Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar. Furthermore, an average base 100 Special Attack prevents Celebi from breaking past common threats such as Alolan Muk and Jirachi without boosting its stats; however, it can break past them with a +2 Tectonic Rage. It also has an average Speed stat that allows it to outspeed some threats to Grass-type teams such as Nidoking but causes it to be outsped by a majority of the threats to Grass such as Blacephalon, Mega Pinsir, and Landorus.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Celebi's wide movepool and decent base 100 stats across the board make it a versatile option for Psychic teams that can act as a setup sweeper or bring a wide range of utility options to the team. By using Nasty Plot to boost its otherwise unimpressive Special Attack, Celebi is able to counter Steel teams with a combination of Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power, turning the tables on a normally difficult matchup. It also has access to a great supportive movepool with Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Healing Wish, giving it both many ways to help its team and unpredictability. Celebi has great mixed bulk, recovery, and a typing that grants valuable resistances to Ground, Electric, and Water and lets it wall almost the entire standard Fairy team, another strong type that Psychic can struggle with at times. Celebi is also a great Pokemon for taking on Water- and Ground-types as a result of its STAB Giga Drain. However, that typing can come back to hurt Celebi, as it is weak to a large number of types that are common coverage, including Fire and Ice, and especially weak to Bug-type moves like U-turn. While Nasty Plot helps alleviate Celebi's damage problems, it has awful damage output without a boost due to its below average Special Attack and its moves' poor Base Power, so it can still find itself walled even after boosting once or twice. Celebi faces a lot of competition in the utility department, as Pokemon such as Mew and Jirachi either bring even more utility options or have a better defensive typing. Nevertheless, Celebi creates its own niche by combining options no other Psychic-type can bring together, such as breaking both Water and Steel or carrying Healing Wish along with its own recovery.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p>Celebi can use Recover over Hidden Power Fire to increase its longevity, but this leaves it significantly more vulnerable to Mega Scizor and gives it a worse matchup against Steel-type teams.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>The Nasty Plot set can try to run Psychic to more effectively take on Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, but all of the usual coverage moves are often much more important. Heal Bell is a utility move that defensive Celebi can choose to run, but Psychic teams don't tend to need it, and its other utility moves are often more generally useful. Due to Celebi's Natural Cure, Heal Bell also has less use than usual, as Celebi can simply switch out to remove any status effects. Toxic is another supportive option that lets defensive Celebi cripple walls such as Mantine, but Psychic teams have many other options for beating walls.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types, such as Hydreigon and Mega Sableye, are immune to Psychic and threaten Celebi out with their STAB attacks. Hydreigon is especially notable because it is also immune to Ground.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types and Bug-type Move Users: Bug-types such as Heracross, Yanmega, Scolipede, and Mega Scizor all threaten Celebi out, although Mega Scizor should watch out for Hidden Power Fire. Common U-turn users such as Landorus-T and Greninja also force Celebi out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Greninja and faster attackers like Nihilego and Blacephalon are capable of easily revenge killing Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Weavile threaten Celebi with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Chansey and Mantine take little from Celebi's attacks and can force it out with Toxic; Chansey is also capable of setting Stealth Rock freely against it.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: All Celebi sets are eventually forced out by tough walls like Chansey, as Celebi doesn't have much power even with Nasty Plot boosts.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Strong attackers with super effective coverage such as Greninja and Heracross are able to muscle through Celebi's bulk and take it out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although they are afraid of Tectonic Rage, Fire-types like Victini are generally capable of switching into and forcing out Celebi, as an unboosted Earth Power doesn't do much damage. Mega Charizard Y is especially notable for being able to wall and OHKO Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Celebi's main draw is its mixed bulk, so wallbreakers that specialize in physical damage, such as Choice Band Diggersby, or special damage, such as Choice Specs Latios, can be strong enough to muscle through Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: The defensive set is rather ineffective against stallbreakers like Gliscor, Mew, and Mega Sableye. Taunt users can also prevent the Nasty Plot set from setting up, keeping Celebi from boosting its average Special Attack.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Some setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade, Mega Latias, Mimikyu, and Porygon-Z can use Celebi's lack of offensive presence to set up on it.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Nasty Plot (Grass)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot allows Celebi to boost its Special Attack and break opposing teams. With a boost, Celebi can KO Pokemon that can otherwise stomach its attacks, such as Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. Psychic allows Celebi to threaten Poison-type teams, as it can take out Pokemon such as Nidoking, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur with it. Earth Power allows Celebi to threaten Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types such as Alolan Muk, Alolan Marowak, and Heatran, which are all otherwise troublesome for Grass-type teams. Groundium Z makes it possible to blow past common checks to Celebi and problematic Pokemon for Grass-type teams such as Jirachi and Alolan Muk. Hidden Power Fire lets Celebi check Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor that otherwise wall it. The combination of Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power provides Celebi with good coverage. Giga Drain is an option over Hidden Power Fire for a STAB move that also heals Celebi, which makes it harder to take out; however, it has poor offensive coverage, and Grass-type teams appreciate the coverage that Hidden Power Fire provides more.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Celebi to maximize its damage output. Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature lets Celebi outrun everything below base 100s, such as Nidoking. Groundium Z allows Celebi to use a 175-Base Power Tectonic Rage to get past common checks such as Jirachi and Alolan Muk. Life Orb can be used over Groundium Z to boost the power of Celebi's moves if the team already has a Z-Move user; however, Celebi is quickly worn down by Life Orb recoil and does not run any form of recovery on the set. Celebi also fails to OHKO Pokemon such as Alolan Muk and Jirachi with +2 Life Orb-boosted Earth Power. Natural Cure is Celebi's only available ability, and it lets Celebi act as a status absorber.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against Poison- and Steel-type teams, Celebi should find setup opportunities by forcing out passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Celebi should avoid staying in if the opponent has a U-turn user such as Greninja or Landorus-T, as it is extremely weak to Bug-type moves. Despite its decent bulk, Celebi should avoid taking unnecessary damage, especially if it needs to check threatening Pokemon for the team or clean late-game. Tectonic Rage should be saved for when Celebi needs to break past one of its checks such as Alolan Muk. Celebi should be used to absorb status conditions for its teammates, as it has Natural Cure to heal its status condition when it switches out. Celebi should be used to lure in Pokemon such as Alolan Muk, Heatran, and Mega Scizor by not revealing Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire until the right moment.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cradily is a very good teammate for Celebi because it can check Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Blacephalon that Celebi struggles with. Cradily is also able to set Stealth Rock to support Celebi further. Ferrothorn covers Celebi's weaknesses to Ice, Poison, and Bug while also providing Spikes support to wear down opposing teams. Mega Venusaur is a solid wall that Celebi can rely on, as Thick Fat and its Poison typing give it neutralities to Fire, Bug, and Ice. Thanks to its high bulk, it can check threats to Celebi such as Mega Scizor and Choice Scarf Heracross. Breloom can support Celebi by using Mach Punch to check threats like Greninja, Bisharp, and Hydreigon, breaking past special walls such as Chansey, and giving Celebi opportunities to set up thanks to Spore. Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu is a good teammate because it can revenge kill threats to Celebi such as Mega Charizard Y. Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain is also helpful for Celebi, as it boosts the power of Giga Drain and gives Celebi a form of passive recovery. In return, Celebi deals with Poison-types that Tapu Bulu cannot break past such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Choice Scarf Rotom-C can check Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard Y, which both greatly threaten Grass-type teams. Volt Switch allows Rotom-C to bring Celebi in safely, gaining momentum on a predicted switch. Rotom-C also helps a lot versus Flying-type teams thanks to its STAB Thunderbolt.</p> "

        "name": "Nasty Plot (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Celebi's otherwise mediocre Special Attack to make it strong enough to break many walls, including even Celesteela. Giga Drain is Celebi's primary STAB attack and pressures Water and Ground teams. With the help of Nasty Plot, it can also provide significant recovery to Celebi. Earth Power takes out Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran and Toxapex that try to wall Celebi and combines with Groundium Z to become a powerful Tectonic Rage that can even KO Alolan Muk with minor chip damage and only one Nasty Plot boost. Hidden Power Fire combines with Earth Power to let Celebi dismantle most Steel teams by taking on Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs let Celebi do as much damage as possible. With 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature, Celebi at least Speed ties with other base 100s and outspeeds Mimikyu, enabling Celebi to break its Disguise or deal significant damage to it. As its only ability, Natural Cure lets Celebi heal status if it needs to switch out and set up later. Groundium Z allows Celebi to use Tectonic Rage to break many Pokemon that otherwise stop Celebi from sweeping. If a teammate is using the Z-Move, Life Orb can be used instead, but the loss of Tectonic Rage's damage output is significant.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Celebi is not particularly strong even with a Nasty Plot under its belt, it should avoid setting up too early, preferring to wait until its checks have been worn down slightly to make sure it can sweep. For example, in the Steel matchup, it is necessary to pop Heatran's Air Balloon before Celebi attempts to sweep Steel teams, as Air Balloon Heatran can completely wall Celebi. Be careful with Celebi's only use of Tectonic Rage. For example, in the Poison matchup, while taking out Toxapex can be tempting, Earth Power can be difficult for it to handle, and saving Tectonic Rage for Alolan Muk is typically more important. Although Celebi has Natural Cure to remove status, it should still avoid being statused, as it can find it difficult to sweep when paralyzed or taking not insignificant amounts of damage every turn. Similarly, it should avoid taking too much damage before it sets up. While Giga Drain can provide Celebi with recovery after a Nasty Plot or two, Celebi should not rely on it and should try to only set up against Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that cannot threaten it much. Celebi should also take care to avoid revealing that it is using an offensive set before it's ready to set up, as the surprise can net it a free Nasty Plot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock puts a lot of defensive Pokemon into range of being KOed by Celebi, so Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Jirachi are great teammates depending on the team archetype. Deoxys-S can also provide dual screens support to make it even easier for Celebi to set up and sweep. U-turn users such as Victini and Jirachi can bring Celebi into play safely and give it more setup opportunities. Because Toxic Spikes can make it difficult or impossible for Celebi to sweep, Latias and Latios are both very useful for their Defog utility. They are also both resistant to Fire and can bring additional utility in Healing Wish and Memento for Celebi. As a stallbreaker, Mew can take on many of the walls that Celebi can struggle against, such as Chansey. Other wallbreakers and sweepers such as Mega Gallade, Mega Slowbro, Choice Band Victini, and Latios can find it easier to operate when Celebi has removed some of their checks.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is invaluable utility that punishes Pokemon for switching in and is essential for helping Psychic teams take on Bug-types. Recover gives Celebi longevity and the ability to act as a wall by restoring HP that it loses when pivoting into attacks. Giga Drain is a STAB attack that heals Celebi and makes it difficult for Ground teams to handle. For the last slot, Celebi has a wide range of support moves that it can viably use. U-turn lets Celebi pivot to other teammates after it has set up Stealth Rock or if threatened by a switch-in. Healing Wish is a powerful utility move that can give a teammate such as Mega Gallade a second chance by sacrificing Celebi. If the other utility moves aren't needed, Thunder Wave cripples the Speed of offensive Pokemon such as Hydreigon, making them much less threatening.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and Calm nature give Celebi great mixed bulk, enabling it to take two Draco Meteors from Life Orb Latios and two Iron Heads from Choice Band Excadrill, and the Speed investment lets Celebi outspeed Adamant Diggersby. Leftovers gives Celebi additional passive recovery. A Colbur Berry can also be used with Thunder Wave to cripple Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo. Natural Cure lets Celebi sponge status freely, both protecting its teammates and giving it an advantage against most walls.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Celebi's great mixed bulk and unique typing to switch it into Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko. However, it lacks the greater Defense and Special Defense needed to stand up against stronger wallbreakers, so make sure to avoid letting Celebi take super effective hits from wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Kingdra. Once in play, Celebi should aim to set Stealth Rock and keep it up. Against walls, thanks to Natural Cure, Celebi should happily take any status effect in order to set Stealth Rock. If it runs Thunder Wave, Celebi should also spread the status around by using the move liberally trying to catch switch-ins. Make sure to keep Celebi healthy with Recover so that it can continue to switch into attacks for the team. Celebi can act as an effective defensive pivot by coming into attacks and pivoting right out with U-turn after forcing out the foe, such as against Alolan Golem. When using Healing Wish, it is usually advised to try to make sure Stealth Rock cannot be removed easily, as Celebi will not be able to set it again. Healing Wish can also prevent a slower Defogger or spinner from being able to remove Stealth Rock as well if it becomes necessary.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Grass's many weaknesses, Celebi greatly appreciates having other defensive teammates like Slowbro and Mega Slowbro that can switch into the likes of Mamoswine, which force Celebi out. Jirachi, while often the user of Stealth Rock for Psychic teams, can be freed to use other utility such as Wish when paired with Celebi while also providing great defensive synergy for Celebi by resisting Ice and being neutral to Bug. All Latias and Latios are especially good partners with Celebi thanks to their typing and Celebi's ability to wall almost all Fairy-types. In addition to providing defensive utility, both can run Defog to keep entry hazards from weakening Celebi, and Mega Latios can take out Steel- and Poison-types for Celebi. Wallbreakers like Choice Band Victini or stallbreakers such as Mew take out walls that Celebi can't touch. Setup sweepers like Mega Latias, Mega Gallade, and Mewnium Z Mew are great teammates for Celebi with U-turn or Healing Wish, as Celebi can bring them in safely or give them another chance to sweep. Mega Gallade particularly appreciates Healing Wish, as it can freely take damage to break its checks and then heal back up to pull off the sweep. Alakazam can be used as a blanket check to physical attackers, helping Celebi with Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Heracross.</p> "

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Swampert has a phenomenal Water / Ground typing that leaves it with only one weakness and provides Water teams with a very important Electric immunity. Furthermore, Swampert has access to a wide array of useful utility moves to support the team such as Stealth Rock and Roar. Its amazing bulk allows it to take hits and safely set entry hazards or run defensive sets as Mega Swampert. Mega Swampert is a solid sweeper as well thanks to gaining Swift Swim as an ability, outspeeding many offensive threats in rain such as Landorus, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. However, Swampert is held back by an unfortunate lack of reliable recovery and therefore no longevity. Furthermore, it has a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves, which is very counterproductive for Water teams. Another setback for Swampert is that it has no offensive presence unless it's Mega Swampert, and despite an amazing base 150 Attack stat, Mega Swampert is often walled because it lacks a wide pool of reliable coverage moves. It is also completely crippled by burns, as it will no longer be the great wallbreaker it was. Lastly, despite Swampert’s solid bulk, its vulnerability to residual damage prevents it from switching in and out of the battle constantly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Swampert can run Mirror Coat with Rindo Berry, a set that has the niche of catching big threats by surprise. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard Y, and many other special attackers can be easily dealt with this way. However, it can be unreliable once your opponents gain knowledge of your use of this set. For example, Mega Venusaur can easily scout for this set by hitting Swampert with Leech Seed or Sludge Bomb. An alternative way of forcing threats to switch out instead of Roar is Yawn. However, it doesn't have the same guarantee of pushing out a threat that Roar provides. Also, Swampert can run Protect along with Leftovers in order to regain some health and to scout the opponent. Rest is another option that allows Swampert to restore its health, as well as cure status, allowing it to wall Pokemon such as Toxic Zapdos. Mega Swampert can also run a Jolly nature in order to outspeed threats like fast Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Nihilego in rain. Stone Edge is a coverage option on Mega Swampert that allows it to hit Mantine, which it would otherwise be walled by. Another attack option is Superpower, as it aids against threats such as Ferrothorn, Cradily, Porygon2, and Chansey. However, the Attack drop kills Mega Swampert's ability to sweep. Lastly, Mega Swampert has enough bulk to run Rain Dance to safely set up its own rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Bulkier Grass-types such as Cradily, Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can completely shut down Swampert and use it as a way to get back HP through Recover, Synthesis, Leech Seed, Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Swampert's quadruple weakness to Grass-type moves makes it very vulnerable to Grass-type coverage from the likes of Tapu Koko, Greninja and Alolan Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users: As Mega Swampert has such a low Speed stat, extremely fast Choice Scarf users like Latios and Nihilego can easily outspeed Adamant Mega Swampert in rain and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Pokemon like Porygon2 and Slowbro can safely take hits from Swampert and whittle it down with moves like Toxic and Scald.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types That Are Immune To Ground: Swampert is completely walled by Pokemon like Mantine and Rotom-W. Not only do they safely take hits from it, but they can also cripple it with burns. Mantine is an especially nasty threat because of its ability to absorb the Water-type attacks Swampert uses and Defog away Stealth Rock. However, these Pokemon should be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status: Being a physical sweeper, Mega Swampert becomes practically useless when burned because it cannot break foes effectively. Poison can also hinder Swampert's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Trace</strong>: Pokemon with Trace can copy Swift Swim and possibly sweep Swampert’s team if the right conditions are met.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers, such as Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Landorus, can completely obliterate Swampert while not being too threatened by its lacking offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Knock Off, from the likes of Bisharp and Mega Gallade, removes Leftovers Swampert's only way of recovering some HP, which reduces its presence in the battle.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock breaks opposing Focus Sash and gets useful residual damage against the opposing team that Swampert's teammates take out opposing threats like Zapdos more easily. Scald is used to get burns against threats that would normally switch in on Swampert, wearing them down. Roar prevents sweepers from easily setting up on Swampert because of its lack of offensive presence. Earthquake is used to hit the Electric-types that give Swampert's teammates a lot of trouble. Toxic can be used in order to put timers on opposing Pokemon, namely opposing walls such as Porygon2, as well as Pokemon that try to Defog away its Stealth Rock such as Zapdos and Mantine.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Defense and HP investment paired with a Relaxed nature gives Swampert enough bulk to take hits from imposing physical attackers. Torrent is the preferred ability, as it gives a weakened Swampert a strong Scald. Furthermore, Explosion and Self-Destruct are not relevant, so Damp wouldn't have any use. Leftovers is used to make up for Swampert’s lack of a reliable recovery move. However, Swampertite is another possible item because Mega Evolving gives Swampert better bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In general, Swampert should be the lead, as getting Stealth Rock up as soon as possible is very important. As it has a very important utility role on the team, Swampert receiving too much damage when its Electric immunity is essential should be avoided. It should also be preserved in matchups where Stealth Rock pressure and the ability to phaze sweepers are extremely important. Another way to ensure Swampert's longevity is to prevent it from being hit by Knock Off, which removes its only form of recovery. In addition, it should not take too much residual damage from entry hazards and must not be affected by status such as burn or poison. Therefore, Swampert shouldn't stay in on walls known for carrying status moves such as Porygon2. Despite this, Swampert can take the burn for a teammate if absolutely necessary, as it relies more on spreading burns with Scald than actually being a physically offensive threat. While Swampert is used for its Electric immunity, it needs to be wary of the many Electric-types that carry Grass-type coverage. It is essential to be careful around Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Xurkitree, and Alolan Raichu, which can proceed to trample the team if they catch Swampert with a Grass-type move. To prevent Swampert from being setup bait, use Roar to force out Pokemon that try taking advantage of its passive nature. Said move also prevents opponents from pulling double switches and in fact should be used to push out incoming threats while also slowly weakening them with residual damage. Swampert can safely pivot in on threatening physical attackers and cripple them with burns. In similar fashion, its Scald can also be used to burn bulkier threats. If Swampertite is being used instead of Leftovers, it is essential to Mega Evolve immediately to get the increase in bulk. However, defensive Mega Swampert needs to be played with very carefully because it has absolutely no form of recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gyarados is a great sweeper that can check the Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Swampert thanks to its Water / Flying typing and access to Supersonic Skystrike. Also, Swampert can safely switch into the Electric-type and Rock-type attacks directed at Gyarados. While not a sweeper like Gyarados, Mantine is a great partner for similar reasons. Together with Swampert, it forms a solid defensive core in which each Pokemon can safely take the attacks that would be super effective on the other. Mantine can also assist Swampert in shutting down setup sweepers by neutering special attackers like Volcarona with Haze. Toxapex can also easily switch in on Grass-type attacks, wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes, and use Haze to render setup sweepers useless. Tapu Fini prevents status and entry hazards from causing too much residual damage to Swampert thanks to Misty Terrain and Defog. In addition, it also handles the Dragon-type Pokemon that Swampert struggles against. Calm Mind Mega Slowbro takes the dangerous physical attacks that would hurt Swampert too much. Another amazing Calm Mind user is Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, which is an excellent partner because of its ability to completely break down teams and stall out Mega Venusaur. Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados take advantage of the residual damage caused by Swampert’s Stealth Rock and Scald burns to sweep opposing teams. Greninja can also sweep opposing teams with support from Swampert while also checking threats that completely wall it such as Grass-types, Dragon-types, and bulky Psychic-types with moves like Ice Beam, Gunk Shot, Hidden Power Fire, and Dark Pulse. Another special attacking option would be Keldeo, which can assist Swampert by taking on threats like the Eviolite core of Chansey + Porygon2.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock facilitates sweeping for Mega Swampert and it’s teammates by breaking Focus Sash and weakening the opposing team with residual damage. Overall, it helps Mega Swampert's teammates KO opposing threats like Zapdos much more easily. Waterfall is a powerful STAB move that is used to sweep opposing teams in the rain. Earthquake is the STAB attack that can be used to beat Pokemon that Waterfall can’t such as Toxapex, Volcanion and Jellicent. Ice Punch allows Mega Swampert to hit Dragon and Grass-type Pokemon that it would otherwise have trouble getting past such as Latios, Dragonite, and Breloom for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs paired with an Adamant nature allow Mega Swampert to sweep in rain. 4 Special Defense EVs prevent Pokemon with the Download ability from getting a Special Attack boost when they switch into Swampert. 252 Speed EVs and Swift Swim allow Mega Swampert to outspeed a big part of the metagame in rain, therefore placing a lot of pressure on the opposing team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swampert should be used as a lead to get up Stealth Rock early-game. This puts a lot of pressure on the opponent, limiting their switches. However, be wary of Grass-type coverage on Electric-type Pokemon. Swampert won't always be able to freely get up Stealth Rock against them. It is crucial to avoid being crippled by burns, which render Mega Swampert practically useless for the remainder of the battle. In fact, it is best to save Mega Swampert for a late-game sweep once its threats are either weakened or knocked out. Also, it should absolutely be used only in rain to sweep and break teams. Outside of rain, it would be too slow to perform as a sweeper and would lack slightly in power without the rain boost on Waterfall. Fast Choice Scarf users, such as Latios and Terrakion, should be removed before Mega Swampert attempts to sweep because they can possibly revenge kill Mega Swampert even with its Swift Swim boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pelipper is a crucial partner for Mega Swampert, as it can set rain, get rid of entry hazards, and allow Mega Swampert to take advantage of rain on several occasions thanks to its nice bulk and access to recovery. With access to U-turn, Pelipper can safely bring in Mega Swampert once the rain is up. To support Pelipper, Politoed with Eject Button can be used as a secondary rain setter. Its item will allow Swampert to safely enter the battle without suffering too much unnecessary damage. Kingdra is an amazing Pokemon to pair with Mega Swampert, as it helps it in sweeping and breaking the opposing team under rain. While Mega Swampert can take care of more specially defensive Pokemon, Kingdra can attack the physically defensive ones. Also, it handles the Dragon-types that Swampert can't touch without Ice Punch. Gyarados and Manaphy are great Z-Move users to pair up with Mega Swampert because they both can check Mega Venusaur. Gyarados in particular has great synergy because Mega Swampert can switch in on the super effective Electric-type and Rock-type attacks. Choice Band Azumarill helps break frustrating defensive cores like Porygon + Chansey and Cradily + Ferrothorn. It can also help against Dragon-types. Likewise, Keldeo is another Pokemon that can help break those defensive cores while simply being a reliable sweeper to assist the team. Greninja can set up Spikes to cause even more residual damage to the opposing team and also be an offensive threat with its wide variety of coverage moves. It can help against the Grass-types, Dragon-types, and Psychic-types that are quite troublesome for Mega Swampert. On the more defensive side, Toxapex is also an interesting partner that can wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes. This makes it easier for Mega Swampert to sweep as the game progresses. Also, it can safely switch in on attacks aimed at Swampert such as Grass-type ones.</p> "

Furthermore, Swellow's impressive Speed stat allows it to outpace a variety of threats such as Keldeo, Latios, and non-Choice Scarf users such as Gengar and Greninja. Swellow's Flying typing allows it to come in on a resisted Bug- or Grass-type attack while also granting it immunity to Ground-type moves. Swellow also has a good coverage move in Heat Wave, which is great for checking Steel-types. Unfortunately, Swellow's lackluster bulk makes it easier to be KOed by priority and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users. Swellow's special movepool is very limited, leaving it with weak coverage options such as Hidden Power. Swellow's Flying typing also comes with a cost in giving it a Stealth Rock weakness, limiting its opportunities to switch in and use U-turn when needed. With average offenses, Swellow requires team support to effectively secure KOs, as it needs foes to be weakened by its teammates and entry hazards to clean effectively. It also faces huge competition from Mega Pidgeot, which fits on Normal teams more easily, is also able to outspeed threats under base 121 Speed, has a better STAB move in Hurricane, and comes with better bulk, making it less prone to being revenge killed.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Boomburst serves as Swellow's most powerful STAB attack, which deals enormous damage to threats that don't resist the move. Heat Wave is a decent coverage move that allows Swellow to hit Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, which resist Boomburst. Air Slash is a secondary STAB move able to OHKO Keldeo and Tapu Bulu after Stealth Rock damage. U-turn provides Swellow with momentum and allows it to function as a pivot, escaping unfavorable matchups for its teammates to handle them. Hidden Power Ground can be used instead of Air Slash to hit Heatran, which would otherwise wall Swellow.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature bolsters Swellow's Speed, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Latios, Gengar, and Greninja. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Choice Specs boost Swellow's capabilities as a cleaner and ensure it hits as hard as possible when wearing down its checks. Scrappy is necessary for Swellow to hit Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye and Alolan Marowak with a powerful Boomburst. Without Scrappy, Swellow would be forced to switch out once locked into Boomburst.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Swellow should spam Boomburst as much as possible thanks to its very high Base Power when combined with Choice Specs. With Swellow's Speed and powerful STAB move, it becomes a decent late-game cleaner and a wallbreaker. Don't be afraid to use Boomburst even if there's a threat that resists the attack because the move still does decent damage. Due to Swellow's lackluster bulk, it should be brought in after a fainted teammate, on a double switch, or via Volt Switch and U-turn. Swellow can function well as a lead due to its access to U-turn and its impressive Speed stat. Instead of aggressively attacking, it should utilize U-turn as a way to pivot out of threats that it can't break through or into a teammate that best takes on its checks and counters. Don't leave Swellow in on Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Greninja, and Victini, as they can all revenge kill it. Swellow should avoid Knock Off users because Choice Specs is the main reason why its attacks are strong. Once its Choice Specs is removed, Swellow will have difficulty cleaning and wallbreaking. Make sure to keep Swellow away from status such as poison and paralysis, as the former shortens its longevity on the field, and the latter ruins its ability to outspeed foes. Swellow should be wary of priority users such as Scizor, Mamoswine, Breloom, and Bisharp, as they can KO it. Swellow relies on entry hazards to secure KOs, so it's best to have them on the field as early as possible so the residual damage can make things easier for Swellow to remove threats from the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swellow needs entry hazard support in order to apply pressure on the opposing team, so Smeargle is a great partner, setting down Stealth Rock to make it easier to KO other threats and Sticky Web to help Swellow outpace grounded threats, which also allows it to run a Modest nature over Timid. Mega Lopunny is a great partner for Swellow thanks to its ability to break down special walls such as Alolan Muk, Steel-types such as Heatran, and Rock-types such as Tyranitar. Meloetta and Porygon-Z are great options for Swellow. Porygon-Z serves as a special sweeper and helps Swellow check Fighting teams effectively and dismantle offensive teams. Meloetta, especially a Choice Specs variant, is a great wallbreaker to apply pressure alongside Swellow against defensive teams. Meloetta can also assist Swellow in taking on Fighting teams. Heliolisk creates a VoltTurn core with Swellow, as both can pivot in and out to each other while applying pressure when Stealth Rock and Sticky Web are on the field. Heliolisk can also check Flying- and Water-types such as Skarmory and Empoleon. Staraptor makes for a great partner for Swellow, as it can apply pressure on specially defensive walls and help during Fighting matchups that Swellow would have trouble against. Diggersby is another great partner for Swellow, being able to take on Rock- and Steel-types such as Nihilego, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Thanks to its ability Huge Power, Diggersby becomes a nice physical wallbreaker. Ditto is a fantastic partner for Swellow, checking strong setup sweepers such as Dragonite and performing as a great revenge killer to offensive threats.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Pelipper's ability Drizzle is a blessing to rain teams, as it single-handedly enables them to function. Pelipper's Flying typing along with a Hurricane that does not miss in rain allows it to deal with problematic Grass-types, most notably Mega Venusaur, as well as Fighting- and Bug-types. Its high Base Power STAB moves allow it to have a threatening offensive presence with Choice Specs and rip through many common walls like Celesteela, Mega Sableye, and Toxapex. Pelipper's decent defensive typing also allows it to run a defensive set despite its lackluster bulk to check some physical threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade. However, it should be noted that Pelipper's offensive sets are incredibly frail due to the lack of investment in bulk. Coupled with its low Speed, offensive Pelipper is unable to reliably check faster threats like Mega Diancie and Terrakion. While it is valued as a Defogger, having to switch into entry hazards to remove them makes Pelipper rather unreliable due to its weakness to Stealth Rock. Thus, despite being a staple on rain teams, Pelipper is very underwhelming, making it hard to justify using outside of rain-oriented teams.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane allows Pelipper to eliminate walls that rain teams generally have a hard time breaking through such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Hydro Pump helps Pelipper deal massive damage to walls such as Mega Sableye, Porygon2, and Celesteela. U-turn allows Pelipper to act as a pivot to gain momentum and give teammates a free switch. Defog lets Pelipper help the team clear entry hazards such as Sticky Web, which hinders even Swift Swim users. It also clears Stealth Rock to let Pelipper switch in more often without worry.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Drizzle supports the team with rain while boosting Pelipper's own moves. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Pelipper to be as fast as possible. 252 EVs in Special Attack with Choice Specs allow Pelipper to hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature can also be used to hit harder, but then Pelipper fails to outspeed threats like Adamant Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pelipper should be used early to dismantle opposing defensive cores with Hurricane + Hydro Pump, a move combination unresisted by most of the metagame. Getting rain up early also enables teammates such as Mega Swampert and Kingdra to become immediate threats. Send Pelipper in whenever rain ends to continue supporting Pokemon that can take advantage of it. Keep Pelipper alive to get as many rain turns as possible, especially in matchups like Electric, where Drizzle support is the key to winning. U-turn should be used on expected switches to gain momentum or switch out on slower foes like Cradily and Tyranitar that heavily pressure Pelipper. Keeping track of remaining rain turns is vital to the success of rain teams. Avoid switching Pelipper in when there is still a turn of rain up, as this essentially wastes its Drizzle and may lead to it taking unnecessary damage. That said, Pelipper works best with rain, so do not be afraid to utilize it while rain is up. Avoid sacrificing Pelipper early unless the remaining rain turns can help teammates win the game. Switch into Stealth Rock users that Pelipper can force out such as Swampert and Hippowdon to use Defog without having to take damage from Stealth Rock. Avoid getting statused, as any chip damage can be the difference between Pelipper coming safely in or fainting to Stealth Rock, and paralysis halves Pelipper's already horrible Speed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Swampert is a fantastic teammate, as it can take advantage of Pelipper's Drizzle with its ability Swift Swim to become an incredibly powerful and fast sweeper. Swampert's Ground typing also lets it absorb Electric-type attacks and deal with Electric-type Pokemon with STAB Earthquake. It also gets Stealth Rock to chip foes, giving a teammate or even itself an easier time cleaning up late-game. Keldeo appreciates Pelipper's rain to boost its already powerful Water-type STAB moves to immense levels. Pelipper also helps get rid of walls that Keldeo cannot deal with such as Toxapex and deal with Grass-type Pokemon. In return, Keldeo takes on Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Chansey. Toxapex is a fantastic defensive pivot that can set up Toxic Spikes to wear down opposing walls and wall offensive threats such as Terrakion. In return, Pelipper provides a Ground immunity. Manaphy acts as both a secondary source of rain and potent special sweeper for rain teams with Z-Rain Dance. It can also make use of its wide coverage to patch up weaknesses in the team. Greninja works as a revenge killer to deal with the likes of Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko without the reliance on rain. This alleviates pressure from Pelipper to come in every time rain is gone and helps prevent opponents from exploiting the team's reliance on rain. Greninja also greatly appreciates the removal of Mega Venusaur. Kingdra is another Swift Swim user that can become a strong sweeper in rain. Seismitoad can also take advantage of the rain with Swift Swim, performs a similar role to Mega Swampert as an Electric-immune sweeper, and is able to set Stealth Rock, freeing up a moveslot for Mega Swampert to run other coverage moves. Lastly, Azumarill's rain-boosted Aqua Jet is very hard to deal with after a Belly Drum, and it can make use of Pelipper's U-turn to get in safely.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald allows Pelipper to potentially burn foes while dealing decent damage with the rain boost. Hurricane synergizes nicely with Drizzle to allow Pelipper to beat threats like Mega Lopunny and Mega Venusaur. Roost keeps Pelipper healthy throughout the battle so it can come in to set rain multiple times. Defog is useful to get rid of entry hazards. U-turn provides a slow pivot to give offensive Pokemon such as Mega Swampert that can take advantage of rain a free switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Drizzle provides rain for the team as Pelipper switches in and is the only ability it should be using. Maximum investment in HP and Defense along with a Bold nature allows Pelipper to be as bulky as possible. Leftovers gives Pelipper passive recovery to further increase its longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pelipper is usually safe to lead in order to get rain up early and pressure some common leads like Garchomp and Mega Lopunny. However, beware of slower weather setters, such as Hippowdon and Torkoal, and Mega Charizard Y, as they can replace Pelipper's rain with their own weather. U-turn should be used frequently to get an ally in safely to take advantage of the limited rain turns. Scald should also be used often if the opponent is not immediately pressured by your sweepers. Keep Pelipper healthy throughout the battle with Roost and remove Stealth Rock whenever possible so it can switch in more easily. Switch Pelipper into Stealth Rock users it can beat like Garchomp and Swampert to catch them on the turn they try to get Stealth Rock up, allowing Pelipper to force them out and Defog Stealth Rock away without taking damage from it. Avoid letting Pelipper be statused by moves such as Scald and Toxic, as they can severely hamper Pelipper's ability to wall or switch into threats due to its underwhelming base stats. Despite its weakness to Electric-type attacks, Pelipper is vital in the Electric matchup thanks to its rain support making Mega Swampert a massive threat to Electric teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Swampert is the best Swift Swim user to pair with Pelipper, as it grants the team an Electric immunity and has access to Stealth Rock. Toxapex works well with Pelipper as another pivot to take pressure off Pelipper, as having to take damage while using U-turn hinders Pelipper's ability to check certain threats like Garchomp. It is also a reliable switch-in to a majority of the metagame and appreciates Pelipper's ability to come in on Ground-type attacks. Taunt Keldeo can help get rid of walls Pelipper has trouble with like Mega Sableye, Porygon2, and Alolan Muk, while Pelipper gets rid of troublesome Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu. Greninja is a fantastic revenge killer that does not rely on rain to outspeed foes. It can help the team deal with Choice Scarf Pokemon that can threaten Mega Swampert such as Latios and Gengar. Manaphy is a strong setup sweeper that can also help set up rain in the event Pelipper is unable to. Strong coverage moves along with Tail Glow enable Manaphy to deal with walls that defensive Pelipper fails to like Zapdos and Gastrodon. Manaphy's ability Hydration also allows it to soak up status moves for the team with rain up. An alternative Defogger like Rotom-W or Empoleon can help, especially if Pelipper forgoes Defog, to take pressure off Pelipper and let it switch in on threats more easily.</p> "

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <p>With powerful priority in Technician-boosted Mach Punch, high Attack, and Spore, Breloom finds its way onto most Fighting teams. Technician greatly boosts the power of moves with a Base Power of 60 or less, such as Bullet Seed, Mach Punch, and Rock Tomb, all of which Breloom uses. It also has near-perfect neutral coverage with those attacks, enabling it to deal significant damage to most Pokemon. Spore has perfect accuracy and cripples threats by putting them to sleep, effectively removing them from the battle until they wake up. In addition, Breloom's Grass typing makes it a great wincon against Water teams, and it can deal with annoying bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Tapu Fini. It can also choose to use Swords Dance to sweep weakened teams late-game. Although Breloom has a poor Speed stat, it has powerful priority in Mach Punch to make up for it. However, it is still unable to beat foes that resist Mach Punch, like Gyarados. It also has low defenses, and its defensive typing hinders Fighting teams more than it helps, as it offers no useful resistances and exacerbates weaknesses.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>Breloom is a strong physical attacker for Grass with access to a great ability in Technician combined with a very high Attack stat and a good offensive typing. Breloom has a potent movepool to make use of Technician: Mach Punch provides a strong priority attack for Grass teams, Rock Tomb offers valuable coverage for Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types, and Bullet Seed is a powerful wallbreaking option, especially with Grassy Terrain support. Furthermore, with Swords Dance, Breloom is capable of cleaning weakened teams with Mach Punch late-game. Breloom also has excellent utility in Spore, which can cripple a Pokemon by putting it to sleep, offering Grass a semi-reliable method of forcing out threats, checking dangerous sweepers, and creating opportunities to set up with Swords Dance. However, Breloom is frail and has an exploitable defensive typing with weaknesses to common Ice-, Fire-, Flying-, Poison-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type attacks, making it easy to revenge kill. Breloom is also slow and very reliant on Mach Punch to threaten fast offensive threats.</p> ",

However, this comes in exchange for the guaranteed setup opportunities Focus Sash provides, which Grass greatly appreciates. Rockium Z with Stone Edge is a decent wallbreaking option that circumvents common Breloom checks such as Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Scizor. However, it almost mandates the use of Swords Dance, limiting Breloom's moveslots even further, and offers less broad utility than Focus Sash.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur is the best available Breloom counter, as it resists both of Breloom's STAB moves, is immune to Spore, can recover off the negligible damage it takes from Rock Tomb with Synthesis, and threatens to OHKO Breloom with Sludge Bomb.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore puts foes to sleep, which can force the foe to switch out and result in a free turn to switch into a teammate or set up Swords Dance. Bullet Seed is an incredibly strong STAB move that is boosted by Technician. Mach Punch is powerful priority that is also boosted by Technician and allows Breloom to sweep teams once Fighting-resistant Pokemon are weakened, as well as effectively revenge kill. Rock Tomb hits Flying-types that resist Breloom's STAB moves like Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y, is boosted by Technician, and lowers the foe's Speed. Swords Dance is an option instead of Rock Tomb that boosts Breloom's Attack to sweep weakened teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The chosen EV spread maximizes Breloom's Attack and Speed. Adamant can be used for more power, while Jolly can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Dragonite and Speed tie with other positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon. Focus Sash ensures Breloom lives an attack if it is at full health and can use Spore in return. Technician boosts Breloom's attacks that are weaker than 60 Base Power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Leading with Breloom and using Spore against opposing leads can generate momentum. However, Breloom can also be saved for late-game as a last resort against a sweeper with its Focus Sash. Switching Breloom out after using Spore can safely bring in wallbreaking teammates such as Keldeo. Instead of switching after using Spore, Breloom can use the free turn to set up with Swords Dance. Don't switch Breloom into attacks because that will break its Focus Sash, and it will also take significant damage from even resisted attacks. Instead, try switching it in after a teammate has fainted. Use Rock Tomb on would-be switch-ins like Latios to lower their Speed and use Spore to put them to sleep the turn after. Status moves, especially burn, will cripple Breloom for the entirety of the battle. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards will break Breloom's Focus Sash, so try to prevent them from being set with Taunt from Cobalion or Infernape.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Both Keldeo and Terrakion can switch into Breloom's Fire-type checks like Volcarona. Keldeo can break through physical walls like Skarmory, and Terrakion can deal with Flying-types like Zapdos, while Breloom can KO the Water-types that switch into Keldeo and Terrakion like Slowbro. Breloom can also use Spore to cripple their checks like Latios and Doublade. Mega Gallade can take advantage of Spore and is also capable of breaking many of Breloom's checks such as Mega Venusaur. Heracross eliminates troubling Psychic-types that stop Breloom in its tracks like Mew. Both Heracross and Terrakion can revenge kill annoying wallbreakers that force Breloom out like Mega Charizard Y. Cobalion and Infernape can both set up Stealth Rock, are neutral to Fairy, and can Taunt opposing entry hazard setters to preserve Breloom's Focus Sash. Cobalion is bulkier, neutral to Flying, can use Volt Switch to bring Breloom in safely, and can use Thunder Wave to cripple foes that would otherwise be able to revenge kill Breloom. Infernape is much more offensive and beats Breloom's Steel-type checks like Mega Scizor and Doublade with its Fire-type STAB moves. Hawlucha and Lucario can handle Breloom's Grass- and Fairy-type checks, respectively, and both can set up with Swords Dance on foes that have been put to sleep by Spore. Mega Heracross, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole can break through walls that trouble Breloom like Mega Venusaur and Jirachi.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore cripples one Pokemon by putting it to sleep and is the main utility Breloom provides. Mach Punch is a Fighting-type STAB priority move that is boosted by Technician, letting Breloom check frail threats and clean weakened teams late-game. Bullet Seed is also boosted by Technician and is Breloom's most powerful attack. Rock Tomb offers coverage against Bug-, Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-types that resist Breloom's STAB attacks such as Volcarona, Crobat, and Mega Charizard Y. Swords Dance boosts Breloom's Attack stat and can be run over Rock Tomb if the coverage is unneeded.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Breloom to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Breloom to be as fast as possible. Jolly allows Breloom to outspeed threats such as Mamoswine and defensive Staraptor, but Adamant is also an option. Technician boosts Breloom's two primary STAB moves and coverage options. Focus Sash gives Breloom a guaranteed opportunity to attack or cripple a threat with Spore while at full health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bullet Seed is Breloom's strongest attack and should be used to break down walls and punch through teams. If Rock Tomb is being run, use it to punish switch-ins such as Latios, which would otherwise easily check Breloom. Use Mach Punch to revenge kill frail offensive threats such as Greninja and Diggersby or clean late-game. If Swords Dance is being run, it should be used either against sleeping foes, or against very passive walls that cannot touch Breloom such as Chansey, or on a forced switch, as Breloom's bulk is very poor and it cannot take hits from anything. Try to remove Pokemon that resist Mach Punch before setting up, as they can easily end the sweep by outspeeding and KOing Breloom. Spore can let Breloom act as an anti-lead to disable Pokemon such as Shuckle and Skarmory. However, Spore generally should be saved to cripple Breloom's checks or threats to the team in general, such as Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Celesteela. Likewise, make sure to preserve Focus Sash in matchups where Breloom may need to check a sweepers such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, or Salamence. For this reason, be wary of entry hazards, status, and weather, as they break Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is the backbone of Grass's defensive core that Breloom falls back on when faced with Pokemon it cannot beat. Mega Venusaur's high bulk, typing, and ability provide valuable neutralities to Bug-, Poison-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks. Cradily is Grass's second best Fire sponge and a standard Stealth Rock setter. It also is capable of checking special attackers that are threats to Breloom and the type at large, such as Quiver Dance Volcarona. Ferrothorn helps support Breloom by making up part of the amazing defensive core Breloom relies upon to wear down opposing teams, with its excellent Grass / Steel typing providing an immunity to Poison-type attacks and neutralities to Flying-, Bug-, and Ice-type attacks. Ferrothorn's Spikes is invaluable and can be stacked to wear down checks to Swords Dance Breloom. Tapu Bulu is an amazing teammate for Breloom that acts as an excellent blanket revenge killer with Choice Scarf and brings Grassy Terrain support to boost Breloom's STAB Bullet Seed. Grassy Terrain's passive recovery can even reactivate Breloom's Focus Sash if it is broken by Stealth Rock. Celebi is a strong special attacker that offers valuable Psychic-type STAB coverage to manage Poison-type threats such as Nidoking, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur that Breloom struggles with. Rotom-C is a solid pivot and revenge killer for Grass teams that can serve as a soft check to threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Pinsir when holding a Choice Scarf and Rotom-C can bring in Breloom safely with Volt Switch. Whimsicott can support Breloom by providing speed control with Prankster Stun Spore and by disabling setup sweepers with Encore. Its Fairy-type STAB coverage is particularly helpful against Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Latios, which often wall Breloom. Serperior is a fast special sweeper that can make use of the holes Breloom punches in teams with Contrary Leaf Storm.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Dark</h1> <p>Mega Sableye's ability, Magic Bounce, allows it to shut down entry hazard setters such as Chansey and Ferrothorn and support teammates by switching in to prevent status such as Toxic. This is especially useful against bulkier teams, as Mega Sableye's teammates get worn down extremely easily without it. Access to Will-O-Wisp in conjunction with Prankster before it Mega Evolves also allows it to cripple physical attackers such as Mega Gallade and Landorus-T. Mega Sableye's Ghost typing gives it an important immunity to Fighting, which allows it to come in on Fighting-types such as Hawlucha and Terrakion and other Pokemon locked into Fighting-type attacks. Furthermore, Mega Sableye has solid defensive stats along with reliable recovery, allowing it to wall offensive threats such as Nidoking. It can also stall out bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Mantine by running Toxic over Foul Play. Any entry hazards, though, especially Toxic Spikes, seriously compromise Mega Sableye's ability to wall Pokemon and provide utility. Mega Sableye's passive nature also allows Pokemon such as Calm Mind Suicune to set up on it and prevents it from doing much work against offensive teams. Mega Sableye is a huge momentum drain and can even have competition with other Mega Evolutions such as Mega Sharpedo for players hoping to keep up momentum. Mega Sharpedo can also wallbreak and can beat Fighting-types that Mega Sableye can't deal with such as Keldeo, and Mega Tyranitar can give you favorable matchups against Flying and Fairy. Pokemon immune to burn such as Volcarona and wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y can blow right past Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Mega Sableye serves as an exceptional mixed defensive wall for Ghost-type teams, and its bulk is complemented by reliable recovery in the form of Recover. Mega Sableye's incredible defensive stats allow it to take hard hits from powerful threats like Mega Sharpedo and Blacephalon and burn or KO them. Furthermore, an exceptional Dark / Ghost typing means that Mega Sableye provides Ghost teams with a Psychic immunity and takes neutral damage from the Ghost type's two main weaknesses: Ghost and Dark, allowing it to switch into Gengar and Alolan Muk. Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce ability allows it to reflect all forms of entry hazards and status moves, protecting its teammates from being withered down by residual damage. Before Mega Evolving, Sableye has the Prankster ability, which allows it to take advantage of its amazing utility moves like Will-O-Wisp to immediately neuter Pokemon like Scizor, and Mega Pinsir. However, Mega Sableye relies heavily on utility moves and lacks an offensive presence, which makes it susceptible to becoming setup bait for special sweepers that do not fear Will-O-Wisp, such as Suicune and Volcarona. Furthermore, although Mega Sableye has solid bulk, it is easily broken by the tier's most impressive wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko. Mega Sableye's abysmal Speed prevents it from quickly burning threats or removing items from wallbreakers like Diggersby.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p>Protect lets Sableye safely Mega Evolve into Mega Sableye against threats such as Mega Diancie. It also lets Mega Sableye scout against threatening Choice-locked threats such as Diggersby. Toxic can enable Mega Sableye to wear down defensive threats such as Porygon2, but Foul Play will generally be more useful and other teammates like Mandibuzz and Alolan Muk can easily provide this status move instead. A set of Calm Mind / Will-O-Wisp / Recover and Shadow Ball or Dark Pulse with a physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature turns Mega Sableye into a potent setup sweeper. However, Calm Mind only worsens Mega Sableye's inability to counter wallbreakers and completely falls on its face against types such as Water and Poison, where Foul Play would be preferred.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>A Calm Mind set with maximized Defense EVs instead of mixed defenses and an offensive move like Snarl or Dark Pulse allows Mega Sableye to become a tank and deal with special attackers. However, it is easily phazed and cannot comfortably set up on numerous wallbreakers such as Landorus and Mega Charizard Y. Toxic allows it to whittle down bulky Pokemon that do not care about being burned like Mandibuzz and Porygon2, but this requires losing a utility move that is much more useful such as Will-O-Wisp or Protect. Metal Burst allows Mega Sableye to catch threatening wallbreakers like Mega Diancie off guard and take them out, but it is very situational and less reliable compared to its arsenal of utility moves.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Pokemon: Mold Breaker users such as Excadrill can set up entry hazards against Mega Sableye and even cripple it with Toxic. Setup sweepers with access to Mold Breaker Taunt such as Mega Gyarados threaten it as well.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko can easily beat Mega Sableye one-on-one or outright KO it after some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona and Calm Mind Suicune can freely set up on Mega Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo, Choice Band Diggersby, and Mega Charizard Y tear through Mega Sableye with a bit of prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes: Toxic Spikes from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Nidoqueen greatly threaten Mega Sableye, as poison wears it down very easily, especially in conjunction with other entry hazards.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Sableye is unable to effectively threaten Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Diancie and is OHKOed or 2HKOed by their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Suicune are able to comfortably set up on Mega Sableye because they are not threatened by being burned or hit by Foul Play and can carry moves like Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: If poisoned by Toxic Spikes, Alolan Muk's Poison Touch, or any poison inducing move, Mega Sableye is crippled.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Excadrill is able to set up Stealth Rock on Mega Sableye and use Toxic on it, while Mega Gyarados can Taunt it before freely setting up to clean the team.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko are able to break Mega Sableye without being threatened by it.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off allows Mega Sableye to cripple Pokemon that rely on their item such as Chansey. Will-O-Wisp allow Mega Sableye to cripple physical attackers. Foul Play discourages all physical setup from Pokemon such as Mega Scizor. Recover gives Mega Sableye reliable recovery, allowing it to switch into entry hazards and weaker attacks without being worn down as easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP allow Mega Sableye to maximize its bulk. 144 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature allow Mega Sableye to soak up attacks from Pokemon such as Sheer Force Nidoking. 112 Defense EVs let Mega Sableye switch into threatening Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Terrakion. Prankster allows Sableye to hit offensive Pokemon with a priority Will-O-Wisp before it Mega Evolves. Sableye needs Sablenite to Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In some matchups, it can be very beneficial to lead with Sableye and Mega Evolve right away so you can later freely switch it in to prevent entry hazards from Pokemon such as Chansey and Skarmory. It also outright beats other common leads such as Cobalion and Shuckle. Switch Mega Sableye into common hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex to bounce back hazards, and switch it into status users such as Gastrodon and Zapdos to cripple them. Preserve Mega Sableye's health and play carefully against types such as Fighting and Normal, where it is extremely important to check threatening Pokemon or prevent hazards. Use Will-O-Wisp liberally against teams with multiple strong physical attackers, as the opponent might try doubling into one. However, keep in mind that the opponent might switch in a wall that appreciates being burned instead of badly poisoned or into a Fire-type such as Volcarona. Other Pokemon, such as Heatran, can switch in freely to take advantage of Flash Fire if Mega Sableye uses Will-O-Wisp. Make sure to prioritize Knock Off over other moves against Pokemon that rely on their item such as Porygon2 and offensive threats like Choice Band Tapu Bulu. Use Recover liberally, as a worn-down Mega Sableye loses its ability to check threats. Use Foul Play against setup Pokemon such as Hawlucha and Mega Pinsir. However, be careful against teams carrying Pokemon with the ability Justified, as they might try to switch in for the free Attack boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mandibuzz can use Defog to remove hazards that lower Mega Sableye's defensive potential and can switch into threats such as Mega Lopunny and Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Choice Band Diggersby. Tyranitar has access to Stealth Rock to wear down sweepers and beats extremely threatening setup sweepers such as Volcarona, which fearlessly sets up against Mega Sableye. Greninja is a great offensive check to Pokemon such as Keldeo and Tapu Koko. Alolan Muk supports Mega Sableye by pressuring Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Koko. Bisharp takes out problematic Fairy-types such as Clefable, while Mega Sableye blocks status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave aimed at Bisharp. Bisharp can also pressure Defoggers that can freely pivot and use Defog against Mega Sableye with its ability Defiant. Krookodile can set up Stealth Rock to pressure the opposition, and Mega Sableye can spinblock for it. Krookodile can also beat defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, which trouble Mega Sableye. Choice Specs Hydreigon can take out Pokemon that threaten Mega Sableye such as Mega Venusaur and Heatran. Choice Scarf Flash Cannon Hydreigon can take out other threats such as Mega Diancie.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover gives Mega Sableye longevity, thus enabling it to fulfill its role as a mixed wall more efficiently. Will-O-Wisp allows it to burn physical attackers, which cripples them and makes walling them much easier. Knock Off can be used to cripple bulky and offensive Pokemon alike by removing their items such as Black Sludge from Toxapex and Life Orb from Landorus. Protect allows Mega Sableye to do three things: safely Mega Evolve against threats such as Mega Diancie, scout moves against Choice-locked attackers like Victini, and force High Jump Kick mind games against Mega Lopunny. Foul Play punishes physical setup sweepers, especially some like Mega Charizard X and Substitute users like Gyarados that can circumvent Will-O-Wisp. Fake Out can be used instead of Protect to Mega Evolve against threats and get some residual damage on the opposing team while preventing them from recovering or setting up on a predicted Protect. However, it can only be used on the first turn in and does not help Mega Sableye beat answers like Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs maximize Mega Sableye's bulk while minimizing potential Stealth Rock damage. 104 Defense EVs give Mega Sableye the ability to take powerful physical attacks like Stakataka's Continental Crush. 156 Special Defense EVs supported by a Careful nature allow Mega Sableye to handle special attackers, even surviving Mega Diancie's Moonblast. Magic Bounce allows Mega Sableye to shut down entry hazard setters and status spreaders. Prankster gives Sableye the possibility to use its utility moves with priority before Mega Evolution.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, especially in matchups where entry hazards must be avoided at all costs like against Poison and Steel. Use Protect when Mega Evolving against powerful wallbreakers and other threats like Mold Breaker Excadrill. Also, Protect should also be used to scout moves from Choice-locked attackers like Victini and switch out to the appropriate check if needed. Additonally, Protect can force Mega Lopunny to miss High Jump Kick and take crash damage and stall out Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y. While Mega Evolving early is important, Sableye can forego this to get important burns with Prankster Will-O-Wisp. After getting off a priority burn, Sableye can take advantage of Prankster to get priority recovery. Will-O-Wisp should be used to cripple physical attackers; however, it risks letting in threats like Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Mega Sableye should be kept healthy so that it can safely come in often. It should switch in on common hazard setters and status spreaders like Toxapex and Ferrothorn but avoid those that threaten it like Heatran and Clefable. If running Foul Play, spam it against physical setup sweepers like Gyarados and Scizor. Take advantage of opposing walls like Chansey and Toxapex to Recover. Avoid being burned by opposing Magic Bounce or Mew's Synchronize because this greatly hinders Knock Off and Foul Play's damage output.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Blacephalon can be either an amazing wallbreaker or a sweeper to handle the more offensive threats that Mega Sableye cannot such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko. In return, Mega Sableye allows Blacephalon to come in more often by preventing residual damage from entry hazards, and it can take the Ghost- and Dark-type attacks that would KO Blacephalon. Other sets like Choice Specs are also able to accomplish this, but they cannot beat fast threats like Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko. Gengar is another offensive Pokemon that assists Mega Sableye by providing an offensive presence to take out threats, such as Clefable and, if running Choice Scarf, Tapu Koko. Gengar is also able to remove Toxic Spikes, which is necessary because Toxapex beats Mega Sableye one-on-one if it gets poisoned. Mimikyu can clean up Dark-types that Mega Sableye has weakened during the battle. It also functions as a blanket check against setup sweepers that Mega Sableye cannot beat such as Volcarona, Refresh Mega Altaria, and Taunt Mega Gyarados. Alolan Marowak and Golurk can set up Stealth Rock and check Electric-types like Tapu Koko to support Mega Sableye. Jellicent provides a Water-type immunity to aid Mega Sableye against threats like Suicune and Keldeo. Decidueye assists Mega Sableye by removing hazards like Toxic Spikes and trapping defensive threats like Mantine with Spirit Shackle.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Mega Manectric is one of the best offensive pivots available to Electric-type teams, along with Tapu Koko, featuring blazing fast Speed that allows it to outrun nearly the entire unboosted metagame. It has access to Volt Switch, enabling Mega Manectric to act as a fast pivot to bring in its defensive teammates. Using Mega Manectric takes the pressure off Tapu Koko to act as an offensive pivot, allowing it to run U-turn to more readily switch out of opposing Pokemon, including Ground-types. Mega Manectric's coverage combination of Overheat and Hidden Power Ice also allows Tapu Koko to utilize Grass Knot, which it typically cannot afford to run. Mega Manectric takes advantage of its strong Fire-type coverage to heavily threaten opposing Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu, which can otherwise be very tricky to deal with. Its ability, Intimidate, allows Mega Manectric to take on physical attackers more readily, notably surviving attacks such as Wood Hammer from Tapu Bulu. Intimidate also further bolsters its ability to bring in teammates, like Zapdos, by weakening physical attackers. Still, Mega Manectric's lackluster bulk makes it very vulnerable to most attackers, and it can be very quickly worn down from entry hazards through the course of the battle. It also often competes to fill the same teamslot with Pokemon such as Magnezone, Thundurus, and Xurkitree, each of which fill a different offensive niche for the team, handling different matchups more effectively.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch is one of the key features of using Mega Manectric, allowing it to quickly pivot out of foes into teammates that can more readily handle them. Thunderbolt is Mega Manectric's most spammable attack, hitting many foes hard with its great Special Attack. Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Manectric to hit Ground-types that are immune to its STAB attacks such as Landorus and Garchomp as well as Dragon-types such as Latios and Dragonite. Overheat is a very powerful Fire-type attack, allowing Mega Manectric to blast back Steel- and Grass-types such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Celebi. Flamethrower is an alternative to Overheat, as it doesn't reduce Mega Manectric's Special Attack after a hit, as well as having 100% accuracy. However, the drop in Base Power is noticeable in missing several OHKOs such as against Excadrill and specially defensive Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed along with a Timid nature allows Mega Manectric to be as fast as possible, allowing it to Speed tie Mega Lopunny as well as outspeed Pokemon such as Greninja and +1 Mega Tyranitar. Maximum Special Attack enables Mega Manectric to be as strong as possible, while 4 Special Defense EVs are used so opposing Download Pokemon such as Porygon2 do not get a Special Attack boost. Lightning Rod allows Manectric to switch into predicted Electric-type attacks such as Volt Switch and gain a Special Attack boost before Mega Evolving. Manectite grants Manectric the ability to Mega Evolve, boosting its stats greatly. After Mega Evolving, Mega Manectric gains the ability Intimidate, lowering its foes' Attack by one stage upon switch in. This is very useful in conjunction with Volt Switch to disrupt slower physical attackers and bring in its defensive teammates more reliably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Mega Manectric is an offensive pivot, use Volt Switch liberally against teams that lack an Electric-immune Pokemon in order to keep Mega Manectric safe from attacks while whittling down opposing Pokemon and switching into its defensive teammates. Be sure to use Volt Switch against walls that Mega Manectric cannot take on such as Chansey in order to bring in a teammate that can deal with it such as Thundurus while gaining some chip damage. Bring Mega Manectric in on weak physical attackers such as Ferrothorn, as they do little damage after a drop in Attack from Intimidate while forcing it either to switch out or get OHKOed by Mega Manectric's Fire-type coverage. In addition, bring in Manectric before it Mega Evolves against Pokemon that commonly use Volt Switch such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos in order to disrupt their pivot and gain a Special Attack boost. However, be wary of their other coverage moves, as Manectric's poor bulk leads it to being worn down very quickly. Due to Mega Manectric's lackluster bulk, keep entry hazards off of the field as much as possible throughout the battle in order to preserve its health as it tries to pivot out. Thanks to its amazing Speed, utilize Mega Manectric to revenge kill slower threats such as Landorus and Choice Band Terrakion after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko forms an amazing pivot combo along with Mega Manectric, allowing them to chip down opposing Pokemon quickly with VoltTurn. Tapu Koko also sets Electric Terrain for Mega Manectric, amplifying its Electric-type attacks' power. Additionally, running Mega Manectric as an offensive pivot enables Tapu Koko to take advantage of moves that it normally cannot afford to run such as Grass Knot and U-turn. Rotom-W and Zapdos form a great defensive pair for Mega Manectric to pivot into, as they appreciate Mega Manectric's Intimidate to more readily absorb foes' attacks. Rotom-W can also utilize Will-O-Wisp to nullify physical attackers for Mega Manectric, and Zapdos can provide Defog support. Alolan Golem sets Stealth Rock for Mega Manectric, allowing it to further chip down foes upon switch in as they try to deal with Mega Manectric's ability to work as a fast pivot. Alolan Raichu is a fantastic revenge killer with amazing coverage options that takes on Pokemon that Mega Manectric cannot cover. Notably, it helps by dealing with Mega Venusaur, which walls all of Mega Manectric's attacks. Thundurus assists Mega Manectric by dealing with the troublesome Normal defensive core of Porygon2 and Chansey with Knock Off, which otherwise absorb all of Mega Manectric's attacks. It also acts as a strong physical attacker to take on other specially defensive Pokemon that Mega Manectric can not handle on its own like Cradily.</p> "

  "Sharpedo": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dark</h1> <p>Boasting high Attack and Speed, Mega Sharpedo is a staple sweeper on many Dark teams. It has Speed Boost before Mega Evolving, which allows it to sweep teams late-game, and it has Strong Jaw after Mega Evolving to make STAB Crunch hit incredibly hard. Mega Sharpedo has access to useful coverage moves such as Ice Fang and Psychic Fangs that are also boosted by Strong Jaw and hit its checks like Hydreigon and Keldeo. It works best on hyper offensive teams because it benefits a lot from the pressure and momentum its teammates employ on other threats. However, Mega Sharpedo requires the opposing team to be weakened for a successful sweep. It also needs boosts from Speed Boost, which requires it to run Protect, meaning that Sharpedo loses out on a necessary coverage move. It is quite frail and has difficulty taking even resisted attacks. Finally, status effects like paralysis and burn can easily prevent Mega Sharpedo from sweeping.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Mega Sharpedo has an amazing matchup against Psychic, one of the best types, and is able to act as a late-game sweeper thanks to Speed Boost before Mega Evolving. It also has great offensive stats and Strong Jaw after Mega Evolving. An unresisted dual STAB combination, coverage moves like Psychic Fangs and Ice Fang boosted by Strong Jaw, and exceptional offensive stats allow Mega Sharpedo to double as a wallbreaker. A good Speed tier after Mega Evolving lets it come in and revenge kill Pokemon like Swords Dance Garchomp without boosting its Speed. However, a mediocre defensive typing and below-average bulk prevent Mega Sharpedo from coming in on even weak attacks, limiting its opportunity to switch in. Being forced to run Protect has positives, like being able to scout, but is mostly outweighed by negatives, mainly not being able to run another coverage move. Mega Sharpedo having a crippling weakness to every type of status severely hinders its effectiveness as well. Mega Sharpedo is also mostly limited to late-game because after Mega Evolving, it doesn't have access to Speed Boost, which handicaps its cleaning potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p>A set with Life Orb and Hydro Pump / Crunch / Ice Beam / Protect can be used; however, it is noticeably weaker and is outclassed by other special attackers like Greninja and Hydreigon.

However, both of these require Mega Sharpedo to forgo a valuable coverage option.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Ice Fang is most notably applicable in the Dragon matchup, as it allows Mega Sharpedo to more easily pressure Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Hydreigon. Hydro Pump allows Mega Sharpedo to more easily pressure Skarmory + Zapdos cores without having to rely on getting Defense drops against Skarmory. It also lets Mega Sharpedo reliably 2HKO physically defensive Hippowdon. If you decide to utilize this option, make sure to dump the last 4 EVs into Special Attack and change Sharpedo's nature to Naive. Substitute gives Mega Sharpedo an edge against Psychic-type teams, giving Mega Sharpedo a reliable way of beating Focus Sash + Counter Alakazam as well as making it extremely hard to revenge kill after a couple of Speed boosts. It also improves Mega Sharpedo's matchup against offense, as if you can position it in order to freely get a Substitute up, it becomes very hard to beat. However, this forces Mega Sharpedo to drop a coverage move, preventing it from being as useful in other matchups. An Adamant nature lets Mega Sharpedo act as more of a wallbreaker and immediately OHKO Pokemon such as Xurkitree.

Try to avoid switching Sharpedo directly into attacks because of its poor defenses. Instead, bring it in safely with U-turn or after a teammate faints. Protect is not only used for gaining a Speed Boost but can also be used to scout for coverage moves or avoid damage from Fake Out users. Although using Protect two turns in a row only has a one-in-three chance of being successful, it is necessary to gain an extra Speed Boost against Choice Scarf users like Terrakion and Gengar. Avoid letting Mega Sharpedo get hit by status moves and keeping it in against common status spreaders like Mew and Porygon2 because a Will-O-Wisp from the former or a Thunder Wave from the latter can prevent Mega Sharpedo from successfully sweeping.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bisharp resists Grass, can KO most Fairy-types with Iron Head, and shares many of the same checks and counters as Sharpedo, allowing one to weaken them and the other to sweep. Hydreigon resists Electric and Grass and can punch holes through physical walls like Swampert, making it easier for Mega Sharpedo to sweep. Greninja can deal with many of Mega Sharpedo's checks with various coverage moves, notably Extrasensory to hit Mega Venusaur. This also allows Sharpedo to use Ice Fang instead of Psychic Fangs. Mandibuzz is neutral to Bug and Fighting and resists Grass, and it can pivot into many physical attacks aimed at Sharpedo as well as use Defog to remove entry hazards. It can use U-turn to safely bring in Sharpedo as well. Tyranitar can pivot into most special attacks with relative ease as well as set Stealth Rock, which can provide valuable chip damage and put foes in range of being KOed by Mega Sharpedo. Krookodile is another Stealth Rock setter that is a check to Electric-types. Alolan Muk is an excellent check to Fairy-types and can also beat Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect allows Sharpedo to gain Speed boosts against offensive teams more easily prior to Mega Evolving. Protect also lets Sharpedo scout against Choice-locked Pokemon. Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch is potentially Mega Sharpedo's strongest attack and comes with a nifty chance to drop the foe's Defense stat. Mega Sharpedo's secondary STAB move, Liquidation, retains Crunch's secondary effect but has a lower damage output due to it not being boosted by Strong Jaw. Psychic Fangs allows Mega Sharpedo to beat Poison-types, mainly Toxapex, that would otherwise wall it. It also has the niche of being able to take out other threatening Poison- and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo. Psychic Fangs breaks screens as well, effectively preventing Pokemon such as Klefki from fulfilling their niche.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sharpedonite allows Sharpedo to Mega Evolve. 252 Speed EVs allow Mega Sharpedo to be as fast as possible, and a Jolly nature lets it outpace Choice Scarf users like Victini at +1. 252 Attack EVs maximize Mega Sharpedo's damage output. Speed Boost increases Mega Sharpedo's cleaning potential against teams carrying revenge killers and improves its matchup against offensive teams but can only be used before Mega Evolving. Strong Jaw boosts Crunch and Psychic Fangs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If you know Sharpedo will be forced out by a Pokemon like Dragonite or Breloom, then it is wiser to not Mega Evolve so it can take advantage of Speed Boost later on. Keep Mega Sharpedo healthy by being wary of entry hazards and not switching it directly into attacks that are not Psychic-type. Don't worry about getting Speed boosts against bulky teams, as Sharpedo usually outpaces everything without boosting. Instead, capitalize on Mega Sharpedo's wallbreaking power by Mega Evolving early. Try to position Mega Sharpedo against Pokemon it forces out so as to take full advantage of Speed Boost. For example, position Mega Sharpedo against a Pokemon like Heatran or Choice Scarf Greninja locked into Dark Pulse to gain a free turn and use an attack as they switch out so Sharpedo can reliably use Protect the subsequent turn. Preserve Sharpedo for the late-game, as it is most effective when it hasn't wasted Speed Boost. Play carefully against types such as Psychic carrying Colbur Berry users like Slowbro and Mew, as Slowbro can cripple Mega Sharpedo with Grass Knot or Thunder Wave and Mew cripples it with Will-O-Wisp. Use Protect to scout against Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios and Diggersby so you can take advantage of potential momentum. For example, capitalize on a Diggersby locked into Earthquake with Ground-immune Pokemon like Mantine and Gyarados. Play carefully against status users like Chansey, as they hinder Mega Sharpedo's sweeping capabilities.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azumarill is capable of Perish trapping problematic Pokemon like Skarmory and Toxapex thanks to Whirlpool + Perish Song. Tectonic Rage Greninja is capable of taking out Alolan Muk, something Mega Sharpedo struggles with, and chips at Mega Venusaur with Extrasensory. Choice Scarf Greninja can KO Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latios and Tapu Bulu that revenge kill Mega Sharpedo and set up Spikes to threaten counters like Porygon2. Mega Sharpedo complements Greninja in return by allowing it to drop a potential Dark-type STAB move in favor of other coverage. Toxapex can reliably switch into Pokemon like Porygon2 and Skarmory that wall Mega Sharpedo and take advantage of their passive nature by setting up Toxic Spikes, allowing Mega Sharpedo to more easily clean. Mantine is a great teammate, as it can use Defog to remove annoying entry hazards like Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock, which hinder Mega Sharpedo's cleaning potential. Stealth Rock users like Swampert and Empoleon can help chip at Pokemon like Skarmory and Tapu Bulu so Mega Sharpedo can KO them. Gyarados is capable of taking out Mega Venusaur and Skarmory, allowing Mega Sharpedo to more easily sweep. Pivots like Rotom-W and Lanturn can bring Sharpedo in freely thanks to a slow Volt Switch, and the latter can heal any detrimental status that Sharpedo might have. Suicune can PP stall Mega Venusaur's Giga Drain so later on in the game Mega Sharpedo can sweep more freely. Choice Specs Keldeo can form a wallbreaking core with Mega Sharpedo, taking out problematic Pokemon like Porygon2 for Mega Sharpedo.</p> "

  "Torkoal": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fire</h1> <p>Torkoal is one of Fire's best utility Pokemon, compressing roles of entry hazard remover, hazard setter, status spreader, and weather setter due to its access to Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, Yawn, and Drought. Drought's harsh sunlight also allows many of Torkoal's teammates to act as powerful wallbreakers with Fire-type STAB attacks while minimizing damage taken from Water-type attacks. Torkoal's amazing Defense allows it to switch into many physical attacks such as Close Combat from Mega Gallade and Shadow Claw from Mimikyu; however, its low Special Defense prevents it from being effective against most special attackers. Its pure Fire typing leaves much to be desired defensively as well, being weak to common coverage types such as Ground, Rock, and Water. Torkoal's mediocre Special Attack stat and lack of coverage mean it has little to no offensive presence, especially against Pokemon that resist Fire. Its very low Speed leaves it outsped by nearly every commonly used Pokemon, including most defensive Pokemon. However, this can also be an advantage, as it allows Torkoal to set sun if it switches in at the same time as other common weather setters such as Pelipper, Alolan Ninetales, and Hippowdon. Its lack of recovery options prevents Torkoal from having any sort of sustainability, which puts pressure on it to stay alive in order to continuously remove hazards from the field while effectively performing its other roles at the same time. This makes it difficult for Torkoal to perform all of the roles it's compressing for the team. Torkoal is in competition with Rotom-H and Volcanion to act as a hazard remover; however, Torkoal's amazing role compression solidifies its spot on Fire.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be run over Yawn to help Torkoal whittle down opposing walls that are not threatened by Torkoal otherwise, such as Porygon2 and Mantine.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Torkoal's low Special Defense leaves it vulnerable to most special attackers such as Landorus, Tapu Koko, and Kyurem-B, which threaten to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Keldeo, Greninja, and Seismitoad are largely unaffected by Torkoal, as they resist its only attacking option and threaten it with super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye and Jellicent prevent Torkoal's main function by blocking Rapid Spin, leaving the team vulnerable to entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Common Dragon-types such as Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon resist Torkoal's only attack, leaving it only able to fish for burns with Lava Plume or utilize Yawn.</p> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran is immune to Torkoal's only coverage move and can shut it down with Taunt, preventing it from being able to set Stealth Rock or utilize Yawn, and then set its own Stealth Rock or threaten Torkoal with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Zapdos and Chansey are able to recover any damage that Torkoal dishes out while slowly whittling down Torkoal due to its lack of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Substitute and Taunt: Taunt prevents Torkoal from being able to utilize Yawn, allowing common stallbreakers such as Mew to block sleep status and whittle Torkoal down. Common Substitute users such as Zapdos and Gyarados also take advantage of blocking Yawn to whittle down Torkoal or set up and sweep.</p> ",

        "name": "Entry Hazard Remover",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rapid Spin is necessary on Torkoal, as it enables it to remove troublesome entry hazards such as Stealth Rock from the field. Stealth Rock further strengthens its function as a support Pokemon to help whittle down opposing Pokemon as they switch in. Lava Plume is Torkoal's primary offensive attack, which threatens physical attackers with a 30% burn chance. Yawn threatens opposing switch-ins and setup sweepers due to its function of putting a foe to sleep after two turns.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP and 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature help enable Torkoal to be as physically defensive as possible while minimizing the damage taken by Stealth Rock. Drought allows Torkoal to set harsh sunlight upon switching in, which boosts all Fire-type attacks and reduces all Water-type attacks' power by 50%. Heat Rock maximizes the number of turns that harsh sunlight remains on the field, prolonging the power boost for its teammates to utilize. Leftovers is an option over Heat Rock to give Torkoal some sustainability, allowing it to switch into entry hazards more frequently to remove them; however, you lose out on the additional harsh sunlight turns.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep Torkoal as healthy as possible while an opposing entry hazard setter is still healthy, as it will need to have the ability to remove hazards throughout the battle. In that same notion, switch Torkoal into hazard setters that do not threaten it such as Forretress and Jirachi in order to immediately remove hazards from the field. Keep Torkoal away from special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Latios, as they're able to do large damage to it, threatening to OHKO or 2HKO it. Switch in Torkoal against predicted passive Pokemon such as Toxapex in order to set Stealth Rock, utilize Rapid Spin, or threaten sleep with Yawn. Utilizing U-turn on Torkoal's teammates can be key to get Torkoal onto the field on predicted switches. Try to keep harsh sunlight up on the field as much as possible in order to maximize the damage output of Torkoal's teammates with their Fire-type attacks and to weaken Water-type attacks from foes. Prevent Torkoal from being poisoned, as it is easily whittled down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Utilize Yawn and Stealth Rock together by forcing your opponent to switch out their Pokemon continuously, forcing them to either take entry hazard damage or have one of their Pokemon fall asleep. Be wary of opposing Pokemon that may carry either Taunt or Substitute such as Gyarados, Zapdos, and Mew, as they will be able to prevent Torkoal from successfully utilizing Yawn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Torkoal is an amazing Pokemon for Fire-type teams due to its ability to compress roles between entry hazard remover and setter as well as a harsh sunlight setter. Heatran is a great teammate for Torkoal due to its neutrality to Rock-type attacks, which allows it to take on threatening Pokemon such as Nihilego. Torkoal running Stealth Rock also frees up Heatran to run additional coverage or utility moves such as Taunt. Victini greatly appreciates Torkoal's team support and is able to act as an even more powerful wallbreaker under harsh sunlight, allowing it to threaten Pokemon that can typically switch into a V-create from the Choice Scarf set such as Mega Latias after Stealth Rock or from the Choice Band set such as Swampert. Torkoal also acts as a great switch-in following Victini's U-turn to absorb physical attacks or threaten walls with Yawn. In the same vein as Victini, Infernape greatly appreciates Torkoal's support in boosting its Fire-type attacks, whittling down foes with Stealth Rock, and acting as a solid switch-in following U-turn. Mega Charizard X and Volcarona work in conjunction with Torkoal due to its ability to put foes to sleep with Yawn, which gives them ample opportunity to set up Dragon Dance and Quiver Dance. Volcanion provides a great Water immunity for Torkoal, being able to switch in to a plethora of Water-types. While harsh sunlight reduces the power of Volcanion's Steam Eruption, it boosts the power of its Fire Blast, which enables it to be a powerful special wallbreaker. With Drought support, Blacephalon also becomes a very powerful wallbreaker when using Fire-type attacks; it also appreciates the removal of hazards from the field due to its poor bulk. Mega Charizard Y provides a great Ground-type immunity for Torkoal and appreciates Stealth Rock being removed from the field. When combined, they form a great anti-rain and -sand core, being able to prevent opposing weather from staying on the field. This can be crucial against rain Water and sand Ground teams.</p> "

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Mega Altaria's Dragon / Fairy typing, good bulk, and access to Dragon Dance make it a deadly setup sweeper. Its typing gives a plethora of resistances, including Dark, Fighting, and Water along with a handy immunity to Dragon, making it instrumental in the Dragon matchup. Mega Altaria's solid bulk along with reliable recovery in Roost gives it the ability to repeatedly take powerful attacks from the likes of Latios and Keldeo. Access to utility moves such as Defog and Heal Bell lets Mega Altaria run a supportive set, as Dragon-type teams lack reliable entry hazard removers and are weak to hazards and status. It also has Pixilate to gain unique and powerful Fairy-type attacks, and Earthquake lets it get past some of its would-be checks and counters such as Nidoking and Alolan Muk.  However, Mega Altaria has a mediocre base 80 Speed stat, which means it is revenge killed by Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Gengar even with a Dragon Dance boost. It is also vulnerable to priority from the likes of Bullet Punch Scizor and Ice Shard Mamoswine, meaning it can be revenge killed if it takes unnecessary damage. Mega Altaria is extremely predictable, so Pokemon such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn can almost always wall it. Its average Attack stat causes it to rely on Dragon Dance boosts to deal significant damage. Altaria is weak to Stealth Rock before Mega Evolving, making it less sustainable. It also faces competition from Mega Latias as a Mega Evolution, because Dragon teams otherwise lack a bulky Defog user and have to rely on Choice Scarf Defog Latios to remove hazards, and from Salamence as a Dragon Dance user, as Salamence is faster and has the ability to wallbreak with Devastating Drake; however, Mega Altaria is considered a better option because of its Fairy-type STAB and better bulk.</p> ",

Earthquake can be used to get past Steel- and Poison-types that would otherwise wall Mega Altaria such as Heatran and Nidoking. Alternatively, Heal Bell can be used to allow Mega Altaria to rid it and its teammates of status aliments.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Altaria to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Mega Altaria to be as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Dragonite and Breloom naturally and surpassing threats such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu at +1. Natural Cure is the preferred ability over Cloud Nine, as it allows Altaria to cure status if it switches. Altarianite allows Altaria to become Mega Altaria and gain the ability Pixilate, which turns Mega Altaria's Normal-type Attacks into Fairy-type attacks while also giving them a slight boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is usually best to remove entry hazards because Mega Altaria tends to need full health to successfully set up multiple Dragon Dances. Avoid unnecessarily switching Mega Altaria into attacks because that makes it a lot harder for Mega Altaria to take super effective hits from Mamoswine and Keldeo. It is usually best to use Dragon Dance on a predicted switch so that Mega Altaria doesn't have to take unnecessary damage. Since this Mega Altaria set doesn't have any defensive investment, it is best to bring it in after a fainted teammate. If Mega Altaria is running Heal Bell, preserve its PP so that Mega Altaria doesn't get crippled by status. Only reveal Heal Bell if it is absolutely necessary so that Mega Altaria can force out Pokemon such as Heatran and Gengar with the threat of Earthquake. Before trying to sweep late-game, make sure Mega Altaria's checks and counters are weakened or KOed so it can successfully sweep. If Mega Altaria cannot be revenge killed, it should be used to wallbreak early-game because few Pokemon can switch into Mega Altaria at +1. Mega Altaria is important and easily sweeps in the Dragon matchup, so it should be preserved until its checks such as Dragalge and Choice Scarf Salamence are eliminated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Altaria is a great addition to any Dragon-type team due to its good bulk and immunity to Dragon-type attacks. Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock, making it much easier for Mega Altaria to sweep late-game, as well as check Swords Dance Mega Scizor with Fire Blast and eliminate Poison-types with its STAB Ground-type attacks. Latios can remove entry hazards with Defog and revenge kill threats that can revenge kill Mega Altaria such as Nidoking and Nihilego. Kyurem-B can eliminate some of Mega Altaria's checks and counters such as Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, and Toxapex with Ice Beam and Earth Power. Mega Altaria can easily take Fighting-type attacks for Kyurem-B in return. Dragonite can eliminate certain Steel-types that wall Mega Altaria such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Heatran with Fire Punch or Earthquake. Dragalge can set up Toxic Spikes, making it much easier for Mega Altaria to sweep late-game. Dragalge also can eliminate Fairy-types that give Mega Altaria trouble such as Azumarill and Tapu Koko. Hydreigon can take on bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Jellicent and Slowbro, while Mega Altaria can eliminate Mega Sableye to let Hydreigon sweep Ghost teams with ease. Choice Scarf Salamence can revenge kill threats such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko with Iron Tail and Earthquake. Dragon Dance Salamence with Devastating Drake can be run to form a powerful wallbreaking core with Mega Altaria.

Maximum HP investment and 16 EVs in Defense along with an Impish nature ensures that Mega Altaria is as bulky as possible. Natural Cure is chosen over Cloud Nine because it allows Altaria to remove status if it doesn't Mega Evolve. Altarianite allows Altaria to become Mega Altaria, changing its ability to Pixilate. Pixilate turns Mega Altaria's Normal-type Attacks into slightly boosted Fairy-type attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Mega Altaria has good natural bulk along with HP and Defense investment, it should be switched into neutral STAB attacks because it can easily take multiple of them and recover the damage with Roost. If Mega Altaria is running Refresh, it is a great idea to use Mega Altaria to take on bulky walls such as Chansey and Porygon2. Preserve Heal Bell's PP, as Mega Altaria is otherwise susceptible to poison, paralysis, and burn making it impossible to sweep late-game. It is usually best to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Tapu Bulu.

Hydreigon can eliminate Ghost- and Psychic-types that Mega Altaria cannot easily break such as Alolan Marowak and Jirachi. Mega Altaria can easily take Fighting-type attacks from Keldeo and Terrakion in return. Choice Scarf Salamence can revenge kill Mega Diancie with Iron Tail for Mega Altaria.

Heal Bell gives Mega Altaria the ability to remove status effects from your team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>176 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Mega Altaria outspeed Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Diggersby, Jolly Bisharp, and Jolly Breloom. 252 HP and 80 Defense EVs make Mega Altaria as bulky as possible, letting it take hits such as Choice Scarf Greninja's Gunk Shot more comfortably. Natural Cure lets Altaria cure its status effect when it switches out, which can allow it to be used as a status sponge before it Mega Evolves. Altarianite lets Altaria Mega Evolve and grants it Pixilate, which transforms Body Slam into an effective STAB move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to Mega Evolve Altaria early-game to take advantage of its Fairy typing, which can be used to keep Dark- and Dragon-types under control and allow it to pivot more often and more safely due to the Pixilate and Defense boost it gets. In matchups such as against Poison- and Steel-type teams where Mega Altaria has very little to offer, not Mega Evolving is a decent choice of action, as Altaria can use Defog and Heal Bell safer and can utilize Natural Cure to act as a status sponge against common status spreaders like Toxapex. Use Mega Altaria's good defensive typing and decent natural bulk to pivot into Choice-locked foes such as Victini and Latios, as well as weak attacks from Pokemon like Mantine and Toxapex. However, make sure to restore its HP with Roost before it switches out so it can switch in and use Defog more consistently during the game. Try to spread paralysis with Body Slam against faster threats and Choice Scarf users such as Greninja to help your team. Use Defog to keep hazards away from your side of field, as Mega Altaria's capability of removing Stealth Rock safely helps with bringing in wallbreakers like Kyurem-B and Dragonite more consistently. Be wary of setup sweepers like Swords Dance Mega Scizor, as Mega Altaria's lack of offensive presence is easily punished; switch out to teammates like Garchomp and Dragonite that can handle those setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Altaria's part Fairy typing paired up with utility options such as Defog and Heal Bell makes it a valuable pick for every Dragon-type team, as its Dragon immunity will help with a mirror matchup. Dragonite makes an excellent partner to Mega Altaria, as Dragonite can break through Steel- and Poison-types like Mega Scizor and Toxapex with its moves while Mega Altaria keeps Dragonite safe from Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, as well as help keep its Multiscale up by removing Stealth Rock with Defog. Garchomp makes another good partner for Mega Altaria, as it can pressure Steel- and Poison-types with Earthquake as well as checking Scizor with Fire Blast. Its access to Stealth Rock will also help you pressure the opposing team's hazard removal Pokemon and slowly break through them, Garchomp can force their entry hazard removal Pokemon out with Dragon Tail and cripple them with Toxic. Mega Altaria's Defog benefits Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latios, as it gives a free slot to Latios for Hidden Power Steel to help with Mega Diancie, which is a huge threat to Dragon-type teams. Kyurem-B is another partner that appreciates Defog support, as its typing makes it very vulnerable to entry hazards. In addition to that, the paralysis from Body Slam make up for Kyurem-B's mediocre Speed stat, letting it outspeed Pokemon like Choice Scarf Greninja, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Terrakion. In return, Kyurem-B can deal with Mega Venusaur, Celesteela, and Toxapex for Mega Altaria. Kommo-o makes a decent partner for Mega Altaria, as it can beat common Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon and Tyranitar as well as break through Steel-types with STAB-boosted Close Combat.

    "overview": "<h1>Grass</h1> <p>Cradily's Rock / Grass typing along with its excellent special bulk allows it to take powerful Fire- and Flying-type attacks from Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Togekiss. It is the most reliable Stealth Rock user on Grass teams because of its typing and bulk allowing it to set up Stealth Rock against Fire and Flying teams. In conjunction with its solid special bulk, Cradily has reliable recovery in Recover, giving it sustainability while also forming an excellent defensive core with Mega Venusaur. However, Cradily is susceptible to common Ice- and Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Mamoswine and Terrakion. Cradily is also extremely slow, even for a defensive Pokemon, leaving it vulnerable to stallbreakers such as Mew and Gliscor. It has mediocre Special Attack and Attack stats as well, which means certain setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Garchomp can set up on it with ease.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Cradily's fantastic defensive utility makes it a great asset to Rock teams as a mixed defensive wall. Its immunity to Water-type attacks thanks to Storm Drain allows it to switch into offensive Water-types that threaten Rock teams such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Swampert. It can also beat Belly Drum Azumarill under Sticky Web. Additionally, its part Grass typing gives it a neutrality to Ground- and Grass-type attacks, which allows it to switch into Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Access to Recover lets it remain healthy throughout a match, making it a reliable defensive wall. Unfortunately, Cradily is incredibly passive, leaving it unable to threaten setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Gallade or stallbreakers like Mew and Gliscor. This passiveness also makes it a momentum drain on more offensive Rock teams that rely on constant pressure from offensive threats like Terrakion and Mega Diancie.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is used to pressure Fire-, Flying-, Bug-, and Ice-types that threaten Grass teams such as Mega Charizard Y, Togekiss, Volcarona, and Kyurem-B. Recover enables Cradily to recover its HP, giving it sustainability. Rock Slide allows Cradily to hit Bug-, Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, Kyurem-B, and Mantine. Toxic is used to cripple walls such as Mandibuzz and Porygon2, which would otherwise wall Cradily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment along with a Careful nature ensures that Cradily is as bulky as possible and able to take +1 Inferno Overdrive from Volcarona. Leftovers allows Cradily to recover a bit of its HP each turn. Storm Drain is the preferred ability because it enables Cradily to be a solid Scald switch-in. Alternatively, Suction Cups can be used to ensure that Cradily cannot be phazed by Skarmory so that its teammates do not take unnecessary damage from entry hazards.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Set up Stealth Rock as early as possible to pressure Flying-, Ice-, Bug-, and Fire-types such as Zapdos, Kyurem-B, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y. Preserve Cradily's HP because it needs to maintain high HP to switch in and KO Mega Charizard Y. Be wary of status, specifically burn and poison, because a burn halves Cradily's already mediocre Attack stat, while poison slowly wears it down, decreasing its sustainability. Since Cradily's Defense is average, avoid switching into powerful physical attackers such as Terrakion and Garchomp. Cradily should be switched in on special attackers such as Togekiss and Tapu Koko so that it can cripple them with Toxic. Avoid Knock Off, as Cradily is easily worn down when without Leftovers recovery. Switch Cradily, which is immune to Water, into Scald so that its teammates don't have to take unnecessary damage and risk the possible burn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cradily fits on most Grass teams because of its ability to set up Stealth Rock. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn can take Ice- and Bug-type attacks for Cradily, while Cradily can eliminate Mega Charizard Y. Ferrothorn can set up Spikes for Cradily and is able to switch into Toxic. Mega Venusaur can switch into physical Fire-type attacks that Cradily doesn't take well. Tapu Bulu sets up Grassy Terrain for Cradily, giving it more sustainability, while Cradily can switch into Fire-type attacks for Tapu Bulu. Since Cradily can check Mega Charizard Y, Breloom is an excellent teammate because it is then free to run Life Orb over Focus Sash, making it a bigger offensive threat. Serperior appreciates Cradily's ability to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Porygon2 with Toxic, as that enables it to sweep late-game. Rotom-C can use Volt Switch to bring Cradily in safely. Celebi and Whimsicott can eliminate Fighting-types that KO Cradily and the latter is also immune to Dragon-type attacks.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain is Cradily's best STAB move, dealing significant damage against Water-types like Mega Sharpedo, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon and Ground-types like Hippowdon and Dugtrio while also healing Cradily. Recover is essential for keeping Cradily healthy throughout a match so it can consistently switch into Pokemon like Garchomp. Toxic is good for wearing down opposing walls like Mantine, Zapdos, and Porygon2. Mirror Coat gives Cradily a way to offensively pressure special attackers that it can survive a hit from, like Mega Charizard Y and Landorus under sand.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP is used to make Cradily as bulky as possible. 48 Speed EVs are used to always outspeed Belly Drum Azumarill, which is one of the biggest threats to Rock teams, after the Speed drop from Sticky Web. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense with a Bold nature to let Cradily avoid a 2HKO from Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech and Landorus-T's Earthquake. Leftovers is used to give Cradily passive recovery each turn, which greatly benefits its role as a defensive wall. Storm Drain is Cradily's best ability, granting it an immunity to Water-type attacks that threaten Rock teams. The Special Attack increase granted from Storm Drain also helps Cradily OHKO frail Water-types like Greninja and Mega Sharpedo.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's important to keep Cradily as healthy as possible in order to check offensive threats like Landorus-T and Mega Swampert. Against special attackers like Mega Charizard Y and Latios, it's usually best to use Mirror Coat immediately to try removing them. However, Toxic can also be used on an expected Roost or Defog. Toxic can also be used if a defensive wall such as Torkoal or Zapdos attempts to switch in. Keep Cradily away from poison, since it can wear it down very quickly throughout a match. Make sure to consistently bring in Cradily on predicted Water-type attacks to protect teammates like Tyranitar and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie can check Fighting-types like Keldeo and Heracross that threaten Cradily as well as bounce back Toxic Spikes thanks to Magic Bounce. Shuckle can set up Sticky Web for Cradily, allowing it to outspeed Belly Drum Azumarill. It can also use Knock Off to remove Leftovers from bulky Pokemon like Mantine and Zapdos to make them easier to wear down. Terrakion is able to beat Steel-types like Heatran, Excadrill, and Stakataka that Cradily can't threaten. In return, Cradily can switch into and beat bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Tyranitar can break past defensive Pokemon that aren't affected by Toxic, such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, and provides Cradily some important special bulk with Sand Stream. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem are both able to beat Mega Scizor for Cradily. Rhyperior can serve as a blanket check against physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Excadrill, while Alolan Golem can trap and remove defensive Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela.</p> "

  "Armaldo": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Armaldo is the best entry hazard remover for Bug-type teams because of Rapid Spin and its ability to threaten common opposing hazard removers such as Crobat, Mantine, and Zapdos. Armaldo can also set up Stealth Rock for the team, along with being able to take on Flying-type Pokemon thanks to STAB Stone Edge. Armaldo is comparable to Forretress as a reliable hazard remover for Bug-type teams, but it is not weak to Fire-type attacks and isn't as passive. Its Rock typing notably allows it to take a V-create from Victini and hit it back with either Knock Off or Stone Edge. However, Armaldo is weak to Stealth Rock due to its Bug typing, it cannot remove hazards against Ghost-type Pokemon, and is weak to common offensive coverage such as Rock-type and Water-type attacks, forcing Armaldo to switch out often. In addition, Armaldo is not the strongest Pokemon and can be set up on very easily, by the likes of Swords Dance Mega Scizor and Calm Mind Mega Latias. Furthermore, since Armaldo has poor bulk and only base 75 HP, it is difficult for it to take on Pokemon that threaten most Bug-type Pokemon and still fulfill its role as a hazard remover for the team.</p> ",

Pokemon like Keldeo and Mega Swampert resist Armaldo's attacks and beat Armaldo with their Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Magic Bounce prevents Armaldo from setting up Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field. Mega Sableye not only is a spinblocker but also prevents Armaldo from putting Stealth Rock on its side of the field. Mega Sableye can also remove Armaldo's Leftovers with Knock Off and burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Diancie punishes Armaldo if it tries to set Stealth Rock on the field and beats Armaldo with its Rock-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: There are many Pokemon that take advantage of Armaldo and set up on it without being pressured. Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill set up on Armaldo and threaten the rest of its team.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Armaldo loses 25% every time it switches in on Stealth Rock, limiting the number of times it can switch in on entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon resist both of Armaldo's STAB attacks and can hit it super effectively with their own STAB attacks.

        "name": "Defensive Spinner (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is used to cripple incoming Pokemon on any type and help put foes into range for Bug's powerful offensive backbone to come in and sweep. Rapid Spin is crucial for Armaldo because most of its partners are weak to Stealth Rock. It is Armaldo's job to keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field, but it struggles against Ghost-type Pokemon. Armaldo compresses these two roles into one set very nicely, as it also has Knock Off as a utility move for removing items like Eviolite from Chansey and Porygon2 and even Choice Scarf from Victini. Stone Edge is Armaldo's Rock-type STAB attack, allowing it to threaten Flying-type Pokemon better, such as Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y. Armaldo can also use it to threaten Bug-type Pokemon like Mega Pinsir and Volcarona that can otherwise set up and sweep.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An investment of 252 HP EVs allows Armaldo to minimize the damage taken from Stealth Rock and increases Armaldo's longevity. The Defense investment allows it to take a V-create from Victini, even after Stealth Rock damage, enabling it to remove said Stealth Rock or Knock Off a Choice Scarf. The rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense with a Careful nature to help Armaldo survive Fire-type special wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y's attacks. Leftovers is a good item for Armaldo because it increases Armaldo’s longevity. Battle Armor is Armaldo's best ability to block critical hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Armaldo's role on the team is to keep entry hazards off the field with Rapid Spin and to support its teammates. Also, Armaldo can set up Stealth Rock to weaken opposing Pokemon to help the team. Stealth Rock is important for weakening Pokemon so Bug-type teams' offensive sweepers can come in and pick off the weakened Pokemon. Set up the hazard early on in matches and if Armaldo doesn't need to clear hazards with Rapid Spin right away. Knock Off allows Armaldo to help its teammates knock out Eviolite Pokemon like Chansey and Porygon2 more easily. Also, Knock Off allows Armaldo to hit the Ghost-type Pokemon that spinblock it, such as Gengar. Armaldo's STAB Stone Edge is used to weaken Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Crobat that threaten Armaldo's partners. Armaldo can also act as a check to Victini if Armaldo has not been damaged much, but after one switch into Stealth Rock Armaldo can no longer check it. In some matchups, know when it's more important to set up Stealth Rock for clutch chip damage or to clear hazards to secure a sweep from teammates. For example, Stealth Rock is important against Normal-type teams because hazards pressure the team and allows Armaldo's partners a chance to break through. Also, since Armaldo only has base 75 Special Defense, it should not be staying in on strong special attackers if it doesn't have to. Meanwhile Rapid Spin can become crucial against Rock-type teams because Bug-type teams cannot afford to have Stick Web and Stealth Rock on their side of the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Galvantula uses Sticky Web to slow down Pokemon and support the rest of the team, just like Armaldo. Together, they pressure Flying-type teams, and Armaldo can remove entry hazards while keeping Galvantula's Sticky Web up. Galvantula also pressures Dark-types, Psychic-types, and Water-types with its coverage, which is very helpful for Armaldo. Also, Scizor is a great partner for Armaldo because it resists Steel-type attacks that Armaldo cannot handle and is neutral against Rock-type attacks. In return, Armaldo is neutral against Scizor's Fire-type weakness and can beat Fire-types with Stone Edge. When using the alternative spread for Armaldo, Scizor can remove Victini with Choice Band-boosted Pursuit after Victini uses V-create twice on Armaldo. Armaldo supports Volcarona well because Volcarona is 4x weak to Stealth Rock. With hazards off the field and Volcarona healthy, it becomes a lot easier for it to set up Quiver Dance. Mega Pinsir also appreciates Armaldo because it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and needs Armaldo to clear hazards. If Stealth Rock isn't up, Mega Pinsir can set up a Swords Dance a lot more easily. Also, Armaldo can remove Eviolites from Pokemon like Chansey and Porygon2 allowing Mega Pinsir to break them down easier. Heracross helps Armaldo because Heracross has the ability Guts, boosting its Attack stat if statused. This allows Heracross to break through Mega Sableye, which counters Armaldo. Araquanid is a very solid partner for Armaldo because of its immunity to burn thanks to its ability Water Bubble and its resistance to Water-type attacks. Armaldo supports Araquanid by taking Flying-type attacks for it and keeping hazards off the field. Araquanid replaces Armaldo as the Fire-type check, alleviating some pressure from Armaldo. Yanmega is another very strong special attacker that benefits from Armaldo's hazard removal. Yanmega also pressures Dark-types and Psychic-types and benefits from Armaldo setting up Stealth Rock, allowing it to KO weakened Pokemon.</p> "

Walrein's Special Attack stat also is mediocre on its own, forcing it to rely on Choice Specs to do respectable damage.

Blizzard is a more powerful Ice-type STAB move that has perfect accuracy in hail and can always 2HKO Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack with a Modest nature and Choice Specs is used to maximize Walrein's offensive presence, allowing it to 2HKO Mantine after Stealth Rock with Blizzard. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Mega Venusaur and bulky Mega Scizor.

Thick Fat grants Walrein a resistance to Fire-type attacks such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Torkoal's Lava Plume.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to Walrein’s great bulk, it's a good idea to switch it into resisted hits from Pokemon like Heatran and Blacephalon. In the Bug and Steel matchups, make sure to preserve Walrein's health, since it'll need to be as healthy as possible to check Mega Scizor. Try predicting when Mega Scizor tries to switch to a teammate that can take a Hidden Power Fire, such as Heatran or Armaldo, and use Surf to OHKO it on the switch. In matchups where it isn't necessary to keep Walrein healthy, it can be used more liberally to wallbreak early-game. Make sure to keep entry hazards like Stealth Rock off the field before sending in Walrein, since it gets worn down very quickly. In the Fire matchup, it's best to switch in Walrein against Fire-type attacks outside of sun, since Choice Scarf Blacephalon's sun-boosted Fire Blast can 2HKO Walrein after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil for Walrein, allowing it to switch into more powerful attacks like Choice Specs Blacephalon's sun-boosted Fire Blast. It can also check Fighting-types like Keldeo and Kommo-o that threaten to OHKO Walrein. Kyurem-B can break past defensive Pokemon like Celesteela and Mega Venusaur for Walrein, and it can switch into Electric-type attacks from Tapu Koko and Zapdos. Mamoswine and Piloswine are both able to set Stealth Rock for Walrein, allowing it to 2HKO Mantine with Blizzard. Mamoswine can beat wallbreakers like Breloom, Landorus, and Dragonite with Ice Shard, while Piloswine can consistently switch into special attackers like Tapu Koko and Nihilego. Additionally, they can both check Electric-types for Walrein. Alolan Sandslash can check Rock-types like Mega Diancie, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nihilego under hail and can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to keep Walrein healthy. In return, Walrein switches into Fire-type attacks from fast threats like Blacephalon and Infernape. Weavile can revenge kill threats that outspeed Walrein like Dragonite and Landorus, and it can remove Porygon2's Eviolite with Knock Off so Walrein can 2HKO it with Surf. It can also Pursuit trap Pokemon on Psychic teams that threaten Walrein, such as Latios and Choice Band Victini. Avalugg and Rotom-F are able to remove entry hazards for Walrein. Avalugg can switch into Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Infernape and Choice Scarf Terrakion, while Rotom-F can cripple Mega Scizor with Will-O-Wisp so that Walrein can check it more effectively and can use Volt Switch to bring Walrein in safely. Cloyster appreciates Walrein's ability to check Mega Scizor so it can more easily set up with Shell Smash and sweep types like Bug and Steel.</p> "

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Salamence has access to Dragon Dance, which, combined with its decent Attack and Speed and its ability Moxie, makes it a very good late-game cleaner for Dragon teams. With a Dragon Dance boost and Devastating Drake, Salamence is able to run through some of its checks, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, Mega Sableye, and Mega Venusaur. Salamence can also be a decent Choice Scarf user for Dragon teams to cover the role of revenge killer and late-game cleaner with the support of Moxie. However, Salamence's Flying typing makes it weak to Stealth Rock, which limits its opportunities to switch in and makes it harder to set up, making entry hazard control provided by Defog Latios or Defog Latias necessary. Another problem that Salamence faces is the wide presence of Choice Scarf users with base 100 Speed or more and access to moves that hit Salamence effectively, such as Greninja and Terrakion, which hinders Salamence's job because it can be easily revenge killed by them even at +1 Speed. In addition, its Dragon / Flying typing means it carries a 4x weakness to the common Ice-type attacks, which makes revenge killing much easier for the opponent and leaves Salamence vulnerable to Ice Shard from Ice-types like Mamoswine and Weavile. Despite its access to coverage moves like Fire Fang and Earthquake to hit Steel-types super effectively, Salamence is still neutralized by common walls such as Skarmory if they are healthy enough. It is important to note that Salamence is generally outclassed by Latios as a Choice Scarf user, since even +1 Salamence is outsped by threats like Choice Scarf Terrakion and Mega Swampert in rain.

However, the coverage it offers is not very useful, and the power of Devastating Drake is needed to maximize Salamence's chances of KOing walls like Mega Sableye and Toxapex. Dragon Claw is an option to consider for the Choice Scarf set over Outrage if you are concerned about locking Salamence into Outrage, but it makes Salamence so much weaker.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Tapu Fini and Clefable can take a hit from every set even at +1, and they threaten Salamence with their STAB moves.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance allows Salamence to boost its Attack and Speed, helping it to become a powerful sweeper. Outrage is Salamence's STAB Dragon-type attack and its most powerful move with 120 Base Power. However, this move has the disadvantage of locking Salamence into it for two to three turns and preventing it from switching out, so the opponent can take advantage of a badly timed Outrage. Devastating Drake is a 190-Base Power move resulting from Dragonium Z that deals massive amounts of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, such as Mandibuzz, Mega Venusaur, Porygon2, and Mega Sableye. Earthquake is coverage that hits Steel-, Electric- and Poison-types such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Toxapex super effectively. Fire Fang hits Steel-types that Earthquake doesn't hit super effectively such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Salamence to hit as hard as possible and be as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, Mimikyu, and Porygon-Z. Moxie boosts Salamence's Attack by one stage every time it knocks out a foe, which helps it clean late-game. Dragonium Z turns Outrage into a 190-Base Power STAB Dragon-type move that increases the probability of Salamence running through some of its checks, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Salamence late-game, once its checks have been weakened or KOed and potential revenge killers have fainted, to ensure it is able to clean the opposing team, acting as a snowball sweeper thanks to Moxie. It can occasionally be used mid-game if it is needed to break some foes so its teammates can take advantage of the weakened opposition. Set up on Pokemon that Salamence checks, such as Victini and Mega Charizard Y, and Choice item users locked into moves Salamence resists, such as Excadrill locked into Earthquake. Be careful to avoid locking Salamence into Outrage when there are still Steel- and Fairy-types around, that can easily revenge kill it, such as Excadrill, Azumarill, and Mega Gardevoir. Furthermore, avoid switching Salamence into powerful hits to prevent it from taking unnecessary damage, as it needs to be as healthy as possible to set up. It is important to remove Stealth Rock before sending Salamence in, as it needs as much health as possible to ensure it can set up. Finally, avoid letting Salamence get hit by status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki, since burn makes Salamence almost useless and paralysis makes revenge killers such as Terrakion and Nihilego even more threatening.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp has access to Stealth Rock, which helps wear opposing teams down and allows Salamence to sweep more easily, and it resists Rock-type moves aimed at Salamence. Garchomp can also threaten Steel-types with Earthquake and Fire Blast, KOing or at least weakening them and easing Salamence's job. Choice Band Dragonite can act as a wallbreaker, weakening or KOing the checks it shares with Salamence, such as Skarmory and Porygon2. Once Dragonite has muscled past these walls, Salamence has an easier path to a sweep. Latios and Latias are the best bet for Dragon teams in terms of entry hazard control support, as both are able to remove Stealth Rock with Defog to preserve Salamence's health. In addition to that, Choice Scarf Latios outspeeds threatening revenge killers for Salamence such as Nihilego and Terrakion and is able to OHKO them with Psychic, while Latias has access to Healing Wish to restore Salamence's health and give it another opportunity to sweep. Latios and Latias also have access to STAB Psychic-type attacks that threaten Toxapex, which can be a problem for Salamence due to its combination of Recover and Haze, while Salamence threatens Alolan Muk, which can tank every hit from Latios and Latias and trap them with Pursuit. Kyurem-B can cover the role of mixed wallbreaker punching holes in the opposing team so Salamence can sweep after Kyurem-B has broken through walls. Kyurem-B can destroy some of the common checks to Salamence, such as Skarmory and Celesteela with Fusion Bolt and Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Furthermore, Kyurem-B can hit Steel-types with Earth Power and switch into Ice-type attacks for Salamence due to its Ice typing. Dragalge is neutral to Fairy thanks to its Poison typing and can threaten opposing Fairy-types with its Adaptability-boosted Sludge Wave. Dragalge can also set up Toxic Spikes to wear down opposing walls such as Porygon2 and Mega Slowbro, making it much easier for Salamence to sweep. In return, Salamence is immune to Ground-type moves. Hydreigon can get rid of more physically defensive walls such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro, while Salamence can remove more specially defensive walls, such as Chansey and Zapdos.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage is the most powerful physical STAB Dragon-type move that Salamence has access to, with 120 Base Power, and combined with some Moxie boosts, Outrage's power makes Salamence an effective late-game cleaner. Iron Tail is coverage to hit Fairy-types, especially Mega Diancie, which is a massive threat for Dragon teams. Earthquake lets Salamence hit Steel-, Electric-, and Poison-types, such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Toxapex. Fire Blast is used to hit Steel-types that Earthquake doesn't hit super effectively such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs are used to maximize Salamence's power as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, and 252 Speed EVs along with a Naive nature and Choice Scarf make Salamence as fast as possible. Moxie raises Salamence's Attack once for each foe that it KOes, turning Salamence into a good late-game cleaner.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Salamence should be brought in when there's a free turn, after a teammate has fainted, or when a Choice-locked opposing foe is locked into a move that Salamence resists or is immune to such as Earthquake from Landorus-T or Horn Leech from Tapu Bulu. After Salamence is brought in, it should revenge kill weakened threats such as Hydreigon and Tapu Koko. Salamence can also act as a cleaner if it manages to get some Moxie boosts, so it should be brought in late-game when the opposing team has been weakened enough and revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Greninja and Choice Scarf Terrakion are gone. Most of the time, Salamence will need Stealth Rock removed to maximize the number of times it can come in to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon, so Defog support is needed. Prevent Salamence from taking unnecessary damage; otherwise, it won't have enough health to switch in and revenge kill opposing threats. It is very important for Salamence to avoid status, especially burns or paralysis, since it won't be able to clean the opposing team or act as a revenge killer due to the Attack or Speed drop. Therefore, Salamence shouldn't stay in front of an incoming Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye or Rotom-W, Thunder Wave from Klefki or Slowbro, or move that has a chance to burn, such as Scald from Toxapex or Lava Plume from Torkoal. Finally, you should think twice before going for Outrage, as Salamence will be locked into it for two to three turns, making it easier for Steel- and Fairy-types such as Excadrill, Mega Gardevoir, Mimikyu, and Azumarill to revenge kill Salamence.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios and Latias can provide Defog support to get rid of Stealth Rock so as to preserve Salamence's health and maximize the number of times it can switch in. Choice Scarf Latios is able to outspeed massive threats to Salamence such as Terrakion and Nihilego while also threatening them with its STAB Psychic-type move, and Latias has access to Healing Wish to give Salamence a second opportunity to sweep. In return, Salamence can revenge kill a weakened Alolan Muk, which is one of the most prominent checks to Latios and Latias. Garchomp can set Stealth Rock to wear down opposing teams, making it easier for Salamence to clean, while also resisting Rock-type moves such as Rock Slide from Excadrill. Garchomp has access to the combination of Earthquake and Fire Blast, which can weaken Steel-types for Salamence even with no Attack and Special Attack investment. Kyurem-B is an extremely powerful mixed wallbreaker with good coverage, and it can punch holes in the opposing team to achieve a situation where Salamence can clean. Fusion Bolt lets Kyurem-B hit common checks to Salamence such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro, Earth Power threatens Steel-types that can be annoying for Salamence such as Heatran, and Ice Beam OHKOes Landorus-T. Choice Band Dragonite can break through many opposing threats and weaken the checks it shares with Salamence, such as Skarmory with Fire Punch and Porygon2 with Superpower. Hydreigon is able to get rid of physically defensive checks for Salamence such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro with Fire Blast and Dark Pulse, while Salamence can cripple Pokemon that wall Hydreigon such as Alolan Muk and Zapdos. Dragalge's Poison typing makes it neutral to Fairy, and it can hit opposing Fairy-types hard with its Adaptability-boosted Sluge Wave. Dragalge can also provide Salamence with an easier path to revenge killing and cleaning thanks to its capacity to set up Toxic Spikes, which can wear down foes that Salamence can't OHKO such as Tapu Fini. Mega Altaria is a powerful Dragon Dance user for Dragon teams that takes advantage of Salamence revenge killing Steel- and Fairy-types such as Excadrill and Mega Diancie, and in exchange Mega Altaria provides an immunity to Dragon-type moves aimed at Salamence such as Draco Meteor from Latios.</p> "

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Metagross is a very potent wallbreaker for Psychic that importantly makes waves in the otherwise troublesome Fairy matchup thanks to its priority STAB Bullet Punch and overwhelmingly strong Meteor Mash. Its high base Attack, strong STAB attacks, and varied coverage moves including Thunder Punch and Ice Punch allow Metagross to be customized to overcome specific matchups that the team may struggle with. Bullet Punch is immensely helpful in taking down opposing priority users like Azumarill as well as speedy Pokemon that Psychic struggles with like Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko, and it also enables Metagross to be a potent late-game cleaner once its defensive checks have been weakened or eliminated. Metagross is Psychic's only viable Pursuit user, giving it a specific niche in being able to trap and remove threatening foes to its team such as Latios. Psychic also greatly appreciates Metagross's Steel typing and high Defense, as it can reliably set up Stealth Rock and switch into incoming Ice-, Grass-, Dragon-, and Rock-type attacks that Psychic otherwise lacks effective switch-ins to, outside of Jirachi. While its Steel typing provides these benefits, it also comes with the downside of being weak to Ground and Fire; however, those can be made up for by teammates such as Latios, Latias, Celebi, and Slowbro. Metagross's Speed is unfortunately rather lacking as well; while it can outspeed most defensively-oriented Pokemon, it is still slower than most other offensive Pokemon, leaving it threatened by a large number of attackers such as Diggersby, Landorus, and importantly Mimikyu, which carries a +2 Shadow Sneak that can KO Metagross with minor chip damage. Utilizing Choice Band Metagross often requires forgoing using Choice Band Victini, which is an amazing physical wallbreaker that has few effective switch-ins.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Earthquake is a niche coverage move that enables Metagross to more reliably take on Toxapex and Steel-types that otherwise resist or take little damage from Metagross's commonly used moves. Hammer Arm is another coverage option that could be used to enable Metagross to take on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Air Balloon Heatran. Zen Headbutt could be used over Earthquake to ease up the Poison matchup, enabling Metagross to do severe damage to both Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, preventing the need to predict accurately between this defensive duo. However, this does open up the ability for Alolan Muk to come in and Pursuit trap Metagross.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Offensive Pokemon that carry Fire-, Ground-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks such as Victini, Excadrill, Bisharp, and Gengar all take advantage of Metagross's low Speed and threaten to freely KO it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Although Metagross utilizes Thunder Punch, it is taken advantage of by physically defensive Water-types such as Mega Slowbro. Most notably, Metagross cannot do much to Water- / Ground-types that resist its STAB attacks and are immune to Electric such as Swampert and Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Defensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory are able to take on Metagross while taking little or no damage from Earthquake. Air Balloon Heatran is also a huge threat to Metagross, as it's able to force Metagross out as long as its item is preserved. Ferrothorn and Heatran to need to be wary of Hammer Arm, however.</p> <p><strong>Protect: As a Choice Band user, Metagross is reliant on accurate predictions to deal with the opposing Pokemon. Pokemon that use Protect and Protect-like moves such as Mega Sableye and Toxapex are able to freely scout what move Metagross is using and switch into a teammate that can deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Burn: As a physical wallbreaker, Metagross is neutered by burns halving its Attack, effectively preventing it from having an offensive presence.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch makes up for Metagross's lackluster Speed stat and turns it into a potent revenge killer, notably being able to outspeed Azumarill's Aqua Jet. Meteor Mash is Metagross's strongest STAB attack, hitting for very heavy damage with a chance to boost its Attack and most notably dealing huge damage to Klefki, which shrugs off Bullet Punch. Thunder Punch prevents bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Slowbro from completely walling Metagross while also damaging troublesome Pokemon like Celesteela, which walls Metagross's other moves. Pursuit is a very potent move, especially in the Psychic mirror, letting Metagross trap and remove Pokemon it can freely switch into such as Choice Scarf Latios. Alternatively, Ice Punch grants Metagross BoltBeam coverage, providing immense utility in the Flying matchup to eliminate Landorus-T and Gliscor and more reliably take on Zapdos.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature and a Choice Band ensure Metagross is as strong as possible, allowing it to function as a potent wallbreaker and strong priority attacker. 172 Speed EVs allow Metagross to most importantly outspeed Jolly Azumarill, which allows its Bullet Punch to outspeed Azumarill's Aqua Jet. Clear Body blocks Intimidate from foes like Landorus-T as well as Sticky Web, which can prove to be very beneficial.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Metagross's importance in the Fairy matchup, be sure to preserve its HP as much as possible in order to consistently threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and Mega Diancie. If the opponent is utilizing Mimikyu, be sure to stay out of +2 Shadow Sneak KO range, as Metagross is one of the primary means of stopping Mimikyu from sweeping. Additionally, be careful in choosing when to use Bullet Punch or Meteor Mash. Utilizing Bullet Punch when not necessary can allow a defensive Pokemon like Klefki to freely come into play and freely set up entry hazards or dual screens. Look for opportunities to bring Metagross in safely throughout the battle in order to wallbreak. This can vary from utilizing a slow U-turn from Pokemon like Celebi to bring it in against resisted attacks from Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. In addition, when using Pursuit, look for opportunities to trap and remove threatening foes to the team. This can include switching in against Pokemon that do not threaten Metagross such as Choice Scarf Latios, following a fainted teammate, or bringing it in against weakened offensive threats that attempt to switch out to prevent being knocked out by Bullet Punch. When using Ice Punch, Metagross is able to make waves in the Flying matchup due to its potent BoltBeam coverage; be sure to conceal Metagross's Ice Punch to freely grab a KO against Landorus and Gliscor that attempt to switch into a predicted Thunder Punch. In matchups where preserving Metagross isn't a key win condition such as Normal and Dragon, utilize Metagross's high defenses to take on attackers lacking super effective coverage to punch holes through their team. Avoid burns from the likes of Will-O-Wisp Mega Sableye and Scald users like Toxapex at all cost, as they prevent Metagross from having any offensive presence.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gallade is one of the best teammates for Metagross, as it is able to take on Steel- and Dark-types with ease while helping immensely in the Poison matchup, where Metagross needs accurate predictions to be of any benefit. In turn, Metagross is able to switch into weak Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Clefable that threaten out Mega Gallade. Latios and Latias are both great ways of keeping faster foes in check, allowing Metagross to be saved to breaking past walls. Latias notably is able to provide Healing Wish support, while Latios is a great special attacker with ample coverage moves like Ice Beam and Thunderbolt to fill in holes of Pokemon that Metagross cannot handle depending on its chosen moveset. Victini is another Choice Scarf option to pair with Metagross that is very effective in matchups such as Electric where Metagross struggles to keep up. Celebi pairs effectively with Metagross due to its resistance to Ground-type attacks, allowing it to switch in with ease. It also benefits Metagross by utilizing a Steel killer set and can very effectively deal with Steel-types that Metagross cannot do much against. Furthermore, thanks to Natural Cure, it can switch into predicted Will-O-Wisps from Pokemon like Rotom-W that would otherwise cripple Metagross. Mega Latias and Mega Slowbro are effective specially-oriented setup sweepers that greatly appreciate Metagross eliminating special walls that they cannot break past such as Chansey and can take on Pokemon Metagross struggles with like Toxapex. Mew is a fantastic stallbreaker that can help ease the struggle Metagross has with some bulky types like Water and Flying as well as defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, easing the predictions necessary for Metagross to be effective in those matchups. Slowbro is a great defensive partner for Metagross, as it can reliably switch into oncoming Fire-type and physical attacks that threaten Metagross from the likes of Infernape and Victini. Alakazam works as a blanket check for nearly all physically offensive Pokemon thanks to Magic Guard, Focus Sash, and Counter, which enables it to take on sweepers that severely threaten Metagross such as Mega Sharpedo. Jirachi is another good partner for Metagross, as it both acts as a means of setting Stealth Rock to chip down foes and can pivot out to Metagross to bring it into the field safely.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Metagross can set up Stealth Rock by utilizing its good physical bulk. Meteor Mash is Metagross's strongest Steel-type STAB attack, allowing it to deal huge amounts of damage to foes that don't resist it. Bullet Punch makes up for Metagross's low Speed and occasionally lets it revenge kill Pokemon such as Mimikyu and Mega Diancie. Pursuit allows Metagross to trap Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Latios and Choice Band Victini. Zen Headbutt is used to handle Poison-type Pokemon that Meteor Mash can't hit effectively, such as Toxapex. Thunder Punch deals heavy damage to bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Mantine and Suicune.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>172 EVs in Speed ensure that Metagross outspeeds Jolly Azumarill and Choice Band Victini, the latter after it has used V-create. 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature ensure that Metagross hits as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to increase its bulk. Kasib Berry allows Metagross to safely break Mimikyu's Disguise. Colbur Berry is an option that allows Metagross to check fast Dark-type Pokemon such as Greninja and Hydreigon, which are troublesome for Psychic-type teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Metagross has to preserve its HP in order to safely check the threats it is supposed to check, such as Greninja and Mimikyu, so avoid letting it take unnecessary damage. Prevent Metagross from getting burned by Scald and Will-O-Wisp users such as Toxapex and Rotom-W; try to switch in teammates like Slowbro and Celebi instead. Metagross should also avoid paralysis from Klefki and excessive chip damage in Fairy-type matchups, as this will prevent it from checking Azumarill effectively. Be wary that damage-reducing Berries only have one use, so try to not waste them at the wrong time in order to preserve Metagross's ability to check problematic Pokemon. Avoid switching directly into attacks to prevent this from happening and instead, try to pivot with teammates like Celebi. Try to lead with Metagross in matchups where the Berry it's holding is not useful and take advantage of Metagross's good bulk and typing to set Stealth Rock as soon as possible. Use Bullet Punch to pick off opposing Pokemon if they're in the KO range. Take advantage of Choice-locked Pokemon such as Latios and Victini and Pursuit trap them. Try to use Bullet Punch in order to break Mimikyu's Disguise or revenge kill Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Meloetta's part-Normal typing lets it switch into Ghost-type attacks for Metagross, freeing it from running Kasib Berry to check Mimikyu. In return, Metagross threatens Fairy-type teams with Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Meloetta's Normal typing also lets it excel in a mirror matchup with its Shadow Ball and Hyper Voice, while Metagross can Pursuit trap opposing Meloetta and Choice Scarf Latios. Mega Gallade is an excellent partner, as it can pressure Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon for Metagross. In return, Metagross can switch into Flying- and Fairy-type attacks for Mega Gallade. Victini takes out Water- and Steel-type Pokemon for Metagross and frees it from needing to run Thunder Punch with its access to Bolt Strike. Victini can also bring Metagross into the field safely with U-turn. Alakazam makes a good partner for Metagross, as it can use Counter to take on fast Dark-type Pokemon that pose a huge threat to Psychic-type teams, such as Mega Sharpedo. Latios's excellent coverage moves, allow it to form a good offensive core with Metagross. Its STAB moves deal heavy damage to targets such as Swampert, Zapdos, and Rotom-W, and it can run Thunderbolt, to free Metagross from needing to run Thunder Punch and hit Flying- and Water-type Pokemon such as Mantine and Celesteela. Additionally, Latios can switch into Ground- and Fire-type attacks for Metagross. In return, Metagross can switch into Fairy- and Ice-type attacks that are targeting Latios. Choice Scarf Latias provides Healing Wish support for Metagross, and it can still switch into the same Pokemon as Latios. Celebi can switch into and beat Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Suicune for Metagross and can use Earth Power to effectively punish Steel-type Pokemon that Metagross cannot touch, such as Heatran. Slowbro forms a good defensive core with Metagross, as it is a good check to Fire-types and can use Thunder Wave to cover for Metagross's low Speed by crippling such as Greninja. Mega Slowbro is a potent setup sweeper that greatly benefits from Metagross, as Metagross can eliminate specific threats that Mega Slowbro struggles against, namely Chansey, Mantine, and Toxapex.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Using Calm Mind, Recover, and Stored Power, Mega Latias can serve as an effective defensive sweeper for Dragon that tears through otherwise troublesome matchups such as Normal. With two extra resistances to Psychic and Fighting, Latias's Dragon / Psychic typing allows it to resist many types. This can allow it set up on Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Chansey, and Mew. Furthermore, a useful Ground immunity allows Mega Latias to come in on Ground-type moves as well as avoid damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes and the Speed drop from Sticky Web. However, Mega Latias is useless in the Dark matchup if its only attacking move is Stored Power, and while it can run Thunderbolt to not be walled by Dark-types, it then loses the ability to take on walls that run a status-inducing move. Furthermore, Mega Latias struggles to set up against teams with wallbreakers such as Diggersby, Mamoswine, and Bisharp, as they are able to switch in on a Calm Mind and threaten it out with a heavy attack. Mega Altaria gives Mega Latias competition as a Mega Evolution, as it is a Dragon Dance user with more immediate power thanks to Pixilate and a typing that aids in matchups like Dark, which Mega Latias cannot excel in. Mega Latias does, however, always win against Ditto, unlike Mega Altaria, which has to bank on the Ditto not running the appropriate happiness to maximize the power of Return or Frustration. It also helps take on Double Dance Mew due to Calm Mind and its resistance to Psychic, which is something Mega Altaria cannot do. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Latias can deal with fast Fighting-type Pokemon like Terrakion and Keldeo, Poison-types like Nihilego, and setup sweepers like Cloyster and it is used over Latios because of its access to the utility move Healing Wish. With Defog, it can also get entry hazards out of the way for its Stealth Rock-weak teammates like Kyurem-B and Dragonite. However, even with its high Speed with Choice Scarf, it still gets outpaced by Choice Scarf Greninja, a big threat to Dragon teams. Furthermore, outside of Healing Wish, Latias is outclassed by Latios as a Choice Scarf user due to it hitting harder and securing KOs that Latias cannot without Stealth Rock like against Heracross and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>High Speed and solid Special Attack, alongside an excellent movepool that includes the likes of Stored Power, Draco Meteor, and Calm Mind, make Latias a dangerous offensive threat. Its solid secondary Dragon typing grants key resistances to Water-, Fire-, and Electric-type attacks, which allows it to take on the likes of Heatran and Mega Swampert. Latias's access to Levitate also grants it a useful immunity to Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake, increasing Latias's setup chances and adding to its defensive utility in checking threats such as Landorus. With access to Calm Mind, Recover, and Stored Power, Mega Latias can function as a potent defensive setup sweeper, while Choice Scarf sets can act as an effective revenge killer, allowing Victini to run a different item, and bring valuable utility moves such as Defog, Trick, and Healing Wish to support the team. However, Latias's weaknesses to Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks increase pressure on teammates such as Victini and Jirachi to check these threats. Mega Latias is also weak to common status conditions such as paralysis and Toxic, which prevent it from effectively sweeping. Mega Latias has competition from other valuable Psychic-type Mega Evolutions such as Mega Gallade and Mega Slowbro, which can help Psychic out in its troublesome Dark-type matchup or take on physical attackers such as Diggersby, respectively. Choice Scarf Latias has difficulties with common defensive Pokemon due to Psychic's low power and Draco Meteor's Special Attack reduction, while Mega Latias has limited coverage and must pick what it beats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Substitute can be run on Mega Latias to shut down any weak special attacks after a Calm Mind boost and avoid status moves such as Toxic. However, be aware that Chansey easily breaks the Substitute and can wear down Mega Latias.

The move also helps in the Ground matchup with by KOing Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Landorus. However, dropping Stored Power causes issues such as Ditto copying Mega Latias and hitting it with Ice Beam and Chansey walling Mega Latias. Latias can run Soul Dew to become a non-Choiced Defogger; however, this means it cannot be used as a revenge killer and cannot outspeed key Choice Scarf Pokemon like Heracross and setup Pokemon like Mega Charizard X after it uses Dragon Dance once.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Mega Latias can run a bulkier EV spread such as of 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 Spe and a Bold nature to more easily take physical attacks while setting up, but the loss of Speed makes it generally not worthwhile. Ice Beam may be run on the Calm Mind set to better take on take on Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, but this requires Latias to give up another more valuable move such as Stored Power or Thunderbolt. Refresh can be used over Thunderbolt to more easily set up on passive walls such as Chansey but leaves Mega Latias entirely ineffective against Dark-type Pokemon and more pressured by Haze users and phazers such as Mantine, Skarmory, and Toxapex. Surf hits the likes of Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran hard, but the coverage from Thunderbolt is more important for most Psychic-type teams. Mega Latias can run a support Defog set, but this generally isn't worth taking the valuable Mega slot from Mega Gallade or Mega Slowbro. Offensive support sets such as Soul Dew and Life Orb are generally outclassed by Latios in the same role, but they can fulfill the same role should Latios be running a different set.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Without Thunderbolt, Mega Latias is completely walled by Dark-types and therefore cannot do anything in the matchup. Even with Thunderbolt, it will have a hard time trying to set up and KO anything, since Alolan Muk can come in and force it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit: Latias is prone to getting Pursuit trapped by the likes of Tyranitar, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl, which can leave Latias badly damaged or KOed.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Physical Dragon-type moves from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Kyurem-B can KO Mega Latias easily. Latios has a chance to KO Mega Latias from full if Mega Latias hasn't set up a Calm Mind boost.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Latias has a hard time setting up with a Fairy-type around, with the likes of Mega Diancie, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Azumarill easily KOing Mega Latias if it doesn't have a Calm Mind set up.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt easily shuts down Mega Latias, and an unboosted Stored Power is nothing to be afraid of for Pokemon such as Heatran and Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users</strong>: Phazers such as Skarmory and Hippowdon can take advantage of Mega Latias's poor immediate power to get it off the field before it sets up. Mega Latias also has to watch out for Haze users such as Toxapex and Mantine, as they can get rid of its boosts and make Stored Power useless, but they have to be careful in case Mega Latias is running Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela tend to easily wall all Latias sets, leaving them unable to do much. This can also lead to easy setup with Mega Scizor and Bisharp, as they can shake off anything Latias throws at them.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: Strong physical attackers such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Mega Scizor can break Mega Latias and are not threatened by its unboosted attacks.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Alolan Muk: Alolan Muk can freely switch in on any move Latias has except Trick, and can threaten it out. To make matters worse, Alolan Muk can also punish switches with Pursuit and is such a large threat to Latias's team that it often cannot be switched into at all in any case.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor takes every attack Latias has, can recover off any damage, and proceed to threaten Latias's team with a sweep or simply gain momentum and deal heavy damage with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon are immune to Latias's Psychic-type STAB moves, greatly reducing the effectiveness of the Calm Mind Mega Latias set and forcing predictions any time the Choice Scarf Latias set needs to use Psychic. To make matters worse, the some Pokemon like Bisharp have secondary typings to aid them in taking Latias's other attacks, while other Pokemon like Tyranitar are simply bulky enough to take them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Heatran resist both of Latias's STAB moves, allowing them to switch into and pressure Choice Scarf Latias. While most passive Steel-type Pokemon that lack Toxic may be set up on and defeated by a boosted Stored Power or coverage move from the Calm Mind Mega Latias set, these Pokemon make Latias's job significantly more difficult.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Mantine can use their natural bulk to switch into Latias and force it out, often via Toxic, before proceeding to recover off any damage Latias has inflicted.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Clefable are immune to Draco Meteor and can threaten out Latias with supereffective attacks, but most struggle to break past Mega Latias after a few Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Toxic and Paralysis: If Latias is not running Refresh, both of these status effects are major issues for it. Toxic damages Latias and prevents it from staying in for more than a few turns, making sweeping almost impossible for Mega Latias and reducing the ability of the Choice Scarf set to switch in. Paralysis, meanwhile, halves Latias's Speed stat, and both of its sets rely heavily on being able to take advantage of Latias's excellent speed tier.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Diggersby and Dragonite make it difficult for Mega Latias to set up safely, as it cannot readily take them on without multiple Calm Mind boosts.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Calm Mind (Dragon)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind increases Mega Latias's power and bulk as it sets up to become a powerful sweeper. Recover helps gives Mega Latias a form of reliable recovery that it can use while it sets up with Calm Mind. Stored Power is a Psychic-type STAB attack that combines well with Calm Mind due to how naturally bulky Mega Latias is and how it gains 40 Base Power from each Calm Mind. This allows Mega Latias to beat common walls like Porygon2 and Zapdos. Refresh is used to keep status off of Mega Latias so it can beat walls such as Chansey and Cradily, which all usually carry a status-inducing move, and keep it healthy longer without having to be swapped out, since it can cure itself of status conditions. This allows Mega Latias to set up with Calm Mind and KO the walls in return with Stored Power. Thunderbolt can be run over Refresh to not be completely walled by Dark-type Pokemon. It also helps with Celesteela and Slowbro as well as common Haze users and phazers such as Mantine, Toxapex, and Skarmory. The downside to running Thunderbolt is that Mega Latias cannot get rid of status and will be put on a timer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is run with maximum Speed investment to outspeed common Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Cobalion. 252 HP EVs are run in order to make Mega Latias as bulky as possible to offer it more setup opportunities. Levitate allows Mega Latias to come in on Ground-type attacks for free and avoid entry hazards like Toxic Spikes, Spikes, and Sticky Web. Latiasite allows Latias to Mega Evolve.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Latias is a sweeper with Calm Mind and Stored Power, so it should set up mid- or late-game when its checks and counters, such as Diggersby and Excadrill, are weakened or KOed. Be wary of Pursuit users like Alolan Muk and Scizor, as they threaten to do a lot of damage, leaving Mega Latias in range for another Pokemon to KO it. Set up Mega Latias against walls that do not threaten it such as Gastrodon, Chansey, and Porygon2. Mega Latias can also set up on special attackers that do not carry super effective coverage like Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Landorus. Make sure to keep Mega Latias as healthy as possible with Recover while setting up with Calm Mind. Mega Latias can be brought in on resisted attacks and on Pokemon that are Choice-locked into non-super effective attacks. Avoid Toxic if not running Refresh, as it cripples Mega Latias and can put it on a timer, preventing it from effectively setting up and sweeping. Be careful not to set up on wallbreakers that can take an attack and 2HKO Mega Latias in return, such as Mega Diancie and Diggersby.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can aid with Stealth Rock, which wears down foes and breaks Focus Sashes so Latias can more easily sweep. Focus Sash variants of Garchomp can also take care of Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, which Mega Latias appreciates. It also aids in the Steel matchup, which Mega Latias struggles in, thanks to Fire Blast and Earthquake. Latios is the ideal Choice Scarf user for Dragon, as it helps with fast threats that Mega Latias struggles with such as Hydreigon and Blacephalon. It also provides Defog support to keep Stealth Rock off of the field for Mega Latias. Hydreigon is another option; the main way it supports Mega Latias is by threatening Steel- and Ghost-types that Mega Latias struggles to beat thanks to Fire Blast and Dark Pulse. It is a great special wallbreaker and weakens threats to Mega Latias thanks to the boost from Choice Specs. Kyurem-B is a great mixed wallbreaker with Life Orb that can be paired with Latias to help break Water and Flying teams, and it takes on Toxapex and Alolan Muk, which Mega Latias can struggle against. Kyurem-B can also run a Choice Scarf to help check Mega Altaria in the Dragon mirror. Dragonite is another good physical wallbreaker that can use Extreme Speed to snipe frail Pokemon such as Greninja. Its Fire Punch and Superpower help KO Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. Kommo-o is a great mixed sweeper that can deal with Steel-, Ice-, and Dark-types like Heatran, Mamoswine, and Alolan Muk that Mega Latias has trouble dealing with.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is the best Psychic STAB move for Latias to have, as it allows it to take on Fighting-type Pokemon like Terrakion and Heracross and provides reliable, consistent power. It also helps against bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur and Fairy-types like Azumarill and Tapu Koko. Draco Meteor is a hard-hitting move that can help take down physically defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Hippowdon, and Swampert. Defog allows Latias to provide entry hazard removal that can greatly improve its teammates' longevity. Healing Wish is the sole benefit of using Latias over Latios, as this allows Latias to fully heal a Pokemon that is severely weakened or statused that is still needed like Kyurem-B in the Water and Flying matchup or Hydreigon or Kommo-o in the Steel matchup, but it comes at the cost of losing Latias.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf with a Timid nature allows Latias to effectively keep faster foes in check and outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Blacephalon and faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Mega Latios. Levitate allows Latias to come in on Ground-type attacks, allowing it to avoid damage from entry hazards bar Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Utilize Latias's high Speed to revenge kill fast threats and setup sweepers such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard X, and Cloyster. Make sure to keep Latias away from Pursuit users like Bisharp, Alolan Muk, and Tyranitar, as these can KO it. These Pokemon can also take advantage of Latias OHKOing a Pokemon or come in when it is locked into Defog to Pursuit trap it. Latias can be used to come in on predicted Ground-type attacks from the likes of Hippowdon and Landorus thanks to Levitate. Use Defog on more passive Pokemon or Pokemon locked into moves that don't threaten Latias, but be careful, as the Choice lock means that Latias has to switch out right after it uses Defog, which opens up plenty of opportunities for your opponent to take advantage of by either setting up or switching to another Pokemon to threaten or Pursuit trap Latias. Use Healing Wish once a Pokemon that is needed is too worn down and Latias is no longer needed for removing entry hazards or revenge killing; it should only be used on Pokemon that are super beneficial to the matchup like Kyurem-B in the Flying and Water matchup or Kommo-o in the Dark or Steel matchup. Latias can also use Healing Wish to sacrifice itself for momentum, but Healing Wish should only be used like this to gain momentum that is needed for the matchup at hand either because of Mega Sableye or for the Steel matchup because of Bisharp or Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates like Kyurem-B and Dragonite appreciate Latias's Defog support as this allows the latter to keep its Multiscale intact and the former to come in without losing 1/4 of its HP due to Stealth Rock. Latias's Healing Wish also is important for Dragonite in the Normal and Steel matchup, and Kyurem-B also appreciates it, as this allows it to get back to full health in important matchups such as the Water and Flying matchup. Kyurem-B is a great Pokemon to pair Latias with in general due to how Kyurem-B can take care of Pokemon that Latias struggles with like Alolan Muk, Celesteela, Greninja, and Azumarill and how well it breaks balance build thanks to its coverage. Garchomp is a must-have for Dragon teams, as it is the only good Stealth Rock user that Dragon has. This can help secure KOs with Latias like against Terrakion and Heracross. Dragonite is a powerful wallbreaker to help with Pokemon that Latias struggles with, like taking out Chansey with Superpower. It can also take care of threats like Greninja thanks to Multiscale and Extreme Speed and Mega Scizor thanks to Fire Punch. Hydreigon is another great Pokemon to pair with Latias because it can take care of Ghost-types like Gengar and Blacephalon that Latias can struggle with. Mega Altaria is the ideal Mega Pokemon to pair with Latias because of its Fairy typing to help with Dark-types like Mega Sableye and Hydreigon. Furthermore, it can relieve pressure off of Latias in the Dragon mirror matchup thanks to hard stopping the opponent from spamming Dragon-type moves. It can also utilize a support set, as it is another Defog user that can freely use its moves thanks to not being Choiced-locked. Kommo-o can also be used to help with Steel-, Normal-, and Dark-types thanks to its Fighting typing and to become a setup sweeper thanks to Kommonium Z omniboosting Kommo-o's stats. This allows Latias some relief when facing Dark-types like Bisharp and Sharpedo and furthers helps with walls that Latias struggles to break in the Normal matchup like Porygon2 and Chansey. By using Choice Scarf Latias, Latios is free to run a more offensive set like Soul Dew or Life Orb with Calm Mind to break through walls that Latias cannot, such as Chansey, Porygon2, and Mantine.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind boosts Mega Latias's Special Attack and Special Defense, rendering it more powerful offensively and allowing it to take on strong special attackers such as Greninja and Mega Diancie after a few boosts. Recover restores Mega Latias's HP, allowing it to safely set up Calm Mind throughout the match. Stored Power scales with all of Mega Latias's stat boosts, which gives Mega Latias a powerful wallbreaking tool that has great synergy with Calm Mind. Thunderbolt hits Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mega Sableye that take little to no damage from Stored Power and allows Latias to deal some damage in matches where it cannot set up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Mega Latias's speed, allowing it to Speed tie with the crowded base 110 Speed tier and outpace threats such as Garchomp, Blacephalon, and Alolan Ninetales. 252 HP EVs maximize Mega Latias's mixed bulk. Latiasite is required for Latias to transform into Mega Latias and receive key buffs to its bulk and damage output. Levitate is the only ability available to Latias, but it's handy to take on Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and avoid Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid sending Latias in until any Dark-type Pokemon on the opposing team have been weakened or KOed, as Mega Latias is reliant on uninvested Thunderbolt to deal any damage to them. Bring Mega Latias in on Pokemon it walls such as Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo to safely set up; setting up on special attackers is generally preferable to physical attackers, as Calm Mind's Special Defense boosts mean Latias needs to use Recover less often. Avoid Toxic, as the rapidly increasing passive damage prevents Latias from effectively setting up or sweeping; while Latias does not enjoy the passive damage, getting Latias burned by Will-O-Wisp or Scald can be helpful to protect it from Toxic in the Water- and Ghost-type matchups. Even if Mega Latias cannot sweep in a matchup, it can still act as a solid defensive tank and take on threats such as Heatran and Choice Scarf Excadrill. Keep Mega Latias healthy until it needs to set up in matchups like Electric and Flying, where it plays a pivotal role in Psychic's victory.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini pairs extremely well with Mega Latias, being able to take on Steel- and Bug-type Pokemon that give Mega Latias trouble; in return, Mega Latias can take on Water- and Ground-type Pokemon like Seismitoad and Rotom-W that threaten Victini. Alakazam checks threatening offensive Pokemon such as Alolan Muk, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Heracross for Mega Latias with its attacks and Counter and appreciates Mega Latias's ability to take on defensive Pokemon that easily sponge Alakazam's attacks, such as Mantine and Porygon2. Jirachi covers Mega Latias's weaknesses to Dragon- and Ice-type attacks, while Mega Latias takes on most Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon for Jirachi; Jirachi can also give Latias a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish. Mew can take on phazers and Toxic users that Mega Latias hates with its stallbreaker set, which Latias can then use to make a clean sweep. Latios acts as an effective Choice Scarf user, taking on fast threats such as Life Orb Greninja, and makes up for the lack of a Dragon-type STAB move on Mega Latias in the Dragon-type matchup. Slowbro can take on Ice-type attacks for Latias and appreciates Latias checking Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon. It can also serve as an effective check to physical wallbreakers like Mamoswine that give Mega Latias trouble and bluff being the team's Mega Evolution.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latias's strongest STAB move and its best option for revenge killing healthy Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo, but its Special Attack drops mean Latias must often switch out after using it. Psychic is a weaker but more reliable secondary STAB move that hits Fairy-type Pokemon and doesn't force Latias to switch out. Defog clears entry hazards off the field, taking pressure off hazard-weak teammates such as Victini and preventing Toxic Spikes from putting the entire team on a timer. Trick allows Latias to punish defensive switch-ins such as Alolan Muk, Chansey, and Mantine by removing their item and locking them into a single attack, while Healing Wish is another option to breathe life back into an injured teammate, allowing them another chance to sweep; this is particularly beneficial for the likes of Mega Gallade and Victini, which often get too worn down when breaking their checks to fully fulfill their role.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs, Choice Scarf, and a Timid nature are used to maximize Latias's Speed, allowing it to outpace the entire unboosted metagame and most Choice Scarf users or Speed-boosting attackers, most notably Victini and Mega Sharpedo. 252 Special Attack EVs are used to maximize Latias's damage output and allow it to threaten as many Pokemon as possible. Levitate is Latias's only ability, but it provides a useful immunity to Ground-type attacks and allows Latias to freely Defog away Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, the last of which is particularly useful against Bug-type teams to check the likes of Choice Scarf Heracross.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to its Choice Scarf, Latias can revenge kill fast threats such as Life Orb Greninja, Mega Lopunny, +1 Mega Sharpedo, and Landorus, forcing them out or picking up the KO. Draco Meteor hits extremely hard even without a boosting item, making it Latias's best choice against most neutral targets such as Mega Charizard Y and Hippowdon; should the opponent have a Fairy-type Pokemon such as Azumarill or Tapu Koko, however, Psychic is often a better pick, since it doesn't offer a free opportunity to switch in. Be prepared to switch out Latias frequently after using Draco Meteor, as the drop in Special Attack makes it relatively easy to set up on. Choice Scarf renders Defog a risky play, as it gives the foe two turns to set up or even simply KO Latias, but it's usually still worthwhile to remove multiple hazard layers or to improve the longevity of your wincon, particularly on free turns such as forced switches or against passive Pokemon like Mantine. Refrain from using Trick until the threats Latias is needed for, such as Tapu Koko and Landorus-T, are dealt with; when the time to use Trick comes, aim to catch special walls such as Chansey and Celesteela on the switch. Similarly, it's important to wait to use Healing Wish until Latias is no longer needed or it becomes necessary to bring back a teammate from the brink, such as Mega Gallade against Poison.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gallade pairs well with Latias; it takes on Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Alolan Muk, while Latias deals with the faster attackers that threaten Gallade such as Life Orb Greninja and can cripple defensive walls with Trick or give Mega Gallade a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish. Victini appreciates Choice Scarf Latias freeing up its item slot, allowing it to run a different set such as Z-Celebrate or Choice Band. Victini also appreciates the fact that Latias checks threatening Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Keldeo. Deoxys-S sets entry hazards, which make it more costly to switch to a defensive answer and slowly wear down any opposing walls looking to absorb Latias's attacks. Nasty Plot Mew likes Latias's ability to cripple specially defensive walls that give it trouble such as Chansey; in return, Mew can blow past the likes of Heatran with Focus Blast. Jirachi can take on Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type Pokemon for Latias as well as set Stealth Rock to make it harder for the foe to switch, while Latias acts as a deterrent to Fire- and Ground-type attacks and reduces the pressure on Jirachi to use Thunder Wave to cripple fast attackers. Latios enjoys the freedom to run items other than Choice Scarf without worry, and both enjoy having the other to wear down shared answers such as Celesteela and Heatran. Alakazam is helpful to revenge kill threats that Latias cannot, such as healthy Mega Gyarados, Scolipede, and Bisharp, with Magic Guard + Focus Sash. Slowbro is useful to sponge attacks after Latias has to switch out, such as after using Draco Meteor, especially for Ice-type attacks. Mega Slowbro in particular also appreciates Latias's ability to bluff being a Mega Evolution.</p> "

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Latios is one of the best revenge killers Dragon teams have to offer thanks to its great Special Attack and Speed stats. When given a Choice Scarf, Latios can revenge kill or threaten to KO numerous foes, including Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Nihilego. Additionally, being the fastest viable Dragon-type, Latios becomes a key threat to opposing Dragon teams, as it's able to outspeed and OHKO most opposing Dragon-types. Latios's access to Defog is essential to Dragon teams, as clearing entry hazards becomes very valuable when many of its teammates, such as Kyurem-B and Dragonite, are vulnerable to them. Latios can also lure in and cripple special walls like Chansey and Ferrothorn by giving them a Choice Scarf with Trick. Alternatively, Latios is one of the few Dragon-types that can effectively lure and OHKO Mega Diancie, a troublesome threat for Dragon teams to deal with, by using Hidden Power Steel. With its ability Levitate, Latios gains an immunity to Ground-type moves and all entry hazards but Stealth Rock, giving it more opportunities to switch in and revenge kill foes or use Defog. However, Latios's secondary Psychic typing makes it weak to common Bug- and Dark-type moves like U-turn and Pursuit, both of which can KO it and make Dragon teams lose momentum. Moreover, even with Latios's decent bulk, it still falls prey to strong priority moves, such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch and +2 Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Finally, Latios is unable to seriously harm specially defensive walls, such as Celesteela and Zapdos, even if they're neutral to its STAB moves.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Latios's blistering Speed, high Special Attack, and solid offensive typing make it a staple pick on Psychic teams. Levitate allows Latios to switch into Ground-type attacks such as Sand Rush Excadrill's Earthquake and Landorus's Earth Power. Its part Dragon typing gives Latios a myriad of resistances, allowing it to easily switch into many attacks such as Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, Volcarona's Fire Blast, Keldeo's Hydro Pump, and Celebi's Giga Drain. This allows it to more easily perform the plethora of roles it fills for Psychic teams. Since Latios is capable of running multiple viable sets, it can be somewhat unpredictable, making it tricky to deal with before its set has been revealed. The most common of these sets in Choice Scarf allows it to act as a revenge killer and emergency Defogger. However, being locked into Defog allows most Stealth Rock users to easily punish Latios. With this set, it can also cripple walls such as Chansey and Toxapex with Trick. Calm Mind allows Latios to act as a fearsome setup Pokemon that can break past its standard checks such as Alolan Muk and Porygon2 thanks to its powerful nuke in Devastating Drake. Access to reliable recovery in Roost allows it to use this set successfully. Choice Specs makes Latios a powerful wallbreaker, making it hard for most teams without a Dragon-type switch-in to deal with. Lastly, its coverage allows it to target foes that Draco Meteor does not hit.  Mega Latios finds itself on balance and offensive Psychic-type teams, being a fantastic Steel- and Poison-type breaker with access to Earthquake and Hidden Power Fire. However, Mega Latios competes for the Mega slot with many Pokemon on Psychic-type teams, such as Mega Latias, which is a bulky setup sweeper, Mega Gallade, which can help in the Normal- and Steel-type matchups, and Mega Slowbro, which is a physical wall and defensive setup wincon. Even though Latios has all these fantastic qualities, it can be revenge killed by common priority attacks in the tier such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. Latios's most potent attack in Draco Meteor has a nasty downside, often forcing it to switch out, allowing the opponent to take advantage of the forced switch. Due to this Latios often finds itself walled by special walls such as Chansey and Ferrothorn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Latios has access to a wide variety of coverage moves like Thunderbolt and Surf and can use one of them in its last moveslot to lure and KO specific threats, such as Mantine and Celesteela with Thunderbolt and Heatran and Excadrill with Surf. However, most of these threats are already covered by Latios's teammates and aren't generally worth replacing either Trick, Hidden Power Steel, or even Ice Beam for another move. Memento is a neat option for Latios's fourth move to give a teammate like Kommo-o or Dragon Dance Dragonite a late-game opportunity to freely come onto the field and set up while taking minimal damage. On the other hand, Latios's utility in revenge killing, cleaning late-game, and clearing entry hazards generally far surpasses the utility provided by Memento, as Dragon teams will no longer be able to remove any kind of entry hazard or outspeed opposing fast Choice Scarf users. If the team wants to use another way of keeping faster foes in check than Latios, it can make good use of Life Orb or Soul Dew to be able to use non-Choice-locked Defog, which can be a huge help for the Dragon team, which is typically very Stealth Rock weak. However, Latios is a much-needed Choice Scarf user on Dragon teams thanks to its superior Speed stat and firepower, so it is generally better to give it a Choice Scarf instead.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Life Orb and Soul Dew can be run on teams that do not need Latios to act as a Choice Scarf user, allowing it to switch between Defog and other attacks freely. However, this will force Victini to run Choice Scarf, effectively taking away its wallbreaking power. While this would improve matchups such as Bug, it severely reduces effectivity in most other matchups. Hidden Power Fire can be run over Thunderbolt on its Choice Specs set, allowing it to target different Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, instead of just Celesteela. Draco Meteor is Mega Latios's strongest STAB attack, allowing it to break Pokemon like Mega Sableye. However, running Draco Meteor means that it can no longer run Psychic, allowing Pokemon like Toxapex to wall it.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: As they resist both of Latios's STAB moves, Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Celesteela are natural counters to Latios, with the former using it as setup fodder and the latter simply whittling it down with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dedicated walls like Chansey and Mantine easily sponge Latios's moves and can set Stealth Rock or burn the switch-in with Scald in return, and they only fear Trick.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: All Fairy-types can freely switch into Latios's strongest STAB move, Draco Meteor, before KOing or crippling it beyond repair. Specifically, Clefable can't be 2HKOed by Latios and Klefki has the added benefits of resisting Latios's Psyshock and pressuring it with a Prankster Thunder Wave, possibly paralyzing Latios or one of its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Pokemon like Greninja and Mega Tyranitar are immune to Latios's Psychic; furthermore, the former can outspeed Latios with a Choice Scarf of its own, while the latter takes minimal damage from Draco Meteor thanks to its great bulk in the sand.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers: Scizor, Alolan Muk, and Mega Aerodactyl all can trap and KO Latios or at least seriously damage it. The former two also have the bulk and typings required to directly switch into Latios's moves before Pursuit trapping it.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Latios has to be wary of Pokemon that often carry Thunder Wave like Jirachi and Thundurus, as a paralyzed Latios would not be able to efficiently revenge kill anymore, essentially meaning that Latios is crippled for the rest of the game.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Pokemon like Chansey, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn can tank Latios's attacks and retaliate by attacking it with moves such as Stone Edge and Gyro Ball or targeting it with status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave them on with some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon have the unique trait of being immune to Dragon, allowing them to easily switch into Latios, since a majority of the time it will click Draco Meteor.

        "name": "Revenge Killer (Dragon)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor, despite lowering its Special Attack by two stages, is Latios's strongest and most reliable move for revenge killing, OHKOing the likes of Kyurem-B and Mega Sharpedo. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that KOes and pressures numerous threats with a weaker Defense stat like Volcarona and Mantine. Defog removes any entry hazards on the field to preserve the health of Latios's teammates like Dragonite and Kyurem-B. Trick is used to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Celesteela by replacing their valuable items with a Choice Scarf. Hidden Power Steel is a viable option over Trick to lure and OHKO Mega Diancie, a dangerous threat to Dragon teams. Ice Beam is an interesting coverage option that hits multiple targets, including problematic foes like opposing Latios without a Special Attack drop and Mega Altaria.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf lets Latios be as fast as possible, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame as well as opposing Choice Scarf users like Nihilego and Buzzwole. It also needs maximum investment in Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. Levitate lets Latios safely switch into Spikes and Toxic Spikes before Defogging them away and provides an immunity to Ground-type moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Latios is best used when it's preserved to check fast threats to Dragon teams, such as Tapu Koko and setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X. On the other hand, Latios's decent typing and bulk let it switch into some resisted moves like Mega Charizard Y's Focus Blast. When revenge killing foes, be careful of doing so with Draco Meteor. Due to its nasty side effect of dropping Latios's Special Attack by two stages, Latios is forced to switch out and lose momentum for the team, as it can otherwise become setup fodder to strong sweepers like Mew and Bisharp. Also, be wary of Fairy- and Dark-types on the opposing team, such as Tapu Koko on Electric and Greninja on Water, as the former group is immune to Latios's Draco Meteor while the latter group is unaffected by its Psyshock. In both scenarios, Latios is forced out. Latios can Defog entry hazards in many circumstances; for instance, it's recommended to use Defog when Latios forces out a slower Pokemon or a foe that is Choice-locked into a resisted move, such as a Keldeo locked into Secret Sword, or against a wall that doesn't threaten Latios, such as Mantine. Additionally, like all other entry hazard removers, Latios can even directly switch into some hazard setters that it forces out, such as Hippowdon and Swampert, in order to use Defog as they switch out. However, locking Latios into Defog can give dangerous setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mimikyu free setup opportunities. Lastly, use Trick to lure in and cripple expected switch-ins like Chansey and Mantine for the remainder of the game by trading their item for a Choice Scarf. Moreover, crippling Stealth Rock setters like Heatran and Hippowdon makes it much easier for Latios to clear entry hazards throughout the match, which greatly helps its teammates to come on the field unharmed. On the other hand, unless Latios is no longer needed to outspeed specific threats on the opposing team, such as Tapu Koko, it is better to keep the Choice Scarf for itself, as Latios then becomes easy to revenge kill.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Every Dragon team appreciates having Latios as a teammate to remove entry hazards with Defog and efficiently revenge kill threats. Dragonite is a powerful physical wallbreaker that blasts through Latios's checks like Mantine and Heatran and helps immensely in the Steel matchup, where Latios doesn't do much besides helping keep faster foes in check, and it also helps Latios with the Normal matchup. In return, Latios can remove Stealth Rock with Defog so that Dragonite can keep its Multiscale intact when it enters the field. Additionally, Dragonite brings Dragon's best priority option with Extreme Speed. Kyurem-B is an excellent mixed wallbreaker that greatly helps Latios against balance builds such as Flying and Steel so that it has an easier time cleaning the opposing team. In return, Latios takes care of Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo while removing Stealth Rock and other entry hazards with Defog for Kyurem-B. Kommo-o is a useful sweeper that greatly helps in the Dark, Normal, and Steel matchups that Latios has lots of trouble against, while Latios removes problematic Toxic Spikes that greatly hinder Kommo-o and cleans late-game after Kommo-o has partly swept the opposing team. Choice Specs Hydreigon is a secondary wallbreaker that mainly deals with Steel- and Psychic-types that resist Latios's STAB moves, such as Skarmory and Jirachi, and can switch into Dark- and Ghost-type moves aimed at Latios. In return, Latios breaks problematic Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Buzzwole and cleans the opposing team after Hydreigon has punched holes in it. Garchomp is yet another teammate that breaks Steel-types with Ground- and Fire-type moves in addition to setting up Stealth Rock to discourage opposing teams from switching in and out too often. Mega Altaria is a threatening sweeper that can take on Dark-types that trouble Latios like Mega Sableye and Tyranitar, while Latios can deal with annoying Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex for Mega Altaria. Mega Latias is a different bulky setup sweeper that can break bulkier teams and use some of Latios's checks, such as Chansey and Ferrothorn, as setup fodder. However, using both Latios and Mega Latias in the same team will amplify the Bug, Dark and Ghost weaknesses, so it's highly recommended to wisely choose the other teammates to counter this issue.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's main STAB move that allows it to score KOs against threats such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Charizard X. Psyshock allows Latios to hit specially defensive walls such as Mantine while also being able to nail a significant threat in boosted Quiver Dance Volcarona. Defog lets Latios remove entry hazards from the field. Trick allows Latios to cripple walls such as Alolan Muk and Porygon2, locking them into one move with Choice Scarf. Memento is an option over Trick that grants Latios the ability to carve a path for its teammates such as Mega Gallade and Celebi to set up a sweep.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Timid nature alongside Choice Scarf allows Latios to hit as fast and as hard as possible. Choice Scarf allows it to become one of the fastest Pokemon in the game, outspeeding threats such as Greninja and Choice Scarf Blacephalon, making it a fantastic revenge killer. Levitate allows Latios to avoid most entry hazards such as Sticky Web and Spikes, allowing it to get off a Defog more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to the nature of this Latios set, it is best used throughout the game as a revenge killer. With its Choice Scarf, it can easily revenge kill numerous threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. Thanks to this, it is one of the most valuable Pokemon in the Dragon matchup, allowing it to claim a KO with Draco Meteor and then switch out to a defensive teammate such as Jirachi or Slowbro. Latios should be preserved for troublesome Pokemon it can take care of such as Hydreigon and Volcarona. Use Defog against Pokemon Latios forces out; this allows Latios to get off a Defog without losing health. However, if the entry hazard setter is still around, Latios should switch out to a teammate that can handle it. On the same note, do not let Latios get Pursuit trapped. This means it is worth switching out Latios from battle if a Pursuit user such as Alolan Muk on Poison teams is still alive. When against walls that Latios and its teammates struggle to take on such as Mandibuzz and Chansey, it should cripple them with Trick, locking them into one move. However, Latios should be careful of when it Tricks away its Choice Scarf, as now it can be revenge killed by faster threats such as Greninja and Tapu Koko. Latios should also be careful of Pokemon that can Mega Evolve and Z-Move users, as they can take advantage of its Trick and get a free turn. Finally, Latios can use Memento to support teammates such as Nasty Plot Celebi and Swords Dance Mega Gallade by weakening the foe, allowing them to set up with more ease.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios's teammates appreciate its ability to clear entry hazards and beat faster Pokemon such as Nihilego and Mega Pinsir. Victini greatly appreciates Latios being able to run Choice Scarf in its stead, allowing it to act as a better wallbreaker with Choice Band. It can pretty much claim a KO each time it comes in, as barely anything can take a Choice Band-boosted V-create, breaking past typical Latios answers such as Chansey with ease. Mega Gallade can break past Latios's answers such as Alolan Muk and Tyranitar with Close Combat. It also appreciates the Memento support Latios can provide, as this lets it set up with more ease. Alakazam provides an emergency check to dangerous physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Alolan Muk with Counter and to a significant threat in Mimikyu with Shadow Ball, thanks to Magic Guard and Focus Sash. Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support, allowing Latios to take on threats such as Volcarona more easily. Jirachi can also cripple faster Pokemon such as Greninja with Thunder Wave as well as tank Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves for Latios such as Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard, Mega Diancie's Moonblast, and opposing Latios's Draco Meteor. In return, Latios provides a Ground-type immunity for Jirachi. Mew can cripple walls for Latios with Taunt + Knock Off, allowing it to dismantle Pokemon such as Celesteela and Chansey for Latios completely. It can also cripple physical attackers such as Excadrill and Mega Swampert with Will-O-Wisp, allowing Latios to switch into their attacks more easily. Celebi can break past Water- and Steel-type Pokemon for Latios thanks to Nasty Plot and great STAB and coverage attacks in Giga Drain, Earth Power, and Hidden Power Fire. This allows it to take on Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Heatran after its Air Balloon has been broken, and Mega Scizor for Latios. Additionally, Celebi can also be used as the team's Stealth Rock user, since its access to recovery makes it more reliable than Jirachi. Thanks to its defensive attributes and Grass typing it becomes very useful in the Fairy-type matchup, allowing it to easily wall the type bar Mimikyu. Celebi also can act as a status absorber for Latios thanks to Natural Cure. Metagross can act as a dangerous physical wallbreaker and most importantly threaten Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Mimikyu with Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch as well as break past Latios's checks such as Chansey and Ferrothorn with Hammer Arm. Slowbro acts as a physical wall, allowing it to check many Pokemon that threaten Latios such as Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Mega Lopunny. On top of this it provides a solid neutrality to Ice-type attacks thanks to Slack Off and Regenerator, allowing it to switch into multiple attacks throughout the game.</p> "

        "name": "Dragonium Z + Calm Mind (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's main STAB move that lets it take on Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Kommo-o. Thunderbolt allows Latios to hit Pokemon such as Celesteela, which resists Draco Meteor, for super effective damage. It also allows Latios to threaten Flying and Water teams in tandem with Draco Meteor. Calm Mind allows Latios to become a powerful setup sweeper, allowing it to tank Greninja's attacks and OHKO Slowbro with Draco Meteor. Roost gives Latios a reliable form of recovery, allowing it to set up Calm Mind with more ease.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment alongside a Timid nature allows Latios to hit as fast and hard as possible. This allows it to revenge kill prominent Pokemon such as Keldeo and Landorus. Dragonium Z turns Latios's Draco Meteor into Devastating Drake, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Toxapex after a single Calm Mind boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While Latios's most reliable move is Draco Meteor, it should be careful of when it uses it. Since it cuts Latios's Special Attack in half after one use, it is forced to switch out often, allowing the opponent to play around Latios. However, if Latios can pick up a KO with Draco Meteor and no threatening Pokemon can freely switch in, it should click Draco Meteor. Latios should set up Calm Mind against Pokemon it forces out or Pokemon that cannot touch it such as Landorus, allowing it to take advantage of the free switch, and set up Calm Mind. Latios should save Devastating Drake for when it can be guaranteed to pick up a KO or put a foe in the range of its attacks. If a Fairy-type is present on the opponent's side of the field, it might be best to save Devastating Drake. However, it should always be used if the Pokemon in front of Latios threatens the rest of the team such as Bisharp. Latios should keep its health up throughout the match with Roost, allowing it to continually switch into attacks such as Landorus's Sludge Wave and Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast. This also allows Latios to set up Calm Mind more easily, so keeping Latios as healthy as possible is most of the time the most optimal play. However, if the foe can afflict Latios with status, it is best to switch out and find a safer time to set up, as being paralyzed or poisoned severely hinders Latios's ability to act as a setup sweeper. Latios should be used to break apart Water- and Flying-type teams, since Devastating Drake can dent both types and it can use Thunderbolt to pick off Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Celesteela, which either are immune to or resist its Dragon-type STAB move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini can break past Latios's checks such as Chansey and Ferrothorn with its Choice Band-boosted V-create, allowing Latios to clean up more easily late-game. Victini can also cripple walls such as Tyranitar with Trick, allowing Latios to take them on with more ease. In return, Latios provides Victini with a Ground immunity and can break past its checks such as Swampert with Devastating Drake. Latios can also switch into Water-types such as Keldeo thanks to Roost. Choice Scarf Latias frees up Latios to run this wallbreaker set, as the former takes on the role of the Choice Scarf Defogger. It can revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon for Latios as well as provide it with Healing Wish support so it can have a second chance to sweep. Mega Gallade is a fantastic partner for Latios, as they naturally break past the other's checks. Gallade can take on specially defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos for Latios, which can break past Mandibuzz for Mega Gallade in return. Mega Gallade can also pick off weakened Pokemon such as Mimikyu with its Disguise broken through Shadow Sneak. Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support for Latios as well as a handful of critical resistances to Fairy- and Ice-type attacks, taking such foes on with Iron Head. In return, Latios provides a Ground immunity for Jirachi. Jirachi can pivot Latios in safely with slow U-turn and cripple faster foes such as Kommo-o with Thunder Wave. Alakazam provides Latios with an emergency check to all physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Alolan Muk thanks to its ability Magic Guard alongside Focus Sash and Counter. It can also help break past Steel-and Ghost-types for Latios such as Ferrothorn with its Focus Blast and Alolan Marowak with Shadow Ball. Mew acts as a stallbreaker, crippling all walls for Latios. With Knock Off + Taunt, it can successfully cripple all walls by removing their items such as Porygon2's Eviolite and prevent them from recovering off damage with Taunt. Additionally, it can cripple physical attackers such as Excadrill and Mega Swampert with Will-O-Wisp, allowing Latios to beat them more comfortably. Slowbro can take pressure off Latios to act as a switch-in to Ground-type attacks thanks to enormous physical bulk, allowing it to switch into attackers such as Mamoswine. It can also provide utility in Thunder Wave, slowing down faster threats for Latios. Additionally, it provides Scald support, sporting a chance to burn the foe and in tandem, with Colbur Berry it can check threats such as Bisharp. Deoxys-S can set up dual screens and Stealth Rock for Latios on hyper offensive teams. Additionally, Deoxys-S can cripple walls and attackers with Knock Off being able to remove key items such as Victini's Choice Scarf and Chansey's Eviolite. It can also prevent other entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn from setting up their entry hazards with Taunt.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest STAB move that acts as a nuke, allowing it to blow past Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Mega Sableye. Psyshock allows Latios to nail specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, as well as providing a way to hit threats such as Volcarona after a Quiver Dance boost. Surf allows Latios to nail Pokemon that resist both of its STAB attacks such as Heatran for super effective damage as well as OHKO Mega Diancie. Thunderbolt allows Latios to take on Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Mantine, Celesteela, and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment alongside a Timid nature allows Latios to be as fast as possible. Maximum Special Attack investment and Choice Specs help Latios become a powerful wallbreaker, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to the amount of sheer immediate power Choice Specs brings, Latios acts as a nuke and should click Draco Meteor to pick up a KO. However, make sure to use Draco Meteor at the proper time, as the immediate drop in Latios's Special Attack can allow threatening Pokemon such as Alolan Muk to quickly take advantage of it. Since Latios is locked into an attack due to Choice Specs, it should try to predict what the opponent will do and select the appropriate coverage attack. For example, if you are facing Steel and the opponent has Celesteela out, it is appropriate to click Thunderbolt. However, if it uses Protect on Latios, it can then switch out into a Pokemon that can better take on Thunderbolt such as Ferrothorn. At this point, Latios should switch out to a teammate that can take on the switch. Latios heavily depends on its item to get off massive damage. Therefore, it should avoid getting its item removed from Knock Off. It should also avoid paralysis, as that severely cuts its Speed, allowing more Pokemon to take it on such as Diggersby. Being poisoned or burned also chips Latios and should be avoided; however, they are not as crippling to Latios as paralysis is. Latios can bluff a Choice Scarf set, allowing it to lure in checks such as Porygon2 and 2HKO them with the second Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock chip damage. Additionally, it can force out specially defensive Pokemon by bluffing Trick and proceeding to nuke the opponent's Latios switch-in. However, once the opponent realizes Latios does not carry Trick, they can much more easily play around it with their specially defensive walls.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gallade appreciates Latios's ability to immediately get rid of threats such as Mandibuzz and Skarmory with its STAB and coverage attacks. In return, it can take on Pokemon such as Chansey and Ferrothorn for Latios. Victini can patch up the lack of Fire coverage on Latios and take on Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn for it. It can also cripple walls with Trick, locking them into one move, allowing Latios to take them on more easily. Mew can act as a stallbreaker for this set; with Knock Off, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp it can cripple opposing walls such as Gastrodon as well as burn foes, chipping them for Latios. It can completely take on all walls bar Mega Sableye and weaken them for Latios. It can also act as a setup sweeper with Genesis Supernova and Nasty Plot, breaking down shared checks with Latios, thanks to its powerful Terrain-boosted Psychic-type STAB move. Jirachi can paralyze faster foes such as Greninja for Latios while providing key resistances to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks. It also provides Stealth Rock support and can pivot Latios in safely with U-turn. Alakazam is an emergency check to any non-Ghost-type physical attacker such as Excadrill with Focus Sash + Magic Guard and Counter. It also can check Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mimikyu with Shadow Ball that could otherwise easily take on Latios. Celebi is a special setup sweeper that can patch up holes in Latios's coverage, adding Grass-, Ground-, and Fire-type coverage to check a multitude of Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. Celebi can also act as a specially defensive wall, allowing it to be the team's Stealth Rock user and can pivot in Latios safely with slow U-turn. Celebi also can act as a status absorber for Latios thanks to Natural Cure. Slowbro can cripple fast threats such as Mega Lopunny and Greninja with Thunder Wave while acting as a reliable physical wall thanks to Slack Off and Regenerator. Additionally, it can switch into threats to Latios such as Mamoswine thanks to it acting as a solid Ice-type resistance. Metagross can take on Fairy-type Pokemon for Latios such as Mega Diancie and Azumarill with its powerful STAB attack in Meteor Mash and priority move in Bullet Punch. Additionally, it can act as a solid Dragon-type switch-in for Latios due to its resistance to Dragon and its good natural bulk.</p> "

Latiosite allows Latios to Mega Evolve and gives it a boost in Attack and Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Latios should be used to pressure Steel-types with the combination of Earthquake and Hidden Power Fire, since all common Steel-types bar Celesteela are 2HKOed by its coverage. Keep Mega Latios at near full health the entire game so it can continue to wallbreak. Mega Latios should switch into special wallbreakers that other teammates cannot wall, such as Mega Charizard Y, and Recover off the damage done. Mega Latios should avoid Thunder Wave and Toxic, as the former prevents it from outspeeding key threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Mega Scizor, while the latter puts it on a timer that limits its time in battle. Latios can bluff a Choice Scarf set in the Poison matchup in order to lure in checks such as Alolan Muk, proceeding to 2HKO it with Earthquake rather than being Pursuit trapped.

Mew can also support Mega Latios offensively by opting to run a Double Dance set, allowing it to beat common Choice Scarf Pokemon that threaten Mega Latios such as Heracross and Greninja after a Rock Polish. In return, Mega Latios can beat Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Alolan Muk for Mew with Hidden Power Fire and Earthquake, respectively. Jirachi can set up Stealth Rock for Mega Latios and provide a Fairy- and Dragon-type switch-in for it. In return, Mega Latios can take care of Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn with Psychic and Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Victini forms an amazing Steel-type breaking core with Latios. In addition, Victini can break through Pokemon like Celesteela, Chansey, and Porygon2 for Mega Latios, while Mega Latios can break through Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex for Victini. With access to Focus Sash and Counter, Alakazam acts as a last-ditch check to any non Ghost-type physical attacker such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Mega Charizard X while at full health. Alakazam can also help take on Pokemon like Mega Sableye for Mega Latios by running Dazzling Gleam. Latias can bluff as the team's Mega Evolution while also being able to provide Healing Wish support for Mega Latios, giving it a second chance to sweep. In return, Latios can take care of Pokemon like Alolan Muk, which give Latias trouble. Slowbro can also bluff the Mega Evolution slot and can take on Pokemon like Mega Sharpedo for Mega Latios. In return, Mega Latios can take on Pokemon like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk for it. Metagross can help Mega Latios take on Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie.

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Jirachi is an excellent defensive Pokemon with one of the best available secondary typings in Steel, letting it provide Psychic teams with a solid set of resistances that includes Fairy and Steel, a Poison immunity, and a vital Bug-type neutrality, which Psychic generally lacks on defensive Pokemon. Base 100 stats across the board let Jirachi act as an incredible defensive asset for Psychic teams, especially when utilizing U-turn. U-turn specifically lets Jirachi act as a slow, defensive pivot in order to safely bring in teammates and get favorable matchups. Thanks to its Poison immunity, Jirachi is able to avoid Toxic, which makes it an incredibly effective defensive Pokemon on Psychic. Due to its rather vast movepool and expansive utility kit, which includes Healing Wish, Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Wish, Jirachi can fill a multitude of roles on Psychic teams, including a Stealth Rock setter, status spreader, and strong pivot. Jirachi's ability, Serene Grace, gives it the opportunity to take down slower opposing Pokemon with Iron Head's doubled flinch rate, especially if paired with Thunder Wave. However, Jirachi is plagued by being limited to four moveslots, which limits the number of roles it can effectively fill on Psychic.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Jirachi is a good offensive option on Steel teams thanks to its good typing, great all-around stats, and access to a great setup move in Z-Happy Hour. This combination of traits allows it to help Steel in important matchups like Poison and Water. Z-Happy Hour also allows Jirachi to function as a great late-game cleaner, boosting all of its stats by one stage and allowing it to shrug off many revenge killers due to its increased defenses. Jirachi's Psychic typing grants it a neutrality to Fighting and gives Steel a reliable answer to threatening Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex thanks to its super effective STAB moves. Jirachi also has the option to utilize a bulky Calm Mind set and pose as a sturdier sweeper, taking advantage of defensive cores to set up and break Water- and Flying-type teams with more reliability compared to the Z-Happy Hour set with its one-time boost.  Additionally, Jirachi's above-average bulk for an offensive Pokemon alongside good coverage options such as Thunderbolt also allows it to threaten more defensive types such as Water and Flying. However, Jirachi finds itself overly dependent on Z-Happy Hour in order to dent teams, as its damage output leaves a lot to be desired when unboosted due to its mediocre offensive stats. In addition to this, Z-Happy Hour can be rather risky and unreliable due to the fact it only works once throughout the game. Calm Mind Jirachi is vulnerable to fast revenge killers such as Landorus-T and does not immediately threaten teams. Jirachi can also be difficult to fit on teams, since it competes for a teamslot with Steel's many other offensive options such as Magnezone and Bisharp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Protect is an option on specially defensive Jirachi to get safe healing with Wish, stall opposing statused Pokemon, and scout for attacks; however, this takes up a moveslot that could be better used for a solid attacking option, entry hazards, or a slow pivoting move. Healing Wish is another utility option that can be used in order to fully heal a teammate, but it comes at the same opportunity cost as Protect + Wish.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used over Substitute to beat threats such as Gliscor and Landorus on a switch; however, not using Substitute makes Jirachi more susceptible to status such as from Suicune's Scald and from Chansey's Thunder Wave and revenge killers such as Mega Sharpedo and Greninja.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers: Pokemon that carry super effective STAB attacks such as Blacephalon, Heatran, Excadrill, and Mega Sharpedo can break past Jirachi with minimal effort.

At most, Jirachi can paralyze these Pokemon with Thunder Wave, but it's ultimately a fruitless effort.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Toxapex, Seismitoad, and Greninja generally don't mind taking hits from Jirachi and can cripple, OHKO, or 2HKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Specially defensive Jirachi can struggle with managing powerful physical threats such as Choice Band Tapu Bulu and Mega Heracross, as it generally does not take hits well from these Pokemon and is usually 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Walls such as Slowbro and Mega Venusaur generally don't care about anything that Jirachi does to them, although Slowbro does need to watch out for Toxic.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster revenge killers that carry super effective coverage such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon can reliably check Jirachi, though they usually require chip damage if Jirachi has boosted already.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Jirachi normally lacks the power to break past Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus-T, which can KO Jirachi in return.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Despite normally taking reduced damage from Knock Off, Jirachi cannot use its main STAB attack against Pokemon such as Dark Pulse Greninja and Hydreigon, both of which can reliably 2HKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Bisharp resist Jirachi's STAB attacks and can threaten it with their own STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Common defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Mew can usually check Jirachi by virtue of their bulk and typing.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Thunder Wave users such as Klefki can cripple Jirachi by halving its Speed and allowing a plethora of Pokemon to naturally outspeed it, limiting its sweeping capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers: Pokemon that can remove stat boosts pressure Jirachi.

        "name": "Specially Defensive (Psychic)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head is Jirachi's attack of choice, as it carries Steel-type STAB, has a doubled flinch rate thanks to Serene Grace, and is extremely spammable. Stealth Rock puts pressure on opposing teams, most notably Bug and Flying teams, while also breaking Focus Sashes and providing nice chip damage. Toxic is the better of Jirachi's two status options because of its ability to wear down opposing walls such as Mantine and Porygon2. Thunder Wave is another good status option that can be used to cut a foe's Speed in half, and when used with Iron Head, it can completely shut Pokemon down. U-turn is Jirachi's form of slow pivoting, which brings teammates in safely. Alternatively, Wish gives Jirachi recovery beyond Leftovers and allows it to become a decent check or counter to some major threats in the metagame such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in HP gives Jirachi the highest possible mixed bulk. 80 EVs are placed in Jirachi's Speed stat in order for it to reach 256 Speed, allowing it to outspeed fully invested Adamant Diggersby. The rest of the EVs go into Special Defense with a Careful nature to maximize Jirachi's special tanking potential. Serene Grace lets Jirachi make greater use of Iron Head by doubling its flinch rate. Leftovers rounds out the set as a form of passive recovery that allows Jirachi to pivot more freely by giving it greater longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jirachi can work as lead on Psychic, as it can put immediate pressure on the opposing team with Stealth Rock and status while also providing momentum quickly via a slow U-turn. This Jirachi set should be used as a switch-in to the many special attacks it is resistant or immune to. Jirachi can be used to tank physical attacks as well thanks to its maximum investment in HP and incredible defensive typing, but it will not be able to take these hits as easily. Take advantage of Jirachi's great utility options in setting up Stealth Rock, spreading status with Toxic or Thunder Wave, and healing itself and others via Wish support. Thanks to its Steel typing, access to Toxic and Thunder Wave, and ability to spam Iron Head, Jirachi can be used to shut down opposing walls and defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, and Staraptor with few to no drawbacks. Jirachi is Psychic's most valuable defensive check to Bug-type threats such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Scolipede, so keeping it healthy to successfully manage these Pokemon is vital. Jirachi is an amazing pivot for Psychic teams as well, using U-turn to bring momentum to its team's side by taking attacks for the Pokemon it's pivoting out to. If Jirachi has Wish, it can successfully combine it with Iron Head spamming as well as status moves to stall out opposing Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu; however, Wish also enables Jirachi to heal teammates. Be wary of Pokemon that may carry super effective attacks, especially physical ones, as moves like Knock Off and Earthquake can usually take Jirachi out quickly. Make sure to switch out to an appropriate teammate when faced with most physical attackers, as the lack of investment in Jirachi's Defense stat can leave it fairly vulnerable to Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slowbro is an amazing teammate for Jirachi, as it carries a resistance to one of Jirachi's weaknesses in Fire, can check Water-types more easily, and most importantly provides a switch-in to physical attackers that can work with Jirachi in a pivot core thanks to Regenerator. Mega Slowbro provides even better physically defensive support in exchange for the loss of Regenerator, which could end up being a good reason to run Wish on Jirachi. Victini is Psychic's best physical wallbreaker, checking common threats to Jirachi such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and providing an offensive check to Pokemon like Volcarona, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Choice Scarf Excadrill. It also acts as an offensive pivot thanks to U-turn, which can bring Jirachi in on threats to Victini such as Rock- and Water-types as well as on defensive and utility Pokemon like Porygon2 and Klefki. Latios is one of Psychic's best special wallbreakers and is a good offensive check to Pokemon that threaten Jirachi, namely Garchomp, Heatran, and Nidoking. It can also act as a switch-in to Fire- and Ground-type attacks and provide support in the form of Defog for removing entry hazards and can benefit greatly from Jirachi's status spreading, pivoting, and Wish passing. Mega Latios can break down annoying Steel-types that can wall Jirachi while also gaining great support via Jirachi's utility in U-turn, Wish, and Healing Wish. Focus Sash + Counter Alakazam can work well with Jirachi's slow pivoting as a check to physical sweepers. Jirachi can also keep Alakazam healthy via Wish. Mega Alakazam works as a powerful sweeper that can switch in safely thanks to Jirachi's U-turn and can easily take over the momentum of a match. Meloetta is Psychic's most solid check to Ghost-types because of its immunity to their STAB attacks. It can provide great support for Jirachi against Pokemon such as Blacephalon, Gengar, and Mimikyu and greatly appreciates Wish support due to its lack of recovery. Mew can act as either a stallbreaker that can help Jirachi spread status with Will-O-Wisp or as a scout that can also remove the items of opposing Pokemon with Knock Off. Stallbreaker Mew also appreciates Stealth Rock support from Jirachi, which frees up its own moveslots for more essential utility options in Defog and Taunt. Mewnium Z Mew can gain favorable matchups thanks to Jirachi's slow U-turn, which can also lead to an easy use of Rock Polish or Nasty Plot for a sweep. Mega Latias pairs well with Jirachi as a check to Fire- and Ground-type attacks while also being a potent threat as a setup sweeper. Jirachi is able to bring Mega Latias in safely and give it great support via Wish and Healing Wish. Mega Gallade is another excellent teammate that appreciates Jirachi's support immensely so that it can effectively break down defensive cores and find safe opportunities to set up a Swords Dance.</p> "

        "name": "Z-Happy Hour (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Happy Hour, when used with Normalium Z, gives Jirachi a one-time boost to all of its stats, making it very threatening due to its increased offenses and difficulty to revenge kill. Psychic is Jirachi's strongest move and allows it to blow past Poison- and Fighting-types such as Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, and Terrakion. Thunderbolt offers great coverage for Jirachi, allowing it to hit various Water- and Flying-types such as Mantine and Skarmory that would otherwise wall it. Iron Head is a secondary STAB move that is useful for its high flinch chance and ability to break past special walls such as Alolan Muk.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread alongside a Naive nature maximizes Jirachi's Special Attack and Speed without sacrificing its Attack stat or increasing the damage of Alolan Muk's Knock Off, allowing it to become a fearsome mixed sweeper in matchups like Poison. Serene Grace is Jirachi's only ability and doubles the secondary effect chance of all of its attacks, most notably giving Iron Head a 60% flinch chance. Normalium Z is required in order to use Z-Happy Hour and reduces the power of Knock Off, allowing Jirachi to have a better matchup against Alolan Muk and other Dark-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is generally used late-game, as Jirachi can become a fearsome sweeper once all of its counters and revenge killers have been weakened or KOed. It is imperative to only set up with Z-Happy Hour once its answers are KOed, however, as Jirachi will only have one chance throughout the game to do so. Setting up while a potential check like Infernape is still healthy can waste its one opportunity to sweep. Specifically, Jirachi appreciates Dark-types such as Bisharp being KOed before attempting to sweep, as they prohibit Jirachi from freely using Psychic. In matchups such as Poison and Flying, Jirachi can be crucial in order to deal with important threats like Mega Venusaur and Mantine, so it is important to not play recklessly with Jirachi in these matchups. With this in mind, it is not recommended to set up in front of Haze users such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Mantine, as they can eliminate Jirachi's only setup opportunity and leave it vulnerable for the remainder of the game. Additionally, avoid phazers such as Swampert, as they can also remove Jirachi's boosts. Try to avoid status altogether. Although it is immune to Toxic, Jirachi is still crippled by paralysis and dislikes the chip damage and reduction in Attack from getting burned. Use Jirachi's good typing and bulk to set up against more passive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is a crucial teammate for Jirachi and all Steel teams alike by providing an important Fire immunity and taking on opposing Steel-types and walls such as Ferrothorn thanks to its Fire-type STAB moves and access to Taunt. Entry hazard setters such as Skarmory and Excadrill are greatly appreciated in order to wear down switch-ins for Jirachi. Skarmory provides a Ground immunity and a defensive pivot for the team, while Excadrill is a more offensive setter that retains momentum for Jirachi. Celesteela is a similar Ground-immune option that can threaten more defensive Pokemon with its access to Leech Seed. Pokemon that can remove hazards such as the aforementioned Skarmory and Empoleon are also appreciated, as they can clear off problematic entry hazards such as Sticky Web and Spikes. Excadrill can also support Jirachi as a Choice Scarf user that can threaten many Pokemon that trouble Jirachi such as Chansey, while Jirachi can take out Pokemon such as Skarmory. Ferrothorn is an another hazard setter that can wear down many of Jirachi's checks, such as Porygon2, thanks to its access to Leech Seed. Its Grass typing also allowsit to check various Ground-types such as Hippowdon for Jirachi. Mega Scizor and Bisharp are setup Pokemon that benefit Jirachi thanks to how well they can take advantage of their typings to threaten Dark- and Psychic-types such as Greninja and Mew, which Jirachi normally struggles with. Mega Scizor can also give Jirachi opportunities to come in safely due to U-turn. Cobalion is a decent offensive teammate that can also offer support against various opposing Steel-types with its Fighting-type STAB moves and access to Volt Switch to generate momentum against switch-ins such as Celesteela. Lastly, Klefki provides dual screens support, which can help Jirachi set up on a wider range of Pokemon due to its increased bulk behind screens.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute allows Jirachi to safely set up against defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and makes it harder for opposing Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Greninja to revenge kill. It also protects Jirachi from status moves such as Leech Seed and Thunder Wave. Calm Mind allows Jirachi to hit hard and act as a bulky sweeper due to its already decent stats, making it harder to revenge kill. Psychic is used to beat Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, Nidoking, and Kommo-o, all of which are hard for Steel-type teams to beat. Psyshock may be used over Psychic to beat opposing Calm Mind users such as Suicune and get past dedicated special walls such as Chansey. Thunderbolt is useful for taking out Water- and Flying-types such as Mantine, Mega Sharpedo, and Celesteela that are not threatened by Psychic.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment increases Jirachi's overall bulk and aids it in setting up. It also allows Jirachi to create 101 HP Substitutes, which cannot be broken by a Seismic Toss from Chansey. 136 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used to outspeed Suicune, Nidoking, and Substitute Zapdos, allowing Jirachi to set up on or beat such Pokemon. The rest of the EVs are used in its Special Attack stat to make it hit harder. Leftovers gives Jirachi a form of passive recovery, allowing it to set up Calm Mind and Substitute more effectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Jirachi set works best mid- to late-game when some of its checks and counters such as Swampert, Alolan Muk, and Gliscor are weakened or taken out by its teammates. At this point, Jirachi can attempt to set up on passive Pokemon that cannot threaten it such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Mega Venusaur. Jirachi can also set up a Substitute on a forced switch against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. Status such as Scald burns or paralysis should be avoided, as the former negates Leftovers recovery, and the latter makes Jirachi unable to act as an effective sweeper. Jirachi can set up a Substitute against defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela to safeguard itself from status moves such as Leech Seed and set up Calm Mind freely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is a great teammate, as it not only provides Jirachi with a Fire-type immunity to take care of threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona but can also provide utility support in the form of Stealth Rock. In return, Jirachi takes care of Water- and Poison-types that Heatran struggles to beat like Mantine and Nidoking. Choice Scarf Excadrill can check Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora for Jirachi. Thanks to its ability Mold Breaker, Excadrill can cripple threats to Jirachi like Mega Sableye with Toxic and help to wear down its checks. Using Leech Seed and Toxic, Celesteela can weaken defensive cores for Jirachi, take care of threats like Mega Gallade for it, and provide a crucial Ground-type immunity. Celesteela can also utilize an Assault Vest set to beat Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Excadrill that threaten Jirachi. Ferrothorn provides a resistance to Water and can take on Pokemon like Manaphy for Jirachi. It can additionally set up Spikes and Leech Seed to wear down opposing teams as well as beat Ground-types like Swampert and Gastrodon with Power Whip. Choice Scarf Magnezone can beat threats like Keldeo and provide Volt Switch support for Jirachi. It can check Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus with Hidden Power Ice as well. Lucario can beat Dark- and Steel-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Heatran that Jirachi struggles to beat. Mega Scizor appreciates Jirachi taking care of bulky Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex and Mantine, which Mega Scizor struggles to break past. In return, Mega Scizor can act as a secondary wincon and deal with Psychic- and Dark-types such as Mega Gallade and Alolan Muk that Jirachi struggles against. Bisharp can wallbreak teams for Jirachi and beat Psychic-type Pokemon like Victini.</p> "

  "Deoxys-Speed": {
    "overview": "<p>An incredible Speed stat allows Deoxys-S to outspeed the entire metagame, letting it move first with its support movepool or serve as a threatening Nasty Plot sweeper using its good coverage options. Excellent support options such as Taunt, Spikes, Stealth Rock, Light Screen, and Reflect allow Deoxys-S to support its team and function as the top entry hazard lead for hyper offensive builds. Its passable bulk even allows Deoxys-S to often get off a second move, especially when combined with dual screens.However, Lead Deoxys-S is only really usable on hyper offensive builds, which limits the number of teams it can fit on, and a pure Psychic typing means it doesn't bring any new resistances or neutralities. Lead Deoxys-S also has a few hard counters, such as Mega Sableye and Rapid Spin users, that render it mostly useless. Alternatively, Deoxys-S's access to Nasty Plot combined with great coverage moves in Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Energy Ball also allows it to serve as a threatening setup sweeper that can pose a huge threat to Water, Flying, Electric, and Ground. Its amazing Speed allows it to outspeed various offensive threats such as Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Greninja, making its offensive checks hard to find. However, as a setup sweeper, its bulk is rather poor, meaning it is easily checked by priority users such as Dragonite as well as faster Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain, Excadrill under sand, Mega Swampert under rain, and the fastest Choice Scarf users such as Latios and Greninja. In addition to that, Deoxys-S's Special Attack is rather lacking, meaning it usually has to rely on boosting with Nasty Plot to deal significant damage, especially against bulkier Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet may be used to punish Rapid Spin users such as Armaldo on Entry Hazard Lead Deoxys-S, but it isn't generally worth the lack of Focus Sash on Spikes sets and is crippling to screen sets. Skill Swap is an option to bypass Mega Sableye on Entry Hazard Lead Deoxys-S, but it doesn't do so particularly well and the Dark and Ghost matchups are mostly unwinnable regardless. Life Orb boosts all of Nasty Plot Deoxys-S's attacks on Nasty Plot Deoxys-S, which is most notably useful for OHKOing many frailer Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zeraora, Mega Diancie, and Tornadus-T with Psycho Boost. However, the recoil wears it down considerably and puts it into range for revenge killers and priority users to pick it off more easily, which is particularly notable for Choice Band Dragonite, which beats it with Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock and one turn of Life Orb recoil.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: With Magic Bounce, Mega Sableye can reflect Taunt, Spikes, and Stealth Rock, preventing Deoxys-S from doing anything but set up screens. Furthermore, both Mega Sableye and either of its teams have a great matchup versus the rest of Psychic, preventing any easy counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Rapid Spin cannot be prevented by Taunt, allowing any users to freely remove Deoxys-S's entry hazards, particularly as Psychic has no viable spinblocker. While they are relatively rare and cannot interfere with screens, they greatly reduce Deoxys-S's effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Shuckle</strong>: Thanks to Mental Herb and Encore, Shuckle can cripple Deoxys-S. Should Deoxys-S use Taunt, Shuckle places Deoxys-S in a favorable 50 / 50 between a free switch and free entry hazards, while using any other support move lets Shuckle lock Deoxys-S into that and proceed to set its own entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Jirachi, and Alolan Muk all deal with Nasty Plot Deoxys-S pretty comfortably, as they can take any of its attacks and set up hazards, cripple it with status, or Pursuit trap it in return.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority Users: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja, Choice Scarf Latios, and Alolan Raichu all outspeed and beat Deoxys-S comfortably due to its poor bulk. Priority users such as Bisharp, Dragonite, and Mimikyu can also pick it off with ease.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: When paralyzed, Deoxys-S is vulnerable to being revenge killed by slower threats like Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Diancie.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Entry Hazard Lead",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Taunt blocks status moves, preventing the foe from setting up, using Taunt, laying entry hazards, and using Defog. Stealth Rock is the primary entry hazard, as it hits every type and greatly aids in the matchup versus Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-type teams. Light Screen halves the power of opposing special attacks, giving free setup opportunities to Deoxys-S’s teammates and the ability to survive attacks versus most special attackers, and Reflect rounds out the moveset, performing the same role with physical attacks. Knock Off is another option over screens to cripple the opposing team by removing items and giving Deoxys-S a small form of offensive presence against frail foes. Spikes is a secondary entry hazard that can be run alongside Knock Off that further punishes switching.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Deoxys-S’s Speed, allowing it to Speed tie with opposing Deoxys-S and outpace anything slower; if Knock Off is used, a Jolly nature should instead be run. 248 HP EVs increase Deoxys-S’s bulk while hitting a passive damage number, allowing it to live an extra round of burn, weather, and poison damage. Pressure is Deoxys-S’s only ability and allows it to better wear down the PP of Defog, ensuring its entry hazards aren't removed. 8 Special Defense EVs ensure Download gives Porygon-Z an Attack boost. Light Clay increases the length of Light Screen and Reflect, allowing for longer protection, but if neither screen is run Focus Sash all but ensures Deoxys-S can get off an attack or entry hazard on the second turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Deoxys-S should almost always lead in order to set up entry hazards as quickly as possible. Use the respective screen against offensive Pokemon to allow Deoxys-S to take their attacks. Taunt should be used to block harmful status moves such as setup moves, Defog, and entry hazards, but in many cases, the threat of Taunt is enough. If running Knock Off, only use it versus highly item-reliant Pokemon such as Chansey and Choice Scarf Victini to prevent them from doing their job later; in most other cases, it is better to set an extra layer of entry hazards or screens. Should the opponent have a Mega Sableye, either lead with a different Pokemon or restrict Deoxys-S to setting screens; the same goes for Rapid Spin users, albeit to a lesser extent. Deoxys-S does not have to function solely as a suicide lead; its solid bulk, particularly when combined with screens, means it may often be used multiple times in a match. However, it's often useful to sacrifice Deoxys-S in order to get another Pokemon in for free with entry hazards up; it can use Taunt and screens to stop setup sweepers. Be wary of being too obvious in the use of Taunt, as most Pokemon can instead use that turn to attack and heavily injure Deoxys-S.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mew is an excellent teammate for Deoxys-S, as Light Screen and Reflect give Mewnium Z sets numerous opportunities to use Nasty Plot and Rock Polish, while Mew's offensive pressure means that it's difficult for most foes to use Defog; the stallbreaker set, meanwhile, can use Taunt to block Defog and appreciates the use of entry hazards to punish switching. Victini appreciates the entry hazard support to wear down switch-ins, particularly alongside U-turn, and it enjoys the fact that Deoxys-S can prevent the foe from setting up Stealth Rock with Taunt. Alakazam appreciates entry hazard support so that foes cannot freely switch when avoiding Counter; it also doesn't mind the dearth of hazard removal that hazard stacking causes. Meloetta handles Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gengar and Mega Sableye and appreciates Stealth Rock to reliably 2HKO Chansey. Gardevoir threatens to OHKO Mega Sableye, forcing it out, and greatly turns around the corresponding Dark matchup; in other games, Gardevoir appreciates entry hazard support making it harder to switch for its revenge killing. Latios makes great use of entry hazards, as they allow it to wear down answers such as Mantine and prevent them from switching in readily.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot turns Deoxys-S into a threatening setup sweeper and allows it to break bulkier Pokemon such as Celesteela, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Celesteela for super effective damage. Ice Beam hits Flying-type Pokemon that are not weak to Thunderbolt such as Gliscor, Zapdos, and Landorus-T for super effective damage, working together with Thunderbolt to beat defensive Flying cores effectively. Ice Beam can also hit Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Latios. Energy Ball hits super effectively, which combines with Thunderbolt and Ice Beam to take down Water and Ground teams, respectively. Psycho Boost is an option over Energy Ball as an extremely strong STAB attack that does not need a boost to threaten more offensive Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora while also beating Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. It also hits Kyurem-B and can take down Dragon teams in conjunction with Ice Beam. With Shattered Psyche, Deoxys-S can beat most of Energy Ball's targets anyway.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Electrium Z can be used for Gigavolt Havoc, which is especially good for beating specially defensive Celesteela after a Nasty Plot boost. It can also OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Charizard Y unboosted. Psychium Z is another option to enable Shattered Psyche for when Deoxys-S cannot find time to boost, and it is required to make using Psycho Boost reliable. If there is another Z-Move user on the team, Expert Belt is an option to take advantage of Deoxys-S's super effective coverage by notably allowing Deoxys-S to OHKO physically defensive Celesteela after a boost and Greninja unboosted. Maximum investment in Special Attack allows Deoxys-S to be as strong as possible. Maximum investment into Speed along with a Timid nature allows Deoxys-S to be as fast as possible, outspeeding common slower offensive threats such as Tapu Koko, Zeraora,  and Greninja, as well as certain Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Nihilego, and Hydreigon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Deoxys-S should generally try to sweep or deal significant damage in matchups it excels in such as Water and Flying using Nasty Plot and its amazing Speed and coverage. However, in other matchups such as Steel, Dark, and Fairy where Deoxys-S struggles to sweep, it should try to serve as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker so that its other teammates can sweep. Since its bulk is lackluster, Deoxys-S should avoid switching into stronger attacks such as Tornadus-T's Hurricane and Swampert's Earthquake, as they will oftentimes leave it too weak to set up effectively and prone to getting revenge killed easily. For example, in the Flying matchup, taking minor chip damage while setting up can easily lead to being revenge killed by Dragonite's Extreme Speed. In the matchups where Deoxys-S excels, it should try to set up against defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Mantine or on forced switches against Pokemon such as Greninja, Garchomp, and Pelipper. However, be careful when setting up against offensive Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Tornadus-T in the Flying matchup, as they're often required to stay in to prevent their entire team from getting swept after a free Nasty Plot. Setting up Stealth Rock is largely beneficial for Deoxys-S as a sweeper and revenge killer, as it is great for breaking Dragonite's Multiscale, breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon like Breloom, and chipping away at Pokemon like Celesteela, Mega Charizard Y, and Zapdos. It is especially good in the Flying matchup, as setting up Stealth Rock means Deoxys-S doesn't need to use Nasty Plot to sweep, as the Stealth Rock damage covers up its rather lackluster unboosted Special Attack. Due to its high Speed, Deoxys-S can also be used as a lead in order to grab good matchups against opposing leads such as Tapu Koko, Swampert and Mega Diancie. Its amazing Speed stat also allows it to function as a great revenge killer that is able to revenge kill common offensive threats like Greninja, Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora. Try to remove entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, before sending Deoxys-S in to sweep. Removing Toxic Spikes is especially important in the Water matchup, where Deoxys-S excels, because it will need to frequently swap between its coverage moves in order to effectively dismantle the opposition. Be careful around status inducers such as Rotom-W and Zapdos that can threaten to paralyze or badly poison Deoxys-S. The former lowers its Speed and the latter wears it down over time, both making Deoxys-S easier to revenge kill and check.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Victini and Mega Gallade are both amazing physical wallbreakers that support Deoxys-S. They can both break down Steel- and Dark-types as well as specially bulky Pokemon such as Jirachi, Ferrothorn, Mega Sableye, Alolan Muk, and Chansey, eliminating a majority of Deoxys-S's defensive checks. Mega Gallade can also pick off Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Choice Scarf Latios with Shadow Sneak for Deoxys-S. In return, Deoxys-S is able to threaten faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora that Victini and Mega Gallade struggle against. As a setup sweeper with lackluster bulk, Deoxys-S appreciates Healing Wish users such as Latias and Celebi, as they can heal it if it ever gets worn down or inflicted with status. Choice Scarf Latias can beat revenge killers such as +1 Mega Sharpedo and Choice Scarf Terrakion for Deoxys-S. Latios is another more powerful Choice Scarf user that can beat the aforementioned Pokemon, or it can serve as a formidable wallbreaker using its higher Special Attack in order to beat shared checks like Celesteela for Deoxys-S. Latias's and Latios's access to Defog is crucial because they can remove Toxic Spikes, Spikes, and Stealth Rock, which chip at Deoxys-S's health, as well as Sticky Web, which slows it down. Jirachi and Celebi can both support Deoxys-S with Stealth Rock, which helps Deoxys-S wear down the opposing team by forcing switches. They can also pivot into strong attacks that threaten Deoxys-S, such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Mega Swampert's Waterfall, and bring it in with U-turn. With a Colbur Berry, they can both serve as good checks to Mega Sharpedo, which can revenge kill Deoxys-S at +1. Metagross is an offensive Stealth Rock setter that can trap Pokemon that check Deoxys-S such as Alolan Raichu and Latios with Pursuit as well as serving as a good Mimikyu check with Kasib Berry. It's also great in the Fairy matchup where Deoxys-S struggles to sweep, especially if it is not running Psycho Boost. Mew's access to Taunt is great for denying hazards that chip away at Deoxys-S's health from Pokemon such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Swampert. As a stallbreaker, Mew can take on many walls like Chansey, Alolan Muk, and Ferrothorn and remove Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Latios and Greninja, paving the way for Deoxys-S to clean. Its stallbreaking capabilities allow Mew to take on matchups that Deoxys-S struggles in such as Steel and Normal very well. Alakazam is a good partner for Deoxys-S because it can blanket check physical attackers like Mega Sharpedo, Excadrill, and Bisharp.</p> "

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Infernape is Fighting's premier suicide lead, able to get up Stealth Rock effectively before going down, often either crippling or taking out a foe on the way. Thanks to its Fire typing, Infernape can be a huge help against Steel teams, which are surprisingly annoying to deal with at times. A combination of Fire Blast and Close Combat can at least 2HKO entire Steel teams. Thanks to its access to Taunt and its good Speed, Infernape can at least tie with Galvantula, which gives it a chance to Taunt it before Sticky Web can be set to cripple the team, as Fighting teams lack reliable entry hazard removal. With access to Endeavor and priority, Infernape can effectively trade at worst one-for-one in most circumstances, which solidifies its niche on the team as a very reliable suicide lead instead of a Steel counter. Unfortunately, Infernape faces competition from Cobalion, which is a far more reliable Stealth Rock setter in most cases for Fighting teams, as it brings better bulk and a Steel typing that makes it a switch-in for Psychic-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks. In contrast, Infernape's Fire typing is almost never useful defensively, as even if it can take one Fairy-type attack, it has no way to hit back hard. Infernape also has little use outside of being a lead, as its poor bulk is irredeemable and even its offensive stats are rather unimpressive.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Infernape's fantastic Speed tier and high-Base Power STAB moves allow it to excel as a revenge killer when equipped with a Choice Scarf, notably revenge killing big threats to Fire teams in Terrakion and Choice Scarf Nihilego. Infernape can also perform well as a wallbreaker with a Choice Band, thanks to its expansive physical movepool, which allows it to nail typical Fire-type switch-ins like Toxapex and Mantine with super effective coverage. Its typing is also quite helpful, allowing Infernape to ease Fire's matchup against Rock, Dark, and Normal teams, alongside giving it a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, Infernape is hampered by its pitiful defenses, which, in tandem with its weaknesses to common attacking types like Water and Ground, prevent it from defensively providing for Fire at all. Infernape can also struggle to break past Pokemon that often prove troublesome to Fire, such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, and Dragonite, and it thus needs to be played with caution. Its general reliance on Choice items can also hinder it, since being locked into a move makes it easy to be countered. Lastly, Infernape's Speed, while not bad, still leaves it outsped and heavily threatened by common threats in Greninja, Latios, and Choice Scarf Excadrill if it isn't holding a Choice Scarf itself.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p>If Stealth Rock utility is already covered by a teammate, Infernape is one of the few Fighting-types that can run a mixed all-out attacker set, but it tends to be less effective than the other potential attackers that a hyper offensive type like Fighting can field like Kommo-o.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Infernape can attempt sweeping with either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, given its good mixed offensive stats, high Speed, and diverse movepool. However, Swords Dance sets are more or less outclassed by Mega Charizard X due to its higher Attack and ability to boost Speed, while Nasty Plot sets face heavy competition from Volcarona, which is also more powerful and covers more of the metagame with its coverage. A suicide lead set with Focus Sash that looks to set up Stealth Rock can be used, but it is generally not preferred due to the existence of more reliable entry hazard setters in Torkoal and Heatran and due to Infernape's much better consistency as a Choice Scarf or Choice Band attacker. A mixed attacking set with Life Orb is also an option, thanks to Infernape's good movepool and offensive stats, though it will often be worn down quite easily due to Life Orb recoil and won't compare to its listed sets in terms of power. Lastly, Thunder Punch is an option on either set for nailing most Water-type switch-ins, but this usually gives up the better coverage provided by either Stone Edge or Earthquake or the ability to pick off weakened threats with Mach Punch.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Anti-leads: Infernape can be rendered useless by most anti-leads, as it is as generic of a lead as there is. Pokemon with Magic Bounce such as Mega Diancie and faster Taunt users such as Aerodactyl can completely prevent Infernape from properly doing its job.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster Pokemon can force Endeavor Infernape to choose between setting Stealth Rock and using Endeavor. Sets without Endeavor are even more vulnerable, as they will be unable to do anything but set Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Hippowdon</strong>: Hippowdon is a great check to Infernape, as Sand Stream always breaks Infernape's Focus Sash safely. In addition to this, Hippowdon also forces a 50/50, as it can Earthquake to KO Infernape after sand damage or set up its own Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Rapid Spin can break Infernape's Focus Sash and remove Stealth Rock at the same time, making Torkoal and Armaldo reasonable answers to Infernape.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Mantine and Toxapex are good defensive counters to Infernape by virtue of their typing. While they cannot stop Stealth Rock from being set, they aren't threatened by Infernape in any other way and can force it out easily.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: If Infernape uses the Endeavor set, Ghost-types completely wall it, although most of them will not be able to prevent Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Mantine, and Mega Slowbro may fear super effective coverage, but more often than not they will tank Infernape's attacks and threaten to wear it down with STAB Scald. Offensive Water-types like Manaphy, Keldeo, and Gyarados are also quite threatening to Infernape due to their ability to take a Close Combat and retaliate with powerful STAB moves, though all must be wary of super effective coverage. Azumarill and Tapu Fini are two particularly troublesome Water-types for Infernape to deal with, as their additional Fairy typing gives them resistances to Close Combat and U-turn, while both can also usually shrug off Earthquake or Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types like Landorus-T, Dragonite, Zapdos, and Togekiss can tank a hit and in return KO Infernape with their powerful STAB attacks. Some, however, should be wary of Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types can come in on Infernape's Fighting-type attacks and proceed to either set up or threaten it out with super effective STAB attacks. Examples include Latios, which is particularly troublesome due to its Dragon typing providing a Fire resistance, and Mew, which can use Infernape as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Unless it's holding a Choice Scarf, Infernape is outsped and heavily threatened by common threats such as Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, Dugtrio, and Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain. Even when holding a Choice Scarf, it is still threatened by faster users of the item, such as Greninja, Latios, and Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie: Mega Diancie is capable of taking any attack from Choice Scarf Infernape, including Earthquake, and OHKOing it in return with a powerful STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: The combination of Flare Blitz recoil, entry hazard damage, and potentially poison damage can whittle Infernape down extremely quickly, which makes it easier to pick off with priority or faster Choice Scarf users.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis from moves like Thunder Wave and Stun Spore will often cripple Infernape, as its lowered Speed will either keep it from sufficiently revenge killing with Choice Scarf or from outspeeding and offensively pressuring foes with Choice Band.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock and Taunt are Infernape's core moves, allowing it to both set up entry hazards and prevent the opponent's hazards, giving the team an advantage from the beginning. Taunt is especially important for the Bug matchup, as if Infernape wins the Speed tie, it can prevent Galvantula from setting up the all-important Sticky Web that allows Mega Pinsir to rip through Fighting teams. It also helps against Flying, where Infernape outspeeds most common Defoggers. Fire Blast and Close Combat give Infernape offensive presence, as they are its strongest moves and give it mixed capabilities, being especially dangerous for Steel teams to handle. Alternatively, Endeavor can be used with Vacuum Wave to cripple and then KO one Pokemon if not two after Infernape has set Stealth Rock. However, Infernape will have little to no use outside of as a lead with this set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread maximizes Infernape's damage output and Speed, making it as effective of a lead as possible. The Naive nature reduces damage taken from priority moves while making sure Infernape can Speed tie with Galvantula. Focus Sash makes Infernape a reliable lead that can at least get up Stealth Rock and still either Taunt or fire off an attack after. Blaze is the only useful ability for this set, as once Infernape is knocked down to 1 HP, its Fire Blast can deal even more damage. If Infernape uses Endeavor, it should use 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense, to get down to 1 HP as easily as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Infernape should be used as a lead in almost every scenario, as it doesn't have much use late-game. Be careful of anti-leads, though, and save Infernape for later if it would be matched against a faster Taunt user such as Aerodactyl or a Magic Bounce user like Mega Sableye. Because Fighting teams lack entry hazard removal, Infernape should usually prioritize Taunting opposing leads over getting up its own Stealth Rock. However, in matchups like Flying where Stealth Rock is most important, Stealth Rock should be set and kept up at all costs. Most of the time, Infernape should just attack until it gets KOed after it fulfills its role to give a teammate a free switch in. Against more defensive Pokemon like Mantine, Infernape should try to use Taunt the turn it is KOed, to support its teammates as much as possible. For example, against Steel teams, Infernape should typically spam its super effective STAB attacks, as very few Steel-types can switch into it. It is worth saving Infernape for later too, when it is threatened by a revenge killer, as it is important for this matchup. For Endeavor sets, usually Infernape should set Stealth Rock the turn it's being brought down to its Focus Sash, which can be followed with Endeavor afterwards to cripple almost any slower foe. Against certain types like Flying and Bug that are especially weak to Stealth Rock, however, preserving Infernape may be necessary to make sure it can set entry hazards multiple times throughout the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers like Kommo-o appreciate Infernape's Stealth Rock making it easier for them to sweep late-game. In addition, Pokemon like Mega Gallade can benefit from the foe being Taunted as Infernape goes down, possibly giving them a free turn to set up. Other late-game cleaners like Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Heracross that gain an Attack boost with every KO have a much better chance of pulling off a full sweep after Stealth Rock has been slowly wearing down the opposing team. Focus Sash users such as Breloom and Terrakion require Taunt's utility, as most Fighting teams have no other partially reliable way of preventing opposing entry hazards, so Infernape is often a good teammate for them. Against Bug teams, Choice Scarf Terrakion is typically an important revenge killer that can outspeed Choice Scarf Heracross and +1 Volcarona. Infernape's ability to Taunt Galvantula if it wins a Speed tie and prevent Sticky Web from slowing Terrakion down is essential for making sure it can continue to check those fast threats. Wallbreakers like Keldeo appreciate Stealth Rock helping net easier KOs; for example, Flying teams struggle to deal with Keldeo's powerful super effective attacks when Stealth Rock punishes every switch to a check.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band (Fire)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz is Infernape's most powerful physical Fire-type STAB move, hitting most foes that don't resist it for impressive damage. Close Combat hits typical Fire-type switch-ins, such as Heatran, Swampert, and Garchomp, for impressive damage, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter two after Stealth Rock. U-turn pivots Infernape out of unfavorable matchups and adequately dents some of its switch-ins, most notably Latios and Slowbro. Mach Punch is powerful priority when boosted by Iron Fist, being able to aid Infernape in picking off weakened threats, such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Mega Sharpedo. Stone Edge can be used over Mach Punch, as it provides valuable coverage against bulky Flying-types like Zapdos and Mantine. Earthquake is also an option for hitting bulky Poison-types like Toxapex and Nidoking quite hard.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack gives Infernape considerable power, which is boosted to extremely impressive levels with a Choice Band. Full investment in Speed with a Jolly nature allows Infernape to outpace a good portion of the metagame, including common threats in Manaphy, Garchomp, and unboosted Volcarona. Iron Fist is the preferred ability, as it boosts the power of Mach Punch. However, if Infernape opts to run a different move in its fourth slot, Blaze is the better pick for increasing Flare Blitz's power once Infernape is low on health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set should be used with the intention of breaking past the opposing team's walls in order to pave way for a teammate's sweep. U-turn should be used as much as possible early-game, as this will allow Infernape to whittle down the opposing team and frequently generate momentum. Mach Punch should be utilized against weakened threats like Mega Sharpedo and Greninja, as they will be easily picked off and kept from further threatening Infernape's team. This set must use proper prediction in order to be used to as much success as possible. If Infernape is running Stone Edge or Earthquake, and a foe that takes super effective damage from these attacks, such as Mantine or Toxapex, is predicted to switch in, Infernape should use its super effective coverage to deal heavy damage to these Pokemon. Lastly, Infernape should be wary of faster threats when utilizing this set, due to its subpar bulk and lesser Speed than the Choice Scarf set. Even Pokemon that Infernape Speed ties with, like Keldeo and Terrakion, should be looked out for due to their ability to OHKO it if they win the tie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a key partner for this set, as it is able to revenge kill Nihilego and other threats, enabling Infernape to take on a wallbreaker role instead. Setup sweepers like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X make good teammates, since they appreciate Infernape's ability to weaken opposing teams and give them an easier time sweeping. Pokemon that have trouble dealing with specially defensive Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Blissey, such as Volcanion and Heatran, also make good teammates due to Infernape's ability to adequately pressure their checks. These two also have good uses themselves, as Volcanion provides a switch-in to Water-type attacks while Heatran can easily take on Nihilego, which Infernape has more trouble doing with this set. Stealth Rock setters like Torkoal and Heatran allow Infernape to break past foes more easily, while also punishing switch-ins. Rotom-H can set up Reflect and Light Screen for Infernape to alleviate its poor defenses, while also forming a potent VoltTurn core with it and bringing it into play safely. Drought users like Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y can help power up Infernape's Flare Blitz, which becomes devastatingly powerful under sun. Torkoal and Rotom-H are both even more useful due to their access to entry hazard removal. Pokemon capable of pressuring bulky Water-types, like Rotom-H, Mega Charizard Y, and Victini, which can use a Choice Scarf to keep faster foes in check that Infernape loses to with this set, can help circumvent Infernape's weakness to Pokemon like Azumarill and Tapu Fini.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf (Fire)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB attack that Infernape can use to revenge kill various boosted sweepers, such as Magearna, Bisharp, and Mimikyu. Close Combat provides excellent coverage alongside Flare Blitz, allowing Infernape to hit Rock-types like Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Omastar super effectively while also doing heavy damage to others, like Mega Aerodactyl and Nihilego. It also nails Heatran, which is immune to Flare Blitz due to Flash Fire, and Normal-types like Porygon2. U-turn is a good move for Infernape to use when predicting switches to Pokemon that can check it, such as Latios and Tapu Fini, and is useful for generating momentum. Stone Edge can be used to adequately revenge kill Flying and Fire-types, including Zapdos, Dragonite, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X. Earthquake is an option over Stone Edge that is useful for OHKOing Nihilego 100% of the time while also doing heavy damage to Electric-types like Xurkitree and Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack is important for maximizing Infernape's offensive presence even with a neutral nature. Maximum investment in Speed is also quite important, as with a Choice Scarf, it gives Infernape the ability to outrun the entire unboosted metagame and function as a reliable revenge killer. Blaze is the preferred ability, as it has situational use in that it can increase Flare Blitz's power when Infernape is at low health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's best function is as a revenge killer, which means that it should be used after a teammate has been sacrificed to dispose of threats like Tapu Bulu, Bisharp, Porygon-Z, and Nihilego. However, due to Infernape's poor damage output, it is important to make sure this set isn't being used to take care of defensive threats. Due to the nature of Choice Scarf, it is important to carefully predict while using Infernape. For example, if Infernape is predicting the switch to a Pokemon that walls it, such as Suicune or Slowbro, it is best to pivot out of play with U-turn to avoid losing momentum. The same can be said with hitting various switch-ins hard with super effective coverage, such as Toxapex with Earthquake and Mantine with Stone Edge. Unnecessary residual damage from entry hazards and poison should be avoided, as they will keep Infernape from putting either Choice Scarf or Flare Blitz to full use. Paralysis is also important to avoid, since Infernape's revenge killing capabilities will be compromised if its Speed is lowered. When using this set, Defense and Special Defense drops from Close Combat are also something to be wary about, as they can leave Infernape even more susceptible to priority or faster attackers. Infernape can attempt using this set to clean up late-game. However, it is important that all of its checks are either removed or heavily weakened if it does try to clean up, due to the drawbacks of its STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers that appreciate the removal of sweepers that heavily pressure them, such as Choice Band Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcanion, which is particularly useful for its Water-type immunity, enjoy having Infernape as a teammate due to its revenge killing capabilities. Setup sweepers like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X also appreciate Infernape as a teammate, as it can pave way for them by taking out opposing sweepers. Blacephalon can take on multiple roles either as a Calm Mind sweeper or as a wallbreaker that appreciates having switches in from U-turn and can break many of the physical walls that check Infernape. Pokemon that can switch into or pressure Water-types, such as Volcanion, Mega Charizard Y, and Victini, are often useful to Infernape as teammates. Infernape also likes being paired with Pokemon that can cover its Flying-type weakness, which makes Rotom-H and Heatran good options as teammates. Entry hazard support from the likes of Torkoal and Heatran can aid Infernape in punishing switch-ins and breaking past foes more reliably. Torkoal can also remove entry hazards to prevent Infernape from taking residual damage, and Heatran can also help deal with Mega Diancie and Nihilego, which takes some weight off of Infernape's shoulders. Rotom-H can form a VoltTurn core with Infernape as well as bring it into play safely with slow pivoting. It also provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks, which is crucial for both Infernape and its other teammates. Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y's Drought can power up Infernape's Flare Blitz, which can be potentially useful late-game. Either Torkoal or Rotom-H is essential to prevent hazards like Toxic Spikes from crippling Infernape over time. Lastly, with Extreme Speed, Choice Band Entei can finish off Pokemon that Infernape may not be able to late-game, such as Mega Diancie and Choice Scarf Nihilego, assuming they survive Close Combat.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Empoleon's good bulk allows it to fulfill the niche of a Stealth Rock setter and Defogger at the same time. Utility in Knock Off and Roar lets it cripple Pokemon like Chansey and phaze Pokemon like Suicune. Its amazing defensive typing gives it a resistance to ten types, an immunity to Poison-type attacks, and an important neutrality to Grass-type attacks. Although Empoleon has an amazing typing, the weakness to Ground-type attacks doesn't do it any favors, since it heavily stacks the weakness to Ground- and Electric-type moves with other balance staples like Toxapex. A lack of recovery outside of Leftovers weakens Empoleon's ability to provide Defog and Stealth Rock support and hinders its opportunity to check massive threats like Mega Diancie because it gets worn down so quickly. Empoleon also has lackluster Defense, so Pokemon like Tapu Bulu take advantage of it easily and it gets chipped at quickly by even weak physical attacks. A bad Speed stat and lackluster offensive stats make it very passive and exploitable. Stallbreakers like Mew and Gliscor take advantage of Empoleon's passive nature, preventing it from doing anything worthwhile thanks to their fast Taunt. Empoleon also has huge competition from other Pokemon like Swampert and Mantine. Swampert provides the same Stealth Rock support while also having an immunity to Electric-type attacks, which lets it check massive threats like Tapu Koko and Magnezone. On the other hand, Mantine offers much more reliable Defog support thanks to its superior bulk and access to Roost. It also provides a very important immunity to Ground-type attacks while still being neutral to Grass-type attacks like Empoleon.</p> ",

Defog supports teammates like Gastrodon and Azumarill that are vulnerable to entry hazards like Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock. Scald prevents Empoleon from being Taunt bait and helps it beat Pokemon like Mega Diancie. It also threatens physical attackers like Tapu Bulu with a potential burn. Roar lets Empoleon phaze Pokemon like Suicune and Mega Latias and rack up Stealth Rock chip damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers gives Empoleon a form of passive recovery.

Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs along with a Calm Nature maximize Empoleon's special bulk, which lets it take on Pokemon like Latios more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Prioritize setting up Stealth Rock early-game, especially against types like Fire and Bug. Similarly, against types like Flying and Fire, don't worry about using Defog to clear entry hazards. Instead, make sure Empoleon gets Stealth Rock up, as it is really important to chip down big threats like Zapdos and Mega Pinsir. Preserve Empoleon when you know you'll need it later on for threatening Pokemon like Mega Diancie. If Stealth Rock is up, use Roar liberally against types like Dragon and Flying that struggle with it, as it racks up chip damage quickly. Use Scald liberally to potentially burn physical threats like Tapu Bulu on the switch. Take care of setup sweepers like Suicune and Mega Latias by phazing them with Roar. Don’t waste Empoleon’s potential to check a big threat later in the game by trying to chip down opposing walls like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela. Similarly, avoid chip damage, as it wears down Empoleon quickly. Leftovers is Empoleon’s only form of recovery, so don’t recklessly switch it into attacks.

  "Staraptor": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Staraptor is one of the greatest assets to Normal teams, providing multiple roles as a defensive pivot and entry hazard remover. Staraptor's Flying typing allows it to take on Bug-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Grass-types effectively, and its physical bulk coupled with Intimidate makes it viable as an excellent Defogger. Staraptor has a decent movepool, with a great pivoting move in U-turn, utility in Roost and Defog. Staraptor's weakness to Stealth Rock makes it difficult to find opportunities to switch in and use Defog, and its physical bulk is not great; it's only a good switch-in to physical attackers because of Intimidate. Staraptor's Special Defense is mediocre and doesn't let it take multiple hits from threats such as Landorus. Furthermore, Staraptor's reliance on Brave Bird as its STAB move wears it down very easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Close Combat hits Steel-types such as Bisharp, which would otherwise be difficult for Normal teams to deal with after a Swords Dance boost. A Choice Band set with an Adamant nature can be used with Reckless, as it not only maximizes Staraptor's damage output but also Brave Bird and Double-Edge's power, making Staraptor a great wallbreaker; however, Staraptor prefers to run Defog to remove entry hazards and prolong its presence in battle with Roost. Choice Scarf allows Staraptor to revenge kill faster threats such as unboosted Greninja and Latios. Unfortunately, Choice Scarf is not as useful compared to its defensive set. Rocky Helmet can punish physical attackers upon contact, but Leftovers is more reliable for giving Staraptor recovery. Toxic can be used to put a timer on walls, making it easier to wear them down; however, Chansey and Porygon2 fit that role much better, and it wastes a moveslot for something better that Staraptor can use. Running 108 Speed EVs is an option in order to outspeed Jolly Breloom.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Mega Slowbro can easily tank Staraptor's attacks and recover any damage they take.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Due to Staraptor's subpar special bulk, special attackers such as Landorus and Nihilego can easily pressure and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Celesteela, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor can give Staraptor trouble. Celesteela can take multiple Close Combats and proceed to stall Staraptor with Leech Seed, Mega Scizor can tank a Brave Bird and KO it back with Bullet Punch, and Bisharp can take on Staraptor provided it received a Defiant boost from Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Xurkitree have no trouble dealing with Staraptor can easily KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Staraptor is usually forced to switch against Rock-types out or rely on KOing them with Close Combat. Terrakion, Rhyperior, and Nihilego can pressure Staraptor with their Rock-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Staraptor does not appreciate taking any sort of residual damage; Stealth Rock will wear it down, finding it difficult to use Defog to preserve it for later in the game. Poison shortens Staraptor's longevity, while burns decrease its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Staraptor hates being inflicted by status; Toxic wears it down quickly, paralysis cripples it, and burns decrease its attacking power.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Even after an Intimidate, Staraptor cannot switch into wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite, which outspeeds Staraptor and 2HKOes it with Outrage. Landorus-T can easily break through Staraptor with Stone Edge after a Swords Dance boost.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Defensive Defog (Normal)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird is Staraptor's STAB move, hitting targets that don't resist the attack hard while hitting Bug-, Fighting-, and Grass-types such as Mega Pinsir, Buzzwole, and Mega Venusaur super effectively. Roost is a reliable recovery move that prolongs Staraptor's longevity throughout the match. Defog supports Staraptor's team by clearing the field of entry hazards. U-turn is used to gain momentum for Staraptor's team while safely switching its teammates in.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs and 200 Defense EVs with an Impish nature maximize Staraptor's ability to take physical attacks. 56 Speed EVs allow Staraptor to outspeed Adamant Swords Dance Tapu Bulu, a huge threat to the type. Intimidate helps Staraptor and its teammates tank attacks from physical attackers more effectively. Leftovers grants passive recovery each turn, which Staraptor highly appreciates.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Staraptor into physical attackers that it's able to take on and cripple with Intimidate such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Buzzwole. Thanks to Roost and Intimidate, it's able to continuously switch into physical attackers, so it's always best to keep to Staraptor healthy by using Roost frequently. However, Staraptor needs to be cautious about physical attackers switching into it, because Intimidate will not lower their Attack, sometimes forcing it to switch out and have one of its teammates take a hit from the opposing side. For example, while Staraptor is on the field, Choice Band Dragonite can switch in without worrying about a decrease in Attack and proceed to use Outrage, which forces Staraptor to switch to Porygon2 to tank Dragonite's attack. While Staraptor can check many physical attackers, most setup sweepers such as Landorus-T use it as setup bait, so it needs to be careful. It's very important that Staraptor keeps Stealth Rock off the field as much as possible, as it limits the physical hits Staraptor can take, so switch Staraptor in as soon as the foe sets Stealth Rock to avoid taking damage, and use Defog afterwards. Do not be afraid to use Roost as a means of scouting a strong physical attack, as Staraptor appreciates staying on the field longer for use later in the game. Staraptor should never be used to tank any special attacks; a teammate such as Chansey should. Staraptor should switch into defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Forretress, and opposing Chansey to remove entry hazards with Defog. However, it hates being hit by Toxic from the likes of Toxapex and has no way to spread status, so it loses to most walls one-on-one.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Together, Chansey and Porygon2 create an outstanding defensive core with Staraptor. All teammates appreciate Staraptor's ability to soften physical attacks for its team, its neutrality to Fighting-type attacks, and its ability to remove entry hazards. Chansey is a great partner for Staraptor, as it can sponge special attacks, set up Stealth Rock, switch into status thanks to Natural Cure, spread status with Toxic, and cure Staraptor of any status with Heal Bell. In return, Staraptor can take on physical attackers and Fighting-types. Porygon2 pairs well with Staraptor as another physically defensive tank that can punish setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor with Foul Play and spread status with moves such as Toxic. Porygon-Z appreciates Staraptor's support increasing its chances to take a hit without receiving chip damage so it can sweep more easily. Alongside Staraptor, Meloetta is also another reliable check to Fighting teams thanks to its Psychic typing, and it is able to break through other teams. Meloetta appreciates Staraptor switching into physical attackers that it's weak to, such as Heracross. Diggersby can break through walls for Staraptor thanks to Huge Power, and its Ground typing grants it an immunity to Electric-type attacks and lets it switch into Thunder Wave users such as Klefki and Jirachi. Diggersby can also take on Steel-types such as Heatran. Power-Up Punch + Encore Mega Lopunny can take out walls that Staraptor can't beat, such as Toxapex, and Mega Pidgeot can be an offensive check to Fighting-types, removing some pressure from Staraptor. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X are always a problem for Staraptor, so Choice Scarf Ditto serves as a great way to eliminate them.</p> "

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Thanks to its ability Storm Drain, Gastrodon is one of the two viable Ground-types that are immune to Water-type moves, making it a key partner on Ground teams. Its secondary Water typing gives it an important neutrality to Ice-type moves and lets it wall certain foes like non-Choice Band Mamoswine, and its decent natural bulk enables it to tank even the strongest moves of the metagame, such as Choice Band Diggersby's Return. In addition to its typing and bulk, reliable recovery in the form of Recover enables Gastrodon to continually switch into threatening Pokemon like Greninja and Keldeo. However, Gastrodon's typing also leaves it virtually defenseless against problematic Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, and Pokemon like Volcarona and Alolan Raichu that often carry Grass-type coverage moves. Moreover, Gastrodon has an abysmal Speed stat coupled with a low Special Attack stat, making it prone to losing momentum and susceptible to Taunt from stallbreakers like Mew and Hydreigon. Finally, Gastrodon fights with Seismitoad for a spot on any Ground team as the Water-immune Pokemon, as the latter possesses a superior offensive presence and is able to check Azumarill, one of the greatest threat to Ground teams. On the other hand, Gastrodon's superior longevity thanks to Recover helps it check dangerous foes consistently, which Seismitoad cannot do.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Gastrodon is the only Electric-immune Pokemon Water has access to that also has reliable recovery, making it a very solid option on any balanced Water team. Gastrodon finds its niche on Water-type teams by being able to switch into Trick users such as Latios because of Sticky Hold while also being able to wall Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. Since Gastrodon is only weak to Grass, it is often hard for teams that lack Grass-type coverage to find ways to revenge kill it. It does, however, stack Water teams' natural weakness to Grass-type coverage. Gastrodon's low Speed and passive nature also leave it vulnerable to Taunt from stallbreakers like Mew and Gliscor preventing it from recovering off damage and acting as a wall. Gastrodon does not appreciate being badly poisoned, as it severely limits Gastrodon's ability to effectively wall Pokemon like Mega Diancie. Furthermore, Gastrodon faces competition from Mega Swampert as a team's Electric switch-in; Swampert has the ability to set Stealth Rock, but Gastrodon is a reliable wall and can more easily switch into Electric-type Pokemon lacking Grass-type coverage due to Recover.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p>Acid Armor is an interesting tool over Earth Power that enables Gastrodon to wall and Toxic stall even the most powerful physical attackers, such as Choice Band Dragonite and Diggersby, strong Ice-type Pokemon like Mamoswine and Weavile, or certain setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Cloyster. Unfortunately, using Acid Armor is generally outclassed and unadvised, as giving up on Earth Power means that Gastrodon cannot hurt Toxapex anymore. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature lets Gastrodon better take on or completely wall specially oriented Pokemon like Grass Knot Tapu Koko and Kyurem-B, but it falls short against most Ice-types and Choice Specs Keldeo, which are handled much easier with a physically defensive spread and much harder for the Ground team to cover otherwise. Finally, Earthquake could be used over Earth Power with a Relaxed nature if Calm Mind Keldeo really bothers your team, but Earth Power's generally superior usefulness greatly outweighs the specific utility of Earthquake. With Earthquake, Gastrodon also cannot outspeed or 2HKO Toxapex anymore, which means it has to switch out and potentially risk a teammate getting poisoned by Toxic Spikes or burned by Scald.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Ice Beam allows Gastrodon to hit Tapu Bulu on the switch, preventing it from freely switching in. However, if Gastrodon runs Ice Beam it has to forgo Scald, which would otherwise allow Gastrodon to cripple physical attackers such as Bisharp.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Apart from possible Scald burns, most Grass-type Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Ferrothorn easily tank Gastrodon's moves and can easily KO it or cripple one of its teammates with their Grass-type STAB moves. On top of that, some Pokemon like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Alolan Raichu carry Grass-type coverage moves to beat Gastrodon and some other Water-types. Also, since all of these Pokemon are faster than Gastrodon, they will KO it before it even moves.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Taunt users like Mew and Gliscor easily shut down Gastrodon by preventing it from using either Recover, Toxic, or any other status move.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Unless Gastrodon is using a specially defensive spread, strong special attackers like Kyurem-B and Hydreigon can easily plow through its weaker Special Defense. Moreover, even with the suggested physically defensive spread, Gastrodon is 2HKOed by powerful physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Excadrill, Diggersby, and Dragonite. However, since they cannot OHKO a healthy Gastrodon, those three Pokemon do fear being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Gastrodon's walling potential can be easily deterred with an opposing Toxic, as being badly poisoned cripples Gastrodon to the point where checking threats and simply staying alive become a heavy task.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon can threaten Gastrodon with their STAB attacks, which are 4x effective against it, and resist both of its STAB types.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Due to Gastrodon's low Speed, any Pokemon with a decent amount of bulk and access to Taunt can make Gastrodon near useless, as it relies on Toxic and Recover to be effective in battle.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Mega Gallade can easily cripple Gastrodon with their powerful STAB attacks and threaten to OHKO it with the smallest amount of chip.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Gastrodon does not appreciate being poisoned by Toxic, as it severely limits its longevity in battle. However, common walls that spread Toxic such as Zapdos also do not appreciate being poisoned in return.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Due to Gastrodon's passive nature, setup sweepers can use Gastrodon to set up, such as Double Dance Mew and Volcarona. However, they should be wary of Toxic, as it can severely limit their time in battle.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Defensive Wall (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is used as Gastrodon's main STAB move, as it can burn opposing Pokemon and enable Gastrodon to wall powerful physical wallbreakers like Dragonite and Mega Gallade. Earth Power is Gastrodon's secondary STAB move and synergizes well with Storm Drain, letting it always 2HKO Toxapex after a boost. Recover is Gastrodon's form of reliable recovery, which lets it act as an efficient wall. Toxic is used to cripple most defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W and Porygon2 that are not bothered by Gastrodon's STAB moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Storm Drain gives Gastrodon an immunity to Water-type moves and is the main reason why it's considered as a valuable teammate for Ground. It also has the side effect of raising Gastrodon's Special Attack stat when hit by a Water-type move, making both Scald and Earth Power hit slightly harder. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature makes Gastrodon as physically bulky as possible and enables it to never be 2HKOed by Choice Specs Keldeo. Leftovers gives Gastrodon passive recovery throughout the match and is also needed to beat Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gastrodon is best used when switched in on predicted Water-type moves coming from potent threats like Choice Specs Keldeo, especially if no other viable moves from those Pokemon can seriously harm it. Since Gastrodon is the team's Water-immune Pokemon, it should not be sacrificed, because that would enable threatening Water-types to greatly damage and KO most of its teammates with their STAB moves. Gastrodon also has the luxury of switching into would-be threats for Ground teams, such as Rotom-W and Tapu Koko, without much repercussion. However, watch out for lures that could cripple or OHKO Gastrodon, such as Toxic Rotom-W and Grass Knot Tapu Koko. Scald can be used freely to burn, cripple, and wear down physical attackers as they switch into Gastrodon or try to overpower it. Burning defensive Pokemon that don't care about Toxic, such as Mega Sableye and Celesteela, to slowly whittle them down is also a good idea. Use Toxic to cripple defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine on the switch or to put setup sweepers like Kommo-o and Mega Slowbro on a timer. Against hard matchups, specifically Water, spreading Toxic early-game can also greatly help to give Ground the advantage. Also, when facing Pokemon that are unable to 2HKO or poison Gastrodon, it is advised to Toxic these foes and stall them out with Recover so that Gastrodon has as much HP as possible to check the remaining threats. Try to keep Gastrodon healthy by using Recover so that it can take, if possible, two hits from opposing threats. If this condition is met, Scald or Toxic can be used depending on the remaining Pokemon on the opposing team. However, since it drains momentum from its own team, Gastrodon should be played carefully and make good use of double switches by sponging a Water-type move or a weak attack before switching out to a more favorable teammate if threatening foes like Kyurem-B and Celebi are still alive. Moreover, as Gastrodon possesses very little offensive presence, stallbreakers like Mew and Hydreigon greatly threaten it with Taunt. To play around them, try to double switch as they come in or switch out to a more appropriate teammate on a predicted Taunt to gain momentum, since Gastrodon has no way of dealing with those Pokemon by itself. Finally, like most defensive Pokemon, Gastrodon's stalling capabilities become greatly limited when it's hit by Toxic. Therefore, it's better to avoid opposing status users unless they can't be dealt with another way, such as Porygon2, than by using Toxic against them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Every Ground team appreciates having a teammate such as Gastrodon that can switch into Water-type moves. Hippowdon and Gastrodon form a nice defensive core, as the former walls strong physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and phazes setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, while the latter can switch into Greninja's and Keldeo's moves with ease. Mega Garchomp is a remarkable teammate, as it's the most viable Ground-type (aside from Seismitoad) that outspeeds Azumarill and survives its +6 Aqua Jet after Stealth Rock damage. It can also help Gastrodon deal with Ferrothorn and other Grass-types with its Fire-type coverage moves. Excadrill is a much-needed spinner on Ground teams to get rid of entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, which seriously hinder Gastrodon's longevity and ability to wall certain threats. Excadrill can also clean through weakened teams more easily if paired with Gastrodon thanks to its ability to cripple its switch-ins with Toxic. Additionally, Excadrill can take on most relevant Grass-types for Gastrodon, since they take serious amounts of damage or are OHKOed by its STAB moves. Landorus is a useful and powerful wallbreaker that helps Gastrodon take care of Steel- and Grass-types such as Celesteela (with Gravity support) and Mega Venusaur. Mamoswine is an alternative wallbreaker that eases the Grass and Flying matchups with its Ice STAB moves, being able to pick off weakened Tapu Bulu and Breloom with Ice Shard and take out other threats, namely Zapdos and Ferrothorn, with Icicle Crash and Superpower. Mamoswine also has the added benefit of bringing a secondary Ice-type switch-in thanks to its ability Thick Fat. Mega Steelix is a more niche teammate that performs incredibly well in certain matchups, namely Fairy and Dragon, that Gastrodon greatly struggles against. Gliscor can also from a defensive core with Gastrodon thanks to its Grass-type neutrality and ability to efficiently stallbreak. In fact, Gliscor can shut down many of Gastrodon's defensive answers, such as Celesteela and Mega Veusaur, with Taunt before slowly wearing them down with Earthquake or Knock Off, and, thanks to Poison Heal, can switch into opposing Toxics aimed at Gastrodon. In return, Gastrodon can switch into Ice- and Water-type moves aimed at Gliscor. Dugtrio is a nice teammate that traps and helps Gastrodon dispose of numerous foes like Chansey, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Bulu.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Gastrodon's main Water-type STAB move and also has a chance to burn the foe, allowing it to take on physical attackers like Bisharp. Earth Power also hits Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Water-type attacks such as Seismitoad and Toxapex. Recover allows Gastrodon to stay healthy through the entire match, allowing it to consistently take on foes throughout a battle. Toxic cripples opposing walls such as Porygon2 and setup sweepers such as Kommo-o by putting them on a timer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment alongside a Calm nature allows Gastrodon to act as a mixed wall, avoiding the 2HKO from Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beam, both after Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers gives Gastrodon residual recovery at the end of each turn, allowing it to switch into hazards more easily. Sticky Hold prevents it from being Tricked by Choice-locked Pokemon like Latios and Victini and prevents Knock Off users such as Mega Sableye from removing Gastrodon's Leftovers. Gastrodon can use Storm Drain to help against threats such as Perish trap Azumarill, which threatens balanced Water-type teams. However, running Storm Drain means that Gastrodon will not be able to run Sticky Hold, leaving the team very weak to Trick users such as Latios.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Gastrodon is used on bulkier Water teams that usually lack switch-ins to Trick users like Latios, it should fill this role thanks to Sticky Hold, which prevents it from losing its Leftovers. Gastrodon should be kept as healthy as possible throughout the match so it can easily be switched into strong attacks like Mega Diancie's Moonblast. Gastrodon should especially be kept healthy in matchups like Electric so it can repeatedly switch in on and threaten Pokemon like Alolan Raichu with Earth Power. Gastrodon should avoid being statused with Toxic, as it severely reduces Gastrodon's ability to stay healthy through the match, making it easier to revenge kill. Use Toxic on walls such as Mantine or on Pokemon it cannot threaten with its other attacks such as Zapdos to make it easier for teammates such as Mega Sharpedo to clean late-game. Recover can be used alongside Toxic to put opposing Pokemon on a timer and easily recover off damage. Gastrodon should try to cripple physical attackers such as Bisharp with Scald burns, allowing teammates like Toxapex to more easily take them on. Gastrodon should always scout for Grass-type coverage by switching out on Pokemon like Volcanion. If Gastrodon is using Storm Drain, it should always be used as a switch-in to Perish trap Azumarill, as Storm Drain prevents Azumarill from trapping it with Whirlpool and putting it on a three-turn timer with Perish Song.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex can check setup sweepers such as Kommo-o and Mega Altaria with Haze, set Toxic Spikes to cripple foes, and scout attacks with Baneful Bunker, all while switching into Grass-type attacks such as Ferrothorn's Power Whip. Toxapex can also switch into Toxic and remove Toxic Spikes for Gastrodon. Azumarill provides a Grass-type immunity with access to Sap Sipper and can Perish trap foes like Breloom for Gastrodon, and Gastrodon can switch into Electric-type attacks for Azumarill. Together, they form an immunity core that covers both of Water-types' weaknesses. Mantine appreciates Gastrodon's immunity to Electric-type attacks and can use Haze against setup sweepers like Azumarill and Kommo-o for Gastrodon. Mantine also provides a Ground-type immunity, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Landorus and Excadrill, which Gastrodon and its teammates struggle with, and can clear annoying entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes for Gastrodon to prevent it from being poisoned. Empoleon can support Gastrodon as a bulky teammate neutral to Grass and provide effective hazard control, setting Stealth Rock and clearing hazards with Defog. Suicune also appreciates Gastrodon's ability to switch into Trick. Suicune in turn can stall out Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn with Substitute + Protect. Greninja appreciates that Gastrodon can switch into powerful threats such as Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie for it and can in turn revenge kill Grass-types like Tapu Bulu with Gunk Shot and Ice Beam. Greninja also appreciates Gastrodon's ability to Toxic stall many of its checks down like Porygon2 so it can sweep more easily late-game. Powerful wallbreakers such as Keldeo and Mega Sharpedo similarly appreciate Gastrodon's ability to wear down their checks with Toxic. The former then can break through some of Gastrodon's checks such as Ferrothorn, while the latter can easily sweep late-game and check Taunt users such as Mew and Gliscor for Gastrodon. Gyarados appreciates Gastrodon's ability to Toxic poison Pokemon that might give Gyarados trouble such as Rotom-Wash and in return can take on Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur for Gastrodon with Dragon Dance and Supersonic Skystrike. Mega Slowbro and Gastrodon form an amazing defensive core able to handle most wallbreaking cores, including the fearsome Ground-type core of Landorus and Excadrill.</p> "

Access to utility moves such as Encore allows it to switch in and stop threatening setup sweepers such as Mega Latias and Suicune in their tracks; this can be utilized in conjunction with Power-Up Punch to set up on passive walls such as Toxapex and limit defensive switch-ins such as Celesteela further. Mega Lopunny can also take out massive threats such as Mega Sableye and limit switch-ins thanks to Scrappy. Mega Lopunny’s ability to check massive nuisances to Normal such as Bisharp bolsters its already high viability on Normal teams. Unfortunately, Mega Lopunny’s low defensive stats leave it very vulnerable to Choice Scarf users such as Heracross; its typing prevents it from hard switching into most attacks. Mega Lopunny's weakness to common priority moves from the likes of Breloom and vulnerability to other strong priority attackers such as Mega Scizor and Azumarill after chip damage further hinders its viability. It also lacks the power to break through walls unless it can lock them into passive moves, almost completely limiting it to the role of a revenge killer. While Mega Lopunny is a fantastic Pokemon, it lacks the ability to break through types such as Bug and Grass as easily as Mega Pidgeot due to the latter's No Guard Heat Wave and Hurricane having few to no switch-ins.

Scrappy allows Mega Lopunny to take out threatening Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye with High Jump Kick and Return. Lopunnite allows Lopunny to Mega Evolve and gives it Scrappy and much better stats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Surprise Pokemon using passive moves such as Stealth Rock or any healing move by switching in as they use their passive move and locking them into it with Encore. Utilize Power-Up Punch on switch-ins such as Skarmory or after Mega Lopunny has locked something into a passive move with Encore. Make sure to take advantage of Mega Lopunny's unresisted dual STAB combination and ability to wallbreak by making double switches throughout a game. Capitalize on this especially against teams with massive threats to Normal that Mega Lopunny beats, such as Bisharp. You can also switch Mega Lopunny into Pokemon such as Substitute Zapdos and Suicune and lock them into passive moves, allowing it to freely set up. However, never hard switch Mega Lopunny into attacks unless you’re making a double switch, and bring it in through slow U-turn from users such as Staraptor or after a teammate has fainted. Play conservatively with Mega Lopunny against types that rely on stacking entry hazards, such as Steel, as Mega Lopunny has no reliable recovery and gets worn down very easily, and it should also be preserved against types such as Dark and Ghost where it has potential to get multiple KOs. Steer clear of status, mainly paralysis and burn, as the former prevents Mega Lopunny from successfully revenge killing fast offensive Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and the latter prevents it from breaking through walls. Make sure to play carefully against teams with Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin users such as Skarmory and Garchomp, as they chip Mega Lopunny down so faster revenge killers can safely KO it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey can spread Toxic poison to wear down Pokemon that stop Mega Lopunny, such as Hippowdon; it can also set Stealth Rock to help wear down offensive checks such as Victini. Porygon2 can take attacks from faster revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and slow them down with Thunder Wave for Mega Lopunny. It can also spread Toxic poison to wear down walls. Diggersby can power through Pokemon that beat Mega Lopunny, such as Skarmory, so that Mega Lopunny can be more useful later in the game. Ditto can revenge kill Pokemon such as Mega Altaria that can freely set up on Mega Lopunny. Staraptor switches into Pokemon that revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Choice Scarf Heracross, and can clear entry hazards with Defog, notably Sticky Web, that cripple Mega Lopunny. Porygon-Z can tear through types such as Psychic and Flying that Mega Lopunny tends to struggle with. Meloetta can also power through troublesome walls with a Choice Specs set but can be difficult to fit on teams and is easily forced out by faster offensive Pokemon. Smeargle can provide Sticky Web so Mega Lopunny can outpace faster Pokemon such as the aforementioned Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and other faster threatening Pokemon like Choice Scarf Terrakion; it can also provide entry hazard chip damage with Stealth Rock to wear down bulkier Pokemon.</p> "

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Garchomp is one of the greatest offensive wallbreakers Ground has access to. Its great Attack stat in tandem with Swords Dance allows it to serve as a very solid wallbreaker and setup threat that can break through many bulky Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela. Garchomp's 108 / 95 / 85 bulk is very respectable for an offensive Pokemon, allowing Garchomp to remain in the game for a long time and take strong attacks such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer when at full HP. This goes well with Rough Skin, which punishes most physical attackers and deals chip damage. Garchomp also hits a respectable Speed tier in 102 that allows it to outpace relevant offensive threats such as Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, and Manaphy. Its Dragon typing gives it a neutrality to Grass and Water, something Ground appreciates, though it still fears burns from Scald. Upon Mega Evolution, it becomes a powerful mixed wallbreaker that can take care of Pokemon regular Garchomp has more trouble with such as Skarmory. Mega Garchomp's bulk is also quite noteworthy, as its higher defenses allow it to take very strong moves that regular Garchomp cannot, with the most notable one being Azumarill’s Aqua Jet after Belly Drum. Mega Garchomp's Sand Force allows it to be an even more powerful wallbreaker under sand, which is weather that Ground teams already appreciate. By passing up on the need for an Azumarill check, Mega Garchomp enables Ground teams to viably use Gastrodon, which is a very good wall that can counter the likes of Mega Diancie. Garchomp loses 10 base Speed once it Mega Evolves, however, meaning that Manaphy, Landorus, and other such Pokemon will now be able to outspeed it. While Garchomp's Dragon typing introduces a few key resistances and neutralities, it creates a 4x weakness to common Ice moves, which Ground does not appreciate. In addition, Garchomp’s Speed is decent but leaves it easily outsped by common revenge killers such as Latios and Greninja as well as almost any Choice Scarf user. Because of this, it is not hard to force Garchomp out.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Garchomp's typing, good offensive stats, decent overall bulk, solid Speed tier, and rare access to Stealth Rock make it a desirable option for Dragon teams. Its Ground-type STAB is very much appreciated against Steel- and Poison-types such as Jirachi, Stakataka, Toxapex, and Nidoking. It also prevents Volt Switch pivoting, which can be useful against Electric-types such as Zapdos and Magnezone. Above average bulk also means that Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock easily while also avoiding being 2HKOed by Mega Aerodactyl and Celebi. However, Garchomp has very noticeable weaknesses, including a lack of recovery and weakness to Ice- and Fairy-type moves from Mamoswine and Clefable. Because Garchomp is used primarily for Stealth Rock support, its moveset is often very predictable and simple to play around if pressured correctly. Additionally, Garchomp has trouble breaking some Steel- and Grass-types such as Celesteela and Tapu Bulu, as its best coverage move in Fire Blast doesn't have much power behind it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p>Garchomp can run a Choice Scarf set on some teams. This tends to work only on sandless teams, though, as Ground already has a terrific fast Pokemon in Excadrill, and Garchomp performs best as a wallbreaker. Firium Z is another viable option that can threaten Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor immediately and also OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage and Swords Dance. The general power of Dragonium Z is usually preferred, however. A fully physical Mega Garchomp set with Swords Dance can also work against more defensive teams. However, regular Garchomp's higher Speed and option to run a Z-Move is usually appreciated more. Swords Dance Garchomp can opt to run Sand Veil as its ability, giving it a considerably high chance to dodge attacks, especially inaccurate moves like Hydro Pump.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p>A defensive Garchomp with a spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 Spe holding either Rocky Helmet or Leftovers can be used as a physically defensive tank against the likes of Mega Lopunny and Excadrill. However, the lack of Speed and a Focus Sash on this defensive set leaves Garchomp susceptible to being OHKOed by many attacks it's weak to, such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Hidden Power Ice from Nihilego. It's also vulnerable to slower attackers such as Kyurem-B and Choice Band Tapu Bulu. Garchompite is a niche item that immensely powers up Garchomp's offensive prowess and allows it to become a threatening presence against Steel teams through its powerful coverage. However, this also drops Mega Garchomp's Speed to a point where it's slower than Mega Charizard X, Kyurem-B, and others, providing better setup opportunities for these foes. Additionally, Mega Garchomp faces competition from other Mega Evolutions in Mega Latias and Mega Altaria, as their setup capabilities and recovery options make them more desirable for Dragon teams.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Garchomp is often forced out against Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Clefable, as it's unable to use its Dragon-type STAB attacks. Most Fairy-type STAB moves will also OHKO Garchomp with ease.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Moves: Garchomp's 4x weakness to Ice means it's taken down by almost any faster Pokemon with Ice-type coverage, such as Tapu Koko, Keldeo, or Greninja. It's also taken care of by Ice Shard users, most commonly Mamoswine and Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physical walls such as Skarmory can take on non-Fire Blast variants of Garchomp. Many of them can also take advantage of Draco Meteor’s Special Attack drop and simply recover.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela</strong>: Celesteela is a fantastic check to Garchomp. While Fire Fang does threaten it, it resists Garchomp's STAB combination and can simply use Leech Seed to give Garchomp a much harder time breaking through it. Assault Vest variants usually also carry Hidden Power Ice in order to OHKO Garchomp after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Garchomp's Speed, while good, still leaves it outsped by various revenge killers such as Latios, Greninja, and Weavile, which can all reliably check Garchomp.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Weavile, as well as anything carrying Ice-type coverage such as Greninja, Nihilego, or Keldeo, can threaten to KO Garchomp due to its crippling 4x weakness to Ice-type moves. Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria and Clefable beat Garchomp with their Fairy-type STAB moves while also being immune to Garchomp's Dragon-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Foes: Physically defensive threats such as Celesteela and Gliscor have the bulk to handle any move Garchomp can use and can recover any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Leads: Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, as well as fast Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Aerodactyl, can prevent Garchomp's Stealth Rock while also being able to set up their own entry hazards or spread status. However, Mega Diancie is threatened by Earthquake if Garchomp is at full health.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Though Garchomp carries a Focus Sash to prevent being OHKOed at full health, it still comes under fire from faster offensive threats such as Mega Pinsir and Alakazam once it has taken prior chip damage.</p> </section>",

      {
        "name": "Swords Dance (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Garchomp to raise its Attack stat, allowing it to blow past many Pokemon that are otherwise problematic for Ground, including Zapdos and Mega Venusaur. Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that is able to hit threats that don't resist it hard. Outrage, while a risky move by itself, is able to hit everything except Steel- and Fairy-types for neutral damage and hits most Flying-, Bug-, and Grass-types for neutral damage, unlike Earthquake. However, Outrage's main purpose is to allow Garchomp to fire off its powerful Devastating Drake, giving it extremely limited switch-ins after one use of Swords Dance and turning it into a deadly wallbreaker that is capable of breaking through the Chansey + Porygon2 core on Normal. Lastly, Fire Fang's main purpose is to allow +2 Garchomp to 2HKO Celesteela, OHKO Tapu Bulu after Stealth Rock damage, and OHKO Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Tapu Bulu is an especially noteworthy target, as it is a huge offensive threat to Ground teams. It is also worth mentioning that Fire Fang makes Garchomp hit the entire tier at least neutrally, maximizing its sweeping capabilities.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Garchomp's Attack and Speed while also allowing Garchomp to survive Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer, letting Garchomp inflict two rounds of chip damage and giving it an opportunity to use Fire Fang. A Jolly nature is required, as it allows Garchomp to outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon and above. Dragonium Z allows Garchomp to fire off a powerful Dragon-type move without many drawbacks and break through many defensive Pokemon, including Suicune. Rough Skin enables Garchomp to deal chip damage when it is damaged by a contact move. This gives Garchomp the ability to wear down Rapid Spin users and attackers such as Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Garchomp is best used early-game as a wallbreaker, allowing a teammate to sweep later with more ease. The player has to be wary about when to set up with Swords Dance, however. It is best to set up once all Fairy- and Steel-types have been KOed or worn down, as they can wear Garchomp down and waste its Z-Move. Faster revenge killers that can KO Garchomp such as Greninja and Mega Diancie should also be taken care of. Garchomp should set up against slower, more passive threats such as Staraptor and Armaldo, as its good natural bulk will give it a lot of opportunities to do so. This also goes well with Rough Skin inflicting useful chip damage on some of these Pokemon. Stealth Rock will give Garchomp an easier time with wallbreaking, as Garchomp naturally forces a lot of switches and Stealth Rock damage secures KO opportunities against Pokemon such as Suicune. Another thing to note is that it is important to be very selective when using Devastating Drake, as it is a one-time use move that resistant or immune Pokemon can take advantage of by simply switching in. Also, Garchomp should avoid getting poisoned or burned, as the former can wear it down throughout the game and the latter minimizes its usefulness. It is possible to use Garchomp as a late-game cleaner once all of its faster checks and defensive answers are weakened or fainted.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Excadrill is a terrific teammate for Garchomp, as Garchomp can break down most defensive Pokemon and provide a switch-in to Fire-types, while Excadrill beats the pesky Fairy- and Ice-types that trouble Garchomp and discourage it from using its Dragon-type attacks. Sand also allows Excadrill to be a huge threat to more offensive teams, clearing the way for Garchomp to wallbreak. Hippowdon is a good Stealth Rock user that benefits Garchomp and the entire team with sand support, dealing chip damage to most Pokemon and giving the previously mentioned Excadrill a Speed boost. It's important to preserve Garchomp before setting up, so Hippowdon's ability to sponge many physical attacks is appreciated. Mamoswine is a good teammate that possesses a legitimate Ice resistance, giving Garchomp a switch-in to some of the Ice-type attacks it is so weak to such as Greninja's Ice Beam. Seismitoad can switch into the Scald users that threaten Garchomp and help beat some of the bulkier Ground- and Fairy-types that Garchomp may have trouble with, such as Hippowdon and Belly Drum Azumarill. Landorus and Garchomp form a deadly wallbreaking core that puts a large amount of pressure on balanced teams due to its combined coverage and sheer wallbreaking power. Dugtrio is a good team option that can effectively trap threats such as Tapu Bulu and other fast Pokemon that prevent Garchomp from setting up. Lastly, Gastrodon offers a useful Water immunity while walling Mega Diancie, which can otherwise outspeed and KO Garchomp. Toxic support from it can also gradually wear down walls that can take on Garchomp.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Wallbreaker (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Mega Garchomp's main STAB move, allowing Mega Garchomp to dent many Pokemon that don't resist it and outright OHKO frailer Pokemon. Earthquake is the secondary STAB move of choice, as it allows Garchomp to have physically offensive presence using its naturally great Attack and hits very hard even without investment. Fire Blast offers great coverage that primarily hits Skarmory. It also allows Garchomp to threaten Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which otherwise wall it. Finally, Stone Edge completes coverage and allows Mega Garchomp to nail Flying-types such as Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed are used to capitalize on Mega Garchomp's mixed wallbreaking potential. A Naive nature is chosen in order for Mega Garchomp to hit the highest Speed tier possible without lowering its Attack. In addition, being Naive allows Garchomp to always survive an Aqua Jet from +6 Azumarill after Stealth Rock, though it also gives Assault Vest Celesteela a chance to OHKO it with entry hazard support. Garchompite is required for Garchomp to Mega Evolve. Rough Skin is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving, as Garchomp may get some useful chip damage while switching in on attacks. Sand Force boosts the power of Earthquake and Stone Edge in sand, something Garchomp appreciates due to most Ground teams utilizing Hippowdon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Garchomp is used best as an early-game wallbreaker under sand, as Hippowdon's Sand Stream will allow it to eliminate threats that may impede a faster Pokemon like Excadrill from sweeping late-game. Stealth Rock should be on the field early in the game, as the offensive pressure Mega Garchomp places on teams will also force a lot of switches, helping it rack up Stealth Rock and sand damage. Take advantage of Mega Garchomp's great bulk, as it can switch comfortably into weaker attacks such as Giga Drain from Mega Venusaur. However, while its bulk is great, Mega Garchomp lacks any kind of recovery, so it is not recommended to play recklessly with it. Mega Garchomp can be stalled by many walls due to Draco Meteor lowering Special Attack; because of this, Mega Garchomp can find some difficulty breaking through physical walls. Also, Mega Garchomp should be preserved in certain matchups such as Flying and Grass, as it becomes an important wincon against threats that can otherwise trouble the team. Mega Garchomp should avoid being inflicted with status as much as it can, since a burn can reduce its Attack stat and Toxic poison gradually wears it down. The player should not necessarily Mega Evolve Garchomp instantly, as Garchomp's Speed before Mega Evolving will allow it to outspeed Pokemon like those with base 100 Speed, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B. However, Mega Evolving does give Garchomp much-improved bulk. Lastly, Mega Garchomp can bait the likes of Ferrothorn and Skarmory by not Mega Evolving immediately and not revealing Fire Blast.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Excadrill forms a deadly sand core with Mega Garchomp, as Excadrill can easily take care of faster threats and double as a solid physical wallbreaker while Mega Garchomp can break through Skarmory and similar threats. Sand support from Hippowdon is also vital for Mega Garchomp, as it boosts the power of Earthquake and Stone Edge, allowing Mega Garchomp to more easily check Mega Venusaur and other such Pokemon. Dugtrio is a good teammate for Mega Garchomp. Between the two, they can consistently trap and eliminate Tapu Bulu, one of the biggest threats to Ground, thanks to Mega Garchomp’s Fire Blast and Dugtrio’s Sludge Wave. Landorus-T can pressure some of Mega Garchomp's switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur and additionally put pressure on more offensive teams due to its setup options in Swords Dance and Rock Polish. Mamoswine brings an Ice resistance that allows it to take on Greninja and other users of Ice-type moves that threaten Garchomp. Gastrodon is a great teammate that can wear down bulkier Pokemon such as Zapdos and Porygon2 with Toxic as well as offer a legitimate Water immunity, something the entire team appreciates. It is the preferred Water-immune Pokemon, as Seismitoad isn't needed to check Azumarill since Mega Garchomp takes a +6 Aqua Jet from it. Knock Off support is also appreciated in order to negate Leftovers recovery and remove Eviolite from Pokemon such as Porygon2. Landorus is another great teammate that can put a large amount of pressure on balanced teams in combination with Mega Garchomp. Additionally, Landorus can offer Gravity support to help Mega Garchomp with threats like Celesteela and Zapdos. Finally, Gliscor is a solid stallbreaker that can wear down many of Mega Garchomp's checks thanks to utility options such as Taunt and Toxic.</p> "

        "name": "Stealth Rock Lead (Dragon)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock damages foes upon entry and is incredibly useful for weakening threatening Ice-types such as Weavile and Kyurem-B. Earthquake is Garchomp's best Ground-type STAB move and hits problematic Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Toxapex for super effective damage. Outrage is Garchomp's primary Dragon-type STAB move and most powerful move that really is meant to deal damage to Pokemon that are immune to or resist Ground such as Tornadus-T and Breloom. Alternatively, Toxic is an option against physically defensive foes or Defoggers such as Slowbro, Mantine, and Zapdos as a pressure tool, putting them on a timer. Fire Blast is used against Steel-types that are not weak to Earthquake, such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs as well as a Naive nature allow Garchomp to hit as hard and as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Mega Charizard X and Landorus. Rough Skin enables Garchomp to slightly damage any foe that makes physical contact with it. Focus Sash allows Garchomp to take any hit from full health and is especially useful to let it threaten to KO Mega Diancie and Latios when completely healthy and guarantee setting Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Garchomp set acts as the lead for many Dragon teams, as its main purpose is to set Stealth Rock to allow teammates like Dragonite and Kyurem-B to break down the vast majority of the metagame. Because of this role, Garchomp is quite expendable once Stealth Rock is safely on the field. However, keep Garchomp healthy against Steel teams, as its Ground- and Fire-type coverage can break down many bulky foes such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Avoid residual damage from entry hazards and status conditions, as they both break Garchomp's Focus Sash and allow foes such as Latios and Keldeo to OHKO it. While Garchomp acts as a lead, it can still effectively damage the foe. To deal more damage to the opponent once Stealth Rock is set, avoid being burned, as it inhibits Garchomp's damage output. Celesteela and Gliscor in particular are the two greatest pivots into anything Garchomp can do despite it having coverage for the former, so it's ideal to switch in Kyurem-B in anticipation of either foe switching in. In turn, this will consistently apply pressure to the opponent, forcing many switches while still keeping offensive momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Latios acts as both a revenge killer and Defog user for Garchomp and can check certain foes that would otherwise threaten Garchomp, such as Keldeo and Nihilego. Kyurem-B has arguably the best BoltBeam coverage in the metagame, which pairs amazingly with Garchomp's Stealth Rock to blast through Flying teams. In return, Garchomp soft checks Steel-types that threaten Kyurem-B, such as Scizor and Ferrothorn. Mega Latias is a setup sweeper that appreciates Stealth Rock chipping down foes throughout the battle. It utilizes its insane bulk, Calm Mind, and Refresh to break down incredibly strong walls like Porygon2 and Mantine that Garchomp can't do much against without Toxic. Mega Altaria is another setup sweeper that can use Dragon Dance and Refresh to break down bulky pivots in Mega Sableye and Zapdos, as well as checking opposing Dragon-types in Mega Latias and Dragonite. Choice Band Dragonite is a powerful physical wallbreaker that can break down defensive walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor. Additionally, Dragonite's access to Extreme Speed is important for revenge killing faster threats like Choice Scarf Greninja and Weavile that would threaten Garchomp immensely. Kommo-o is a mixed setup sweeper that utilizes Kommonium Z to fire off a powerful attack against the foe while also boosting all of its stats, helping to break defensive pivots like Mega Venusaur and Mandibuzz. Together, Garchomp and Kommo-o create a Steel-breaking core through the combination of their coverage. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a lesser-used team's way of keeping faster foes in check, but it has the ability to scare off Psychic-types that can wall Garchomp, such as Mew and Reuniclus. Its access to U-turn also allows Dragon teams to keep up offensive momentum.</p> "

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Lucario is a strong wallbreaker for Steel teams thanks to its access to Swords Dance making it a potent setup sweeper. Extreme Speed allows Lucario to also be a fantastic late-game cleaner against offensive teams. Lucario helps Steel teams in many matchups, such as against Dark, Normal, and opposing Steel, as it is capable of taking on threatening Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Chansey, and Heatran. However, Lucario does not provide any defensive utility to Steel teams and compounds the natural weakness to Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. Due to Lucario's rather middling Speed, it is threatened by most speedy attackers and relies on Extreme Speed to take on faster Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Mega Charizard X, which would otherwise beat it. Lucario also does not appreciate being burned or paralyzed, and it competes for a slot on Steel teams with other Swords Dance sweepers such as Bisharp, which can take on Psychic-type Pokemon such as Victini and Mega Latios.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Lucario's great secondary Steel typing, access to Swords Dance, and access to strong priority moves in Bullet Punch and Extreme Speed make it a decent offensive option for Fighting teams. Its typing gives Lucario a neutrality to all of Fighting's weaknesses and allows it to become effective in matchups such as Fairy and Psychic. Additionally, it offers utility in matchups like Dragon thanks to its numerous resistances and immunities. Lucario is the only Pokemon in the metagame with access to both Swords Dance and Extreme Speed, compensating for its average Speed stat and allowing Lucario to wallbreak while potentially avoiding revenge killers such as Greninja after a boost. However, it is often very difficult to successfully set up with Lucario, as its average Speed, bad bulk, and dependency on Life Orb in order to wallbreak make it extremely easy to wear down. Lucario's typing, despite offering many useful resistances, leaves it weak to very common offensive types like Fighting, Ground, and Fire, allowing revenge killers such as Garchomp and Infernape to easily check it. Lastly, it is often very difficult to fit Lucario on teams, as it shares a typing with Fighting's best entry hazard setter, Cobalion. Other setup sweepers such as Breloom also give Lucario competition, taking on threats that Lucario cannot, such as Swampert.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p>An Adamant nature allows Lucario to hit insanely hard and 2HKO Celesteela while still outspeeding key threats such as Heatran, but this leaves it walled by many Pokemon, such as Nidoking and Jolly Diggersby. However, its ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Keldeo with +2 Extreme Speed with less chip damage while also almost always OHKOing Swampert with +2 Close Combat makes Adamant better in the Water matchup. Thunder Punch with Electrium Z and a Jolly Nature is an option over Earthquake, as Gigavolt Havoc can KO Pokemon that traditionally wall Lucario such as Mantine and Slowbro after Stealth Rock chip at +2. Meteor Mash is Lucario's most reliable Steel-type STAB move and allows it to take on Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu. However, Meteor Mash is a bit redundant on Lucario, as its teammates run Steel-type STAB moves, and forgoing Earthquake or Ice Punch leaves Lucario unable to check Pokemon such as Toxapex and Gliscor, respectively.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>A Jolly nature may be useful for outspeeding certain Pokemon such as Nidoking and Suicune, but this generally isn't worth the loss of wallbreaking power that comes with an Adamant nature and loses out on important OHKOs on Pokemon like Skarmory after Swords Dance and Stealth Rock. Justified is usable as an ability to allow Lucario to steadily take on Foul Play and Knock Off users, but that role is usually occupied by other Pokemon with the ability such as Terrakion and Keldeo.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Faster Fighting-type Pokemon such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Gallade all threaten to OHKO Lucario with their powerful STAB attacks. However, Mega Gallade should watch out for Extreme Speed, as spamming Close Combat severely lowers its Defense.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon such as Infernape, Mega Charizard X, and Blacephalon all threaten to OHKO Lucario with their powerful STAB moves. Bulky Fire-type Pokemon such as Torkoal can easily tank a boosted Close Combat and threaten to OHKO Lucario in return.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus and Sand Rush Excadrill threaten to outspeed and OHKO Lucario with their powerful STAB moves. Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon can easily tank a boosted Close Combat and OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Slowbro can easily tank any of Lucario's attacks and, recover off the damage, and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Scald, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast Pokemon with strong STAB moves such as Landorus-T, Victini, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny can outspeed Lucario and OHKO it with their STAB attacks. However, all of these Pokemon can't easily take on Lucario if it has set up a Swords Dance, as they are threatened by Extreme Speed.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers: While unboosted, Lucario usually lacks the power to OHKO opposing Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types such as Landorus-T, Volcarona, and Keldeo, which can all KO it in return with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Lucario struggles to break past bulky walls such as Slowbro and Mantine, as they take minimal damage from its moves and can threaten Lucario by means of status and Haze.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex's fantastic physical bulk and resistance to both of Lucario's STAB moves make it an excellent defensive counter to Lucario. Additionally, Toxapex can burn Lucario with Scald and clear its Swords Dance boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: In a similar vein, Flying-types like Mega Charizard Y resist Lucario's Fighting-type STAB attacks and can easily beat it with their coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Even with Lucario's access to priority, it is unable to make use of its lackluster Speed to handle revenge killers like Latios without heavy chip damage or prior Swords Dance boosts.</p> <p><strong>Status: Although it is immune to poison, Lucario's sweeping ability is disabled by burns and paralysis.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance turns Lucario into a very threatening wallbreaker and lets it gain important OHKOs, such as against Mandibuzz with Close Combat after Stealth Rock. Close Combat is Lucario's main STAB attack and its most spammable attack. Extreme Speed allows Lucario to revenge kill faster weakened foes such as Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko throughout the battle. Lucario uses Earthquake to reliably hit Fighting-resistant Poison-types like Toxapex, which would otherwise easily wall Lucario. Ice Punch is an option that allows Lucario to reliably hit Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-type Pokemon, most notably Gliscor, which is otherwise a nuisance to Steel-type teams and can easily overwhelm the rest of the team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature lets Lucario hit as hard as possible while outspeeding threats such as Nidoking and Suicune, which Lucario cannot outspeed if running an Adamant nature. Life Orb boosts Lucario's damage output, allowing it to secure many more OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as against Toxapex and Mandibuzz, respectively. Justified lets Lucario take advantage of passive walls such as Mandibuzz that check setup sweepers with Foul Play as well as other weak Dark-type attacks such as Alolan Muk's Knock Off.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Lucario is not very bulky, it cannot reliably set up multiple times throughout the match and needs to set up Swords Dance at the right time, such as against non-threatening Choice-locked Pokemon such as Hydreigon locked into Dark Pulse. Lucario should set up safely once its main checks such as Mega Sableye have been weakened enough to a point where Lucario can handle them. Lucario should be used as a revenge killer by bringing it in after a teammate has fainted and either setting up with Swords Dance or just attacking with Close Combat, depending on the opposing team. Like other setup sweepers, Lucario does not appreciate status conditions and should avoid being burned or paralyzed, as they severely hinder its ability to sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All Steel-type Pokemon appreciate Lucario's wallbreaking potential, ability to beat Pokemon such as Toxapex, and ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y. Celesteela is a Ground-immune partner that can switch into fast attackers such as Excadrill for Lucario. Celesteela can also help Lucario set up safely by providing Leech Seed support. In return, Lucario can take on walls like Toxapex and Mandibuzz for Celesteela. Heatran can check Fire-types for Lucario and break Pokemon that it has difficulty against such as Mega Venusaur with Magma Storm and Taunt. Skarmory is another Ground-immune partner; however, instead of supporting Lucario with Leech Seed, Skarmory can set entry hazards so Lucario can more easily clean late-game. Lucario can also take care of Pokemon such as Choice Specs Magnezone that try to trap and kill Skarmory. Mega Scizor is a fantastic slow offensive pivot that can bring in Lucario safely. Mega Scizor and Lucario also form an insane offensive Swords Dance spam core; they can whittle down each other's checks such as Keldeo and are walled by only a few Pokemon together, such as Zapdos. Choice Scarf Excadrill can outspeed many key threats such as Tapu Koko that trouble Lucario, and it appreciates Lucario's ability to take on some of its counters such as Skarmory and Celesteela. Ferrothorn can stack hazards for Lucario while also providing Leech Seed support and acting as a blanket check to many special attackers such as Greninja and Latios. It also sports a resistance to Water, letting it check foes such as Mega Swampert, which Lucario otherwise struggles with. Bisharp also forms a fantastic Swords Dance spam core with Lucario, as it can take on Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that give Lucario trouble such as Victini and Blacephalon. Z-Happy Hour Jirachi can to take on troublesome Poison- and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur and Keldeo for Lucario.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Lucario to become a dangerous wallbreaker in tandem with its STAB move combination, breaking past problematic Pokemon such as Skarmory after a boost. Close Combat is Lucario's strongest and most spammable move, hitting Steel-types that resist its other moves such as Mega Scizor. Extreme Speed is used to give Lucario a strong form of priority, giving it the ability to clean weakened teams late-game after a boost and revenge kill weakened faster Pokemon throughout the battle. Meteor Mash allows Lucario to mainly hit problematic Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu while offering great neutral coverage, being able to hit Pokemon that resist Close Combat such as Mega Venusaur as well as threaten them with a decent chance to raise its Attack by one stage. Bullet Punch, although much weaker than Meteor Mash, is another priority move that most notably OHKOes Mega Diancie while still dealing with threats like the aforementioned Tapu Bulu after a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs, an Adamant nature, and Life Orb all combine to make Lucario as strong as possible, compensating for its average Attack stat and threatening many defensive Pokemon like Celesteela. The rest of the EVs are invested into Speed, which, even with a neutral nature, allow Lucario to outspeed Pokemon such as Heatran and Tapu Bulu. All of Lucario's abilities are very situational, but Inner Focus is chosen in order to avoid flinches from Pokemon such as Togekiss.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lucario can be used as both a strong wallbreaker with its STAB moves and a late-game cleaner and revenge killer thanks to Extreme Speed. To expand on this, Lucario depends on a boost from Swords Dance in order to perform either of these roles, and it can usually only find setup opportunities by forcing switches. Switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur can be taken care of if Lucario uses Swords Dance on the predicted switch, eliminating many of its potential counters. When dangerous Pokemon such as Latios and Alolan Raichu are present, it is wise to preserve Lucario in order to revenge kill them once they have been weakened. It is especially important to play carefully with Lucario in the Fairy matchup, as it is Fighting's best Pokemon in the matchup, threatening almost any potential switch-in. Furthermore, Lucario's frailty allows it to be easily checked by Pokemon like Tapu Koko, so it is important to bring it out late-game when these Pokemon have been put in range of its priority moves. Lucario should be used as a late-game sweeper in other matchups such as Dragon, as most Pokemon are susceptible to its priority moves once weakened, especially after a Swords Dance. Furthermore, it is generally recommended to not bring out Lucario on any strong attack, as even resisted moves from the likes of Tapu Bulu will heavily damage it due to its poor bulk. Lucario should avoid getting worn down as much as possible altogether, as the recoil from Life Orb combined with its poor bulk makes it not difficult to revenge kill. Although Lucario's immunity to poison can be taken advantage of, it still heavily dislikes all other forms of status, as getting burned will remove its offensive presence while getting paralyzed allows it to be easily outsped.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Lucario's teammates appreciate its wallbreaking and setup ability in matchups such as Fairy. Keldeo is an essential teammate that benefits Lucario and the rest of the team alike by providing a much-needed special wallbreaker, able to deal with threats like Mega Sableye while Lucario can revenge kill threats like Greninja in return. Choice Scarf Terrakion's ability to keep faster foes in check is very appreciated, as Lucario's lackluster Speed stat prevents it from breaking past faster Pokemon like Blacephalon. Mega Gallade forms a deadly wallbreaking core with Lucario, being able to break past troublesome Poison- and Water- types like Toxapex and Mantine while Lucario can threaten offensive playstyles with priority and Fairy-types with its super effective STAB moves. Due to Lucario's shared typing with Cobalion, other teammates that can provide Stealth Rock support are appreciated. Infernape is a decent suicide lead, and Kommo-o can compress a Stealth Rock role while posing as another dangerous special sweeper. Pokemon that can aid Lucario in the troublesome Psychic matchup make for good teammates. Heracross and Buzzwole are both great Choice Scarf users that can easily sweep when combined with Lucario's ability to revenge kill foes like Latios. Breloom is another user of priority that can provide utility with its unique access to Spore, allowing it to become a dangerous setup threat while also giving Lucario safe opportunities to switch in and set up as well. Although Lucario generally isn't bothered by most entry hazards, Defog support from Hawlucha is appreciated, as it prevents Lucario from getting worn down as quickly. Additionally, Defog helps Lucario heavily in the Fairy matchup by removing Klefki's Reflect.</p> "

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon's access to Sand Stream makes it a reliable choice on sand-based Ground teams that have Sand Rush Excadrill. It is one of the best Ground-type walls thanks to its high defensive stats and access to reliable recovery in Slack Off. It's also a great support Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock, making it a must-have on any balanced Ground-type team. It also has access to some utility moves, including Whirlwind, which prevents Hippowdon from being complete setup bait, especially to threats that resist its STAB move. Sand Stream is very useful for easing the matchup against rain and sun teams. Hippowdon's average special bulk makes it easily beat down by powerful special wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Landorus, and its low Speed tier makes it harder for it to set up Stealth Rock and leaves it weak to fast Taunt users such as Mew. It should avoid facing Toxic users such as Porygon2 and Zapdos, as it can't do much back if it doesn't carry a status-inflicting move. Lastly, Hippowdon's Ground typing makes it weak to Water, Grass, and Ice, which are common offensive types and commonly used as coverage moves, making it harder for Hippowdon to perform well as a defensive Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide is a good alternative to Earthquake, serving to hit Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos. Stone Edge is usable to OHKO Mega Pinsir, but it is less accurate. Toxic can be run if you want to cripple walls and stall with Hippowdon. A support set with Slack Off / Toxic / Earthquake / Whirlwind is also an option, but only if you already run Stealth Rock on a teammate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Hippowdon can't take hits from strong Water-type attackers such as Keldeo and Greninja and usually takes huge damage from bulky Water-types' Scald while being unable to do much back.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Pokemon such as Breloom and Mega Venusaur can easily switch on Earthquake and do heavy damage to Hippowdon with their STAB moves. Bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Cradily can easily set up Spikes or Stealth Rock on it.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Mew, and Gliscor can shut Hippowdon down thanks to Taunt, making it unable to set up Stealth Rock or recover with Slack Off and leaving it vulnerable to an incoming wallbreaker or bulky setup sweeper.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters: Mega Charizard Y, Pelipper, and Politoed can all come on Hippowdon to disable sand for their respective weather and deal huge damage to Hippowdon with their STAB moves. Z-Rain Dance users such as Manaphy can set up rain and Tail Glow by forcing Hippowdon out.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers: Strong special attackers such as Meloetta and Choice Specs Hydreigon can easily break through Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic poison weakens Hippowdon and makes it unable to check threats. Burn also annoys Hippowdon, as it can no longer deal big damage with Earthquake or Rock Slide and loses Leftovers's recovery.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock helps against Fire, Flying and Bug teams, breaks Focus Sashes, and deals chip damage. Hippowdon can easily set it up thanks to its great bulk. Earthquake is Hippowdon's main way to deal damage, wearing down frail sweepers and ensuring that Hippowdon won't be complete Taunt fodder. Slack Off helps keep Hippowdon healthy, making it able to pivot throughout the battle. Whirlwind is nice for phazing setup sweepers such as Landorus-T and Mimikyu and works very well in tandem with Stealth Rock and Sand Stream to wear the opposing team down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Defense and HP EVs are used to maximize Hippowdon's physical bulk, allowing it to take on strong physical attackers such as Bisharp, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Scizor. A Relaxed nature makes Hippowdon slower than both Pelipper and Politoed, allowing it to always get its own weather up in a lead situation. Leftovers is the preferred item choice on Hippowdon if you want passive recovery. However, Eject Button can be used on more offensive teams to keep momentum. Rocky Helmet is also an option to deal chip damage to contact attack users, but using Leftovers or Eject Button is often preferred. A mixed EV spread such as 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 SpD can be used to more easily tank special attacks; 116 Special Defense EVs let Hippowdon take a Fire Blast or Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y, a Draco Meteor from Latios, and one Grass Knot or two uses of Hidden Power Ice from Choice Specs Tapu Koko. Sand Stream is mandatory, as it allows Excadrill to sweep with Sand Rush, boosts Mega Garchomp's attacks, and deals chip damage to break Focus Sashes and Multiscale.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hippowdon's main feature is Stealth Rock, so set it up early and try to keep it up throughout the battle to pressure the opponent. Hippowdon has to avoid special attackers such as Latios and Xurkitree as much as possible; it should be used only to check physical attackers such as Dragonite, Terrakion, and Staraptor. Sand Stream is helpful when it comes to checking other weather teams; for example, Hippowdon can set up sand against rain teams to ensure that Kingdra won't sweep your team. Hippowdon makes a good lead because it has the advantage in some matchups such as Electric, Fairy, and Bug, breaks Focus Sashes with sand, and has enough bulk to tank hits and set Stealth Rock, but don't lead with it against anti-leads, Taunt users such as Mew and Air Balloon Heatran, or lead Jirachi, which often runs Toxic. Don't lead against Torkoal or Mega Charizard Y, which have lower Speed or Mega Evolve to set up weather after Hippowdon. Hippowdon should be kept healthy throughout the match with Slack Off and used often to pivot and set up sand for Excadrill or wall threats. To maintain its staying power, avoid Toxic and Will-O-Wisp whenever possible. If using Eject Button, bring it in on an attack to switch out to the appropriate teammate to keep up momentum; don't bring Hippowdon if sand is still up unless you need the aforementioned momentum. Don't keep Hippowdon in on a hit; it will waste the Eject Button and a turn if it gets hit. When switching Hippowdon into physical setup sweepers, immediately phaze them with Whirlwind; despite its great bulk, Hippowdon can't take strong boosted attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Excadrill benefits immensely from the sand that Hippowdon sets, doubling its Speed to easily sweep; Excadrill can also come on Toxic for Hippowdon. Gastrodon and Seismitoad have an immunity to Water thanks to their abilities and can easily come on most special attackers if running EVs in Special Defense or holding Assault Vest. Mega Garchomp also profits from sand, which boosts its Ground- and Rock-type attacks, making it more threatening to the opposing team. Dugtrio is a good teammate that can trap some threats such as Xurkitree and Victini as well as set up Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot on Hippowdon. Hippowdon sets up Stealth Rock and can create setup opportunities for Landorus-T, which threatens Flying, Grass, and offensive teams with its Rockium Z Double Dance set. Landorus-T's Intimidate can help Hippowdon take physical hits more easily. Landorus can easily beat Grass-type teams thanks to its Life Orb- and Sheer Force-boosted Earth Power and Sludge Wave, and it can also set up Gravity, which allows it to easily threaten and wear down Flying teams. Nidoking is an option over Landorus for its ability to threaten Grass-, Flying-, and Water-type teams as well as set up Toxic Spikes to pressure the opponent's team. Choice Band Mamoswine is a nice teammate that can help against Grass- and Flying-type teams and switch in on Ice-type attacks thanks to its typing and Thick Fat. Gliscor is a stallbreaker that can absorb status and take on most of the walls that force Hippowdon out.</p> "

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dark</h1> <p>Weavile's Ice typing, blistering Speed, and good Attack allow it to offensively check a plethora of threats to Dark teams such as Mega Altaria and Tornadus-T, giving it a valuable niche as a revenge killer. With access to good STAB moves in Ice Shard and Icicle Crash, Weavile is able to check the likes of Garchomp, Gliscor, and both formes of Landorus. Dark teams also appreciate Weavile's utility with Pursuit and Knock Off, as the former allows it to trap certain threats like Mega Gallade after a Close Combat, and the latter helps remove items from walls like Alolan Muk and Chansey. However, due to Weavile's lackluster bulk, it cannot afford to take many hits. Its additional Ice typing also does not do it any favors, as it makes it weak to Rock- and Fire-type moves, which are commonly used as coverage moves, as well as to Stealth Rock. This, along with its lackluster bulk, leaves Weavile open to getting revenge killed by faster Pokemon and priority users like Scizor, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Dragonite. Weavile is also somewhat difficult to fit onto balance teams due to its frailty and Dark teams' lack of free teamslots on more defensive builds.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>Weavile's extremely high Speed enables it to outpace speedy threats such as Greninja and Serperior, which makes it an amazing revenge killer. It is also a very potent offensive threat because of its powerful attacks in Knock Off and Icicle Crash along with a solid Attack stat. A priority move in Ice Shard notably allows it to check fast attackers such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Garchomp. On top of all of this, Pursuit allows Weavile trap Psychic-types such as -1 Victini and Latios. However, Weavile doesn't take hits very well, which often means that a sacrifice is necessary to bring it in safely. Along with its terrible defenses, Weavile is weak to common Rock-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, which also leaves it susceptible to Stealth Rock and common priority moves. Finally, Weavile doesn't have many coverage options to hit Steel-types with, outside of Low Kick, and is extremely predictable because of its rather shallow movepool.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p>Low Kick can be used over Pursuit so that Weavile can catch Pokemon like Tyranitar, Kyurem-B, and Bisharp off guard; however, giving up the ability to Pursuit trap can harm Weavile's utility in some situations. Weavile can also run a wallbreaker set with Swords Dance over Pursuit and one of Darkinium Z + Foul Play, which allows it to take out threats like Keldeo and Toxapex after a Swords Dance, and Groundium Z + Dig, permitting it to act as a lure against Heatran.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>Choice Band can be run for extra power, which gives Weavile a chance to 2HKO Celesteela. However, it is outclassed by Life Orb because Weavile often wants the ability to switch up moves and hates being forced out, as it has a hard time finding opportunities to switch back in. Swords Dance can be used to boost Weavile's Attack, but it is extremely hard to set up safely. Weavile can run Poison Jab to KO lured Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable, but it will miss out on the added coverage of Low Kick or the ability to trap Psychic-types with Pursuit.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users: Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Dragonite all heavily threaten Weavile with their strong priority moves and can often take an Ice Shard from it too.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Due to Weavile's additional Ice typing, it has weaknesses to Fire, Rock, Fighting, and Steel, all of which are relatively common coverage moves. Examples include Close Combat on Zeraora, V-create on Victini, Power Gem on Nihilego, and Iron Head on Excadrill. This in tandem with its fragility leaves it weak to a multitude of Pokemon that carry these moves and can take a hit from it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to its fragility and typing, Weavile is susceptible to getting revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Pokemon like Celesteela and Toxapex wall Weavile completely and can either KO it back or use status to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Weavile is hindered by every status ailment bar freeze. Burn cuts down its revenge killing power, paralysis makes it harder for Weavile to revenge kill anything, and poison also limits Weaviles overall usability by putting it on a timer. Due to this, Weavile has to avoid any Pokemon that often use status moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Any form of entry hazards as well as chip damage from sand or Leech Seed hinders Weavile's overall usability, as it limits the number of times it can come in and makes it harder for it to find safe opportunities to switch in.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor can easily switch in on all of Weavile's attacks and can either set up Swords Dance, recover its HP with Roost, or OHKO Weavile with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Keldeo</strong>: Keldeo can take two hits from Weavile and OHKO it with Secret Sword.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Buzzwole can take a hit from Weavile and OHKO it with their Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Weavile struggles to break physical walls such as Skarmory, Torkoal, and Mega Slowbro. Mega Slowbro can easily set up Calm Mind on Weavile, while Torkoal and Skarmory can set up entry hazards on it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Klefki can take multiple hits from Weavile and can OHKO it with their Fairy-type attacks. However, certain Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable need to be wary of the rare Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Torkoal and Rotom-H resist Weavile's Ice-type attacks and take minimal damage from Knock Off. In return, they can retaliate with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Alomomola and Toxapex, along with other bulky Water-types, can take multiple hits from Weavile while also fishing for burns with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Weavile is extremely frail, so revenge killers such as Scizor, Victini, and Buzzwole can OHKO it. Priority users such as Scizor and Breloom deserve a special mention, as they can easily revenge kill Weavile with Bullet Punch or Mach Punch. However, most revenge killers can't directly switch into Weavile.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status ailments cripple Weavile, especially burn and paralysis, as the former halves Weavile's Attack while the latter halves its Speed, its greatest asset.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Weavile loses a quarter of its health if it switches in on Stealth Rock, decreasing Weavile's longevity because it decreases the number of rounds of Life Orb recoil that Weavile can take.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Icicle Crash is Weavile's most powerful STAB move and is used to hit Flying-, Ground-, and Dragon-type Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Landorus, and Kommo-o. Ice Shard can be used to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latios and Landorus-T as well as boosted Rock Polish Landorus. Knock Off is Weavile's main Dark-type STAB move that primarily hits Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Mew and Gengar for super effective damage. It is also useful as a utility move to remove key items from certain Pokemon, such Porygon2's Eviolite and Alolan Muk's Berry. Pursuit is used to trap and punish switches from Pokemon like Latios, Mega Gallade, and Victini after a V-create.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allows Weavile to do as much damage as possible. Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Weavile to be as fast as possible, outspeeding the likes of non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Dugtrio. Life Orb allows Weavile to deal as much damage as possible while being able to switch moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As Weavile is a revenge killer, it should be sent in if a teammate has fainted or if you predict a double switch. This allows it to preserve as much of its health as possible over time, significantly increasing its longevity during battle. Try to use Knock Off as much as possible early-game to remove items like Leftovers and Eviolite from most switch-ins to Weavile. Try to use Pursuit when a Pokemon is weakened and would naturally be forced out by Weavile, such as Gallade after a Close Combat or Latios after a Draco Meteor. Avoid leaving Weavile in on Pokemon like Scizor and Nihilego, as they can take hits from Weavile and OHKO it in return with priority moves or outspeed it with Choice Scarf. Refrain from getting any status conditions on Weavile, as they will hinder its usefulness in battle drastically. Try to clear entry hazards from your side of the field before sending in Weavile, as its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and generally poor defenses don't allow it to function well with extra chip damage. You must be extra wary about how much chip damage Weavile takes; as Weavile relies on Life Orb for damage, you want to maximize the number of times it can attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye helps take hits for Weavile and reflects any incoming status moves or entry hazards thanks to Magic Bounce. It also provides a handy switch-in to Fighting-types like Mega Gallade and can use Knock Off to remove items from opposing Pokemon, making it easier for Weavile to KO them. Mandibuzz can use Defog to get rid of hazards so that Weavile can come in more often and helps defensively check threats to Weavile like Mega Scizor and Dragonite. With U-turn, it can also serve as a nice defensive pivot to safely switch Weavile into the fight. Alolan Muk takes special hits from the likes of Nihilego and Blacephelon for Weavile and also takes care of Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko for it. Tyranitar is a great asset to Weavile, as it can set Stealth Rock to chip down opposing Pokemon, allowing Weavile to revenge kill them more easily. Its Sand Stream also provides additional chip damage, and in return it appreciates Weavile's ability to check threats like Mega Gallade and Kommo-o. Similarly, Krookodile benefits Weavile with its access to Stealth Rock, and its access to Knock Off and Earthquake allows it to provide additional utility in removing items and taking out threatening Fire-types like Heatran. Mega Tyranitar also appreciates Weavile's ability to remove items from the opposing team as well as weaken certain walls, which allows it to be able to sweep much more easily late-game. Hydreigon and Greninja are both great assisting sweepers that can revenge kill threats Weavile can't, taking down threats to Weavile like Choice Scarf Excadrill with a Choice Scarf and their diverse movepool. They in turn appreciate Weavile's ability to check threats to them like Mega Gallade after a Close Combat and Landorus after a Rock Polish. Bisharp helps break through walls like Celesteela and Toxapex, which otherwise threaten Weavile immensely.</p> "

Switch in Weavile after a teammate has fainted or on a predicted double switch so that it doesn't have to take any unnecessary damage and can revenge kill fast threats with ease. Use Weavile to sweep late-game once its counters such as Scizor, Keldeo, and Alomomola are removed. When Stealth Rock is up, it is best to remove it before switching Weavile in because it lowers the number of rounds of recoil Weavile can take from Life Orb. Avoid status conditions, namely burns and paralysis, because burns halve Weavile's Attack stat, while paralysis halves its Speed. Spam Knock Off early-game to remove as many items as possible. Use Pursuit to eliminate Psychic-types and weakened Pokemon, most notably -1 Victini. Weavile should avoid staying in against priority users such as Scizor and Breloom because they can KO it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Avalugg is a solid switch-in to most physical attacks while also having access to Rapid Spin, which allows it to remove Stealth Rock. In return, Weavile can eliminate fast special attackers such as Latios and Alakazam. Kyurem-B can deal with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and some Steel-types such as Heatran with Fusion Bolt and Earth Power, respectively, while Weavile deals with bulky Psychic-types such as Mew and Jirachi. Weavile struggles against Fighting-types, so Alolan Ninetales is a great teammate because it checks Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion with Moonblast. Mamoswine and Piloswine can both set up Stealth Rock, which allows Weavile to always OHKO Jellicent and Mew. Mamoswine can also check Steel-types such as Heatran and Klefki with its Ground-type attacks. In return, Weavile checks bulky Psychic-types such as Mew and Slowbro, which can cripple Mamoswine. Both Walrein and Lapras can check Mega Scizor and can safely switch into Fire-type attacks. Lapras can also check bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Alomomola with Freeze-Dry. Weavile can trap bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew with Pursuit, which gives Cloyster more opportunities to sweep with Shell Smash.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Rock</h1> <p>Rhyperior is the best physical blanket check on Rock teams due to its fantastic HP and Defense stats and access to great coverage. With the ability Solid Rock, Rhyperior is able to absorb powerful super effective hits from various physical attackers. Access to Fire Punch and Ice Punch lets it beat physical attackers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Garchomp. Its Ground typing allows it to target threats like Excadrill and Terrakion, as well as frail Pokemon like Lopunny and Mega Sharpedo, with Earthquake. Rhyperior's high Attack stat in tandem with Weakness Policy allows it to break past defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, its poor special bulk leaves it largely susceptible to special attackers like Landorus, Latios, and Kyurem-B. Its typing gives it an extreme weakness to Grass and Water, leaving it largely threatened by Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Keldeo. As a Mega Scizor check, it faces competition from Alolan Golem, which can trap Mega Scizor with Magnet Pull before KOing it with Fire Punch and can also trap and remove many other bulky Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela. However, Rhyperior can blanket check a wider range of threats with its superior physical bulk and defensive ability.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Rock</h1> <p>Leftovers is an item option to give Rhyperior passive recovery to increase its survivability.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Rhyperior's strongest STAB move, allowing it to beat potent physical attackers like Excadrill and Terrakion. Fire Punch is important coverage, letting Rhyperior beat Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Ice Punch is another important coverage move to beat Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor as well as Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp. Rock Slide is preferred over Stone Edge for its accuracy, allowing Rhyperior to beat Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and, provided Sticky Web is up, Araquanid more consistently. Roar is another option as a means of phazing setup sweepers that Rhyperior is unable to offensively threaten, such as Mega Gallade and Mew.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense with an Impish nature makes Rhyperior as physically bulky as possible, avoiding 2HKOs from Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat and Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Earthquake. Solid Rock lets Rhyperior take less damage from super effective moves, which is especially helpful against +1 Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick and +2 Mega Scizor's Superpower. The Weakness Policy doubles Rhyperior's Attack when it's hit by a super effective move and gives it the power it needs to OHKO Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Mega Sharpedo with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>For threats such as +2 Mega Scizor and Mega Lopunny, it's best to keep Rhyperior as healthy as possible so that it can survive a hit from these threats and remove them. However, if Rhyperior does get worn down, it can still avoid a 2HKO from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Stakataka, so it can still be used to blanket check them. Because of Rhyperior's terrible Special Defense, it's best to keep it away from special attackers such as Landorus and Latios. If the Rock team already has an offensive answer to Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Excadrill such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Rhyperior can still be useful for dealing with teammates of these Pokemon like Ditto and Dugtrio. Keep Rhyperior away from status conditions such as burn and poison, since burn will make it unable to OHKO various physical attackers and poison will quickly wear it down. Rhyperior's Weakness Policy boosts will go away the moment it switches out, so make sure to know when to keep it around for Pokemon like Mega Sharpedo and Mega Lopunny. Try forcing out Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Landorus-T to double switch into another offensive Pokemon like Terrakion or Mega Diancie to gain momentum and threaten their teammates.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie can beat special wallbreakers like Keldeo and Hydreigon for Rhyperior and bounce back Toxic Spikes with Magic Bounce to keep Rhyperior healthy. Shuckle can switch into Grass-type attacks for Rhyperior thanks to its Grass neutrality. In return, Rhyperior can check Steel- and Rock-types like Excadrill and Terrakion that Shuckle can't do anything against. Terrakion appreciates Rhyperior's ability to check threatening physical attackers like Ditto and Mega Scizor so that it can sweep Normal and Steel, respectively. Tyranitar can break past physical walls like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur for Rhyperior and can beat special attackers like Latios and Greninja. Nihilego can beat Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Celebi with its Poison-type STAB attacks as well as Water-types like Mega Swampert and Suicune with its coverage moves. It can also remove Toxic Spikes to keep Rhyperior healthy. Cradily can switch into Water-type attacks for Rhyperior and can beat bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Omastar beats physical walls like Skarmory and Hippowdon after a Shell Smash and appreciates Rhyperior's ability to beat Excadrill and Dugtrio so that it can effectively sweep Ground teams.</p> "

Air Slash allows it to deal with Mega Venusaur, a Pokemon that Fairy teams struggle with because of its bulk and typing. However, Togekiss struggles to deal significant damage to some threats because its best set is focused on taking on Steel teams. Togekiss also struggles to beat Celesteela, which is being used more over Skarmory on Steel-type teams thanks to its special bulk. Furthermore, Togekiss has a hard time finding a slot on Fairy teams because Clefable fills a similar role and has access to Stealth Rock, better bulk, and the ability Magic Guard, which means it can serve as a status absorber and ignore hazards; therefore, with all these traits, it is often more useful than Togekiss in many matchups.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Togekiss is able to outspeed and revenge kill a plethora of threats such as Infernape, Greninja, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. <li>Togekiss has a solid movepool with good STAB attacks in Air Slash and Dazzling Gleam while also having great coverage options in Fire Blast and Aura Sphere to get past Steel-types.</li> <li>It also has Serene Grace, which gives Air Slash a high chance to cause foes to flinch.</li> <li>Togekiss also has support moves in Defog and Trick, which allow it to remove entry hazards and cripple special walls.</li> <li>It also has decent natural bulk, which allows it to take most attacks at full health.</li> <li>Togekiss's Fairy typing gives it a handy immunity to Dragon-type attacks while also giving it a helpful resistance to Dark-type attacks.</li> <li>However, Togekiss may be fast, but it is still outsped by faster Choice Scarf users such as Victini, Latios, and Heracross.</li> <li>Togekiss is not particularly powerful and also faces competition from Landorus-T as a Choice Scarf user.</li> <li>Togekiss is also weak to Stealth Rock, which limits the number of times it can switch in.</li> </ul> ",

Aura Sphere gives Togekiss a way to hit Heatran and Bisharp. Air Slash is key for taking on Mega Venusaur. Roost allows Togekiss to restore its health, allowing it to stay around long enough to help Fairy teams with difficult matchups like Grass and Steel.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature backed by 176 Speed EVs are used to outpace key Pokemon like Bisharp and Adamant Diggersby. 252 HP EVs is important for Togekiss to take a boosted Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor with the help of its Babiri Berry. The rest of its EVs go into Special Attack to ensure defensive Mega Scizor is taken down by Fire Blast. Serene Grace gives Air Slash more of a chance to flinch Pokemon with each hit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Togekiss to your advantage in the Steel-type matchup, as the coverage it gets from Fire Blast and Aura Sphere creates a guessing game to whether or not it will predict the switch to Heatran. Togekiss should keep itself healthy with Roost and pressure most Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory, but it has to be wary of Excadrill and Magnezone outpacing and KOing it. In the Grass-type matchup, Togekiss is able to pressure most Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn with Air Slash and Fire Blast. Keep it healthy with Roost when facing resisted attacks from Tapu Bulu, passive Pokemon like Toxapex, or a predicted switch. Togekiss should switch into resisted attacks like Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech for its teammates or attacks that Togekiss is immune to like Hippowdon's Earthquake. Air Slash can be used to wear down Pokemon that Togekiss's teammates struggle with like Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur. Try to preserve Togekiss's Babiri Berry if Mega Scizor is alive because Togekiss cannot take its boosted Bullet Punch once the Babiri Berry has been used. Be careful around common Pokemon that use status moves, as Togekiss getting burned by Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W or badly poisoned by Toxic from Chansey and Porygon2 make it difficult to keep itself healthy. Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Porygon2 and Klefki will make Togekiss unable to have a chance to outspeed anything or cause flinches with Air Slash.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko can take care of troubling Flying-types like Celesteela and Mantine that wall Togekiss and assist in pivoting to get in Togekiss on a predicted switch. Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can help deal with Rock- and Electric-type Pokemon that threaten Togekiss like Tyranitar and Tapu Koko. Tapu Bulu can also use a Swords Dance + Substitute set to help break specially defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Chansey. Azumarill can perform an important role in the Poison and Steel matchup as a wallbreaker with Z-Belly Drum; Jolly Return variants can take care of Mega Venusaur if Togekiss gets too worn down and can also help clean up in the Steel matchup after Mega Scizor is gone. Mega Diancie sets down Stealth Rock to help Togekiss wear down Mega Venusaur and can also help to keep Stealth Rock from being set thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce. Klefki can provide support in the form of Light Screen and Reflect, which can help Togekiss stay healthy longer and pressure Steel-types more safely. Klefki can also set up Spikes and slow down Pokemon with Thunder Wave, which can help Togekiss take on faster Pokemon like Latios and Greninja. Foul Play Klefki can help check Swords Dance Mega Scizor if Togekiss is unable to. Clefable can be used to set Stealth Rock to wear down Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu and soak up status for its teammates. It can also be used as a Calm Mind sweeper if Mega Diancie is already being used for Stealth Rock. Life Orb Swords Dance Mimikyu can use its Ghost-type STAB attacks to help with the Psychic matchup and take down Pokemon that Togekiss struggles with like Gengar.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Yanmega carves itself a niche on Bug-type teams as a cleaner that can do its job effectively thanks to a passable Special Attack stat and access to Speed Boost to consistently boost its Speed. Yanmega is able to use a handful of coverage moves depending on its team composition for a select few checks to Bug-type teams like Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn; unfortunately, very few of these coverage moves are strong, thus disabling it from covering multiple Pokemon at once. While Yanmega's typing is decent offensively, it's rather lacking defensively, leaving it weak to common Fire-, Electric-, Ice-, Rock-, and Flying-type moves. In particular, Stealth Rock takes away 50% of Yanmega's health because of this typing. Yanmega also has relatively poor bulk, which means that it has a hard time taking hits, even neutral or even some resisted hits.</p> ",

        "name": "Speed Boost Cleaner (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect allows Yanmega to scout for Z-Moves and guarantees that it gets a Speed boost. Air Slash is Yanmega's main Flying-type STAB move, capable of dealing massive damage to Pokemon like Kommo-o and Mega Heracross. Giga Drain allows Yanmega to bypass Pokemon that otherwise check it like Mega Diancie, Seismitoad, Mega Swampert, and Gastrodon. Bug Buzz can be used instead of Giga Drain, since it is Yanmega's strongest STAB move and allows it to bypass Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mew, but Bug-type teams don't have much trouble dealing with the teams these Pokemon are on, thus making it kind of unnecessary. Ancient Power can be used to hit Volcarona, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard Y for extra damage, all of which are threats to Bug-type teams. The reason to use Ancient Power instead of Hidden Power Rock is because of its chance to boost all Yanmega's stats, which can be quite useful at times. Hidden Power Ice allows Yanmega to beat Pokemon 4x weak to it, mainly Dragonite, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Hidden Power Fire is yet another option to hit Scizor, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, which are all capable of taking Yanmega's STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature maximizes Yanmega's offensive potential. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed certain Choice Scarf users at +1 like Heracross and Landorus-T, which it'd otherwise get outsped by. Speed Boost allows Yanmega to gain a boost in Speed every turn, allowing it to outspeed a majority of the metagame after just one turn. Life Orb further enhances Yanmega's damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Yanmega is best used as a late-game cleaner to cleave through the opposing team once it is weakened. Be mindful when using Protect, since other setup sweepers like Volcarona might benefit from this turn to set up for themselves. It's best to not switch Yanmega in on Stealth Rock so Yanmega can switch in more times during the match, and it's best to keep Yanmega as healthy as possible in general, especially if the opposing team has a priority user. Yanmega's bulk is pretty bad, so it should avoid directly switching in on an attack in general; it's best to bring Yanmega in via a fainted teammate, on a double switch, or via a slower U-turn from teammates like Mega Scizor. Yanmega can also be brought in on Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Quagsire, which tend to have a passive nature. Try to avoid getting paralyzed, because this makes Yanmega rely on Speed boosts too much. Use Yanmega's coverage moves to hit what is on the opposing side of the field, as it is generally ineffective to predict with Yanmega. It should also be considered if it is actually worth it to reveal Yanmega's coverage moves early-game, since the opponent might scout for it, and knowing Yanmega's coverage moves allows them to play around it accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>When using Yanmega, entry hazard removal Pokemon like Armaldo and Forretress are required because of its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Armaldo and Forretress are both also capable of setting up hazards, allowing Yanmega to get KOs more easily. Assault Vest Araquanid is a good teammate because it can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks with relative ease for Yanmega thanks to its ability Water Bubble. Galvantula is capable of setting up Sticky Web for Yanmega, which allows it to outspeed more Pokemon and be less reliant on Speed Boost, as well as threatening Flying-types with its STAB Electric-type attacks. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Choice Scarf Heracross can be useful if Yanmega is lacking Bug Buzz, as they are capable of dealing with Psychic-, Dark-, and Rock-types, which Yanmega tends to struggle against. Yanmega also appreciates Pokemon that are able to dispose of Steel-types, since it has a hard time dealing with them; Volcarona, Buzzwole, Heracross, Mega Heracross, and Mega Pinsir are capable of doing so. Pokemon that can weaken walls like Mega Pinsir, Volcarona, Mega Heracross, and Mega Scizor are very useful for Yanmega, as they ease its job to clean up.</p> "

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Gliscor is a fantastic wall thanks to its great natural bulk, access to reliable recovery, and ability to act as a status absorber thanks to Poison Heal. This allows it to act as a blanket check to tons of threats to Flying teams such as Latios, by being able to switch into its Draco Meteor, and Zeraora, which it walls. Its Ground typing provides Flying teams with an immunity to Electric-type coverage and a neutrality to Stealth Rock, which allows Gliscor to become an excellent Defogger for the type. With access to Taunt, Gliscor can act as a stallbreaker by preventing walls such as Chansey from recovering health and slowly wearing them down with Earthquake while also being able to prevent Pokemon such as Hippowdon from setting up Stealth Rock. However, while Gliscor brings all these amazing attributes to the team, it stacks the type's natural weakness to Ice-type coverage and can be taken advantage by faster setup sweepers such as Mega Latias.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Gliscor's good bulk and movepool let it serve as an effective stallbreaker and defensive pivot on Ground teams. Poison Heal is a great defensive ability that allows Gliscor to avoid harmful status such as burns and heals 1/8 of its health every turn after it has been poisoned by a Toxic Orb. These traits allow it to switch into passive walls like Mantine and Celesteela and threaten them with Taunt. Gliscor is also one of the best users of Knock Off on Ground teams, helping remove items like Eviolite to make certain Pokemon like Chansey easier to break past. While Gliscor's secondary Flying typing grants it a useful neutrality to Grass-type attacks, it also burdens it with a 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, letting Pokemon that have Ice-type coverage such as Porygon-Z and Kyurem-B easily force it out. In addition, Gliscor's only decent bulk means powerful wallbreakers like Mega Gallade and Hydreigon can punch through it with little issue.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p>Knock Off allows Gliscor to break walls better by removing their item, such as Chansey's Eviolite. Stealth Rock can also be run to free up a slot for other teammates such as Mega Aerodactyl. However, running Knock Off or Stealth Rock means forgoing Taunt, which would let walls easily recover damage on it and make Gliscor far too passive. Gliscor can also run Toxic, which allows it to stallbreak better alongside Taunt to chip walls such as Mandibuzz faster. However, this means giving up Defog, which is required to give Flying teams a better chance in the Electric matchup. Swords Dance can be run instead of a stallbreaker set, allowing it to become a threatening setup sweeper with a host of different options such as Ice Fang to take on other Flying teams better, Knock Off to remove walls items and hit Psychic-type Pokemon like Latios, or Facade to take advantage of its permanent status condition.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Gliscor can opt to run Swords Dance over Taunt to still be able to muscle past bulky walls while also being less passive against offensive threats. Facade is an option over Knock Off on these sets to hit Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Breloom hard after a Swords Dance boost. However, this set doesn't have the benefits of denying entry hazards and recovery with Taunt and is less consistent against bulky phazers such as Swampert. A moveset of Earthquake or Knock Off, Substitute, Protect, and Toxic can make Gliscor a menace against types like Psychic, being able to stall out foes effectively thanks to Poison Heal. However, this set is either utterly walled by Celesteela when running Earthquake or very passive and exploitable when running Knock Off.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-type Pokemon such as Weavile and Mamoswine threaten to OHKO Gliscor with their STAB attacks. Kyurem-B is especially threatening because of its additional coverage in Fusion Bolt, allowing it to hit the entire Flying team for super effective damage.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Offensive Water-type Pokemon such as Keldeo threaten to OHKO Gliscor with Hydro Pump, while more defensive Water-type Pokemon such as Mantine and Swampert can threaten to burn Gliscor with Scald before it has been badly poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Foes: Due to Gliscor's only attack being Earthquake, all Flying-type Pokemon and those with the ability Levitate such as Hydreigon and Celesteela completely wall Gliscor. Rotom-W especially annoys Gliscor, as it can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp before being badly poisoned and can do lots of damage with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite and Mega Sharpedo can easily break past Gliscor's defenses and threaten to do tons of damage to it or outright OHKO it with their powerful STAB and coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users: Faster Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Crobat can prevent Gliscor from performing many of roles, such as clearing hazards with Defog or recovering health with Roost.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks: Gliscor has a crippling 4x weakness to Ice-type moves, which allows foes with Ice-type coverage such as Porygon2 and Tapu Koko to heavily damage or OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Though weak Water-types like Gastrodon and Toxapex cannot 2HKO Gliscor thanks to Poison Heal, more offensive Water-type attackers like Gyarados and Keldeo can outspeed and blow past Gliscor. Gliscor also fears Scald burns before its Toxic Orb is activated, which cripple it severely.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Gliscor's only above-average bulk means powerful wallbreakers like Diggersby and Dragonite can 2HKO it with their STAB moves, making it unable to switch into them.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Gliscor is completely crippled by Trick giving it a Choice item due to it being very exploitable when locked into a single move and completely unable to stallbreak effectively.

      {
        "name": "Defog (Flying)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Defog gives Gliscor a means to clear the field of Stealth Rock. Earthquake is Gliscor's only attack, allowing it to take on weakened Pokemon such as Chansey and OHKO Pokemon such as Lucario. Roost allows Gliscor to stay healthy through the match, allowing it to constantly switch into weak attacks. Taunt makes Gliscor an excellent stallbreaker alongside Roost, preventing walls like Chansey from recovering off damage while slowly wearing them down with Earthquake.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 HP and 20 Def EVs allow Gliscor to take Choice Band Victini's V-create and maximize the recovery it gets from Poison Heal. 120 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature allow Gliscor to outspeed Pokemon up to Heatran and Jolly Diggersby. The rest is invested into Special Defense to maximize its ability to switch into special attacks, such as Choice Scarf Latios's Draco Meteor. Toxic Orb restores Gliscor's health via Poison Heal allowing it to function as a wall better and act as a status absorber for the team. Gliscor can also run a bulkier spread with 56 Speed EVs to still outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Bisharp, with the rest dumped into Special Defense alongside a Careful nature to almost always avoid a 2HKO from Mega Diancie's Moonblast. However, Flying teams appreciate Gliscor's ability to outspeed Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Gliscor relies on Poison Heal to stay healthy through the game, you should try to position yourself where Gliscor can safely switch in and get badly poisoned through Toxic Orb. Once poisoned, Gliscor can act as a status absorber and should be switched into status moves such as Celesteela's Toxic and Mega Sableye's Will-O-Wisp. However, Gliscor should not be directly switched into any Pokemon that could potentially cripple it with a burn before it has been poisoned, as that invalidates Gliscor. Similarly, it is important to not allow its item to be removed with Knock Off until after it has been badly poisoned. After getting badly poisoned, Gliscor should be used to switch into weaker Knock Off attacks from Pokemon such as Mew and Mega Sableye, and it should also use the free switch in as an opportunity to clear Stealth Rock with Defog. Gliscor should constantly be kept as healthy as possible, so it can switch into attacks such as Victini's V-create. Look for opportunities to use Taunt to prevent other walls such as Chansey and Cradily from recovering off damage by removing their ability to recover or set up Stealth Rock. Due to Gliscor's Electric immunity, it should be switched into Electric-type attackers such as Zapdos than can't threaten it. Gliscor should absolutely be preserved in the Electric matchup, as it not only provides an immunity against their STAB moves but also acts as a great late-game wincon, being able to take on attackers such as Zeraora and Alolan Raichu.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of its teammates appreciate the Electric-type immunity Gliscor provides, as well as its ability to absorb status and switch into Knock Off after it has been poisoned and clear entry hazards with Defog. Celesteela can take on troublesome Ice-types such as Weavile and Alolan Ninetales for Gliscor by providing it with neutrality to the type while also being able to OHKO them with Heavy Slam. Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Landorus-T help keep faster foes in check, being able to outspeed threatening Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu outside of Electric Terrain while also being able to set Stealth Rock. Mega Aerodactyl also can Pursuit trap threats such as Victini for Gliscor, alleviating some pressure off it. Mantine provides a neutrality to Ice-type attacks and immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to easily switch into Pokemon that threaten Gliscor such as Greninja. It also forms the best Defog core with Gliscor, as they can clear hazards against every type due to their strong defensive synergy, as well as alleviating the pressure for Gliscor to deal with special attackers like the aforementioned Latios. Zapdos appreciates Gliscor to act as the team's Defogger, allowing it to run better sets such as SubToxic. Gliscor in return appreciates Zapdos's ability to cripple walls such as Hippowdon with Toxic, allowing it to more effectively stallbreak alongside Taunt. Tornadus-T can take on Pokemon that Gliscor struggles against such as Mega Venusaur thanks to its strong Flying-type STAB coverage. It can also bring in Gliscor safely with U-turn against Pokemon it can wall such as Zapdos, allowing it to recover off damage with Roost or Defog with ease. Mega Charizard Y can break past defensive walls such as Mega Venusaur, which Gliscor can struggle to beat even with access to Taunt. It can also break past Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon with Solar Beam.</p> "

        "name": "Stallbreaker (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Gliscor's strongest and only STAB move, being able to deal consistent damage to threats that are not immune to it. Roost allows Gliscor to keep itself healthy so it can effectively switch into attacks throughout the battle. Taunt helps Gliscor to stallbreak, preventing passive walls like Skarmory from healing themselves or laying entry hazards. Knock Off provides utility by removing items such as Dragonite's Choice Band and Chansey's Eviolite so they can be dealt with more easily. It also can hit key Ground-immune targets like Celesteela and Air Balloon Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 HP EVs in conjunction with 32 Defense EVs allow Gliscor to always avoid a 2HKO from Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech after Stealth Rock while also maximizing its recovery from Poison Heal. 112 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Gliscor outspeed threats such as Adamant Diggersby and Timid Heatran, letting it check them more effectively. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to take special hits such as Latios's Draco Meteor more easily. Alternatively, more EVs can be moved from Special Defense to Speed to hit certain benchmarks, such as 120 Speed to outspeed Jolly Diggersby, and 176 Speed to outspeed Nidoking and Suicune. Toxic Orb combined with Poison Heal allows Gliscor to heal 1/8 of its health per turn while also making it immune to harmful status after it has activated.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gliscor should be brought in on passive walls like Celesteela and proceed to use Taunt to prevent them from healing and slowly whittle them down. It's important to be careful before Gliscor's Toxic Orb has activated to avoid getting it burned by Will-O-Wisp or Scald users such as Mega Sableye and Swampert, respectively. This risk can be avoided if Gliscor comes via a double switch when your opponent is likely to switch out. Once it is poisoned, Gliscor can effectively be used as a status absorber for the team, being able to switch into Toxic or Will-O-Wisp aimed for a teammate like Gastrodon. Gliscor also makes for a good pivot into Knock Off due to it not needing Toxic Orb after it has activated. Since opponents might try to predict Gliscor using Taunt and directly bring in an offensive check like Greninja, it is sometimes worthwhile to try to predict this and attack them on the switch in. Knock Off is a good move to spam early-game, as removing Leftovers or Eviolite from defensive walls like Staraptor and Chansey makes them easier to wear down and break past for Gliscor's teammates. Taunt can sometimes allow Gliscor to stall out the PP of walls with one attacking move, such as Ferrothorn, forcing them to use Struggle. However, Gliscor can also be stalled out of Taunt PP if the opponent switches between their Pokemon repeatedly and Stealth Rock is not up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gliscor's decent bulk and ability to take advantage of and shut down passive walls let it fit onto many Ground teams. Gastrodon and Seismitoad make for great defensive partners due to their typing and abilities granting them an Ice-neutrality and a Water immunity, covering both of Gliscor's weaknesses. Gastrodon can reliably switch into threats like Choice Specs Keldeo and Choice Scarf Greninja thanks to Recover, while Seismitoad has the ability to outspeed and KO Belly Drum Azumarill. In exchange, Gliscor can switch into Toxic from walls like Chansey as well as take on Grass-types like Cradily. Landorus is a good offensive partner for Gliscor that is able to deal with Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks with Gravity, as well as outpace threats such as Kyurem-B. In return, Gliscor can weaken special walls that give it trouble such as Mantine. Garchomp and Mega Garchomp are powerful wallbreakers that can use Swords Dance to break foes like Swampert. With Gliscor supporting them by relieving pressure from them dealing with walls, they can break the majority of balanced cores in the metagame. Mega Garchomp also can choose to run a mixed wallbreaking set that can threaten types like Water and Flying with its broad coverage, being able to hit Mantine with Stone Edge and Celesteela with Fire Blast. Excadrill with Hippowdon to provide Sand Stream support forms a core that can revenge kill and clean weakened threats such as Keldeo while also providing entry hazards and phazing support. In exchange, Gliscor can deal with bulky Flying-types such as Staraptor, which can otherwise can switch into both Hippowdon and Excadrill. Excadrill can also check Ice-types like Alolan Ninetales with a STAB Iron Head. Mega Steelix serves as a good defensive partner for Gliscor, boasting great mixed bulk and a valuable Ice-neutrality that allow it to take on huge threats like Belly Drum Azumarill, Tapu Bulu, and Kyurem-B, as well as being able to serve as a wincon with Curse to threaten types like Fairy and Dragon. Gliscor can support it by dealing with its checks such as Zapdos. Dugtrio can trap huge threats to Gliscor such as Greninja and Kyurem-B thanks to Arena Trap and a Focus Sash. Gliscor's Taunt helps make this easier by preventing hazards from common setters such as Ferrothorn. Mamoswine is a powerful wallbreaker that appreciates Gliscor's ability to soften up teams to make switching into it more difficult. In return, it provides a unique Ice-type resistance for Ground-teams as well as strong priority Ice Shard to pick off threats like Hydreigon and Tapu Bulu and Icicle Crash to threaten Flying teams.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Mamoswine functions as a powerful physical wallbreaker thanks to its incredible Attack stat, as well as its unique and nearly unresisted STAB combination. Notably, Mamoswine is the only viable Ground-type with access to a STAB boosted priority move in Ice Shard. This assists Ground teams by granting them the ability to revenge kill faster, weakened foes such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Mamoswine also is incredibly useful for sweeping Dragon and Flying teams late-game, as both types struggle to switch into Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB moves. Because of Thick Fat, Mamoswine can offensively check foes with Ice-type coverage such as Alolan Ninetales for Ground teams. However, Mamoswine's typing is defensively terrible and leaves it susceptible to various types such as Steel and Water. Additionally, foes with type coverage such as Close Combat Zeraora can OHKO Mamoswine. Also, while powerful, Mamoswine has a predictable moveset that can be played around if pressured correctly. Despite Mamoswine being a powerful wallbreaker, physically defensive walls such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro can tank its attacks and can recover their health.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>Mamoswine is a staple pick for Ice teams due to its ability to effectively fill multiple roles, including a Stealth Rock user, Choice Scarf revenge killer, and wallbreaker. Its high Attack stat and Ground typing allow it to check many Fire- and Steel-type threats such as Torkoal, Heatran, and Magnezone. Its Ground typing also grants it a neutrality to Stealth Rock, which can allow it to switch in more often. Its solid offensive presence makes it one of the best Stealth Rock users for Ice teams. With the ability Thick Fat, Mamoswine can offer a Fire neutrality for Ice teams, and with Oblivious, suicide lead sets can negate Taunt users to freely set up Stealth Rock. Access to priority in Ice Shard allows it to pick off weakened threats. Mamoswine has a wide range of coverage attacks, including Stone Edge, Superpower, and Knock Off, which allow it hit Flying-, Normal-, and Psychic-types such as Mantine, Chansey, and Slowbro, respectively. With Endeavor and Ice Shard along with a Focus Sash, Mamoswine is capable of blanket checking important threats such as Mega Scizor, Choice-locked Keldeo, and Volcarona. With a Choice Scarf, Mamoswine can operate as an effective revenge killer capable of checking threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Koko, and Nihilego. Unfortunately, Mamoswine is susceptible to being walled by Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Slowbro. Its mediocre Speed stat makes it incredibly easy to revenge kill. Its Ice / Ground typing leaves it weak to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Bullet Punch. Even with a Choice Scarf, Mamoswine finds itself outsped by common Choice Scarf Pokemon like Victini, Terrakion, and Heracross.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p>A Life Orb can be utilized over Choice Band, as it allows Mamoswine to freely switch moves. Additionally, it is recommended to use Knock Off over Superpower on such a set in order to remain as powerful as possible. However, the loss in power means Mamoswine misses out on some notable 2HKOs, namely on Celesteela and Ferrothorn. It also forces Mamoswine to take recoil after using a move, which is especially detrimental against Flying teams, where it needs to be healthy in order to break them down. A Choice Scarf can be used over Choice Band to threaten faster foes such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Choice Scarf Magnezone, but this comes at the cost of the power attained from a Choice Band.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>Ice Shard can be used on Choice Scarf sets as a means of revenge killing priority users like Breloom as well as faster Choice Scarf Pokemon like Latios, Hydreigon, and Landorus-T. However, the coverage offered by Superpower and Knock Off is much more valuable. Rock Slide can be run over Stone Edge on Choice Scarf sets for more consistency, but it can't always 2HKO Mantine and Armaldo. Stone Edge can be run on wallbreaking sets as a means of hitting Water-types like Pelipper and Araquanid. However, Knock Off and Superpower are generally better coverage options. Stealth Rock can be used on the wallbreaking set to take advantage of how Mamoswine can force switches. However, without Superpower, Mamoswine won't be able to threaten Air Balloon Heatran.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Rotom-W: Rotom-W is the single best counter to Mamoswine. It resists Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB moves, is immune to its Ground-type STAB moves, and can burn it through Will-O-Wisp or outright KO it with Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Greninja and Suicune can threaten Mamoswine with their STAB moves or a potential Scald burn. They also resist Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Buzzwole and Mega Gallade can threaten to KO Mamoswine with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Burns severely hinder Mamoswine by halving its Attack stat and softening its damage output.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Mega Slowbro and Skarmory are a few examples of physically defensive walls that can take Mamoswine's attacks and recover any damage taken.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Terrakion, Heracross, and Keldeo outspeed Mamoswine and threaten to KO it with their Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Greninja, Mega Sharpedo, and Manaphy outspeed Mamoswine and threaten it with their Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fast Steel-types: Choice Scarf Steel-types like Excadrill and Jirachi are capable of outspeeding and KOing Mamoswine.

        "name": "Choice Band (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Icicle Crash is Mamoswine's best Ice-type STAB move that reliably damages bulky Flying-types such as Zapdos and Mantine, and it also has a chance to make the foe flinch. Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types such as Jirachi and Metagross. Ice Shard is a priority move that allows Mamoswine to check setup sweepers such as Landorus-T and Mega Latias. It can also be used to revenge kill weakened foes, especially those faster than Mamoswine such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Superpower is a good coverage move against Normal- and Steel-types such as Porygon2 and Air Balloon Heatran. Alternatively, Knock Off helps against physically defensive walls such as Porygon2 and Slowbro by hampering their defenses and recovery, respectively, as well as providing coverage against Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment paired with a Choice Band makes Mamoswine a threatening physical wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Mamoswine to outspeed some of its offensive checks, such as Breloom and Tapu Bulu without Choice Scarf. Thick Fat helps against Fire-types such as Heatran and Victini by weakening their Fire-type STAB moves and allowing Mamoswine to revenge kill them. An Adamant nature can be used as a means of attaining extra power, but this comes at the cost of extra Speed attained from a Jolly nature, as it no longer outspeeds Jolly Breloom and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep Mamoswine as healthy as possible against Flying teams, as it can reliably damage Pokemon such as Celesteela and Gliscor without having to rely on Gravity Landorus. It also is crucial against Dragon teams thanks to its priority Ice Shard to revenge kill faster Dragon-types such as Kommo-o and Latios, while Icicle Crash can OHKO or 2HKO all of them. Because Mamoswine is holding a Choice Band, it must be careful of what move it chooses to lock itself into, as it should try to predict what the foe will do. Use Mamoswine to offensively check foes with Ice-type coverage such as Greninja and Thundurus-T, as Thick Fat helps to lessen the damage. However, be cautious of other options from these foes, as they may predict Mamoswine switching in and deal severe damage to it. Knock Off can be used early-game against Eviolite users such as Chansey and Porygon2 to allow teammates such as Excadrill and Landorus to deal heavier damage to them. Additionally, removing the foe's items will decrease their overall usefulness. Mamoswine must be careful of using Superpower, as the drops in its Attack and Defense stats can make it setup bait for foes such as Volcarona and Swords Dance Mega Scizor. Avoid burns as much as possible, as they severely compromise Mamoswine's ability to break teams.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus holds incredible wallbreaking power on Ground teams thanks to its Life Orb and Sheer Force combination, being able to break physically defensive foes such as Porygon2 and Slowbro for Mamoswine. Additionally, Landorus aids Mamoswine by providing Gravity support to let it spam Earthquake to take care of checks such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Skarmory while also being able to use its coverage moves such as Focus Blast and Sludge Wave to threaten some of Mamoswine's checks such as Porygon2 and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Gastrodon and Seismitoad are the two viable Ground-types that compensate for Mamoswine's Water-type weakness by providing an immunity, though they serve different purposes. Gastrodon's access to Recover and good bulk make it a fabulous defensive check to foes such as Greninja and Suicune. Seismitoad, however, doesn't have reliable recovery but makes up for it by outspeeding and KOing Azumarill after a Belly Drum boost, which would otherwise pose a threat to Ground teams. Hippowdon's solid physical bulk, Slack Off recovery, and access to Whirlwind are used to handle physical setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor for Mamoswine. The sand that Hippowdon provides also chips away at foes and puts them in range of being KOed by Mamoswine. Sand Rush Excadrill works in tandem with Hippowdon by becoming a powerful revenge killer under sand and checks fast threats to Mamoswine such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu, and Zeraora, while it's also able to clear away entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Garchomp's typing is useful, as it provides a neutrality to Grass- and Water- type moves from Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Mantine for Mamoswine and uses its solid Speed tier and Swords Dance boosts to break them down. Alternatively, Mega Garchomp becomes immensely powerful and assists Mamoswine by using its mixed coverage to break down physical walls such as Celesteela and Skarmory with Fire Blast and also checks Azumarill after a Belly Drum boost. Mega Steelix assists Mamoswine by checking physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, Tapu Bulu thanks to its incredible defenses, and even survives Adamant Azumarill's +6 Aqua Jet to KO it in return with Heavy Slam. Mega Steelix and Mamoswine also create a solid core that effectively breaks down Dragon teams.</p> "

A Focus Sash is used to guarantee that Mamoswine survives any hit and can safely put up Stealth Rock, as well as reducing the opposing Pokemon's HP to 1 with Endeavor. 0 IVs in HP are used in order to have as few HP as possible, allowing Mamoswine to use Endeavor more effectively even when it hasn't been attacked. The ability Oblivious is used to get past Taunt users that prevent Mamoswine from getting up Stealth Rock like Deoxys-S.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine should be led with most of the time in order to get up Stealth Rock as quickly as possible. However, you do have to be careful when leading against entry hazard removers like Torkoal and Armaldo. If there's a threat that Mamoswine needs its Focus Sash to handle, make sure to preserve it by switching it out. Keep hazards off the field as much as possible, since they can break Mamoswine's Focus Sash. If hazards can't be prevented, try switching Mamoswine in as the opponent goes for Stealth Rock in order to keep Mamoswine's Focus Sash intact. It's a good idea to bring in a weakened Mamoswine against a slower threat such as Celesteela in order to chip away at it with Endeavor. Avoid burns and poison as much as possible, since both break Mamoswine's Focus Sash and burns also cripple it by halving its Attack. After getting up Stealth Rock, it's a good idea to preserve Mamoswine, since it'll still be able to check Pokemon such as Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Everything on Ice appreciates Mamoswine's Stealth Rock and ability to blanket check various threats, including Volcarona and Mega Scizor, with Endeavor and Ice Shard. Kyurem-B can break through walls such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Mega Venusaur, which Mamoswine can't do good damage against. Kyurem-B also offers helpful Grass and Water resistances, which Mamoswine greatly appreciates. Alolan Ninetales can check Water- and Fighting-types that give Mamoswine trouble like Swampert, Keldeo, and Terrakion. In return, Mamoswine checks Fire-types like Alolan Marowak and Heatran as well as Steel-types like Magnezone and Bisharp. Cloyster is a powerful setup sweeper that appreciates Mamoswine's Stealth Rock enabling it to break through Sturdy Pokemon like Skarmory and Forretress. Lapras offers a helpful Water immunity with Water Absorb as well as a Steel neutrality for Mamoswine. It also serves as a helpful check to Mega Scizor and Azumarill with Hidden Power Fire and Freeze-Dry, respectively, and it can use Mamoswine's Stealth Rock to guarantee an OHKO on Rotom-W with Choice Specs Freeze-Dry. Avalugg can remove hazards with Rapid Spin to preserve Mamoswine's Focus Sash and switch into threats like Jirachi, Heracross, and Terrakion. In return, Mamoswine complements Avalugg's phazing with Stealth Rock. Alolan Sandslash is an effective cleaner that can remove hazards with Rapid Spin to preserve Mamoswine's Focus Sash. It's also capable of checking threats such as non-Choice Scarf Terrakion and Hasty Victini after Stealth Rock damage. Weavile can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini, Jirachi, and Gengar while also removing items with Knock Off and using Mamoswine's Stealth Rock to guarantee KOs against Mega Charizard Y and Heatran.</p> "

  "Porygon-Z": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Porygon-Z is one of the best stat boosters available to Normal thanks to Z-Conversion giving it +1 in all stats; it can prove to be an amazing sweeper when utilized late-game. Z-Conversion allows Porygon-Z to change its typing, which can prove invaluable in certain matchups. Notably, turning into Ghost provides an important Fighting immunity. This is complemented by great Special Attack and coverage moves, most notably BoltBeam, allowing it to hit a large majority of Pokemon at least neutrally. BoltBeam coverage enables Porygon-Z to blast through the Flying matchup, cleanly sweeping through entire Flying-type teams after a Z-Conversion. Adaptability further enhances Porygon-Z's ability to act as a sweeper after setting up by boosting its Shadow Ball's power even further. It also has access to Recover, which gives it sustain after receiving its stat boosts, granting it longevity throughout the battle. However, Porygon-Z generally relies on its stat boosting to be threatening in a battle, and its only mediocre bulk and Speed leave it vulnerable to faster attackers such as Landorus and Keldeo, therefore limiting its ability to set up and sweep. Its mediocre Speed also leaves it susceptible to powerful Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Greninja and Victini even after Z-Conversion. Porygon-Z also relies on its teammates to weaken foes and eliminate its checks prior to setting up in order to sweep teams. While gaining +1 in all stats can be game changing, Porygon-Z can only do so once, so choosing the right time to do so is crucial in a battle. On balance-oriented teams, Porygon-Z has a hard time fitting onto a team, as it typically competes for the same slot as the amazing physical wallbreaker Diggersby.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Utilizing Thunderbolt in the first slot enables Porygon-Z to changes its typing to Electric following Z-Conversion, which is helpful in preventing Porygon-Z from being paralyzed as well as helping immensely in the Steel matchup. However, it loses out on the important Fighting immunity that the Ghost typing grants and becomes unable to take advantage of Shadow Ball's general lack of Pokemon that resist it. This set should also utilize Hidden Power Fire over Shadow Ball to help take down troublesome Steel-types such as Excadrill after prior chip damage. Nasty Plot could be utilized to bolster Porygon-Z's Special Attack to tremendous levels, allowing it to blast through even most of its common defensive checks. However, without Z-Conversion, Porygon-Z lacks the Speed necessary to handle its common offensive checks.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Alolan Muk are able to absorb attacks from a boosted Porygon-Z and whittle it down with status while taking little damage from its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Bisharp resist Porygon-Z's primary attack in Shadow Ball and prevent it from utilizing Z-Conversion effectively. They also threaten Porygon-Z after it sets up due to resisting Shadow Ball and being able to hit back hard with Dark-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Porygon-Z's awkward Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to most common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini and Blacephalon, which can revenge kill it even after a Z-Conversion boost.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phazing Moves: Pokemon that threaten to remove Porygon-Z's stat boosts with Haze, such as Toxapex, or moves like Whirlwind and Roar, such as Swampert, effectively nullify Porygon-Z's sweeping ability, as it can only set up once.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Paralysis completely inhibits Porygon-Z's ability to sweep opposing teams due to the drop in Speed, which makes it unable to outspeed most offensive Pokemon.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball becomes Porygon-Z's most spammable move after utilizing Z-Conversion thanks to Adaptability and being able to hit the vast majority of types neutrally. Conversion is utilized in combination with Normalium Z to boost all of Porygon-Z's stats by 1 and change its typing to its first-in-slot move. Thunderbolt is a fantastic coverage move, being able to super effectively threaten Flying- and Water-types such as Mantine and Celesteela. Recover grants Porygon-Z a means of reliable recovery, which grants Porygon-Z longevity throughout the battle, minimizing its reliance on avoiding chip damage. Alternatively, Ice Beam is amazing in combination with Thunderbolt to threaten a large number of Pokemon, most notably Ground- and Dragon-types such as Diggersby, Garchomp, and Dragonite.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature maximize Porygon-Z's offensive presence and Speed, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Mega Altaria and Gyarados as well as common Choice Scarf Pokemon like Excadrill when at +1. Normalium Z enables Porygon-Z to use Z-Conversion, which boosts all of its stats by 1 and changes its typing to Ghost. Adaptability maximizes Porygon-Z's STAB attack damage, boosting Shadow Ball after Porygon-Z uses Z-Conversion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Porygon-Z works best as a late-game sweeper after its faster checks, such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Sand Rush Excadrill, have been eliminated. Weaken Porygon-Z's defensive checks such as Toxapex and Tyranitar prior to setting up so it can easily clean through the remaining team. Take advantage of Ghost's immunity to Fighting to mitigate the threat of offensive Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion after Porygon-Z changes its type through Z-Conversion. Porygon-Z has mediocre bulk, so it should avoid switching into attacks. In the same vein, because Porygon-Z can only set up once, it should look for opportune times to set up its Z-Conversion to not be overly weakened or KOed on its setup turn. Take advantage of Porygon-Z's ability to force switches by using Recover to heal up any lost health while its checks are still healthy, prior to using Z-Conversion to prolong Porygon-Z's life throughout the battle. Recover should also be utilized after it gains its stat boosts in order to heal back chip damage that defensive Pokemon deal out in an effort to wear Porygon-Z down. Utilizing Recover correctly will also help bring Porygon-Z out of range of common priority users' attacks such as Bullet Punch from Scizor. Do not set up against Pokemon that commonly run Haze or phazing moves, such as Mantine and Hippowdon, as setting up on them can lead to the stat boosts being removed, wasting Porygon-Z's Z-Move. Porygon-Z should be wary of status effects and entry hazards, as they all wear it down, leaving it vulnerable to faster revenge killers and minimizing its ability to set up effectively. Paralysis prevents Porygon-Z from effectively performing its job as a late-game sweeper, as it relies on outspeeding threats to eliminate them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey supports Porygon-Z by utilizing both Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave helps slow down opposing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion, which gives Porygon-Z more opportunities to set up and the ability to outspeed its common checks, and Stealth Rock chips down opposing Pokemon and enables Porygon-Z to more easily sweep through weakened foes late-game. Porygon2 forms an amazing defensive core with Chansey and supports Porygon-Z thanks to Toxic, further whittling down opposing Pokemon into KO range from Porygon-Z late-game. Staraptor removes entry hazards from the field for Porygon-Z and lowers opposing Pokemon's Attack stats with Intimidate, allowing it to act as a physical wall. It also can act as a pivot with U-turn to bring Porygon-Z in safely to begin its sweep. Ditto helps check opposing setup sweepers and faster offensive Pokemon for Porygon-Z, granting it more opportunities to sweep late-game. Mega Lopunny and Diggersby are both offensive powerhouses that can help take down common special walls and Dark-types that check Porygon-Z such as Alolan Muk, Chansey, and Bisharp. Smeargle sets Sticky Web for Porygon-Z, which on more offensively oriented teams allows Porygon-Z to effectively outspeed all grounded Pokemon after a Z-Conversion boost. Additionally, Smeargle can spread both sleep and paralysis between Spore and Nuzzle, giving Porygon-Z more opportunities to set up safely.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fire</h1> <p>Rotom-H is an excellent utility Pokemon on Fire-type teams due to its access to both Defog and dual screens, allowing teammates such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona to set up more easily. A slow Volt Switch allows it to pivot in its teammates to gain momentum and take advantage of its screens and Defog support as well as to chip down annoying Water- and Flying-types such as Suicune and Mantine, which can be somewhat troublesome for Fire-type teams. Levitate grants Rotom-H a Ground-type immunity, which bolsters its supportive and defensive capabilities. This also gives Rotom-H more opportunities to set screens, Defog away entry hazards, and generate momentum by switching in on Pokemon locked into a Ground-type attack such as Choice Band Excadrill. Rotom-H's Electric typing gives it useful resistances to Flying- and Electric-type attacks, allowing it to switch into Staraptor's Brave Bird for Volcarona or Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt for Mega Charizard Y. Unfortunately, its lack of reliable recovery leaves it very easily chipped down throughout the match, hindering its capabilities of fulfilling its supportive role. Rotom-H also relies on its weak Volt Switch to dish out damage to foes, leaving it susceptible to being taken advantage of by setup sweepers that take neutral damage from it or are immune to the move such as Landorus-T, Mega Latias, Kommo-o, and Mega Tyranitar. It receives competition from Torkoal as a hazard remover, but while Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock for the team, Rotom-H has access to the dual screens that Torkoal lacks. Rotom-H and Torkoal can, however, be used on the same team, as they can fulfill different roles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p>Rotom-H can use a set of Will-O-Wisp / Defog / Volt Switch / Overheat with Leftovers, allowing it to cripple the other team with Will-O-Wisp and switch into hazards more times; however, the lack of dual screen support gives setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X less opportunities to set up. Overheat allows Rotom-H to hit Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus, which it could not with Volt Switch. Leftovers sets can also run Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats, allowing the team's wallbreakers and sweepers to clean late-game with ease. Choice Scarf allows it to take on a more offensive pivot role with Overheat / Volt Switch / Hidden Power Ice / Defog. A Choice Scarf set lures in typical checks such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, which can usually use Rotom-H as setup fodder, and heavily damage them with Hidden Power Ice. However, Pokemon such as Infernape, Blacephalon, and Victini are much better Choice Scarf Pokemon for Fire-type teams, while Rotom-H is better used with a utility set.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Fast Water-types: Water-type Pokemon such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Kingdra threaten Rotom-H's ability to clear hazards and set up screens due to their naturally higher Speed and are able to OHKO Rotom-H with their Water-type STAB attacks, though they fail to do so in the sun. Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Seismitoad are especially annoying, as they not only outspeed Rotom-H and OHKO it with their strong STAB attacks but also can continually set up Stealth Rock in front of it without fearing Volt Switch. However, Mega Swampert should scout for Rotom-H variants with Will-O-Wisp before it tries to set up Stealth Rock in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon are immune to Rotom-H's only attacking move in Volt Switch, allowing them to freely come in and continually set up Stealth Rock or force Rotom-H out with their powerful attacks. Garchomp and Excadrill can both easily set up Swords Dance in front of Rotom-H and OHKO it with a boosted Devastating Drake or Rock Slide, respectively. Landorus can use Rotom-H to set up a free Gravity, allowing it to threaten every switch-in with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Offensive Rock-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion outspeed Rotom-H and threaten to OHKO it with their strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Defog: Defog users such as Latios and Mew can clear the field of the screens Rotom-H sets. Gliscor and Landorus-T can also Defog away screens and are immune to Rotom-H's Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Since Rotom-H is reliant on support moves to benefit the team, Pokemon such as Tapu Koko that carry Taunt completely shut it down. However, Taunt users can be used by Rotom-H to gain momentum with Volt Switch. Unfortunately, Krookodile specifically outspeeds Rotom-H and also is immune to Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Due to Rotom-H's low Speed tier, it is vulnerable to being outsped and OHKOed before Defogging away hazards or setting up screens by faster wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo, Devastating Drake Garchomp, and Life Orb Earth Power Kyurem-B.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Choiced Trick users such as Choice Scarf Latios, Gengar, and Victini can cripple Rotom-H by taking away its Light Clay and locking it into using one move.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Toxic, Stealth Rock, and other forms of chip damage limit Rotom-H's longevity, limiting its opportunities to switch in, clear hazards from the field, and set up screens. Pokemon such as Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock, poison Rotom-H with Toxic, and chip it with sand damage. Due to the fact that Rotom-H relies on Light Clay to extend the turn of its screens, it is not able to carry Leftovers, making residual damage and switching into Stealth Rock harder to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Pokemon: Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Excadrill, with access to powerful Ground-type attacks such as Earth Power and Earthquake, ignore Levitate due to their abilities and can OHKO Rotom-H.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Reflect gives setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard X better setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Dragonite and Swampert lacking Roar and allows the team to better check threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill. Light Screen bolsters the team's special bulk, allowing the aforementioned setup sweepers to set up against special attackers such as Latios, Porygon-Z, and Hydreigon. Defog allows Rotom-H to clear entry hazards from the field and remove opposing screens, allowing the team to more easily switch around and take advantage of its own screens. Rotom-H's slow Volt Switch allows it to pivot into a teammate in order to gain momentum and take advantage of the screens Rotom-H is able to set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs maximize Rotom-H's HP stat while allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock five times. 252 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature allow Rotom-H to tank special attacks such as Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor, Choice Scarf Nihilego's Power Gem after Stealth Rock damage, and Choice Specs Seismitoad's Scald. The rest of the EVs are invested into Defense to help it take physical attacks better. Light Clay allows its screens to stay up for eight turns rather than five.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-H should switch in on predicted Ground-type attacks for its teammates, but it should be careful of Pokemon with other powerful STAB attacks that could severely weaken it such as Garchomp's Devastating Drake. It should also watch out for Pokemon whose abilities or moves ignore Levitate such as Mold Breaker Excadrill with Earthquake, Kyurem-B with Earth Power, and Landorus with Gravity. Rotom-H should try to switch in when Stealth Rock is being set up to be able to clear away entry hazards without taking the chip damage unless it is up against certain Stealth Rock setters such as Tyranitar that threaten it. As soon as all of the checks to Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Z-Celebrate Victini have been weakened, Rotom-H should set up screens and bring them in with Volt Switch so they can easily set up and proceed to clean. Due to Fire-types being weak to Stealth Rock, it is extremely important to keep Rotom-H healthy throughout the battle so that it can consistently remove hazards. Do not allow setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade to take advantage of Rotom-H's passive nature by pivoting into a check such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Instead of switching into a wallbreaker directly, use Rotom-H as a slow pivot with Volt Switch once hazards are cleared to keep your wallbreakers, setup sweepers, and cleaners such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard X healthy. Due to Rotom-H's only attacking move being Volt Switch, Taunt users such as Gliscor can easily shut it down and prevent it from clearing hazards or setting up screens. Since Rotom-H is not intrinsically slow, it should be careful of pivoting out of wallbreakers or slower threats such as Tyranitar, which can OHKO or heavily damage a majority of the team with Stone Edge. Rotom-H should hard switch out to another Pokemon rather than Volt Switching when faced with Pokemon that can set up hazards while also threatening it, such as Armaldo.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers such as Infernape and Blacephalon appreciate Rotom-H's ability to safely bring them in. Choice Band Infernape can take on Pokemon such as Chansey and can 2HKO Staraptor with Close Combat while also being able to revenge kill key threats with Mach Punch such as Choice Scarf Greninja and Excadrill in sand with minimal prior chip damage. Choice Specs Blacephalon in return can take care of annoying Pokemon for Rotom-H such as Mew, which can prevent Rotom-H from setting screens with Taunt and clear them away with Defog. Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Infernape and Blacephalon appreciate Rotom-H's ability to clear away hazards from the field, allowing them to take care of Choice Scarf Nihilego and Life Orb Latios, respectively. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona appreciate Rotom-H's ability to set screens, clear hazards, and safely pivot them in with Volt Switch, allowing them to set up and sweep with more ease. Rotom-H appreciates Mega Charizard X's ability to take care of annoying Pokemon such as Dragonite and sweep through Water-type teams at +2 with Dragon Claw and Earthquake, while Volcarona can take care of Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Seismitoad, which can not only set up Stealth Rock and remove Rotom-H's Light Clay with Knock Off but also prevent Rotom-H from safely bringing out a teammate with Volt Switch. Heatran is a nice specially defensive tank that is able to take on key threats such as Nihilego and Mega Diancie that do not have Earth Power. Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock to chip opposing Defoggers, limiting their ability to remove screens set by Rotom-H. Victini is a fantastic wallbreaker with virtually no switch-ins to sun-boosted V-create bar walls like Hippowdon and Toxapex. Victini also can cripple Pokemon holding Eviolite such as Chansey and Porygon2 with Trick. In return, Victini benefits from Rotom-H's ability to pivot it in safely with Volt Switch and its immunity to Ground-type attacks. Victini can also use Z-Celebrate, which allows it to take out some problematic Pokemon such as Heatran on Steel-type teams with +1 Focus Blast. Mega Charizard Y is also a fantastic wallbreaker and appreciates Rotom-H's ability to clear Stealth Rock, and in return, it can threaten Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Keldeo with Solar Beam. Volcanion is immune to Water-type attacks, allowing it to easily come in on threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill and OHKO it with Choice Specs-boosted Sludge Wave or Bloom Doom. Volcanion also appreciates Rotom-H's ability to remove hazards from the field, as it can switch into more Water-type attacks with hazards removed. Torkoal can also be used as a secondary hazard remover with Rotom-H and is able to set up harsh sunlight, allowing setup sweepers such as Z-Celebrate Victini and Mega Charizard X to even further take advantage of Rotom-H's screens.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Rotom-W is one of the best defensive options for Electric thanks to its decent mixed bulk, fantastic pivoting abilities with slow Volt Switches, and immunity to Ground-type moves. Its Electric / Water typing, in conjunction with Levitate, lets it wall numerous threats to Electric, such as Mamoswine and Mega Swampert. STAB Hydro Pump also gives a way for Rotom-W to threaten numerous Ground-types that bother Electric teams, such as Hippowdon and Sand Rush Excadrill. Access to Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W cripple various physical threats, such as Dragonite and Curse Alolan Muk, while its nice special bulk allows it to withstand strong hits from dangerous foes like Volcarona and Hydreigon. Rotom-W can also use Pain Split or Defog for semi-reliable recovery and additional utility to clear entry hazards and screens. Although Rotom-W's low Speed stat is useful for safely bringing a teammate on the field with Volt Switch, it also comes at the cost of being outsped by numerous threats like Tapu Bulu. Finally, Rotom-W has no reliable way to recover its HP, which means it can't recklessly pivot around and can get easily worn down.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Rotom-W's great mixed bulk and ability Levitate makes it one of the very few Ground switch-ins that Water has access to, helping to take on wallbreakers that pressure Water teams such as Choice Band Excadrill and Swords Dance Garchomp. Unlike Mantine, one of Water's other Ground-immune Pokemon, Rotom-W has Volt Switch, giving it a way to keep up momentum and have offensive utility, and it lacks a weakness to Rock that Pelipper and Mantine both have, allowing it to handle EdgeQuake coverage easily. With Volt Switch, Rotom-W can be a strong option for offensive Water teams that still want to cover strong Ground-types. Rotom-W also has other rare defensive utilities in both Defog and Will-O-Wisp, enabling it to fulfill multiple roles for the team at once. In addition to taking on Ground-types, Rotom-W's Electric typing lets it only take neutral damage from and check Electric-types such as Choice Band Thundurus. However, in spite of being a defensive Pokemon, Rotom-W has no reliable recovery options and must use Pain Split if it needs recovery, meaning it can be worn down quite quickly in its role as a defensive pivot. To make its lack of reliable recovery worse, its mixed bulk isn't enough to stop strong wallbreakers like Diggersby or Z-Move users like Garchomp. Rotom-W also faces strong competition from Mantine, a more traditional Ground-immune wall with superior special bulk as well as access to Defog and recovery in Roost. More defensive teams will normally not favor Volt Switch's pivoting potential over the longevity of Mantine.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>A physically defensive spread can be used instead to pivot into physical attackers and survive hits from stronger Pokemon like Choice Band Dragonite and Diggersby. However, such variants are left completely open to most special attackers, while a specially defensive Rotom-W can threaten physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Toxic can be used over one of the utility options to lure and cripple defensive answers, such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad, as well as setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X. Unfortunately, giving up on two moves between Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and Defog would make Rotom-W much less useful for Electric teams, as the two former moves are unique to Rotom-W while Toxic can be better used by a teammate like Zapdos.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p>Rotom-W can run a specially defensive spread in order to have a better matchup against Landorus and other Electric-types, but it will be less capable of handling most Ground-types such as Garchomp and Excadrill, making it a much more niche spread. Thunder Wave can be used over Defog as another double status set choice to make it even better against offensive Pokemon, but Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp cover most offensive Pokemon already, making it hard to usually justify using over other utility options.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-type Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur and Celebi, comfortably switch into Rotom-W's STAB moves and can hit it back super effectively. On the other hand, physical Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Breloom are threatened by Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp, so they can't reliably switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon and Seismitoad: Both of these Pokemon completely counter Rotom-W, as they are immune to its STAB moves and don't really care about being burned.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Rotom-W struggles against the numerous Dragon-types in the metagame due to their typing and natural bulk. For example, Kyurem-B and Latios easily switch into Rotom-W's moves before dealing a great amount of damage to it, while Mega Latias and Mega Charizard X can set up on it and sweep the team.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: Powerful attackers like Choice Band Diggersby and Zeraora can OHKO Rotom-W, but they must be careful as to not get burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker and Teravolt Users: Due to their respective abilities, Excadrill and Kyurem-B ignore Rotom-W's Levitate and can threaten it with a Ground-type move.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Taunt users such as Hydreigon and Mew can prevent Rotom-W from using Defog or Will-O-Wisp to clear entry hazards and screens or cripple physical attackers. Those Pokemon also take minimal damage from Rotom-W's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Rotom-W's lack of reliable recovery makes it very susceptible to Toxic and Stealth Rock. Having its Leftovers recovery canceled out by burn or sand damage can also be very detrimental for Rotom-W's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Since it lacks power and doesn't usually carry Toxic, certain walls like Zapdos and Normal's Eviolite core aren't threatened by Rotom-W at all. However, letting Rotom-W use Volt Switch too often to pivot out to a teammate could lead to fruitful results for the Electric team.</p> <h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur are normally unconcerned with most of what Rotom-W can do to them and can hit it super effectively. However, physical Grass-types, such as Breloom and Tapu Bulu, cannot switch into Rotom-W for fear of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Because it lacks reliable recovery and Pain Split is especially bad against less bulky offensive Pokemon, Rotom-W is handled by most wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo, Choice Band Diggersby, and Mega Heracross even if they are normally threatened by its moves.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon: Without Toxic, Rotom-W struggles to pressure defensive Pokemon such as Chansey at all, as it often lacks power, crippling status, and recovery, allowing them to switch in. They should be careful of frequently letting Rotom-W pivot out to a teammate, though.</p> <p><strong>Certain Electric-immune Pokemon: Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Lanturn that are unafraid of anything Rotom-W does can still switch in freely and prevent Rotom-W from pivoting out.</p> <p><strong>Poison: Poison and Toxic poison cripple Rotom-W, which already lacks longevity. As a result, Pokemon that occasionally carry ways to poison Rotom-W, such as Mantine and Celesteela, are hard for Rotom-W to pivot around before their moveset is scouted.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to gain momentum by pivoting out into a teammate safely thanks to its low Speed stat. Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's way to deal with Ground-types like Hippowdon and Sand Rush Excadrill and is its strongest STAB move. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Dragonite and Alolan Muk that Rotom-W couldn't seriously hurt otherwise. Pain Split allows Rotom-W to regain some HP, letting it tank more attacks from the opposing team, and enables Rotom-W to take advantage of defensive Pokemon such as Chansey by regaining most of its HP after each use thanks to Rotom-W's low HP stat. Defog is a nice alternative over Pain Split to clear entry hazards and screens and works well on Rotom-W thanks to its neutrality to Stealth Rock and immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The suggested EV spread and nature let Rotom-W be as specially defensive as possible while also enabling it to outspeed Jolly Azumarill and -1 Choice Band Victini. Leftovers is Rotom-W's preferred item, as it offers better longevity over the course of a long-lasting game. Wiki Berry, on the other hand, gives Rotom-W a single burst of healing, which can be pretty useful if Defog is used over Pain Split, as Rotom-W wouldn't have access to any kind of recovery otherwise. It can also recover some damage from strong moves like Hydreigon's Devastating Drake. Levitate is Rotom-W's only ability and grants it a much-needed immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W is one of the few defensive Pokemon on Electric, so it must be preserved throughout the game if threatening special attackers like Heatran are still alive. In fact, Rotom-W is best used when switched into weak moves or resisted hits before pivoting to a teammate with a slow Volt Switch to gain momentum as the opposing Pokemon switches out. Rotom-W can burn incoming physical attackers that threaten Electric teams and take little damage from its STAB moves, such as Dragonite and Tapu Bulu, making them much easier for Electric to deal with. In specific matchups, Rotom-W can be played differently. For example, against rain teams, Rotom-W walls both Seismitoad and Mega Swampert, so it can be switched into them without much to worry about. Against Ground teams with Landorus, it is essential that Rotom-W face Landorus before it can use Gravity so that it can KO it with Hydro Pump. If not, Rotom-W will be outsped and OHKOed by almost any Ground-type STAB move. Also, against Bug teams, Rotom-W must be kept healthy in order to check threats to Electric like Volcarona, since Volcarona won't 2HKO Rotom-W when unboosted or OHKO it when at +1. When facing defensive Pokemon, it is usually best for Rotom-W to Volt Switch out to a teammate that can better handle them, since most of them are too bulky to be seriously harmed by its STAB moves, and they're generally not threatened by Will-O-Wisp as much as Toxic. If Rotom-W is carrying Defog, don't pivot too much on enemy moves, as Rotom-W lacks Pain Split for recovery and Electric depends on it to clear entry hazards and screens. Finally, as a defensive Pokemon, Rotom-W must avoid Toxic and Knock Off as much as possible, as that would jeopardize its longevity and deny it passive recovery. If Wiki Berry is used over Leftovers, it is imperative for Rotom-W to not be hit by Knock Off, since that would leave it without any form of recovery whatsoever.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Every Electric team member appreciates Rotom-W's ability to slowly pivot with Volt Switch and bring them safely onto the field. Physically defensive Zapdos perfectly complements Rotom-W, as they cover almost all of each other's weaknesses. Furthermore, Rotom-W and Zapdos form a reliable defensive backbone that virtually all Electric teams rely on, thanks to their utility options, recovery, and great bulk. For example, Zapdos can reliably check Tapu Bulu for Rotom-W, and in return, Rotom-W supports Zapdos by switching into Mamoswine's STAB moves. Also, either Zapdos or Rotom-W can run Defog to free up a slot for Pain Split on Rotom-W or for Toxic on Zapdos. Tapu Koko takes on problematic Dragon-types like Kyurem-B and Kommo-o with Dazzling Gleam. Additionally, if Tapu Koko carries Grass Knot, it can take on Seismitoad and Gastrodon, both of which completely counter Rotom-W. In return, Rotom-W can switch into Ground-type moves aimed at Tapu Koko and bring it safely on the field with its slow Volt Switch. Alolan Golem and Magnezone are both useful teammates that are able to trap threatening Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn for Rotom-W, with the former also being able to set up Stealth Rock. Rotom-W can even use Volt Switch to bring either trapper against Ferrothorn to reliably KO it. Zeraora is a valued partner that handily beats Normal teams and Tapu Bulu, which give a lot of problems to Rotom-W. In return, Rotom-W acts as a great defensive pivot for Zeraora, which is often forced to switch out after locking into a move. Alolan Raichu can KO Mega Venusaur, while Rotom-W can burn Alolan Muk, which is typically paired with Mega Venusaur on Poison. Thundurus is another physical attacker that helps Rotom-W take down Mega Venusaur and Normal teams. In exchange, Rotom-W can tank Ice-type moves aimed at Thundurus, such as Ice Shard from Mamoswine, and safely bring Thundurus on the field with its slow Volt Switch.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to take advantage of its low Speed to pivot a teammate into play safely and keep up momentum. Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's most powerful STAB attack and gives it offensive presence. Importantly, Hydro Pump hits Ground-type Pokemon for super effective damage, preventing most of them from blocking Volt Switch. Defog removes entry hazards from the field and makes sure that Toxic Spikes cannot cripple Rotom-W's teammates. Will-O-Wisp is the preferred status move for Rotom-W, as it allows Rotom-W to cripple physical attackers and setup sweepers that try to boost. On teams that are especially reliant on Rotom-W's Defog, Pain Split can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp to make it a more reliable switch-in to physical attackers and capable of taking more attacks as it pivots out. Pain Split can also be used if the team doesn't need Rotom-W's Defog support. Toxic is another option that can be used with Will-O-Wisp if Defog is unneeded to cripple specific defensive checks in Seismitoad, Porygon2, and Zapdos, along with many other walls.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread and Bold nature maximize Rotom-W's physical bulk while minimizing Stealth Rock damage and ensuring it outspeeds Jolly Azumarill and defensive Landorus-T. Other EV spreads with more Speed, such as 248 HP / 40 Def / 220 Spe, can be used to allow Rotom-W to outspeed Pokemon such as Diggersby and Breloom; however, the lost Defense will make it more difficult for Rotom-W to check these Pokemon. Leftovers is useful for improving Rotom-W's longevity over a long game. Iapapa Berry can be used instead to gain a one-time burst of healing, which can come in handy against attacks like Breloom's Bullet Seed if Rotom-W needs to burn it. Levitate is Rotom-W's only ability, granting it a valuable immunity to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W should primarily be used to switch into attacks for its teammates before pivoting out again with Volt Switch. While Ground-types can block Rotom-W's Volt Switch, the threat of Hydro Pump and Will-O-Wisp can typically keep most of them from switching in or staying in against it. However, because Gastrodon and Seismitoad are immune to Hydro Pump, they are big threats to Rotom-W and it should typically double switch out when you expect them to come in. Rotom-W still needs to be careful around other Electric-immune Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, as they can freely switch into Volt Switch and threaten to use a Volt Switch of their own. However, be careful with letting Rotom-W take more powerful hits when it switches in, as its lack of reliable recovery prevents it from being a switch-in to wallbreakers. Whenever the opponent has set entry hazards, try to bring Rotom-W into play to remove them. If possible, try to switch it in as Stealth Rock is being set, as Rotom-W hates taking even minor residual damage. For the same reason, be sure to avoid letting Rotom-W get poisoned or badly poisoned, as it will be much easier to wear down. Because Leftovers helps counteract the chip damage it inevitably will take, avoid Knock Off users. Alolan Muk is a particularly dangerous Knock Off user, as its Poison Touch ability can allow it to poison Rotom-W and simultaneously remove Leftovers. If it's running Toxic itself, Rotom-W should typically hide it to surprise walls that do not expect to get crippled. It can also be used to put setup sweepers on a timer if Will-O-Wisp is incapable of stopping them. Otherwise, Rotom-W should usually avoid contesting other defensive Pokemon, as it cannot afford to take a status move and has no reliable recovery. That being said, Pain Split should be used mainly against other defensive Pokemon, as Rotom-W's low base HP makes it especially good at healing against them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thanks to Levitate, Rotom-W makes a fantastic teammate for Water teams that are typically threatened by the strong Ground-type attackers in Excadrill and Landorus-T but prefer to have the offensive presence that other defensive Ground checks lack. Choice Scarf Greninja with U-turn can form a strong VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and also runs Gunk Shot, making it a good check to Grass-types. In addition to this, Greninja can revenge kill many of the powerful attackers that Rotom-W cannot check defensively, such as Choice Band Dragonite and Diggersby. Wallbreakers such as Mega Sharpedo and Choice Specs Keldeo are good options to receive Volt Switch's free switch, as they can break many of the walls that try to stop Rotom-W. Setup sweepers such as Gyarados and Mega Slowbro are also very capable of taking advantage of the momentum that Volt Switch provides, as Rotom-W can bring them onto the field against Pokemon they can set up on. Gyarados is especially notable for being able to beat Mega Venusaur and other Grass-types that Rotom-W cannot deal with. Good switch-ins to Grass-types are often needed because Rotom-W will often pivot out of them; Toxapex, Empoleon, and Sap Sipper Azumarill are especially great teammates for this purpose. Toxapex and Empoleon are notable for setting Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively, which can help cripple and chip at Pokemon as they are forced out by Rotom-W. In addition to its unique Grass immunity, Sap Sipper Azumarill can Perish trap the walls that Rotom-W can't handle, such as Chansey. On more defensive teams, Alomomola's use of huge Wishes and Regenerator makes it another good defensive pivot option that helps keep Rotom-W very healthy.</p> "

Its dual typing lets it switch into Steel-type attacks from Choice Scarf Excadrill and Jirachi and burn them. Access to Volt Switch allows Rotom-F to keep momentum and switch to an offensive teammate like Kyurem-B, Alolan Sandslash, or Mamoswine. Additionally, it fills the role of an entry hazard remover for Ice teams with Defog, which is especially important to a type generally weak to Stealth Rock. It also takes pressure off other hazard-removing teammates like Alolan Sandslash and Avalugg. However, its HP isn't high enough to keep it safe from wallbreakers like Diggersby and Victini. Its best form of recovery is Pain Split, which is largely dependent on the opponent's HP, making it an inconsistent means of recovering health. Rotom-F's Stealth Rock weakness and mediocre recovery also result in it being worn down very quickly when it switches in, hindering its effectiveness as an entry hazard remover.

Predict when special walls like Chansey and Zapdos will try to switch into Rotom-F and use Volt Switch to gain the necessary momentum for an offensive teammate. Similarly, try to predict when an offensive Pokemon like Latios or Victini tries to switch in so that you can bring in Weavile to trap them with Pursuit.

Piloswine can switch into Rock-type attacks from Nihilego and Mega Diancie for Rotom-F thanks to its secondary Ground typing.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is a strong Electric-type STAB move that is necessary for Rotom-C to effectively check Mega Pinsir and Celesteela. Volt Switch allows Rotom-C to generate momentum off of forced switches and bring teammates in safely. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's most powerful attack and lets it check threats such as Mega Diancie. Hidden Power Ice is useful coverage for hitting Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios as well as pesky Electric-immune foes in the Flying matchup such as Gliscor. Trick is an option over Hidden Power Ice as a means of crippling defensive switch-ins to Rotom-C such as Chansey and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment ensures Rotom-C hits as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf allows Rotom-C to outspeed key threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam. Levitate is Rotom-C's only ability; it helps Rotom-C check Mega Pinsir in the Bug matchup, lets it avoid Sticky Web, and lets it switch into Ground-type attackers that threaten the team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-C should primarily be used as a revenge killer to check offensive threats to the team and generate momentum off them using Volt Switch. Use Volt Switch liberally on predicted switches to pivot safely out to teammates that can take advantage of and to deal chip damage against threats such as Mega Charizard Y that Rotom-C cannot OHKO. Rotom-C benefits greatly from entry hazards set by teammates to deal chip damage against Pokemon it forces out such as Excadrill and Skarmory. Rotom-C should be switched into Ground-type attacks that threaten teammates on Grass, such as Excadrill's Earthquake, so that it can force them out with Leaf Storm. However, take care to preserve Rotom-C in matchups where it'll be needed to check threats to the team, such as Mega Charizard Y when against Flying. If using Trick, use it to cripple dangerous walls to the team such as Zapdos. However, be careful not to give away Rotom-C's Choice Scarf while there are still threats on the field that it is needed to check, such as Choice Scarf Togekiss.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Every Pokemon on Grass appreciates Rotom-C's ability to bring them in safely on switches using Volt Switch and check threats to the team such as Mega Pinsir. Mega Venusaur is a defensive staple of Grass teams and an excellent teammate for Rotom-C; it easily manages many of the offensive threats Rotom-C cannot check such as Mega Scizor and Mold Breaker Excadrill. In return, Rotom-C can take the pressure off Mega Venusaur to check Sand Rush Excadrill, which takes tremendous damage from Leaf Storm and cannot hit Rotom-C effectively. Cradily and Ferrothorn form an effective hazard stacking core using Stealth Rock and Spikes that helps Rotom-C rack up damage by forcing switches as a revenge killer. Cradily can check Fire-types such as Volcarona for the team, while Ferrothorn manages threats such as Kyurem-B and Latios that Rotom-C struggles to check. Tapu Bulu serves as a dangerous physical attacker and partner to Rotom-C, using Grassy Terrain-boosted STAB attacks and Fighting- and Rock-type coverage to break the many walls Rotom-C lures in and pivots on, such as Zapdos and Chansey. Rotom-C serving as the team's revenge killer also allows Tapu Bulu to utilize wallbreaking sets such as Choice Band and Swords Dance + Z-Move. Celebi is a complementary special attacker that supports Rotom-C in the Poison and Steel matchups with its Psychic-type STAB attacks and useful coverage. Breloom is a strong physical attacker with excellent utility in Spore and strong Technician-boosted priority that assists Rotom-C in the Steel and Normal matchups, where Rotom-C finds itself easily walled by Ferrothorn and Chansey.</p> "

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy is one of the most fearsome wallbreakers available to Water teams thanks to Tail Glow, which allows it to boost its Special Attack by three stages in a turn, letting it break through most defensive cores with ease. Furthermore, Manaphy can boost its Speed stat through Z-Rain Dance, letting it take on faster Pokemon much more easily and become an effective late-game cleaner. Excellent natural bulk makes it easy for Manaphy to set up the aforementioned moves as well. Manaphy's exceptional wallbreaking capability makes it very easy to fit on Water teams, performing its job well in almost every team archetype. Moreover, Manaphy has access to great coverage moves such as Psychic, Ice Beam, and Energy Ball along with a strong STAB move in Surf. At the same time, however, it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, finding it impossible to fit in all of its coverage moves along with Tail Glow, Rain Dance, and an obligatory Water-type move. Without a Tail Glow up, Manaphy's average Special Attack prevents it from dealing much damage and forces it to set up before it performs a sweep. Manaphy's Speed tier isn't amazing either, getting outsped by common Choice Scarf users and revenge killers before it sets up a Z-Rain Dance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scald can be used instead of Surf in an attempt to get a burn on the foe. However, Surf's superior damage output and stronger Hydro Vortex make it the better choice, as this set heavily relies on dishing out enough damage to KO the foe before it deals enough damage to prevent Manaphy from sweeping safely. A Tail Glow set without Waterium Z and Rain Dance can also be used, freeing up the item slot for slight recovery in the form of Leftovers and a moveslot for another coverage move such as Ice Beam. This allows other Pokemon such as Gyarados to run Z-Moves, but Manaphy loses out on the Speed boost, letting it get outsped by countless revenge killers and wallbreakers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-type Pokemon can easily KO Manaphy with their STAB moves. Although Ice Beam does threaten most of them, Grass teams have an extremely reliable switch in in Ferrothorn that can beat Manaphy while also regaining its health back.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Fast Electric-type Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu can very easily KO Manaphy with their STAB moves. If Electric Terrain is present, Alolan Raichu manages to outspeed Manaphy even at +1 Speed.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users: Phazers and Haze users can negate Manaphy's boosts and prevent it from getting a Speed boost, as Z-Rain Dance can only be used once. Some notable phazers and Haze users are Empoleon and Mantine.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-type Pokemon like Slowbro can take any of Manaphy's moves besides Energy Ball easily.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios can take any move Manaphy chooses to go for besides Ice Beam very well and hit back with their STAB moves. Kyurem-B can even take Ice Beam decently well and KO Manaphy with Fusion Bolt.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster revenge killers, such as Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain and Choice Scarf Terrakion, can revenge kill a +1 Manaphy after a bit of prior damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Tail Glow lets Manaphy increase its Special Attack and become a fearsome wallbreaker able to break through walls that Water teams may have trouble against. Rain Dance summons rain and boosts the power of Water-type moves while also activating Hydration. However, its main purpose in this set lies in Z-Rain Dance, boosting Manaphy's Speed and letting it outspeed revenge killers it otherwise gets outsped by, such as Mega Alakazam. Surf is Manaphy's most reliable Water-type STAB move with a decent damage output. Psychic is Manaphy's most important coverage option, allowing it to hit Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, which otherwise completely wall Manaphy. Hitting Mega Venusaur is particularly important, as it poses a huge threat to Water teams. Ice Beam can alternatively be used, being able to hit Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage, which take little damage from Surf. This leaves Manaphy unable to break through Toxapex, however. Energy Ball can be run as a coverage move to beat bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and opposing Manaphy. As is the case with Ice Beam sets, though, Energy Ball Manaphy finds itself powerless against a Toxapex, which can proceed to remove the stat boosts with Haze, while also being unable to break through Dragon-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The set revolves around Waterium Z, letting Manaphy get a raise in Speed when it uses Z-Rain Dance. Waterium Z can also be used to fire off a Hydro Vortex instead if the Speed boost is unneeded. Hydration is Manaphy's only ability and works well in tandem with Rain Dance, letting it set up on status users like Chansey and Mega Sableye easily. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are self-explanatory; on an offensive set like this, maximizing Manaphy's offensive stats is crucial. A Timid nature lets it Speed tie with the crowded base 100 Speed tier, as well as with Choice Scarf Victini after a Z-Rain Dance. Finally, 4 EVs in Special Defense raise Download users like Porygon-Z's Attack instead of Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to set up on Pokemon that use status as their main way of wearing down the foe such as Sableye, as Hydration heals whatever status Manaphy is inflicted by in rain. Manaphy doesn't always need to go for Z-Rain Dance; it can fire off a Hydro Vortex instead to deal massive amounts of damage and can be used to wallbreak early-game to make it easier for cleaners like Greninja to clean up. This is generally useful against bulkier teams, where the Speed boost is unnecessary. Rain Dance can also be used to boost the power of Hydro Vortex when Manaphy doesn't the need the Speed boost. In rain, even Mega Venusaur gets OHKOed by a Hydro Vortex after a Tail Glow boost. Thanks to its access to means of raising both its Special Attack and Speed, Manaphy can be used as a wallbreaker or a late-game sweeper depending on the matchup. Manaphy usually needs as much health as possible to guarantee it gets off a Tail Glow or Z-Rain Dance and hates getting worn down. It is thus unwise to directly switch Manaphy in on offensive threats, and it shouldn't be brought in on entry hazards either. Generally, Tail Glow should be used before Z-Rain Dance to allow Manaphy to take on phazers that may switch in. Due to the fact that Z-Crystals cannot get Knocked Off, setting up on Pokemon that use Knock Off as their main STAB or coverage move for Water-types such as Bisharp is a good idea. In certain cases, Manaphy can even switch in on Knock Off, but it is generally unwise to do so to avoid taking unnecessary damage. Z-Rain Dance can only be used once per game, so don't use it unnecessarily if there's still a Pokemon present that can force Manaphy out in the opposing team. Similarly, watch out for Pokemon that can phaze Manaphy or can use Haze.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Manaphy's wallbreaking potential makes it a great Pokemon to use on any team archetype. It can be used on rain teams effectively, being able to both set up Rain Dance and take advantage of it through Hydration, while balance teams appreciate Manaphy's wallbreaking and sweeping capabilities. Physical wallbreakers like Mega Sharpedo and Azumarill form excellent offensive cores with Manaphy by being able to take out each other's checks easily. Pokemon that can deal with Dragon-types, such as Azumarill and Tapu Fini, make an excellent core. Tapu Fini can also completely shut down stall in tandem with Manaphy. Swift Swim users such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Seismitoad love Manaphy's ability to set up rain and the latter two especially appreciate the removal of special walls like Chansey, making it easier for them to clean up. Stealth Rock support can make wallbreaking and sweeping much easier for Manaphy, being able to break Focus Sashes and Sturdy while also providing chip damage. Notable Stealth Rock users are Empoleon and Swampert. Entry hazard removal is also greatly appreciated by Manaphy because it needs as much HP as possible to set up. Empoleon and Mantine are two of the best Defog users available to Water teams. Being a Water-type, Manaphy suffers from weaknesses to Electric- and Grass-type moves. Pokemon with a neutrality to Grass-type moves such as Mantine, Empoleon, and Toxapex or an immunity to Electric-type moves such as Swampert and Lanturn are important for Manaphy. Thanks to Hydration and Rain Dance, Manaphy is a great status absorber and can switch in on most status users with ease. This greatly helps physical attackers like Mega Sharpedo and Gyarados, as they fear Will-O-Wisp, and defensive Pokemon like Mega Slowbro that hate Toxic.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Victini plays a big role on Psychic teams as a check to Bug- and Steel-types thanks to its Fire typing. It's especially useful in checking Volcarona, which is a huge threat to Psychic teams, as it can Speed tie with it, take a +1 Bug Buzz, and always OHKO it with V-create. Its base 100 stats across the board give it decent bulk, offensive capabilities, and speed. Victini has access to an insanely powerful STAB move in V-create, which allows it to function as a great wallbreaker, especially with Choice Band. Victini is also a great Choice Scarf user thanks to its good Speed and pivoting capabilities with U-turn. It has a great movepool that includes coverage options like Bolt Strike and a great tool in Blue Flare, which helps it sweep Bug teams. Unfortunately, its Fire typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock, which heavily limits its pivoting capabilities, as well as to common offensive types in Water, Ground, and Rock. Although it sits at a solid Speed tier, Victini can be outsped and revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Diancie, especially after a Speed drop from V-create.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Thanks to Fire's ability to provide sun support, Choice Band Victini is capable of at least 2HKOing almost every Pokemon that is not immune to Fire-type attacks with its powerful V-create, making it the strongest wallbreaker in Monotype. Notably, Victini's V-create is capable of breaking every defensive core that typically gives Fire trouble, including Normal's, Poison's, and Water's, meaning it hardly needs to predict in spite of using a Choice item. Victini can also use extra supportive options in Bolt Strike to KO almost all Water-types and Fire-immune Pokemon and U-turn to avoid Pursuit trappers and pivot into teammates. It has decent defensive stats for an offensive Pokemon, allowing it to take some weaker hits relatively easily, particularly Scald from Water-type walls in sun. Unfortunately, V-create's Defense and Special Defense drops make Victini very easy to revenge kill, a problem only compounded by the accompanying loss in Speed allowing even slower Pursuit trappers like Scizor to trap and KO Victini. To make the Speed loss even more of an issue, its natural Speed is already rather average, making it only really able to beat defensive Pokemon and a handful of the slowest offensive Pokemon like Mamoswine. Victini does still have trouble fitting onto some Fire teams, as it doesn't help with the more important offensive threats to the type in Nihilego and Mega Diancie, and other Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Infernape can wallbreak while compressing other roles such as setup sweeper and priority revenge killer.</p> ",

Most Water-types, however, cannot switch into Bolt Strike well.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-type Pokemon such as Greninja and Hydreigon can easily take out Victini with their STAB moves. Additionally, Pursuit trappers like Weavile and Alolan Muk can take advantage of Victini's Defense drop after using V-create to KO it. However, they don't appreciate taking a hit from Victini.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types like Gastrodon and Hippowdon can easily take a hit from Victini and KO it back with their STAB moves. Hippowdon cannot switch into Choice Band Victini, however. Sand Rush Excadrill can take out Choice Scarf Victini in sand, while Landorus can take out Choice Band Victini. Dugtrio can prevent Victini from switching out and takes any hit thanks to Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Victini is prone to being revenge killed after dropping its defenses and Speed with V-create. Priority users like Azumarill and Bisharp can take it out with Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch, respectively. Faster Pokemon like Terrakion, Mega Diancie, and Greninja can also take it out easily.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Mega Slowbro: Mega Slowbro is always capable of switching into any of Victini's moves when Stealth Rock isn't up because it is immune to Trick and can survive two hits from V-create and Bolt Strike. Mega Slowbro can then freely use Victini as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Because Victini's Defense and Speed drop after using V-create, it is very easy to Pursuit trap. For example, even Adamant Choice Band Scizor can outspeed a -1 Victini, and Pursuit almost always OHKOes even if Victini stays in, making it a surefire check for Bug teams.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Victini's average Speed even before V-create makes it very susceptible to many Pokemon that can revenge kill it, such as Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Gallade. Like with Pursuit users, the Defense and Special Defense drops incurred by V-create make it even easier to OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: If sun is not active, Victini can be walled. Sand teams can wall it with physically defensive Gastrodon, which can spam Toxic or Scald after switching in.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create is Victini's strongest STAB move and is easily spammable due to its incredibly high Base Power. It's useful for hitting Bug-, Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Volcarona, Celesteela, Serperior, and Alolan Sandslash. Bolt Strike targets Water-types that attempt to switch in on a Fire-type move such as Gyarados and Azumarill. U-turn lets Victini pivot around and gain momentum when predicting the foe to switch out. Blue Flare is Victini's secondary Fire-type STAB move and is useful for late-game cleaning against Steel- and Bug-type teams, since it doesn't cause stat drops like V-create.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Hasty nature and Choice Scarf is used to outspeed or Speed tie with threats like +1 Mega Gyarados, +1 Porygon-Z, and +1 Volcarona. Maximum investment is made in Attack in order to maximize Victini's damage output. A Hasty nature is preferred over Naive to allow Victini to deal with Volcarona better. Victory Star increases the accuracy of V-create, Bolt Strike, and Blue Flare.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep Stealth Rock off the field, as it limits Victini's pivoting capabilities. Choice Scarf Victini is a great revenge killer because it outspeeds most unboosted Pokemon and can hit them with its powerful V-create. However, the drop in its Speed and defenses after using V-create makes it easy to revenge kill or set up on, which forces it to switch out. Be wary of using V-create when there are Pursuit trappers, as they can take advantage of the -1 Defense to deal huge damage to Victini. Switching Victini in on entry hazards should be avoided to preserve its health and longevity. Keep Victini healthy, especially in the Bug and Steel matchups where it needs to check threats like Volcarona and Mega Scizor. Locking Victini into a coverage move can sometimes turn it into setup bait. For example, while it may seem that Blue Flare can be spammed against Bug teams, Volcarona can use Victini to set up if it locks itself into Blue Flare. Therefore, use Blue Flare to clean up Bug teams after Volcarona is gone. Victini can often be used as a lead and can scout the opponent's play with U-turn. U-turn should also be used to pivot out of checks like Porygon2 and Gastrodon. Although Victini's bulk is decent, it should avoid switching in on powerful attacks such as Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt and Scolipede's Megahorn. Keep Victini away from poison and paralysis; poison harms its longevity and limits its ability to pivot around, and paralysis halves its Speed, rendering it almost useless.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Victini is a staple pick on Psychic teams due to its ability to check Bug- and Steel-types as well as revenge kill. Jirachi is a great partner to Victini, as it can pivot into strong special attacks as well as check Rock-types like Nihilego. Jirachi can also set Stealth Rock, bring Victini in safely through a slow U-turn, and give Victini another chance to clean up with Wish. Mew can set Stealth Rock while being able to stallbreak and remove common checks to Victini such as Porygon2 and Quagsire. Double Dance Mew appreciates having Victini bring it in safely via U-turn and give it more opportunities to set up. In return, Mew can wallbreak with +2 Genesis Supernova and set Psychic Terrain, which protects Victini from priority moves like Sucker Punch. Celebi can switch into Water- and Ground-types easily. It can also absorb status thanks to its great ability in Natural Cure and set Stealth Rock. Slowbro can switch into and check many physical attackers that threaten Victini such as Terrakion and Rhyperior. With a Colbur Berry, it can additionally check Dark-types like Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados with Thunder Wave and Grass Knot. Mega Slowbro and Victini can take out Steel teams more easily together. Mega Slowbro appreciates having Victini wear down the opposing team with V-create, as that allows it to set up and clean up more easily. Conversely, Mega Slowbro is a great switch-in to Knock Off for Victini.</p> <p>Deoxys-S can stack entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team, making it easier for Victini to clean up. Latios and Mega Latias can get rid of Stealth Rock with Defog. They also provide a much-appreciated Ground immunity and switch-in to Water-types like Rotom-W. Mega Gardevoir and Mega Gallade are excellent wallbreakers that can weaken Victini's checks in addition to checking Dark-types. Furthermore, they can break through Poison's defensive core of Toxapex, Alolan Muk, and Mega Venusaur, allowing Victini to clean up with ease. Mega Alakazam is a good special attacker that can beat many of Victini's checks, such as Heatran and Kingdra, thanks to its Trace ability. Meloetta is a great check to Ghost-types like Alolan Marowak and Choice Scarf Gengar thanks to its Normal typing. It can also wallbreak and let Victini clean up more easily.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create is Victini's strongest and most spammable attack because it deals a massive amount of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, often 2HKOing them. Walls that do resist it like Mantine and Torkoal still take a huge amount of damage. It's especially useful for hitting Bug- and Steel-types that Psychic teams have trouble dealing with. Bolt Strike takes care of Water-types that try to switch in on V-create such as Toxapex and Mega Slowbro. U-turn lets Victini pivot around or get momentum when predicting the foe to switch out. Trick allows Victini to cripple passive Pokemon that can be annoying to take out such as Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack with a Choice Band allows Victini to hit as hard as possible, enabling it to KO walls like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Toxapex with the appropriate move. Maximum investment in Speed is used along with a Jolly nature to let Victini Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Volcarona and Manaphy, outspeed Pokemon like Landorus-T and Kyurem-B, and outspeed Rotom-W even at -1. Victory Star increases the accuracy of Victini's V-create and Bolt Strike.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Victini can be sent out at any point of the game to wallbreak and weaken foes for teammates like Latios and Mega Alakazam to clean up. Victini can bluff a Choice Scarf set in order to lure in and KO walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Choice Band should be revealed when trying to surprise the opponent with a strong Choice Band-boosted V-create. Gaining momentum with U-turn is much more effective once the opponent knows Victini's using Choice Band. V-create can be spammed with freedom because it can break almost all of Victini's defensive checks. However, Victini will be forced to switch out the turn after due to the stat drops. Trick should be used against Steel teams to allow Victini to switch between Bolt Strike and V-create, effectively breaking the team. Keep in mind that Victini may receive a useless item like Rocky Helmet after using Trick, however. Barring the Steel matchup, though, losing Choice Band is almost never worth the move freedom. Victini should be kept away from entry hazards to remain as healthy as possible throughout the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since this Victini set needs to switch out more often, pivots such as Jirachi, Celebi, and Slowbro are great partners. Jirachi and Celebi can set Stealth Rock, giving Victini an easier time wallbreaking. Additionally, Jirachi can bring it in safely through a U-turn, restore its health with Wish, and cripple faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave, and Celebi can absorb status and switch into Ground- and Water-types for Victini. Thanks to its amazing bulk, Slowbro can check most physical attackers. It can also cripple faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Deoxys-S can stack entry hazards like Spikes and Stealth Rock, which increases Victini's offensive presence tremendously, as well as set up dual screens, which help keep Victini safe and are useful against offensive teams. Due to the lack of Choice Scarf on this set, alternate Choice Scarf users like Meloetta and Latios can be used. Meloetta can check Ghost-types like Gengar thanks to its Normal typing. Latios can remove entry hazards with Defog and wallbreak alongside Victini. Additionally, Choice Scarf Latios outspeeds common Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Hydreigon and puts tremendous pressure on Dragon teams. Mega Latias can also remove entry hazards with Defog, provide a Ground immunity, and switch into Water-types like Keldeo. Calm Mind Mega Latias capitalizes on Victini's ability to take out its checks. Cleaners like Double Dance Mew and Mega Alakazam appreciate Victini's wallbreaking abilities. Mega Gardevoir can check Dark-types thanks to its Fairy typing and weather sweepers like Excadrill and Kingdra thanks to its pre-Mega ability in Trace.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>V-create makes Victini an unstoppable wallbreaker under sun, able to hit almost anything for at least a 2HKO at the cost of almost forcing it to switch out after every attack. When sun isn't up to boost V-create's damage output, Bolt Strike pressures Water teams by being able to 2HKO even Toxapex and Mega Slowbro with Stealth Rock support, as only Electric-immune Water-types can switch into it and it doesn't drop Victini's Speed. U-turn allows Victini to switch out to a teammate on a forced switch, which lets it gain momentum in matchups where it is afraid to KO foes because of Pursuit trappers like Scizor. Because sun-boosted V-create and Bolt Strike cover almost the entire metagame, Trick is rarely used, but it is a decent filler option in specific circumstances such as for crippling Gastrodon on sand teams or if sun is no longer an option.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band and maximum Attack investment make Victini's V-create as strong as possible, and Victory Star makes sure it can never miss. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs are used to make sure Victini can outspeed Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Mega Garchomp, and Kyurem-B that would otherwise be able to KO it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Victini should be sent in as often as possible when sun is up, as it is all but guaranteed a KO with V-create if it is in against a slower Pokemon. If sun is up and there are no Fire-immune Pokemon on the opposing team, V-create is almost always spammable, as even Pokemon that resist it can be easily KOed. However, be careful of Pursuit users, as Victini is a sitting duck after using V-create and will almost certainly be taken out by them. For example, be careful of spamming V-create too much against Poison teams, as Alolan Muk can outspeed a -3 Victini and be guaranteed to Pursuit trap it. Don't be afraid to take Toxic from walls to KO them, as Victini rarely stays in long enough for the scaling poison damage to matter. You should be aware of V-create's 8 PP, as it can disappear rather quickly, and Victini is an unimpressive wallbreaker without V-create. This is especially problematic against Pressure Pokemon or Protect users that can stall additional PP out. Victini is also very dependent on Choice Band to make its V-create strong enough to wallbreak, so it should avoid letting even weaker Knock Off users like Tornadus-T remove its item. Victini will need to switch in and out frequently due to V-create's drops, so be diligent in removing Stealth Rock to make sure Victini is as healthy as possible. Bolt Strike should mainly be used only against Fire-immune Pokemon or against Water teams when Victini can possibly be setup fodder after using V-create, as Pokemon like Suicune and Keldeo can only set up on V-create. In other circumstances, even against Pokemon that resist V-create, Bolt Strike is usually not worth needing to predict around. Trick should almost never be used, but if your sun setter is KOed, Victini can use it to cripple its switch-ins.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Torkoal is a necessary teammate for Victini, as it provides sun support, Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and a defensive pivot, all of which are essential to making Victini's job possible. Outside of Torkoal, Victini doesn't need much team support and helps its teammates more instead. However, Rotom-H can be a substitute for Torkoal on more offensive teams, as its dual screens support can protect Victini from Pursuit trappers, and it can use Defog to remove Stealth Rock as well while giving Victini free switches with Volt Switch. However, lacking sun support does noticeably lower Victini's damage output against faster Pokemon that can now switch into one V-create and threaten to revenge kill. If Torkoal is replaced for Rotom-H, Mega Charizard Y is a decent replacement that can still set sun for Victini. A Choice Scarf user in either Blacephalon or Infernape can be useful to take out faster Pokemon like Gengar, Mega Diancie, and Nihilego for Victini. Heatran can also beat Mega Diancie and Nihilego with its Steel typing while providing Stealth Rock if necessary. Setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Volcarona appreciate Victini's ability to break almost all defensive Pokemon that can stop them, making them even more threatening. Volcanion can be helpful for switching into Water-types when Victini is forced out after using V-create. Notably, it is immune to Azumarill's Aqua Jet, making it useful for checking Z-Belly Drum Azumarill if Victini locks into V-create outside of sun.</p> "

  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<h1>Grass</h1> <p>Serperior's great Special Attack stat, Speed stat, and ability in Contrary allow it to be a powerful sweeper. Contrary boosts its Special Attack each time a Leaf Storm is used, allowing it to break past Pokemon like Toxapex, Mantine, and Porygon2, and its great Speed stat allows it to outpace most of the metagame including Pokemon like Mega Gallade, Landorus, and Mega Diancie. It also has great utility options with Glare, Substitute, and Leech Seed that allow it to wear down the opposing team. However, Serperior's mediocre bulk means that it is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Weavile, Choice Scarf users like Latios and Heracross, and priority users like Dragonite and Diggersby. Serperior also suffers from a lack of good coverage options, as it relies on Hidden Power Fire to hit Steel-types super effectively. It also has to rely on Leaf Storm to do major damage because of its mediocre Special Attack stat. Furthermore, it is hard to justify a spot on the team for Serperior when other Pokemon such as Celebi, Whimsicott, and Decidueye individually improve matchups significantly, such as Steel and Poison, Dragon and Dark, and Psychic, respectively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p>Glare can be used over Leech Seed to paralyze troublesome Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Kyurem-B; however, Serperior will struggle to keep itself healthy without Leech Seed because it will rely more on its passive recovery from Leftovers. Dragon Pulse can be used over Hidden Power Fire to threaten Dragon-types like Kyurem-B and Dragonite; however, without it Serperior cannot hit important Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn in the Steel-type matchup. Choice Scarf can be used to make Serperior outpace Pokemon like Weavile and Choice Scarf Latios; however, its mediocre Special Attack stat, lack of coverage options, and inability to switch its moves make it hard to justify using over better Choice Scarf users like Tapu Bulu.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p><strong>Status: Pokemon that usually run Toxic such as Chansey and Celesteela can hinder Serperior, as it can no longer keep itself healthy while using Leaf Storm. Serperior should not come out if Toxic Spikes from Toxapex are on the field, as this will hinder its passive recovery from Leftovers. Thunder Wave from Jirachi or Porygon2 can make Serperior unable to outpace Pokemon it needs to like Heatran in order to outstall its Magma Storm PP with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Serperior fails to take Fire-type attacks from Heatran, Mega Charizard X and Y, and Volcarona, as while it does outpace these Pokemon, it fails to do any significant damage to them before getting OHKOed.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Pesky Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Mega Venusaur can cause Serperior trouble, as these Pokemon can tank any of its attacks and OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users: Haze users like Toxapex and Mantine can either get rid of Serperior's boost or make it waste Leaf Storm's PP; however, after two Leaf Storm boosts, they have trouble removing them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers and Priority: Faster Pokemon like Weavile and Choice Scarf Pokemon like Latios, Kyurem-B, and Infernape can outpace Serperior and easily take care of it with their STAB attacks.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Serperior's Leech Seed helps to keep itself healthy against Pokemon like Celesteela, Toxapex, and Chansey. Serperior using Substitute is key to force switches on Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn and ease predictions to make it harder for the opposing team to revenge kill Serperior. The combination of Leech Seed and Substitute also helps Serperior wear down Pokemon like Heatran and Chansey. Leaf Storm boosts Serperior's Special Attack to break past bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Sableye and clean weakened teams late-game. Hidden Power Fire, when powered up once, allows Serperior to take care of Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Forretress, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Serperior to outpace Pokemon like Mega Gallade and Keldeo. Leftovers allows Serperior to have passive recovery while using Substitute + Leech Seed to get some HP back. Contrary allows Serperior to boost its Special Attack by using Leaf Storm and to take advantage of Sticky Web to get a Speed boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Let Serperior come in on bulkier Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, on weak attacks like Forretress's Gyro Ball, on a predicted switch, or on predicted entry hazards from opposing Landorus-T or Garchomp. Make sure to scout common defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela to make sure they aren't running Toxic as well as common Thunder Wave users such as Jirachi, as status will cripple Serperior significantly. Due to Serperior's mediocre bulk, do not let it take strong attacks such as Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Celesteela's Heavy Slam. Switch Serperior out when Pokemon that commonly have priority such as Dragonite, Diggersby, Weavile, and Bisharp are on the field, as Serperior does not take these attacks well. Prioritize using Leech Seed against bulkier teams such as Normal, Poison, and Flying, as it will slowly wear them down especially if there are entry hazards up. Use Serperior to clean late-game, as once all its checks and counters are out of the way, it has an easier time sweeping. In the Steel-type matchup, try to wear down Heatran as much as possible, as after Serperior powers up from using Leaf Storm, it can sweep with Hidden Power Fire. It can also outstall Heatran's Magma Storm PP by using Substitute, to fish for a miss and, when given the opportunity, use Leech Seed to help wear it down. Be careful around Pokemon with the ability Pressure like Zapdos and Suicune, as they can get rid of Leaf Storm's PP and make Serperior unable to clean late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is a must-have partner for Serperior because of its ability in Thick Fat and physical bulk, as this enables it to take on Pokemon such as Infernape and Mamoswine. Mega Venusaur can also soak up Toxic Spikes, which Serperior appreciates. Ferrothorn helps wear down bulkier teams like Normal and Dark with Spikes and can cripple Ice and Flying teams with Stealth Rock and Leech Seed and by forcing switches. Ferrothorn's Steel typing is also great for taking Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks like Greninja's Ice Beam, Latios's Draco Meteor, and Mimikyu's Play Rough and forcing their users out, which helps Serperior sweep late-game. Breloom greatly helps in the Ice-, Normal-, and Dark-type matchups with its Fighting typing against Pokemon like Weavile, Chansey, and Greninja. With Spore, Breloom can put passive Pokemon like Toxapex and common Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp to sleep. When running Rockium Z with Stone Edge, Breloom can take care of Celesteela and Mandibuzz after a Swords Dance. Celebi can help with the Steel-type matchup, as it can run Groundium Z to OHKO Heatran and threaten both Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. With its Psychic-type STAB move, Celebi can also improve the Poison-type matchup, and it can even force in Alolan Muk and OHKO it after one Nasty Plot when running Groundium Z. Tapu Bulu is the best Choice Scarf user for Grass, as it can OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona with Stone Edge as well as help with fast Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Lopunny. Thanks to Grassy Terrain, it also provides Serperior with more passive recovery and makes Leaf Storm more powerful, which it appreciates. Cradily is able to set up Stealth Rock to complete a stacking duo with Ferrothorn. It is also a great specially defensive wall that can take on Hydreigon, Latios, and Fire-types like Volcarona and Blacephalon. Whimsicott can help with matchups like Dragon, Dark, and Fighting because of its Fairy typing, threatening Pokemon like Garchomp, Mega Sableye, and Mega Gallade. Thanks to Whimsicott's Fairy typing, it stops Kommo-o from using its Clangorous Soulblaze that would otherwise be a big threat to the team. Whimsicott can also help with its utility moves in Tailwind, Encore, and Stun Spore to help Serperior outpace faster Pokemon like Latios and setup Pokemon like Volcarona, and slow down threatening Pokemon like Greninja and Victini. Decidueye helps with the Psychic-type matchup because of its combination of Swords Dance, Spirit Shackle, and Shadow Sneak being able to take care of most of these Pokemon. With Spirit Shackle, Swords Dance, and Roost, it can trap troublesome walls like Toxapex, Mantine, and Celesteela and take care of them. Decidueye also greatly helps with Victini, a big threat to Grass teams, as once a Pokemon gets OHKOed by V-create, it can come in and take care of it or use it as a chance to set up with Swords Dance.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Excadrill is the premier Sand Rush sweeper on Ground teams and possesses equally valued revenge killing potential thanks to its amazing Attack stat. Sand Rush doubles its semi-decent Speed in sand, allowing it to make full use of its wallbreaking potential and making it nearly impossible to revenge kill. Excadrill can also choose to run Choice Scarf sets on teams not utilizing sand, taking on the role of a fast revenge killer. Its other viable ability, Mold Breaker, lets it hit Rotom-W, which is a huge threat to Ground teams, and bypass Sturdy. It gets two strong STAB attacks in Earthquake and Iron Head and has access to coverage like X-Scissor and Rock Slide, forming a pseudo-EdgeQuake combination. Furthermore, it gets Rapid Spin, making it the only viable Pokemon that can remove entry hazards on Ground teams. To further improve its set diversity, Excadrill also has the potential to run a Swords Dance + Z-Move set, allowing it to break through walls such as Gliscor. Excadrill's Steel typing makes it an excellent offensive check to Ice-types that also takes neutral damage from Grass-type moves. However, after getting up sand, the player is sometimes forced to make sacrifices in order to bring Excadrill in, which can result in a huge loss of momentum. Furthermore, Excadrill's Speed isn't amazing outside of sand, leaving it vulnerable to revenge killers. Its typing leaves it weak to quite a few priority moves, including Mach Punch and Aqua Jet. Overall, Excadrill is a necessity on any offensive sand team and effectively performs the role of a revenge killer on non-sand teams.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Excadrill claims the spot of the premier Choice Scarf user on Steel teams due to its excellent Ground / Steel typing. This allows it to revenge kill threatening Fire-types like Rotom-H and Entei along with Electric-types like Xurkitree and Tapu Koko, even being capable of preventing Volt Switch. Further complementing its typing is its excellent offensive movepool. It gets access to superb STAB moves in Earthquake and Iron Head along with Rock Slide as a coverage move that enables it to hit Flying-types like Mantine and Zapdos, which are otherwise capable of taking its STAB moves with ease. Its movepool also grants it Rapid Spin, making it an excellent suicide entry hazard remover, outspeeding and locking itself into Rapid Spin before letting the foe KO it. Its ability Mold Breaker lets Excadrill hit Levitate users, especially Rotom-W, with Earthquake. Bar its immunity to Electric, however, Excadrill's typing fails to bring much else to the table defensively, only adding a weakness to Water, which Steel teams are already vulnerable to. Its damage output isn't very impressive either. Excadrill fails to break through defensive walls like Slowbro and Skarmory and needs team support to take care of such walls before cleaning late-game. Lastly, even when equipped with a Choice Scarf, its Speed is lacking, and it gets outsped by most other Choice Scarf users, such as Victini and Gengar.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is the strongest and most spammable move on this set, with high Base Power and few reliable switch-ins bar Flying-types. Iron Head is Excadrill's other STAB move, allowing it to nab important KOs on threatening Ice- and Fairy-types like Avalugg and Tapu Bulu while also being a more reliable move to lock into when Earthquake isn't safe. Rock Slide rounds off Excadrill's coverage by allowing it to hit Flying-types that can safely switch in on its other moves such as Zapdos, Mantine, and Mega Charizard Y. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to provide entry hazard control for Ground-types, something they usually lack, and become a fast offensive spinner under sand. X-Scissor can alternatively be used, as locking Excadrill in Rapid Spin can sometimes be a horrible idea. X-Scissor gives Excadrill a reliable move to use against Psychic teams, freeing the user from mind games against Slowbro and Latios, as the former resists Iron Head and the latter is immune to Earthquake.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs along with an Adamant nature maximize Excadrill's wallbreaking potential by letting it hit as hard and fast as possible. Choice Band further increases its sheer strength and limits the number of Pokemon that can switch in on it. Life Orb can alternatively be used to allow Excadrill to switch moves while sweeping, but this results in a loss of power and inflicts recoil with each attack, causing Excadrill to get worn down easily. Life Orb Excadrill notably fails to secure a 2HKO on Slowbro. Sand Rush patches up Excadrill's mediocre Speed stat under sand.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Excadrill out of sand can be extremely risky due to its mediocre Speed. Try to take advantage of its wallbreaking potential to the fullest by always using it when sand is up. Try to remove Excadrill's checks and counters like Skarmory before sending it in the battlefield, as bringing it in when its counters are still present can result in a huge loss of momentum and sand turns. After setting up sand through Hippowdon, don't directly switch Excadrill in on strong attackers like Tapu Bulu, as Excadrill's bulk isn't amazing. On the other hand, switching it in on a predicted Toxic or a weak resisted hit is perfectly fine. Try to keep Excadrill healthy throughout the match if you plan on sweeping with it. Once it has taken even a bit of chip damage, it becomes very easy to KO through priority moves. Choice Band Excadrill is an excellent wallbreaker and can be used early-game to break through the opponent's defensive cores before letting a cleaner come in and sweep. Using Life Orb on Excadrill requires a completely different mindset. Such an Excadrill can use more accurate moves to pick off a foe even though it fails to do as much to the foe's teammates, something Choice Band Excadrill cannot. Only go for Rapid Spin if it is absolutely necessary or if the opponent can do very little damage to Excadrill, as Excadrill hates taking strong hits. For example, removing Sticky Web is usually a top priority due to how threatening it is against offensive Ground teams. If Excadrill's sweeping potential is unneeded, feel free to use Rapid Spin while sacrificing Excadrill. Don't prioritize clearing away entry hazards, however, if the opponent can use Excadrill as setup bait.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon is the most important partner for Excadrill, providing sand through Sand Stream to activate Sand Rush. It can also take physical priority moves that threaten Excadrill such as Mach Punch and Aqua Jet while providing Stealth Rock support. In exchange, Excadrill can beat threatening Ice- and Grass-types like Kyurem-B and Tapu Bulu. Gastrodon and Seismitoad's immunity to Water-type moves makes them almost guaranteed partners to take on threats like Kingdra and Greninja. Seismitoad has a better offensive presence, being able to take on threats like Belly Drum Azumarill, while Gastrodon has reliable recovery. Landorus forms an amazing offensive core with Excadrill, providing a special wallbreaker to complement Excadrill's physical offense. It greatly appreciates Excadrill's ability to take out Ice-types as well. Dugtrio excels at trapping and removing annoyances like Keldeo, while Excadrill's Rapid Spin can help preserve its Focus Sash. Mamoswine is another physical wallbreaker that supports Excadrill by wearing down their shared checks. It also provides priority, Ice-type coverage to break bulky Flying-types like Gliscor, and Knock Off support to break through annoyances like Porygon2. Garchomp provides a Fire resistance and the ability to nuke walls with strong Z-Moves. Choice Scarf Krookodile can be used to clean up after Excadrill wallbreaks early-game. It can also Pursuit trap threats like Latios. Finally, Nidoking provides mixed wallbreaking and Toxic Spikes support to make it easier for Excadrill to sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance (Ground)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance lets Excadrill break through defensive Pokemon with boosted attacks. Earthquake is Excadrill's strongest STAB move. Iron Head is Excadrill's secondary STAB move that lets it hit Ground-immune Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Gliscor. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to support teammates such as Focus Sash Dugtrio.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An investment of 252 EVs in Attack and Speed maximizes Excadrill's offensive potential. A Jolly nature lets Excadrill outpace threats such as Choice Scarf Greninja and +2 Modest Mew while sand is up and Pokemon like Nidoking and Mimikyu outside of sand. An Adamant nature can be used to provide more power, but Excadrill will be slower than the aforementioned threats. Sand Rush gives Excadrill a +2 boost to its Speed stat while sand is up. Steelium Z lets it break past defensive Pokemon such as Gliscor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make use of Swords Dance and Excadrill's Z-Move to break through defensive cores such as Mandibuzz + Mega Sableye + Alolan Muk found on Dark teams. Try to time Hippowdon's Sand Stream with Excadrill so you have Swords Dance boosts while sand is still up, which means that you can't be forced out by offensive threats like Keldeo. Try to keep Excadrill healthy throughout the game so it can clean late-game more easily. Excadrill is one of Ground's best tools against Fairy teams, so use it to pressure threatening setup sweepers such as Tapu Bulu and remove wallbreakers like Mega Diancie. Use Rapid Spin to support teammates, particularly Focus Sash Dugtrio, which can trap and remove threats such as Greninja and Tapu Bulu. Use Swords Dance when forcing the opponent to switch into a defensive Pokemon like Gliscor. Avoid being burned by Pokemon like Will-O-Wisp Mew because burns will cut Excadrill's Attack stat in half, leaving it useless against common walls.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hippowdon is an important teammate because it allows Excadrill to make the most of Sand Rush with Sand Stream and provides Stealth Rock support for it as well. Dugtrio is important to remove various offensive threats like Alolan Raichu and defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Zapdos with Gravity up. Excadrill supports Dugtrio by removing hazards for it, and Dugtrio can revenge kill extremely quick threats with Sucker Punch. Seismitoad can take advantage of Water-types for Excadrill due to its ability Water Absorb. Other Pokemon with a Water immunity such as Gastrodon can fulfill the same role as well. Mega Garchomp is great for removing walls like Celesteela, clearing the path for Excadrill. Landorus works similarly to Mega Garchomp, removing walls that Excadrill struggles with. It can also provide Gravity for Excadrill so it can break through Celesteela. Mega Steelix can act as a secondary Fairy check, tanking hits from threats such as Tapu Bulu and removing them with Heavy Slam. Mamoswine is a great check to Flying- and Dragon-types and can pick off weakened Pokemon with Ice Shard, as well as supporting Excadrill with Knock Off, crippling checks such as Porygon2.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's primary STAB move; it hits the hardest and has few reliable switch-ins besides Flying-types. It benefits from Mold Breaker letting it hit Levitate users. Iron Head is Excadrill's other STAB move and hits Grass-, Fairy-, and Flying-types like Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Togekiss for more damage. Rock Slide complements Excadrill's STAB moves well, forming an EdgeQuake combination with Earthquake and letting Excadrill hit Flying-types like Mantine for super effective damage. Rapid Spin turns Excadrill into a fast entry hazard remover, outspeeding most of the metagame and almost guaranteeing hazard removal.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investments along with a Jolly nature maximize Excadrill's revenge killing potential. Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to hit Levitate users like Rotom-W with Earthquake while also bypassing other abilities like Sturdy. A Choice Scarf lets Excadrill outspeed and revenge kill threats to Ground teams like Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set can afford to take hits. Although it takes hefty damage from strong hits, switching it in to revenge kill threats like Grass Knot Tapu Koko and Solar Beam Mega Charizard Y is a good play. That still doesn't justify being reckless with it, though; Excadrill's bulk is poor, and it hates coming on strong hits repeatedly. Try switching it on a predicted Toxic or weak resisted hit. Use Excadrill primarily for revenge killing threats like Tapu Bulu early-game. Locking Excadrill into Rapid Spin is a dangerous play and can cause a huge loss of momentum or lead to the opponent getting a free turn to set up. Only go for Rapid Spin if neither of those situations is likely to happen and getting rid of entry hazards is extremely important. Although this set's main role is to get rid of threats early-game, it can still be used as a late-game cleaner once its checks and counters are eliminated. Be careful when choosing what to lock Excadrill into, as it isn't very strong and can end up being complete setup bait against Pokemon that resist the move it's locked into.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Excadrill fits best on non-sand teams, as there is little reason to not use Sand Rush Excadrill on teams with Hippowdon. Gastrodon and Seismitoad are excellent switch-ins to Water-type moves that Excadrill fears. Furthermore, Excadrill can eliminate Pokemon with Grass-type coverage like Mega Charizard Y and can switch in on a predicted Toxic. Seismitoad has a better offensive presence as well as access to Stealth Rock, but Gastrodon has reliable recovery that helps it take on Water-types better. Landorus can easily eliminate physically defensive walls that Excadrill struggles against like Skarmory and can switch in on threatening Ground-type moves. Dugtrio can trap and remove checks to Excadrill like Keldeo, while Excadrill can preserve Dugtrio's Focus Sash by clearing entry hazards. Mamoswine is an option to break through Grass-, Ground-, and Flying-types that Excadrill hates like Breloom, Hippowdon, and Gliscor. Garchomp and its Mega Evolution excel at luring and eliminating physically defensive walls like Skarmory to support Excadrill. Choice Band Krookodile is an excellent wallbreaker that can wear down the checks it shares with Excadrill. Landorus-T is an excellent setup sweeper that appreciates Excadrill's ability to revenge kill threatening Ice-types. Finally, Nidoking can break through bulky Flying-types like Celesteela and Gliscor with its coverage moves and can set up Toxic Spikes to help Excadrill clean up late-game.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Excadrill's primary STAB option, with respectable damage output and no drawbacks. Iron Head acts as a secondary STAB move, letting it hit Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, which resists Earthquake, for super effective damage. Toxic allows Excadrill to cripple Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz that can otherwise wall it. Rapid Spin provides utility in the form of entry hazard control, freeing up a moveslot that is otherwise used on Defog on teammates like Skarmory. Rock Slide can be used over Toxic as a coverage move thanks to its ability to hit Flying-types like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y for super effective damage, which are otherwise capable of taking Excadrill's STAB moves with ease.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf along with maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature enables it to outspeed and KO major threats to Steel teams, like Mega Charizard Y. Maximum Attack EVs maximize its damage output and allow it to hit as hard as possible. Its ability, Mold Breaker, lets it bypass other abilities like Sturdy and Levitate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Excadrill to revenge kill threats like Mega Charizard Y and Entei early-game, if necessary. Be careful what to lock it into; while Earthquake is highly spammable, it is rarely wise to use it when Flying-types like Skarmory remain. Try removing them before bringing Excadrill in to clean up. Alternatively, using its other moves to nail Flying-types like Zapdos on the switch is fine. However, Excadrill has rather low damage output and fails to break through physically defensive walls like Celesteela and Skarmory, so it should usually be switched out to an appropriate check. Furthermore, an Excadrill Choice-locked into Rock Slide or Iron Head can very easily be taken advantage of. For example, Magnet Pull Magnezone can trap and remove it, eliminating a huge threat to both Electric and Steel teams. Be careful of locking Excadrill into Rapid Spin. Due to its terrible damage output, it generally ends up turning Excadrill into setup bait. Try bringing it in through pivots like Volt Switch Magnezone, as its bulk isn't extremely good, and it is prone to getting worn down quickly. Keep Excadrill healthy throughout the match if it is needed to spin away entry hazards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory supports Excadrill by providing a Ground-type immunity along with entry hazards to make cleaning up late-game much easier. Excadrill, in return, is capable of revenge killing Electric- and Fire-types that threaten Skarmory while providing Rapid Spin support to help retain Skarmory's Sturdy and freeing up a moveslot that could otherwise be used on Defog. Similarly, Celesteela's Ground-type immunity greatly helps Excadrill, and Excadrill's ability to revenge kill Electric- and Fire-types supports the other. Heatran's ability Flash Fire allows it to take Fire-type moves that are super effective against Excadrill. While Excadrill is capable of outspeeding and KOing most Fire-types by itself, faster Choice Scarf users like Victini pose a threat to it, thus making Heatran an optimal partner. Magnezone is another great way to get rid of annoyances. Magnet Pull lets it trap Skarmory, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn, allowing it to get rid of them with ease. Ferrothorn also proves itself to be a great teammate for Excadrill due to its impeccable defensive stats and ability to set up entry hazards. Lastly, Mega Scizor is a great late-game setup sweeper that appreciates the fact that Excadrill wears down their shared checks and revenge kills Fire-types. It can also bring Excadrill in with a slow U-turn, which it appreciates, as it has no means of recovery and dislikes being worn down.</p> "

The Water immunity granted by Seismitoad's ability Water Absorb gives Ground teams room to maneuver around threats such as Choice Specs Keldeo, and Seismitoad also serves as a hard check to dangerous sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill. Modest defenses combined with Assault Vest and a good defensive typing also offer Ground a bulky Ice-neutral Pokemon to switch into threats such as Greninja. Various offensive coverage options allow Seismitoad to threaten Water- and Fairy-types that threaten the team, most notably Azumarill. Access to Knock Off also lets Seismitoad cripple offensive and defensive cores to further support teammates. However, Seismitoad is somewhat passive with mediocre offensive stats and can be easily walled by defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and Zapdos. While fast enough to outspeed most walls, Seismitoad is slower than the majority of offensive threats it is meant to manage and is forced to endure damage whenever checking them. Even with an Assault Vest, Seismitoad is not bulky enough to switch into powerful special wallbreakers such as Latios consistently. A lack of reliable recovery also means Seismitoad can be difficult to keep healthy over a battle. Seismitoad also competes with Gastrodon as a Water-immune Pokemon on Ground, which has better defenses and reliable recovery to consistently check threats such as Keldeo and Greninja. However, Seismitoad is able to check Azumarill, which Gastrodon can't.</p> ",

This set also cannot run the Special Attack investment necessary to check threats such as Azumarill with Sludge Wave.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types resist both of Seismitoad's STAB moves and are usually bulky enough to survive a Sludge Wave, and they threaten to KO Seismitoad in return with their Grass STAB attacks. Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Cradily are especially troublesome, as they easily survive any of Seismitoad's moves and KO in return.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon, Chansey, and Ferrothorn take minimal damage from Seismitoad's attacks and can stall out rain with status and recovery. Araquanid takes little damage from any of its moves and threatens to OHKO in return with Liquidation in rain. Chansey fears being hit by Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Raichu: Alolan Raichu is able to outspeed Seismitoad in Electric Terrain and threatens to OHKO it with Grass Knot. Furthermore, it is a huge threat to any Rain team and has no viable switch-ins, making it a troublesome Pokemon for any Rain team to handle.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Seismitoad struggles to get past bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Mantine, and Mega Gyarados that can then easily remove hazards with Defog or proceed to set up on it. They also threaten to 2HKO Seismitoad in rain with their respective Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters: Mega Charizard Y and Alolan Ninetales are able to get rid of rain with their abilities in Drought and Snow Warning. They can also OHKO Seismitoad with Solar Beam and Freeze Dry, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Residual damage from poison, burn, hail, and sand can prove to be detrimental for Seismitoad, since when coupled with constant recoil from Life Orb, it may put Seismitoad in range of being KOed by priority moves.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Mantine, Swampert, and Rotom-W typically wall Seismitoad by tanking its moves and threaten it in return with status or other attacks that chip away at Seismitoad's health.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Most relevant Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are not threatened by Sludge Wave and can KO Seismitoad with STAB attacks, and those that don't tank it typically outspeed Seismitoad, such as Tapu Bulu and Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Seismitoad is easily shut down by Dragon-types it cannot threaten with Ground-type moves such as Mega Latias, Dragonite, and Hydreigon, which use the opportunity to launch powerful attacks or set up.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Seismitoad struggles to eat hits from powerful wallbreakers such as Latios and Hydreigon and cannot consistently switch into their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Seismitoad isn’t strong enough to break most specially defensive walls in the tier such as Chansey and Mantine, only threatening to remove their items.</p> </section>",

It may, however, be used as a lead to set up Stealth Rock early and dedicate turns with rain to purely dealing damage.</li> <li>Try to preserve Seismitoad against an Electric-type team, as it prevents the opponents from being able to freely use Electric-type moves without having to worry about giving Seismitoad a free opportunity to switch in.</li> <li>It is best to switch out Seismitoad if rain is no longer on the field, as its lackluster Speed and offensive presence without rain makes it very easy to revenge kill. Outside of rain, it should mostly be limited to setting up Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Against Fairy-type teams, Sludge Wave may be used more frequently to prevent Tapu Bulu from being able to switch into it, especially in the absence of rain, where it outspeeds Seismitoad. It can also be used to prevent Tapu Fini from switching in and removing entry hazards with Defog.</li> <li>It is advisable to keep Seismitoad away from Toxic, poison, and burns, as its longevity is reduced by a lot when combined with the recoil from Life Orb.</li> <li>Stealth Rock should usually be set when Seismitoad forces a target to switch fearing a Hydro Pump, especially in rain, as its high Speed in rain would give it a good chance of outspeeding and KOing a hazard remover before it has time to use Defog or Rapid Spin.</li> <li>Knock Off is to be used against walls and Choice item users when it can't do enough damage on its own or in the absence of rain.

Its high Speed allows it to outspeed common threats like Latios and Mega Diancie. However, Scolipede misses out on a lot of important KOs and needs its checks and counters severely weakened to sweep, although Swords Dance can remediate this problem. Its coverage has limited range, as it can't hit common Pokemon such as Celesteela, Gliscor, and Porygon2 too hard. Scolipede also has mediocre bulk and is susceptible to all entry hazards bar Toxic Spikes, which means it can only come in via aggressive double switches or after a Pokemon has fainted.

However, the inability to switch moves is a huge downside that will make it harder for Scolipede to find an opening to sweep.</li> <li>Superpower is an option for Chansey, Porygon2, and other Normal-types, as well as a way to hit for stronger neutral damage on some Steel-types like Celesteela and Skarmory.</li> <li>Poison Jab can be run for a reliable STAB option against Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Clefable; however, it may be pointless if Scolipede’s teammates are already carrying Poison STAB moves, like Mega Venusaur carrying Sludge Bomb and Alolan Muk carrying Gunk Shot. Furthermore, the coverage that Rock Slide and Earthquake grant is far more important to have.</li> <li>Aqua Tail grants Scolipede coverage against Ground-types if need be, for example against Landorus and Diggersby. Pairing this with Waterium Z grants Scolipede a powerful one-time nuke in Hydro Vortex that can allow it to surprise OHKO common defensive switch-ins such as Hippowdon and Gliscor, and most notably against Landorus-T that is OHKOed at +1. However, it is usually not worth using it over its Rock or Ground type coverage, as missing either one of these means missing out on checking crucial threats.</li> </ul> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor can comfortably tank any of Scolipede's attacks and 2HKO it. Moreover, Ferrothorn can set up Spikes on Scolipede, and Swords Dance Mega Scizor can also use it as setup fodder. If it still has its Air Balloon, Heatran is also a massive issue, as it can easily OHKO Scolipede with Magma Storm.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Walls like Gliscor, Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Quagsire can completely shut Scolipede down, the last even having Unaware. Scolipede also struggles to beat threats such as Porygon2 and Staraptor, although they can struggle against a boosted Scolipede.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Entry hazards combined with Life Orb chip away at Scolipede quite a bit and immensely hinder its ability to set up and sweep.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack, Lucario's Extreme Speed, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, can pick off a weakened Scolipede and stop it from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Status: Burn makes Scolipede walled more easily, and paralysis makes it susceptible to threats such as Victini and Latios.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Landorus-T: None of Scolipede's moves bar Aqua Tail touch Landorus-T, whereas the latter can score an easy KO with Stone Edge. Moreover, Scolipede will have its Attack reduced by Intimidate when Landorus-T is sent in, limiting its damage output and sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory easily tanks anything from Scolipede and threatens to OHKO it with Brave Bird while being able to Roost off any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Celesteela all tank Scolipede's attacks and can heal off the damage or fire back with their own attacks. However, Ground- and Rock-type walls must watch out for the odd Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards—especially Stealth Rock, which Scolipede is weak to—Rocky Helmet recoil, and Life Orb recoil severely threaten Scolipede's longevity throughout the game, making it easily revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Scolipede absolutely loathes burn or paralysis, especially since Poison teams usually do not carry Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. Burn will cut Scolipede's Attack by half and further introduce chip damage to it, and paralysis will impede its Speed while also potentially causing it to miss key turns.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Priority attacks are death knells for Scolipede, no matter how many Speed boosts it picks up, as it will likely be annihilated after some chip damage. These include Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack, and Azumarill's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Rock- and Fire-types</strong>: Although Earthquake is super effective against them, common bulky Rock- and Fire-types such as Rhyperior and Torkoal can often take a hit before scoring the KO with Stone Edge and Lava Plume, respectively.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Megahorn is Scolipede's main STAB attack and allows it to threaten walls such as Swampert and Mega Venusaur. It also targets Psychic-types such as Latios and Mew, which could otherwise deal with Scolipede. Earthquake hits Poison-, Steel-, Fire-, and Rock-types such as Toxapex, Excadrill, Heatran, and Nihilego. Rock Slide hits troublesome Flying-types like Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Mantine. Protect allows Scolipede to safely gain a Speed boost and revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Latios. Alternatively, Swords Dance allows Scolipede to muscle through its checks such as Porygon2 and Toxapex more easily.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV investment allows Scolipede to hit as hard as possible and outspeed threats such as Kyurem-B and Excadrill. Life Orb gives Scolipede's moves an extremely important boost in power, allowing it to check threats such as Mega Charizard X and Victini more easily. Speed Boost increases Scolipede's Speed every turn, making it a potent cleaner and revenge killer. A Jolly nature allows Scolipede to outspeed threats like Latios, Victini, and Nihilego. Adamant can also be used, as it lets Scolipede hit harder, notably allowing it to 2HKO threats such as Mandibuzz, Staraptor, and Victini after Stealth Rock damage, as well as Swampert, at the cost of being slower.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Scolipede's poor bulk, it should never be brought it in directly; only bring it in after a Pokemon faints, with an aggressive double switch, or through pivoting moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch. It should set up with Swords Dance when it forces out the foe with its offensive presence. While its primary use is to sweep, it can make use of its ability early- and mid-game to revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Latios, Victini, and Nihilego. Scolipede should only try to set up and sweep once its checks, such as Mandibuzz and Ferrothorn, are weakened. Scolipede's large movepool makes it extremely important in matchups against Flying, Poison, Steel, and Fire teams. Due to this, it should be played conservatively in these matchups. Scolipede shouldn't be sent on the field if entry hazards are up, so using Rapid Spin with a teammate beforehand is recommended. Avoid both burn and paralysis, as they greatly cripple Scolipede and make it much harder for it to clean. As a result, it shouldn't be switched into Pokemon that could cripple it with these ailments, such as Toxapex and Lanturn.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volcarona can deal with the vast majority of Scolipede's checks, such as Hippowdon, Staraptor, and most Steel-types, and appreciates Scolipede's ability to deal with its checks like Chansey. Galvantula and Araquanid are other good partners, as they provide Sticky Web support, which allows Scolipede to outspeed threats like Mew without needing a Speed boost. Galvantula can also deal with some of Scolipede's checks, such as Staraptor, while Araquanid is able to check troublesome Fire-types and can trap and beat some of Scolipede's other checks, such as Celesteela and physically defensive Toxapex. In return, Scolipede deals with some of Galvantula's checks, like Lanturn. Choice Band Scizor, Mega Scizor, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Mega Pinsir can wear down shared checks with Scolipede, such as Gliscor, Celesteela, Hippowdon, Staraptor, and Porygon2. Due to its susceptibility to most entry hazards, Armaldo and Forretress are amazing partners. Not only can they remove entry hazards, but they can also set Stealth Rock or Spikes in the case of the latter, allowing Scolipede to clean more easily late-game. Armaldo is a better check to Flying-types like Mega Charizard Y and provides some utility with Knock Off, which allows Scolipede to get past walls like Toxapex more easily. Forretress checks Rock-types such as Terrakion and can safely bring Scolipede on the field with Volt Switch. It can also set Reflect and Light Screen, making up for Scolipede's poor bulk.</p> "

For example, an Adamant nature guarantees the OHKO on Tapu Koko, as well as the OHKO on Victini and Nidoking after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Life Orb further increases its damage output while allowing Scolipede to hit harder with its coverage moves, without having to lock itself into one move in its bid to clean.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>To start sweeping, Scolipede should find an opening to use Swords Dance. Ideally this means sending it in on a slower threat that it can easily score a KO on, like Chansey, or on a Pokemon that had been weakened prior, where it can force the opponent to switch and gain a free boost.</li> <li>If Protect is used, Scolipede will generally be sent in on a moderately fast threat like Choice Scarf Latios to check it, where it will gain a free Speed boost via Protect and then attack all-out.</li> <li>Always keep your field clear of entry hazards to prolong Scolipede's longevity throughout the game—especially Stealth Rock, which cuts Scolipede's health by a quarter every time it is sent in.</li> <li>Moreover, Scolipede needs to be used conservatively early-game and protected from damage and status, or its late-game cleaning potential will be severely limited.</li> <li>Ensure that Scolipede avoids burn or paralysis at all costs from common users such as Mega Sableye, as either cripples Scolipede's sweeping potential for the rest of the game.</li> <li>As a win condition, it is best that Scolipede's checks and counters are eliminated and the rest of the team are weakened before it can start cleaning.</li> <li>If running Adamant, make sure to scout for Choice Scarf on Pokemon like Latios and Victini, as one Speed boost is not enough to outspeed them and you may be giving up Scolipede to die for free.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Nihilego is a fantastic partner, being able to counter and check other Bug-, Fire, and Flying-types, while also serving as the special offensive presence for physical walls. Choice Scarf Nihilego can take out some threats that Adamant Scolipede cannot outspeed at +1, such as Choice Scarf Victini, while on the other hand, Nihilego with Stealth Rock can set it up to inflict chip damage on the opponent's Pokemon, most notably the Fire- and Flying-types that Scolipede cannot switch into.</li> <li>Toxapex is a great defensive pivot for Scolipede, boasting great bulk and thus being able to switch into some Steel-types like Mega Scizor, and provide Toxic Spikes support to soften the opponent's Pokemon. Toxapex also has the ability to fish for Scald burns to cripple physically offensive Pokemon and help Scolipede sweep late-game, and it also has access to Haze to check setup sweepers.</li> <li>Alolan Muk is a nice partner as it handles Ghost-types that resist Megahorn, while being immune to Psychic-type attacks and providing Pursuit trapping.</li> <li>Mega Venusaur handles some of the troublesome bulky Rock- and Ground-types that can sometimes impede Scolipede, like Hippowdon.</li> <li>Crobat is excellent for hazard removal to maintain Scolipede's longevity through the game, while also being immune to Ground-type moves. It also has some utility options to aid Scolipede in its bid to clean late-game, such as Taunt to stop defensive threats, as well as U-turn to provide momentum for the team.</li> <li>Salazzle can help pressure Steel-, Bug-, and Fairy-types that Scolipede can sometimes struggle against, particularly Celesteela and Skarmory.</li> <li>Nidoking and Nidoqueen provide Stealth Rock support and also help check some physical walls with their plethora of coverage, such as Flamethrower or Fire Blast for Celesteela and Skarmory.</li> <li>Gengar is a great special wallbreaker against physical walls and can check Ghost-types that give Scolipede trouble.</li> </ul> "

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<h1>Grass</h1> <p>Whimsicott performs the role of a fast utility attacker for Grass-type teams. Its Fairy typing and high base Speed let it take on Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type threats to Grass such as Mandibuzz, Kyurem-B, and Mega Gallade. It has Prankster and a diverse support movepool with utility moves such as Encore, Stun Spore, and Tailwind, letting it stop or cripple threatening setup sweepers such as Autotomize Celesteela and Mega Scizor as well as hinder wallbreakers like Victini with Stun Spore. However, Whimsicott suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it will always miss out on important utility moves to support its teammates. Therefore, Whimsicott struggles to do anything meaningful against types like Steel and Poison, which are already tough matchups for Grass. Its low Special Attack results in mediocre damage output, needing some prior chip damage to score a KO on threats like Mega Gallade and Kyurem-B. It can be hard to fit Whimsicott on Grass-type teams due to the issue of tight team slots; almost mandatory defensive and offensive cores leave little room to fit it in. It competes for a slot with Pokemon such as Decidueye and Celebi, which help Grass-type teams circumvent hard matchups like Psychic and Poison, respectively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to turn Whimsicott into a fast revenge killer, outspeeding common Choice Scarf users like Latios and Heracross, but Choice Scarf Whimsicott has low damage output and cannot utilize its colorful support movepool. Knock Off can be used over Encore or Stun Spore that allows Whimsicott to cripple threats to Grass teams, such as removing Curse Alolan Muk's pinch berry.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Excadrill have little to fear from Whimsicott and can easily KO it with their STAB moves. However, Whimsicott can lock Mega Scizor and Celesteela into Swords Dance or Autotomize with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Nihilego, and Nidoking can easily KO Whimsicott. Alolan Muk gets a special mention here because it is not affected by Prankster moves and can use Whimsicott as a free chance to set up with Curse.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Blacephalon, Victini, and Mega Charizard X can easily KO Whimsicott with their STAB Fire-type attacks but should be cautious about Stun Spore crippling them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Pokemon such as Chansey and Jirachi can comfortably switch into Whimsicott and set up Stealth Rock or cripple it with Toxic and Thunder Wave; however, special walls need to be wary of Encore.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority Users: Faster revenge killers like Greninja can easily KO Whimsicott with coverage moves, with Greninja also being immune to Whimsicott's Prankster moves thanks to its Dark-typing.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Encore lets Whimsicott stop walls such as Toxapex and setup sweepers such as Volcarona by locking them into a move, allowing teammates to take advantage of them. Moonblast is Whimsicott's STAB move and used to check threats to Grass-type teams such as Hydreigon and Kyurem-B. U-turn lets Whimsicott gain momentum on forced switches and bring in a teammate safely. With Prankster, Stun Spore allows Whimsicott to cripple threats such as Victini and Volcarona, which makes it easier for the team to deal with. Whimsicott can use Tailwind over Stun Spore to support offensive teammates before fainting by doubling their Speed for a few turns.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Whimsicott to maximize its damage output. Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature lets Whimsicott outrun every Pokemon below base 115 Speed like Latios. Leftovers is used to give Whimsicott a form of passive recovery and let it pivot more freely. Pixie Plate can be used over Leftovers to more easily KO Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type Pokemon. Prankster turns status moves such as Encore and Stun Spore into priority moves, letting Whimsicott fulfill its utility role.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Whimsicott should be switched in against setup sweepers such as Mimikyu and Mega Gallade as they attempt to set up so that Whimsicott can stop them with Encore. However, one should be cautious about switching into them, as it is predictable, and the foe may go directly for an attack and render it weak or even KOed due to its low bulk. Whimsicott can also cripple common walls such as Chansey and Toxapex with Encore, creating setup opportunities for its teammates. Whimsicott should be preserved and used to deal with threats against types such as Dark, Dragon, and Fighting where it can utilize STAB Moonblast. A fast U-turn lets Whimsicott switch to checks against whatever Pokemon is switched in, maintaining momentum. Whimsicott should use Stun Spore to cripple threats such as Volcarona and Victini, though Whimsicott usually ends up sacrificing itself. It can also use Stun Spore after it locks a foe into a move with Encore to paralyze the switch-in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ferrothorn covers Whimsicott's common weaknesses and supports it by setting up Stealth Rock or Spikes, which helps Whimsicott score KOs with Moonblast. Ferrothorn also helps in taking care of Ice-type threats such as Alolan Ninetales and Mamoswine with Gyro Ball. Cradily is a general special wall with access to Stealth Rock that can check Fire-type and Flying-type threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T with Rock Slide. In return, Whimsicott checks Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Gallade and Kommo-o. Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat makes it a crucial switch-in to Ice- and Fire-type attacks for Whimsicott, while Whimsicott helps beat Dragon-types that threaten Mega Venusaur such as Latios and Kyurem-B. Celebi can utilize a Nasty Plot set with Groundium Z to break through Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that wall Whimsicott such as Alolan Muk, Toxapex, Heatran, and Jirachi. Breloom can utilize a Swords Dance set to threaten offensive threats such as Heatran and Hydreigon with Mach Punch and take care of Bug- and Flying-types such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard with Rock Tomb and Focus Sash. Breloom can also use a Poison Heal set with Focus Punch and Substitute to heavily pressure types such as Normal and Steel. Tapu Bulu provides Whimsicott with Grassy Terrain recovery, which is especially helpful if Whimsicott is using Pixie Plate. Tapu Bulu is able to find opportunities to set up with Swords Dance and wallbreak due to Encore, Stun Spore, and U-turn support from Whimsicott. Rotom-C can hold a Choice Scarf and check threats like Mega Pinsir, Crobat, and Celesteela for Whimsicott. Rotom-C and Whimsicott can also form a VoltTurn core that aids in pivoting and keeping constant pressure. Decidueye's Swords Dance set and priority in Shadow Sneak improve the Psychic matchup greatly and check threats to Whimsicott such as Victini and Jirachi.</p> "

Krookodile's good Attack stat and passable Speed stat make it a more prominent lead than Bisharp. Krookodile also has a great offensive typing, granting it almost perfect neutral coverage and the capability to hit several types super effectively with its STAB moves. Krookodile's Ground typing grants it immunity to Electric-type attacks and resistances to Poison- and Rock-type moves. Intimidate is great for softening physical attacks for Krookodile and its teammates, which gives Krookodile a chance to survive moves even when its Focus Sash has been broken. While Krookodile's typing gives it some benefits, it also comes with weaknesses to Bug, Fairy, Fighting, Grass, Ice, and Water. Krookodile's defenses are mediocre, and it relies heavily on Intimidate to prolong its presence on the field against physical attackers. Krookodile's outsped by threats such as Greninja and Volcarona alongside Choice Scarf users such as Heracross. Krookodile is also vulnerable to priority attacks such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, and Breloom's Mach Punch, making Krookodile an easy Pokemon to revenge kill.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is used to assist in pressuring Bug-, Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard X, Zapdos, and Kyurem-B and grants Krookodile's teammates an easier time KOing opposing Pokemon. Taunt prevents foes from setting up entry hazards or using setup moves such as Swords Dance and Substitute. Knock Off is a great utility move, removing items from annoying threats such as Chansey and Porygon2. Earthquake is an excellent STAB attack that deals massive damage to Electric-, Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Tapu Koko, Nihilego, Mega Diancie, and Stakataka.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Krookodile to be as fast as possible so it can Speed tie with Mega Garchomp while outspeeding non-Choice Scarf variants of Excadrill, and 252 Attack EVs maximize Krookodile's damage output, allowing it to OHKO Latios and Jellicent with Knock Off and Mega Diancie with Earthquake. Intimidate lessens damage from the opposing Pokemon's physical attacks, giving Krookodile more staying power and letting it take attacks more comfortably. Focus Sash always allows Krookodile to set up Stealth Rock if it's being used as a lead and lets it revenge kill a foe later in the game if Focus Sash is preserved.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Krookodile works great as a lead to use Taunt on opposing leads that tend to set up entry hazards immediately, such as Skarmory and Hippowdon. Taunt should also usually be used first to prevent passive Pokemon from utilizing status moves and to prevent setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Scizor from boosting. Taunting a foe is also helpful if the opponent decides to switch out soon after, so Krookodile can safely set up Stealth Rock while its Focus Sash is still intact. Preserve Krookodile's Focus Sash against threats it's able to revenge kill effectively, such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko, or if it is needed later in the game. Krookodile should also be spamming Knock Off early-game to remove items so its teammates to have an easier time later. It's a very safe option due to threats disliking the removal of their items. Be careful when using Earthquake if there's a Flying-type or Levitate user on the opponent's team because it can safely switch in. If Krookodile is not being used as a lead, it should switch into resisted attacks it's able to take adequately. Intimidate helps Krookodile better tank physical attacks it resists.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All teammates appreciate Krookodile's ability to set up Stealth Rock, remove items with Knock Off, check the majority of Electric-types, and soften moves from physical attackers with Intimidate. Offensive Water-types such as Greninja and Mega Sharpedo have an easier time KOing threats while Stealth Rock is on the field. Greninja's ability Protean makes it a great check to a variety of Pokemon that would otherwise threaten Krookodile, such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Keldeo, whereas Mega Sharpedo can clean up late-game. With Krookodile as a Stealth Rock user, Mega Tyranitar can play more offensively with Dragon Dance. Tyranitar can help take out Flying-types, which are immune to Krookodile's Earthquake. Hydreigon can switch into Ground-type attacks for Krookodile and can take on Steel-types that Krookodile would have trouble against, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Bisharp and Alolan Muk can take on Fairy-types for Krookodile. Bisharp specifically can check Ice-types, and it can run Swords Dance instead of Stealth Rock with Krookodile's support. Alolan Muk can check Grass-types and also tank special attacks that Krookodile wouldn't be able to handle. Mandibuzz can keep Krookodile's item intact by using Defog to clear entry hazards that would break Focus Sash.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Cofagrigus's low Speed allows it to serve as an effective setter of Trick Room for Ghost teams. Its high Defense stat allows it to comfortably take attacks from threatening physical attackers such as Excadrill and Tapu Bulu and set Trick Room. Cofagrigus is also able to pressure certain types such as Fairy and Normal with a useful entry hazard in Toxic Spikes. Mummy is a particularly useful ability for nullifying abilities against contact move users, which helps against threats Ghost teams would normally struggle against such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Altaria. However, Cofagrigus cannot effectively utilize its own Trick Room due to its lack of damage output when unboosted and overreliance on Shadow Ball.

Its good Defense comes with a horrendous HP stat, which prevents it from being a good check to special attackers such as Latios and Kyurem-B when uninvested in Special Defense.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room is used to support Cofagrigus's slower teammates like Hoopa, Dhelmise, Golurk, and Alolan Marowak by making up for their poor Speed and therefore turning them into potent offensive threats. Toxic Spikes puts pressure on tough matchups such as Fairy and Normal by poisoning grounded foes. Hex is Cofagrigus's only attacking move and allows it to do a lot of damage by taking advantage of the status induced by its Toxic Spikes. Memento allows Cofagrigus to support a teammate such as Alolan Marowak by lowering the opposing Pokemon's offensive stats and bringing said teammate in safely after setting Trick Room.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment along with a Relaxed nature makes Cofagrigus as physically bulky as possible and lets it comfortably switch into physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Alolan Muk, and Scizor while outspeeding foes such as Mega Sableye and Ferrothorn under Trick Room. Darkinium Z powers Memento up into Z-Memento, allowing Cofagrigus to support a worn-down teammate by restoring its health. Mummy is particularly useful for crippling ability-reliant Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Pinsir.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cofagrigus should use its good bulk to look for opportunities to set up Trick Room and Toxic Spikes throughout a match in order to support its teammates. It should generally try to switch in on physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2, as they all fail to 2HKO it. In matchups such as Fairy, Normal, Fighting, and Bug, Cofagrigus should take full advantage of Toxic Spikes by setting them early-game. This is also beneficial for using Toxic Spikes as a way to boost Hex's damage output. However, be wary of Taunt users such as Gliscor, Tapu Koko, and Mew that try to stop Cofagrigus from setting up Trick Room, and switch out to a teammate that can handle said Taunt user. As this set cannot properly take advantage of Trick Room itself, Z-Memento should be used after using Trick Room in order to preserve turns of Trick Room for Cofagrigus's teammates such as Alolan Marowak to take advantage of, and it notably helps if said teammate is significantly worn down. Cofagrigus should aim to cripple Pokemon that are reliant on their abilities to function using Mummy, namely Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Pinsir, as well as other abilities such as Mimikyu's Disguise and Dragonite's Multiscale.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Marowak is the main Pokemon to benefit from Trick Room on Trick Room Ghost teams. Using its low Speed and high damage output, it becomes a dangerous wallbreaker able to dismantle types such as Normal and Steel with Swords Dance. Hoopa's lackluster Speed makes it another potent Pokemon to take advantage of Cofagrigus's Trick Room while also being able to set up Trick Room itself if Cofagrigus ever fails to set it. Mega Sableye is able to check Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Greninja that threaten Cofagrigus and switch in on Taunt users such as Crobat and Mew that prevent Cofagrigus from setting its Trick Room. Mimikyu's Fairy-type STAB move along with its ability in Disguise makes it a perfect check to Dark-type Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Hydreigon that Cofagrigus dislikes dealing with. It is also able to serve as a secondary Trick Room setter that can support the team if Cofagrigus is ever unable to set it. Gengar and Blacephalon are faster offensive Ghost-type Pokemon that are able to revenge kill faster Pokemon for Cofagrigus such as Hydreigon, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y outside of Trick Room. They also appreciate Cofagrigus's Toxic Spikes that gradually wear the team down for them to sweep easier. Golurk provides Stealth Rock support, which helps it by chipping Pokemon that Cofagrigus forces out.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Because of its great typing and massive special bulk, Jellicent finds itself the premier special wall on every balanced Ghost team. Its Water typing in conjunction with its massive bulk allows it to sponge many Water- and Fire-type moves. Jellicent is also able to take on many defensive threats such as Chansey and Gastrodon by using Toxic and Taunt. Alongside this, access to Water Absorb gives Jellicent a useful Water immunity, allowing it to avoid Scald burns. However, while Jellicent's Special Defense may be great, its Defense leaves it open to physical attackers and wallbreakers, and its Speed leaves it vulnerable to stallbreakers such as Mew, which can lock it into Scald with Taunt and cripple it with status moves or Knock Off. Despite all its defensive prowess, Jellicent is very passive, which is why it does not fit onto more offensive Ghost teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Acid Armor can be used to make up for Jellicent's lackluster Defense, but it is only consistent against hyper offense teams. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers, but many other Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Gourgeist-XL make better use of it. Also, Toxic is also mandatory for stallbreaking. Jellicent can consistently set up Trick Room with its huge bulk and recovery; but it cannot make use of Trick Room itself because of how passive it is, so it has to switch out in order to prevent wasting Trick Room turns.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Breloom, and Mega Venusaur can all wear down or knock out Jellicent with their Grass-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu threaten to knock Jellicent out with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-type Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Hydreigon threaten to knock Jellicent out with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Knock Off not only deals a lot of damage to Jellicent, but it also removes Leftovers, resulting in Jellicent being worn down much more easily.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Jellicent's low Defense means physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Dragonite threaten to badly damage it.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Taunt gives Jellicent the ability to break past bulky defensive Pokemon by removing their ability to recover and use status moves. Scald prevents Jellicent from being complete Taunt bait and can be used to fish for burns. Toxic puts bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Mantine on a timer and is used in conjunction with Taunt in order to stallbreak. Recover is Jellicent's only form of reliable recovery and is used to heal off damage whenever Jellicent gets worn down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense along with a Calm Nature allows Jellicent to act as a special wall. 12 EVs are put into Speed in order for Jellicent to outspeed and use Taunt on Celesteela, as well as opposing walls with base 60 Speed such as Swampert, Empoleon, Porygon2, and Clefable. Water Absorb can be used to avoid Scald burns by absorbing Water-type attacks. Leftovers provides Jellicent with longevity, preventing it from being worn down too fast.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In order to preserve momentum, send Jellicent out against special attackers and switch it out from predicted switches. Be careful of using Taunt when there is a wallbreaker on the opposing side, as doing so may freely invite a foe such as Meloetta or Tapu Koko in. Use Taunt and Toxic to wear bulky Pokemon such as Chansey down. Always keep Jellicent healthy so that it can switch into attackers and wall them more easily. Switch Jellicent out in order to scout for Toxic, as being poisoned hinders Jellicent's ability to act as a wall and forces it to switch out in order to keep healthy. If a physical attacker is on the opposing side, try going for Scald instead of Toxic in order to burn it. Try not to stay in on Pokemon that carry Knock Off such as Mew and Shuckle, as losing Leftovers will result in Jellicent being worn down faster.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye is a great team option for Jellicent because of its ability to take Ghost- and Dark-type moves such as Knock Off, its ability to bounce back entry hazards and status moves, and its ability to burn and cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Mega Sableye can be thrown in front of physical attackers because of its higher Defense stat. Gengar can absorb Toxic Spikes for Jellicent, is able to knock out many Grass-types with Sludge Wave, and also appreciates Jellicent's ability to pivot and take attacks. Mimikyu knocks out Dark-type Pokemon for Jellicent such as Mega Sableye and Mega Sharpedo, and uses Jellicent's Toxic in order to wear the opposing Pokemon down enough for a KO. Gourgeist-XL is another partner for Jellicent for its high Defense and ability to take Electric- and Grass-type attacks directed at Jellicent. Jellicent can also take Fire- and Ice-type attacks, such as Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard and Volcanion's Fire Blast for Gourgeist-XL, making them an adequate defensive core. Dhelmise appreciates Jellicent's ability to take Fire and Ice attacks. Alolan Marowak is another great partner for Jellicent because of its defensive typing and ability, being able to absorb Electric-type attacks with Lightning Rod. Its wallbreaking potential also allows it to deal with Mega Venusaur, Alolan Muk, and Ferrothorn for Jellicent, while Jellicent can take Water-type attacks for it. Alolan Marowak sets up Stealth Rock, which Jellicent can take advantage of because of the switches it forces. Alongside Dhelmise, Gourgeist, or Alolan Marowak, Jellicent forms a powerful core due to their combined resistances.</p> "

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola's great HP, useful ability, and decent Defense give it high sustainability during a battle and allow it to be used as a good wall against physical attackers as well as a pivot. With Wish, Alomomola can take hits and heal itself or take advantage of Regenerator by switching out to heal both itself and another member of the team. Even though Alomomola has very low Special Defense, it can use Mirror Coat effectively because of its huge HP stat. Therefore, it can take a super effective special attack and knock out a threat to the team, which is important because Alomomola is only prevalent on stall teams that do not have many ways to deal heavy damage to foes. On top of this, with moves such as Knock Off, Scald, and Toxic, it can reliably wear down teams with chip damage for the rest of your team to take advantage of late-game. As it only fits on stall teams and has no real offensive presence, it relies solely on chip damage and status to deal with its foes. With its lack of secondary typing, it cannot help its team deal with types that have an advantage over Water.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alomomola can take advantage of having Rocky Helmet instead of Leftovers, as recovery is not always needed with Regenerator. Fully physically defensive Alomomola will benefit more from this, as it can also run Toxic and Knock Off instead of Mirror Coat to much more efficiently check physical attackers if you have a wall for special attackers already. Another EV spread of 88 HP / 168 Def / 252 SpD and a Calm nature can be viably used for a specially defensive Alomomola, which is able to always survive a Life Orb Tapu Koko's Volt Switch and Xurkitree's unboosted Thunderbolt, allowing it to safely use Mirror Coat. With a different, even more specially defensive EV spread of 100 HP / 156 Def / 252 SpD and a Calm nature, Alomomola can survive a +2 Psychic Terrain-boosted Psychic from Mew.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Xurkitree are able to fully set up on Alomomola. The Special Defense EVs will not help Alomomola survive many STAB Thunderbolts.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Choice Band Tapu Bulu can get burned and still beat Alomomola one-on-one with Horn Leech and Grassy Terrain. Cradily has Storm Drain, which counters Alomomola unless you are using the Toxic set.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: While Alomomola can beat a lot of physical attackers, some wallbreakers such as Choice Band Diggersby and Dragonite can run right through it. Z-Move users are also threatening, although Protect lets Alomomola take reduced damage. Burning them early-game makes for an easier time.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Any Pokemon that carries Taunt or Substitute as well as a setup move is the biggest threat to Alomomola. Taunt limits its recovery to just Leftovers and Regenerator, and Substitute negates the chance to burn with Scald. Stallbreakers that beat Alomomola include Gliscor, Mew, and Mega Sableye. Anything that carries Toxic can also cripple Alomomola.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Setup Pokemon with Swords Dance, Bulk Up, Calm Mind, Quiver Dance, or Nasty Plot are huge issues for Alomomola, especially special attackers such as Volcarona and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Status: Alomomola's recovery takes two turns to use, so status conditions such as paralysis can stop Alomomola from being able to safely restore HP. Toxic usually forces Alomomola out, often before it can use Wish. As it takes two turns to heal, Alomomola has to deal with two turns of poison damage when healing.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defensive Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Wish is Alomomola's most important move, as it can keep Alomomola and its teammates healthy. Protect allows Alomomola to avoid damage after using Wish, keeping it healthy; it is also a good way to wear down poisoned foes and to gain Leftovers recovery. Protect also gives Alomomola a chance to scout a Pokemon's moveset and to see what move a Choice item user locks into. Scald is used more for its 30% chance of burning the opposition than for its damage. Alomomola uses Mirror Coat as a good way to beat Pokemon it lures in such as Mega Charizard Y and Latios. Knock Off is a reliable move for supporting the rest of the team, as having the ability to get rid of Choice Band and Choice Specs means that it is harder for opposing Pokemon to break a stall team. Removing Leftovers with Knock Off also allows Scald burns to have more effect on opposing Pokemon. Alomomola is the only defensive user of Knock Off, which means it is imperative that it makes good use of the move when on a pure stall team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Alomomola has very high sustainability due to Regenerator giving it the ability to switch into hard-hitting Pokemon multiple times, which is the main reason people use it on Water-type teams. Leftovers is a staple item on most stall Pokemon, as it means Alomomola can outlast other foes, especially with Protect granting it two turns of Leftovers recovery before switching out. Alomomola's HP and Special Defense EVs allow it to take special attacks from Rotom-W, Latios, and Mega Charizard Y to OHKO them back with Mirror Coat. This includes a Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage. Alomomola's 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature turn it into a giant physical wall, allowing it to tank hits from most neutral physical attacks. With this EV spread, it takes less than 50% from most physical threats, which allows it to safely use Wish and Protect, keeping it healthy and letting it get off the occasional Scald or Toxic to cripple the foe. The most notable Pokemon that Alomomola walls are Mega Lopunny and Life Orb Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Alomomola, make sure you switch it in and out as much as possible to take advantage of Regenerator. Note that it is fine to switch out Alomomola at low health, as it will get health back when you next switch it in; there is no need to use Wish to get Alomomola at high HP every time. An important part of using Alomomola as a lure is that you keep Mirror Coat hidden until you're certain that the foe will be attacking, as, once revealed, the opponent can easily play around it, making it a lot harder to use successfully. Make sure you use Alomomola as a pivot to heal up your team as much as possible as well as to check moves from Choice-locked Pokemon. The EV spread it has allows Alomomola to take Volt Switch from every Pokemon that uses it, so make sure you punish opposing pivots by using Mirror Coat on a Volt Switch. Be careful when using Wish and Protect with Alomomola, as it can quickly turn into setup fodder if you are not careful. Using Protect when a foe uses Calm Mind or Swords Dance could result in your loss. Make use of Knock Off early-game to remove items from Alomomola's switch-ins; a great example of this is Chansey and its Eviolite, although challenging Pokemon that wall Alomomola is not advised unless Alomomola is able to use Toxic or Knock Off as they switch in. Take advantage of Regenerator when firing off Scald; allowing Alomomola to get low on health to get a burn is okay if it can safely switch out afterwards. However, try to keep its health high if there is a special attacker that you wish to knock out with Mirror Coat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex is Alomomola's perfect teammate, as it can be given EVs that allow it to take more special attacks and also has Regenerator. This gives the team Toxic Spikes and a Regenerator core, allowing you to cripple the opponent's team without using any moves, with Toxapex's access to Haze also stopping any setup Pokemon from sweeping. Toxapex also has the ability to switch into Grass-types. Alomomola's access to Wish gives it good synergy with bulky Water-types such as Mantine, which is a reliable Defogger that can take special hits and Grass-type attacks for safe Defog. You could even use Lanturn for its safe Heal Bell. Lanturn's immunity to Electric-type attacks and Sap Sipper Azumarill's immunity to Grass-type attacks allow them to be great teammates for Alomomola. Azumarill is even more useful for being able to trap walls that Alomomola can't touch with Whirlpool and take them out with Perish Song. Alomomola pairs well with another physical wall in Quagsire, as it allows Alomomola to use Toxic, Knock Off, or Scald to hinder setup Pokemon while having the safety net of Quagsire's Unaware ability if they get out of hand. Another notable Pokemon that can be paired with Alomomola is Tapu Fini, which can break through other defensive Pokemon with Taunt and Nature's Madness, although Misty Terrain does stop status from Alomomola. Mega Slowbro can set up and sweep late-game after Alomomola has crippled the team with Knock Off and status conditions. Lastly, Suicune can PP stall Pokemon without worrying about being too low on HP, as Alomomola can use Wish to give Suicune health back.</p> "

  "Galvantula": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Galvantula is a great Pokemon on Bug-type teams due to its ability to reliably set up Sticky Web and its great natural Speed tier, letting it outspeed or tie with other lead Pokemon such as Cobalion and Garchomp and easily get up Sticky Web early-game. Galvantula's access to Compound Eyes allows it to spam Thunder, an otherwise low-accuracy move. Furthermore, Galvantula's secondary Electric typing allows it to improve some of Bug's tougher matchups such as Flying and Water while also allowing it to threaten a good majority of Defoggers such as Mandibuzz, Skarmory, and Mantine. Its access to Energy Ball allows it to hit Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Seismitoad and Swampert, which would otherwise wall it, and Hidden Power Ice allows Galvantula to hit Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Gliscor for major damage, which can otherwise threaten Bug-type teams. However, while Galvantula is used as an offensive suicide lead, its low Special Attack prevents it from doing too much damage to the opposing Pokemon. Galvantula also directly faces competition from Araquanid due to it being a great Sticky Web suicide lead that is able to check Fire-types with Water Bubble and Liquidation; however, Galvantula can check Pokemon such as Mantine, which directly walls Araquanid. Galvantula's poor bulk also allows it to be easily revenge killed by fast wallbreakers such as Life Orb Latios and Choice Scarf Victini or strong Pokemon with priority moves such as Dragonite.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple switch-ins like Zapdos, but losing valuable coverage tends to be difficult to justify. Bug Buzz can be used instead of Energy Ball to allow Galvantula to hit Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Latios that are barely fazed by Thunder, but losing the coverage against Water- and Ground-types is significant. Life Orb makes Galvantula's attacks much stronger; however, the loss of Focus Sash makes setting up Sticky Web much more difficult for Galvantula, which is its main niche.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos can Roost off any damage taken from Galvantula, clear Sticky Web with Defog, spread status, or threaten it with Heat Wave. Galvantula's most powerful attack in Thunder does not even 3HKO Zapdos after Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Tapu Koko can prevent Galvantula from setting up Sticky Web by virtue of being faster and using Taunt. Other leads such as Infernape and Cobalion can also use Taunt on Galvantula if they win the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal: Since setting Sticky Web is Galvantula's main use on a Bug-type team, it doesn't appreciate Pokemon that can easily remove the hazard such as Excadrill and Latios. However, Latios is threatened by Bug Buzz if Galvantula is running it.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Galvantula doesn't appreciate coming in on hazards, as they break its Focus Sash, making it harder to keep up Sticky Web. Entry hazards also eliminate Galvantula's chance to cripple threats such as Victini and Mega Pidgeot if its Focus Sash is broken.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Specially defensive Pokemon that can clear hazards, spread status, set their own hazards, or easily shrug off Galvantula's attacks are problematic. Ferrothorn and Cradily can set hazards up, making it harder for Galvantula to keep up Sticky Web. Lanturn is immune to Thunder and can poison Galvantula with Toxic or break its Focus Sash with Volt Switch. Chansey walls Galvantula thanks to its bulk and can easily break it down with a combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic. Mega Venusaur simply just 2HKOes Galvantula with Sludge Bomb and can recover off damage with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: If Galvantula's Focus Sash is broken, it easily goes down to an attack from strong revenge killers such as Latios, Choice Scarf Victini, and Choice Scarf Terrakion due to its pitiful defenses.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Swampert can easily check Galvantula if lacking Energy Ball and threaten to cripple it with Toxic or set up Stealth Rock, crippling its ability to set up Sticky Web again later in the match.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types can consistently set up Stealth Rock against Galvantula and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves. Shuckle can reliably continue setting Stealth Rock and take little to no damage from Galvantula. Faster Rock-types such as Choice Scarf Nihilego and Terrakion can easily threaten Galvantula with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp: Bisharp's ability allows it to take advantage of Sticky Web by raising its Attack stat by two stages after its Speed has dropped and letting it potentially sweep the rest of the team with Sucker Punch.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Sticky Web Suicide Lead (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sticky Web is Galvantula's main niche, allowing it to support the team by slowing down all grounded Pokemon and allowing Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir and Volcarona to sweep with more ease. Thunder is Galvantula's spammable Electric-type STAB move that allows it to hit annoying Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Celesteela for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ice allows Galvantula to dent major threats to Bug-type teams such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Energy Ball allows Galvantula to hit bulkier Ground-type Pokemon, which are immune to Thunder, such as Mega Swampert, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon. These move combinations make Galvantula essential for beating Flying and Water, as Thunder and Hidden Power Ice hit every Flying-type while Thunder and Energy Ball hit every Water-type.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment along with a Timid nature allows Galvantula to outspeed threats like Landorus and act as a fast Sticky Web setter while being able to do some damage with Thunder and its coverage moves. 4 EVs in Special Defense give Download users such as Porygon-Z a boost to their Attack rather than their Special Attack. Focus Sash allows Galvantula to survive any single attack and either set up Sticky Web or attack a threat such as Mega Pidgeot with Thunder if it is intact. Compound Eyes increases the accuracy of Galvantula's moves, allowing it to use Thunder rather than having to rely on a weaker Thunderbolt for its Electric-type STAB move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Galvantula should be used as a suicide lead on Bug-type teams, either to get Sticky Web up to support the rest of the team or to spam Thunder in certain matchups, especially against Flying- and Water-type teams. Thunder can also be readily spammed to fish for paralysis on fast threats that the team might struggle with like Volcarona before it sets up a Quiver Dance. Against Taunt users such as Cobalion and Tapu Koko, Galvantula should set up Sticky Web later in the match after all entry hazards have been removed from its side of the field. Be careful with setting Sticky Web against teams that have Bisharp, as the Attack boost from Defiant will make it a very potent sweeper even after the drop in Speed. When Galvantula isn't used as a lead, it likes to switch in safely against slower foes that barely touch it like Mantine so that it can safely get up Sticky Web. Galvantula also can help break down more annoying Pokemon to Bug teams such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mantine, and Toxapex with its coverage and STAB moves. Galvantula should preserve its Focus Sash to help Bug-type teams check certain threats by either OHKOing them or trying to cripple them with paralysis using Thunder such as Choice Scarf Nihilego, Choice Scarf Victini, and Mega Pidgeot.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Armaldo can clear entry hazards from the field for Galvantula, allowing it to keep its Focus Sash intact to set up Sticky Web more easily. It can also cripple Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini for Galvantula with Knock Off. Galvantula can then take care of Defoggers such as Mandibuzz and Mantine, which try to clear away the Stealth Rock that Armaldo sets. Heracross and Buzzwole both appreciate Galvantula's ability to set up Sticky Web allowing them to more easily clean weakened teams. Heracross is primarily used over Buzzwole due to its better Speed tier and its ability to Pursuit trap threats like Victini for Bug-type teams. Buzzwole, on the other hand, improves matchups against Flying- and Dragon-types due to its access to Ice Punch and Thunder Punch allowing it to easily pick off threats such as Gliscor and Tornadus-T. Mega Pinsir greatly appreciates Sticky Web support, as it is able to outspeed threatening revenge killers such as Victini or threats that naturally outspeed it such as Greninja, which can otherwise be painful for Bug teams to try and handle. Scizor can find good opportunities to safely bring in Galvantula with U-turn while also being able to pick off annoying Rock-types. Scizor can run a Choice Band or Swords Dance to better clean through opposing teams late-game, which is only further aided by the speed support Galvantula provides in Sticky Web. Mega Scizor is also an option with a set of Swords Dance / Bullet Punch / Superpower / Knock Off, allowing it to hit Steel-types like Celesteela that would wall regular Scizor and remove items such as Toxapex's Black Sludge. Mega Heracross, similarly to Buzzwole, makes the Flying-type matchup much easier due to its incredible wallbreaking power, allowing it to muscle past Skarmory, Celesteela, and Zapdos with a combination of Swords Dance, Rock Blast, and Close Combat. Yanmega appreciates Sticky Web, as it allows it to run a Modest nature to make its attacks more powerful, while also providing a way to significantly damage bulky Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur. Volcarona outspeeds most grounded Pokemon including Choice Scarf Excadrill after the drop from Sticky Web while also being able to pick off Steel-, Ground-, and Water-types for the team. Galvantula also picks off Pokemon that Volcarona has a harder time dealing with such as Toxapex and Mantine. Forretress can be used over Armaldo on teams that prefer Spikes support; however, Armaldo can provide Rapid Spin support while easing the Fire-type matchup due to its typing.</p> "

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<h1>Grass</h1> <p>Ferrothorn is a staple pick on Grass teams due to its great natural bulk and fantastic defensive typing, giving it an immunity to Poison-type attacks. Iron Barbs alongside its great natural physical bulk allows it to act as a blanket check to a variety of physical attackers such as Excadrill and punish contact move users such as Alolan Muk and Metagross. Ferrothorn is also blessed with fantastic utility moves in Leech Seed and Spikes; the former allows it to have a form of passive recovery, while the latter allows it to support its offensive teammates by chipping their checks. However, while its Steel typing does offer plenty of defensive utility, it also exacerbates its natural Fire weakness, and with all these amazing qualities, Ferrothorn also has a decent number of drawbacks such as its low Speed stat, which allows it to be easily broken by Taunt users such as Mew, Gliscor, and Hydreigon. Ferrothorn also is held back by the fact that it is dependent on passive forms of recovery such as Leech Seed and Leftovers to stay healthy throughout the match.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Ferrothorn is one of the best defensive Pokemon on Steel teams thanks to its excellent typing and mixed bulk making it an excellent defensive pivot. Its Grass typing makes it a great addition to Steel teams, as it's able to check Ground- and Water-types such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad and resists Electric- and Water-type attacks. Its ability Iron Barbs lets it wear down physical attackers upon contact and potentially break their Focus Sashes and Sturdy, and its great movepool including Spikes, Stealth Rock, Leech Seed, and Knock Off allows Ferrothorn to provide support and utility for its teammates. Unfortunately, Ferrothorn lacks any type of recovery move outside of Leech Seed, which makes it easy to wear down. Its offensive presence isn't that great either, and it mainly utilizes two attacking moves in Power Whip and Knock Off, making Ferrothorn vulnerable to Taunt and potentially setup bait for sweepers. Ferrothorn also lacks Speed, being outpaced by almost the entire metagame. Ferrothorn is vulnerable to Fire-type attacks, which means that it has to rely on Protect to scout the opposing Pokemon's coverage or switch out to a check like Heatran.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p>Toxic can be used over Protect, allowing Ferrothorn to cripple annoying Pokemon such as Zapdos; however, without Protect, it is not as easily able to take advantage of Leech Seed recovery, making threats such as Kyurem-B more difficult to take on. Rocky Helmet can be run over Leftovers to maximize punishing physical attackers. However, Ferrothorn appreciates the extra recovery Leftovers provides. Stealth Rock can be used on Ferrothorn to help its teammates pick up certain KOs, but Cradily is better at setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Gyro Ball can be used instead of Power Whip to damage Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu, Mimikyu, and Togekiss and other Pokemon such as Greninja, Gengar, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B hard. However, Ferrothorn prefers to rely on Power Whip more to hit Ground- and Water-types, and it can't swap out any of its support moves out for Gyro Ball. If using Gyro Ball, Ferrothorn should run a Relaxed or Sassy nature. Toxic is very useful in crippling more defensively oriented Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Mandibuzz that can outlast Ferrothorn due to their recovery moves. However, it should only be used if Skarmory has Spikes and Heatran has Stealth Rock, which puts a strain on teambuilding, and Ferrothorn has no room to run Toxic over its support moves. Thunder Wave supports both Ferrothorn and its team by slowing down faster Pokemon such as Greninja and possibly securing a free turn to attack or set up. Knock Off can be used if entry hazards are provided by Ferrothorn's teammates to grant it utility in removing items from Pokemon such as Eviolite Chansey and Porygon2. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to use over Leftovers and combines with Iron Barbs to spread chip damage to punish physical attackers on contact, dealing more than a fourth of their health and making it easier for Ferrothorn and its teammates to pick them off later.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Grass</h1> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye completely walls Ferrothorn, as it is easily able to tank Gyro Ball, can burn Ferrothorn with Will-O-Wisp, reflects its Spikes thanks to Magic Bounce, and is able to remove its Leftovers with Knock Off. Mega Sableye counters Ferrothorn in absolutely every sense of the word.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Due to its natural quadruple weakness to Fire-type attacks, any Fire-type poses a massive threat to it and can OHKO it with their STAB moves while being resistant to Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Keldeo, and Terrakion can all break past Ferrothorn with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. However, Terrakion needs to be careful, as Ferrothorn can take one Close Combat and retaliate with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt users such as Mew, Skarmory, and Gliscor can prevent Ferrothorn from using its utility moves and can then proceed to slowly wear it down. Mew especially can cripple Ferrothorn, as it can burn it with Will-O-Wisp and remove its Leftovers with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Powerful wallbreakers such as Victini and Choice Specs Keldeo can easily break past Ferrothorn with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Kommo-o can easily set up on Ferrothorn due to its passive nature and proceed to take it out with boosted Fire Fang and Close Combat, respectively.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Attacks: Fire-types resist Ferrothorn's STAB attacks, and its typing leaves it completely vulnerable to them, forcing it to switch out and putting added pressure on Heatran. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Alolan Marowak, and opposing Heatran can easily deal with Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn also needs to be wary of opposing Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage such as Heat Wave Zapdos, Flamethrower Celesteela, Fire Blast Hydreigon, and Hidden Power Fire Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Ferrothorn is also threatened by Fighting-types, as they're able to outspeed it and stop it with their STAB attacks, forcing it to switch out or take a hit. However, Ferrothorn can help apply pressure to Fighting teams because of their lack of an entry hazard remover.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Mega Sableye easily walls Ferrothorn and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, is immune to Leech Seed because of Magic Bounce, and forces Ferrothorn to be careful while setting entry hazards. Gliscor isn't bothered by Ferrothorn's Leech Seed because of Poison Heal and can use it as setup fodder with Swords Dance. Ferrothorn also needs to be wary of Taunt users such as Cobalion, Mandibuzz, and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Grass-types are unaffected by Ferrothorn's Leech Seed and take little damage from Power Whip. Mega Venusaur carries Hidden Power Fire, which is able to 2HKO Ferrothorn. Celebi can set up Nasty Plot on Ferrothorn and KO it with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Sweepers: Volcarona can utilize Ferrothorn as setup fodder with Quiver Dance and KO it with Fiery Dance. Bisharp and Landorus-T can take advantage of Ferrothorn's passiveness by using Swords Dance and proceeding to sweep.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's only attacking move and allows it to check Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie. Spikes provides residual chip damage each time a foe switches in, granting Ferrothorn's offensive teammates such as Tapu Bulu and Celebi an easier time cleaning late-game. Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's main form of recovery and allows it to regain health throughout the match. Protect allows Ferrothorn to scout Choice-locked attackers, such as Dragonite, while also being able to extend recovery turns from Leech Seed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 168 Defense EVs alongside a Relaxed nature allows Ferrothorn to take a Close Combat from Mega Gallade at full health. A Relaxed nature also increases the power of its Gyro Ball. 88 EVs are then placed into Special Defense to allow it to avoid the 2HKO from Kyurem-B's Ice Beam while increasing its overall special bulk. Iron Barbs allows Ferrothorn to punish physical attackers by chipping them each time they use a contact move. Leftovers is Ferrothorn's second form of residual recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>To keep Ferrothorn healthy throughout the entire match, it should spam Leech Seed. Alongside spamming Leech Seed, it should use Protect as often as possible to maximize Leech Seed's recovery. Protect should also be used to scout attacks throughout the match from Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Dragonite and Greninja, allowing Ferrothorn to switch into the appropriate teammate without risk. On the same note, if you predict a switch, Ferrothorn should use Leech Seed to maximize its turns of recovery. It should go without saying, since it provides so many important defensive qualities for Grass teams such as being immune to Poison-type attacks and neutral to Ice-type attacks, so it should be kept healthy through the match as well as possible. Ferrothorn should take advantage of opportunities when the foe cannot do much damage to it by setting up Spikes. However, if Spikes does not have an impact on the match, Ferrothorn should use Leech Seed or Gyro Ball on foes such as Mantine on Flying teams. Ferrothorn should avoid losing its item through Knock Off or Trick, as it depends on Leftovers to stay healthy throughout the match. While most Pokemon should try to stay away from status, Ferrothorn should be used as the team's switch-in to Thunder Wave, as once it is paralyzed, the power of Gyro Ball significantly increases. However, Ferrothorn should avoid being burned by moves such as Scald and Will-O-Wisp which negates its Leftovers recovery and reduces the power of Gyro Ball, making it far too passive. Ferrothorn is a key Pokemon to the team in matchups such against Steel and Electric; as such, do not allow Ferrothorn to be trapped by Magnet Pull users such as Alolan Golem and Magnezone. To avoid being trapped, it should switch out immediately to a teammate that can check these Pokemon such as Breloom, rather than staying in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn form an impressive defensive and anti-Fairy core together. Mega Venusaur also provides Ferrothorn with an additional Leech Seed support and the ability to check threats such as Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. Thick Fat also allows Mega Venusaur to tank attacks such as Choice Scarf Victini's V-create, which would otherwise OHKO Ferrothorn. With Stealth Rock, Cradily forms the other part of the entry hazard stacking core with Ferrothorn and is also the designated special sponge of the team, being able to tank a hit from Pokemon such as Volcarona and proceed to OHKO it with Rock Slide. Cradily also provides neutrality to Fire-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks for Ferrothorn such as Heatran's Magma Storm. Breloom can put threats to sleep with Spore and act as an emergency check to Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir with its Focus Sash intact thanks to Rock Tomb. It also appreciates Ferrothorn's ability to wear down other Pokemon with Spikes and Leech Seed, allowing it to clean more easily late-game in matchups such as Ice with Mach Punch. Tapu Bulu is the team's revenge killer and fastest Pokemon with Choice Scarf, being able to take on threats such as unboosted Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y with Stone Edge and Heatran and Kyurem-B with Superpower. Ferrothorn also appreciates the support it brings through Grassy Terrain, giving it another form of residual recovery and enabling it to check threats such as Choice Band Excadrill more easily. Celebi is the team's special wallbreaker, appreciating Ferrothorn's Leech Seed support giving it a minor form of recovery while setting up and in return being able to take on Pokemon such as Toxapex with Shattered Psyche. It is also able to check threats such as Mega Scizor and Heatran with Hidden Power Fire and Earth Power, respectively. Additionally, Celebi can provide a nuke in Tectonic Rage, which allows it to take on Pokemon such as Toxapex and Alolan Muk for the team. Decidueye can check threatening Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for the team such as Blacephalon and Victini with its priority in Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak. This allows it to become a dangerous setup sweeper in those matchups. Its Ghost typing also provides the team with a means of spinblocking, improving the Bug- and Fire-type matchup.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Power Whip lets Ferrothorn deal substantial damage to pesky Ground- and Water-types such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad that threaten Steel teams. Leech Seed wears down the foe while providing Ferrothorn and its team a form of healing and support. Protect synergizes very well with Leech Seed and Leftovers to stall and recover more health, prolonging Ferrothorn's presence in battle and making it more difficult to take down. It can also be used to scout for any attack that threatens Ferrothorn, especially Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, and enables Ferrothorn to switch out of potential Choice-locked Pokemon to a more reasonable teammate to threaten them out. Choose the last move depending on what your team needs. Stealth Rock can be used instead of Spikes on teams lacking another Stealth Rock setter to make Bug-, Fire-, and Flying-types easier for Ferrothorn's teammates to KO, while Ferrothorn can also set up layers of Spikes thanks to its excellent mixed bulk and durability. Iron Barbs also is a great way of dealing with Rapid Spin users. However, Spikes should only be used if the team already has a Stealth Rock user.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment improves Ferrothorn's walling capabilities, as it needs the extra bulk to tank both physical and special attacks. 72 Defense EVs allow Ferrothorn to survive a Close Combat from Terrakion and Heracross, and 184 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature allow Ferrothorn to tank special attacks more efficiently; Ferrothorn can survive a Focus Blast from Life Orb Landorus after Stealth Rock damage, two Earth Powers from Landorus with Leftovers recovery, and two Ice Beams from Life Orb Kyurem-B. Leftovers synergizes well with Leech Seed and Protect to grant more recovery, which Ferrothorn greatly appreciates. Ferrothorn can also utilize a more physically defensive set with an Impish nature to take physical attacks more effectively; however, Ferrothorn prefers to be more specially defensive to switch into Water- and Electric-type attacks such as Scald and Thunderbolt more easily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to its defensive typing and bulk, Ferrothorn can function very well as a defensive pivot on balanced teams. Make sure to utilize its typing to switch into predicted Electric-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks. Before switching out, take advantage of Protect to scout the opposing Pokemon's move. For example, Ferrothorn should be scouting for any move that threatens it such as Fire Blast on Garchomp; however, don't use it too much, because the opposing Pokemon can use that as an opportunity to set up. If you're expecting the foe to switch out, set up Stealth Rock or Spikes to rack up some damage to pressure and punish switch-ins; this can be really helpful for Ferrothorn to wear them down even more with Leech Seed later. Ferrothorn should utilize Leech Seed at almost any chance it gets, as it's safe to use and a spammable move to slowly whittle down opposing defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Porygon2 or foes that Ferrothorn can take attacks from such as Tapu Koko. Keep Ferrothorn from being burned, as the status negates its Leftovers recovery and weakens its Power Whip. If your opponent is planning on preserving their threat for late-game, don't be afraid to use Leech Seed again. It's often necessary to have Leech Seed on the opposing side to keep Ferrothorn's health high and chip away at opposing Pokemon's health.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran synergizes well with Ferrothorn because of its Flash Fire ability, and it can check Fire- and Electric-types with Stone Edge and Earth Power, while Ferrothorn can switch into Water-type attacks for Heatran in return. Heatran can also run Stealth Rock to enable Ferrothorn to use Spikes for entry hazard stacking. Similarly, Skarmory can support the team by stacking Stealth Rock along with Ferrothorn's Spikes. Skarmory can also switch into Ground-type attacks to keep Ferrothorn from taking any damage, take physical attacks, and shuffle the opposing team with Whirlwind to rack up damage from Ferrothorn's Spikes, while Ferrothorn is able to switch into incoming Electric-type attacks for Skarmory. Celesteela is an alternative to Skarmory but with more offensive presence, being able to check opposing Steel-types such as Heatran, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and opposing Ferrothorn with Earthquake and Flamethrower. It is also a great special tank to switch into Landorus, which allows Ferrothorn to run a more defensive set with a Relaxed nature to take on physical threats. Together, Celesteela and Ferrothorn can whittle down opposing teams by stalling with Leech Seed and Protect. Choice Scarf Excadrill can use Earthquake to threaten Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Mega Charizard X while being able to hit Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona with Rock Slide. It also functions as a late-game cleaner, so it appreciates Ferrothorn's Spikes support making it easier to sweep. Magnezone can gain momentum for Ferrothorn and its team by utilizing Volt Switch. It also traps annoying Steel-types that Ferrothorn can't hope to damage such as Skarmory, Klefki, and Cobalion, and it can take on Water-types to relieve pressure from Ferrothorn. With Ferrothorn's entry hazard support and Leech Seed, Mega Scizor can have an easier time KOing and pressuring Pokemon with its offensive presence and Swords Dance.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock allows Golurk to support its team by pressuring Flying and Bug teams and getting rid of any potential Focus Sash and Sturdy on Pokemon such as Breloom and Skarmory. It can set up Stealth Rock in most cases due to Focus Sash, which combined with Golurk's offensive presence allows it to take advantage of the switches it forces. Earthquake allows Golurk to deal with Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types such as Excadrill, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Koko. With Dynamic Punch, Golurk can deal with Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Ferrothorn while guaranteeing to confuse the foe, which can buy Golurk and its teammates a couple free turns. Stone Edge provides Golurk with overall good coverage in tandem with Earthquake, letting it damage common Defoggers like Mantine and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment increases the overall damage output of Golurk. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature makes Golurk as fast as possible, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock and inflict damage against slower defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and Seismitoad. Focus Sash ensures that Golurk can at least set up Stealth Rock in most cases and damage slower Pokemon after setting up Stealth Rock. No Guard is used to freely utilize moves with lower accuracy like Dynamic Punch and Stone Edge.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Golurk should be used as a lead against most teams, as its Focus Sash results in it getting at least Stealth Rock up against faster attackers, and it has good matchup against most leads due to its coverage moves. However, if the opposing team has a Magic Bounce user like Mega Sableye, Golurk should wait until it is taken out or weakened to the point where Golurk can KO it and set up Stealth Rock. Golurk should not lead against faster Taunt users like Aerodactyl; against them, send in anti-lead Pokemon like Mega Sableye to prevent Stealth Rock. When against Flying and Poison teams that have reliable Defoggers, it is best to preserve Golurk so it can set up Stealth Rock once the Defogger is taken out by its teammates instead of sacrificing it as a suicide lead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Golurk providing the role of a Stealth Rock setter, Alolan Marowak is free to use a Swords Dance set, with its Rock Head ability negating recoil damage from Flare Blitz, taking on Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Celesteela with its typing and coverage moves. Mega Sableye is a great teammate, as it not only provides Golurk with a crucial defensive pivot from Dark- and Ghost-type attacks but also keeps entry hazards away due to its ability Magic Bounce, allowing Golurk to preserve its Focus Sash in matchups like Dark-type teams where it can revenge kill Pokemon. Jellicent provides Golurk with much-needed immunity from Water-type attacks and resistance to Ice-type moves. It can shut down defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Gastrodon with Taunt. Mimikyu appreciates Stealth Rock support from Golurk to score easier KOs, and it takes on Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Dragonite in return. Gengar can act as an effective cleaner and revenge killer, taking advantage of Stealth Rock support from Golurk. It also absorbs Toxic Spikes against matchups like Water- and Poison-type teams, which allows Golurk to retain its Focus Sash. Decidueye acts as a defensive pivot against Ground-and Water-type attacks for Golurk. It can also provide Golurk with Defog support to help preserve its Focus Sash. Blacephalon can snowball against weakened teams due to Stealth Rock support and help in dealing with Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-type Pokemon for Golurk. Hoopa appreciates Stealth Rock support from Golurk to score easier KOs. It can dismantle teams in Trick Room due to its high Special Attack stat and take care of physical walls for the team.</p> "

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dark</h1> <p>Bisharp is a great physical attacker for any Dark-type team thanks to its high Attack stat, access to Swords Dance, and priority in Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch in combination with Swords Dance allows Bisharp to be a very potent sweeper, dishing out strong priority attacks against weakened foes. Its access to Knock Off grants Bisharp great utility by removing opposing Pokemon's items such as Eviolite from Chansey and Leftovers from Zapdos. Its ability, Defiant, helps maintain entry hazards on the field against teams that rely on Defog such as Flying, as they fear giving Bisharp a +2 Attack boost. Its secondary Steel typing grants it a valuable neutrality to Fairy, while its STAB Iron Head allows it to take on slower Fairy-types like Clefable and Azumarill. Its typing also grants it a resistance to Rock and Steel, allowing it to take advantage of Choice-locked Pokemon like Excadrill. However, its Steel typing also compounds Dark's weakness to Fighting-types, allowing it to be easily checked by Pokemon such as Keldeo and Breloom. Furthermore, while Bisharp's middling Speed means that it is able to easily outrun slow Pokemon like Azumarill and Mega Venusaur, it is also easily outsped by most offensive Pokemon in the tier such as Hydreigon and Tapu Koko. However, its mediocre Speed is made up with its access to Sucker Punch, which enables it to check many faster foes such as Victini and Alolan Raichu.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Bisharp is an effective setup sweeper on Steel teams because of its ability to set up using Swords Dance and do massive damage with its STAB attacks. It is extremely useful in matchups such as Poison, where it can threaten to dismantle the entire team using its boosted attacks and Z-Move. Bisharp's Dark-type STAB moves also allow it to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Victini and Blacephalon for super effective damage. Defensively, its Dark typing allows it to set up on a wider array of Pokemon such as Latios and Alolan Muk and prevents it from being crippled by Prankster users such as Klefki. Steel teams appreciate Bisharp's access to a strong priority move in Sucker Punch, as it allows Bisharp to pick off threats such as Victini, Alolan Raichu, and Blacephalon that Steel would otherwise have trouble dealing with. Sucker Punch also makes Bisharp a perfect fit on hyper offensive teams that tend to stack priority attacks to keep faster foes in check. Defiant allows Bisharp to pressure Pokemon such as Mantine and Staraptor from using Defog in fear of giving Bisharp an Attack boost, which is particularly good for Steel teams in order to keep Stealth Rock and multiple layers of Spikes on the field; Defiant also comes in handy against Intimidate users and Sticky Web. However, Bisharp's lackluster bulk forces it to set up on weaker Pokemon or resisted attacks, as a strong attack will surely knock it down to the point where it will be too weak to set up later. Furthermore, as a result of its lackluster Speed, Bisharp is overreliant on Sucker Punch to hit faster targets such as Mega Gallade and Zeraora.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p>Darkinium Z can be utilized on Bisharp to tackle defensive foes such as Toxapex and Mega Sableye; however, Bisharp is significantly weaker without a Life Orb, reducing its capabilities to revenge kill with Sucker Punch. Lum Berry can be used in order to freely set up Swords Dance on opposing Pokemon that threaten to burn or paralyze Bisharp such as Mantine and Slowbro, but it is more situational and forces Bisharp to get a boost in Attack to have good damage output.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>A Jolly nature can be used on Bisharp in order to outspeed Adamant Dragonite and Adamant Diggersby. However, Bisharp appreciates the additional power from an Adamant nature, as it lets Bisharp KO foes such as Celesteela with a Swords Dance-boosted Black Hole Eclipse. Black Glasses boosts the power of Bisharp's Dark-type attacks while preventing Bisharp from getting worn down from Life Orb's recoil. A Lum Berry is able to cure Bisharp if it ever does happen to get afflicted with a status condition, which is particularly useful for taking on status inducers such as Will-O-Wisp Mew. However, Lum Berry is a fairly situational item, and Bisharp appreciates boosting items that give it the necessary power to sweep. Choice Scarf with Pursuit allows Bisharp to outspeed, pick off, and trap faster Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and -1 Victini. However, Bisharp's Speed stat is rather low for a Choice Scarf user, and it fails to outspeed faster Pokemon, namely Tapu Koko, even when holding a Choice Scarf.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Common Fighting-types like Keldeo, Infernape, and Terrakion all outspeed and threaten to OHKO Bisharp while taking little damage from Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus outspeed and OHKO Bisharp, while slower Ground-types such as Hippowdon can tank hits from Bisharp and OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Common Fire-types like Mega Charizard X and Heatran outspeed Bisharp and threaten to OHKO it with their powerful Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: While Bisharp threatens faster foes with Sucker Punch, faster Pokemon that resist Dark such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Greninja take little damage from Sucker Punch and threaten to KO Bisharp with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: Common Substitute users like Mega Gyarados and Zapdos are able to bypass Sucker Punch and immediately threaten to wear down Bisharp.</p> <p><strong>Burn: As a physical wallbreaker, Bisharp is reliant on its high Attack. Burns halve its Attack, nullifying its function on a team. Therefore, Bisharp should be wary of common Will-O-Wisp and Scald users such as Mega Sableye and Toxapex.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny resist Bisharp's Sucker Punch and are able to OHKO it with their respective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Excadrill outspeed Bisharp and threaten it with their STAB attacks. However, they need to be wary of Bisharp's boosted Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon such as Infernape, Heatran, and Mega Charizard X are able to outspeed Bisharp and knock it out with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Bisharp dislikes being afflicted with status conditions, as burns cripple it by halving its Attack, while paralysis hinders it by halving its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute users such as Zapdos, Salazzle, and Gyarados are a nuisance for Bisharp to deal with, as they are able to avoid Sucker Punch and attack Bisharp safely behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Bisharp has trouble knocking out faster Pokemon that resist its Sucker Punch such as Mega Diancie, Hydreigon, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu without some prior chip damage.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's already high Attack, allowing it to become a very potent attacker. Sucker Punch is a strong priority attack that enables Bisharp to act as a revenge killer and makes up for its lackluster Speed. Knock Off is Bisharp's most spammable attack, removing troublesome items from foes such as Eviolite and Leftovers. Iron Head is another great STAB attack for Bisharp, notably hitting Fairy-types super effectively that resist its Dark-type attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature enables Bisharp to be as strong as possible, while 252 Speed EVs ensure Bisharp outspeeds opposing Pokemon such as Azumarill and Alolan Golem. Defiant grants Bisharp +2 Attack each time one of its stats drop, allowing it to gain boosts on opposing moves such as Defog and Sticky Web. Life Orb further boosts Bisharp's power, allowing it to fire off strong attacks even without boosts. Black Glasses can alternatively be run over Life Orb to prevent recoil damage; however, the lower damage output means Bisharp misses out on potential KOs such as on Victini with Sucker Punch. A Jolly nature could be used in order to outspeed opposing Pokemon such as Adamant Diggersby and Dragonite, but there is a significant drop-off in power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a purely offensive Pokemon, Bisharp is best used as wallbreaker, threatening slower Pokemon such as Porygon2 and defensive Tyranitar. However, Bisharp can also be utilized to revenge kill fast Pokemon thanks to Sucker Punch after they have been weakened into KO range. Sucker Punch can often force mind games; be careful in correctly predicting when to use Sucker Punch to gain a KO, as its low PP is easily lost throughout a battle. Take advantage of Defiant by switching in on Defog users such as Zapdos and Staraptor in order to gain +2 Attack. However, be wary of opposing Defog Pokemon that may try to predict the switch and attack, as Bisharp is easily worn down. Bring Bisharp in on passive or bulky Pokemon that do not threaten it like Chansey to freely boost with Swords Dance. In that same notion, take advantage of forced switches by using Swords Dance against weakened Pokemon that fear a KO by Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Alternatively, utilize Knock Off during forced switches in order to remove items from opposing Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Skarmory that brush off even boosted attacks from Bisharp. Due to Bisharp's lackluster bulk, do not switch it into strong attacks, as it relies on remaining healthy in order to effectively boost with Swords Dance. Instead, bring Bisharp in after a teammate has been KOed. Thanks to Bisharp's Steel typing, be sure to use Bisharp carefully in the Fairy matchup due to its ability to deal with and eliminate Clefable and Choice-locked Tapu Bulu. As Bisharp is completely reliant on its high Attack, be cautious of opposing Pokemon that threaten to burn it with Will-O-Wisp or Scald such as Mega Sableye and Mantine.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As a powerful wallbreaker, Bisharp appreciates having defensive teammates to consistently switch in and absorb attacks. Mandibuzz is an amazing physical wall that it able to absorb attacks for Bisharp while taking only neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks. Mandibuzz can also act as a slow pivot with U-turn to safely bring Bisharp into the field. Mega Sableye is able to provide a Fighting-type immunity for Bisharp as well as reflect entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. Mega Sableye can also spread burns with Will-O-Wisp, granting Bisharp more opportunities to set up against hampered foes. Alolan Muk is a great special tank and is able to take on many strong special attackers for Bisharp such as Tapu Koko and Greninja. It also notably is able to take on Volcarona for Bisharp, OHKOing it with Rock Slide. Tyranitar and Krookodile are able to set Stealth Rock, weakening foes upon switch in so Bisharp is able to break past them more reliably. Hydreigon and Greninja are amazing special attackers that pair very well with Bisharp, being able to break past many defensive Pokemon that otherwise wall Bisharp such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn. Mega Tyranitar and Mega Sharpedo are physical powerhouses that appreciate Bisharp's ability to remove foes' items such as Eviolite and Choice Scarf, granting them more opportunities to sweep through opposing teams late-game.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Swords Dance (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance turns Bisharp into a threatening sweeper. Knock Off is Bisharp's main Dark-type STAB move with the additional effect of removing items such as Chansey's Eviolite, and a boosted Bisharp can use it to knock out Pokemon such as Mantine. Sucker Punch is used in order to pick off weakened threats and hit faster targets such as Excadrill and Mega Charizard Y that Bisharp cannot hit with its other attacks due to its poor Speed. Iron Head is Bisharp's Steel-type STAB move, which hits Fairy-, Ice- and Rock-type Pokemon for super effective damage, along with Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Sableye, and Mandibuzz that Knock Off doesn't hit as hard.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed coupled with an Adamant nature ensure that Bisharp hits as hard and as fast as possible, letting it knock out Celesteela and Toxapex after Stealth Rock chip with its boosted Black Hole Eclipse. Darkinium Z allows Bisharp to use Black Hole Eclipse, an extremely strong nuke that can knock out bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Toxapex after a prior bit of chip damage. If there is already another Z-Move user on the team, Life Orb allows Bisharp to knock out Pokemon such as Landorus with a boosted Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Swords Dance against Pokemon that cannot do much in return to Bisharp such as Choice Scarf Latios. Similarly, use Swords Dance when Bisharp's checks and counters have been worn down into its boosted Sucker Punch's range. Preserve Bisharp's health, as it can come in, set up, and sweep more easily when healthy. Laying down entry hazards before Bisharp comes in is recommended, as Bisharp can use the hazards to sweep more easily as well as pressure opposing Defog users from removing them. Similarly, Bisharp should switch into a predicted Defog in order to gain a boost with Defiant. Avoid foes that can inflict status such as Mew, Mega Sableye, Slowbro, and Jirachi. Bisharp should also be cautious when switching into Defog users such as Mantine and Zapdos, which can afflict it with Scald burns and Discharge paralysis, respectively. Use Sucker Punch on faster Pokemon that Bisharp cannot hit with Knock Off or Iron Head such as Nidoking and Landorus. Be wary of Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu using status moves such as Nasty Plot to cause mind games with Sucker Punch. Similarly, use Knock Off and Iron Head on slower Pokemon that Bisharp is able to outspeed such as Porygon2, Toxapex, and Mantine, as Iron Head hits harder and Knock Off is Bisharp's most spammable attack. Be careful of when to launch Black Hole Eclipse, as it can only be used once, and the opposing team may try to waste the move by sacrificing a Pokemon. Use Black Hole Eclipse on a bulky Pokemon such as Celesteela or Toxapex that Bisharp has trouble breaking through otherwise. At the same time, don't launch the Z-Move against Pokemon such as Mantine and Clefable that are easily knocked out by Knock Off or Iron Head. Use Knock Off in favorable situations where there aren't many drawbacks of doing so in order to soften up the opposing team by doing damage and removing items. For example, if Bisharp is sent out against Choice Scarf Latios, clicking Knock Off is a possibility to weaken an incoming Garchomp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is mandatory on all Steel teams for its ability to absorb Fire-type attacks as well as break down defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Mega Venusaur by trapping them with Magma Storm and preventing their recovery with Taunt. Heatran can also switch in on Will-O-Wisp users such as Mew and Mega Sableye that may try to cripple Bisharp. Ferrothorn appreciates Bisharp's ability to pressure Defog users such as Mantine and Skarmory from freely removing its entry hazards, while its hazards wear Bisharp's checks down in return. Ferrothorn can also use Leech Seed to help Bisharp replenish its health. Choice Scarf Excadrill can switch into strong Electric-type attacks such as Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt for Bisharp, revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, and spin away Spikes to prevent Bisharp from getting worn down. Mega Scizor and Lucario are both good partners for Bisharp, as they are all Swords Dance sweepers with priority, enabling them to wear shared defensive checks down for each other for one of them to sweep through a weakened team. Skarmory and Celesteela both can switch into physical Fighting- and Ground-type attacks for Bisharp with their high Defense stats. Skarmory also is able to pick off Fighting-type Pokemon that give Bisharp trouble such as Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny with Brave Bird; Bisharp, in return, is able to keep Skarmory's hazards intact by pressuring Defog users that try to remove them with Defiant. Celesteela is able to put Pokemon such as Zapdos and Hippowdon that can otherwise check Bisharp on a timer by using Leech Seed and Toxic. Choice Scarf Magnezone can trap and eliminate Skarmory and Celesteela for Bisharp's sweep. It also serves as a fast pivot that can revenge kill faster threats such as Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y and use Volt Switch to bring Bisharp in. Jirachi is a good partner for Bisharp, as it is able to take care of Pokemon such as Nidoking and Suicune using its Substitute + Calm Mind set. Klefki supports Bisharp's setup using its Light Screen and Reflect, while its Spikes also chips Bisharp's checks and counters into its boosted Sucker Punch range, allowing it to sweep with ease. In return, Bisharp can pressure Defog users such as Staraptor that threaten to remove Klefki's Reflect, Light Screen, and Spikes.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Dark</h1> <p>Mandibuzz's access to Defog, fantastic 110 / 105 / 95 bulk, and access to reliable recovery in Roost make it a necessity for every balanced Dark team and even some offensive ones. Its access to good utility moves like U-turn, Taunt, and Toxic only helps it. It also has a good enough Speed tier to revenge kill massive threats like Belly Drum Azumarill with Foul Play. Mandibuzz's Speed helps it against most other walls as well, since it can outpace Pokemon like Mantine and Chansey and shut them down with Taunt. Mandibuzz's slow U-turn is especially amazing, as it gives teammates like Hydreigon the opportunity to break walls. Mandibuzz's great defensive typing and immunity to Ground are huge for Dark, since the type heavily struggles with attackers like Landorus and Excadrill. Its neutrality to Fighting and Bug also allows Mandibuzz to handle threatening Pokemon like Heracross and Mega Scizor. Mandibuzz, when used in conjunction with Mega Sableye and Tyranitar, forms one of the best defensive cores in the tier. The core has the potential to flat out wall a good number of attackers while providing important utility like Will-O-Wisp, U-turn, Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Defog support for the rest of the team. Mandibuzz specifically is able to provide offensive teams with a switch-in to fast Ground-types like Choice Scarf Excadrill and a more reliable way to check Belly Drum Azumarill. It can also provide all of the aforementioned utility as well. However, the Stealth Rock weakness cripples Mandibuzz greatly, especially on Rocky Helmet sets, as being pressured to remove Stealth Rock as well as check attackers like Heracross can be overwhelming. Mandibuzz also struggles to do anything against special sweepers like Calm Mind Mega Diancie and Calm Mind Suicune. Although Mandibuzz has a great Speed tier for a wall, it struggles against faster Taunt users like Heatran and Gliscor. These cripple it with a faster Taunt and wear it down easily.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost gives Mandibuzz a reliable way to heal so that it can more consistently check Pokemon like Heracross thoughout games. Defog lets Mandibuzz clear troublesome entry hazards like Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock for its teammates. Foul Play lets Mandibuzz punish and beat physical setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Azumarill. U-turn lets Mandibuzz capitalize on the momentum it gains when forcing physical attackers out by bringing in wallbreakers like Hydreigon. Taunt gives Mandibuzz a way to punish passive Pokemon like Chansey and Mantine that might try to gain an advantage by setting Stealth Rock or using Defog. Overcoat synergizes with teammates like Tyranitar well and improves Mandibuzz's matchup against sleep inducers like Breloom.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet allows Mandibuzz to more easily punish attackers like Mega Lopunny and chip them into a range where teammates like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Greninja can succesfully revenge kill them. Leftovers can be used instead to help mitigate Mandibuzz's Stealth Rock weakness. 248 HP EVs, 244 Defense EVs, and an Impish nature improve Mandibuzz's physical bulk. 16 Speed EVs let Mandibuzz outpace 252 Speed Adamant Azumarill. However, Mandibuzz can run 96 Speed EVs allowing it to outpace Jolly Azumarill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Play conservatively against types like Bug and Fighting where Mandibuzz is very useful in checking massive threats like Mega Pinsir and Heracross late-game. However, if you need it to check said threats early-game, play very conservatively, using Roost to heal off any damage taken so that it can more reliably check them late-game. If Mandibuzz has Taunt, try to keep it hidden until an opportune moment. For example, instead of using Taunt against walls like Chansey early-game, chip them down and surprise them with Taunt later on when they're more susceptible. Play wisely against dangerous setup sweepers like Swords Dance Mega Scizor and Dragon Dance Dragonite by switching Mandibuzz in and forcing them out with Foul Play. However, play cautiously against a potential Z-Move from setup sweepers like Dragonite by sacrificing a useless teammate so that Mandibuzz can come back in after and successfully stop the threat. To add to the above point, make sure to keep entry hazards off your side of the field at all times so that Mandibuzz can more easily check some of the aforementioned threats. Capitalize on Mandibuzz's weakness to some walls like Porygon2 and Zapdos by using U-turn on the switch in and going to a wallbreaker like Hydreigon that can take advantage of them. You can also use U-turn to pivot out of physical attackers that can't beat Mandibuzz to gain momentum. U-turn also improves Mandibuzz's matchup against stallbreakers and setup sweepers like Gliscor and Calm Mind Mega Diancie, as it can use U-turn to safely bring in a wallbreaker or revenge killer after they use Taunt on it. Don't sacrifice Mandibuzz for momentum against Fairy teams. It is imperative to keep Mandibuzz healthy against Fairy-type teams, as you'll always need it to revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill late-game. If utilizing Toxic, cripple Pokemon that beat Mandibuzz, like Zapdos, on the switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye, when used with Mandibuzz, provides a very strong anti-entry hazard core. In fact, the two of them beat every Stealth Rock user except for Clefable and Mega Diancie. Mega Sableye also absorbs status for Mandibuzz so that the latter can avoid being crippled by Toxic poison. Mega Sableye also beats Pokemon like Mega Gallade that Mandibuzz could potentially struggle against. Alolan Muk provides a switch-in to special attackers like Tapu Koko that Mandibuzz struggles against. It's noticeably helpful against Fairy, where its typing and super effective STAB Poison Jab are useful. Tyranitar provides Stealth Rock support for Mandibuzz so that it can more easily check Pokemon like Mega Pinsir. They synergize especially well thanks to Tyranitar's Thunder Wave, which slows down Pokemon for Mandibuzz's Taunt, and Mandibuzz's Overcoat, which works well with Sand Stream. They also synergize well as far as typing goes, too, as Mandibuzz can help against the Fighting- and Ground-types that Tyranitar is weak to. Mega Tyranitar capitalizes on Mandibuzz's ability to remove entry hazards like Toxic Spikes that trouble it. It also appreciates Mandibuzz's ability to switch into and beat Fighting-types like Heracross. A Life Orb Hydreigon set with Taunt and Roost can take out scary Water-types like Suicune and revenge kill big threats to Mandibuzz like Nidoking and Magnezone. Choice Scarf Hydreigon can be used instead, as it forces out threatening physical attackers like Mega Lopunny. Choice Scarf Greninja can revenge kill wallbreakers like Swords Dance Garchomp that Mandibuzz struggles with. It also appreciates Mandibuzz's Taunt support, which helps it keep its Spikes or even Toxic Spikes up. Mega Sharpedo can be used to beat the Fighting-types like Keldeo and Terrakion that can break past Mandibuzz. Bisharp sets up on walls like Chansey and Skarmory that variants of Mandibuzz lacking Taunt struggle heavily against.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Dark</h1> <p>Hydreigon sports impressive Special Attack and decent Speed, allowing it to function as either a wallbreaker with Choice Specs, Expert Belt, or Life Orb to threaten balanced and defensive teams or a revenge killer with Choice Scarf to threaten more offensive teams. Its Dark / Dragon typing is amazing, having almost perfect neutral coverage against any type except Fairy. Hydreigon can also utilize its typing defensively coupled with its solid bulk, granting it the ability to switch into a handful of types comfortably. Thanks to Levitate making Hydreigon immune to Ground and entry hazards bar Stealth Rock, it's a particularly reliable switch-in to Ground-types. It also has a very diverse movepool with respectable coverage options such as Fire Blast and Earth Power to make it a more potent threat to a variety of types. Hydreigon also has access to U-turn to capitalize on its ability to revenge kill by gaining momentum. Hydreigon can also act as a stallbreaker thanks to its access to Taunt, Roost, and Devastating Drake, allowing it to prevent walls such as Toxapex and Mantine from recovering off damage and severely weakening them. However, it struggles to break through Fairy-types and suffers a huge weakness to them, making it depend more on teammates such as Greninja, Bisharp, and Alolan Muk to remove them. Hydreigon's typing also makes it difficult to deal with priority moves such as Ice Shard and Mach Punch from users such as Mamoswine and Breloom. Hydreigon's Speed is decent but sits below the crowded base 100 Speed tier, meaning it is outpaced by threats such as Mega Gardevoir and Volcarona without a Choice Scarf and outsped and revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Infernape, Latios, and Greninja. While Hydreigon's offensive stats are great and Speed stat is passable, it relies on Choice items to wallbreak or revenge kill effectively, making it more predictable and easy to counter. It has space for only one or two coverage moves, hindering its ability to take on a variety of types in the metagame.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Hydreigon is a powerful special attacker for Dragon teams thanks to its solid offensive typing, extensive movepool, and versatility, being to utillze various items such as Choice Specs to act as a powerful wallbreaker and Choice Scarf to act as a potent revenge killer. Furthermore, Hydreigon is the only viable Dragon-type with access to a pivoting move, U-turn. This makes Hydreigon desirable to keep momentum for Dragon teams. However, while Hydreigon is a solid check to Ghost- and Psychic-types by typing, it has a crippling, compounded weakness to Fairy-types, as they resist its STAB moves. Hydreigon's moveset is also rather predictable on Dragon teams and can easily be scouted for. Lastly, despite having a good Speed tier, Hydreigon is outsped by powerful offensive checks such as Mega Gallade and Keldeo.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p>Flash Cannon is a coverage move that allows Hydreigon to hit Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie, which take little damage from its other attacks. Note that it's preferred on the Choice Scarf set because Hydreigon then outspeeds Mega Diancie. However, despite Fairy-types being common in the metagame, Hydreigon has teammates such as Greninja, Bisharp, and Alolan Muk to deal with them, so Flash Cannon isn't needed as much. Also, Flash Cannon Hydreigon doesn't beat most Fairy-types one-on-one because many are neutral to it. Leftovers can be run over Dragonium Z to allow Hydreigon to better deal with residual damage such as from a burn or Stealth Rock. However, not using Dragonium Z results in a huge loss in power, as Hydreigon cannot as easily break walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon without it.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Hydreigon has no other viable options.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dark</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types can easily shrug off Hydreigon’s STAB attacks. Some, such as Clefable and Mega Diancie, should be wary of Hydreigon running Flash Cannon, however. Azumarill in particular doesn’t mind any of Hydreigon’s attacks and can use that as an opportunity to set up Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey easily switches into Hydreigon, tanks all of its attacks, and can stall it out with Toxic + Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types resist Hydreigon’s Dark Pulse; however, Draco Meteor threatens them. Many Fighting-types have their own ways of dealing with Hydreigon. Choice Scarf Terrakion and Infernape can easily get rid of Hydreigon with Close Combat, Keldeo can KO Hydreigon with Choice Specs Secret Sword, Cobalion survives a Fire Blast and cripples it with Thunder Wave, and Mega Gallade KOes it with either Drain Punch or Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves: Hydreigon sports a weakness to Ice-type attacks, so Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Lapras can threaten it out. Hydreigon also needs to be wary of switching in on Pokemon that carry Ice-type coverage, such as Nidoking and Porygon2.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Speed is certainly high, but other Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Latios outspeed it and force it out. Boosted setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Volcarona are able to KO Hydreigon with Outrage and Bug Buzz, respectively.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill resist Hydreigon's STAB combination and OHKO it with their 4x super effective STAB moves. Mimikyu is especially threatening, as its Disguise can nullify damage from Hydreigon's attacks for one turn so it can then KO Hydreigon with Play Rough. However, Fairy-types must be wary of being surprised by Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can switch in on Choice-locked Hydreigon and threaten to KO it with their STAB moves. However, they must be wary of Hydreigon's Draco Meteor, as they cannot directly switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey, Araquanid, and Mantine are bulky special walls that can switch into Hydreigon's moves and heal off any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Naturally faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Nihilego and powerful priority users such as Breloom and Dragonite threaten to KO Hydreigon with their coverage options.</p> <p><strong>Protect: Because Hydreigon is more likely than not to be holding a Choice item, Protect users such as Celesteela and Suicune can scout the move Hydreigon locks itself into, giving these foes more flexibility to switch out to a teammate that can handle its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Hydreigon relies on its Speed in order to perform its roles as a wallbreaker and revenge killer, so halving that Speed makes it more of a detriment to Dragon teams.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Combined with the boost from Choice Specs or Life Orb, Draco Meteor becomes insanely powerful, KOing or dealing massive damage to threats that don't resist the attack while putting pressure on teams lacking a Dragon-resistant Pokemon. Dark Pulse is more consistent without any drawbacks and provides great neutral coverage with Draco Meteor. Fire Blast hits Steel-types such as Klefki, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast is a nifty coverage move for breaking through Normal- and Rock-types such as Porygon2, Stakataka, and Tyranitar and as well as OHKOing offensive Heatran, but its accuracy leaves much to be desired. Earth Power is an alternative over Focus Blast used to hit threats such as Tapu Koko and Tyranitar while OHKOing Heatran. However, Earth Power misses out on OHKOing Tyranitar, and Hydreigon needs to be very cautious about threats that are immune to Ground when using it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Hydreigon to be as fast as possible. 252 Special Attack EVs increase Hydreigon’s damage output. Choice Specs further boosts Hydreigon’s attacking power to get more KOs. Expert Belt can be used instead of Choice Specs so Hydreigon can attack with no drawbacks. With Hydreigon's well-rounded coverage moves, it can get Expert Belt's super effective damage bonus often. Despite it dealing less extra damage than Choice Specs, Life Orb grants Hydreigon the freedom to use all of its moves at the cost of health after each successful hit.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set concentrates on Hydreigon’s role as a wallbreaker, making it great against defensive teams and bulky attackers. Hydreigon is excellent to use early-game to weaken walls for its teammates to finish off or sweep later in the game. Hydreigon should mainly use Draco Meteor or Dark Pulse unless it’s against threats that resist both of these attacks or take more damage from its coverage moves. However, be careful when using Draco Meteor early because the huge Special Attack drop will force Hydreigon out and provide the foe with a free turn to set up. Dark Pulse is usually Hydreigon’s safest option while saving Draco Meteor for later, and with no drawbacks and a 20% chance to flinch, it’s easily spammable. When equipped with Choice Specs, Hydreigon should be more cautious about using its coverage moves because the opponent can switch in a Pokemon that doesn't mind them to set up. For example, attempting to use Focus Blast on Heatran will force it to switch to defensive Mega Scizor, which is 3HKOed by the attack. If that happens, Hydreigon is locked into Focus Blast, forcing it to switch out. Only use Focus Blast on threats that resist Hydreigon's other attacks or are only KOed by it. Hydreigon should always be careful of Fairy-types on the opposing team such as Tapu Koko on Electric, Azumarill on Water, and Mega Altaria on Dragon because the majority easily walls Hydreigon and can take it out. Despite Hydreigon’s resistances and good bulk, it is still recommended to have it come in safely from U-turn to avoid taking unnecessary damage, as it should stay healthy to continue coming in to wallbreak. With Expert Belt or Life Orb equipped, Hydreigon has more freedom to use coverage moves. Life Orb Hydreigon should avoid switching on attacks at all because its attacks' recoil make it worn down even faster. Hydreigon doesn't lose momentum from using Expert Belt or Life Orb, so it doesn't need to make as many predictions and is less prone to being setup bait. Hydreigon can utilize Expert Belt to bluff a Choice item, as the opponent usually assumes Hydreigon is running Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. Make sure to keep Hydreigon away from paralysis, as the reduced Speed will make it less effective at wallbreaking, while Life Orb Hydreigon should also avoid poison and burns to conserve its precious HP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar and Krookodile provide Stealth Rock support, assisting Hydreigon in getting KOs. Tyranitar can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, which is great for a somewhat slow wallbreaker like Hydreigon. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar pairs well with Hydreigon, as both can dismantle teams. Mega Tyranitar can check Flying- and Ice-types for Hydreigon. Bisharp and Alolan Muk can take on Fairy-types for Hydreigon. Bisharp specifically can also check slower Ice-types that pose a threat and can set up Swords Dance to help Hydreigon break down slower threats. With Alolan Muk’s excellent special bulk coupled with Assault Vest, it serves as a pivot that tanks special attacks. Alolan Muk can also absorb Toxic. Both Bisharp and Alolan Muk can provide Knock Off support to remove items such as Eviolite from Chansey and Porygon2 and Leftovers from bulky threats. Mega Sableye serves as another status absorber for Hydreigon and hazard control thanks to Magic Bounce while being a great switch-in to Knock Off to prevent Hydreigon from losing its Choice Specs or Life Orb. Mega Sableye is also reliable in offering utility such as Knock Off and can burn threats. Mandibuzz is another partner that offers hazard control and boasts impressive physical bulk to tank physical attacks for Hydreigon while checking Fighting-types. Greninja and Sharpedo are great offensive Water-types to pair with Hydreigon. Greninja can check Fairy- and Fighting-types with Gunk Shot and Extrasensory alongside taking on a variety of types thanks to Protean. Sharpedo can gain a Speed boost and Mega Evolve to clean up after Hydreigon has dealt enough damage to the opposing team.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Hydreigon’s most powerful STAB attack and is mainly necessary for KOing threats that do not faint from its other attacks. Dark Pulse gives Hydreigon another reliable STAB move with no drawbacks and a chance to flinch the foe. Fire Blast supports Hydreigon’s reliable STAB moves in hitting annoying Steel-types such as Cobalion, Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor as well as Tapu Bulu. U-turn allows Hydreigon to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and have one of its more suitable teammates take out a threat while also maintaining momentum.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature and Choice Scarf allows Hydreigon to outspeed Mega Latias, Keldeo, and other Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Bulu, Landorus-T, Heracross, and Excadrill. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible. The remaining 4 EVs in Special Defense prevent Porygon-Z from ever getting a Special Attack boost from Download. Levitate is Hydreigon's only ability, which lets it switch into Ground-type attacks bar Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake without taking damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Hydreigon functions primarily as a revenge killer and a solid late-game sweeper, it should come in freely after a teammate has fainted with a slow U-turn user such as Mandibuzz, or with a double switch. Take advantage of Hydreigon’s typing and solid bulk to switch into resisted attacks and Levitate to switch into Ground-type moves, but be wary of switching Hydreigon into coverage moves such as Nidoking's Ice Beam. Make sure to utilize U-turn whenever Hydreigon is at a disadvantage and needs to maintain momentum or when the opponent attempts to switch in a counter to Hydreigon. Choice Scarf Hydreigon can also make use of U-turn as a lead to scout foes, especially those that resist its STAB attacks. Be careful about using Draco Meteor, and try not to use it very early in the game. It destroys Hydreigon’s momentum because the huge drop in Special Attack will leave it setup bait and unable to KO anything else that is healthy. Also be careful when locking Hydreigon into one of its coverage moves because they're quite weak. Try not to have Hydreigon stay in against bulkier threats because this set isn’t built to deal with defensive Pokemon. Hydreigon should avoid paralysis at all times because it ruins its role as a revenge killer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon pairs well with Greninja, as Greninja's offensive presence, Protean, and Speed stat can assist Hydreigon in applying offensive pressure onto teams. It also has an enormous movepool that allows it to check many threats and includes Gunk Shot and Extrasensory, which threaten Fairy- and Fighting-types that Hydreigon struggles against. Mega Sharpedo is another strong Water-type and can take on special walls that Hydreigon can’t break. It also has access to Psychic Fangs, making it a decent check to Fighting-types. Alolan Muk and Bisharp are great partners for Hydreigon, helping its weakness to Fairy-types. Assault Vest Alolan Muk can switch into special attacks, while Bisharp can check Ice-types that threaten Hydreigon. Hydreigon appreciates Mandibuzz’s Defog granting it more freedom to switch in. Hydreigon can also come in safely thanks to Mandibuzz’s slow U-turn. Tyranitar and Krookodile are great users of Stealth Rock, which pressures the opposing team and makes foes easier for Hydreigon to finish off. Tyranitar is also good for checking Ice-types and spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave to cripple faster threats. In return, Hydreigon can cover Tyranitar’s weakness to Ground with Levitate. Mega Sableye takes pressure off Hydreigon thanks to its immunity to Fighting-type attacks. Mega Sableye can also bounce back Stealth Rock and status moves.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's strongest STAB attack and allows it to take on a variety of different Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Rotom-W as well as use Devastating Drake. Dark Pulse is its most spammable STAB attack due to its flinch chance, consistent power, and ability to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Heatran that resist Draco Meteor for decent damage. Roost allows Hydreigon to stay healthy through the match, allowing it to continually act as a stallbreaker. Taunt allows Hydreigon to prevent walls such as Chansey from recovering off damage, prevents infliction of status, and forces them to use their weak attacks, allowing Hydreigon to easily take them on.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment alongside a Timid nature allows Hydreigon to be as fast as possible and to hit as hard as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Kyurem-B. The 4 remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense to give Download users such as Porygon2 a boost in Attack rather than Special Attack. Dragonium Z allows Hydreigon's Draco Meteor to become Devastating Drake, which can help it take on walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon with minor chip damage and outright OHKO Pokemon such as Diggersby. Levitate grants Hydreigon a Ground immunity and prevents it from being affected by entry hazards such as Spikes and Sticky Web. Dread Plate is an item option that gives Hydreigon's Dark Pulse a nice boost in power, allowing it to guarantee the 2HKO on Pokemon like specially defensive Jellicent without Stealth Rock damage, while Life Orb allows Hydreigon to boost the power of both of its attacks, allowing it to pick up the OHKO on Pokemon like Diggersby with Draco Meteor; however, the extra 10% chip damage at the end of each turn makes walls much harder to break for Hydreigon, since it will need to rely on Roost more to stay healthy.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon should only Roost against Pokemon that do not threaten it, such as Toxapex, allowing it to stay healthier through the game. Hydreigon should save Devastating Drake for when opposing threats such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur are weakened and can be KOed. Taunt should be used to keep walls at bay by preventing them from using their recovery, allowing Hydreigon to break them with more ease, as well as to stop bulky setup Pokemon such as Suicune from boosting, as they are easily able to overwhelm the team otherwise. On top of this, Hydreigon should stay healthy through the game so it can continually switch in on walls and break them. Hydreigon should try to avoid status such as Toxic poisoning and paralysis as much as possible, as the former prevents it from staying healthy through the game, while the latter prevents it from outspeeding threats such as Porygon-Z and Diggersby. This Hydreigon set, however, lets in Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny fairly easily, which can be a pain for Dark to face, especially since Mega Lopunny can 2HKO Mandibuzz after Stealth Rock chip. Hydreigon should be wary of Pokemon like that and decide whether it is better to Taunt and Roost or predict the switch and attack to take them out with Devastating Drake. Hydreigon should be wary when trying to take on a wall with an attack that can inflict a status effect, such as Zapdos's Discharge, as the Speed loss makes Hydreigon's job of stallbreaking much harder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of its teammates appreciate Hydreigon's ability to break walls with Taunt and Roost, as well as its ability to take care of threats such as unboosted Kommo-o. Tyranitar provides Hydreigon with much-needed chip damage, as both Stealth Rock and Sand Stream weaken opposing Pokemon, allowing Hydreigon to take on walls such as Hippowdon with Devastating Drake. In return, Tyranitar appreciates Hydreigon's ability to check walls that can easily beat it such as Toxapex. Due to Tyranitar's great natural Special Defense, which is increased under sand, it can take on many special attackers for Hydreigon such as Latios, Nihilego, and Volcarona. Mandibuzz provides Hydreigon with a much-needed neutrality to Fighting-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat and Keldeo's Secret Sword while also being able to Defog away entry hazards. Mandibuzz can also check physical setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor with Foul Play. Mega Sableye and Hydreigon form a very solid stallbreaking core, as walls can not touch Mega Sableye thanks to its Magic Bounce and Recover. Mega Sableye can also spread status such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, further chipping Hydreigon's switch-ins as well as crippling other Pokemon such as Chansey by removing their Eviolite with Knock Off. Greninja is a way of keeping faster foes in check and acts as a check to Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu because of Gunk Shot. Because Greninja also forces many switches and has access to U-turn, it can pretty safely bring Hydreigon into battle. Alolan Muk is a solid and much-needed special wall with Assault Vest that can switch into a plethora of attacks for Hydreigon such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Mega Diancie's Moonblast. Alolan Muk also can act as a setup sweeper with access to Curse and a somewhat reliable form of recovery in Iapapa Berry allowing it to clean through Fairy-type teams with ease. Bisharp appreciates Hydreigon's ability to beat walls that it struggles with such as Toxapex and Hippowdon, allowing it to clean late-game. Bisharp also provides the team with a priority attack in Sucker Punch, allowing it to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Mega Gallade. If Hydreigon decides not to use a Z-Move, Bisharp can use Darkinium Z and provide a one-time nuke to take down walls such as Chansey and Suicune, especially since it can boost its Attack with Swords Dance.</p> "

Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's most powerful offensive option and devastates foes that don't resist it. U-turn is used to pivot out of foes that it can hardly damage such as Chansey and Mantine. Flash Cannon is utilized to lure and take out problematic Fairy-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Mega Diancie. Defog can be utilized over Flash Cannon as a means of entry hazard removal, which also grants teammates such as Mega Altaria and Latios the flexibility to run other sets. Fire Blast can also be used as a means of checking Ice- and Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment, a Timid nature, and a Choice Scarf enable Hydreigon to become a revenge killer, as its boosted Speed stat can let it offensively check incredibly fast foes such as Mega Lopunny. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to prevent Download users such as Porygon-Z from receiving a Special Attack boost. Levitate allows Hydreigon to avoid all entry hazards outside of Stealth Rock as well as Ground-type moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is meant to act as a revenge killer, as the Speed attained through a Choice Scarf allows it to threaten to KO fast Pokemon while also being able to pick off weakened foes. Hydreigon can also act as a late-game sweeper thanks to its natural special power and great coverage moves. Against Fairy teams, try luring Mega Diancie and KOing it with Flash Cannon. If Fairy teams lose Mega Diancie, it's more likely that Calm Mind Mega Latias can set up and sweep them. Hydreigon also provides momentum for Dragon teams through U-turn. This puts Dragon teams in favorable positions to win and should also be used in situations where the foe may switch out into a defensive countermeasure. Avoid being paralyzed, as a halved Speed stat will prevent Hydreigon from acting efficiently as a revenge killer. Watch out for Protect users, such as Mega Sableye and Toxapex, as these foes can scout for Hydreigon's moves and take an appropriate countermeasure. Draco Meteor sharply lowers Hydreigon's Special Attack stat, making it vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade and Volcarona, so be cautious of locking into it. It's also possible to lead with Hydreigon, as it can pivot out of any unfavorable matchups to teammates better suited for handling them while also providing some early momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latios helps to check Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion for Hydreigon. In return, Hydreigon can check bulkier Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Slowbro. Because Hydreigon provides another countermeasure against faster foes, Latios can run alternativesets such as Choice Specs. Mega Altaria helps against specially defensive Dark-types such as Mega Sableye and Tyranitar by threatening to set up and KO them with its Pixilate-boosted STAB moves, as well as against opposing Dragon teams thanks to its immunity to Dragon-type moves. Kyurem-B utilizes its unrivaled mixed BoltBeam coverage in order to break many defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and Mega Venusaur for Hydreigon. Mega Latias can check Fighting-types such as Breloom and Infernape. Additionally, Calm Mind sets are critical against Fairy teams as they can set up and sweep against most of them bar Mega Diancie and Mimikyu. Kommo-o utilizes Clangorous Soulblaze to act as a late-game cleaner and is especially helpful versus defensive cores such as the Normal-type core of Chansey and Porygon2. Hydreigon can offensively come in on Psychic-types such as Latios and Mew for Kommo-o. Choice Band Dragonite is a powerful tool for breaking down many specially defensive foes for Hydreigon, such as Araquanid, Chansey, and Mantine. Additionally, its access to Extreme Speed also enables it to threaten to revenge kill faster foes and priority users such as Mega Lopunny and Mamoswine for Hydreigon. Garchomp is the only viable user of Stealth Rock available to Dragon teams, and the chip damage helps put foes such as Mega Aerodactyl in range of a KO from Hydreigon's attacks.</p> "

Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's most powerful offensive option, threatening to deal massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Fire Blast is used to hit Bug-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Heracross, Alolan Sandslash, and Mega Scizor for massive damage. Earth Power is used to hit Steel-types that take less damage from Fire Blast such as Empoleon and Heatran and also OHKOes unsuspecting Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko if they switch directly into Hydreigon. Focus Blast can also be utilized as better, condensed coverage for Normal-types such as Chansey, Rock-types such as Tyranitar, and Steel-types such as Heatran. However, its poor accuracy can make it more of a liability than an asset.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment paired with a Timid nature allows Hydreigon to hit as hard and as fast as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to prevent Download users such as Porygon2 from receiving a Special Attack boost. Choice Specs enable Hydreigon to do insane amounts of damage with its moves but locks it into using only one move. A Life Orb can be used over Choice Specs in order to use moves freely, though Hydreigon must be wary of the recoil. Additionally, the lessened power prevents Hydreigon from 2HKOing foes such as Armaldo. Levitate, despite being Hydreigon's only ability, is very handy, as it avoids all entry hazards outside of Stealth Rock while also granting it a Ground-type immunity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is meant to break down various walls early-game in order to allow a teammate such as Kommo-o or Mega Latias to set up and sweep late-game. Hydreigon should be preserved against Psychic teams, as it can freely spam Dark Pulse to heavily damage most of them. In the face of foes such as Mega Gallade and Victini, it should be swapped out to avoid excess damage. Hydreigon can also act as a revenge killer due to its decent Speed stat, which is useful against slower threats such as Mimikyu and Mega Garchomp. Try to predict an incoming switch-in with one of Hydreigon's coverage moves if it's utilizing Choice Specs, since it's forcefully locked into the move selected. If the opposing team doesn't have a Pokemon that resists Dragon-type attacks or a specially defensive switch-in, feel free to use Draco Meteor in order to deal massive damage to the foe, though keep in mind the Special Attack drop after using it, as the foe can take advantage of it to use Hydreigon as setup bait. Hydreigon should be mindful of Protect users such as Celesteela and Suicune, as they can scout the move Hydreigon locks into and can make the appropriate switch or countermeasure as a result. Be mindful of paralysis, as a halved Speed stat will prevent it from breaking down slower foes such as Mega Scizor and bulky Zapdos. If Hydreigon is using a Life Orb keep in mind the recoil received by it, as Hydreigon can easily be worn down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Latias uses its incredible bulk, Calm Mind, and Stored Power to threaten Fairy teams and bulky special walls such as Chansey late-game for Hydreigon. Additionally, Mega Latias can reliably come in on Fighting-type moves from Infernape and Terrakion for Hydreigon and recover off any damage taken. Choice Scarf Latios acts as a solid revenge killer for Hydreigon, as it outspeeds and threatens opposing Choice Scarf users or setup sweepers such as Keldeo and Kommo-o. Additionally, it can assist Hydreigon by using Trick on Chansey to cripple it and target and OHKOing Mega Diancie with Hidden Power Steel. Kyurem-B uses its unparalleled BoltBeam coverage to offensively threaten many balance builds for Hydreigon, most notably against the Flying-type core of Celesteela, Zapdos, and Mantine and the Poison-type core of Alolan Muk, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur. Garchomp provides Stealth Rock support that chips away at the opposing team's health, allowing foes such as Celesteela to be put within KO range of Hydreigon's attacks. Mega Altaria can threaten opposing Dragon-types thanks to its additional Fairy typing and also switches into Fighting-types such as Mega Gallade and Keldeo that Hydreigon is weak to. In return, Hydreigon can threaten Steel-types such as Heatran and Mega Scizor for Mega Altaria. Kommo-o uses its combination of Clangorous Soulblaze and Close Combat to threaten the Normal core of Chansey and Porygon2, which Hydreigon has trouble breaking. In return, Hydreigon can switch into Psychic-type moves from Celebi and Mew for Kommo-o and threaten to KO them with Dark Pulse. Dragonite uses its sheer power to break down specially defensive walls that Hydreigon can't easily break, such as Chansey and Mantine. Additionally, Dragonite can also threaten faster presences such as Greninja and Mega Lopunny through Extreme Speed and acts as a powerful revenge killer as a result.</p> "

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Thanks to its great Speed and Special Attack and access to Quiver Dance, Volcarona is the best special setup sweeper available to Bug and is a very reliable wincon against types that Bug has trouble with such as Steel. Volcarona's Speed allows it to outspeed virtually all unboosted Pokemon when at +1 as well as the entire boosted metagame when at +2. Volcarona's coverage options allow it to hit the majority of Pokemon at least neutrally, aiding its ability to function as a setup sweeper. As one of its coverage moves, Volcarona can use Psychic with Psychium Z and Hidden Power Electric to beat some of its checks, including Toxapex and Mantine, and even break troublesome defensive Flying-type cores. However, Psychium Z Volcarona is unable to beat Heatran, making Steel a rough matchup for Volcarona's team. Moveslot constraints force it to choose which coverage would best suit the team, leaving Volcarona's moves exploitable by a variety of Pokemon. Its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock compounds Bug's weakness to it and puts even more pressure on Armaldo or Forretress to keep it off of the field. Its Bug / Fire typing is lacking defensively, leaving it extremely threatened by Rock-type coverage as well as common Water-type coverage. However, Volcarona's typing also allows it to take neutral damage from the Fire-type attacks that can be problematic for Bug. Volcarona's Defense is on the lower end and leaves it weak to physical attackers as well as common priority attackers such as Dragonite and Azumarill. On the other hand, Volcarona has high Special Defense, which is boosted even higher after using Quiver Dance, allowing it to check and set up on weak special attackers such as Clefable and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Volcarona's access to Quiver Dance along with strong coverage options and a decent offensive typing allows Volcarona to be a powerful late-game cleaner, letting it find itself a spot on Fire-Type teams. Its part-Bug typing allows Volcarona to ease Dark- and Psychic-Type matchups, while coverage options like Giga Drain and Psychic allow Volcarona to take on Pokemon such as Swampert and Toxapex. Furthermore, it has an excellent Special Attack stat and a decent Speed stat, which can be further amplified by Quiver Dance, making Volcarona harder to manage as a sweeper. However, its part-Bug typing stacks a Rock-type weakness, making it weaker against Stealth Rock. Volcarona has a low physical bulk, which makes it vulnerable against physical priority users such as Dragonite and Mega Pinsir.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>None of Volcarona's other options are viable.</p> <h1>Fire</h1> <p>Running Psychic with Psychium Z allows Volcarona to beat Toxapex and Nihilego on the switch after Stealth Rock damage.

        "name": "Setup Sweeper (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Quiver Dance is Volcarona's setup move, granting it a +1 boost in Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, allowing it to act as a potent sweeper. Fire Blast is Volcarona's strongest STAB move and is used in conjunction with Firium Z to unleash a powerful Inferno Overdrive. Hidden Power Ground is utilized to take care of Heatran once its Air Balloon has been removed, as it walls Volcarona otherwise. It is also useful for hitting troublesome Rock-types such as Alolan Golem and Diancie when Giga Drain is not used. Giga Drain provides extra coverage and small recovery to aid in the Water and Ground matchups, being able to blast past Pokemon such as Keldeo, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon that resist Fire Blast. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's second most powerful STAB move and is an option over Giga Grain. It is useful in hitting Psychic-types such as Latios and Victini as well as Dark-types such as Hydreigon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Volcarona to be as fast and as strong as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Kyurem-B as well as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Choice Scarf Landorus-T when at +1. Flame Body grants Volcarona a 30% chance to burn foes upon physical contact, crippling physical attackers that risk making contact with Volcarona. Firium Z enables Volcarona to utilize a 185-Base Power Inferno Overdrive, allowing it to break past Pokemon that typically survive a Fire Blast such as Latios and Mega Venusaur when at +1.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Preserve Volcarona's Inferno Overdrive throughout the battle, as it can only be used once. Utilize it to OHKO Pokemon that typically absorb Volcarona's attacks and threaten to wear it down such as Latios and Armaldo. Look for opportunities throughout the battle to set up Quiver Dance, typically against weakened foes or those that don't pose a threat against Volcarona such as Celesteela. In this same notion, take advantage of forced switches and Choice-locked Pokemon to set up Quiver Dance to more easily sweep through teams. Save Volcarona for the mid- or late-game, after its common offensive and defensive checks have been either weakened or removed from the battle. In the Steel matchup, avoiding setting up with Quiver Dance until after Heatran's Air Balloon has been removed, as Volcarona is unable to touch Heatran otherwise, preventing the clean sweep through Steel. Considering Volcarona has a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, avoid bringing it onto the field as much as possible while the entry hazard is up. Volcarona relies on preserving its HP in order to set up and effectively sweep in the mid- or late-game stage of a battle and should thus avoid any unnecessary chip damage as well. Keep Volcarona away from paralysis whenever possible, as it relies on its Speed to outrun and KO opposing Pokemon after setting up Quiver Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heracross pairs amazingly well with Volcarona due to its ability to Pursuit trap Heatran, guaranteeing to pop its Air Balloon so that Volcarona can KO it with Hidden Power Ground as it threatens to KO Volcarona with Stone Edge. Armaldo and Forretress provides Rapid Spin support for Volcarona while also setting their own entry hazards to chip down foes. Armaldo also can remove opposing Pokemon's items, such as Choice Scarf and Leftovers, with Knock Off to help minimize Volcarona's checks. Forretress, on the other hand, can safely bring in Volcarona with a Volt Switch on Pokemon it can set up against such as Celesteela and Magnezone. Scizor and Mega Pinsir help eliminate faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Keldeo thanks to their strong priority attacks, clearing the way for Volcarona to act as a sweeper. Scizor notably can utilize Pursuit to trap and remove Victini for Volcarona after it has reduced its Speed from V-create as well as remove troublesome Rock-types such as Mega Diancie and Tyranitar with its Steel-type STAB attacks. Mega Scizor is another great partner for Volcarona, as they combine to make a great offensive core. Volcarona can remove the defensive checks to Mega Scizor such as Hippowdon, while Mega Scizor can remove the specially defensive checks to Volcarona such as Chansey. Galvantula provides Sticky Web support for Volcarona to slow down opposing Pokemon, granting Volcarona more setup opportunities while preventing faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Nihilego and Keldeo from outspeeding it even at +1. Additionally, Galvantula helps check troublesome Water-types such as Toxapex with its STAB Thunder. Araquanid is a secondary Sticky Web setter for Volcarona that can also check Fire-types that resist Volcarona's coverage moves such as Mega Charizard Y. It also can act as a powerful wallbreaker thanks to its decent Attack stat coupled with its ability Water Bubble, effectively doubling the damage of its Liquidation.</p> "

        "name": "Psychium Z (Bug)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Quiver Dance allows Volcarona to outspeed and threaten Pokemon like Tapu Koko. Fire Blast provides strong neutral hits on walls like Zapdos and Gliscor and beats Steel-types such as Celesteela. Psychic in conjunction with Hidden Power Electric allows Volcarona to beat Toxapex and Mantine, breaking Water-type teams. It also threatens other defensive cores such as that of Flying- and Poison-type teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Timid nature makes Volcarona outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Excadrill after a Quiver Dance boost and Zapdos in general as well as Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y. Psychium Z lets Volcarona get past some of its check such as Toxapex. Flame Body is used for its chance to cripple physical attackers and possibly make them setup fodder.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona should avoid switching into Stealth Rock, getting poisoned, and getting paralyzed to preserve its sweeping potential. It works best mid- or late-game when its checks and counters such as Nihilego, Chansey, and Alolan Muk have been taken care of by teammates like Mega Scizor and Mega Heracross. Against Water-type teams, Volcarona's decent Special Defense allows it to set up safely on Toxapex's weak Scald. It is important to scout the Toxapex set, however, as some sets utilize Toxic. Similarly, Volcarona can set up on defensive Celesteela and Mantine against Flying-type teams, but again it needs to scout for Toxic on Celesteela. Due to lack of Hidden Power Ground, Volcarona should set up only when Heatran is taken out or significantly weakened by its teammates. Volcarona can bluff a Firium Z set by not revealing its coverage move until the right moment, luring its usual checks such as Mantine and Toxapex.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Armaldo and Forretress can not only clear Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin for Volcarona but also set up their own Stealth Rock so that Volcarona has easier time scoring KOs. With Stone Edge, Armaldo can check Fire-types that threaten Volcarona such as Choice Scarf Victini and Mega Charizard Y. Forretress can provide the team with slow Volt Switch pivoting and a neutrality to Rock, allowing it to take on threats like Tyranitar and Terrakion with Gyro Ball. As Psychium Z Volcarona lacks Hidden Power Ground to check Heatran and beat Steel-type teams, Mega Heracross is great teammate. Mega Scizor can take care of threatening Rock-types such as Nihilego, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie, and in return, Volcarona beats Water-types that Mega Scizor has trouble breaking such as Toxapex. Choice Band Scizor also acts as an offensive pivot with U-turn and can trap Choice Band Victini after V-create with Pursuit. Heracross or Buzzwole with a Choice Scarf can revenge kill faster threats to Volcarona such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard Y. Additionally, Heracross can Pursuit trap Victini, while Buzzwole can improve the Dragon matchup. Assault Vest Araquanid can check special Fire-types such as opposing Volcarona and Z-Celebrate Victini. With Wacan Berry and Mirror Coat instead, Araquanid can take out strong special attackers like Tapu Koko so that Volcarona has easier time against Electric-type teams. Additionally, Araquanid and Galvantula can provide Sticky Web support, giving +1 Volcarona the ability to outspeed whole Water teams that use Choice Scarf Greninja. Galvantula can also check Water-and Ground-type Pokemon with Thunder and Energy Ball, alleviating pressure on Volcarona.</p> "

        "name": "Quiver Dance (Fire)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stat by one stage, allowing Volcarona to be a fearsome late-game sweeper. The Speed boost lets Volcarona outspeed Pokemon like Choice Scarf Excadrill at +1. Fire Blast is Volcarona's strongest STAB move and allows Volcarona to deal heavy damage to Pokemon such as Zapdos, Mega Gallade, and Kyurem-B. Bug Buzz lets Volcarona to hit Dark- and Psychic-types super effectively, such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Mega Latias. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to take on Water-, Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, such as Swampert, Rotom-W, Hippowdon, and Mega Diancie. Hidden Power Electric allows Volcarona to beat Gyarados and Mantine.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Volcarona hit as hard as possible while outspeeding Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Kyurem-B. Firium Z allows Volcarona to use a powerful 185-Base Power Inferno Overdrive, capable of dealing significant damage to threats such as Zapdos. Flame Body grants Volcarona a chance to inflict burn on Pokemon that are known for using contact moves, such as Dragonite and Mega Gallade.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona's typing leaves it weak to the common Stealth Rock, which takes 50% of Volcarona's HP on each switch in, as well as the other entry hazards. Therefore, it is best to use Volcarona after a teammate removes entry hazards in order to keep it healthy. Be wary of common status spreaders such as Chansey, Porygon2, and Toxapex. Status conditions, namely poison and paralysis, are threatening to Volcarona and leave it weak against revenge killers such as Terrakion. Use Volcarona's good natural special bulk and Quiver Dance to take advantage of weak special attackers such as Rotom-W and set up on them. Avoid taking unnecessary damage, as it will hinder Volcarona's ability to set up and sweep. Try to use teammates such as Rotom-H and Victini to pivot in with Volt Switch and U-turn. Make sure to eliminate defensive checks like Chansey and Heatran, along with Haze users such as Mantine and Toxapex, before setting up, as those Pokemon can still take on Volcarona even after Quiver Dance boosts. Be wary of common Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Nihilego, and Greninja carrying Rock Slide, as they are capable of outspeeding Volcarona after one Quiver Dance boost and reliably KOing it. Try to set up twice in order to outspeed said Choice Scarf users or seek for better setup opportunities after these Pokemon are eliminated. Use Giga Drain to pick off weakened foes if they are in the KO range in order to regain HP. Note that Volcarona's below-average physical bulk leaves it weak against physical priority users such as Dragonite, Azumarill, and Mega Pinsir. Keep your Inferno Overdrive for Pokemon that can handle every attack from it, such as Gyarados. However, it can be used freely if it doesn't affect the outcome of the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Torkoal makes an excellent partner for Volcarona; its capability of removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin benefits Volcarona greatly, as it is very fragile against hazards. Furthermore, Torkoal's access to Drought boosts the power of Fire Blast and Inferno Overdrive, letting Volcarona secure KOs more easily and be effective even without Quiver Dance boosts. Its access to Yawn also gives Volcarona opportunities for setting up safely. Torkoal also provides Stealth Rock support for the team, which lets Volcarona have an easy time against Flying- and Fire-type matchups. Rotom-H's Reflect and Light Screen lets Volcarona set up Quiver Dance safely, Defog removes hazards for Volcarona in order to let it switch safer and stay healthy, and Volt Switch gives Rotom-H ability to bring Volcarona in the field without taking any direct damage. Its access to Levitate also lets Rotom-H pivot into Ground-type attacks. However, Rotom-H must watch out for Mold Breaker Excadrill. Heatran is one of the most important teammates that Volcarona has; its part-Steel typing allows Heatran to check Pokemon like Nihilego and opposing Heatran and KO them back with Earth Power, and its access to Flash Cannon lets Heatran beat Mega Diancie for Volcarona. Its useful utility moves Taunt and Toxic along with Magma Storm allow Heatran to isolate some of Volcarona's checks such as Mantine and Toxapex and eliminate them, giving Volcarona more opportunities for setting up. Mega Charizard Y is another sun setter that can weaken the opposing team with its monstrous Special Attack stat, allowing Volcarona clean easier late-game. Its part-Flying typing serves as a Ground-type immunity and lets Mega Charizard Y switch into Ground-type attacks safely and retaliate with its Solar Beam. Its Drought also weakens Water-type attacks and let it act as an offensive check against Water-Type Pokemon as well. Mega Charizard X forms a strong offensive core with Volcarona, capable of beating Pokemon like Mantine and Heatran with Dragon Claw and Earthquake. In return, Volcarona can beat Swampert and Porygon2 for Mega Charizard X. Victini's access to Bolt Strike and V-create lets it effectively beat bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Mantine and ease the Flying- and Water-type matchups. It also has access to U-turn, which can be used to bring Volcarona in safely. Infernape is another decent partner that can threaten some of Volcarona's checks such as Chansey, Heatran, and Nihilego after Stealth Rock damage with a powerful STAB Close Combat. Furthermore, its access to U-turn can be used for pivoting as well.</p> "

  "Cobalion": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <p>With its high defenses and Speed, Cobalion serves as an excellent lead and defensive pivot for Fighting-type teams. Cobalion's good Speed tier and access to Taunt and Stealth Rock allow it to lead effectively against opposing entry hazard setters. Additionally, its Steel typing offers many valuable resistances and key neutralities to Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type moves, giving Cobalion ample opportunities to switch into attacks and check Pokemon, such as Latios and Mega Diancie, that threaten Fighting teams. Cobalion's Steel-type STAB Iron Head is also an asset to Fighting-type teams, threatening the Fairy-type Pokemon they're weak to. However, Cobalion is generally passive with its mediocre offensive stats and can only threaten a lot of Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Cobalion's lack of recovery also hurts its longevity, making it difficult for it to switch into threats multiple times over the course of a battle. On a type with poor defensive synergy, Cobalion's weakness to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks is difficult to cover.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Cobalion can utilize more offensive sets that make use of Life Orb or Swords Dance to wallbreak or sweep. However, Cobalion's offensive stats are mediocre and other Fighting-types in the same Speed tier, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, perform this role better. Giving up Taunt also makes Cobalion much easier to deal with for walls, since, even with Life Orb, Cobalion lacks the strength to break defensive Pokemon. Cobalion can also utilize a damage-reducing Berry instead of Leftovers to let it check and disable threats with Thunder Wave more easily. Occa Berry, for example, can be utilized to cripple Choice Scarf or Z-Celebrate Victini. Shuca Berry and Chople Berry can also be used to better manage specific threats. However, the sustained recovery from Leftovers is more useful across a wider range of matchups.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Faster Taunt: While Cobalion has enough Speed to outrun defensive entry hazard setters and leads, faster leads such as Aerodactyl, Crobat, and Deoxys-S can outspeed and Taunt it, preventing it from setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Cobalion struggles against bulky Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Landorus, as most take little damage from its STAB moves, cannot be paralyzed with Thunder Wave, and easily threaten it in return with Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Zapdos and Rotom-W resist Cobalion's STAB move and are immune to paralysis; they can force Cobalion to switch out and then pivot out with their own Volt Switch to generate momentum.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Cobalion cannot manage powerful STAB moves from Fire-types such as Victini, Blacephalon, and Infernape, which often outspeed Cobalion using Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Fast Wallbreakers: Big threats such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade can outspeed Cobalion and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Cobalion is hard walled by Mega Sableye, which takes little damage from any of Cobalion's attacks and bounces back Taunt, Thunder Wave, and Stealth Rock.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock chips Pokemon when they switch in and helps against Fire, Flying, and Bug teams, and Cobalion can set it easily with its high defenses. Taunt prevents foes from using status moves, crippling opposing walls, leads, and, most notably, Defoggers. For example, Taunt is crucial for keeping Stealth Rock in place in the matchup against Flying. Iron Head keeps Cobalion from being too passive while also hitting Fairy-type threats such as Mega Diancie and Clefable for heavy damage. Thunder Wave cripples fast threats and setup sweepers that Cobalion cannot threaten offensively, such as Latios. Volt Switch is an option over Thunder Wave as a way for Cobalion to generate momentum for the team and bring in teammates.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Cobalion to outspeed most opposing entry hazard setters and walls, and full HP investment gives Cobalion the most bulk possible for tanking hits from both physical and special attackers. Leftovers gives Cobalion a bit more longevity with passive recovery. Justified is Cobalion's only ability, raising its Attack by one stage when hit with a Dark-type attack, which is unfortunately largely useless on Fighting teams.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cobalion should generally be used to lead and get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible to support the team. However, given its lack of recovery, it is crucial to preserve Cobalion carefully in matchups such as Dragon and Psychic where it is needed to check threats to the team, such as Latios. If Cobalion isn't needed to check a specific threat, its bulk and resistances can be used to switch into attacks liberally. Send Cobalion in against passive Defog users such as Mantine and Skarmory that it can Taunt and then set Stealth Rock against. Once Stealth Rock has been set, Thunder Wave can be spammed liberally to cripple foes. Iron Head and Thunder Wave can also be used together to paraflinch in a tight spot. Shutting down passive Pokemon such as Chansey and Ferrothorn with Taunt and pivoting out is a good way to bring teammates in safely. This is also important, since, even with Taunt, Cobalion will still typically lose to most walls one-on-one. Volt Switch is best used to pivot on predicted switches, since Cobalion's high Speed make it difficult to bring in teammates safely otherwise.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Given Fighting's offensive nature, nearly every teammate of Cobalion benefits greatly from its capacity to set Stealth Rock dealing chip damage to their checks and counters. Revenge killers on Fighting teams, such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Buzzwole, and Heracross, appreciate the chip damage dealt by Cobalion's Stealth Rock. In return, Terrakion can check the Fire-types that threaten Cobalion such as Victini and Volcarona. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Choice Band Infernape appreciate having foes chipped by Stealth Rock or slowed down by paralysis. Cobalion can also bring these Pokemon in safely against threats using Volt Switch. Setup sweepers such as Hawlucha, Mega Gallade, and Kommo-o benefit greatly from Cobalion's ability to chip checks such as Skarmory with Stealth Rock or provide safe setup opportunities with Volt Switch. Hawlucha in particular appreciates having paralyzed enemies to set up Substitute and ideally Swords Dance on. Breloom is another wallbreaker, providing valuable offensive utility through access to strong priority and Spore, that appreciates Cobalion's ability to bring it in against threats. Breloom, in return, also helps enormously in the Water matchup where Cobalion struggles.</p> "

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Terrakion is a great revenge killer for Fighting, as its high Attack, great Speed tier, and useful STAB combination allow it to take out many threats to the type such as Mega Pinsir and Tapu Koko. Terrakion's high Speed tier allows it to naturally outspeed many fast threats such as Mega Pinsir, Blacephalon, and Nihilego with full Speed investment and a Jolly nature. Thanks to its respectable Attack stat and two powerful STAB moves in Stone Edge and Close Combat, Terrakion can be a great offensive threat against Bug, Flying, and Fire teams. Its movepool also allows it to utilize useful coverage moves such as Earthquake, Iron Head, and Poison Jab, allowing it to deal with a wide variety of Pokemon, with some notable examples being Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Bulu. Terrakion can also utilize a Swords Dance set with Rockium Z to wallbreak against types like Flying, Psychic, and Water. Rock Polish lets it threaten offensive types like Electric. Substitute can be used to take advantage of forced switches and protect it from status moves. This combined with its Rock typing allows Terrakion to take a few Flying-type attacks, which is key against types like Bug and Flying. Terrakion also has decent bulk and can take neutral hits from Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Mega Pidgeot. Despite its defensive merits, though, Terrakion's typing leaves it weak to other common types like Water and Ground. Even with its high-powered STAB moves and Attack stat, Terrakion cannot break past Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Venusaur due to their high Defense. Along with most its teammates, Terrakion is highly crippled by any status ailment, as they always hinder its ability to effectively sweep and revenge kill.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Terrakion is a necessary asset to Rock teams thanks to the plethora of benefits it offers as a sweeper and wallbreaker. With its Rock / Fighting typing, it sports an incredible STAB combination capable of hitting a large portion of the metagame for neutral damage. Fighting STAB in particular makes it a formidable asset in the Normal and Steel matchups. It also has access to helpful coverage in Earthquake, Poison Jab, and Iron Head in order to hit threats like Nidoking, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Diancie, respectively. A base 108 Speed tier allows Terrakion to outspeed important threats like Hydreigon and Volcarona, and with a Choice Scarf, it's also capable of removing faster threats such as Mega Lopunny, +1 Mega Sharpedo, and Sand Rush Excadrill after Sticky Web. With the ability Justified, Terrakion can discourage opposing teams from using Dark-type attacks such as Knock Off, since they'll increase Terrakion's Attack stat. With a Choice Band, Terrakion is capable of being a potent wallbreaker against balance types such as Normal and Steel and is also able to revenge kill priority users such as Azumarill and Breloom with Quick Attack. Unfortunately, Terrakion's typing is awful defensively, leaving it vulnerable to common attacking types like Water, Ground, Fighting, and Psychic. This also means that it's highly susceptible to common priority attacks like Aqua Jet and Bullet Punch. Furthermore, Terrakion's mediocre bulk prevents it from surviving many hits from most powerful attackers, and despite its great Speed stat, it's still vulnerable to common revenge killers like Excadrill in sand if Sticky Web isn't up and Choice Scarf Latios.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Rock Slide can be used over Earthquake as a more consistent STAB option, but it's a weaker move, misses crucial KOs on Pokemon like Zapdos, and limits Terrakion's overall coverage. Terrakion can also use a Choice Band set to become a wallbreaker capable of 2HKOing Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Toxapex. This set, however, allows Terrakion to be outsped by Pokemon without a Choice Scarf, such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gallade.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Swords Dance can be used alongside Rockium Z in order to break past defensive checks like Slowbro and Gliscor. However, it doesn't provide the immediate wallbreaking power offered by Choice Band. Poison Jab can be used on Choice Band sets in order to KO Azumarill before it gets the chance to set up with Belly Drum. However, Quick Attack is more valuable for revenge killing it after it has set up. Substitute can be used alongside Swords Dance to generate some momentum from a forced switch, as well as being able to set up safely in front of passive Pokemon like Mega Sableye. It can also prevent Ditto from Transforming into Terrakion. However, this would come at the cost of helpful coverage in Earthquake. Rock Polish is an option with Swords Dance in order for it to act as a late-game sweeper. However, similarly to Substitute, it would mean foregoing important coverage.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Slowbro, Skarmory, and Clefable take all of Terrakion's attacks and can wear it down with their STAB attacks or recover any lost health with recovery moves. However, the Swords Dance set can break such defensive Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fairy- and Psychic-types: Pokemon such as Mimikyu and Choice Scarf Latios can easily revenge kill Terrakion with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Gliscor can take hits from Terrakion, as they resist Stone Edge. This, along with their bulk and access to Earthquake, allows them effectively check Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Bulky Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex both easily wall Terrakion due to their resistance to Close Combat, allowing them to recover lost health and wear it down with super effective moves in Giga Drain and Scald, respectively. Mega Venusaur and Toxapex need to watch out for the Swords Dance set, though.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Due to its Rock typing, Pokemon such as Azumarill, Breloom, and Mega Scizor threaten Terrakion with their respective priority moves in Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Even with a Choice Scarf, Terrakion is still outsped by faster Choice Scarf users such as Latios and Greninja and is KOed by their super effective moves. However, this is not the case if Terrakion manages to set up a Rock Polish.</p> <p><strong>Status: Pokemon such as Klefki and Mega Sableye can hit Terrakion with status moves that hinder Terrakion's ability to sweep and revenge kill, as paralysis slows Terrakion down, while burn halves its power.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Mega Swampert and Mega Slowbro can survive a hit from Terrakion and proceed to threaten it back with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Landorus, Garchomp, and Dugtrio can either outspeed and OHKO Terrakion or survive a hit from it and proceed to OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur is able to easily survive any of Terrakion's attacks and wear it down with Giga Drain while simultaneously sustaining itself with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Keldeo, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole are capable of KOing Terrakion with their STAB moves. Buzzwole in particular can consistently come in on Terrakion's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types like Latios, Mega Gallade, and Alakazam can survive a single hit and can proceed to OHKO with their STAB moves. Mega Gallade in particular resists both of Terrakion's STAB moves and can directly switch into them with passable health remaining.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf users such as Latios and Landorus-T can outspeed and take out Terrakion with their respective STAB moves. While Landorus-T is outsped by Choice Scarf sets, it can easily survive a Stone Edge thanks to Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Tapu Bulu are capable of KOing Terrakion depending on which coverage move it's running. This is important because Mega Diancie can take a Poison Jab while Tapu Bulu can take an Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Terrakion is weak to various priority attacks such as Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet from Pokemon such as Breloom, Azumarill, and Mega Scizor respectively.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Terrakion is severely hindered by all forms of status, with burn halving its Attack, paralysis halving its Speed, and poison quickly wearing it down each turn.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge allows Terrakion to hit important threats to Fighting like Mega Pinsir, Volcarona, and Victini as well as hit Flying-types that threaten the rest of the team, such as Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos. Close Combat is Terrakion's most consistent and powerful STAB move and allows it to threaten Normal- and Steel-types like Chansey and Heatran. Earthquake and Iron Head serve as useful coverage moves for KOing Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Choice Specs Gengar after Stealth Rock damage and OHKOing Mega Diancie, respectively. Poison Jab can be used instead to OHKO Tapu Bulu and hit other Fairy-types that are otherwise hit neutrally by Iron Head such as Azumarill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf allows Terrakion to outspeed a majority of the metagame, including fast threats like Life Orb Latios, Choice Scarf Victini, and +1 Mega Sharpedo. Maximum Attack investment allows Terrakion to hit as hard as possible. Justified is Terrakion's default ability and can be useful for punishing bulky Knock Off users such as Armaldo.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Terrakion is used best as a revenge killer, so sending it in after a teammate has been KOed allows it to effectively make use of its power and Speed to KO the opposing threat. Refrain from staying in on walls like Toxapex, Mega Sableye, and Slowbro, as they can compromise Terrakion's Speed with paralysis and hurt its power with burn, causing Terrakion to be less useful throughout the match. Terrakion should also not stay in against faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Latios and priority revenge killers like Azumarill and Scizor — especially after using Close Combat. Terrakion can also sweep teams late-game after all of the opposing team's walls have been taken down. In certain matchups, such as Bug, Terrakion should be preserved, as its typing allows it to check certain threats to the team, most notably Mega Pinsir. Avoid getting Choice-locked into unfavorable moves against certain Pokemon, as bulky setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Mega Altaria will take advantage of this and set up on Terrakion. Terrakion can be switched into weakened or passive Pokemon like Armaldo, as its bulk allows it to take some damage and return it with its powerful moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cobalion can provide Terrakion with Stealth Rock support, allowing it to get KOs on Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Dragonite after chip damage. Cobalion can also slow down some fast threats like Choice Scarf Greninja with Thunder Wave and pivot with Volt Switch. Keldeo threatens Ground-types like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Gliscor with its STAB Hydro Pump and coverage move Icy Wind. This helps Terrakion immensely, as these Pokemon can effectively check it due to their typing and bulk. Keldeo is also a powerful wallbreaker capable of breaking through physical walls such as Mega Sableye and Skarmory that otherwise check Terrakion. Breloom can put foes to sleep using Spore and also take down bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon and Swampert with its Technician-boosted STAB Bullet Seed, allowing Terrakion to sweep more effectively. Hawlucha provides great support to Terrakion with Defog, clearing Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes from the field while also taking care of opposing Grass-types like Mega Venusaur that otherwise completely wall Terrakion. It can also act as a secondary cleaner to take care of certain matchups that Terrakion falters in like Grass and Water. Both Buzzwole and Heracross are great Choice Scarf users that complement Terrakion, as they eliminate Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew. Additionally, Heracross can use Pursuit to trap threats like Choice Scarf Latios locked into Defog, and Buzzwole can use Ice Punch to hit Landorus-T and Gliscor. Mega Gallade helps break past physical tanks such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur thanks to its monstrous Attack stat paired with Swords Dance and powerful STAB moves. Terrakion in return can get rid of Mega Gallade's checks like Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu with its superior Speed and movepool. Kommo-o works great with Terrakion, as it's a great special sweeper that can threaten opposing defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur with its powerful Clangorous Soulblaze and help weaken opposing Steel- and Fairy-types that threaten Terrakion like Skarmory and Azumarill with its coverage options in Flamethrower and Poison Jab.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance (Fighting)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Terrakion's already impressive Attack stat to frightening levels, allowing it to wallbreak easily after a boost. Stone Edge is Terrakion's STAB attack and hits Flying- and Bug-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Pinsir, and it can be used in conjunction with Rockium Z to break past Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Slowbro after a Swords Dance boost. Close Combat is Terrakion's other reliable STAB move and has great coverage with Stone Edge, hitting Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Celesteela, Swampert, Garchomp, and Hippowdon hard. Rock Polish allows Terrakion to boost its Speed, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Latios, Tapu Koko, and Modest Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain. Substitute can be used over Rock Polish to safeguard Terrakion against status moves from Pokemon like Mega Sableye and to take advantage of the switches Terrakion forces. Additionally, it provides Terrakion with a safety net against revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Latios and Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment makes Terrakion hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Terrakion to outspeed threats like Mega Pinsir and Speed tie with other base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Cobalion and Keldeo. Rockium Z lets Terrakion utilize a 180-Base Power Continental Crush, allowing it to get past checks such as Toxapex and Slowbro.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against bulky types like Poison, Flying, and Water, Terrakion should set up Swords Dance in order to break their defensive cores. Against an offensive type like Electric, Terrakion should prioritize setting up Rock Polish in order to clean weakened teams late-game. As Continental Crush is a one-time attack, it should be used cautiously against walls and should not be wasted, as otherwise Terrakion will be unable to get past walls such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur. It should also be used cautiously against Protect and Baneful Bunker users such as Celesteela and Toxapex, as protection moves vastly decrease its damage output. Status conditions such as Scald burns and paralysis from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Zapdos should be avoided at all costs, as they severely hamper Terrakion's ability to wallbreak or clean late-game. If Substitute is used, it should be utilized against Pokemon like Mega Sableye that rely on status moves to check offensive foes. Due to Terrakion's average bulk and poor defensive typing, it should be brought in via safe switches after a teammate has fainted or smart double switches in the battle. Its average bulk allows it to live some strong attacks such as a Magnet-boosted Thunderbolt from Tapu Koko, however, and hence it should avoid taking unnecessary chip damage which may prevent it from setting up successfully. Entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web should be kept away, as Toxic Spikes puts Terrakion on a timer, limiting its potential to sweep with Rock Polish, and Sticky Web makes Terrakion more prone to being revenge killed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cobalion provides essential utility support in the form of Stealth Rock to score easier KOs and Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats such as Latios for Terrakion. Cobalion can also use Taunt to deny entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web. It has a neutrality to Fairy-type attacks, allowing Cobalion to beat threats like Mega Diancie for Terrakion. Hawlucha can provide Defog support so that Terrakion is not hindered by hazards such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes against Bug-, Poison-, and Water-type teams. In return, Terrakion weakens walls for Hawlucha to have an easier time cleaning late-game. Keldeo and Terrakion form a very good wallbreaking core. Keldeo can beat Mega Sableye and Hippowdon, and Terrakion can take advantage of walls weakened by Keldeo to clean teams by using Rock Polish. Lucario can help check Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Diancie with its Steel-type STAB moves and revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja and Latios with Extreme Speed. Choice Scarf Heracross and Buzzwole can help deal with Psychic-types like non-Choice Scarf Latios. Heracross can also beat defensive Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mega Slowbro thanks to its ability Guts, while Buzzwole with Ice Punch improves the Dragon-type matchup for Terrakion. Breloom helps in checking bulky Ground- and Water-type Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert. Its Spore also allows for setup opportunities for Terrakion. Mega Gallade helps weaken defensive cores and takes out Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur thanks to its STAB Zen Headbutt, relieving pressure off from Terrakion and allowing it to clean late-game with a Rock Polish boost. Mega Gallade is also able to deal with Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Latios with Knock Off or Shadow Sneak.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Terrakion's most powerful Rock-type STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Flying-types like Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y. Close Combat is Terrakion’s most consistent Fighting-type STAB move, letting it beat Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn as well as Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo. Earthquake provides solid coverage used to hit Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu. Poison Jab is used to hit Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Azumarill. Iron Head is another option that can be used in order to OHKO Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is used to make Terrakion as fast and strong as possible. A Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed and revenge kill threats such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. A Jolly nature allows Terrakion to outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Charizard X after a Speed boost as well as opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon like Nihilego and Tapu Bulu. Justified is Terrakion’s only ability, increasing its Attack stat whenever it's hit by a Dark-type move, allowing it to always KO Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Seismitoad with Close Combat after it switches into their Knock Off.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since Terrakion’s bulk isn’t very great, it's a good idea to bring it in as a revenge killer after a teammate has gone down. Terrakion can also serve as a powerful sweeper with its strong STAB combination in Stone Edge and Close Combat. It's also important to make careful predictions to bring Terrakion in safely, especially in matchups such as Dragon and Dark, where Terrakion can serve as an effective revenge killer and late-game sweeper. In some cases, Terrakion can be sent in on a weak Dark-type attack such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse in order to get an Attack boost from Justified, giving it much more wallbreaking power. However, if you still need to preserve its Choice Scarf to remove an important threat, don't let it take a Knock Off. Sometimes Terrakion can bluff a coverage option in order to force out threats like Mega Diancie and Tapu Bulu. Keep it away from status as much as possible, especially paralysis and burn, since they can diminish its effectiveness as a sweeper. In some situations, you shouldn't keep Terrakion in after sustaining multiple defensive drops from Close Combat, as they will leave it susceptible to priority attacks like Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Close Combat may do more damage than Stone Edge in some instances, but the defense drops can make it a subpar form of attacking.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie can bounce back status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp for Terrakion while also checking Fighting-types like Keldeo and Buzzwole. It can also bounce back Sticky Web, which is especially important considering that Rock doesn't have a reliable entry hazard remover. In return, Terrakion is able to beat Choice Scarf Pokemon like Magnezone and Tapu Bulu. Shuckle can set up Sticky Web for Terrakion, allowing it to outspeed faster Choice Scarf Pokemon like Gengar and Greninja as well as Sand Rush Excadrill. It can also use Encore to lock the foe into a harmless move in order to let Terrakion in safely. Tyranitar can trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Gengar with Pursuit and break past walls such as Toxapex and Celesteela. In return, Terrakion can check Steel-types like Excadrill and Bisharp. Nihilego is another great special wallbreaker that can beat Water-types like Swampert and Toxapex with Grass Knot and Thunderbolt as well as Ground-types like Landorus and Hippowdon with Hidden Power Ice and Grass Knot. It can also remove Toxic Spikes upon switching in, which is nice for keeping Terrakion healthy. Cradily can come in on Water-type attacks for Terrakion as well as beat Ground-types like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Seismitoad. In return, Terrakion can beat Ice-types like Mamoswine and Kyurem-B. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem can check Mega Scizor for Terrakion. Rhyperior also functions as an effective physical blanket check against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Sand Rush Excadrill, and Alolan Golem can trap and remove Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela. Omastar can check problematic Ground-types like Hippowdon with its STAB Hydro Pump. It also appreciates Terrakion being able to check Choice Scarf users like Kyurem-B and Hydreigon that outspeed it after a Shell Smash. Mega Aerodactyl offers a Ground immunity as well as a check to Fighting-types that Terrakion is unable to KO such as Keldeo and Mega Gallade. Stakataka can switch into and threaten Psychic- and Fairy-types like Latios and Clefable that would KO Terrakion and can also break past defensive checks like Mega Sableye and Celesteela with a Continental Crush.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band (Rock)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge lets Terrakion KO Flying-types like Mantine, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y. Close Combat is an important STAB move in order to beat Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Air Balloon Heatran. Earthquake is great coverage to hit Poison-types like Nidoking and Toxapex that Terrakion otherwise wouldn't be able to severely damage. Quick Attack is nice for revenge killing priority users like Breloom after prior damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is used to make Terrakion as fast and as strong as possible. A Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Charizard Y. With the Choice Band, Terrakion is capable of 2HKOing Pokemon that it wouldn't be able to otherwise, such as Skarmory and Landorus-T. Justified is its only ability, increasing its Attack whenever it's hit by a Dark-type move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is rather reliant on support from Shuckle's Sticky Web as a means of outspeeding Choice Scarf users like Excadrill and opposing Terrakion. Due to Terrakion's average bulk, it's a good idea to bring it in after a teammate has fainted. Try bluffing Choice Scarf against threats like Mega Diancie and +1 Mega Charizard X in order to force them out. In matchups like Steel, it is important to make smart predictions with Terrakion in order to consistently gain momentum. For example, you may need to predict a Mega Scizor to switch out against a check like Rhyperior to safely bring in Terrakion to threaten whatever switches in. Avoid status as much as possible, especially burn and paralysis, since they can halve Terrakion's Attack and Speed. Likewise, make sure to keep it away from attacking moves that cause these status conditions, like Scald and Discharge. Try weakening priority users like Azumarill and Breloom before revenge killing them with Terrakion's Quick Attack. Don't be afraid of spamming Terrakion's powerful STAB attacks against certain defensive cores on types like Normal and Steel.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle can set up Sticky Web to let Terrakion outspeed threats such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Excadrill. It can also use Encore on more passive Pokemon to allow Terrakion to safely switch in. Mega Diancie can bounce back status moves for Terrakion while also being able to check physically defensive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Mega Slowbro. It can also bounce back troublesome entry hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. In return, Terrakion is able to break through Chansey and Porygon2. Tyranitar can switch into and beat Psychic-types like Latios and Mega Latias for Terrakion. Nihilego can check Fairy- and Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Celebi with Sludge Wave, as well as Water-types like Slowbro and Mega Swampert with Thunderbolt and Grass Knot. In return, Terrakion can beat Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn that Nihilego can't beat. Cradily can switch into Water-type attacks for Terrakion thanks to Storm Drain while also being able to switch into Ground-type attacks from Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem are both capable of checking Mega Scizor for Terrakion. Rhyperior can also serve as a blanket check for faster threats like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill in sand, and Alolan Golem can trap and weaken Steel-types that can survive a Close Combat like Skarmory and Celesteela. Mega Aerodactyl provides a Ground immunity for Terrakion and a check to Fighting-types that Terrakion can't outspeed such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade. After setting up a Shell Smash, Omastar is able to beat threats that Terrakion is unable to beat without a Choice Scarf, such as Excadrill in sand under Sticky Web.</p> "

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus-T serves as a solid offensive pivot for Flying teams thanks to its good Speed and access to a threatening nuke with Supersonic Skystrike, which gives it many opportunities to use Defog on forced switches. Additionally, Tornadus-T's solid natural bulk combined with Regenerator lets it easily U-turn on forced switches to heal off weak attacks and chip damage from the likes of Scald and Stealth Rock. It has a great utility movepool, including U-turn to gain momentum for the team, and Knock Off, which lets it still be an annoyance to walls that don't care about Hurricane, such as Chansey and Celesteela. Tornadus-T is also very potent against passive balance archetypes like Water, which are unable to overwhelm it late-game due to its ability to continuously heal upon switching out with Regenerator. Flying teams have few or no Pokemon to wield Flying-type STAB moves offensively, giving Tornadus-T a valuable niche despite its pure Flying typing. However, Tornadus-T's typing offers no real defensive utility for Flying, stacking Ice, Rock, and Electric weaknesses that can be exploited by threats such as Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie, which Flying teams already struggle with. Tornadus-T is also reliant on Flyinium Z to threaten many Pokemon, as once it has used Supersonic Skystrike, its average Special Attack and inaccurate Hurricane make it much less of a consistent offensive threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is an option to make Tornadus-T even more efficient at keeping entry hazards at bay, but Tornadus-T is outclassed as a stallbreaker by Gliscor due to the lack of immediate recovery, and Taunt is sometimes hard to fit on a set. An expansive utility and offensive movepool means an Assault Vest set is possible, but Tornadus-T has to give up Defog for this set, which Flying teams greatly appreciate.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Rotom-W and Zapdos resist Hurricane and threaten Tornadus-T and the rest of the team with their STAB attacks, although those without recovery such as Zeraora are prone to getting worn down, invalidating them as switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl and Alolan Golem can switch into most of Tornadus-T's attacks, force it out with their STAB moves, and even set entry hazards if they carry them. However, most Rock-types lack recovery, leaving them susceptible to being chipped and too weak to switch into a Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Bisharp and Z-Happy Hour Jirachi can use Tornadus-T as setup fodder if it has been scouted to not be carrying Superpower or Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls like Zapdos and Mantine typically can shrug off any of Tornadus-T's moves, though some like Celesteela and Chansey hate losing their items.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Although Tornadus-T doesn't care much about burn or poison thanks to Regenerator, paralysis severely cripples it from effectively Defogging and pivoting by decreasing its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Durable Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Hazard setters with reliable recovery like Clefable and Cradily can outlast Tornadus-T if its Z-Move has been used, though confusion from Hurricane can potentially cause issues for them if they fail to use a healing move when it is needed for them to avoid being KOed.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hurricane is Tornadus-T's strongest STAB move, dealing respectable damage to walls like Swampert and Clefable, especially when paired with a 185-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike. U-turn lets Tornadus-T punish switches and gain Regenerator recovery, letting it act as an effective fast offensive pivot. Knock Off gives it valuable utility by removing key items of usual defensive switch-ins such as Porygon2's Eviolite and Celesteela's Leftovers. Knock Off can also remove items like Diggersby's Choice Band and Kyurem-B's Life Orb so a defensive teammate can check them more easily, as well as deal good damage to Psychic-types. Defog lets it take advantage of switches it forces to prevent Flying teams from being rapidly worn down by Stealth Rock. However, if another teammate such as Gliscor or Landorus-T carries Knock Off, coverage moves can be used to surprise usual switch-ins, such as Heat Wave for Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Scizor, and Superpower for Tyranitar and Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Flyinium Z gives Tornadus-T access to a 100% perfectly accurate STAB Supersonic Skystrike when it is needed to seriously damage a threat to the team, KOing the likes of Victini or Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Special Attack EVs let Tornadus-T hit as hard as possible with Supersonic Skystrike. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature make Tornadus-T as fast as possible, giving it many opportunities to Defog or gain momentum with U-turn. Timid is preferred over Naive, since Knock Off and U-turn are used for utility more than damage. However, Naive should be run if Superpower is used. Regenerator lets Tornadus-T heal off excess damage by simply switching out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tornadus-T is best used to switch into weak or resisted attacks from Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Hawlucha so it can stay as healthy as possible throughout the match thanks to Regenerator. Defog can be used to remove Stealth Rock when Tornadus-T isn't offensively pressured, but it should prioritize KOing slower wallbreakers that threaten it like Nidoking and Hydreigon if they are on the field. Use Knock Off to safely remove items whenever possible, such as removing Gastrodon's Leftovers to break through it more easily and Keldeo's Choice Specs to wall it more reliably. It is best to avoid unnecessary residual damage from walls it can't break, such as Mantine, so it can stay as healthy as possible throughout the match with Regenerator. U-turn can be used very liberally to gain momentum off of switches, since Flying has an excellent defensive and offensive core to fall back on. Take advantage of Regenerator by switching Tornadus-T in to scout what sets weak defensive Pokemon are running, such as seeing if a Swampert is carrying Toxic. It can also be worth aggressively switching Tornadus-T into passive Stealth Rock users like Celebi, since Tornadus-T can put itself in an advantageous situation by either removing entry hazards or gaining Regenerator recovery. Be careful when using Tornadus-T's Z-Move, as your opponent may try to bring in something that resists it or shrugs it off with ease. If possible, save it until it is absolutely needed to remove a threat or the opponent has nothing to comfortably switch into it. Tornadus-T can serve as a good Will-O-Wisp switch-in, since it doesn't care about the minor residual damage nearly as much as other teammates such as Zapdos or Celesteela. However, it should avoid paralysis at all costs, since the lowered Speed makes it far less effective at pivoting.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tornadus-T provides great utility with U-turn, Knock Off, and Defog, combined with solid offensive presence with Flyinium Z, making it a solid choice for many Flying teams. Zapdos can deal with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Mantine, alleviating pressure from Tornadus-T, as well as act as a switch-in for Electric-types like Zap Plate Tapu Koko. Zapdos also is able to run other sets such as Substitute + Toxic due to Tornadus-T taking the role of a Defogger. Gliscor serves as an effective stallbreaker using Taunt that can take on many defensive threats Tornadus-T can't easily muscle past, such as Chansey and Ferrothorn, and it can switch into and offensively threaten Electric types like Magnezone and Alolan Raichu. Gliscor can also form a U-turn core with Tornadus-T to constantly pressure the opponent as they switch, as well as Defog to make both itself and Tornadus-T very hard to wear down when paired with their strong defensive abilities in Poison Heal and Regenerator. Mantine serves as a great blanket check to special attackers and switch-in to Ice- and Water-type attacks from threats such as Greninja and Keldeo and as a strong defensive Defogger, forming a strong entry hazard removal core with Tornadus-T. Mantine also can use Haze against priority users like Mega Scizor and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill that blow past Tornadus-T after boosts. Skarmory and Celesteela can take on Rock-types like Mega Diancie that easily switch into Tornadus-T. Skarmory can also chip threats like Alolan Muk with Stealth Rock that try to switch into Tornadus-T, whereas Celesteela can situationally provide it with extra recovery with Leech Seed. Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Landorus-T are good offensive partners for Tornadus-T, since they appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to deal with Mega Venusaur and weaken teams so they can clean late-game. Tornadus-T synergizes even better with them if it runs Heat Wave, letting it break many defensive Steel-types like Skarmory that the former two struggle with. Landorus-T and Mega Aerodactyl can both deal with Heatran for Tornadus-T, which otherwise easily switches into most of its sets. Landorus-T can form a U-turn core with Tornadus-T, while Mega Aerodactyl can trap threats like Victini with Pursuit. Thundurus-T serves as an offensive pivot for Electric-types with Choice Scarf and can threaten teams more effectively thanks to Tornadus-T's ability to deal with Mega Venusaur. Dragonite appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to preserve its Multiscale with Defog. In exchange, it can use Dragon Dance or Choice Band to deal with defensive threats like Mantine and Tyranitar, which can otherwise wall Tornadus-T, as well as pick off fast threats like Greninja with Extreme Speed.</p> "

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>With 115 / 125 offenses, Thundurus can perform the role of a mixed attacker for Electric-type teams. A vast movepool helps it also check various threats to Electric such as Mega Venusaur and Normal, and it provides an important Ground immunity. Its Defiant can punish common moves like Defog, and a very good Speed at base 111 allows it to outspeed common base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Mega Gallade, and Latios. However, Thundurus has mediocre bulk, which means it will be easily knocked out by strong neutral moves and cannot be switched into attacks liberally. Its Flying typing makes it weak to Stealth Rock, which further limits the number of times it can switch in to wallbreak and reduces its pivoting options with U-turn, as well as to common Ice- and Rock-type moves, which Electric-types have difficulty switching into aside from Rotom-W and Alolan Golem, respectively. Thundurus also suffers from a case of four-moveslot syndrome, as it cannot check all the threats it could and will always be walled by some threats depending on the moveset it is running. Thundurus is outclassed by Zeraora as a check to Normal-type teams, but Thundurus can handle Mega Venusaur and Poison-type teams, which Zeraora cannot do.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Thundurus's ability Prankster makes it a valuable addition to Flying teams because it can paralyze threats like Kyurem-B and Terrakion with priority Thunder Wave. Thundurus is Flying's best check to Water-types like Toxapex and Mantine that can tank Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam. Thundurus also has a high Special Attack stat alongside access to many coverage moves such as Grass Knot and Focus Blast, allowing it to threaten bulky Ground- and Rock-types. Furthermore, Thundurus has access to a great utility move in Knock Off, letting it cripple common switch-ins such as Chansey. Thundurus also sits at an amazing Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed threats like Latios and makes it an amazing revenge killer. However, it still gets outsped by common threats to Flying such as Tapu Koko and Greninja, which are also immune to Prankster Thunder Wave. Despite Thundurus being a great offensive threat, its bad defensive stats make it easy to revenge kill, especially through the use of priority moves. Thundurus doesn't appreciate entry hazards due to its lack of recovery, as they wear it down easily with the addition of Life Orb recoil.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>Thundurus can also use Hidden Power Ice over Fly to form pseudo-BoltBeam coverage and take on Ground-types such as Landorus, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Thundurus can also utilize Grass Knot to beat bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Swampert and Hippowdon for teammates such as Zeraora. Thundurus can utilize a Choice Band set to wallbreak better; however, it is heavily prediction-reliant and makes Thundurus unable to check some of the major threats to Electric-type teams such as Mega Venusaur. Regardless, if running a Choice Band set, Thundurus can utilize Wild Charge over Thunderbolt. A set that uses Prankster instead of Defiant with Thunder Wave or Taunt is also viable, as it allows Thundurus to cripple faster threats or stallbreak. Thundurus can also utilize a Bulk Up set to boost its Attack and Defense stats. However, Thundurus has mediocre bulk, so it will find it hard to set up Bulk Up safely.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Nasty Plot can be used to take advantage of Prankster and make Thundurus a deadly setup sweeper, but Thundurus's bad bulk makes setting up Nasty Plot quite hard. Focus Blast can be used to hit certain walls, such as Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Heatran, harder. Focus Blast can also be used for Excadrill switch ins against Ground, as that is the main switch-in to Thundurus for Ground teams, and being able to eliminate Excadrill is very useful for offensive teams. Taunt is also an alternative that prevents walls like Chansey, Clefable, and Torkoal from setting up entry hazards. The addition of Taunt or Focus Blast, however, means losing Grass Knot, which prevents Thundurus from hitting Swampert, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon, or losing Hidden Power Ice, which means Thundurus cannot hit Pokemon like Garchomp, Landorus, and Dragonite.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Faster attackers: Faster attackers such as Choice Scarf Victini, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Nihilego can easily outspeed and KO Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Thundurus is walled by bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon, as it cannot fit moves to break past them and can get crippled with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp are not threatened by Thundurus and can KO it easily with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: While Mega Venusaur is checked by Fly, it can completely wall variants without Fly.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority users such as Choice Band Dragonite and Bisharp can check and do some serious damage to Thundurus with their priority moves. Thundurus is more susceptible to priority if it is running Life Orb due to the recoil.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Mixed walls such as Clefable, Mega Sableye, and Mew take on Thundurus pretty easily. Such Pokemon can simply recover off the damage from Thundurus and proceed to cripple it or use status moves such as Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Thundurus will lose 25% of its health to Stealth Rock due to its Flying typing, making it easier to check.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur doesn't care much about Thunder Wave because it is already a slow Pokemon, and Thundurus can barely touch it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey walls Thundurus in general. Thunder Wave doesn't hinder it thanks to Natural Cure, and Thunderbolt doesn't do much damage do it, but Chansey should be careful of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Cradily and Lanturn can easily switch into Thundurus, forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain can outspeed and easily OHKO Thundurus. Specially defensive Zapdos, meanwhile, can stall it out. Electric-types in general are immune to Thunder Wave and can normally switch into Thundurus relatively fearlessly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Faster Ground-types such as Choice Scarf or Sand Rush Excadrill, Dugtrio, and Choice Scarf Garchomp are immune to Thunder Wave, forcing you to sacrifice Thundurus or switch out. Slower Ground-types need to be careful of coverage moves but are still relatively safe switch-ins because they are immune to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Dark-types: Dark-types such as Greninja, Weavile, and Mega Houndoom are not affected by Prankster Thunder Wave, allowing them to outspeed and OHKO Thundurus. However, Dark-types generally can't switch into Thundurus's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Thundurus gets easily worn down by Life Orb recoil, Stealth Rock damage, and status ailments, making it easy to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Thundurus's lack of good defenses, it can be revenge killed by many faster threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Weavile, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Thundurus's primary STAB move and breaks through Flying-types such as Celesteela and Staraptor. Thunderbolt is also important for hitting physically bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro, which would shrug off Wild Charge, much harder. Knock Off is a good utility move that allows Thundurus to not only cripple Normal-type teams but also break Psychic-type teams better through severely damaging Pokemon such as Latios. Superpower allows Thundurus to beat threats to Electric-type teams such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Kyurem-B. Fly, when used with Flyinium Z, turns into a 175-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike that allows Thundurus to beat Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Celebi and Tapu Bulu on a predicted switch. It is also a powerful move in general, allowing Thundurus to break through neutral targets that can threaten Electric-type teams such as Nidoking. U-turn should only be used over Fly if a Z-Move is used on other Pokemon already. It allows Thundurus to act as a fast pivot and pressure Psychic-type teams in conjunction with Knock Off.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with a Naive nature makes Thundurus as strong and fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Latios and Mega Gallade. As the set shown is a mixed set, a Naive nature is used so that Thundurus can better take priority attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Dragonite. Flyinium Z as the item allows Thundurus to use a powerful move in Supersonic Skystrike to check Grass-types such as Breloom, Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu. If Fly is not used on the set, Thundurus can utilize Life Orb to increase the damage output of its moves. Defiant as the ability allows Thundurus to gain a free Attack boost if any of its stats is lowered from moves such as Defog. It is also useful against Intimidate users as Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus should be preserved in matchups where it is needed to eliminate threats such as against Poison- and Normal-type teams. Its main targets when against those teams are Mega Venusaur, Alolan Muk, and Chansey. Thundurus should not be switched into Stealth Rock often, as it severely limits the number of times it can come into the battle and wallbreak. Due to its low bulk, Thundurus should avoid switching into attacks directly, as it can get severely weakened, making it easy to KO and unable to wallbreak effectively. It should switched in through safe switches after a teammate has fainted, smart double switches, or slow Volt Switch support from Rotom-W and Zapdos. Thundurus has a vast movepool, so it is important to not reveal its coverage until the right moment in the battle. For instance, Thundurus can use Thunderbolt initially against Poison-type teams, giving the impression that the set is a special set and then take out Pokemon that may switch into Thunderbolt such as Nidoking, Alolan Muk, and Mega Venusaur by using Supersonic Skystrike. It should avoid status moves that cause burn and poison at all costs. Against walls that check Thundurus such as Zapdos, it should use U-turn on a predicted switch to such walls, gaining momentum for the team. As Supersonic Skystrike is a one-time move, it should not be used liberally against Poison- and Grass-type teams, as without it, Thundurus will not be able to break Pokemon such as Alolan Muk and Mega Venusaur. Knock Off should be used early-game to cripple walls such as Porygon2 and Swampert as well as punish offensive switch-ins like Latios. Superpower should be used cautiously, as its stat drops make Thundurus susceptible to priority moves such as Quick Attack from Diggersby and let Pokemon like Alolan Muk set up on it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W is a good teammate, as it can sponge special attacks aimed at Thundurus, cripple threats with Will-O-Wisp, and utilize a slow Volt Switch to bring in Thundurus freely. Rotom-W also deals with bulky Ground-types such as Landorus thanks to STAB Hydro Pump. Zapdos provides essential Defog support for Thundurus so that it can wallbreak without getting worn out fast from Stealth Rock. It also acts as physical wall to beat Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and provides Thundurus with Volt Switch support. Tapu Koko is a good wallbreaker that appreciates Thundurus checking some of its switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur and Alolan Muk. In return, Tapu Koko can deal with threatening Dragon-types with Dazzling Gleam. Alolan Golem provides Thundurus with important Stealth Rock support, which lets Thundurus KO more effectively. It can also trap Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill and eliminate or weaken them with Fire Punch or Earthquake. Alolan Raichu is another good teammate that can act as a cleaner once Thundurus weakens or removes its checks and counters. Zeraora is a fantastic physical attacker that appreciates Thundurus taking down shared checks and weakening walls such as Mega Venusaur and Swampert for it. Zeraora can also beat the Eviolite core of Normal-type teams, relieving pressure from Thundurus. Magnezone can trap and eliminate Pokemon like Mega Scizor, which can tank moves from Thundurus and pose a threat to it.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunder Wave, with the help of Prankster, cripples many threats such as Latios and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B. Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB move that gives Thundurus coverage against Water- and Flying-types. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit targets that Thunderbolt cannot hit such as Landorus and Gliscor. Grass Knot is a good coverage move that hits bulky Ground-types such as Seismitoad, Swampert, and Gastrodon. Knock Off is an alternative option that lets Thundurus surprise and cripple switch-ins like Chansey; however, using it means losing out on Grass Knot's useful coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Prankster gives Thunder Wave priority, which allows it to be used against faster Pokemon before they can hit Thundurus. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is used to let Thundurus outspeed many threats like Keldeo, Landorus, and Latios. 252 EVs in Special Attack along with Life Orb let Thundurus hit as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus can utilize Prankster Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats such as Choice Scarf Victini, Kyurem-B, and Terrakion. However, it doesn't have the best bulk and is thus not a reliable switch-in to many direct attacks and almost always goes down in exchange for crippling a foe with paralysis. Thundurus should be brought into play through pivoting moves from teammates such as Zapdos and Landorus-T. Thundurus can also switch into setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Salamence prior to their setup, allowing you to fire off a Thunder Wave and cripple them. It's worth it to sacrifice Thundurus to paralyze a big threat like Double Dance Mew or Terrakion. With its amazing Speed tier, Thundurus can revenge kill many Pokemon, such as Tapu Fini, Celesteela, and Mega Charizard Y. If Thundurus isn't needed to paralyze an opposing Pokemon, it should be kept healthy because it's a great late-game sweeper. It's very important to keep Stealth Rock off the field as much as possible to prevent Thundurus from taking entry hazard damage. Most specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Alolan Muk, and Mega Venusaur eat up anything Thundurus throws at them, but it's free to switch in on certain Water-type walls such as Toxapex and Mantine and immediately threaten them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock users such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, Aerodactyl, and Gliscor help wear opposing teams down and let Thundurus clean up more easily. Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mantine are essential for using Defog to clear Stealth Rock. Substitute + Toxic Zapdos in particular breaks Chansey and other bulkier Pokemon, and defensive Zapdos in general is a good switch-in to threats like Tapu Koko. Mantine and Skarmory provide a neutrality to Ice and form a good balanced core together, with Mantine being the special wall and Skarmory being the physical wall. Another great Pokemon neutral to Ice and Rock is Celesteela, which also helps with wearing down checks like Chansey with Leech Seed and Protect. Gliscor and Landorus-T are two good Electric-immune partners. Gliscor can stallbreak and absorb status ailments once Poison Heal activates, while Landorus-T can bring in Thundurus safely with U-turn and can set up Swords Dance without worrying about its low Speed thanks to Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, and Dragonite are great wallbreakers to soften up the opposing team, allowing Thundurus to clean up easily. Mega Aerodactyl is a decent partner, as it sits at an amazing Speed tier that allows it to clean up late-game and also appreciates Thundurus's reliability in taking out bulky Water- and Ground-types.</p> "

Volt Absorb allows it to switch on predicted Electric-type attacks, a trait appreciated by most Flying-types. Thundurus-T's bulk is decent for an offensive Pokemon, giving it ample opportunities to set up with Nasty Plot or Agility against defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. However, Thundurus-T is heavily reliant on its Z-Move to KO threats such as Zapdos and Porygon2, limiting its sweeping potential. Its lack of a reliable secondary STAB option means it heavily relies on boosted coverage moves to KO Electric-resistant threats. While it does have enough Speed to outspeed many threats, it falls short of the likes of Garchomp, Blacephalon, and Terrakion, all of which can revenge kill Thundurus-T easily if it lacks an Agility boost.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Thundurus-T's Special Attack to scary levels, allowing it to break many cores including the defensive core of opposing Flying teams. Agility allows Thundurus-T to fare much better against Pokemon on hyper offense teams, which could normally revenge kill Thundurus-T easily, such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, and Blacephalon. Thunderbolt is the main STAB option, allowing Thundurus-T to hit very hard after a boost. Electrium Z upgrades Thunderbolt to Gigavolt Havoc, which, at +2, can OHKO threats that Thunderbolt cannot. Hidden Power Ice creates pseudo-BoltBeam coverage with Thunderbolt, which provides Thundurus-T almost perfect coverage against Dragon-, Grass-, and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Breloom, and Gliscor. Alternatively, Focus Blast combined with Fightinium Z allows Thundurus-T to break through Rock-types like Tyranitar much more easily while also enabling it to break through Chansey and Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Thundurus-T to take full advantage of its Speed tier, outspeeding threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Jirachi. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to ensure that Thundurus-T hits as hard as possible. Electrium Z upgrades Thunderbolt into Gigavolt Havoc, providing Thundurus-T a powerful move to blow past threats that could otherwise take a +2 Thunderbolt and KO Thundurus-T back, such as specially defensive Heatran. Fightinium Z is used to unleash All-Out Pummeling, which is great for breaking through specially defensive Pokemon such Gastrodon and Chansey, both of which would otherwise wall Thundurus-T. Volt Absorb allows Thundurus-T to switch into predicted Electric-type attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thundurus-T is best used as a late-game sweeper because of its decent bulk and high Speed and Special Attack. Thundurus-T should set up on passive Pokemon or ones it can force out like Toxapex and Mega Scizor. It is very important to decide when to use Gigavolt Havoc or All-Out Pummeling, as it is necessary to blow past threats that could take +2 Thunderbolt or Focus Blast, such as Nihilego and Chansey. However, against certain matchups, Gigavolt Havoc or All-Out Pummeling may not be as important, so you can use it early-game to wallbreak. If running All-Out Pummeling, use it to lure and KO threats, especially Chansey. One Nasty Plot boost is usually sufficient enough to reach the point that foes will be KOed by the next attack. Setting up multiple Nasty Plot boosts may be tempting, but it is usually not required, and it leaves Thundurus-T open to status and chip damage, leaving it prone to Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Blacephalon. Although Thundurus-T has decent bulk, it is best to keep Stealth Rock off the field, as it needs to be at full health to effectively set up Nasty Plot or Agility. Switch Thundurus-T in on a predicted Volt Switch from the likes of Zapdos and Rotom-W to ensure that the opponent doesn't maintain momentum. Keep in mind that Thundurus-T will rarely have the opportunity to set up both Nasty Plot and Agility. Agility should be set up against offensive types such as Fighting, while Nasty Plot should be set up against more defensive archetypes such as as Normal. Do not reveal Nasty Plot or Agility early-game until it is absolutely necessary because it may allow Thundurus-T to bluff a Choice Scarf, giving it more opportunities to set up. Avoid status, most notably Toxic, as being badly poisoned puts Thundurus-T on a timer, which makes it more difficult to successfully set up due to the increasing damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All Flying-types appreciate Thundurus-T's ability to switch into predicted Electric-type attacks. Skarmory is a physical wall that can take most physical Rock- and Ice-type moves and remove entry hazards with Defog. On the other hand, Mantine is a special wall that can switch in on most special attackers and Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Walrein, with the added benefit of Defog to remove hazards as well. Celesteela is another good Pokemon that can switch in on Rock-types and Ice-types, being one of the few reliable Nihilego and Mega Diancie switch-ins for Flying. Its ability to whittle down threats with Leech Seed is very useful for a setup sweeper like Thundurus-T, as it allows Thundurus-T to play more conservatively with its Z-Move. Mega Aerodactyl helps Thundurus-T against offensive types and can even set up Stealth Rock or Pursuit trap some of Thundurus-T's counters such as Alolan Marowak and Choice Scarf Victini after it has used V-create. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can serve as a revenge killer, especially for Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie, two big threats for Flying teams. Dragonite is a strong physical wallbreaker that can severely weaken specially defensive walls that can stop Thundurus-T from sweeping. Thundurus-T in return can smash through the likes of physical walls such as Skarmory and Celesteela. Mega Charizard Y is an incredible wallbreaker that can assist Thundurus-T, as it can punch holes while notably being able threaten Ice- and Rock-types with Fire Blast and Solar Beam. Zapdos is a defensive wall that can assist Thundurus-T by removing Stealth Rock with Defog or checking Ferrothorn with Heat Wave, which walls the Electrium Z set. Landorus is also a good partner, being a secondary wallbreaker that can assist in denting answers like Alolan Marowak and Tapu Bulu with Earth Power and Sludge Wave. It can even use Knock Off to remove items from the likes of Porygon2 and Chansey, both of which can give Thundurus-T trouble.</p> "

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Landorus is a fantastic special wallbreaker for Flying teams, as the combination of Sheer Force, a Life Orb, and a wide movepool is extremely powerful and difficult to defensively counteract. Being a Ground-type is already desirable for Flying teams, as the Electric-type immunity is greatly appreciated against Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Zeraora. Its Speed tier also narrowly edges out potent threats such as Mega Charizard X, Kyurem-B, and Volcarona. Landorus has a decent amount of bulk for its offensive prowess, so it can take at least one hit, such as Celesteela's Heavy Slam or Mew's Psychic. However, Landorus is susceptible to Water- and Ice-type moves from foes such as Keldeo and Alolan Ninetales. Landorus faces competition from Landorus-T, as that forme better checks potent threats to Flying teams such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko when running a Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Landorus is the best special attacker Ground teams have to offer and one of the best special wallbreakers in the metagame. What makes it such an amazing wallbreaker is the combination of its good base 115 Special Attack, its Sheer Force ability, and the added power of Life Orb in addition to being able to freely change moves between each turns, in contrast to most other wallbreakers, which tend to use Choice items. Additionally, its Speed tier is just high enough to outspeed a multitude of Pokemon sitting at base 100 Speed and below, enabling it to outspeed dangerous threats like Mega Charizard Y and Hydreigon. Landorus's Earth Power is extremely powerful and, along with nice coverage in Sludge Wave and Focus Blast, Landorus can KO a great number of threats like Victini, Tapu Bulu, and Kyurem-B. In particular, the combination of Sludge Wave and Focus Blast nicely helps Landorus deal with Grass teams, which Ground teams usually struggle against. Landorus also has access to useful support moves in Gravity to pressure Flying teams and support its teammates, Knock Off to remove the items from foes, which helps to break past the Normal-type defensive core, and Rock Polish to become a late-game cleaner. As a wallbreaker, Landorus sports decent bulk that lets it survive powerful hits like Choice Specs Blacephalon's Shadow Ball and Mega Scizor's Swords Dance-boosted Bullet Punch. Unfortunately, even with its nice Speed tier, Landorus gets outsped and OHKOed by threats like Greninja, Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Also, Landorus's Ground / Flying typing exacerbates the Water- and Ice-type weaknesses commonly found on Ground teams, meaning fast users of such moves as well as Aqua Jet and Ice Shard users severely threaten Landorus and many of its teammates. Finally, even though Landorus is considered more viable than its Therian counterpart, using Landorus means you won't be able to add the reliable setup sweeper that is Landorus-T as a teammate.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used in Landorus's last moveslot as a better countermeasure to one of its best checks in Chansey, as it can remove its Eviolite and let Landorus damage it more effectively through its special attacks. However, teammates such as Tornadus-T and Gliscor can run Knock Off with better consistency. Calm Mind also can be used in place of Rock Slide, as it boosts Landorus's powerful Special Attack to greater heights. However, Landorus is already strong enough to break down nearly everything and in Monotype, so Calm Mind is a bit redundant. Rock Polish can also be used in the last slot with a Modest nature as a means of checking faster attackers in Greninja and Mega Lopunny, but then Landorus can no longer outspeed foes such as Kyurem-B and Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Calm Mind lets Landorus become a balance breaker, pressuring multiple defensive cores like the dual Eviolite core on Normal teams and the Mega Sableye + Mandibuzz core commonly found on Dark teams. However, Ground teams have their fair share of wallbreakers and strong sweepers to manage those kinds of cores and would rather have Landorus sport a support move like Gravity to help the entire team instead. Rock Slide, which is preferred over Stone Edge because of its comparable damage output due to Sheer Force and better accuracy, can be used to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and deal major damage to other Flying-types like Zapdos and Mantine, but it has little use in other matchups like Grass and Normal and much less overall utility than Gravity and even Knock Off. Focus Blast allows Landorus to threaten even more walls, such as Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, in addition to some airborne threats like Skarmory and Air Balloon Heatran outside of Gravity. Knock Off can be used instead of Rock Polish to remove items like Chansey's Eviolite, which enables Landorus to break the Normal-type defensive core for its teammates.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types like Alolan Ninetales and Mamoswine can easily OHKO Landorus with their STAB and priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Keldeo, Greninja, and Suicune can pressure Landorus with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster foes like Latios, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko can threaten to revenge kill Landorus. However, they must be wary of Landorus's powerful coverage options if they aren't able to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Specially defensive tanks such as Chansey, Mantine, and Celesteela can stomach most of Landorus's attacks and can recover their health from any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon: Foes with Levitate or Flying-types such as Mega Latias, Rotom-W, and Gliscor are immune to Landorus's Earth Power while also being able to stomach any other offensive option it can use.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Most Water-types, such as Greninja, Keldeo, and Gyarados, can OHKO Landorus and are either faster than it or bulky enough to tank one of its attacks. As a result, most of these Pokemon easily gain the upper hand against Landorus, forcing it out or simply KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon like Chansey, Mantine, and Araquanid all tank Landorus's attacks rather easily and can either heal off the damage or deal major damage to Landorus in return; however, they fear the occasional Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority Users: Though none of them can switch into Landorus, Ice Shard users, namely Mamoswine and Weavile, can use their strong priority moves to easily KO Landorus before it even moves. In addition, Azumarill can OHKO Landorus with Aqua Jet at +6.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf users like Tapu Bulu and Victini and naturally faster threats like Tapu Koko and Nihilego can all dispose of Landorus with their STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Airborne Pokemon: Without Gravity support, Landorus will have a lot of trouble dealing with Flying-types like Celesteela and Zapdos or healthy Levitate users like Rotom-W, while they can stall Landorus out or, in Rotom-W's case, OHKO it.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is Landorus's Ground-type STAB move, which reliably threatens Electric-, Steel-, and Poison-types such as Zeraora, Mega Scizor, and Toxapex. Sludge Wave is solid coverage against Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill. Focus Blast is useful against Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Porygon2. It can also hit Steel-types that are immune to Landorus's Earth Power, like Skarmory and Air Balloon Heatran. Landorus can run Stealth Rock to allow teammates such as Gliscor to run other options. Alternatively, Rock Slide helps against opposing Flying-types, which are immune to its Ground-type STAB move, such as Mantine and Zapdos. However, using Rock Slide over Stealth Rock isn't as ideal, since it's harder to fit on teammates such as Mega Aerodactyl and Skarmory, as they need that extra moveslot to fulfill their roles.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Landorus to be as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Kyurem-B and Mega Charizard Y. A Timid nature is utilized to boost its Speed to its peak without lowering one of its defensive stats. Alternatively, Landorus can use a Naive nature if it's using Rock Slide to boost its power. Landorus could use a Hasty nature to minimize damage taken from special attacks and, most notably, survive a Hidden Power Ice from Tapu Koko, though it no longer takes Choice Scarf Victini's V-create from full HP. Sheer Force and a Life Orb are powerful when used together, as Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil to amplify Landorus's damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus can be used as an early-game wallbreaker or sometimes as a lead, since its power and coverage options are very difficult to counteract defensively. Use teammates with pivoting options such as Volt Switch Zapdos and U-turn Tornadus-T to bring in Landorus safely, as this will keep up offensive pressure against the opponent. Take advantage of switches Landorus forces by setting up Stealth Rock against slower, weaker foes. Landorus can also act as a potent revenge killer against weakened foes and slower threats like Nidoking and non-Choice Scarf Victini. While Landorus has decent bulk, it should avoid taking unnecessary damage in order to wallbreak as much as possible. Setting Stealth Rock isn't always necessary, especially against foes such as Swampert and Mew that look to set up Stealth Rock of their own. Watch out for Ice-type coverage from foes such as Tapu Koko and Greninja, as they can OHKO Landorus. It's also ideal to avoid Knock Off users like Deoxys-S and Mega Sableye, as removing Landorus's Life Orb lessens its damage output. Landorus also provides an Electric immunity by virtue of its Ground typing, but it must be careful of coverage such as Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos is a solid switch-in to Water-types that threaten Landorus, such as Suicune and Gyarados. Its ability to utilize Defog, provide momentum through Volt Switch, and stall out bulkier foes such as Swampert through Substitute and Toxic can create better opportunities for Landorus to sweep teams. Mantine is a defensive pivot into Ice- and Water-type attacks for Landorus, as the former is a neutrality for Mantine while it completely walls the latter due to Water Absorb. It also has incredible special bulk that it can use to check special attackers such as Blacephalon and Greninja and can also use Defog to remove entry hazards for Flying teams. Mega Charizard Y can threaten Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Cloyster, as well as bulkier Water-types like Gastrodon and Slowbro through the combination of Drought and Solar Beam, for Landorus. In return, Landorus can switch into incoming Electric-type attacks for Mega Charizard Y. Mega Aerodactyl can check Ice-types such as Weavile and Alolan Ninetales for Landorus, and it's also able to Pursuit trap weakened foes such as Choice Scarf Victini and Latios that can threaten Landorus. Additionally, having Landorus take care of Stealth Rock allows Mega Aerodactyl to be an incredible asset against Dragon teams, as it would be able to use both Stone Edge and Pursuit to threaten the biggest threats to Flying teams such as Kyurem-B and Latios. Tornadus-T acts as utility for Landorus, as it removes Stealth Rock that can chip away at Landorus's health while also having access to Knock Off, which allows it to remove Chansey's Eviolite for Landorus. It's also a fast pivot that can consistently grasp momentum for Flying teams through U-turn and Regenerator. Celesteela is a general wall for Landorus, providing security against powerful priority users such as Mamoswine and Dragonite while also being able to use Leech Seed to help Landorus regain some of its HP if need be. Gliscor is another defensive pivot for Landorus, and it can also relieve some pressure off of Landorus from switching into Electric-type attacks thanks to its Ground typing and better recovery. Dragonite can break special walls, such as Chansey and Mantine, while Landorus can break down physical walls for Dragonite such as Toxapex and Avalugg. Skarmory assists Landorus by stacking entry hazards against foes without Ground-type immunities through Spikes and its own Stealth Rock, and it can also Defog away Stealth Rock that would chip away at Landorus and its teammates.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power, coupled with Sheer Force and Life Orb, is Landorus's strongest STAB move, enabling it to deal considerable damage to physical walls like Slowbro and Mega Venusaur. Sludge Wave is used as a way to hurt problematic Grass-types, OHKOing dangerous threats like Tapu Bulu and Breloom. Outside of Gravity, Sludge Wave also hits most Flying-types for neutral damage. Gravity greatly helps Landorus and its teammates against Flying and Steel teams, as it enables Landorus and the rest of the team to deal with troublesome threats found on these teams like Zapdos, Mega Charizard Y, and Celesteela that would be very problematic to deal with otherwise. Rock Polish, on the other hand, lets Landorus clean opposing teams late-game by almost outspeeding the entire metagame, including some threats like Modest Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Keldeo.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sheer Force boosts all of Landorus's STAB and coverage moves except Knock Off by a factor of 1.3, thus making it a terrific wallbreaker. Life Orb should be the only item used on Landorus, as it improves its damage output even further without having to suffer the recoil damage thanks to Sheer Force. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs coupled with a Timid nature are used so that Landorus can be as fast and strong as possible. If Landorus uses Knock Off in its fourth moveslot, the 4 Special Defense EVs should be moved to Attack and a Naive nature should be used instead to avoid lowering its Attack stat, enabling it to achieve certain KOs like an OHKO on Latios after Stealth Rock damage. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty so that Landorus can better tank priority moves coming from the likes of Azumarill and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a wallbreaker, Landorus is best used to punch holes early-game so it can pave the way for its teammates to eventually sweep or clean the opposing team. Even with its decent bulk, it's preferable to bring Landorus onto the field against weak attackers, such as Skarmory and opposing Hippowdon, or after a teammate has fainted, as it's still easily 2HKOed by a vast number of Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and opposing Excadrill. Because Landorus has such a fantastic damage output, it often forces opponents to switch in their specially defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey and Mantine. If Landorus cannot seriously harm them, it's often best to switch out to a physical wallbreaker like Excadrill or Mamoswine. If Landorus is running Knock Off, however, removing the special wall's item might be more profitable than switching out. Gravity is best used in matchups like Flying, Steel, and Electric where there are numerous airborne threats. More specifically, Landorus can set up Gravity when forcing a passive Pokemon like Skarmory to switch out or when it's being sacrificed against slower Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard Y and Rotom-W. In the instance that Landorus carries Rock Polish, the best course of action would be to not set up until late-game, when its checks, such as Keldeo and Latios, are weakened, and to safely do so against Pokemon that are more likely to switch out. Having many viable options for its last move as its disposal, Landorus can use that unpredictability to its advantage by concealing its last move, if possible, until an opportunity opens up. In the long run, the opponent will have to carefully play around it, whether it's to not lose any Ground-immune Pokemon, to preserve its special wall's item, or to avoid being swept clean late-game. However, for whatever move Landorus has in its final moveslot, it's important to try and keep Landorus away from status, as status will chip down its health rather quickly, especially if entry hazards are to be taken into account. Furthermore, opposing Knock Off users can remove Landorus's Life Orb and make it considerably less powerful, preventing it from achieving certain OHKOs, such as against Celesteela with Gravity support, and 2HKOs, such as against Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of Landorus's teammates really enjoy Gravity support, as it lets them freely spam their Ground-type STAB moves against Flying-types and other airborne threats. Seismitoad and Gastrodon are both great additions to any Ground team due to their Water immunities and Ice neutralities. Seismitoad can stop Belly Drum Azumarill's sweep with Sludge Wave and get rid of Chansey's Eviolite with Knock Off, while Gastrodon can repeatedly switch into Greninja's and Keldeo's moves due to its superior longevity. Dugtrio is a superb offensive teammate for Landorus, as after the latter has set up Gravity, Dugtrio can trap airborne threats like Mega Charizard Y and Celesteela that couldn't be trapped otherwise. Additionally, Dugtrio can trap and dispose of Chansey and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Bulu and Kyurem-B for Landorus. In return, Landorus can deal with physical walls like Skarmory and Slowbro. Sand Rush Excadrill can form a potent wallbreaking core with Landorus because they can blast through each other's checks. Furthermore, Excadrill can clean opposing teams after Landorus has punched holes in them, outspeeding and KOing most opposing threats, especially against Fairy and Ice teams. Hippowdon is a great switch-in to fast and strong physical attackers that would severely weaken or outright KO Landorus, such as Mega Gallade and Choice Scarf Victini. Hippowdon can also set Stealth Rock so that Landorus can OHKO threats like Focus Sash Breloom and offensive Mega Scizor. Swords Dance Garchomp is one of the few setup sweepers found on Ground teams and can take advantage of Landorus's early wallbreaking to inflict severe damage upon the opposing team. It can also dispose of numerous threats that Landorus has a hard time against, such as Chansey and Mantine, while Landorus takes out physical walls like Skarmory and Clefable for Garchomp. Mamoswine and Mega Garchomp can also wallbreak alongside Landorus and overwhelm troublesome Flying, Grass, and Normal teams. As a bonus, Mamoswine can switch into Ice-type moves aimed at Landorus, while Mega Garchomp, in addition to being neutral to Water-type moves that Landorus is weak to, is bulky enough to survive Tapu Bulu's Wood Hammer or Azumarill's +6 Aqua Jet before KOing them in return with Fire Blast and Earthquake, respectively.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Landorus-T has a wide array of options at its disposal, providing an absolutely stellar role compressor for Flying teams with its incredible offensive prowess, Stealth Rock, Double Dance, and other tools. Landorus-T is a fantastic revenge killer that threatens very potent enemies to Flying teams such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko. Its solid defensive typing, when coupled with above average bulk and Intimidate, can allow Landorus-T to act as a physically defensive pivot. Setup options in Swords Dance and Rock Polish can make Landorus-T a very deadly late-game sweeper. Its Electric immunity is always appreciated by Flying teams, especially against foes such as Tapu Koko and Magnezone that more often than not would lock themselves into Electric-type moves. Landorus-T's decent Speed tier lets it naturally outspeed threats such as Meloetta and Rotom-H, but it also leaves Landorus-T susceptible to faster threats such as Kyurem-B and Hidden Power Ice Nihilego. Furthermore, without a form of reliable recovery, Landorus-T must be played somewhat conservatively to avoid unnecessary damage. Landorus-T faces competition from its Incarnate forme, as the latter's better speed and power through Sheer Force and a Life Orb make it a better, more immediate wallbreaker for Flying teams.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Landorus-T finds itself on Ground teams as a fantastic revenge killer and excellent option to add to any team due to it being one of the few viable Choice Scarf Pokemon available to Ground teams. Landorus-T provides a fantastic way to keep faster foes in check outside of sand, which most Ground teams lack, able to take down threats such as Porygon-Z and Choice Specs Keldeo after prior chip outside of sand. Landorus-T also has access to fantastic setup moves that allow it to become a threatening setup sweeper, namely Rock Polish, which allows it to take on offensive teams very easily, and Swords Dance, which allows it to break through walls with more ease. Intimidate is a fantastic ability that allows it to check physical attackers by dropping their Attack by one stage, allowing it to take on threats such as Mega Lopunny. U-turn allows Landorus-T to capitalize on the switches it forces by bringing in a more favorable teammate, allowing it to pick up momentum for Ground teams. Additionally, it brings fantastic utility moves in Knock Off, which can cripple walls such as Suicune by removing Leftovers, and Defog, allowing it to clear hazards off the field. Unfortunately, Landorus-T stacks Ice- and Water-type weaknesses that Ground-type teams are naturally weak against, though its secondary Flying-type provides Ground with a neutrality to Grass-type coverage and an immunity to Ground-type attacks, and though it is a fantastic pivot, due to its lack of recovery, it needs to be brought into battle cautiously. Also, by using Landorus-T, Ground teams miss out on using Landorus, which is a staple to Ground teams by providing Gravity support and being able to form a nice wallbreaking core with Excadrill as a fantastic special attacker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p>Flyinium Z with Fly can also be used on the Double Dance set, as Landorus-T would use Supersonic Skystrike to hit physically defensive foes like Clefable, Porygon2, and Gliscor harder. As a standalone move, Fly naturally has more PP than Stone Edge and an increased chance of hitting the foe, but it also takes two turns to use. Additionally, Fly can be easily counteracted by using Protect or switching out into a physically defensive foe. Lastly, using Fly would make it impossible for Landorus-T to break Steel / Flying types, such as Skarmory and Celesteela. An Adamant nature on Rockium Z sets can be used over a Jolly nature, as it provides a slight increase in power in exchange for lower Speed. However, while slightly more powerful at base value, the drop in Speed makes Landorus-T vulnerable to Choice Scarf Greninja, even after a Rock Polish boost. Superpower can be substituted over Stealth Rock or Defog on Choice Scarf variants to assist in the Normal matchup and is mainly used in tandem with Knock Off to break the defensive core of Chansey and Porygon2. However, there are very few uses to Superpower outside of this purpose. A physically defensive variant of Landorus-T can be utilized due to its decent physical bulk and access to Intimidate, but without a form of reliable recovery, there are more ideal partners for fulfilling a role like this, namely Gliscor and Skarmory. Toxic can be utilized on Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T to break down some of its physically defensive switch-ins, such as Suicune and Gastrodon, effectively setting a timer on them. Be careful of using this option, though, as Poison-types, Steel-types, and Natural Cure users like Chansey and Celebi can ignore its use, halting your momentum and forcing a teammate to switch in directly.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p>Sludge Wave and a Naive nature can be run over Defog on the Choice Scarf set to allow Landorus-T to catch Tapu Bulu off guard and OHKO it. However, running Sludge Wave means losing out on running Defog, which makes the team weaker to entry hazards such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. Flyinium Z can be used with Fly instead of Stone Edge and Rockium Z to target and OHKO defensive threats like Buzzwole, which would otherwise wall it.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types such as Suicune, Gyarados, and Mantine can take any one of Landorus-T's hits and can cripple it with any Water-type move or a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B and Alolan Ninetales threaten to OHKO Landorus-T through their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Choice Scarf users in Greninja and Keldeo and other setup sweepers in Double Dance Mew and Kommonium Z Kommo-o greatly threaten Landorus-T through their powerful offensive options.</p> <p><strong>Status and Residual Damage: Status Conditions like burns and poison as well as consistent exposure to Stealth Rock greatly inhibit Landorus-T's ability to act as a revenge killer, as it has no reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive foes like Skarmory, Avalugg, Mega Venusaur, and Gastrodon have enough bulk to stall Landorus-T out of its moves and can reliably recover off any damage taken.</p> <h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-type Pokemon that are faster or can easily wall Landorus-T all threaten it by outright OHKOing it with powerful STAB attacks, such as Keldeo with Hydro Pump, or burning it through Scald, such as Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Alolan Ninetales can threaten to OHKO Landorus-T with their powerful STAB attacks. Pokemon such as Weavile and Mamoswine can also threaten to OHKO it with priority Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physical walls such as Porygon2 and Skarmory can easily wall Landorus-T due to their above average bulk and ability to shrug off damage with their recovery moves. However, after a Swords Dance boost, Landorus-T can 2HKO Porygon2 with its STAB Earthquake and can OHKO Skarmory after minor chip damage with Continental Crush.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Status conditions such as burn and Toxic poison severely limit Landorus-T's ability to sweep, as the former prevents it from effectively wallbreaking and the latter puts it on a timer, limiting the number of turns it has left on the battlefield.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Choice Scarf Greninja, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Latios can all threaten Landorus-T with their powerful STAB attacks. Strong priority attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Azumarill's Aqua Jet can threaten to severely dent it as well.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's STAB attack and breaks through foes like Terrakion, Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Koko. U-turn is a pivoting option that Landorus-T utilizes to keep momentum and also reliably damages Psychic- and Dark-types such as Celebi and Hydreigon. Knock Off removes the foe's held item, hampering their defenses or recovery, and it's especially helpful against Normal teams for removing Eviolite from Porygon2 and Chansey. It also hits Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latias and Gourgeist for super effective damage. Stealth Rock and Defog support are both solid roles that Landorus-T can compress in order to allow other teammates like Zapdos, Gliscor, and Skarmory to perform better and more effective roles for Flying teams. Stone Edge is an option to deal with opposing Flying-types such as Mantine and Mega Charizard Y. However, the move doesn't have much purpose outside of this, and the move itself tends to be walled by many of Landorus-T's most common switch-ins.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allow Landorus-T to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs, when paired with a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature, allow Landorus-T to outspeed offensive threats in Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Z-Conversion Porygon-Z. Intimidate is used to threaten physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set mainly works as a momentum shifter, as its use of U-turn, when paired with Volt Switch from Zapdos and U-turn from Tornadus-T, chips the opposing Pokemon frequently while also keeping offensive momentum. Choice Scarf Landorus-T also acts as a revenge killer, so bring it in on weakened foes. By doing so, you put yourself in a good position while ensuring that Landorus-T takes minimal damage. When used against foes threatened by its presence like Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko, Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock on their predicted switch to keep up residual damage or Defog to increase the longevity of Landorus-T and its teammates. Switch in on physical attackers such as Excadrill and Terrakion to lower their Attack with Intimidate, as lessening their damage output often forces a switch into a defensive option, which you then can take advantage of with U-turn to keep up momentum. Be careful of switching directly into Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Tapu Koko, as many of them carry Hidden Power Ice to deal with Landorus-T and other Ground-types. Choice Scarf Landorus-T also works as a reliable lead, as it can scout for the foe's options and can either pivot into an appropriate check with U-turn or set up Stealth Rock to get residual damage off early. Using Knock Off has little to no drawback in many matchups, since it greatly inhibits the foe's passive recovery, defenses, and roles. However, be wary of locking into it, as Landorus-T can be turned into setup bait for Mega Evolutions like Gyarados, Scizor, and Latias. Avoid status conditions, specifically burns and paralysis, as they greatly inhibit Landorus-T's ability to act as a revenge killer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mantine pairs very well with Landorus, as its typing and natural bulk provide defense against Ice- and Water-type moves. Its ability to remove Stealth Rock through Defog and its access to Roost grant extended periods of longevity for itself and its teammates. In return, Landorus acts as an offensive pivot into Electric-type attacks or foes such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Golem. Zapdos provides Landorus-T with some extra defensive utility, being neutral to Electric-type moves and being able to wear down bulkier foes such as Skarmory and Mantine. Its SubToxic set can stall out bulkier Water teams with foes such as Gastrodon and Suicune that would otherwise be pressuring for Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y is a very powerful wallbreaker that checks Water-types such as Mega Swampert and Rotom-W, as its access to Drought and Solar Beam lets it weaken and threaten them for Landorus-T. In return, Landorus-T comes in on Electric- and Rock-type moves threatening to OHKO Mega Charizard Y. Celesteela is a solid wall for Landorus-T, as its defensive typing, high mixed bulk, and access to Leech Seed allow it to reliably come in on Ice- and Rock-type attacks, while Landorus-T can pivot into Electric-type attacks freely and can preemptively stop Magnezone from trapping Celesteela. Skarmory provides Spikes support to cripple grounded foes throughout the course of the battle and can also come in on many physical attacks for Landorus-T. In return, Landorus-T can come in on Electric-type attacks for Skarmory. Tornadus-T is a fabulous mixed attacker for Flying teams, and, because of its very high Speed, it also acts as an offensive Defogger for Flying teams looking to remove Stealth Rock. Landorus-T can pivot into Electric- and Rock-type attacks for Tornadus-T, and pairing them both together creates an offensive VoltTurn core that keeps momentum constantly, especially with Tornadus-T's excellent ability in Regenerator. Gliscor is an incredibly potent stallbreaker when it's poisoned, as it not only receives passive recovery through Poison Heal but also acts as a status sponge for Landorus-T by absorbing Scald and Will-O-Wisp from weaker utility foes such as Toxapex and Mega Sableye. Dragonite is a powerful wallbreaker with its access to various offensive moves ranging from Earthquake to Outrage, Superpower, and even Extreme Speed to revenge kill weaker threats like Azumarill and Greninja for Landorus-T. In return, Landorus-T weakens physical attackers for Dragonite, such as Terrakion and Mega Sharpedo. Mega Aerodactyl pairs well with Landorus-T, since it acts as a very potent Pursuit trapper for foes that can pressure Landorus-T, such as Choice Scarf Latios and Choice Scarf Gengar.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's best STAB move and does massive damage to foes that don't resist it. Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types or foes that use Levitate, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mantine, and Rotom-H. Swords Dance and Rock Polish are both Landorus-T's setup options, sharply raising its Attack and Speed stats, respectively. At +2 Attack, Landorus-T has the capacity to threaten slower, bulkier builds; for example, it can almost always OHKO Celesteela with Continental Crush when it has that boost. Conversely, being at +2 Speed makes Landorus-T a potent sweeper against faster, more offensive teams and threats such as Choice Scarf Greninja and Double Dance Mew.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Landorus-T to hit as hard as possible when combined with Swords Dance. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Landorus-T to go as fast as possible, outpacing threats like Choice Scarf Latios, Choice Scarf Gengar, and Choice Scarf Greninja after a Rock Polish boost. Intimidate is its only ability, lowering the foe's Attack stat by one stage. Rockium Z is used in tandem with Stone Edge to deal heavy damage to Flying-type foes, such as Gliscor and Celesteela.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is designed to act as a late-game sweeper, so avoid bringing it in unnecessarily on Stealth Rock, priority attacks from foes like Mega Lopunny and Azumarill, and other sources of residual damage as much as possible. Bring Landorus-T in on physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir and Terrakion, as its Intimidate makes it easier to set up a Swords Dance or Rock Polish. Status conditions, specifically paralysis and burn, hinder Landorus-T's ability to act as a setup sweeper, so avoid moves that could inflict these conditions, such as Scald, Will-O-Wisp, and Glare. Rockium Z, being a one-time use move, should be well preserved to chunk physically defensive threats like Skarmory and Slowbro after a Swords Dance boost. In situations where Landorus-T's health is considerably low and beyond the point of saving, Continental Crush can be used as a last-ditch effort to heavily damage the foe at least to a point to where another Flying-type teammate, such as Dragonite or Mega Aerodactyl, can revenge kill them. Both Swords Dance and Rock Polish boost Landorus-T's stats, but they don't have to be used together. Rock Polish is better to use against offense-oriented teams like Electric and Psychic, as they often are frail and can be broken easily by Landorus-T's natural power. Swords Dance, on the other hand, works better against bulkier teams such as Steel and Dark, where the majority of foes are naturally slower than Landorus-T. Landorus-T can sometimes be used to bluff a Choice Scarf and can sometimes force switches this way by threatening to revenge kill a weakened threat. In situations like these, you can take the opportunity to set up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is a solid partner for Double Dance Landorus-T, with an amazing Speed tier that very few can match. It can also use its STAB Stone Edge against opposing Flying-types for Landorus while also being able to Pursuit trap weakened threats, such as Victini and Latios. In return, Landorus-T can switch into many Electric-type attacks for Mega Aerodactyl. Regular Aerodactyl is also a nice partner for Landorus-T, as its access to support moves such as Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Tailwind makes it a very good suicide lead. It even has the option of running Earthquake, as it Speed ties and threatens one of the greatest threats for Flying teams in Tapu Koko. Setting up Stealth Rock and Taunting potential Defoggers in Staraptor and Mandibuzz enable Landorus-T to set up and sweep much more effectively late-game. Mantine pairs very well with Landorus-T, as its typing and natural bulk provide defense against Ice- and Water-type moves. Its access to Roost and capability to remove Stealth Rock through Defog allow for extended periods of longevity for itself and its teammates. In return, Landorus acts as an offensive pivot into Electric-type attacks or foes such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Golem. Mega Charizard Y is a powerful special wallbreaker for Landorus-T, as it checks Ice-types like Mamoswine and Kyurem-B and also soft checks Water-types such as Mega Swampert and Rotom-W through its access to Drought and Solar Beam. In return, Landorus-T can come in on Electric- and Rock-type moves that threaten Mega Charizard Y. Celesteela is a solid wall, as its great defensive typing allows it to reliably come in on Ice- and Rock-type attacks for Landorus-T. In return, Landorus-T can switch into Electric-type attacks for Celesteela as long as it remains healthy. Skarmory provides hazard support in Spikes or Stealth Rock to cripple grounded foes for residual damage and can also come in on physical attackers such as Mamoswine and Weavile for Landorus-T. In return, Landorus-T can switch into Electric-type attacks for Skarmory if it's healthy enough. Gliscor is a physically defensive pivot that pairs well with Landorus-T, as its solid Defense and recovery options are very good. Given that Gliscor also receives passive recovery when paired with a Toxic Orb, it can function as a status sponge against Scald users such as Mantine and Suicune. In return, Landorus-T can deal with faster offensive threats like Kyurem-B and Mega Manectric after a Rock Polish boost, as Gliscor often tends to not have much Speed investment and is thus susceptible to these quicker attackers. Dragonite's natural power makes it a strong physical wallbreaker for Landorus-T, considering its options in Outrage, Superpower, and even Extreme Speed to revenge kill faster foes in Tapu Koko and Greninja. Landorus-T, in return, can use Intimidate to weaken physical attackers that threaten Dragonite, such as Terrakion and Mimikyu.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's strongest STAB attack, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Keldeo. Knock Off allows it to cripple Pokemon by removing their items, such as Chansey's and Porygon2's Eviolites, and can be spammed in the Psychic matchup. U-turn allows Landorus-T to safely bring in a teammate and pick up momentum while taking on Pokemon such as Celebi that can be a nuisance for Ground teams to deal with. Defog allows it to clear entry hazards from the field, freeing a slot for its teammate Excadrill. Stone Edge is an option over Defog to take on Pokemon such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y. Since using Stone Edge means it can no longer use Defog, however, the team becomes more vulnerable to hazards and can be broken more easily by wallbreakers such as Tapu Bulu. Toxic allows it to cripple switch-ins such as Porygon2 and Staraptor, which would otherwise easily wall it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to hit as hard and fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Mega Lopunny and Porygon-Z at +1. Intimidate allows Landorus-T to check physical attackers such as Victini and Mega Gallade.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T should take advantage of forced switches by using the turn to get off a free U-turn and bring in a teammate or clear entry hazards off the field with Defog. Since being locked into Defog can invite setup sweepers in, it is best to make sure the team can still check them before doing so. Intimidate allows Landorus-T switch into physical attackers it can easily take care of such as Choice Scarf Excadrill. However, if the opposing player has a switch-in to Landorus-T, it should click U-turn to pick up momentum. Knock Off should be used to cripple foes by removing their items, such as Porygon2's Eviolite, allowing Choice Band Excadrill to 2HKO it with Earthquake, or Suicune's Leftovers, preventing it from being able to spam Substitute. Landorus-T can also be used as a lead due to its natural Speed paired with Choice Scarf and U-turn, which can be used to scout the opponent's set and pivot into a better teammate. Landorus-T is a fantastic late-game revenge killer, being able to clean through weakened teams and take on threats such as Keldeo after minor chip damage. Landorus-T should pivot out against Pokemon it cannot take on with U-turn and bring in a better teammate. However, against Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja, Landorus-T should directly switch out to a Pokemon that can tank its Ice Beam such as Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All Ground teams appreciate Landorus-T's ability to clean late-game with its Choice Scarf, outspeed threats such as Mega Gallade, remove items such as Porygon2's Eviolite, and clear hazards with Defog such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. Hippowdon has access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock, both of which chip down potential checks to Landorus-T, giving it an easier time cleaning late-game, and appreciates Landorus-T's Intimidate, which only further bolsters its capabilities as a mixed wall. In return, Landorus-T appreciates Hippowdon's ability to take on physical attackers and wipe off the damage with Slack Off, taking the pressure off of Landorus-T to be the team's only switch-in to physical attackers. Excadrill forms a nice offensive core with Landorus-T, as they both share similar checks and can help each other chip them down. Excadrill can also take on annoying Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu that Landorus-T struggles to take down and appreciates Landorus-T's Defog, which allows it to run extra coverage such as X-Scissor or even Swords Dance over Rapid Spin. Seismitoad and Gastrodon provide the team with a Water-type immunity, being able to freely switch into Water-type attacks that threaten Landorus-T. Gastrodon is a more defensive option, being able to passively recover and chip foes with Toxic, that appreciates Landorus-T's ability to remove the items of other walls such as Mandibuzz with Knock Off, allowing Gastrodon to wear them down more easily. Seismitoad brings a more offensive presence, being able to beat Pokemon such as Azumarill. Garchomp can form a fantastic physical wallbreaking core with Landorus-T, as it can break walls such as Porygon2 with Swords Dance and Devastating Drake, allowing Landorus-T to sweep with more ease late-game. Landorus-T also appreciates Garchomp's ability to take on physically defensive Pokemon that it has trouble breaking past such as Ferrothorn with Fire Blast. Dugtrio's Arena Trap allows it to trap threats such as Tapu Bulu, which it can weaken with Sludge Wave, and pick off weakened threats such as Celebi with Sucker Punch. Nidoking is a great teammate that makes up for an absence of Landorus, being a strong special attacker that is also able to hit Ground-immune Pokemon such Levitate and Flying-type Pokemon for Landorus-T.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Landorus-T's main STAB attack and allows it to take on Pokemon such as Scizor, Excadrill, and Mega Altaria. Stone Edge allows it to take on Flying-types such as Skarmory and Celesteela that are immune to Earthquake. Swords Dance allows it to take on defensive threats such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn and helps it against bulkier teams. Rock Polish allows it to take on offensive threats and become a sweeper by outspeeding offensive threats such as Choice Scarf Greninja.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment paired with a Jolly nature allows Landorus-T to hit as fast and hard as possible, being able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame such as Choice Scarf Greninja after a single Rock Polish. Rockium Z allows Stone Edge to become Continental Crush, taking out Pokemon that would otherwise wall Landorus-T after a boost, such as Celesteela after Stealth Rock. Intimidate allows Landorus-T to take on Pokemon such as Scizor and Mega Lopunny as well as find more opportunities to set up against physical attackers such as Mimikyu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Landorus-T should set up to sweep once all its checks and counters such as Celesteela have been weakened to a point where it can sweep through the opposing team. It should set up Swords Dance against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Chansey. However, against more offensively oriented teams, Landorus-T should set up Rock Polish, since Pokemon are most likely unable to wall it even without a Swords Dance boost. It should avoid status conditions at all times, as burns prevent it from being an effective cleaner while Toxic poisoning puts Landorus-T on a timer, limiting the amount of time it has in battle. Landorus-T should be kept healthy the entire match until it is ready to sweep, allowing it to set up more comfortably. Landorus-T should set up against a physical attacker such as Mimikyu to take advantage of Intimidate allowing it to set up more easily. Landorus-T should time the use of Continental Crush, as it can help break checks such as weakened Celesteela, which would otherwise be impossible to break.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of Landorus-T's teammates appreciate its ability to break walls with Swords Dance and outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Greninja after a Rock Polish. Landorus-T appreciates Hippowdon's ability to set Stealth Rock, as it provides useful chip allowing Landorus-T to clean more easily late-game. Excadrill appreciates Landorus-T's ability to beat Choice Scarf Greninja at +2 Speed, allowing it to run an Adamant nature and become a more fearsome wallbreaker. Excadrill can also break Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Kyurem-B for it in return. Seismitoad and Gastrodon are the team's Water-immune Pokemon. The former is a special wallbreaker that can take on threats such as Azumarill with Sludge Wave, while the latter is a more defensive Pokemon that Landorus-T can fall back on and switch into powerful special attacks such as those of Kyurem-B. It can also provide Toxic support, weakening Landorus-T's checks such as Rotom-W late-game, allowing it to clean more easily. Mamoswine appreciates Landorus-T's ability to dent the other team with its powerful attacks, letting it more readily click Ice Shard to clean through weakened teams. It can also use Knock Off to remove items from defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2's Eviolite, allowing Landorus-T to always OHKO Porygon2 with +2 Continental Crush after Stealth Rock damage. Mega Garchomp is a fantastic mixed attacker, being able to take on a variety of different threats due to its dual STAB types and access to coverage in Fire Blast and Stone Edge. Mega Garchomp can also tank +6 Azumarill's Aqua Jet, allowing the Ground-type team to use the better of the two Water-immune Pokemon in Gastrodon. Dugtrio can support Landorus-T with Memento, allowing it to set up Swords Dance and Rock Polish with more ease.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>With great Attack and Special Attack backed by a fantastic movepool, Kyurem-B is Dragon's most powerful mixed wallbreaker. It uses BoltBeam coverage to hit almost the entire tier at least neutrally and is particularly effective at ripping apart the Flying defensive core of Skarmory, Zapdos, and Mantine as a result. In addition to beating Flying, Kyurem-B also rips apart Steel teams with the use of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire. Access to Roost also improves its longevity throughout a match and supplements its defensive utility thanks to its great bulk and Ice typing making it the only legal Ice switch-in for Dragon teams. While the Ice typing helps Kyurem-B take on Ice-types, it's quite poor defensively otherwise and gives Kyurem-B a host of weaknesses including a weakness to common Fighting- and Rock-type coverage moves. Its Speed, while great for a wallbreaker, is still unimpressive, leaving it quite vulnerable to offense and faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny that outspeed and KO it. Because it is typically a mixed attacker, Kyurem-B struggles with beating mixed walls like Chansey and Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>Kyurem-B has earned a name for itself as the most important Pokemon on Ice teams due to it being one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the metagame. Its amazing natural bulk allows it to survive powerful attacks such as Choice Scarf Victini's V-create and unboosted Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. With the ability Teravolt, it can target Levitate users such as Rotom-W with Earth Power and hit past Mimikyu's Disguise. A secondary Dragon typing grants it a neutrality to Fire-type moves, allowing it to take attacks like Lava Plume from Torkoal and Heatran. Access to Roost grants Kyurem-B reliable recovery, which complements its fantastic bulk. With a Choice Scarf, Kyurem-B can function as an effective revenge killer capable of handling threatening Choice Scarf users like Excadrill and Heracross. Its fantastic Attack and Special Attack stats and solid coverage in Fusion Bolt and Earth Power also make it a great mixed wallbreaker. Its access to great coverage moves makes it incredibly difficult to switch into. However, Kyurem-B is heavily crippled by status conditions such as paralysis and burn. Its typing also leaves it vulnerable to common attacking types like Fighting, Steel, and Fairy, and a weakness to Stealth Rock can severely limit the number of times it can switch in. Even with a Choice Scarf, Kyurem-B is still outsped by other common Choice Scarf users like Victini, Nihilego, and Latios.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Kyurem-B can opt for a BoltBeam + SubRoost set to be more useful against offense and faster threats, but the lack of coverage makes it much less useful against the threats Kyurem-B typically beats. Freeze Shock can be used with Icium Z for a one-time Subzero Slammer that can at least cripple if not OHKO the bulkiest of walls including Mega Sableye and Chansey, making sure Kyurem-B is definitely capable of taking out a wall. Unfortunately, it tends to be unreliable, as Freeze Shock is a two-turn attack and should not be used otherwise, and its other moves will be much weaker. Choice Band boosts Kyurem-B's Attack to unparalleled levels, with Outrage notably being able to 2HKO even Porygon2. However, even if this makes Kyurem-B a wallbreaker that can't be defensively countered, one of Kyurem-B's greatest strengths is in its coverage and being able to switch moves, which Choice Band prevents. Choice Scarf surprises opponents by letting Kyurem-B outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Diancie that otherwise threaten it. The lack of power is noticeable, though, and Kyurem-B will be almost unable to wallbreak at all.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p>A Choice Band can be used with a more physically oriented set. However, Kyurem-B benefits far more from the mixed wallbreaking ability that Life Orb offers. Substitute can be used on wallbreaking sets as a means of keeping Kyurem-B safe from status as well as take advantage of how it can force foes out. However, it would come at the cost of better coverage in Hidden Power Fire.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Because Kyurem-B spreads its offenses across both physical and special attacks to beat specialized walls, mixed walls such as Porygon2 and Mega Sableye have no problem walling it. They do need to be careful of the rare physically oriented variants that are able to 2HKO them, though.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Kyurem-B's middling Speed, it is outsped by many Pokemon, and those with super effective STAB attacks, such as Terrakion and Latios, can OHKO it before it can attack. Even those that cannot OHKO it, such as Mega Swampert, can typically take at least one hit in order to 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types with STAB attacks can typically either outspeed Kyurem-B, like Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir, to OHKO it or force it out. Clefable is able to recover off damage taken from Kyurem-B's Ice Beam with Soft-Boiled and make it take Life Orb recoil to put it in range of Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: While they need to be careful around the possibility of Hidden Power Fire + Earth Power, if Kyurem-B does not carry both, Steel-types that are not weak to the move it does have are able to at least check if not counter it. Without Hidden Power Fire, Mega Scizor can set up on Kyurem-B, and without Earth Power, Magnezone can beat it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: By compounding with Life Orb recoil, residual damage from entry hazards and status can wear down Kyurem-B and make it very easy to take out with either priority or a revenge killer.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status can completely prevent Kyurem-B from wallbreaking, as paralysis will let many walls outspeed it, notably allowing Flying-types to now check it, burns will make its Fusion Bolt very weak, and poison lets some walls stall it out.</p> <h1>Ice</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo outspeed Kyurem-B and threaten to KO it with their STAB moves. However, Keldeo has a chance of being KOed by Fusion Bolt from Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types like Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed Kyurem-B and threaten to KO it with their STAB moves. However, they will be outsped and potentially KOed by Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor, Excadrill, and Jirachi can all threaten to KO Kyurem-B with their Steel-type STAB moves. Jirachi can outspeed Choice Scarf Kyurem-B if it's also holding a Choice Scarf, and while Excadrill won't be outspeeding Kyurem-B, it won't be OHKOed by Earth Power. Mega Scizor will have to watch out for the potential Hidden Power Fire if it ever tries to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie threaten to KO Kyurem-B with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf sets fail to OHKO Tapu Koko or Mega Diancie with Earth Power, although Mega Diancie fears the potential Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Nihilego, and Latios can all outspeed Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and threaten to KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Kyurem-B takes a considerable amount of damage from Stealth Rock as it switches in, putting much more pressure on it to restore its health with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Kyurem-B is largely hindered by status, with paralysis halving its Speed, poison quickly wearing it down, and burn halving its Attack, making it unable to wallbreak effectively.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Life Orb Wallbreaker (Dragon)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is Kyurem-B's most reliable STAB attack, dealing huge damage to almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it and serving as its primary move for wallbreaking. Fusion Bolt forms the powerful BoltBeam coverage combination with Ice Beam to enable Kyurem-B to break Flying and Water defensive cores. As it deals physical damage, it combines with Ice Beam to let Kyurem-B break both physical and special walls. Earth Power is the most useful coverage move, able to 2HKO Steel-type Pokemon such as Klefki and Jirachi that can otherwise switch into Kyurem-B's attacks. Roost gives Kyurem-B longevity, letting it heal the Life Orb recoil and chip damage that it may take from walls like Skarmory. For an all-out attacker moveset, Hidden Power Fire is very useful for breaking offensive Steel teams, especially when used in conjunction with Earth Power. It can also simply replace Earth Power instead, sacrificing perfect anti-Steel coverage for Roost's utility.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Naive nature make Kyurem-B as fast as possible, outspeeding certain Pokemon including Nidoking and Suicune. Because its Special Attack is much lower than its Attack, Kyurem-B prefers to have 252 Special Attack EVs to improve its STAB Ice Beam's damage output. Life Orb's boost makes Kyurem-B even stronger and lets it wallbreak, making sure it can OHKO threats like Tapu Koko and offensive Mega Scizor with its coverage moves. With Teravolt, Kyurem-B is able to ignore defensive abilities such as Mega Venusaur and Mamoswine's Thick Fat, Skarmory and Forretress's Sturdy, and Rotom-W's Levitate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With its decent bulk, Kyurem-B is capable of switching into walls that lack status moves like Skarmory to proceed to force them out with the threat of its powerful attacks. Kyurem-B also serves as a decent switch-in to Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Mamoswine and Tapu Koko, but it should be careful of the possibility of super effective damage, as Mamoswine can carry Superpower and Tapu Koko occasionally uses Dazzling Gleam. Try to keep entry hazards off the field for Kyurem-B, as even with Roost, the residual damage can wear it down very quickly when combined with Life Orb recoil. Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes are especially threatening to Kyurem-B's longevity. For a similar reason, while walls are rarely able to actually damage Kyurem-B seriously, all forms of status are crippling to it, and they should be avoided. Preserving Kyurem-B's health is especially necessary for matchups against Pokemon with strong Ice-type attacks, such as Choice Scarf Greninja, where it is needed to reliably check these threats. Once in play, because Kyurem-B has very few switch-ins, it's typically quite safe to just fire off whatever attacks are strongest against the current foe. Even if the opponent switches out, as long as Kyurem-B is faster, it should still be a huge threat to almost anything that comes in. Kyurem-B is very capable of taking out walls like Toxapex that can stop its teammates from sweeping. As a result, it's important to try to bring it in as often as possible early-game through free or double switches. In some matchups, especially against Flying where Kyurem-B's BoltBeam combination is critical to winning, it's even more important to keep it safe, as getting afflicted by Toxic can lead to the foes beating Kyurem-B in ways that aren't otherwise possible, such as being stalled by Substitute Zapdos. In the Steel matchup, your opponent will try to scout Kyurem-B's moveset; because they don't know what combination of coverage moves to expect, try to use that knowledge to your advantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock damage is very useful for putting some walls such as Alolan Muk into range of Kyurem-B's attacks, so Garchomp is a fantastic partner. While offensive Garchomp is also capable of breaking Steel-types alongside Kyurem-B, defensive sets can serve as a check to threats like Mega Scizor that Kyurem-B may be unable to pressure without Hidden Power Fire. Choice Band Dragonite's incredibly powerful Outrage can break even walls such as Porygon2 and Mega Sableye that Kyurem-B is unable to get past. Together, they form a strong wallbreaking core that very few teams can handle. Hydreigon is another wallbreaking option that can also use Taunt to be a stallbreaker; while not as generally useful as Dragonite, it is more specialized and able to break types such as Psychic and Steel with its strong Dark Pulse and coverage moves. Setup sweepers such as Kommo-o, Mega Latias, and Mega Altaria all greatly appreciate Kyurem-B's wallbreaking presence, as it is capable of taking out Pokemon such as Toxapex and Skarmory that check them. Due to Kyurem-B's poor Speed, a Choice Scarf user such as Latios or Latias is ideal for revenge killing faster Dragon-types and other fast attackers that force Kyurem-B out. They both also have Defog to keep Kyurem-B safe from entry hazards. In exchange, with Earth Power, Kyurem-B can beat walls such as Alolan Muk and Klefki that wall them. While weaker than Latios, Latias brings the much appreciated Healing Wish, which can give Kyurem-B a second chance to finish off remaining walls. If Kyurem-B lacks Roost, Healing Wish becomes even more valuable.</p> "

Ice Beam is Kyurem-B's best Ice-type STAB attack, used to target Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Cradily, and Tapu Bulu as well as Flying-types like Zapdos and Gliscor. Earth Power is important coverage for hitting Fire- and Steel-types like Torkoal, Heatran, and Magnezone. Roost is an option for giving Kyurem-B recovery to offset the damage taken by Life Orb. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Outrage is Kyurem-B’s strongest Dragon-type STAB attack, capable of doing incredible damage to neutral targets like Mew and Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is used to make Kyurem-B as strong and fast as possible. A Naive nature is used to outspeed Pokemon like Nidoking, Jolly Excadrill, and Jolly Landorus-T without decreasing its Attack stat. Naive is chosen over Hasty because Kyurem-B's better physical bulk lets it survive attacks such as Bullet Punch from unboosted Mega Scizor. A Life Orb is used to increase the power of Kyurem-B’s attacks. Teravolt is the only ability it has access to, which allows it to hit Levitate users like Rotom-W with Earth Power and attack past Mimikyu's Disguise. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used in order to give Kyurem-B passive recovery. If Outrage is being used, maximum investment should be put into Attack over Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try bringing Kyurem-B in early-game to wallbreak in order to allow Alolan Sandslash and Cloyster to win late-game. Due to Kyurem-B’s high natural bulk, it's best to bring it in against weaker attacks from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Crobat. However, against more powerful wallbreakers, it's best to bring it in after a teammate has been taken out. Keep entry hazards off the field as much as possible, since they can severely limit the number of times Kyurem-B can switch in. Use Kyurem-B as a way to gain favorable switches; since it's one of the most threatening wallbreakers in the metagame, if the opponent is going to switch, it should be fairly easy to predict what's coming in. Since Kyurem-B is capable of forcing out many Pokemon, try taking advantage of the free turn by using Roost to recover any health lost. Make sure all switch-ins to Outrage have been dealt with before using it, otherwise Kyurem-B can become setup bait for Pokemon like Mega Scizor, get KOed, or force unfavorable switches. Avoid status conditions as much as possible, as they can quickly wear Kyurem-B down and prevent it from wallbreaking effectively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil for Kyurem-B to increase its survivability while also switching into Dragon-type attacks and checking Fighting-types like Keldeo. Avalugg can switch into Steel-types like Jirachi and Excadrill, as well as remove hazards with Rapid Spin to allow Kyurem-B to switch in more safely. Mamoswine and Piloswine can set up Stealth Rock for Kyurem-B, allowing it to wallbreak more effectively. Mamoswine is also capable of revenge killing threats like Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko if it's holding a Choice Scarf, while Piloswine can phaze setup sweepers with Roar and switch into threatening special attackers like Nihilego, Tapu Koko, and Heatran. In return, Kyurem-B breaks through Water- and Flying-types like Slowbro, Mantine, and Skarmory. Alolan Sandslash can check Rock-types like Nihilego and non-Choice Scarf Terrakion, as well as remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to let Kyurem-B switch in safely. In return, Kyurem-B can remove Water-types like Mantine and Slowbro. Lapras can check Mega Scizor for Kyurem-B while also targeting Water-types that are immune to Fusion Bolt like Swampert and Seismitoad with Freeze-Dry. In return, Kyurem-B checks Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos. Weavile can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini, Latios, and Gengar as well as remove items with Knock Off. In return, Kyurem-B beats Skarmory and Toxapex. Cloyster is a great setup sweeper that appreciates Kyurem-B's ability to break through troublesome Water-types like Slowbro and Toxapex.</p> "

Earth Power is another option for hitting Fire- and Steel-types like Rotom-H, Heatran, and Excadrill. Outrage is Kyurem-B’s strongest Dragon-type STAB attack, capable of doing incredible damage to neutral targets like Mew and Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is used to make Kyurem-B as fast and strong as possible. A Naive nature is used to allow Kyurem-B to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Heracross and Excadrill without reducing its Special Attack stat. Naive is chosen over Hasty because Kyurem-B appreciates surviving +2 Bisharp's Sucker Punch. A Choice Scarf is used to let it outspeed threats like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Diancie as well as Choice Scarf users like Heracross, Excadrill, and Landorus-T. Teravolt is Kyurem-B's only ability, which allows it to hit Mega Venusaur super effectively with Ice Beam and hit Volt Absorb users like Lanturn with Fusion Bolt.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's a good idea to conserve Kyurem-B until late-game when all its checks have been removed. However, it can also be sent out frequently to revenge kill threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B relies heavily on prediction, so make sure to predict when Pokemon such as Swampert or Landorus-T switch into it. Try bringing Kyurem-B in on weak attacks such as Brave Bird from Crobat in order to get it in safely and force something out. Keep entry hazards off the field as much as possible, since they can severely limit the number of times Kyurem-B can switch in. Be careful about what move Kyurem-B locks itself into, or it may risk becoming setup bait for Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Avoid status conditions as much as possible, as they can wear down Kyurem-B and make it unable to sweep effectively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil for Kyurem-B to increase its survivability while also switching into Dragon-type attacks. In return, Kyurem-B is able to check faster Fighting-types like Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny. Avalugg can switch into Fighting-types like Heracross and Infernape as well as remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to allow Kyurem-B to switch in more freely. Mamoswine and Piloswine can set up Stealth Rock for Kyurem-B, allowing it to sweep more effectively. Mamoswine can also revenge kill faster Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Latios with Ice Shard, while Piloswine can switch into threatening special attackers like Nihilego, Tapu Koko, and Heatran. Lapras can check Mega Scizor for Kyurem-B while also targeting Water-types that are immune to Fusion Bolt like Swampert and Seismitoad with Freeze-Dry. In return, Kyurem-B checks Electric-types like Magnezone and Zapdos, as well as faster Rock-types like Mega Diancie. Cloyster is a great setup sweeper that appreciates Kyurem-B's ability to outspeed and remove special attackers like Mega Charizard Y and Landorus. Weavile can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini, Latios, and Gengar as well as remove items with Knock Off. It also greatly appreciates Kyurem-B's ability to beat Fairy-types like Azumarill and Mega Diancie. Alolan Sandslash is another revenge killer capable of beating faster Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Garchomp for Kyurem-B under hail, as well as being able to switch into Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks. In return, Kyurem-B can check Water-types like Gyarados and Keldeo that Alolan Sandslash is unable to KO.</p> "

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Keldeo is one of the best offensive Pokemon on Water-type teams; its high Speed, which lets it outpace notable Monotype threats such as Nihilego and Volcarona, allows it to function as an excellent revenge killer. Its solid STAB options, Scald, Hydro Pump, and Secret Sword, make it difficult to switch into and let it also function as a wallbreaker; the last of these makes it one of the few special attackers that can take out Chansey. With Taunt and Calm Mind, Keldeo serves as an effective stallbreaker capable of taking on its typical checks such as Mantine and Toxapex. Keldeo's resistances to Bug, Rock, and Dark, alongside its solid bulk, allow it to function as an offensive switch-in to those attacks and beat Pokemon one-on-one that it may not OHKO. However, a lack of coverage options leaves Keldeo fairly one-dimensional in terms of what it hits, and its reliance on Choice items means that it can be setup bait even to Pokemon it might otherwise take on, such as Volcarona and Dragonite.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Keldeo is a necessity on Fighting-type teams because it is one of the few special wallbreakers that the type has access to. Its good Speed stat of base 108 allows it to outspeed the crowded base 100 Speed tier as well as threats such as Landorus. Its ability to handle the physical walls such as Skarmory and Doublade that would stop most of the physical attackers on Fighting teams is extremely valuable. Keldeo also has a powerful STAB combination and essentially is a mixed attacker because of Secret Sword, which targets the opposing Pokemon's Defense. Keldeo can use Taunt and Calm Mind to become a stallbreaker and take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mantine to become a dangerous setup sweeper. Keldeo's respectable bulk enables it to survive Choice Scarf Victini's Bolt Strike at full health, and its good defensive typing helps it handle Mega Scizor. However, Keldeo has a very shallow movepool, and its STAB moves have many switch-ins such as Latios and Slowbro. Its Speed tier also falls short of important threats such as Latios, Latias, and Thundurus. Keldeo also wants to use both Hydro Pump and Icy Wind and thus must choose between extra coverage or a stronger Water-type STAB move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>Focus Blast is an option for extra power on the Choice Specs set, but it doesn't hit any particularly important targets and is inaccurate. Hidden Power Poison may be used on the Choice Scarf set to take out Tapu Bulu, but it has no other use and gives a free turn to the rest of Tapu Bulu's team. Life Orb gives Keldeo a similar damage boost to Choice Specs without locking it in to one attack, but the damage reduction is noticeable and the loss of HP leaves it unable to survive hits such as Choice Scarf Greninja's Extrasensory. Leftovers and Scald can be used over Waterium Z and Hydro Pump to give Keldeo a more solid matchup against walls; however, Keldeo then loses out on its immediate ability to wallbreak with Hydro Vortex.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Keldeo can use a Choice Scarf instead of Choice Specs, but Fighting teams generally need the power from Choice Specs and have a multitude of better Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Heracross. Keldeo can also use a Life Orb instead so that it can freely switch moves and possibly use Taunt, but the recoil wears down Keldeo quickly, and it is also noticeably weaker. Keldeo can run Scald with Leftovers so that it has a better form of passive recovery and longevity in the fight. This is also normally run if you want to use this set alongside Kommo-o, which relies on the Z-Move in order to do well.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur can switch into any of Keldeo's attacks, has reliable recovery in Synthesis, and may force it out with Giga Drain. In rain, the Choice Specs set can 2HKO it on the switch with Hydro Pump, but both of Venusaur's types have other answers in any case.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex can switch into the Choice Scarf set easily and has both Regenerator and recovery to make Keldeo's life difficult. Even Hidden Power Electric from the Choice Specs set has a poor chance to 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Super effective attackers such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, and Latios give Keldeo issues. To make matters worse, most of these Pokemon will either outspeed or survive an attack from Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gengar, Alolan Raichu, and Choice Scarf Greninja can outspeed Keldeo and remove it. For the Choice Specs set, the same may be done by anything faster than base 108 Speed such as Tapu Koko and Mega Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon: Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Volcanion give Keldeo serious issues, especially since they or their team can almost always readily take Secret Sword.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-resistant Pokemon: Bulky Psychic- and Fairy-type Pokemon give Keldeo issues, as Keldeo cannot bypass their Special Defense. While none of them counter all of its sets, the likes of Clefable, Mew, Slowbro, and Zapdos give Keldeo trouble.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: Mega Venusaur resists both of Keldeo's STAB types and threatens to KO it with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex resists both of Keldeo's STAB types and can fish for burns with Scald while recovering off any damage Keldeo would do to it.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with the ability Storm Drain or Water Absorb such as Gastrodon and Mantine can usually switch safely into Keldeo, but Mantine fears the 2HKO from Hidden Power Electric. These Pokemon, however, must be wary of stallbreaker Keldeo, as it generally forces out these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Toxapex, and Mantine both resist Keldeo's STAB moves and wear Keldeo down with status moves. The stallbreaker set forces out these Pokemon, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types such as Celebi, Latios, and Latias are able to switch into Keldeo easily and force it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Clefable can switch into Keldeo, but the former doesn't want switch into Scald because of the chance to burn, and Clefable cannot switch into Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Band Dragonite, naturally faster Pokemon such as Gengar, and Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill can all KO Keldeo with some previous damage.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Keldeo's primary STAB move, hitting most of the metagame for solid damage and can crippling switch-ins with a burn. Secret Sword is a secondary STAB option that allows Keldeo to muscle past special walls such as Chansey. Hidden Power Electric hits Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine that resist Keldeo's STAB moves but is weaker against neutral targets. Icy Wind allows Keldeo to better handle Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios and Dragonite. Hydro Pump gives Keldeo a bit of extra power to break switch-ins such as Zapdos and Mew, but it comes at the cost of coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs, alongside Choice Specs, maximize Keldeo's damage output and turn it into a powerful wallbreaker. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid Nature allow Keldeo to outpace most of the metagame, including threats such as Kyurem-B, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard Y. 4 Special Defense EVs ensure that Download gives an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost to Porygon2 and Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early-game, bring Keldeo in as often as possible to break down the opponents's defensive core. Scald should be used when feasible to weaken Keldeo's checks and discourage physical attackers; its solid burn chance and 100% accuracy make it highly spammable. Keep entry hazards up when possible to discourage switching and weaken Keldeo's answers. Don't use Hydro Pump unnecessarily, as in many situations, Keldeo's other attacks will suffice, and it has an unfortunate miss chance. Keldeo's high Speed and solid bulk limit opportunities for the foe to revenge kill it and mean it can also function as a decent late-game sweeper, so keeping it healthy until then is often a good idea. Be wary of Choice-locking Keldeo into the wrong move so it is not turned into setup bait; Dragonite, for instance, can freely set up on a Keldeo locked into Hydro Pump or Secret Sword and deal heavy damage to the team. Avoid paralysis when possible, as the loss of Speed makes Keldeo's job much harder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Greninja pairs particularly well with this set, as it can take over Keldeo's job as a revenge killer; in return, Keldeo can take on defensive walls such as Chansey and Zapdos that would otherwise give Greninja trouble. Mega Sharpedo appreciates Keldeo's ability to break holes in opposing teams so it can sweep late-game; Sharpedo can also eliminate Keldeo answers such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro. Gyarados acts as an answer to Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Keldeo, particularly Mega Venusaur, and appreciates Keldeo's removing roadblocks to its sweep. Stealth Rock setters such as Swampert, Seismitoad, and Empoleon are handy for wearing down switch-ins; the first two also function as answers to Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko. Pelipper can set rain to boost Water-type attacks, bring Keldeo in safely with U-turn, and take on Grass-type Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Mega Venusaur for Keldeo. Kingdra appreciates Keldeo's wallbreaking ability to break past its answers; in return, Kingdra can take out Mega Venusaur and functions as an excellent cleaner. Volt Switch users such as Lanturn and Rotom-W are handy to bring in Keldeo safely; Lanturn also acts as an effective check to Electric-type Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and can cure paralysis with Heal Bell. Toxapex can switch into offensive threats that force Keldeo out such as Greninja, can reduce the threat of setup, and can support Keldeo's wallbreaking ability with Toxic Spikes. Mantine functions as an answer to special attackers that force Keldeo out such as Choice Specs Kingdra and can remove entry hazards to allow Keldeo to come in multiple times.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Keldeo's main STAB attack and lets it take on Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mega Scizor. Secret Sword allows Keldeo to hit key threats such as Ferrothorn and Chansey and is able to hit Water-immune Pokemon such as Mantine and Gastrodon. Calm Mind boosts Keldeo's Special Attack and Special Defense, turning it into a potent wallbreaker. Taunt allows Keldeo to break walls by preventing them from using their recovery moves and spreading status.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature lets Keldeo hit as hard as possible while Speed tying with Pokemon such as Galvantula. Waterium Z allows Keldeo's Hydro Pump to become Hydro Vortex, which can help it take out Pokemon such as Zapdos after a boost and minor chip damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When Keldeo forces a switch against Pokemon such as Armaldo, it should take advantage of this by setting up Calm Mind. Keldeo should use Taunt to block walls from recovering off damage and spreading status, allowing it to easily break these walls and use them as setup bait. Keldeo should preserve Hydro Vortex until it can secure an OHKO against a threat such as Clefable. Generally, if Keldeo is going to use Hydro Vortex against a wall, either make sure it is weakened to the point of being KOed or Taunt it before attacking. Keldeo should avoid status at all costs, as all status conditions affect its ability to clean. Keldeo best sets up when all of its checks such as Tapu Koko are gone or when slower checks such as Rotom-W are weakened to a point where it can take them on. Keldeo should set up against walls like Toxapex and Mantine in the Water matchup, as it can easily Taunt them, preventing them from being able to wall Keldeo by recovering off its damage and removing boosts with Haze. In the Water matchup it should also set up after threats such as Mega Sharpedo have been removed, as Mega Sharpedo can revenge kill Keldeo with Psychic Fangs. In the crucial matchup against Flying teams, Keldeo should be used to break walls such as Celesteela so Greninja has an easier time sweeping late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of Keldeo's teammates appreciate its ability to break down walls such as Celesteela with Taunt and act as a powerful setup sweeper that can take on threats such as Zapdos and Hydreigon. Toxapex provides Keldeo with Toxic Spikes support, slowly chipping down Keldeo's checks. It can also act as a switch-in to Grass-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech. Choice Scarf Greninja acts as a nice revenge killer for Keldeo, checking key threats such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, and Latios. Mantine provides a Ground-type immunity and Defog support for Keldeo while also acting as a blanket switch-in to strong special attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor. In return, it appreciates Keldeo's ability to beat an overwhelming majority of hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Ferrothorn, taking pressure off Mantine as the team's Defogger. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Swampert, Mega Swampert, and Gastrodon are essential on any Water team. The former two are the premier Stealth Rock setters for Water teams and are able to phaze setup sweepers with Roar, and while the latter might not have access to Stealth Rock, its access to reliable recovery makes it a much better switch-in to Electric-types. Gastrodon also can use Toxic on Pokemon such as Mantine and Slowbro for Keldeo, giving it an easier time breaking past a few of its checks. Mega Sharpedo forms a dangerous wallbreaking core with Keldeo, as Keldeo can break through Steel-types like Ferrothorn, whereas Mega Sharpedo can take on Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mega Latias for Keldeo. Keldeo also appreciates Mega Sharpedo's ability to act as a cleaner after a few Speed boosts. Rotom-W acts as another Defog Pokemon with an immunity to Ground-type attacks and a handy neutrality to Electric-type coverage, allowing it to Defog on Pokemon Mantine can't such as Zapdos. Rotom-W is also a fantastic slow pivot that can bring Keldeo in safely with Volt Switch and can give it more opportunities to set up by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Keldeo's most spammable attack, as it has solid Base Power and has a chance to burn foes, which helps dissuade switch-ins. Secret Sword is Keldeo's primary Fighting STAB option and allows it to bypass special walls such as Chansey. Hydro Pump is a more powerful move and is Keldeo's best option for revenge killing Tapu Koko. Icy Wind hits Pokemon such as Dragonite that resist both of Keldeo's STAB moves and slows down foes to aid in revenge killing; in particular, this is useful for taking on Choice Scarf Latios, since the reduction of Speed will allow Keldeo to outpace it after hitting it on the switch. Hidden Power Electric is another option to deal with the likes of Mantine, Pelipper, and Tapu Fini, but Choice Scarf Keldeo isn't strong enough to make full use of it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used alongside a Choice Scarf to make Keldeo as fast as possible, which allows it to outspeed threats such as Swift Swim Mega Swampert, Choice Scarf Victini, and Tapu Koko. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Keldeo's damage output and let it hit as hard as possible. 4 EVs are placed into Special Defense to ensure that Porygon2 and Porygon-Z get an Attack boost from Download.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Keldeo in on boosted sweepers or faster threats such as Volcarona and Tapu Koko to force them out. Keep entry hazards up whenever possible, as Keldeo relies on the chip damage to wear down the Pokemon it forces out and to pressure its switch-ins. Using Scald on forced switches is generally helpful to spread burns and chip away at opposing checks. Be wary of Choice locking into a weaker move like Icy Wind—the opponent may take advantage of a KOed Pokemon to pivot into a setup sweeper such as Mew, which can shrug off the damage. Keep Keldeo away from paralysis whenever possible, as the halved Speed greatly reduces its effectiveness. Don't use Hydro Pump when Scald or Secret Sword would work just as well, as its low accuracy reduces its reliability.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Greninja is a must-have on nearly any Water-type team, and it appreciates Keldeo taking on faster Pokemon such as Tapu Koko; in return, Greninja can deal with troublesome Poison-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Gyarados serves as an excellent check to Grass-type Pokemon and can act as a potent sweeper when given a free turn against the defensive Pokemon Keldeo forces in. Manaphy is another solid teammate, as it can take on the defensive cores that Choice Scarf Keldeo cannot effectively break such as balanced Poison and Flying teams. Mega Swampert can set up Stealth Rock for Keldeo, making it harder to switch into, and it takes pressure off Keldeo to check Tapu Koko while forcing out the likes of Toxapex. Azumarill puts a lot of pressure on Psychic-type teams and special walls for Keldeo and appreciates the reduced reliance on Aqua Jet for revenge killing. Pelipper handles Grass-type threats such as Mega Venusaur and sets rain to boost the power of Keldeo's Water-type attacks. Mantine can handle special setup sweepers that take advantage of Keldeo's Choice lock such as Volcarona and can clear entry hazards with Defog; it also functions as a defensive pivot and provides a Grass-type neutrality. Empoleon can set Stealth Rock, clear entry hazards to prevent stacking, and function as a Latios answer for Keldeo. Toxapex is neutral to Grass and can freely switch into many attackers; it can also support Keldeo's cleaning with Toxic Spikes. Mega Sharpedo can heavily pressure the Psychic teams that give Keldeo trouble and can weaken offensvie threats to aid Keldeo's revenge killing.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is a safe, relatively strong move in general and has a decent chance to burn and cripple Keldeo's switch-ins, such as Zapdos. Secret Sword allows Keldeo to hit special walls such as Chansey for much more damage than its other moves would do. Be careful when using it, though, because there are many physically defensive walls that resist Fighting or can switch into a Secret Sword such as Slowbro and Skarmory. Hidden Power Electric is needed to hit Keldeo's would-be counters in Slowbro, Toxapex, and Mantine. Icy Wind hits the Dragon-types such as Latios and Dragonite that could otherwise switch into Keldeo's other attacks, as well as having the added benefit of lowering the Speed of an opposing Pokemon. Hydro Pump is an extremely strong alternative that is able to break through most specially defensive walls that do not resist Water, such as Zapdos.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used so that Keldeo can maximize its damage output. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Keldeo to outspeed threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Landorus as well as Speed tie with opposing Keldeo. 4 Special Defense EVs prevent Download users like Porygon-Z from getting a boost to their Special Attack. Choice Specs allows Keldeo to break through most of the walls in the metagame, such as Zapdos and Mew, after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keldeo should be brought in as often as possible to wear down or threaten out the physically defensive Pokemon that wall the majority of Fighting-type teams, such as Skarmory. Scald is a safe move to use in general because of its chance to inflict a burn on Pokemon attempting to switch into Keldeo. Although Hydro Pump is an incredibly powerful wallbreaking move, be careful when using it because of its low PP and shaky accuracy. Spreading burns with Scald and weakening Keldeo's checks with Hydro Pump early-game can allow Keldeo to sweep late-game. Keldeo forces a lot of switches, so you can capitalize on this by double switching to a Pokemon that handles what your opponent attempted to switch into Keldeo. Preserving Keldeo's health is incredibly important, not only because it allows Keldeo to wallbreak throughout the battle, but also because Keldeo's good defensive typing allows it to function as an offensive check to Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Kingdra. Keldeo's coverage moves deal significant damage to their targets such as Slowbro and Mantine, but they are weak otherwise. Because of this, Keldeo should avoid locking itself into one of its coverage moves because otherwise opposing Pokemon such as Double Dance Landorus-T can set up on it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Almost all Fighting-type Pokemon work well with Keldeo because of its incredible ability to break through physically defensive walls. Choice Scarf Heracross and Terrakion are excellent teammates for Keldeo, as the former can deal with bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and the latter with Flying-types like Mantine. They also can revenge kill or threaten out Pokemon that outspeed Keldeo. In return, Keldeo easily deals with Doublade and Skarmory, which otherwise can easily switch into Heracross and Terrakion. Keldeo greatly benefits from Stealth Rock support to break Sturdy on Skarmory and Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Breloom. Infernape is the more offensive of the two options, and it is able to check Grass-types, most notably Celebi, as well as relieve pressure off Keldeo by providing another check to Mega Scizor. Cobalion is the other option and is much bulkier, can safely bring Keldeo in with Volt Switch, and can cripple threats such as Latios with Thunder Wave as well as switch into Latios's Psyshock. Kommo-o and Breloom also appreciate Keldeo's ability to break down physically defensive walls. In return, Kommo-o can wall and set up on one of Keldeo's counters, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom can beat most Water-type Pokemon that could try to switch into Keldeo. Keldeo also resists Fire and Ice, allowing it to switch into some of Breloom's checks, such as Torkoal. Hawlucha is another teammate that can deal with Grass-types, specifically Mega Venusaur, and in return Keldeo handles the Pokemon that wall Hawlucha such as Doublade, allowing Hawlucha to sweep with Swords Dance and Unburden.</p> "

Hydro Pump is Keldeo's most powerful STAB move and is capable of hitting defensive Pokemon like Mega Sableye, Zapdos, and Gliscor very hard. Secret Sword is used as Keldeo's secondary STAB attack that pressures specially defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack with a Timid nature allows Keldeo to hit as hard and fast as possible. Waterium Z allows Keldeo to use a powerful nuke in Hydro Vortex that can KO walls like Mega Sableye, Celesteela, and Zapdos. 4 Special Defense EVs cause Download users to boost in Attack rather than Special Attack, which is useful against Download Porygon2, as it allows Keldeo to take more hits from it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keldeo should ideally be used to blow holes through the enemy team so that its teammates can clean up, so taking out key walls like Mega Sableye and Zapdos is very important. Try to bluff a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set in certain situations so that you can potentially force out opposing Pokemon, allowing you to get a free turn to set up Calm Mind. This set excels at stopping common walls like Toxapex and Mantine from using Haze to remove stat boosts, recovering health, and using status moves to hinder Keldeo's usefulness. Be sure to use Taunt on an incoming wall so that you can either force it out or KO it more easily. Doing this allows you to deal with Pokemon like Celesteela and Mandibuzz more easily, preventing them from using status moves, allowing Keldeo to get more Calm Mind boosts. You can also do this on naturally forced switches or on passive Pokemon like Mega Sableye that can't do any significant damage to Keldeo. Avoid getting afflicted with any form of status ailment, as they wear down Keldeo throughout the match and can limit the number of times Keldeo can come in. Try to preserve Keldeo's Z-Move for use on a wall like Celesteela that your team struggles to beat, as you don't want to waste it on a Pokemon that could have been KOed by one of Keldeo's teammates. Picking apart defensive cores with Keldeo's Z-Move allows it to become as effective as possible, and this is especially important against types like Flying, which rely on their defensive cores to function properly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>The entire team appreciates Keldeo's ability to stallbreak walls like Toxapex, Mantine, and Celesteela and prevent them from healing or inflicting status ailments. Mega Gallade appreciates Keldeo's ability to take care of Pokemon like Mega Sableye, which otherwise make Gallade's job harder. In return, Mega Gallade breaks down troublesome walls like Mega Venusaur and Jellicent for Keldeo, which usually can't force these Pokemon out. Terrakion works very well with Keldeo, as it can revenge kill threats like Tornadus-T, Mega Pidgeot, and Tapu Koko with a Choice Scarf set. Keldeo in return gets rid of walls like Celesteela and Mega Sableye so that Terrakion can have an easier time cleaning. Cobalion supports Keldeo with Stealth Rock and by slowing down threats like Greninja with Thunder Wave. It also uses its Steel typing and decent defenses to help take hits from Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Latios for Keldeo. Breloom provides support with its ability to put opposing Pokemon to sleep, allowing Keldeo to find more opportunities to set up Calm Mind. Buzzwole and Heracross both help revenge kill Psychic-types like Celebi and Mega Latios with their Bug-type STAB moves. Buzzwole, in particular, has good coverage moves in Earthquake and Ice Punch, which help get rid of checks to Keldeo like Tapu Koko after Stealth Rock damage and always force out Landorus-T. Heracross, on the other hand, helps Pursuit trap Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Victini, which is a threat to Keldeo. Lucario is another wallbreaker that appreciates Keldeo's ability to break through walls like Celesteela and Mantine. In return, it can help take care of Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Diancie for Keldeo.</p> "

  "Meloetta": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Meloetta's high Special Attack stat, massive movepool, and great offensive typing make it a dangerous special wallbreaker that can take care of passive walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon, and its great Special Defense allows it to take attacks from Pokemon like Clefable, Latios, and Zapdos. Meloetta helps balance Normal greatly, serving as a special attacker, and its STAB Psychic moves help its more passive teammates like Chansey and Porygon2 deal with threats like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur in the Poison matchup. Meloetta can also take care of faster Pokemon like Gengar and Latios. However, its base 90 Speed tier is quite mediocre to fulfill a role of a revenge killer or wallbreaker, as it gets outsped by common Pokemon in the tier like Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Terrakion even when running Choice Scarf. While its Psychic typing can help with some matchups, it also leaves Meloetta weak to moves like Knock Off and Pursuit from common Pokemon like Bisharp and Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Meloetta has a mediocre Defense stat that limits what it can switch into because it gets easily KOed by the likes of Victini and Excadrill. It also faces competition with Porygon-Z as its team's special attacker because of Z-Conversion transforming Porygon-Z into a Ghost-type and making it immune to Fighting-type moves.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Meloetta's part-Normal typing allows it to take on Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mimikyu and Blacephalon, which pose a huge threat for Psychic-type teams. It comes with good Special Attack along with an average Speed stat that makes it a formidable offensive threat. Having remarkable special bulk allows it to take on weak special attackers such as Rotom-W and Mantine, as well as unboosted Volcarona. With Shadow Ball at its disposal, Meloetta performs very well in the mirror matchups, while having good coverage moves such as Thunderbolt and Focus Blast allows it to take on Pokemon that are troublesome for Psychic-type teams such as Dark-, Water- and Steel-types like Tyranitar, Mantine, Heatran, and Celesteela. However, Meloetta only has a few uses in taking on Mimikyu and using Shadow Ball in a mirror matchup; it's otherwise outclassed as a wallbreaker by other Psychic-type Pokemon such as Victini and Latios. Moreover, low physical bulk and a below average Speed stat leave Meloetta exposed against fast physical threats and Pursuit users such as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Gallade, and Mega Aerodactyl.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Psyshock can be used over Psychic on the Choice Specs set to hit Pokemon like Chansey, but it doesn't come with a chance of getting a Special Defense drop and cannot take care of Buzzwole. Dazzling Gleam is another option to deal with troubling Dark-types such as Mega Sableye and Hydreigon, but this means usually dropping an important move like Hyper Voice. A Modest nature can be used over Timid on the Choice Specs set, but this makes Meloetta lose the ability to outspeed Nidoking and Mamoswine. Trick can be run to cripple passive Pokemon like Mantine or a setup Pokemon like Bisharp at the cost of dropping one of its coverage moves. Thunderbolt can be used on the Choice Specs set to hit Pokemon like Mantine and Celesteela, but this forces Meloetta to drop a move that it needs like Focus Blast.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p>Meloetta can run a Choice Scarf set to act as a revenge killer, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Volcarona, Mega Gallade, and Mega Aerodactyl by exchanging power for Speed. Having U-turn lets Meloetta safely pivot out against its counters on the switch such as Alolan Muk. Running Dazzling Gleam lets Meloetta hit Mega Sableye. It has no other relevant use, though, as most Dragon-type Pokemon outspeed Meloetta.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Pursuit: Meloetta can easily be Pursuit trapped by Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Alolan Muk, and Scizor, leaving Meloetta heavily damaged or KOed.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Focus Blast is too unreliable to effectively deal with the Dark-types that counter Meloetta, as it can easily get KOed by STAB Knock Off, Pursuit, or Sucker Punch from common Dark-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Alolan Muk, and Krookodile. It also has trouble with Mega Sableye, as it can easily take any of Meloetta's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types: Bug-types like Heracross and Scizor easily scare out Meloetta with their super effective moves, but Heracross has to be wary if Meloetta is using a Choice Scarf. Both of these Pokemon also commonly run Pursuit, which heavily dents Meloetta.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey and Mantine can easily wall Meloetta, cripple it with Toxic, and recover any type of damage they receive.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers like Victini, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Bulu threaten Meloetta and KO it due to their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: Physical wallbreakers like Azumarill, Excadrill, and Dragonite can easily KO Meloetta from full HP due to its mediocre defenses.</p> <h1>Psychic</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey's monstrous special bulk and its access to Soft-Boiled allow it to take on any of Meloetta's attacks without any trouble and beat it with Seismic Toss. Chansey also has Thunder Wave, which can cripple Meloetta by halving its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Muk</strong>: Alolan Muk can comfortably switch into any attack from Meloetta and beat it with Knock Off and Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Defensive Dark-types such as Mandibuzz and Mega Sableye can take attacks comfortably from Meloetta. However, Mandibuzz needs to be careful about Thunderbolt. Offensive Dark-types such as Weavile and Greninja outspeed Meloetta and can reliably beat it.</p> <p><strong>Physical attackers: Meloetta's poor physical bulk leaves it vulnerable against many physical Pokemon, such as Victini and Mega Aerodactyl. It is also vulnerable to common priority users such as Azumarill, Bisharp, and Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Meloetta without Psyshock will have trouble handling common specially defensive Pokemon, such as Gastrodon, Chansey, and Volcarona.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is powerful STAB move that also goes through Substitute, which is useful against Pokemon like Suicune, Sharpedo, and Zapdos. Psychic is another powerful STAB move that helps with breaking passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur and helps with Fighting-types like Terrakion and Infernape. Shadow Ball helps greatly with Ghost- and Psychic-types and allows Meloetta to break Gengar and Latias so its passive teammates don't have to worry about dealing with a Special Defense drop or Trick. Focus Blast helps with Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is run with maximum EVs in Speed to outspeed Pokemon like Nidoking and Zapdos. 252 EVs in Special Attack along with a Choice Specs turn Meloetta into a powerful wallbreaker. The ability Serene Grace can make secondary effects happen more often with Psychic, Shadow Ball, or Focus Blast.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Meloetta early-game, as its wallbreaking power can let its STAB moves easily dent walls and threats to its teammates. Meloetta has great Special Defense, so switch it in on neutral or resisted special attacks such as Rotom-W’s Hydro Pump and Clefable's Moonblast. Meloetta can also switch in safely on passive walls that do not threaten it like Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, and Hippowdon. Take advantage of a slow U-turn from Staraptor or following a teammate fainting to safely bring in Meloetta. Do not bring it in on physical wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Diggersby, and Sand Rush Excadrill, because it will get easily KOed. Similarly, Meloetta should never stay in on potential Choice Scarf users that can threaten it such as Landorus-T, Tapu Bulu, and Victini, as they can KO it before it can hit back. Be careful around walls with Knock Off such as Gliscor, as losing its item greatly hurts Meloetta's wallbreaking power. Be wary of potential Pursuit users that can trap and remove Meloetta such as Alolan Muk, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl. Also, be careful what move Meloetta uses, as locking into the wrong move makes it vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by the likes of Tyranitar and Alolan Muk or set up on by Pokemon like Bisharp and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey can sponge special attacks from threats like Tapu Koko and Hydreigon that threaten Meloetta. It can also set up Stealth Rock to break Focus Sash and limit how many times a Pokemon can be brought in, which allows Meloetta to secure KOs on Thundurus-T and Landorus. Porygon2 can take physical attacks that Meloetta cannot like Victini's V-create and Mega Sharpedo's Crunch. Staraptor takes care of entry hazards for Meloetta with Defog, has Intimidate to help with threats like Mega Lopunny and Infernape, and can help Meloetta get safely into the field with its slow U-turn, which can easily help preserve Meloetta for later in the game. Mega Lopunny can provide great help in the Dark-type matchup and take care of threats like Mega Sableye and Bisharp. Mega Pidgeot can help take care of Fighting Pokemon as well as use U-turn to get it in safely on a predicted switch. Diggersby is a great physical wallbreaker that can take care of threats for Meloetta such as Mantine with Return and Celesteela with Fire Punch. Ditto can help against common setup users like Mega Charizard X and Mega Gallade by threatening a reverse sweep and pressuring them, and it is able to outpace any Pokemon that is not Choice Scarf itself thanks to its own Choice Scarf. Smeargle is a great suicide lead on hyper offensive Normal, setting hazards and allowing Meloetta to outspeed Pokemon it usually could not thanks to Sticky Web.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is a powerful STAB move that can revenge kill Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Choice Specs Keldeo. Shadow Ball helps greatly with Ghost- and Psychic-types and allows Meloetta to beat Gengar and Mega Gallade thanks to its Choice Scarf. Focus Blast helps with Rock- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Stakataka. U-turn is run to gain momentum, since Meloetta often forces in Pokemon like Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Alolan Muk. Hyper Voice is another STAB move that can do neutral damage as a safe opening attack and goes through Substitute, a move that Pokemon like Mega Sharpedo and Zapdos commonly use.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is run with maximum Speed EVs and Choice Scarf to outpace common Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill, Heracross, and Tapu Bulu. 252 EVs in Special Attack help maximize Meloetta's damage output. The ability Serene Grace can increase the chance that opposing stats will drop from Psychic, Shadow Ball, or Focus Blast.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's best to bring in Meloetta against threats that it takes a hit well from and beats such as Zapdos, Blacephalon, Nidoking, and passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, and Torkoal. Bluffing a Choice Specs set with U-turn is an option to gain momentum on the opponent. Another way to get Meloetta in safely is on a predicted switch, which can lead to gaining momentum with U-turn. Do not bring it in on physical wallbreakers like Azumarill, Diggersby, and Dragonite, because with Meloetta's poor physical bulk, it will get easily KOed. Be wary of Knock Off users such as Mega Sableye, Azumarill, and Landorus-T, as the loss of Meloetta's Choice Scarf leaves it outpaced by Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Also be careful around status moves such as Toxic or Thunder Wave from common users such as Zapdos, Chansey, and Celesteela, because Toxic puts Meloetta on a timer and Thunder Wave causes it to be outpaced by Pokemon such as Excadrill. Be aware that Meloetta's much lower damage output will give its item away to the opponent and give away that common walls like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Slowbro can withstand attacks from it. Be careful with locking into the wrong move, as this can lead to a dangerous situation where Meloetta can get Pursuit trapped or set up on by the likes of Mega Charizard X and Bisharp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey can set up Stealth Rock to help Meloetta secure KOs and soak up attacks from Pokemon that threaten it like Alolan Raichu and Greninja. Porygon2 is a staple for Normal balance teams with its ability to take on strong physical attacks from Pokemon that Meloetta cannot like Victini and Mega Scizor. Staraptor takes care of entry hazards with Defog, which can help prolong Meloetta's longevity, punishes physical attackers with Rocky Helmet and lower their Attack with Intimidate, and provide Meloetta momentum with its slow U-turn and gets it on the field safely to deal with faster threats like Terrakion and Infernape. Meloetta struggles with Dark-type Pokemon, so Mega Lopunny helps greatly with Dark- and Steel-types like Alolan Muk, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn. Mega Pidgeot takes care of Fighting Pokemon and can also help in the Steel matchup, taking on Pokemon that Meloetta struggles with like Celesteela and Heatran with Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ground. Diggersby is a powerful physical wallbreaker that can take care of threats to Meloetta like Zapdos with Return, Mega Scizor with Fire Punch, and Empoleon with Earthquake.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Meloetta's main and most powerful STAB attack, allowing it to deal heavy damage to targets such as Toxapex. Psyshock can be used instead in order to hit specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Volcarona at the cost of some power. Thunderbolt is a decent coverage move that lets Meloetta handle Flying- and Water-types, such as Celesteela, Mantine, and Gyarados. Shadow Ball allows Meloetta to hit Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mimikyu and Blacephalon as well as break down Psychic-type teams. Focus Blast lets Meloetta hit Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Hyper Voice is Meloetta's secondary STAB attack, allowing it to deal with Substitute users such as Zapdos, as well as deal heavy damage to Alolan Muk.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Meloetta reach 306 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Nidoking, Adamant Mimikyu, and Gyarados. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Meloetta to hit as hard as possible. Choice Specs boosts Meloetta's Special Attack greatly, allowing it to OHKO Mimikyu reliably.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to use Meloetta's wallbreaking potential early-game to create space for late-game cleaners, such as Mega Gallade. Since Meloetta lacks recovery, try to avoid switching into attacks directly. Instead, try to pivot with teammates such as Jirachi and Mew. However, use Meloetta's good special bulk to switch in against offensively weak Pokemon that Meloetta can reliably beat, such as Mantine, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur. Protect users such as Celesteela and Toxapex will scout Meloetta's moves and take advantage of the Choice Specs. To prevent this, try to double switch when Meloetta is up against them. Be wary with your switches if the opponent has a Pursuit Pokemon at their disposal. Pursuit users such as Alolan Muk and Mega Aerodactyl can either OHKO Meloetta or deal a significant amount of damage to it. Utilize Meloetta's part-Normal typing to pivot into Ghost-type attacks and retaliate with Shadow Ball. Avoid getting paralyzed by Klefki at all costs, as Meloetta will lose its capability to check Mimikyu reliably. Furthermore, the loss of Speed will leave it vulnerable against slower offensive Pokemon such as Dragonite and Breloom.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gallade forms a good offensive core with Meloetta. Its STAB Close Combat aids Meloetta with taking on Steel- and Normal-type Pokemon more reliably, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, as well as beating Alolan Muk. It also has access to Knock Off, which helps with Ghost-type Pokemon. Metagross's access to Bullet Punch allows it to break Mimikyu's Disguise in cases where Mimikyu manages to set up Swords Dance without losing the Disguise, and its powerful STAB Meteor Mash lets it ease the Fairy matchup drastically, with the help of Meloetta checking Mimikyu. Mew's access to a plethora of utility moves benefits Meloetta greatly. Will-O-Wisp lets Mew cripple physical offensive threats such as Mega Gallade and Mega Aerodactyl to make it up for Meloetta's low physical bulk. It also has Knock Off and Taunt to shut down status spreaders such as Toxapex and Chansey. Jirachi makes another decent partner for Meloetta; its access to Wish covers up Meloetta's lack of recovery. Jirachi also has U-turn, which lets it pivot for Meloetta. Jirachi's good defensive typing allows it to take on Bug-type attacks for Meloetta, and its part-Steel typing allows it to switch into Toxic safely. Moreover, Jirachi can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, making up for Meloetta's low Speed stat. Slowbro is an excellent physical wall that can take on many threats such as Excadrill and Terrakion thanks to its fantastic bulk, Regenerator, and Slack Off. Its Scald threatens physical attackers such as Terrakion and Excadrill with burns. Celebi functions similarly to Jirachi; its access to Thunder Wave cripples fast threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Gallade, its typing lets it switch into Ground-type attacks, and it can pivot for Meloetta with U-turn. Moreover, Celebi has Natural Cure which lets it absorb status conditions for Meloetta. Alakazam makes a decent backup for Meloetta. The combination of Focus Sash and Counter allows Alakazam to take on any physically offensive Pokemon one-on-one and beat them, including one of Meloetta's biggest counters, Alolan Muk. Latios has access to Defog, which removes entry hazards for its team, granting Meloetta some more freedom. Latios also has very good offensive stats, allowing it to act as a revenge killer with a Choice Scarf set. Victini has access to U-turn, which can be used to bring Meloetta into the field safely. Its good stats and strong offensive move options also let it be a good revenge killer with Choice Scarf.</p> "

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Greninja is the most versatile Water-type thanks to Protean giving it STAB on all of its attacks, enabling it to use almost any attack for coverage and still do great damage. It has an amazing movepool to maximize use of Protean including Ice Beam, Gunk Shot, Extrasensory, and many other coverage moves, which makes it a fantastic wallbreaker if it has the appropriate super effective attack. Expert Belt allows Greninja to take advantage of that fantastic coverage and ability Protean, allowing it to take on Flying, Water, and Ground teams quite easily. Greninja's amazing Speed makes it hard to revenge kill when it uses a Choice Scarf, able to outspeed almost the entire metagame, and allows Greninja to act as a great offensive pivot. In a completely different capacity, Greninja is also one of the few reliable ways to beat Poison teams for Water with its Groundium Z set. As a result of its many sets, Greninja is highly unpredictable and fits on almost every Water team, being able to fill any role the team needs. However, other than its Speed, Greninja has awful base stats, with almost no bulk to speak of and poor offensive stats. Furthermore, while its Speed is its only good stat, it still falls short of Tapu Koko, which is one of the biggest threats to Water teams, and can be easily revenge killed if it lacks Choice Scarf when considering its awful bulk. Greninja relies heavily on super effective damage to patch up its offensive stats, making it struggle to choose four moves from its huge movepool. Greninja will simply always be walled by something due to this restriction.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p>Greninja is one of the best offensive Pokemon that Dark teams have access to thanks to its powerful ability in Protean and to its diverse coverage options such as Gunk Shot, Ice Beam, U-turn, and Extrasensory making it an unpredictable threat. Protean also comes in handy defensively; for example, Greninja can become Psychic-type by using Extrasensory to avoid getting KOed by Keldeo's Secret Sword. Greninja sits at a splendid Speed tier, outspeeding common threats such as Garchomp, Mega Diancie, and non-Choice Scarf Keldeo. Greninja's use of an Expert Belt is complemented by its ability Protean, making it painful for many teams to deal with including Flying, Ground, and Water teams. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Greninja functions as a Dark team's revenge killer, outspeeding threats such as Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and other Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Bulu and Latios. Greninja has exploitable defensive stats, however, making it unable to take several hits and easy to revenge kill with priority attacks and faster attackers. Although Protean boosts attacks, Greninja is still held back by its average offensive stats, which means it's reliant on Life Orb to further boost its damage output. Greninja also lacks the room in its moveset to check every threat Dark teams might face.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>The Choice Scarf set can use Hydro Pump for its great damage output, but the coverage is disappointingly redundant with Ice Beam and coverage is far more important due to Protean. U-turn is also an option for Expert Belt Greninja to bluff Choice Scarf even more effectively, but it tends to be much worse than more useful coverage. Taunt is a utility option that can help Greninja deal with bulkier walls it otherwise needs to switch out against.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p>Grassium Z can be used in place of an Expert Belt in order to unleash a powerful Bloom Doom, which is capable of OHKOing some of Greninja's best checks such as Rotom-W and Suicune. However, this trade-off comes at the cost of an Expert Belt netting other important KOs; for example, Greninja fails to 2HKO Toxapex with Hidden Power Electric without Expert Belt. Extrasensory can be utilized as a means of breaking through Fighting- and Poison-types such as Kommo-o and Mega Venusaur, though it comes at the cost of one of Greninja's other, more important coverage moves. Spikes could be utilized over Toxic Spikes as an immediate way of dealing damage to the foe upon entry, but keep in mind that the poison damage granted through Toxic Spikes is generally better against Greninja's checks. Hydro Pump might be used over Toxic Spikes to give Dark teams a better chance against threatening foes such as Mega Steelix, but not having Toxic Spikes utility may make Greninja less of a threat. For the Choice Scarf set, Hidden Power Fire gives Greninja a reliable way of removing Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Low Kick allows Greninja to easily deal with threats such as Ferrothorn and Tyranitar. However, these coverage moves aren't as great as those in the main sets because its teammates often cover these matchups.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: No Greninja set can break Chansey, making it the best counter to Greninja. However, Greninja is capable of U-turning out of it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Most specially defensive walls that aren't weak to Gunk Shot or to the specific Greninja set's coverage can completely wall Greninja. Appropriate scouting for Greninja's moveset should be done to keep these checks safe.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Sets without Choice Scarf are very vulnerable to being outsped and revenge killed by a wide range of faster Pokemon including Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and most Choice Scarf users due to Greninja's poor bulk. Powerful priority such as Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed is also similarly capable of revenge killing Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis: Greninja tends to be incapable of outright OHKOing most Pokemon, so those that can survive a hit and paralyze it back, such as Jirachi, can cripple its Speed and prevent it from being a threat.</p> <h1>Dark</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey completely walls all of Greninja's attacks and can stall it out with Toxic + Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Celesteela and Alolan Muk can take repeated attacks. Celesteela can stall out Greninja with Leech Seed, while Alolan Muk can cripple Greninja with Knock Off and poison it with Poison Touch. Greninja also takes a great deal of damage from Pursuit after a change in type.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Suicune can easily tank Greninja's attacks. Gastrodon can use Toxic on Greninja, while Suicune can set up Calm Mind on it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Without a Choice Scarf, Greninja is outsped and KOed by revenge killers such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Bulu and Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Priority: With Greninja's low defenses and its variable typing due to Protean, it's easily revenge killed by Mach Punch Breloom, Extreme Speed Dragonite, and Bullet Punch Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Status and Entry Hazards: Greninja cannot afford to be inflicted with status, as paralysis completely ruins its impressive Speed and poison wears it down more quickly. Entry hazards are also problematic in limiting Greninja's opportunities to switch in and making it easier to revenge kill.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam hits Dragon-, Flying-, Ground-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Tornadus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu, all of which are very threatening for Water teams. Grass Knot nails Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Hidden Power Electric is coverage that allows Greninja to specifically target Mantine, which easily switches into its other attacks, while also hitting Toxapex hard. Extrasensory allows Greninja to hit Poison- and Fighting-type threats such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Keldeo, making Greninja a consistent answer to Poison teams when in combination with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment alongside a Timid nature allow Greninja to hit as fast and hard as possible. Protean allows Greninja to gain STAB on all of its moves attacks, making it an incredible all-out attacker. Expert Belt increases damage done by super effective attacks, giving it enough damage to 2HKO Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja has amazing coverage that it can easily take advantage of. Since it commonly runs Choice Scarf, it can spam one attack to bluff a Choice Scarf and lure in Pokemon that resist the coverage move it is pretending to be locked into. Greninja is amazing in the mirror matchup, as with its combined coverage of Grass Knot and Hidden Power Electric, it can easily hit every Water-type Pokemon super effectively, making it a dangerous threat late-game. The same thing goes for the Flying and Ground matchups, as its Ice- and Grass-type coverage can hit all Pokemon bar Excadrill and Mega Steelix for super effective damage in the Ground matchup. Greninja is frail and therefore weak to common priority attacks such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, so it should switch out to a teammate such as Toxapex to handle these attacks. Furthermore, it should switch out of offensive Pokemon that it can't OHKO such as Kyurem-B, since it is so frail that oftentimes they will be able to OHKO Greninja in return. Because of this, Greninja should only be brought in safely to avoid taking unnecessary damage. Additionally, while Greninja certainly does not appreciate the chip damage from being poisoned or burned, it should absolutely at all costs avoid paralysis, as it severely cripples its ability to act as a fast revenge killer and allows it to get OHKOed by slower threats such as Kommo-o.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex is a great defensive pivot that can switch into threats such as Mega Venusaur for Greninja and makes a solid wall thanks to Recover. Additionally, it provides Toxic Spikes support, chipping down Greninja's threats and allowing it to clean late-game more easily. Swampert and Mega Swampert provide Stealth Rock support and an Electric-type immunity. Swampert is a solid defensive tank that can switch into threats such as Tapu Koko and Terrakion for Greninja. Mega Swampert on the other hand is a more offensive option that is extremely threatening with rain, taking on Greninja's checks such as Tapu Koko and Volcarona with Earthquake and Waterfall. Keldeo and Greninja share similar checks and can help break each other's down. Keldeo can break bulky cores from types such as Normal and Flying with Calm Mind and Taunt or be a more offensive threat and just muscle through Pokemon such as Chansey with Choice Specs-boosted Secret Sword. It also takes on Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn that otherwise wall Greninja. Mega Sharpedo is a great late-game cleaner that appreciates Greninja's ability to weaken many of its checks such as Hippowdon and Celesteela, allowing it to clean more easily. It is also able to outspeed threats such as Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny for Greninja. Running Mega Sharpedo allows Greninja to run Extrasensory, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur that would otherwise wall it. Rotom-W and Mantine can clear entry hazards for Greninja as well as provide it with a Ground immunity. Rotom-W can provide a slow pivot with Volt Switch and cripple physical attackers such as Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp. On the other hand, Mantine is a solid special wall with access to Roost, allowing it to easily switch into attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Gyarados can support Greninja by taking on its checks such as Mega Venusaur and Chansey with boosted Supersonic Skystrike. In return, Greninja can break past physical walls for Gyarados such as Celesteela and Swampert. Additionally, it provides Greninja with a solid switch-in to Ground-type attacks. Thanks to rain and Choice Specs-boosted Hurricane, Pelipper is able to take on a plethora of Grass- and Poison-type Pokemon for Greninja such as Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Toxapex. Additionally, it can pivot in Greninja safely with U-turn, can clear hazards with Defog, and shares similar checks with Greninja, allowing them to both help break down the other's checks. Manaphy helps break down Poison-type threats to Greninja such as Alolan Muk and Mega Venusaur after one Tail Glow boost thanks to Surf and Psychic, respectively.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn provides switch momentum by allowing Greninja to pivot out of incoming walls into a teammate. Ice Beam gives Greninja a strong option to hit a wide range of threats including Dragon-types like Dragonite and Flying-types like Zapdos. Gunk Shot lets Greninja revenge kill Fairy-types, most importantly Tapu Koko, which is one of the most threatening Pokemon to Water teams. Defensively, it also provides Greninja with a Poison typing, making it a solid choice for 2HKOing Mega Charizard Y and Mega Diancie, both of which cannot OHKO a Poison-type Greninja with Solar Beam and Moonblast, respectively. Dark Pulse is a reliable STAB move that has fantastic coverage with Greninja's other moves and importantly hits Psychic-type walls like Mew, Jirachi, and Slowbro for a lot of damage. Depending on the user's team, Greninja's final moveslot can easily be replaced with more specific coverage moves to hit certain threats in exchange for losing out on the spammable Dark Pulse. For offensive teams that lack defensive switch-ins to these threats, Rock Slide is a solid coverage option that notably OHKOes Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y while 2HKOing Mantine and Kyurem-B. Low Kick is the only option that can OHKO Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage or two hits of Life Orb damage. It also 2HKOes Ferrothorn, almost always OHKOes Heatran, and always OHKOes Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire is useful for 2HKOing both Ferrothorn and Klefki, which often try to switch into Greninja, but it has no other useful targets. Entry hazards in the form of either Spikes or Toxic Spikes are also a viable final option on offensive teams to punish the opposing team's switches.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs, a Naive nature, and a Choice Scarf make Greninja as fast as possible, outspeeding almost the entire metagame including Adamant Sand Rush Excadrill and Swift Swim Kingdra. A Naive nature is important to use instead of Hasty to make sure Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed and other powerful priority are not able to KO Greninja. Greninja should use either 252 Special Attack or 252 Attack EVs depending on its fourth moveslot, as that slot typically relies heavily on investment to net the intended KOs. Protean changes Greninja's type to the typing of the move it uses, giving it permanent STAB and defensive flexibility.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja can serve as a fantastic lead thanks to its incredible Speed and use of U-turn to get switch advantage from the very beginning of the match, as almost no leads are capable of anti-leading Greninja. It is also a very reliable revenge killer, able to outspeed even many boosted sweepers. If Greninja isn't able to OHKO the threat, though, U-turn can be used to get chip damage at the cost of a teammate taking a hit. Greninja has rather poor damage output when lacking super effective coverage and can rarely touch walls, so if you predict one to switch into Greninja, U-turn should be used to preserve momentum. Once these walls are weakened, though, Greninja is more than capable of serving as a late-game sweeper with its STAB-boosted attacks. In most cases, try to use teammates such as Rotom-W to pivot into Greninja safely, as it can't take hits very well at all and should not switch into most attacks outside of those that are Psychic-type. However, when already in play, remember that Protean can be used defensively to give Greninja unusual resistances, such as using Gunk Shot against Mega Diancie's Moonblast or Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Greninja is best when paired with wallbreakers and stallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Kingdra, Perish Trap Azumarill, and Suicune that can take on the walls it can't touch. Greninja's ability to bait walls in and pivot on them with U-turn makes it an even better teammate for these Pokemon. Specifically, this set can't touch the Poison defensive core, so a Pokemon like Gyarados that can beat it is important to have. Other pivots such as Rotom-W are great for forming a VoltTurn core with Greninja, able to keep up momentum for each other or for other teammates. While Toxapex lacks a pivoting move, it is still a fantastic option due to its ability Regenerator. It also frequently uses Toxic Spikes, which is crucial for wearing down Greninja's checks to enable a late-game sweep. Pokemon such as Swampert are almost necessary for their Stealth Rock support, which further punishes the switches that Greninja can easily force. Because Greninja likes to switch in and out frequently, hazard control from the likes of Mantine and Empoleon for your side of the field is crucial to avoid letting it get worn down too quickly. Being almost unparalleled in Speed, Greninja is very useful for taking out opposing revenge killers for sweepers, such as Gyarados and Mega Sharpedo. Mega Sharpedo is notable in being able to check Psychic-types, meaning Greninja can more easily choose to use a different coverage option from Dark Pulse.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is used for its coverage, hitting Flying-, Grass-, and Dragon-types including Zapdos and Cradily super effectively and 2HKOing even Kyurem-B. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types and special walls such as Mantine hard, making Greninja a mixed attacking threat. Dark Pulse deals wallbreaking damage to Psychic-types, able to at least 2HKO almost every Psychic-type, while having decent spammability on even neutral targets. Greninja can choose from a wide range of options for its last move, selecting whatever its team needs most. Hidden Power Fire can OHKO many Steel-types including Ferrothorn, which tends to be a difficult Pokemon to break. Alternatively, Hidden Power Electric with Ice Beam 2HKOes almost every Flying-type other than Celesteela, making Greninja very difficult to check in that matchup. If these coverage combinations are unneeded, Hydro Pump is Greninja's strongest attack and can be used over Dark Pulse for wallbreaking, as it notably can 2HKO even specially defensive Mega Sableye, but Water-type coverage is relatively redundant with Ice Beam. If Hydro Pump is used, Rock Slide can be used alongside it because it OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and still breaks most Flying teams. Greninja can use Spikes or Toxic Spikes quite effectively, as it forces switches and can take that opportunity to set up entry hazards.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment into Special Attack and Speed and a Naive nature make Greninja as strong and as fast as possible. Protean makes Greninja deal significant damage with all of its attacks thanks to STAB. Life Orb gives Greninja great damage on all of its attacks at the cost of recoil damage. To avoid recoil damage, Expert Belt can be used instead and to bluff other sets, but Greninja's neutral damage is pitiful and Hydro Pump should not be used with it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set looks to come in as often as possible and fire off powerful super effective attacks whenever possible. As a result, try to pivot into it on double switches to Pokemon it outspeeds. It can also be used as a revenge killer with its good Speed, either KOing or forcing out threats like Mega Gallade that Water struggles with. Be careful with Greninja's health, as it has rather poor bulk and Life Orb will chip at Greninja over time. Avoid letting Greninja take hits it doesn't resist, as even neutral damage from weak walls can deal serious damage. Protean can be used for this purpose, giving Greninja unusual resistances to allow it to take hits it otherwise wouldn't be able to. Greninja has a huge range of moves it can viably use, so use that to your advantage, as your opponent will try hard to scout out your moveset. While Greninja's moves are unknown, it has a very easy time firing off attacks without fear. If Greninja uses Expert Belt, bluffing Choice Scarf or Groundium Z is a good strategy for netting surprise KOs.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Even though this is one of Greninja's more powerful sets, it still doesn't have particularly fantastic damage output, so pairing Greninja with a wallbreaker is a good idea to dismantle balance and defensive teams. Choice Specs Keldeo can be a great option for breaking the Normal defensive core, which Greninja has no way of touching. Swift Swim Kingdra can be a great anti-offense option, as it can revenge kill Pokemon like Tapu Koko that outspeed Greninja. Rain in general is useful if Greninja packs Hydro Pump, as rain-boosted Hydro Pump is the only way Greninja can 2HKO Celesteela. Be aware, though, that rain will make Greninja's Hidden Power Fire deal insignificant damage. On more balanced teams, Perish Trap Azumarill can be an unorthodox way of taking out walls for Greninja. Greninja benefits greatly from having its switch-ins chipped away at, so support such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes from Swampert and Toxapex is always appreciated. A way to beat the Poison defensive core is needed, so a specific check such as Flyinium Z Gyarados should be used for this purpose.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Poison Killer (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Extrasensory is the primary attack for this set, able to 2HKO almost every Pokemon on a Poison team including Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Dig completes the necessary coverage to allow this set to sweep Poison, as Tectonic Rage always OHKOes Alolan Muk, the only commonly used Poison-type that Extrasensory cannot touch. Ice Beam is used for its great coverage to give Greninja a strong, spammable move that no Pokemon is immune to. The final moveslot is used to complete coverage combinations to counter certain types, as this set lacks power if its moves are not super effective. With Tectonic Rage dealing crippling damage to Klefki, Gunk Shot is a great move that can pressure Fairy teams, although Greninja is still outsped by Tapu Koko. While it doesn't pair particularly well with Tectonic Rage, Hidden Power Electric forms the well-known BoltBeam coverage with Ice Beam and can 2HKO Mantine and Mega Charizard Y to break Flying teams. Hidden Power Fire can be used as well, as Heatran is OHKOed by Tectonic Rage, enabling Greninja to spam Hidden Power Fire safely against Steel teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment into Special Attack gives Greninja enough damage to 2HKO Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. 4 Attack EVs are used to guarantee the OHKO on Alolan Muk. A Naive nature and 252 Speed EVs make sure Greninja outspeeds Pokemon such as Latios, Gengar, Keldeo, and Mega Diancie. Protean gives Greninja's moves STAB, enabling it to deal enough damage to break the Poison teams it's built for. Groundium Z enables Greninja to use Tectonic Rage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Tectonic Rage only has one use, be very careful to not waste it needlessly. For Poison teams, Alolan Muk will often be baited in to Pursuit a Psychic-type Greninja, so it is generally safe to use it after it has switched in. Against Fairy teams, though, because Klefki will be able to set Prankster Reflect, it is necessary to hit it on the switch, so try to predict its switch in. Klefki will often try to switch into Gunk Shot, so luring it in by giving Greninja a free switch into Tapu Bulu or even Tapu Koko is relatively easy. In many matchups, Tectonic Rage can be a good surprise for hitting special walls as well. For example, Ground teams expecting Choice Scarf Ice Beam like to switch into Seismitoad on Greninja, and Tectonic Rage almost always OHKOes standard Seismitoad after it switches into Ice Beam. Because Greninja tends to not run Hydro Pump, Tectonic Rage is also typically good for hitting Pokemon like Heatran and Tyranitar that don't expect to take a huge amount of damage. Even though it may be dangerous, many expect Choice Scarf Greninja, so as long as you haven't revealed a teammate's Choice Scarf, it is very possible to bluff it to lure in one of Tectonic Rage's targets. Against Poison teams, it is also very possible to bluff other items too such as Expert Belt before Extrasensory is used. However, Extrasensory is not used outside of this set too often without Life Orb, so once Greninja has used Extrasensory and does not take Life Orb recoil, it is difficult to bluff another set. Due to Greninja's great movepool, it is difficult for your opponent to predict its coverage move. Try to preserve that deception as long as possible, especially if you haven't revealed Dig yet, as the wide range of moves Greninja can pack is part of its strength. Make sure to avoid taking unnecessary damage on Greninja, as it lacks a damage-boosting item and may need to take a hit or two to break walls. As a result, it is best to pair this set with a pivot that can bring Greninja in safely, such as U-turn Pelipper. Ground is a very unusual typing for Greninja to access with Protean, so use that to your advantage against Electric-types that expect to be able to fire off an attack safely. Even though Dig is a two-turn move, it still has utility for this purpose.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water teams generally have a very rough time beating the Poison defensive core, so almost any team that lacks an alternative solution can use this set. Rain teams in particular appreciate Greninja's support. However, rain weakens Greninja's Hidden Power Fire, so that coverage move should not be used on rain teams. Pelipper can use a slow U-turn to effectively get Greninja into play safely while also packing Defog to protect Greninja from Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards. Rotom-W is capable of fulfilling a similar role to Pelipper on non-rain teams. Sweepers such as Swift Swim Kingdra, Mega Gyarados, and Suicune all appreciate Greninja removing their Poison-type checks. This set lacks power when not battling its specific targets, so wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Azumarill, can help break walls for Greninja. Hazard support from Swampert and Toxapex can be helpful for putting Pokemon such as Crobat into range of being OHKOed to alleviate the damage output issue. This set lacks the Speed of Choice Scarf, so it's important to have a teammate like Choice Scarf Keldeo that can help revenge kill Pokemon that can force out Greninja.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Beam is a strong coverage option that can be used to take down various offensive and defensive threats alike, such as Latios, Tapu Bulu, Gliscor, and Zapdos. Hidden Power Electric is used against bulky Flying- and Water-types such as Celesteela, Mantine, and Toxapex. Grass Knot is used against specific foes such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad, as they can comfortably take on Greninja's other attacks by virtue of ability and typing. Toxic Spikes is great for residual damage against most foes, and the increasing poison damage helps combat most of Greninja's checks such as Chansey and Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment coupled with a Timid nature allows Greninja to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Expert Belt strengthens the power of its moves whenever they are super effective, which can be important in some cases. For example, Expert Belt-boosted Hidden Power Electric allows Greninja to 2HKO Toxapex. Protean blesses Greninja with the ability to change its typing depending on the move it uses, granting it STAB on all of its moves in the process and thus giving it an incredible offensive presence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja should utilize this set to lure in and remove would-be checks such as Mantine and Toxapex, as its wide movepool and variety of sets makes it very unpredictable. Greninja also should use one move at a time to bluff a potential Choice Scarf set, as it makes luring in foes such as Celesteela and Mantine much more effective, as well as threaten would-be checks such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko out. However, it should still avoid special walls such as Chansey and Ferrothorn, as their incredible special bulk can let them comfortably take any attack it can dish out. Greninja should be conserved as much as possible against Flying, Ground, and Water teams, as its incredible coverage serves as an invaluable asset against them. It shouldn't be immediately switched into attacks, as it's incredibly frail. It should also avoid paralysis, as Greninja relies on its high Speed in order to threaten fast foes such as Mega Diancie and Latios. Greninja should also avoid chip damage from entry hazards and status, as it needs to be as healthy as possible in order to effectively threaten foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye can use its typing and well rounded defenses to comfortably handle Greninja's checks, such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Mega Gallade, while also providing a critical Fighting-type immunity. Additionally, Mega Sableye can prevent entry hazards that would chip away at Greninja's health from being set through Magic Bounce. Mandibuzz assists Greninja through its various potential utility moves, including Defog, Taunt, and U-turn. It can also use its high Defense and Ground-type immunity to switch into foes such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Band Excadrill in sand for Greninja. Tyranitar's acts as a strong special wall and supporter under sand, being able to stomach attacks from foes such as Latios and Tapu Koko for Greninja while also providing Stealth Rock support for it. It can also act as a setup sweeper with its combination of Dragon Dance, strong physical moves, and Rockium Z to break down special walls such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur. Alternatively, Mega Tyranitar can also perform the same role as base Tyranitar, exchanging Rockium Z for much better stats and a better Speed tier for outspeeding foes that base Tyranitar wouldn't be able to with one Dragon Dance boost, such as Tapu Koko and Weavile. Alolan Muk can use its typing and high Special Defense to sponge special attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam for Greninja. Additionally, its access to Knock Off means that it can weaken foes such as Porygon2 and Toxapex, making it easier for Greninja to remove them. Krookodile serves as a solid lead for Greninja, being able to set up Stealth Rock and prevent slower foes from setting their own entry hazards with Taunt. Additionally, Choice Scarf variants can be run to outspeed and revenge kill foes such as Tapu Koko. Hydreigon can stallbreak foes that Greninja has trouble with, such as Chansey and Steel-types such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Additionally, it can utilize Dragonium Z to devastate slower, bulkier Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Rotom-W.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gunk Shot is necessary for Greninja to check Fairy-types, and it making Greninja Poison-type has some use in avoiding Toxic and resisting Grass. U-turn helps maintain momentum and take advantage of forced switches such as Landorus fearing Ice Beam. Ice Beam lets Greninja hit annoying Flying-types such as Zapdos as well as Dragon- and Ground-types such as Hydreigon and Landorus. Hydro Pump targets threats such as Excadrill and Heatran, 2HKOes Klefki, and does slightly more damage than Gunk Shot to +1 Volcarona. Spikes is a great utility move, and with Greninja's offensive presence and coverage moves forcing so many switches, it's able to get set up, applying pressure on grounded Pokemon. Rock Slide is a reliable move for KOing threats that are really weak to it such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Naive nature and a Choice Scarf make Greninja as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Bulu, Latios, Adamant Excadrill in sand, and Modest Kingdra in rain. A Naive nature alongside 4 Attack EVs keeps Greninja from weakening Gunk Shot. 252 Special Attack EVs maximizes Greninja's damage output. Protean is the ability of choice to change Greninja's typing and gain STAB from it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Greninja takes on the role of a revenge killer, outspeeding and taking on threats such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and slower Choice Scarf users. Greninja can also utilize its high Speed to clean late-game, and it can be an effective lead thanks to U-turn and how many Pokemon it forces out. Greninja should try setting up Spikes early-game to begin putting pressure on teams. It needs to come in safely from a slow U-turn user such as Mandibuzz or a fainted teammate because of its frailty. Make sure to take advantage of U-turn so Greninja can escape any possible disadvantages it may encounter. Be careful about what Greninja is locked into, since getting forced out or becoming setup fodder for Pokemon like Terrakion is a momentum drain; it's best to make sure that all of Greninja's checks and counters are gone or weakened so it can sweep late-game. Be aware that even with Protean, Greninja doesn't hit as hard with Choice Scarf; bulky threats will be able to switch in comfortably, so avoid having Greninja take them on. Greninja should avoid paralysis at all costs, as its role as a revenge killer will be ruined.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar is an excellent teammate, as it can help wallbreak early- or mid-game and dismantle teams for Greninja to clean late-game. Tyranitar and Krookodile provide Stealth Rock support for Greninja to KO threats more easily. Tyranitar can also paralyze foes with Thunder Wave and tank special attacks, whereas Krookodile can switch into Electric-type moves, supply utility with Knock Off, and revenge kill threats thanks to its Focus Sash. Intimidate from Krookodile can also assist in softening physical attacks for Greninja. Other Knock Off users such as Mega Sableye, Bisharp, and Alolan Muk cripple item-reliant Pokemon, especially Eviolite and Leftovers users such as Porygon2 and Zapdos. Mega Sableye can block status moves, while Bisharp and Alolan Muk can be additional checks to Fairy-types. Mandibuzz can switch into physical attackers for Greninja and punish Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Dragonite with Foul Play. Since Greninja will be pivoting out often with U-turn, it also benefits from Mandibuzz's Defog. Hydreigon can wallbreak for Greninja thanks to Choice Specs and switch into Ground-type attacks. Mega Sharpedo and Greninja can help one another clean up late-game, and Mega Sharpedo can use Psychic Fangs to pressure Fighting-types. Cacturne is a great check to problematic Water-types such as Suicune and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Greninja's strongest move for hitting threats such as Mega Diancie, Heatran, and Excadrill. Ice Beam is great for taking care of Dragon- and Flying-types such as Mega Altaria, Gliscor, and Zapdos. Gunk Shot gives Greninja coverage for Fairy-types such as Clefable, notably OHKOing Azumarill. Extrasensory hits Fighting- and Poison-types that threaten Dark teams such as Keldeo, Mega Venusaur, and Toxapex.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Naive nature allow Greninja to be as fast as possible, outspeeding anything under base 122 Speed with the exception of Choice Scarf users. A Naive nature also keeps Gunk Shot from being weakened. Maximum Special Attack investment grants Greninja more attacking power. Protean is necessary for Greninja to have STAB on all of its attacks. Greninja can't do a lot of damage without a boosting item, so Life Orb is the item of choice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Greninja is generally frail, it should switch in for free or on weak, resisted attacks. It can also attempt to come in from a double switch. Greninja's terrifying coverage and decent offensive stats are just enough for it to force switches, so capitalize on that by immediately switching to a teammate that's able to take on the opposing team's check to Greninja. Make sure to save Greninja for fast threats that it'll be able to revenge kill such as Life Orb Latios and Gengar. It's always best to keep Greninja away from revenge killers and Choice Scarf users because Greninja is often needed in later parts of the match thanks to its wide coverage. Remember that Protean can be used to your defensive advantage; for example, Greninja will resist Moonblast after using Gunk Shot. Make sure to keep Greninja away from paralysis, burns, and poison, which will ruin its Speed or longevity.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Greninja doesn't appreciate being worn down by entry hazards, so Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz make for good partners. Mega Sableye also offers protection from Thunder Wave, Toxic, Knock Off, and Fighting-type attacks. Mandibuzz, on the other hand, can get Greninja in safely with its slow U-turn and tank attacks with its physical bulk. Mega Tyranitar can assist Greninja in pressuring teams. With Greninja taking on physically defensive threats, Mega Tyranitar gets rid of special walls such as Chansey. Specially defensive Tyranitar can switch into special attacks for Greninja and provide Thunder Wave support so Greninja can outspeed even Choice Scarf users. Mega Sharpedo can help clean up late-game after Greninja has dealt enough damage to the opposing team. Hydreigon and Greninja together are great in at pressuring teams. Hydreigon can specifically take out Steel-types such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is also a valuable teammate, revenge killing threats Greninja has weakened. Bisharp and Alolan Muk help Greninja take on annoying Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Azumarill, and both can provide Knock Off support. Bisharp specifically can check Ice-types, while Alolan Muk can switch into special attacks. Krookodile is another good Stealth Rock and Knock Off user that is also able to check Electric-types for Greninja. Cacturne can check bulky Water-types like Suicune and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill, which would otherwise give Greninja trouble.</p> "

  "Diggersby": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Diggersby is one of the best physical wallbreakers in the metagame thanks to Huge Power along with its access to great STAB attacks, coverage in Fire Punch, and priority in Quick Attack. It is able to form an amazing offensive core when paired with a teammate such as Mega Lopunny or Mega Pidgeot, as it is able to wallbreak while its partner deals with its faster checks. However, due to common Pokemon having an immunity or resistance to Diggersby's STAB moves, Diggersby relies heavily on prediction in order to get past common defensive cores that are immune to its attacks such as Mega Sableye with Mandibuzz and Skarmory with Heatran. Incorrect predictions in matchups such as Dark and Steel can heavily impede the team's momentum, as Diggersby will be forced to switch out. Swords Dance turns Diggersby into a phenomenal setup sweeper and wallbreaker able to OHKO many walls such as Mandibuzz and Mega Venusaur and removes its need for accurate predictions. Its low Speed also leaves much to be desired; while it outspeeds the majority of defensive Pokemon, it is vulnerable to faster attackers such as Infernape, Landorus, and Tapu Bulu. Diggersby's typing and middling bulk leave it vulnerable to a large number of attacks, most notably Ice-, Water-, and Grass-type moves, as well as common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Mach Punch. However, its Ground typing provides a key immunity to Electric, preventing foes such as Zapdos from gaining momentum through Volt Switch. Lastly, Diggersby is very reliant on its item to maintain its ability to work as a wallbreaker and should avoid switching into common Knock Off users such as Armaldo and Gliscor.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>Diggersby has no viable other options.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Keldeo, and Nidoking all threaten to OHKO Diggersby with super effective coverage when out of range of Diggersby's Quick Attack and force it to switch out when it is locked into non-priority attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Physical walls such as Porygon2 and Mega Slowbro are able to absorb hits from Diggersby and heal off any damage dealt to them. Skarmory also notably forces Diggersby to lock itself into Fire Punch, which the opponent can easily take advantage of by switching into Pokemon such as Heatran and Mantine.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Due to Diggersby's typing and mediocre bulk, it is weak to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet from Azumarill and Mach Punch from Breloom when it is locked into a non-priority move.</p> <p><strong>Burn: Diggersby cannot wallbreak effectively if it is burned.

        "name": "Physical Wallbreaker (Normal)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return is Diggersby's most powerful and reliable attack, as it is able to hit the majority of Pokemon neutrally. Earthquake is a great Ground-type STAB attack, allowing Diggersby to hit Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-types, which are not covered by Return. Fire Punch is necessary for Diggersby to be able to hit Steel-types that are immune to Ground such as Skarmory and Celesteela. Quick Attack is a great priority attack that makes up for Diggersby's mediocre Speed, allowing it to revenge kill weakened foes such as Victini and Thundurus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature and a Choice Band allows Diggersby to be as powerful as possible and act as a great wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment allows Diggersby to outspeed threatening Pokemon such as Jolly Scizor and Adamant Bisharp as well as most defensively oriented Pokemon. A Jolly nature can be utilized instead of Adamant to outspeed Pokemon such as Heatran and Mega Scizor, easing the matchup against Steel. 4 Special Defense EVs give Diggersby a higher Special Defense stat than Defense, which prevents Download Pokemon such as Porygon2 from receiving a Special Attack boost. Huge Power doubles Diggersby's Attack, which causes it to be a fearsome wallbreaker that can 2HKO even the toughest physical walls. Life Orb could be utilized over Choice Band to grant Diggersby the ability to switch moves, easing the need for accurate predictions and allowing it to blast through types such as Poison, Steel, and Flying. However, it loses out on the overwhelming power that Choice Band provides and quickly wears Diggersby down.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Diggersby should primarily be used early-game to break walls such as Clefable and Chansey to pave the way for teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Pidgeot. Due to Diggersby's heavy reliance on prediction, be wary of Pokemon such as Protect Mega Sableye, Protect Ferrothorn, and Baneful Bunker Toxapex, as they're able to scout which attack Diggersby is locked into and then switch to a teammate that can deal with whichever move is chosen. Utilize Quick Attack to revenge weakened but faster foes such as Victini and Keldeo; however, be wary of locking Diggersby into Quick Attack, as it opens up opportunities for your opponent to safely bring in threatening setup Pokemon such as Azumarill. Due to Diggersby's mediocre bulk, avoid switching it in on attacks and entry hazards if possible in order to preserve its HP throughout the battle. Avoid common Will-O-Wisp and Scald users such as Mega Sableye and Gastrodon unless they're weakened to the point that Diggersby can KO them, as Diggersby's wallbreaking ability is ruined if it gets burned. Take advantage of Diggersby's Ground typing to block Electric-type attacks, most notably to prevent opposing Pokemon such as Zapdos from gaining momentum through Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Porygon2 and Chansey form an amazing defensive core that can deal with threats to Diggersby such as Greninja and Kyurem-B. They are also able to spread status such as paralysis to nullify faster attackers such as Keldeo and Greninja and poison to whittle down defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz for Diggersby, allowing it to further act as a wallbreaker and cleaner. Chansey notably sets Stealth Rock, which whittles down foes to ease Diggersby's wallbreaking attempts. Staraptor is a great defensive Pokemon that can absorb Fighting-type attacks and remove entry hazards for Diggersby. It can also act as a pivot with U-turn to safely bring Diggersby into the field. Mega Lopunny forms a physically offensive core with Diggersby that can break past most defensive cores. It is also able to deal with physical walls such as Toxapex thanks to Encore and Power-Up Punch. Mega Pidgeot acts as a powerful special attacker that is able to deal with physically defensive Pokemon that Diggersby has trouble with such as Skarmory as well as offensive Pokemon that outspeed Diggersby such as Keldeo and Mega Gallade. It can also utilize U-turn to bring Diggersby in to break special walls. Porygon-Z is a powerful special setup sweeper that can clean through teams after its common specially defensive checks such as Chansey and Alolan Muk have been eliminated by Diggersby. Ditto is one of the best Choice Scarf users on Normal; it is able to eliminate faster threats to Diggersby such as Terrakion and Garchomp and dissuade sweepers such as Volcarona and Mega Gallade from setting up. Smeargle provides both Sticky Web and Stealth Rock support for Diggersby on hyper offense, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon that otherwise are faster than it such as Kyurem-B and Choice Band Victini. It is also able to put foes to sleep with Spore and paralyze foes with Nuzzle, giving Diggersby more opportunities to break past opposing Pokemon.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance (Normal)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance turns Diggersby into a threatening wallbreaker and lets it pick up important KOs such as a guaranteed OHKO on Mandibuzz and Mega Venusaur with +2 Breakneck Blitz. Return is Diggersby's main STAB attack and its most reliable attack. Earthquake allows Diggersby to hit Steel-, Poison-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Tyranitar for super effective damage while also preventing Diggersby from being walled by Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye. Quick Attack provides Diggersby with a form of priority, allowing it to revenge kill faster threats such as Greninja once they are weakened.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack and 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Diggersby hit as hard as possible, notably outspeeding threats such as Heatran and Mega Heracross. Huge Power doubles Diggersby's attack, making it a phenomenal physical wallbreaker. Normalium Z turns Diggersby's Return into Breakneck Blitz, which allows it to take on Pokemon such as Mandibuzz after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Diggersby should find appropriate times to set up Swords Dance, since its bulk is rather limited, optimally against a forced switch or defensive Pokemon that can't do much in return such as Chansey. It is important to time when to use Breakneck Blitz, as it should be used when it is guaranteed to pick up a KO or take out walls Diggersby would otherwise not be able to overcome such as Mega Venusaur. Diggersby can also act as a fantastic revenge killer thanks to Quick Attack. Once its checks, such as Greninja, have been weakened into Quick Attack range, it should set up a Swords Dance and proceed to sweep through the opposing team. This Diggersby set can bluff Choice Band as a means to force Pokemon out or make them scout Diggersby's move with Protect, giving it a free turn to set up. This is invaluable in matchups such as Poison, where Baneful Bunker Toxapex is forced to scout Diggersby, giving it time to set up and then wreak havoc on the team. It should save its boosted Breakneck Blitz for Mega Venusaur in Poison matchups, which can't be taken out by any other +2 attack. Like every other setup sweeper, Diggersby does not appreciate status and should try to avoid it at all costs.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Lopunny appreciates Diggersby's ability to take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur that it has trouble breaking past and in return can lock walls such as Mandibuzz into their recovery moves with Encore, giving Diggersby a free switch in. Chansey is a great special wall that can take on threats to Diggersby such as Latios and Greninja while being able to cripple foes with Thunder Wave or Toxic or set up Stealth Rock, chipping Diggersby's checks. Porygon2 is a great physical wall that Diggersby can rely on to beat powerful attackers such as Choice Band Excadrill. Porygon2 also can take on troublesome Flying-type Pokemon such as Celesteela with Discharge and Gliscor with Ice Beam. Staraptor clears entry hazards for Diggersby, allowing it to avoid hazards such as Toxic Spikes, which severely hinder its ability to act as a setup sweeper. It also acts as a Fighting-type check with Intimidate and Brave Bird, taking on Pokemon such as Mega Gallade. Ditto is a fantastic revenge killer, being able to take on any threat that threatens Diggersby such as Mega Lopunny or Zeraora. Mega Pidgeot is another option for a Mega Pokemon, albeit not as good as Mega Lopunny, that can check Fighting- and Steel-type Pokemon for Diggersby such as Keldeo and Celesteela with Hurricane and Heat Wave respectively. It can also bring in Diggersby with U-turn. Smeargle is also an option for hyper offensive Normal teams and provides Sticky Web support, allowing Diggersby to outspeed threats such as Keldeo.</p> "

This allows Talonflame to either break down a team early-game or clean up late-game.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Having a Pokemon with entry hazard removal is absolutely crucial. Torkoal is a great defensive pivot that fits perfectly in this. Torkoal can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and can even set up its own Stealth Rock to break Focus Sash and Sturdy for Talonflame. Torkoal also sets up Drought to weaken Water-type moves for Talonflame and overwrites other weather, which may chip away at Talonflame. Torkoal can run Yawn and put a Pokemon to sleep to let Talonflame set up easier.</li> <li>Heatran is another Stealth Rock user that Talonflame greatly appreciates. Heatran can run Earth Power or Flash Cannon to remove Rock-type Pokemon that wall Talonflame. In return, Talonflame can get rid of Fighting-types for it. Heatran can also run a Bloom Doom set with to beat bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Swampert that wall Talonflame. Another reason why these two work great together is because Heatran can bait in Choice Scarf users like Terrakion and lock them into a Ground-type move. This creates an opportunity to set up for Talonflame.</li> <li>Mega Charizard Y can also run Defog to clear away Stealth Rock. Like Torkoal, Mega Charizard Y sets up Drought for Talonflame and weakens Water-type moves. It can also run Solar Beam to get rid of Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon.</li> <li>Mega Charizard X appreciates Talonflame's ability to cripple a team with Will-O-Wisp or by setting up. This allows Mega Charizard X to clean up or vice versa.</li> <li>Infernape can run a Stealth Rock set to cripple opposing Pokemon and a Taunt set to stop Stealth Rock from being set up. It can also run a wallbreaker set with Choice Band to beat Rock-types for Talonflame.

    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Dragalge has a niche on Dragon teams because of its access to Toxic Spikes, which benefits Dragon teams in bad matchups such as Fairy and Normal. Its Poison typing, amazing Special Attack, and ability Adaptability further enable it to pressure Fairy-types with Sludge Wave and OHKO Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock damage. Furthermore, Dragalge can take care of special Bug- and Fighting-type attacks from Volcarona and Gengar for Latios and Hydreigon that would otherwise OHKO them. Dragalge also has decent Special Defense that allows it to take on attacks from the likes of Keldeo and Nihilego and attack back with its STAB moves. However, while Dragalge is able to tank a few Fairy-type attacks, it struggles with taking repeated physical attacks from the likes of Victini, Mega Sharpedo, and Mega Scizor because of its low Defense. Dragalge's below average Speed also causes it to often move last before attacking, thus taking damage before it gets a chance to do so most of the time. Furthermore, its additional weaknesses to Psychic and Ground mean that it will be useless in these matchups, as it gets outpaced and OHKOed by most Pokemon that are common on these types. It also has trouble finding a slot on Dragon teams due to competition from better special attackers that have more Speed and are more useful in other matchups like Kommo-o and Hydreigon, for example.</p> ",

Sludge Wave allows Dragalge to pressure most Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie also and gives it a spammable attack in most matchups. Toxic Spikes is needed to help pressure bulkier teams like Normal and Water, as it stops walls like Chansey and Porygon2 from staying in too long. Hidden Power Fire is used for hitting Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, as both Pokemon either are immune to or resist both of Dragalge's STAB moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>224 HP and 4 Special Defense EVs are used to make Dragalge as bulky as possible to be able to tank Fairy-type moves like Choice Specs Tapu Koko's Dazzling Gleam and Mega Diancie's Moonblast. 252 Special Attack EVs with the ability Adaptability make Dragalge's STAB moves hit Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mega Diancie as hard as possible. 28 Speed EVs allow Dragalge to outpace Hippowdon and do a good amount of damage to it. Poison Barb is important to make Sludge Wave hit Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Diancie as hard as possible in order to OHKO them.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Dragalge in the Normal and Water matchups, as Toxic Spikes can wear down walls like Porygon2 and Swampert. This forces Toxapex or Mantine to come out and remove the hazards from the field because their teammates hate being inflicted by poison and Toxic. Dragalge forcing switches from the likes of Mega Diancie and Araquanid in the Fairy and Bug matchups makes a perfect time to set up Toxic Spikes to help wear them down; however, be careful around physical attackers like Victini, Terrakion, and Tapu Bulu as Dragalge cannot take their attacks well and has to switch to a teammate like Garchomp to take the attack. Switch in Dragalge when common Toxic users like Zapdos and Toxapex are on the field, as Dragalge is immune to it. Thanks to its Poison typing, Dragalge can also get rid of Toxic Spikes for its teammates, which they appreciate. Be careful about setting up Toxic Spikes around Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, as they will bounce Toxic Spikes onto your side of the field. Dragalge is also a good wallbreaker thanks to its ability Adaptability and Poison Barb, which allows it to take care of walls like Porygon2 and Zapdos. It is also able to pressure Fairy-types because of its strong Sludge Wave, and be a good neutral option in a neutral matchup due to its raw power. Use Draco Meteor against walls like Hippowdon and Mega Sableye once they are damaged or when Dragalge's health is too low for it to come back in. Use Dragalge as a lead in the Fairy matchup, as its Poison typing threatens most Fairy-types and can force switches. Dragalge can take advantage of this and set up Toxic Spikes rather than attacking; however, when trying to set Toxic Spikes, be careful if Mega Diancie has Mega Evolved, as entry hazards will be bounced to your side of the field because of its ability Magic Bounce. It is also wise to try to conserve Dragalge as much as possible, as it has an easier time setting up Toxic Spikes and using Sludge Wave once Mega Diancie is gone. In the Normal matchup, having Toxic Spikes on the field helps to wear down Mega Lopunny and walls like Chansey and Porygon2. Dragalge can set Toxic Spikes on passive Pokemon like Chansey and Porygon2 thanks to its Special Defense. However, be careful about using Toxic Spikes against Mega Lopunny and Diggersby because Dragalge cannot take attacks from them well.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Latias appreciates Dragalge's Toxic Spikes, as walls like Chansey and Porygon2 will be forced out before too long, while Mega Lopunny cannot keep using Encore, which gives Mega Latias an easier time with setting up. In return, Dragalge can also OHKO Mega Diancie with Sludge Wave, which helps with setting up Mega Latias in the Fairy matchup. Similarly, Mega Altaria appreciates Dragalge's Toxic Spikes support, putting pressure on bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Porygon2 and giving it an easier time to set up and sweep in both the Normal and Fairy matchups, as well as Dragalge taking care of Mega Diancie for it. Mega Altaria also helps greatly in the Dark matchup by taking care of Mega Sableye to make it easier to keep Toxic Spikes up. Garchomp is the only viable Stealth Rock user that Dragon teams have access to; fortunately, Stealth Rock pairs well with Dragalge's Toxic Spikes, as it helps with taking out Swampert and Greninja on Water teams and Staraptor on Normal teams so Toxic Spikes can stay up. Garchomp can also take on Steel-types that Dragalge struggles with like Heatran and Excadrill. Kommo-o helps greatly in the Steel and Poison matchups, as Taunt stops Celesteela and Ferrothorn from using Leech Seed, as well as helping with Pokemon that Dragalge struggles with like Excadrill, Nidoking, Toxapex, and Ice-types like Mamoswine because of its Fighting typing. Kommo-o can boost all its stats with Clangorous Soulblaze to take care of most Steel-types like Excadrill and Skarmory with Drain Punch and Flamethrower, but it struggles against Celesteela and Calm Mind Jirachi. Kyurem-B helps greatly in the Flying matchup, as Dragalge cannot do much because of everything outpacing it as well as Mantine soaking up its attacks. With Fusion Bolt and Ice Beam, Kyurem-B can take care of Mantine and Celesteela as well as troubling Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Kyurem-B can also switch into Greninja, as it can take an Ice Beam and either Roost the damage off or KO it with Fusion Bolt. Choice Scarf Latios is a great revenge killer for Dragon teams, as it gives a way to deal with fast Fighting-types like Keldeo and deals with threatening setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Cloyster after they set up once. It is also useful as a Defogger, as it remove hazards that could stop Dragalge from tanking an attack and putting out one layer of Toxic Spikes. Dragonite is very useful for Dragon teams, as its Extreme Speed helps deal with Greninja, one of the biggest threats to Dragon teams, as well as being a powerful wallbreaker to break walls like Celesteela, Chansey, and Toxapex with Fire Punch, Superpower, and Outrage, respectively.</p> "

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sylveon is a decent pick on Fairy teams thanks to its amazing wallbreaking capabilities with its Pixilate ability, good base 110 Special Attack, and Choice Specs. Furthermore, good special bulk allows it to fire off Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voices with ease against special attackers, and good coverage options such as Psyshock allow Sylveon to deal massive damage to types that would usually annoy Fairy, such as Poison. However, Sylveon's low Defense and Speed stats make it vulnerable to physical attackers and revenge killers and unable to outspeed key threats. Sylveon's mono-Fairy typing compounds this by adding nothing defensively to Fairy teams, and Sylveon cannot switch into common threats to Fairy. Sylveon is also very vulnerable to residual damage and is worn down very fast, making it susceptible to revenge killers. Lastly, while it has good coverage options, Sylveon lacks a way to heavily damage most Steel-types outside of Hidden Power, which is a crippling trait for a Fairy-type. All of these traits make Sylveon generally hard to fit on a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sylveon has nearly no other viable options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is Sylveon's best counter and is able to take all of Sylveon's attacks easily and recover the damage off. Sylveon cannot do much damage to Chansey before it is worn down with a combination of Toxic and Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Very specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey fear nearly nothing from Sylveon's attacks and can easily switch into it. They can then status it, pivot out, Defog for free, set up entry hazards, or hit Sylveon super effectively, depending on the Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ground can deal considerable damage to some Steel-types, Sylveon cannot run both at the same time. Thus, without one or the other, Sylveon becomes walled by Heatran (without Hidden Power Ground) or Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn (without Hidden Power Fire). Also, if a Steel-type switches in on a predicted Hyper Voice, it can easily OHKO Sylveon with its super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Strong physical attackers like Gyarados and even Mega Medicham can do considerable damage to Sylveon due to its low Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Fast, offensive Poison-types like Gengar and Nidoking can take a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice and retaliate with their super effective STAB attacks. However, they have to be wary of switching into Psyshock. Bulkier Poison-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex cannot switch into Psyshock, but they still check Sylveon due to their high defenses and Poison typing. In particular, Assault Vest Alolan Muk can switch into both Psyshock and Hyper Voice easily and threaten Sylveon with Poison Jab or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast revenge killers, especially physical ones like Garchomp, can be brought in after Sylveon achieves a KO and scare it out. Due to Sylveon's low Speed and Defense stats, it is easy to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y resist Hyper Voice and can take several of them. Fairy teams also often lack Fire-resistant Pokemon outside of Azumarill and Tapu Fini, and even then, Solar Beam is present on every Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Residual damage in the form of status or entry hazards wears down Sylveon and makes it much more vulnerable to a revenge kill. Sylveon also has no method of recovery outside of Wish support from teammates, so it is very susceptible to all forms of residual damage.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice turns into a Fairy-type 108-Base Power STAB move when boosted by Pixilate and is Sylveon's primary and most spammable attack. As it is a sound-based move, it also hits through Substitute, which can be useful for hitting Pokemon like Buzzwole and Keldeo. Hidden Power Fire deals solid damage to most Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, but it leaves Sylveon completely walled by Heatran. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative that can be used to KO Heatran while still hitting most Steel-types for super effective damage. However, it leaves Sylveon as setup fodder for Pokemon such as Mega Scizor. Psyshock hits Poison-type Pokemon, which threaten Fairy teams, super effectively. Notably, it 2HKOes Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, which Fairy teams have a hard time dealing with, after either Stealth Rock or Spikes damage. Shadow Ball hits opposing Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Jirachi and Alolan Marowak super effectively, but it should only be used if the foe resists Hyper Voice, as neutral Hyper Voice does more damage than even super effective Shadow Ball.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature and Choice Specs maximize Sylveon's power, letting it break through opposing Pokemon as easily as possible. 12 Speed EVs let Sylveon outspeed uninvested Tyranitar and base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Clefable. The rest of the EVs are put into HP and Defense, giving Sylveon more bulk. Pixilate turns Sylveon's Normal-type moves into Fairy-type ones while giving them a 20% boost, allowing it to wallbreak effectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is helpful to bring Sylveon in via a pivoting move such as Volt Switch, as it dislikes taking unnecessary damage. Similarly, it is also useful to bring in Sylveon after a teammate has been KOed. Locking Sylveon into Hyper Voice is usually the best option, as it has the most power and can be used repeatedly to wallbreak; avoid locking Sylveon into a move that a foe would then be able to exploit, such as Hidden Power Fire against a resistant foe, allowing them to either KO Sylveon or set up freely. Sylveon should be utilized early-game to deal massive damage to many Pokemon, making it easier for teammates like Azumarill to sweep late-game. Attempt to switch Sylveon into weaker special attackers like Pelipper and proceed to fire off free Hyper Voices. Use Sylveon's coverage moves on a predicted switch; for example, use Psyshock or Shadow Ball if you predict that Gengar will switch in. You should also avoid letting Sylveon get inflicted by status, as burns and poison limit its longevity and make it prone to being revenge killed, while paralysis halves its Speed and makes it easy to take out. Play Sylveon carefully around physical attackers, as its low Defense means that it has a harder time taking physical attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magic Guard Clefable can absorb status for Sylveon, set up Stealth Rock, and paralyze foes with Thunder Wave, making Sylveon's job much easier. Defog support from either Tapu Fini or Togekiss is appreciated, as taking entry hazard damage makes Sylveon much easier to revenge kill. Setup sweepers like Z-Belly Drum Azumarill appreciate Sylveon breaking down physical walls early-game, facilitating a late-game sweep. Choice Band or Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu also appreciates this, as it can clean up later after its checks have been worn down. Tapu Bulu can also break special walls like Chansey, which Sylveon has trouble against. Tapu Koko is a hard-hitting special attacker that can pivot into Sylveon while also wearing down their shared checks. Mega Diancie can also fulfill a similar role as a mixed wallbreaker that can take out Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Klefki can set up dual screens, reducing the damage done to Sylveon and allowing it to fire off its attacks more safely. Klefki also sports an immunity to Toxic and Poison-type attacks, making it a good switch-in when Sylveon is threatened. Entry hazard setters like Clefable and Klefki make it easier for Sylveon to secure KOs, and Sylveon can also force switches. Finally, Babiri Berry Togekiss and Clefable can help check Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, allowing Sylveon to fire off Hyper Voice more easily.</p> "

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Prankster Klefki is a great support Pokemon because of its access to priority Spikes, Thunder Wave, Reflect, and Light Screen, which allows teammates such as Azumarill to set up easier. Klefki's typing provides it with a large number of resistances, including Normal, Flying, and Fairy, along with an immunity to Poison-type moves, which allows it to check threats like Alolan Muk and Nihilego. Due to Klefki's great defensive typing and access to priority status moves, it can easily set Spikes or screens multiple times throughout the battle. It can also cripple fast setup sweepers such as Porygon-Z with Prankster Thunder Wave. However, its bulk is subpar without screens. While Klefki can paralyze setup sweepers, it should be noted that Klefki may become a liability, as many can continue to set up on Klefki regardless. Klefki is incredibly passive and, when lacking Foul Play, it can be used as setup fodder by certain Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Klefki relies heavily on its use of support moves and has a pitiful offensive presence, making it very vulnerable to Taunt. Klefki also lacks reliable recovery, causing it to be easily worn down by attacks and entry hazards.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Klefki is a useful Pokemon on offensive Steel teams due to its status as the best dual screens setter available to them. Hyper offensive Steel teams greatly appreciate its support, as they have a wide variety of setup sweepers, such as Mega Scizor, Jirachi, and Celesteela, to exploit it. Klefki's Prankster ability gives it a unique niche of priority status moves, which almost always ensures that Reflect or Light Screen will go up before the opponent hits Klefki. Access to Spikes and Thunder Wave allows Klefki to pressure the opposing side by supplying lasting chip damage or crippling offensive Pokemon. Unfortunately, Klefki is very passive and can easily be threatened out by Taunt and certain Defog users such as Tapu Koko and Gliscor. Even with Foul Play and Thunder Wave, certain setup sweepers like Diggersby and Landorus-T can proceed to set up on it without fear as well. Klefki's defensive presence is also hindered by its vulnerability to two of Steel's weaknesses, Fire and Ground, and lack of reliable recovery.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple annoying setup Pokemon; however, Klefki misses out on being able to immediately cut the Speed of opposing Pokemon in half with Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Toxic can be used to put a timer on threatening Pokemon like Zapdos and Garchomp as well as being useful against various Ground- and Electric-types; however, the immediate halving of Speed by Thunder Wave and the pressure against setup sweepers caused by Foul Play are usually much more helpful.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types can easily muscle through Klefki with their powerful STAB attacks, leaving Klefki with very little time to get screens or Spikes up. Dugtrio can trap Klefki and heavily damage it with Earthquake, preventing Klefki from setting screens or Spikes up late-game.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types can easily break through Klefki with their strong STAB attacks, leaving it with very little time to set screens or Spikes up. Mega Charizard Y deserves a special mention, as it can OHKO Klefki behind Light Screen with Drought-boosted Fire Blast. Rotom-H can set screens up on Klefki, severely weaken it with STAB Overheat, and swap its Light Clay for a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Klefki is completely reliant on support moves, so Taunt users such as Gliscor and Cobalion completely shut it down and usually don't fear Thunder Wave or Foul Play. Defensive Mew can use Taunt on Klefki but fears Thunder Wave, as it is no longer able to outspeed Tapu Bulu and check it with Will-O-Wisp if paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos deserves a special mention because it can remove Klefki's Spikes, is immune to Thunder Wave, can threaten Klefki with Heat Wave, and can pick up momentum against Klefki with Volt Switch. SubToxic Zapdos sets can also use Klefki to easily set a Substitute up.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Klefki's poor bulk, it is easily worn down by a multitude of strong wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Tapu Koko, Mega Charizard X, and Landorus, making it harder for it to stay in longer, keep screens up, and stack Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types are immune to Klefki's Thunder Wave. Magnezone can also trap Klefki with Magnet Pull, completely disabling it from setting screens up later in the game.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Pokemon with Taunt can force Klefki to use either Foul Play or Struggle, making it effectively useless. Pokemon that run Taunt such as Heatran and Gliscor also have super effective moves that they can damage Klefki with.</p> <p><strong>Defog Users: Defog is a huge threat to Klefki because of its removal of screens and Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus are immune to Thunder Wave and can use Klefki to freely attack and set up. Landorus especially can use Gravity, which greatly threatens Steel teams, while taking little damage from Foul Play. Dugtrio can trap Klefki, especially Thunder Wave variants, which cannot do anything to it, removing its ability to set up screens for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types are also immune to Thunder Wave, and Pokemon like Tapu Koko can shut Klefki down with Taunt, while Zapdos can remove its screens with Defog. Magnezone and Alolan Golem can trap Klefki and prevent it from supporting a teammate with screens.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie can bounce back Klefki's Spikes and Thunder Wave, lowering its ability to do anything besides set up screens, as even the threat of switching these Pokemon in can dissuade the player from using these moves.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Reflect and Light Screen allow Klefki to provide itself and its teammates with a solid boost to their defenses, allowing teammates like Tapu Bulu to clean more easily and giving setup sweepers such as Azumarill an easier time setting up. Spikes is used to give setup sweepers such as Azumarill an easier time cleaning the opposing team. Importantly, it pressures Steel teams, which frequently lack entry hazard removal, and is almost necessary for turning the tables on that matchup. Foul Play in tandem with Reflect allows Klefki to actively check an abundance of physical setup sweepers, most importantly including offensive Mega Scizor, and having Foul Play prevents Klefki from becoming complete Taunt bait. However, Thunder Wave allows Klefki to check many threatening setup sweepers, including Mega Charizard X, Porygon-Z, and Mew outside of Psychic Terrain by slowing them down, making it a strong option for teams that already cover Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Light Clay allows Klefki to extend the length of screens' effects from five to eight turns, giving teammates more time to benefit from them. The EV spread and nature allows Klefki to maximize its physical bulk, letting it more easily take on physical threats such as Mega Scizor. Prankster causes Klefki's support moves to have priority, making up for Klefki's suboptimal Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Klefki can be used as a pivot into many attackers, including Nasty Plot-boosted Mew, due to its fantastic typing. If there are threatening setup sweepers on the opposing team, Klefki should be preserved for late-game, when it can set screens up again and cripple physical setup sweepers with Foul Play. Due to Klefki's passiveness, it should be switched out after screens are up when against sweepers that don't mind its status moves such as Xurkitree to not give them free turns. Despite having a fantastic typing, Klefki shouldn't be randomly switched into attacks due to its overall mediocre natural bulk and lack of recovery. You should try to keep Klefki healthy so it can set screens up through the entire game. Klefki should avoid using Thunder Wave when there are Dark-type Pokemon on the opposing team, as that allows them a free switch into Klefki. Spikes should be set up early-game to chip away at the opponent's Pokemon and pressure them to remove hazards from the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azumarill can take advantage of screens to easily set up Belly Drum with Sitrus Berry or Normalium Z, then proceed to clean weakened teams without a Water-resistant Pokemon. Azumarill also appreciates Klefki's ability to set Spikes up, as it allows Azumarill to KO bulky Pokemon that would normally take a +6 Aqua Jet such as bulky Mega Scizor. Azumarill can help pick off annoying Fire- and Ground-types such as Victini, Volcarona, and Excadrill for Klefki. Tapu Bulu can help check Ground- and Water-types that trouble Klefki such as Hippowdon, Tapu Fini, and Gliscor. Tapu Bulu also appreciates Thunder Wave support, as its Speed isn't the greatest, and Klefki's ability to set screens up, as it can take Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb after Stealth Rock damage. Mega Diancie loves Reflect, as it is able to survive a Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor with its support, and with Spikes, Mega Scizor can even be OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire. Tapu Koko can easily gain momentum with Volt Switch and benefits from Spikes damage, which allows it to clean opposing teams with more ease. Clefable can form a hazard stacking core with Klefki, heavily chipping away at the opposing team and allowing setup sweepers such as Azumarill to sweep, especially behind screens. Clefable and Togekiss can both use a Babiri Berry + Fire Blast set if Klefki is not running Foul Play to help check threats such as Mega Scizor, and the latter can also remove hazards with Defog. Screens can allow Togekiss to check threats like Mega Scizor even better. Togekiss also provides a switch-in to Ground-type attacks for Klefki. Tapu Fini can use screens to help check Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon like Infernape and Excadrill with a Calm Mind set while also being able to clear hazards with Defog. Note that Klefki should not run Spikes on teams with Defog users.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Reflect and Light Screen allow Klefki to double its and its teammates' defenses, making it much easier for Pokemon like Mega Scizor to set up. Spikes helps pressure the opposing team with chip damage, which makes it easier for Klefki's teammates to sweep. Foul Play makes Klefki able to function when under the effect of Taunt. Along with the added bulk from Reflect, Foul Play can pressure Swords Dance users such as Mega Gallade. Thunder Wave is an option over Foul Play to cripple fast offensive Pokemon, especially special attackers like Porygon-Z and Heatran, that Foul Play can barely damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Light Clay boosts the duration of screens from five turns to eight, allowing offensive Pokemon to take advantage of the screens for as long as possible. Maximum HP and Defense investment enables Klefki to most effectively check Swords Dance users, the main target of Foul Play, as well as take advantage of its useful neutrality to Fighting. Prankster gives all of Klefki's status moves priority and is crucial for Klefki to effectively and consistently set up screens and Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Klefki should try to set up Reflect and Light Screen against Pokemon that cannot take advantage of it by boosting. However, because of Klefki's passive nature, it is usually unable to threaten the opposing Pokemon. Klefki should aim to put up Spikes along with screens if the opponent cannot pressure it enough to force it out. Other than that, Klefki should usually switch after setting up screens. Try to preserve Klefki throughout the game, as screens will often need to be set more than once, and Klefki lacks any form of reliable recovery. However, Klefki can also be used aggressively and let itself be KOed after setting screens if it allows a teammate to set up and win the game. Use Thunder Wave against fast offensive Pokemon that could be dangerous to the team, such as Victini and Mega Gallade. However, be wary that Electric-, Ground-, and Dark-types can easily switch into it. Foul Play should be used against foes trying to boost its Attack against Klefki, such as Mega Scizor and Mega Gallade. Spikes should be a priority early on to consistently chip away at the opposing team, but Reflect and Light Screen should be used mid- to late-game to allow a sweeper to set up and weaken or sweep the opposing team. Klefki is useful as a Scald switch-in because the burn does not affect it, and it can use most Scald users as fodder for setting screens. Make sure not to switch Klefki into a predicted Knock Off, however, as losing Light Clay weakens the effectiveness of dual screens support. When using Klefki, try to avoid trappers such as Magnezone and Dugtrio at all costs, because they can easily KO Klefki and stall out remaining screens turns, preventing teammates from using them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Klefki is a great partner for offensive setup sweepers, as its dual screens and Spikes support makes it much easier for them to use their boosting move and weaken or sweep the opposing team. Bisharp can switch into a predicted Defog used against Klefki and get a free +2 Attack bonus from Defiant as well as use Swords Dance to take advantage of dual screens support. Bisharp also appreciates Klefki's Spikes for chip damage and Thunder Wave to make up for its low Speed. Mega Scizor is another setup sweeper that appreciates the use of screens, as they boost its already appreciable bulk. Klefki’s Thunder Wave can also slow down Pokemon that Mega Scizor cannot KO with Bullet Punch, allowing it to use its stronger moves. A third Swords Dance user that can take advantage of dual screens is Lucario, which usually finds itself struggling to set up otherwise due to its middling bulk and lack of defensive utility. Choice Scarf Excadrill can pressure Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Magnezone, and its Rapid Spin enables Steel teams to remove hazards without the use of Defog. Heatran is a mandatory Pokemon to use on Steel due to its immunity to Fire via Flash Fire, an ability that makes it a great switch-in to Fire-types for Klefki. Heatran also provides Stealth Rock, creating amazing entry hazard pressure on the opposing team alongside Klefki's Spikes. Autotomize Celesteela is an offensive sweeper that also benefits from Klefki's use of screens and especially Spikes to wear down and sweep the opposing team. Celesteela can also switch into Ground-types that could otherwise easily KO Klefki with their STAB moves. Jirachi is another setup sweeper that can utilize both Z-Happy Hour and Calm Mind sets. Z-Happy Hour Jirachi appreciates Klefki's dual screens and Spikes support to help wear down the opposing team on entry, while Calm Mind variants enjoy screens to help increase the longevity of its Substitutes and to boost its Defense, which cannot be boosted by Calm Mind.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Mega Diancie's amazing Attack, Special Attack, and STAB options in Moonblast and Diamond Storm make it the best mixed wallbreaker for Fairy teams. After Mega Evolving, Mega Diancie's Speed is incredible for a wallbreaker, and it is able to check fast attackers like Mega Charizard Y and Nihilego that are otherwise difficult for Fairy to deal with. Its huge movepool makes it unpredictable, and it has many coverage options that it can use. In fact, with Psychic, Mega Diancie is the best check to Poison teams and is the only reliable way to break their defensive core. Access to Stealth Rock allows Mega Diancie to support its team further, while setup moves like Rock Polish make Mega Diancie capable of sweeping on its own, expanding its possibilities. Unfortunately, Mega Diancie's bulk is rather terrible, and its Rock typing makes it weak to many priority users such as Azumarill and Mega Scizor. While base 110 Speed is very good against defensive teams, Mega Diancie is still easily outsped by offense teams if it doesn't have Rock Polish. When combined with its poor bulk, Mega Diancie is very easy to revenge kill. Lastly, Mega Diancie suffers from serious four-moveslot syndrome, as dropping a coverage move for utility leaves Mega Diancie walled by key threats, meaning its vast movepool cannot always be fully utilized.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Mega Diancie stands out as the best Mega Evolution and mixed attacker for Rock teams thanks to its fantastic Attack and Special Attack stats and great movepool. These traits are accompanied by an impressive 110 Speed stat, allowing Mega Diancie to outspeed threats such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Mega Diancie takes great advantage of its Attack stat with Diamond Storm, a powerful and reliable Rock-type STAB move with a 50% chance to increase its Defense by 2 stages. This can be very helpful against threatening physical attackers like Breloom and defensive Mega Scizor, since it survives an unboosted Bullet Punch when at +2 Defense. With Magic Bounce, Mega Diancie provides fantastic utility, bouncing back entry hazards such as Galvantula's Sticky Web as well as status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Its part-Fairy typing along with a strong Fairy-type STAB move in Moonblast allows it to beat threats to Rock teams such as Mega Sableye. Its great movepool also allows it to provide a plethora of helpful coverage. Unfortunately, Mega Diancie's terrible bulk and defensive typing make it largely vulnerable to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Bullet Punch. Even with Mega Diancie's fantastic Speed, it's still susceptible to revenge killers like Excadrill in sand, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Jirachi. Mega Diancie also has difficulty fitting all of its beneficial coverage options onto a single set.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Calm Mind can be used to make Mega Diancie even more powerful, but it doesn't help Mega Diancie against offense, and Mega Diancie still cannot beat Chansey with it. Power Gem can be used alongside Calm Mind instead of Diamond Storm if desired. For all-out attacker sets, Hidden Power Ice is a viable option to beat Landorus and Gliscor, which Mega Diancie easily lures in. However, Skarmory will completely wall Mega Diancie in this case, and Mega Scizor can switch in without any fear. Nature Power can be a great option that lets Mega Diancie take out Ground-types such as Gastrodon when paired with Tapu Bulu's Grassy Surge. It can also be used with Tapu Koko's Electric Surge to 2HKO Celesteela and Water-types like Empoleon that otherwise give Mega Diancie trouble. However, these threats are already dealt with by the Island Guardian supporting Mega Diancie, so it tends to be redundant coverage for the team.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>Rock Polish can be used to give Mega Diancie a chance to sweep offensive teams. However, this is usually unnecessary with the speed control offered by Shuckle’s Sticky Web. Calm Mind can be used in order to increase Mega Diancie's wallbreaking potential, always OHKOing Tapu Bulu at +1 with Moonblast. Power Gem can also synergize with this, doing much more significant damage against Mega Venusaur than Diamond Storm would. Outside of this, though, Mega Diancie finds more use from the extra coverage provided by Hidden Power Fire and Psychic, and Diamond Storm is the preferred Rock-type STAB move in order to KO specially defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine more easily as well as obtain a helpful Defense boost. Hidden Power Ice can be used as a means of KOing Landorus and Gliscor. However, this would come at the cost of Hidden Power Fire, making Mega Diancie unable to 2HKO Skarmory and Ferro</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Gastrodon: Specially defensive Gastrodon counters Mega Diancie, as it switches into any attack and threatens to KO back with its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Certain mixed walls such as Chansey and Porygon2 completely counter Mega Diancie and can slowly wear it down. They do need to be careful of Magic Bounce reflecting their status moves, though.</p> <p><strong>Trapping: Dugtrio can trap Mega Diancie and remove it with Arena Trap and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Most Steel-types can survive at least one Hidden Power Fire and OHKO back. Mega Scizor is particularly good thanks to Bullet Punch, and Celesteela can switch into any move even when Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon can easily take any one hit from Mega Diancie, and offensive Ground-types like Excadrill can outspeed it and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types that outspeed Mega Diancie, such as Choice Scarf Keldeo and Kingdra in the rain, are capable of forcing it out with the threat of their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p><strong>Gastrodon: Gastrodon is one of the most consistent defensive answers to Mega Diancie, not fearing any of its attacks and being able to use Recover to heal any lost damage while wearing Mega Diancie down with Scald and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey and Porygon2 are never 2HKOed by any of Mega Diancie's attacks and can use their recovery to wear down Mega Diancie while keeping themselves healthy. However, with Calm Mind, Mega Diancie is able to beat Porygon2.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Choice Scarf Jirachi can beat Mega Diancie with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Kingdra, Mega Swampert, and Greninja are able to outspeed and KO Mega Diancie. However, none of these Pokemon will appreciate switching into a Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Rotom-C can outspeed and KO Mega Diancie with their Grass-type STAB moves. Tapu Bulu KOes even after Mega Diancie has a Defense increase, and Rotom-C is unaffected by Shuckle's Sticky Web.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Excadrill and Dugtrio can outspeed Mega Diancie and remove it with their STAB attacks. Dugtrio in particular can make sure Mega Diancie is unable to switch out thanks to Arena Trap.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf Keldeo and Tapu Koko are capable of outspeeding and KOing Mega Diancie, despite not being able to come in on a Moonblast.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Offensive (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is a powerful STAB attack that 2HKOes most offensive Pokemon that don't resist it. Diamond Storm has great coverage with Moonblast and breaks most special walls like Alolan Muk and Zapdos, allowing Mega Diancie to be a powerful mixed wallbreaker. Psychic makes Mega Diancie one of the best checks to Poison teams, as it 2HKOes everything except for Alolan Muk. Earth Power can be used over Psychic, as it allows Mega Diancie to still hit many Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex but also targets Pokemon such as Mega Steelix that otherwise blow past Fairy teams. Mega Diancie's ability to easily force switches makes it a good user of Stealth Rock if nothing else on the team can bring it. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire instead of Stealth Rock rounds off Mega Diancie's coverage by allowing it to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor on the switch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Naive nature are used to make Mega Diancie as fast as possible, outspeeding Alolan Ninetales and Keldeo and at least Speed tying with Latios and opposing Mega Diancie. All remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Mega Diancie's damage output. Clear Body prevents Intimidate and Sticky Web from reducing Diancie's stats before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In most matchups, Diancie should Mega Evolve as early in the game as possible in order to gain Magic Bounce, allowing it to switch into many walls to reflect their utility moves. Against teams with Sticky Web or Toxic Spikes, this is especially important to protect the team. Do be aware that Diancie's defenses are much better before it Mega Evolves, so keep that option in mind to defeat Iron Head Skarmory and even take a hit from Mega Scizor if Reflect is up. Mega Diancie's bulk is not great, so avoid switching into attacks, as even when resisted, moves such as Victini's V-create deal serious damage to it. Instead, use double switches and Magic Bounce to bring it in safely. Use Mega Diancie to wallbreak early-game for its teammates. Weakening checks early on can also give Mega Diancie more room to play with later on, and this is especially important for sets with Rock Polish. Against Poison teams, try to keep Mega Diancie at full HP for as long as possible, as Mega Venusaur's Giga Drain cannot OHKO it and the healing doesn't prevent Mega Diancie's Psychic from 2HKOing it with Stealth Rock support. However, Diamond Storm 2HKOes Alolan Muk, and it may be worth taking a hit in order to take out Alolan Muk to sweep with Psychic. If Mega Diancie is using Stealth Rock, it can take advantage of its huge movepool as a lead in order to set the entry hazard immediately while the opponent scouts for coverage moves. Both Stealth Rock and Rock Polish are easily used whenever Mega Diancie comes in threatening to revenge kill a target; if hidden well until this point, their use can easily surprise your opponent and give you a huge advantage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Klefki is an amazing teammate, as it provides Spikes support, allowing Mega Diancie to KO Mega Venusaur with Psychic even if it switches into Diamond Storm. Klefki's dual screen support is also incredibly useful, as it allows Mega Diancie to survive hits it wouldn't otherwise be able to in order to 2HKO most of the metagame. Tapu Bulu is another teammate that brings defensive support to Mega Diancie. With Grassy Terrain, Mega Diancie is actually capable of surviving even STAB Earthquake, and the healing is much appreciated. Tapu Bulu also takes on Ground and Water teams almost singlehandedly, making it almost an essential partner. Tapu Koko forms a powerful wallbreaking core with Mega Diancie, as Tapu Koko can break most Water-types and can handle most Steel-types as well if Mega Diancie lacks Hidden Power Fire. Azumarill tends to have trouble with Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Skarmory that Mega Diancie is very capable of luring in and removing. Clefable can carry Stealth Rock, enabling Mega Diancie to use a different move. Alternatively, if Mega Diancie still wants to use Stealth Rock, Clefable can use a Calm Mind set or even a utility move such as Knock Off. Clefable also often uses Babiri Berry + Fire Blast, which allows it to take out Mega Scizor for Mega Diancie. Togekiss can be another good anti-Steel option that can also use Defog to remove entry hazards that get past Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker (Rock)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Diamond Storm is Mega Diancie's best Rock-type STAB move, being able to increase its Defense by 2 while also allowing it to beat specially defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine. This allows Mega Diancie to function as a mixed wallbreaker rather than a primarily special one. Moonblast is used to hit Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types like Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Sableye. Psychic is a solid option alongside Diamond Storm, allowing Mega Diancie to effectively dismantle Poison's defensive core of Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk, specifically being able to 2HKO Mega Venusaur, which typically poses a threat to Rock teams. Hidden Power Fire allows Mega Diancie to hit Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, as well as hitting Mega Scizor on the switch. Earth Power is a good alternative, allowing Mega Diancie to KO Steel-types that aren't beaten by Hidden Power Fire, such as Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Naive nature allows Mega Diancie to outspeed Pokemon such as Landorus and Infernape. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty because the former will allow Mega Diancie to always survive Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick from full health. 16 EVs in HP are used to always survive Skarmory's Iron Head before Mega Evolving while 2HKOing it with Hidden Power Fire. However, if Earth Power is opted for, these EVs are unneeded. Before Mega Evolving, Mega Diancie will have the ability Clear Body, which makes it immune to stat decreases, which is especially helpful when coming in on Sticky Web. Upon Mega Evolving, it gains Magic Bounce, which allows it to bounce back status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave and entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Sticky Web.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In most situations it's a good idea to lead with Diancie and Mega Evolve against entry hazard setters in order to bounce the hazards back, which is especially helpful against Galvantula's Sticky Web, since Rock teams don't use any hazard removers. If possible, always take the opportunity to revenge kill something with Diamond Storm, since Mega Diancie largely benefits from the +2 Defense increase. Since Mega Diancie's bulk isn't very good, try bringing it in after another Pokemon on your team has fainted. In matchups like Dark and Dragon, try to make smart doubles into Mega Diancie in order to shift more momentum on your side. In matchups like Fighting, Grass, and Poison where you need Mega Diancie to be as healthy as possible, don't let it take unnecessary damage before it encounters an important threat like Breloom or Mega Venusaur. Sometimes it's better to hold off on Mega Evolving to take advantage of regular Diancie's superior bulk to allow it to survive a Hidden Power Steel from Latios, as well as being unaffected by Sticky Web and Intimidate thanks to Clear Body. Avoid switching into powerful neutral or resisted attacks, especially after Mega Evolving. Try switching into passive Pokemon such as Klefki in order to bounce back status conditions and hazards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle can set up Sticky Web for Mega Diancie to allow it to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Heracross while also being able to halt setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Azumarill with Encore. This frees a moveslot for Mega Diancie, since it won't have to rely on Rock Polish to outspeed most threats. In return, Mega Diancie can bounce back Stealth Rock to make sure Shuckle doesn't lose a quarter of its health upon switching in. Terrakion can break past defensive checks like Chansey and Porygon2 that would beat Mega Diancie otherwise while also being a solid revenge killer with a Choice Scarf, revenge killing threats like Hydreigon and +1 Mega Sharpedo. Tyranitar is a powerful physical wallbreaker that can set up sand for Mega Diancie, which boosts its Special Defense. It's also capable of trapping Latios and Gengar with Pursuit. Rhyperior and Alolan Golem are both capable of checking Mega Scizor for Mega Diancie. Rhyperior can serve as an effective physical blanket check against threats like Excadrill and Landorus-T, while Alolan Golem can trap and remove problematic Steel-types like Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Cradily can come in on Water-type attacks for Mega Diancie while also being able to beat Ground-types like Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. In return, Mega Diancie can check Fighting-types like Terrakion and Heracross while also bouncing back threatening status moves like Toxic. Omastar appreciates Mega Diancie keeping entry hazards away in order to be as healthy as possible while setting up with Shell Smash. It can also beat Ground-types like Hippowdon and Mamoswine with its Water-type STAB moves. Nihilego is a good secondary special wallbreaker that can beat Fairy- and Grass-types like Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Celebi with its Poison-type STAB move. It can also use its helpful coverage to remove Water-types like Swampert and Mega Slowbro with Grass Knot and Thunderbolt respectively, as well as Ground-types like Landorus and Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice.</p> "

  "Hoopa": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Hoopa's high Special Attack, low Speed, and access to Trick Room allow it to act as a wallbreaker and dismantle opposing teams as a functional member of the niche Trick Room Ghost archetype. Hoopa's additional Psychic typing allows Ghost teams to threaten bulky Poison-types like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Along with its decent STAB moves in Shadow Ball and Psychic, other coverage moves like Thunderbolt and Focus Blast improve Hoopa's overall coverage, hitting Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Gyarados, and Hydreigon. While Hoopa's abysmal physical bulk leaves it susceptible to strong priority moves like Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch even inside Trick Room, its outstanding Special Defense allows it to find setup opportunities in front of common special attackers like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. However, its typing also is its greatest weakness, as Hoopa is 4x weak to Dark- and Ghost-type moves. This means that it is weak to commonly used moves like Knock Off, Shadow Ball, Shadow Sneak, and Dark Pulse, which also makes it harder for it to find opportunities to set up. This also means that Hoopa is extremely susceptible to getting Pursuit trapped by opposing Pokemon. Hoopa also does not fit onto any other archetype of Ghost, as its low Speed leaves it outclassed by faster special attackers such as Blacephalon and Gengar when not used on Trick Room.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Trick Room Attacker (Ghost)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room allows Hoopa to utilize its low Speed to dismantle fast offensive teams and support its slower teammates. Psychic is Hoopa's primary STAB move, which hits Poison- and Fighting-types such as Mega Venusaur, Keldeo, Kommo-o, and Toxapex super effectively. Shadow Ball is Hoopa's main Ghost-type STAB move that hits Psychic-type Pokemon such as Jirachi and Slowbro and other Ghost-types like Blacephalon. Thunderbolt can be useful coverage against Water- and Flying-type Pokemon like Greninja, Mantine, Celesteela, and Mandibuzz. Focus Blast is also helpful to help deal with Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment is used to maximize Hoopa's survivability in battle. Life Orb along with maximum Special Attack investment and a Quiet nature maximizes Hoopa's total damage output. A Quiet nature also slows down Hoopa even more to make it faster under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Hoopa working best under Trick Room, it must either come in while Trick Room is active or set it up itself on a predicted switch against a slow wall like Toxapex. It should be noted that Hoopa's Special Defense stat is very good, so use this to your advantage in front of common special attackers like Latios, non-Dark Pulse Greninja, and Thundurus-T to set up Trick Room. Be wary of known Pursuit users like Mega Aerodactyl during the match. This is because due to Hoopa's typing and lack of bulk, it will almost always be OHKOed by an opposing Pursuit user, sometimes even if it stays in. Try to refrain from letting those Pokemon, as well as physical attackers in general, switch into Hoopa, as it will be forced out and causes you to make a hard switch. Refrain from taking chip damage, as it will make it harder for Hoopa to be usable in the match, since it needs to be healthy to try and set up Trick Room. Avoid getting affected by any status condition, as it will hinder Hoopa's ability to be useful in the match, whether it be through the chip damage that being poisoned or burned provides or the potential stun chance from paralysis.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Golurk is important for all Trick Room Ghost teams, as it can effectively use its powerful Dynamic Punch to scare off most opposing Dark-types and sets Stealth Rock, which can chip down the opposition. Cofagrigus is an excellent partner for Hoopa due to it also being a Trick Room setter and having an easier time setting it up thanks to its superior bulk. It can also support Hoopa by using Z-Memento under Trick Room so that Hoopa can come in for free and wreak havoc with full HP. Alolan Marowak is also a solid teammate on Trick Room Ghost due to its ability to wallbreak with ease thanks to Swords Dance and its Thick Club, allowing it to break past many walls that Hoopa struggles with, such as Chansey and Alolan Muk after a Swords Dance. Hoopa supports Alolan Marowak by providing another Trick Room setter. Mega Sableye is able to support Hoopa by reflecting any incoming status moves and entry hazards that may be directed towards it thanks to its Magic Bounce ability. Aside from that, it can also take hits from most Ghost- and Dark-type moves for it thanks to its bulk and further support Hoopa by crippling opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp or removing their item with Knock Off. Mimikyu is able to take down Dark-type threats to Hoopa such as Alolan Muk and Tyranitar, as well as be a good assisting wallbreaker thanks to its access to Swords Dance and a Z-Move. On Trick Room teams, Mimikyu is also a good Trick Room setter for the type, which is helpful for Hoopa and the other Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room. Gengar and Blacephalon both help keep faster foes in check outside of Trick Room that can pick off fast threats to Hoopa such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Gengar specifically helps more with Fairy-types like Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu, while Blacephelon helps more with Steel-types like Mega Scizor.</p> "

  "Decidueye": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Decidueye is a good defensive option on Ghost teams thanks to its access to effective utility moves. Its Grass typing and solid Special Defense allow it to switch into Ground- and Electric-types such as Landorus, Seismitoad, Tapu Koko, and Alolan Raichu. It is also the only viable Ghost-type with access to Defog, which allows it to remove entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise weaken Ghost's defensive core. With Spirit Shackle, Decidueye is able to trap defensive Pokemon that Ghost has difficulty dealing with like Mega Venusaur, Baneful Bunker Toxapex, and Clefable and eventually beat them after setting up with Swords Dance. However, Decidueye's Attack stat is incredibly mediocre without any boosts, leaving it unable to do any serious damage against offensive threats, and it's unable to hit Normal-types at all due to only running Spirit Shackle. Its lacking Speed stat also means that it can only check slow defensive Pokemon, and its low Defense makes it unable to switch into physical attacks from offensive Pokemon like Mega Diancie or Tapu Bulu. Decidueye also is extremely vulnerable to a plethora of defensive Pokemon, such as Mega Sableye, Alolan Muk, and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>Decidueye's access to Swords Dance along with its decent Attack and Ghost-type STAB moves allows it to serve as a setup sweeper on Grass teams. Its STAB Spirit Shackle allows it to turn the tide against Psychic teams, a normally hard matchup for Grass teams to handle. Spirit Shackle is also extremely useful for trapping, which helps Decidueye reliably pick Pokemon off with its Z-Move or set up with Swords Dance. Its powerful Z-Move in Sinister Arrow Raid allows it to KO bulky targets such as Toxapex, Celesteela, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn when boosted and further supports its sweep. Grass teams also appreciate Decidueye's ability to keep up entry hazards by acting as a spinblocker through its Ghost typing. However, Decidueye's limited bulk thins the number of setup opportunities it gets and forces it to set up against weaker Pokemon or late-game. Decidueye's underwhelming Speed stat also leaves it outsped by common offensive threats such as Heatran and forces it to rely on priority attacks such as Shadow Sneak to pick off faster threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ghost</h1> <p>An offensive set can be used along with Leaf Blade to allow Decidueye to beat Water- and Ground-types like Swampert and Hippowdon, which would otherwise invalidate its Spirit Shackle by phazing it.

Decidium Z is an option over Leftovers to break past walls such as Celesteela and Mega Venusaur with fewer Swords Dance boosts. However, this would come at the cost of recovery each turn, making it unable to consistently survive against Clefable and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>Leaf Blade can be used over Roost in order to hit Normal-type Pokemon such as Chansey, but the lack of reliable recovery hinders Decidueye's ability to set up comfortably. Sucker Punch can be used over Shadow Sneak as a stronger form of priority that hits Meloetta, but this is much more reliant on the opponent attacking and is worse against Mega Gallade.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spirit Shackle is Decidueye's main attacking move, used to trap defensive Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, Sap Sipper Azumarill, and Ferrothorn. Roost is used to give Decidueye a form of consistent recovery. Defog allows Decidueye to fill the role of an entry hazard remover, which is helpful for teammates that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Alolan Marowak and Blacephalon. Swords Dance augments Decidueye's offensive presence, allowing it to muscle past defensive walls like Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment is used to make Decidueye as bulky as possible. 100 EVs in Defense allow Decidueye to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Scarf Excadrill's Iron Head. 96 EVs in Speed let it outspeed Adamant Azumarill and remove Klefki's screens with Defog so a teammate like Mimikyu can safely revenge kill it. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense with a Careful nature, allowing Decidueye to safely switch into special attackers like Tapu Koko and Landorus. Leftovers is used to give Decidueye a small amount of recovery each turn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Make sure to keep Decidueye healthy so that it can switch into special attackers that Ghost has difficulty dealing with, such as Landorus and Tapu Koko, more easily. Against defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, try to predict when they'll go for a non-attacking move, such as Protect or Synthesis, to safely switch in. It's best to switch in Mega Sableye against an entry hazard setter that Decidueye is unable to beat, such as Torkoal, Swampert, or Skarmory. However, to preserve Mega Sableye's health, it's best to trap and remove entry hazard setters that can beat Mega Sableye, such as Clefable. Avoid status conditions as much as possible since burn prevents Decidueye from breaking past Mega Venusaur and Azumarill, and poison quickly wears it down each turn. It's a good idea to start setting up with Swords Dance when Decidueye is at full health so that it won't have to recover with Roost as often.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye can switch into Dark-type attacks for Decidueye and bounce back status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. In return, Decidueye can switch into special attackers like Landorus and Tapu Koko. Gengar is able to revenge kill Diggersby, Blacephalon, and Heatran for Decidueye. It can also absorb Toxic Spikes to allow Decidueye to safely switch in against Water and Poison teams. Mimikyu can check Dark-types like Hydreigon and Tyranitar. In return, Decidueye can remove entry hazards like Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web, which would otherwise prevent Mimikyu from sweeping late-game. Alolan Marowak can switch into Fire-type attacks and beat Steel-types that Decidueye can't handle such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor. Blacephalon can break past defensive walls such as Porygon2 and Skarmory and check threatening Dragon-types like Garchomp and Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice. Jellicent can switch into and beat Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona for Decidueye as well as switch into Ice-type attacks. It can also counter Water-types that can set up on or burn Decidueye with Scald, such as Calm Mind Keldeo and Suicune. In return, Decidueye can trap and eventually beat bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, which are immune to Jellicent's Toxic. Shedinja can switch into offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and defensive Mega Scizor, both of which beat Decidueye. It also appreciates Decidueye removing entry hazards in order to keep it alive.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance turns Decidueye into a threatening sweeper by boosting its Attack. Spirit Shackle is used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mew and Alolan Marowak super effectively while hitting the vast majority of the metagame, along with Pokemon such as Zapdos, for neutral damage. It also has the side effect of trapping the foe. Shadow Sneak is Decidueye's priority attack and is used to pick off faster Pokemon such as Blacephalon, Victini, and Latios when boosted. Roost provides Decidueye with reliable recovery, which helps it set up more comfortably without getting worn down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment along with an Adamant nature allow Decidueye to serve as an efficient cleaner by allowing it to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Decidueye to be as fast as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as Mantine and Metagross. Spooky Plate boosts both of Decidueye's Ghost STAB attacks, which allows it to always OHKO Victini with a +2 boosted Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock damage. Decidium Z can be used over Spooky Plate and lets Decidueye use Sinister Arrow Raid, a move that is capable of breaking through extremely bulky foes such as Toxapex and Celesteela when boosted. Long Reach prevents Decidueye from taking contact damage from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp when using Shadow Sneak. An alternative EV spread of 84 HP / 252 Attack / 172 Speed can be used for more power and bulk while still outspeeding Jolly Azumarill and -1 Choice Band Victini.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to preserve Decidueye so it can set up and sweep effectively. The ideal time to try to set up Decidueye is late-game when its checks and counters have been weakened. This is especially important in the Psychic matchup, where Decidueye can check a huge threat to Grass teams in Victini after Stealth Rock damage with a Swords Dance boost. However, in matchups such as Dragon, Dark, and Normal, where it may have trouble sweeping, try to use Decidueye mid-game to weaken the opposing team as much as possible for its other offensive teammates to sweep. Decidueye can also utilize its Spirit Shackle in order to trap passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and set up safely using Swords Dance. Wear down offensive checks such as Mega Charizard Y into boosted Shadow Sneak's range before setting up. Avoid taking unnecessary damage before Decidueye is ready to come in and sweep, as taking unnecessary damage will hinder its ability to set up with its already limited bulk. For the same reason, Decidueye should be brought in after a teammate has fainted or through an aggressive switch. Try to lay down entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes from teammates such as Cradily and Ferrothorn, as they help chip down the opposing team for Decidueye's sweep. This is especially important in the Psychic matchup, as Stealth Rock chip damage is needed for Decidueye to knock Victini out with a boosted Shadow Sneak. Similarly, try to switch Decidueye in on a predicted Rapid Spin to keep said hazards on the field. Status conditions, namely burn and paralysis, will hinder Decidueye's ability to set up and sweep by cutting down its Attack and Speed. Therefore, it should avoid setting up on status users such as Will-O-Wisp Mew and Thunder Wave Slowbro, as well as unnecessarily switching in on Scald. Sinister Arrow Raid should be preserved for bulkier targets such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Zapdos. Therefore, Decidueye should try to trap and isolate said Pokemon with Spirit Shackle in order to get a guaranteed hit on them. Decidueye should also be wary of Protect users such as Toxapex and Celesteela that can try to block Sinister Arrow Raid and play around them accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is a great partner for Decidueye because of its natural bulk, defensive typing, and Thick Fat, which allows it to take a variety of attacks such as Greninja's Ice Beam, Alolan Muk's Knock Off, and Celesteela's Flamethrower. It can also support Decidueye using Leech Seed and remove Toxic Spikes, increasing its longevity. Ferrothorn's good defensive typing and bulk allow it to switch in and take a plethora of attacks, while its Gyro Ball is able to knock out Ice-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and its Spikes are helpful for wearing down the opposing team for Decidueye's sweep. Its Leech Seed also gives Decidueye a form of recovery and helps it set up. With its good special bulk and Rock typing, Cradily is able to take on special Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T for Decidueye, while its Stealth Rock chips down Decidueye's checks and counters such as Victini and Skarmory for its sweep. In return, Decidueye is able to keep up Ferrothorn and Cradily's entry hazards by blocking Rapid Spin users such as Armaldo from removing them. Decidueye is also able to switch into Fighting-type moves such as Terrakion's Close Combat and Keldeo's Secret Sword for Ferrothorn and Cradily. Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can outspeed faster Pokemon that threaten Decidueye such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona and knock them out with Stone Edge, while its Grassy Terrain boosts the power of Decidueye's Leaf Blade and provides it with passive recovery, allowing it to set up more easily. Breloom can threaten Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Chansey, Bisharp and Hydreigon using Mach Punch and create setup opportunities for Decidueye with Spore. In return, Decidueye can threaten faster Psychic-type Pokemon for Breloom such as Latios and Alolan Raichu with its boosted Shadow Sneak. Whimsicott can support Decidueye by using Stun Spore to slow down faster Pokemon and Encore to create setup opportunities for Decidueye. It can also threaten Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B using its Moonblast.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Primarina is a very powerful special wallbreaker for Fairy with access to Psychic, helping immensely in the Poison matchup. Its typing is great offensively, as few Pokemon can switch into the coverage its combined STAB attacks provide. Primarina's Water typing also grants it a very important Steel neutrality, allowing it to take on opposing Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Excadrill, and its high Special Defense allows it to absorb special attacks throughout the battle, letting it take on Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Slowbro. However, its mediocre Defense leaves Primarina vulnerable to strong physical attackers such as Kyurem-B and Mega Pinsir, and its low Speed unfortunately leaves it easily revenge killed by foes such as Diggersby and Nidoking, forcing it to switch out multiple times throughout a battle. Primarina can be hard to fit onto a team, as Fairy isn't lacking in strong special attackers. It can also compete with Azumarill, which shares its same typing and is a very powerful setup Pokemon with useful priority.</p> ",

        "name": "Wallbreaker (Fairy)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is Primarina's main STAB attack, hitting opposing Pokemon very hard in combination with its high Special Attack. Moonblast is Primarina's secondary STAB attack, allowing it to hit Pokemon that resist Hydro Pump such as Dragon-types and Grass-types. Psychic is utilized on Primarina in order to hit Poison-types that take little damage from its STAB attacks, most notably Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Hidden Power Fire is run in order to blast past Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, which are cumbersome for Fairy teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature and Choice Specs allows Primarina to function as a wallbreaker, hitting the vast majority of Pokemon hard with its excellent coverage. Maximum Speed investment allows Primarina to outspeed opposing Pokemon such as Azumarill and Mega Venusaur. Torrent is Primarina's only useful ability, granting it a massive boost in damage from Hydro Pump when below 33% of its maximum HP.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a slow special wallbreaker, Primarina is best utilized to punch holes through the opposing team throughout the battle so that its teammates can clean up the remainder of its foes. Play carefully with Primarina in the Steel matchup, as it is important to keep it healthy in order to deal with Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which threaten to wear down the team. Similarly, due to its importance in the Poison matchup, play carefully with Primarina, only bringing it in after Alolan Muk has been severely weakened or KOed so that it can clean up the remainder of the team with Psychic. Be cautious of opposing Pokemon that can run Protect such as Ferrothorn, as they're able to scout which move Primarina locks itself into and then switch into a teammate that can handle its move. In a similar notion, be cautious of locking Primarina into a move that an opposing setup Pokemon can take advantage of. For example, in the Bug matchup, locking Primarina into Hidden Power Fire allows Volcarona to come in and get a free Quiver Dance boost. Be wary of switching Primarina in on strong physical attacks, as its mediocre Defense causes it to be quickly worn down throughout the battle. Take advantage of opposing Pokemon looking to set entry hazards onto the field like Skarmory and Jirachi by bringing Primarina in and firing off strong attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie forms a great offensive duo with Primarina, as they combined are able to blast past most defensive cores. Mega Diancie is also able to handle Alolan Muk for Primarina so that it can muscle through the remainder of Poison teams. Ribombee provides Sticky Web, patching up Primarina's low Speed and allowing it to outspeed everything up to maximum Speed base 100 Pokemon such as Victini and Mew. Tapu Koko takes care of bulky Water-types that Primarina otherwise has trouble with such as Empoleon. The combination of Tapu Koko and Primarina is also able to wonderfully take on Steel teams, as Tapu Koko handles Celesteela while Primarina handles Ferrothorn. Tapu Bulu is a great partner for Primarina, as it is able to absorb Grass- and Electric-type attacks that otherwise threaten Primarina. In return, Primarina breaks past many defensive checks to Tapu Bulu such as Mega Venusaur and Skarmory. Klefki provides screens support for Primarina, which enables it to survive Mega Scizor's +2 Bullet Punch. It is also able to provide Spikes and Thunder Wave support to slowly chip down opposing walls for Primarina to break through and slow down faster foes, respectively. Clefable is a great defensive switch-in to Primarina's threats and reduces the burden on Primarina to take care of Mega Scizor alone thanks to its access to Fire Blast. Its ability to set Stealth Rock onto the field slowly chips down foes throughout the battle, further enabling Primarina to OHKO opposing Pokemon late-game as well as 2HKO Mantine with Moonblast. Azumarill is an amazing physical wallbreaker that benefits from Primarina taking on physically defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, paving the way for it to clean late-game. Mimikyu is another Attack booster that acts as a great blanket check to many offensive Pokemon thanks to its ability, Disguise, and its access to priority.</p> "

Ribombee's decent Special Attack also keeps it from being overly passive and can let it check Dark-, Psychic-, and Dragon-types as well as other frail or weakened Pokemon with its high Speed. Ribombee has a varied support movepool, being able to paralyze foes with Stun Spore, clean weakened teams with Quiver Dance, or generate momentum with U-turn after it has set Sticky Web. However, its poor defensive typing and frailty make it reliant on Focus Sash to be effective. As a result, Ribombee typically cannot reliably set Sticky Web multiple times in a battle. Ribombee also is not strong enough to break past walls such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, and Celesteela, and it has limited coverage options and can easily be taken advantage of by threats such as Mega Scizor and Heatran.</p> ",

Moonblast is a powerful STAB move for threatening foes after Sticky Web has been set. Hidden Power Fire is used to keep Ribombee from being walled entirely by Mega Scizor, a dangerous threat to Fairy-type teams. Stun Spore is a strong utility move for crippling foes with paralysis. Quiver Dance is an option over Stun Spore to offer Ribombee a way to clean weakened teams and can be used alongside Bug Buzz to pressure Psychic teams. However, without Stun Spore, Ribombee has a much harder time threatening Pokemon in the metagame. Bug Buzz is a strong STAB move that can be used over Hidden Power Fire and is useful for threatening Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mew or Celebi.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Ribombee to outspeed most leads and set Sticky Web reliably. Full Special Attack investment keeps Ribombee from being passive and can help it set Sticky Web by breaking through Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Focus Sash is mandatory to compensate for Ribombee's poor defenses, guaranteeing a turn to set Sticky Web. Shield Dust protects Ribombee from secondary effects, which has utility in protecting it from flinching or being burned by Scald.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ribombee should typically be used as a lead to get Sticky Web up as soon as possible to support the rest of the team. After setting Sticky Web, Ribombee's second priority is to spread status with Stun Spore. Preserve Ribombee against teams with effective entry hazard removers such as Zapdos and Armaldo, as it may need to set Sticky Web again. It's also a good idea to keep Ribombee healthy in matchups against types such as Psychic, Dragon, and Dark, where its STAB moves and high Speed are useful. While Ribombee can 2HKO Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye with Moonblast, be wary of Magic Bounce users, as they can still bounce back Sticky Web, crippling Ribombee's teammates. Attempt to preserve Ribombee's Focus Sash when possible in case you need an emergency check to threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Victini, which is also Ribombee's only role in the matchup against Flying, where Sticky Web is useless.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Fairy is an offensive type, almost every Pokemon benefits from the speed control Ribombee's Sticky Web offers. Tapu Koko is a powerful offensive pivot and wallbreaker that outspeeds nearly the entire metagame under the effect of Ribombee's Sticky Web. Mega Diancie is a potent mixed attacker that benefits from Sticky Web support to outrun threats such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Excadrill. Tapu Bulu is another offensive powerhouse that appreciates Sticky Web support to outspeed the majority of the metagame when running Choice Scarf. Ribombee's support can also open Tapu Bulu up to run powerful wallbreaking sets such as Choice Band and Swords Dance. Azumarill is an incredible setup sweeper for Fairy-type teams that can outspeed checks such as Mega Venusaur and Seismitoad with Sticky Web support. Other setup sweepers such as Togekiss likewise benefit from Sticky Web support. Klefki is an incredible utility Pokemon that can further support Fairy's offensive threats alongside Ribombee by setting Light Screen, Reflect, and Spikes, by spreading status, and by checking Mega Scizor with Foul Play. Mimikyu is a decent setup sweeper and effective blanket check to offensive threats across the metagame with its ability Disguise and can also help put pressure on Psychic teams.</p> "

  "Toxapex": {
    "overview": "<h1>Water</h1> <p>Toxapex's amazing bulk and its ability Regenerator make it one of the best pivots available to Water teams. Its typing further augments its natural bulk, providing it a valuable neutrality to Grass-type moves that is greatly appreciated by Water teams. This allows it to take on threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona better. Toxapex also has access to plenty of useful utility moves, notably Recover, Toxic Spikes, and Haze as well as a decent STAB move in Scald that may burn the foe, rendering most physical attackers like Mega Scizor near useless. However, Toxapex has very little actual offensive presence due to its abysmal offensive stats. Moreover, its low Speed stat leaves it vulnerable to stallbreakers utilizing Taunt or Substitute, and it stacks another weakness to Ground, which Water teams generally tend to have a lack of switch-ins to. Despite its generally passive nature, however, Toxapex manages to fit well on not only stall team archetypes but balance teams too.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Toxapex is the best defensive pivot available to Poison-type teams, thanks to its Regenerator ability enabling it to take damage and recover it when switched out and its great Defense and Special Defense stats allowing it to take heavy hits from Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Mega Pinsir. Toxapex's Water typing also helps Poison-type teams deal with the matchup against Bug-type teams by enabling it to use Haze on Volcarona and Mega Scizor whilst resisting both of their STAB attacks. Haze + Icium Z allows Toxapex to check major threats to Poison teams such as Taunt Kommo-o that can otherwise easily break past the rest of the type. The same Water typing also makes it a key Pokemon when dealing with Fire-type teams as well as some Flying-type teams that rely on Mega Charizard Y as the wallbreaker. Toxapex's solid movepool for a bulky Pokemon gives it reliable recovery through Recover as well as utility moves in Toxic Spikes and Haze to support the rest of the team. Scald is Toxapex's only commonly used attack, and its 30% chance to burn gives it a good chance to shut down physical threats to Poison-type teams, such as Mega Gallade and Landorus-T, when spammed. However, Toxapex has to rely on this move for dealing damage and hope for burns when faced with Taunt users; otherwise, it is dead weight to the team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p>A specially defensive set is an option to take on special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y better. It is generally outclassed by the standard set because physical attackers like Mega Pinsir and Tapu Bulu can be more threatening to Water teams and Mantine does a better job as a specially defensive Grass-neutral Pokemon anyway, but it comes down to what your team needs. Furthermore, a mixed defensive set with 80 EVs invested in Special Defense can also be used to let Toxapex survive a Psychic from Mega Alakazam. Rocky Helmet hurts whatever makes contact with Toxapex, which helps when switching in on physical attackers. However, a bit of recovery per turn is a lot more useful, as Toxapex doesn't like to waste too many turns using Recover after switching in on an attack. Alternatively, Toxic can also be used on Toxapex. This allows it to take on more Pokemon in a one-on-one scenario without having to rely on Scald. It's suboptimal compared to Haze and its other utility moves, however, because Water teams generally appreciate Toxapex's ability to switch in on setup sweepers like Mega Pinsir as they set up and nullify their boosts. Wacan Berry can be used with Sludge Bomb in order to beat Tapu Koko if it tries to switch in. Icium Z in conjunction with Haze can also be used to Haze Taunt users such as Kommo-O and Keldeo. Payapa Berry can be used with Haze in order to check threats such as Z-Happy Hour Jirachi without having to use a Z-move.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet is an option for Toxapex to cripple Pokemon making contact with it. It is good against Pokemon that rely on contact moves for beating Toxapex; however, it leaves Toxapex weaker to Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Heatran, as once it is weakened, Toxapex can no longer safely check them on the switch, especially after entry hazard damage.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Water</h1> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Stallbreakers such as Gliscor can shut down Toxapex with Taunt, forcing it to switch out or rely on Scald. Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce can even reflect Toxic Spikes, which can cripple one of Toxapex's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Strong Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Xurkitree can swiftly remove Toxapex with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Similarly to Electric-types, most Psychic-type Pokemon, notably Latios and offensive Mew, can easily break through Toxapex with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Most Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus can threaten Toxapex with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Hydreigon can muscle past Toxapex with their strong STAB or coverage moves.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Pokemon with Taunt such as Gliscor, Jellicent, and Heatran can wear down and eventually KO Toxapex without it doing much back to them, usually leading to Toxapex switching out and giving the opposition momentum.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko and other Electric-types can easily deal with Toxapex under Electric Terrain and gain momentum off forced switches.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Latios and Meloetta can break through Toxapex quite easily. Pokemon such as Mega Gallade and Victini also don't have much trouble breaking through the entire team and forcing switches.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Every Ground-type Pokemon is a threat to Toxapex. With STAB moves such as Earthquake, these Pokemon can deal huge damage to or KO Toxapex, forcing it to switch. With help from Venusaur's Leech Seed, Toxapex can put up a fight against Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon, but for the most part, you will have to switch to a Pokemon more suited to take on Ground-types. The biggest Ground-type threats to Toxapex include Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus. However, although Ground-type attacks are super effective against Toxapex, they rarely OHKO it, which allows it to use that turn to get up a layer of Toxic Spikes or fire off a Scald before switching out to get healed by Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Choiced Pokemon such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Choice Band Diggersby hit too hard for Toxapex to handle, forcing it out and giving your opponent momentum while dealing damage to the switch-in.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Physically Defensive (Water)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald has a chance to burn the opposing Pokemon, which is particularily useful for cripping physical attackers like Tapu Bulu and Dragonite. Recover lets Toxapex combat the Pokemon it pivots into much better and allows it to take on Grass-type Pokemon like Mega Venusaur in a one-on-one scenario. Toxic Spikes offers support to the team in the form of reliably spreading poison on grounded Pokemon that aren't Poison- or Steel-type. Toxapex finds it incredibly easy to set up both layers of Toxic Spikes with its amazing bulk, making the move a great choice. Haze prevents Toxapex from becoming complete setup fodder for Pokemon that aren't threatened by Scald, such as bulky Volcarona sets. Baneful Bunker can be used to scout for what move Choice item-using foes such as Meloetta and Diggersby choose to go for. However, it should only replace Haze if another teammate is a reliable counter to setup sweepers. Sludge Bomb can be used in order to threaten Tapu Bulu and prevent it from setting up Substitute for free.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Black Sludge is an excellent item for Toxapex, providing a bit of recovery every turn and helping Toxapex perform its job as a pivot even better. Regenerator is its best option as its ability, recovering its HP by 33% whenever it switches out. Maximum HP and Defense EVs along with a Bold nature maximize Toxapex's physical bulk and allow it to take on threats like Mega Pinsir much more easily. Moreover, they give Toxapex a chance to survive a Wood Hammer from Tapu Bulu and knock it out with Sludge Bomb.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Take advantage of Regenerator whenever possible. Double switch out to grab momentum on an expected switch instead of wasting the turn to Recover after coming in on an attack, as there are very few moves that Toxapex can't heal off merely through Regenerator and needs to use Recover for. Furthermore, after switching in on a hit that can be easily healed through Regenerator, Toxapex can fire off a Scald in order to grab a burn on whatever may switch in, in an attempt to wear it down. Similarly, setting up Toxic Spikes is also an option after Toxapex switches in to take a hit, but make sure you don't set them up pointlessly. If there aren't enough Pokemon that are actually threatened by Toxic Spikes, or if there's a Pokemon that can absorb the Toxic Spikes, it's better to just fire off a Scald or attempt to double switch in order to obtain momentum. Try to set at least one layer of Toxic Spikes as soon as possible if there are no Poison-types present to absorb it, as it can seriously cripple the opposing team. Keep in mind, however, that once Toxic Spikes have been set, you will not be able to burn Pokemon affected by it. It is sometimes wise to preemptively use Haze on a Pokemon that is likely to set up in order to avoid taking unnecessary damage while attempting to Haze it otherwise. Use Baneful Bunker to scout for what move a Choice item-using foe may go for. For example, don't switch in your Electric-immune Pokemon right away when you see a Xurkitree; there's a chance it might go for Energy Ball. Using Baneful Bunker will prevent such situations and grab momentum for your team. Try hard switching Toxapex in to use Haze whenever there's a Pokemon on the field that may set up, such as Volcarona or Porygon-Z, before it gets out of hand. With Porygon-Z in particular, Toxapex can use Haze to remove its one-time boosts from Z-Conversion, rendering it relatively useless for the rest of the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxapex's amazing natural bulk makes it a great pivot that is extremely easy to fit on both balance and stall team archetypes. Mantine proves itself to be an excellent partner for Toxapex, providing an immunity to Ground-type moves and the ability to switch in on special attacks that may threaten Toxapex with ease. Mantine also often runs Haze, making it easier for Toxapex to run Baneful Bunker over it. Swampert appreciates Toxapex's ability to switch in on Grass-type moves and can easily take Electric-type moves that threaten Toxapex. Defensive Azumarill sets that use Sap Sipper greatly support Toxapex by providing an immunity to Grass-type moves. Although this doesn't directly help Toxapex, as Toxapex does not fear most Grass-type moves, it lifts pressure from it because Azumarill becomes the primary switch-in to Grass-type moves instead of Toxapex. Furthermore, offensive Azumarill sets, primarily Choice Band, appreciate Toxic Spikes support, as it helps wear down the opposing team. Other wallbreakers and setup sweepers, such as Manaphy, Greninja, Keldeo, Gyarados, and Mega Sharpedo, highly appreciate Toxic Spikes as well, which makes it easier for them to clean up late-game. Moreover, they appreciate Toxapex's ability to take priority moves for them, as none of them with the possible exception of Manaphy like to stay in on strong priority moves. Slowbro and its Mega Evolution form an amazing defensive core with Toxapex, with the latter taking Grass- and Bug-type moves easily. In return, Slowbro and Mega Slowbro can take physical Ground-type moves aimed at Toxapex from the likes of Excadrill. Alomomola forms a great pivoting core with Toxapex too. It appreciates the fact that Toxapex can switch in on Grass-type moves and provides Wish support so Toxapex can go for another move instead of Recover after switching in to take a hit. Quagsire is another physically defensive wall that hates Grass-type moves. It stands out due to its ability Unaware, allowing Toxapex to run another move, such as Toxic, instead of Haze, as Quagsire can take care of most setup sweepers. Lanturn is another option to take Electric-type moves that Toxapex fears and provides a slow Volt Switch to help bring Toxapex in. It does, however, stack a weakness to Ground-type moves.</p> "

        "name": "Z-Haze (Poison)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Haze allows Toxapex to check setup sweepers such as Autotomize Celesteela and Bisharp by resetting their boosts. Scald is Toxapex's only viable attack and allows it to check physical attackers such as Mimikyu and Mega Aerodactyl by burning them. Recover allows Toxapex to stay healthy throughout the match, allowing it to consistently take on foes. Toxic Spikes cripples the foes through poison, chipping them every turn and allowing teammates such as Nidoking to wallbreak with more ease.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 140 Special Defense EVs alongside a Calm nature allow Toxapex to take +1 Psychic from Z-Happy Hour Jirachi after Stealth Rock damage while also allowing it to take on other special attackers such as Taunt Kommo-o more easily. The remaining EVs are invested in its Defense to maximize its ability to take physical attacks, such as Gliscor's Earthquake. Icium Z allows Toxapex to use Haze against Taunt users, allowing it to check threats such as Kommo-o that would otherwise proceed to sweep the rest of the team. Z-Haze also restores Toxapex to full health.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In matchups against threatening setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Azumarill, and Mimikyu, Toxapex should be preserved so it can neuter their boosts with Haze. Z-Haze can be used in situations where Toxapex can be revenge killed after it has removed a boost with Haze, preventing it from being knocked out next turn. Additionally, it can be used to check dangerous sweepers to the team such as Taunt Kommo-o and Z-Happy Hour Jirachi. Make sure to keep Toxapex as healthy as possible throughout the match so it can continue to check setup sweepers with Haze and act as a general sponge. Toxapex should try to keep Toxic Spikes up the entire game, as they give offensive teammates an easier time breaking past the foe's team. It should reset them on Defoggers and fish for a Scald burn to punish them for trying to remove its entry hazards. Toxapex should spam Scald to fish for burns against physical threats such as Mega Lopunny and Bisharp, making it harder for them to break past Toxapex. It can also be spammed to deter physical attackers from switching in fear of getting burned. However, in specific instances such as against Mega Scizor, Toxapex should scout for Facade to make sure it will not give it a power boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is a staple on Poison teams, as it can check bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Swampert, Suicune, and Hippowdon, all of which give Toxapex trouble. Additionally, it can provide Leech Seed support, allowing its teammates to switch in with more ease. Alolan Muk provides an immunity to Psychic-type attacks, which provides the team with a switch-in to threats such as Latios, as well as being able to provide support with Knock Off, crippling the opposing team. Alolan Muk can also Pursuit trap threats such as Latios for Toxapex. Crobat helps cover for Toxapex with its immunity to Ground-type attacks and provides Defog support, allowing it to switch into threats such as Tornadus-T with more ease. Additionally, it can Taunt entry hazard setters to prevent them from setting up their hazards and prevent Defoggers from removing Toxapex's hazards. Crobat can also be valuable in the Poison mirror matchup, as it can take down Mega Venusaur, which gives Toxapex trouble. Nidoking and Nihilego are Poison teams' premier Stealth Rock setters. Nidoking is the wallbreaker that provides an Electric-type immunity and has good coverage options such as Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Flamethrower, allowing it to take on multiple Pokemon such as Mantine and Ferrothorn. Nidoking is also a good answer to burned Facade Mega Scizor due to the drop to Bullet Punch's power allowing Nidoking to take it on safely with Flamethrower. Choice Scarf Nihilego on the other hand acts as a revenge killer for the team, being able to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance, allowing it to OHKO them with Hidden Power Ice and Power Gem, respectively. Salazzle can easily wear down slower Pokemon with Corrosion, which allows it to badly poison any Pokemon with Toxic and stall out their health with Substitute and Protect. It also makes facing Steel, Water, and Poison teams much easier by allowing Salazzle to cripple Pokemon in those matchups that are traditionally difficult to break past such as Celesteela, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive Pivot (Poison)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Toxapex's only decent attacking move and is extremely spammable as well, having a 30% chance to burn the opposition; it is a great way to get around being walled by Taunt users, and it is also good for crippling opposing Pokemon and getting chip damage against Pokemon that are immune to Toxic. Recover gives Toxapex a reliable form of recovery and gives Toxapex the freedom to scout for moves from Pokemon that can't OHKO it. Toxapex can also use Recover to stall out Pokemon that have been burned or poisoned. Toxic Spikes is a great entry hazard that Toxapex can utilize well, as it is so bulky that it can reliably get up both layers without risking much. Toxic Spikes cause the foes to take chip damage throughout the majority of the match, paving the way for sweepers to have an easier time cleaning late-game. They also force the opposition to play around them to get a turn to Rapid Spin or Defog, giving your team momentum. Haze stops Toxapex from being setup fodder as well as halting sweepers from cleaning the team late-game; as it has nonexistent offensive presence, Pokemon such as Volcarona would have an easy time setting up on it otherwise. Baneful Bunker can be used over Haze, as it can scout out Choice item users. This lets you play better versus more offensive teams rather than having the safety versus setup that comes with Haze. Haze helps to stop Poison-type teams from being overwhelmed by setup sweepers, but Baneful Bunker is invaluable in the Normal matchup in particular for beating Diggersby.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Regenerator enhances Toxapex's ability to act as a pivot for the team. Being able to come in and out while taking hits and restoring HP each time is very valuable for the team. Black Sludge is used to give Toxapex passive recovery, giving Toxapex the chance to take more hits without relying on Recover as much. It is also the difference between taking two Earthquakes from Mega Charizard X and risking being KOed after Stealth Rock. Maximum HP and Defense investment is used so that Toxapex can take hits from Life Orb Excadrill nearly every time, as well as taking on Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Lopunny, Choice Band Victini, and a set-up Bisharp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switching in and out with Toxapex is better than using Recover if you have better answers to foes on your team. Utilizing Regenerator well with Toxapex allows you to take advantage of having a healthy wall during the late turns of the game. Going out to Pokemon such as Alolan Muk on special attacks and Mega Venusaur on physical attacks rather than trying to use Recover to stay healthy not only gives Toxapex more HP but also lets you get in a Pokemon that better deals with the opposition. Make sure that you keep Toxapex healthy if you see a threat that can set up easily on your team and sweep so that you can safely Haze it. Toxapex can take on Volcarona but needs a considerable amount of health to beat it at +1 if Volcarona carries Hidden Power Ground. Take advantage of how spammable Scald is by trying to cripple physical attackers such as Garchomp and Mega Gallade or Pokemon immune to poison. Try to get up two layers of Toxic Spikes when facing balance teams, as it will be more damaging over time. Getting up at least one layer of Toxic Spikes is important, as any chip damage is crucial. Use Baneful Bunker to scout for Choice item users to give yourself a better opportunity at a safer switch. Against Normal teams, this is essential for poisoning and stalling Choice Band Diggersby.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Muk is a great teammate for Toxapex, as the Assault Vest set with Pursuit and Poison Touch can trap and KO Psychic-types that threaten Toxapex. Its immunity to Psychic also means it can isolate and KO Psychic-type Pokemon on other teams such as Jirachi on Steel, Latios and Latias on Dragon, and Victini on Fire. Knock Off can also make it easier for Toxapex to check Pokemon by removing Choice items and Leftovers. Mega Venusaur works well with Toxapex, naturally resisting one of Toxapex's weaknesses in Electric-type attacks, giving Toxapex less pressure. It is also neutral to Ground-type attacks. Thus, Mega Venusaur can help Toxapex deal with Pokemon such as Excadrill and Tapu Koko. Crobat works well with Toxapex, as it is immune to Ground and can support Toxapex with dealing with other bulky Pokemon. It also has good synergy with Toxapex as a pivot, with Crobat being a fast U-turn pivot and Toxapex being a slow Regenerator pivot, and it can act as a stallbreaker or prevent Defog with Taunt and get rid of entry hazards with Defog. Nihilego is arguably the best Choice Scarf sweeper to pair with Toxapex, as it can take advantage of burn and poison chip to clean late-game. It also gets a nice boost with Beast Boost after each KO, meaning it can first take out Pokemon with lower HP and then take on bulkier Pokemon after the boost. It can also be used as a Stealth Rock hazard setter. Nidoking provides an Electric-type immunity that Toxapex can take advantage of. The ability to switch in Nidoking on Electric-types and deal with them with Earth Power or any of its amazing coverage moves is very good for Toxapex. Nidoking's great coverage also supports Toxapex with Ice Beam for Ground-type Pokemon as well as Thunderbolt to help deal with the Flying-type Pokemon that are unaffected by Toxic Spikes. Gengar's heavy-hitting attacks and great Speed tier make it a great option with any of Life Orb, Choice Specs, and Choice Scarf. It can break through teams or sweep teams late-game after chip damage from Toxic Spikes and Scald. Scolipede can set up and sweep late-game also if Toxapex has successfully crippled the opposition's team.</p> "

  "Araquanid": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Araquanid's signature ability Water Bubble offers tremendous offensive and defensive utility to Bug, halving the damage taken from Fire-type attacks, doubling the power of Water-type attacks, and making Araquanid immune to burns. Araquanid's high Special Defense and resistance to Fire and Water moves allow it to function as a specially defensive tank on Bug, allowing it to check special threats like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. It can also serve as a Sticky Web setter to allow other Pokemon to be used over Galvantula, such as Yanmega. However, Araquanid is one-dimensional offensively, as outside of its Water-type STAB moves, it is very weak and cannot threaten Pokemon with coverage. Araquanid's weakness to Electric-type attacks is problematic for Bug, as the type lacks sturdy resistances to Electric-type moves and struggles with threats like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu. Araquanid can also struggle with longevity, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and lacks reliable recovery. Araquanid is slow and cannot outspeed even uninvested defensive threats such as Mega Venusaur; combined with its one-dimensional offenses, this can make it a momentum drain on Bug teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>Choice Band Araquanid can be run as a wallbreaker on more offensive teams that still checks special attackers with its natural bulk; however, this set is a much less sturdy check to threats in the metagame like Volcarona. Magic Coat can be used over Toxic or Mirror Coat on Sticky Web Araquanid to try to prevent entry hazards from going up or being afflicted by Taunt. However, Magic Coat is very inconsistent and can cost Araquanid severe momentum. Leftovers is an option over Wacan Berry or Focus Sash on the Sticky Web utility set to give Araquanid more longevity with passive recovery, but this can limit the threats it can check.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Araquanid has poor Defense and cannot take unresisted hits from physical attackers like Mega Sharpedo and Tapu Bulu.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>With its power doubled by Water Bubble, Liquidation is Araquanid's strongest and most spammable attack. Scald is a weaker Water-type STAB move with a 30% burn chance, which is helpful for pestering defensive threats that Araquanid can't break with Liquidation or Water-resistant targets such as those on Dragon- and Water-types. Leech Life is a Bug-type STAB move, useful against Psychic-types and bulky Water-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Slowbro and Seismitoad, that can keep Araquanid healthy for checking threats. Mirror Coat is a useful tool for checking special attackers that are not threatened by Araquanid's other three attacks like Volcanion which also manages threats that can 2HKO Araquanid like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature give Liquidation and Leech Life the most damage output possible. 68 Speed EVs allow Araquanid to outspeed key special walls such as Chansey and Alolan Muk, as well as Hippowdon and Azumarill after Sticky Web. The remaining EVs go into HP to improve Araquanid's bulk. Water Bubble doubles the damage dealt by Water-type attacks, halves the damage taken by Fire-type attacks, and grants an immunity to burns. Assault Vest bolsters Araquanid's Special Defense to make it as formidable of a special switch-in as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Araquanid as a switch-in and offensive check to special threats in the metagame such as Kingdra and Mega Charizard Y. Preserve Araquanid when faced with powerful Pokemon that can otherwise sweep the team, like Volcarona, Choice Scarf Victini, and Porygon-Z so that it can revenge kill them with Liquidation or Mirror Coat. Use Liquidation liberally, as it is Araquanid's strongest move; even when resisted, it is more powerful than Leech Life. Scald should be used to burn defensive threats that aren't threatened by Liquidation such as Skarmory and Toxapex. It can also be used to pester physical attackers such as Dragonite that are switching in to take advantage of Araquanid's poor Defense. Use Araquanid's immunity to burns to switch into Scald and absorb Will-O-Wisp from threats such as Mega Sableye. It is essential that entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, are kept off Araquanid's side of the field, as they compromise its ability to switch in on threats. Araquanid has mediocre Defense and should not risk taking unresisted physical attacks, even from defensive threats like Skarmory and Mandibuzz.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Forretress and Armaldo are reliable Rapid Spin users that help keep Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes off the field so that Araquanid can operate effectively. Forretress's Steel typing offers a neutrality to the Rock- and Flying-type attacks that Araquanid struggles with, while Armaldo's Rock typing helps offensively deal with Flying-type threats that Araquanid can't manage like Zapdos. Scizor and Mega Scizor are both excellent partners for Araquanid, as their Steel typing covers Araquanid's Rock- and Flying-type weaknesses while Araquanid covers their 4x weakness to Fire-type moves. Scizor and Mega Scizor are able to force out threats like Nihilego and Mega Diancie with Technician-boosted Bullet Punch and can pivot with U-turn to create opportunities to bring Araquanid in safely. Galvantula acts as a strong offensive check for the Flying- and Water-types that Araquanid struggles with, such as Toxapex and Mantine, while offering valuable Sticky Web support to the team. Volcarona is a potent wincon that benefits from the holes Araquanid punches with its powerful STAB moves and its Fire- and Water-type resistances. Mega Pinsir benefits greatly as a sweeper from the damage dealt to defensive cores by Araquanid's powerful Water-type STAB moves, and it is especially effective against the bulky Water and Grass teams that Araquanid can't touch. Choice Scarf Heracross and Buzzwole are strong revenge killers and cleaners whose powerful STAB and coverage moves help dispatch of the Steel-, Grass-, and Rock-types that Araquanid can't easily manage. Buzzwole's Ice-type coverage is tremendously helpful in the Dragon- and Ground-type matchups, and Heracross can utilize Pursuit to take pressure off Araquanid to manage threats such as Heatran and Victini.</p> "

Toxic lets Araquanid put defensive walls that aren't threatened by Scald such as Mantine and Porygon2 on a timer. Mirror Coat helps Araquanid check dangerous special attackers it cannot threaten with Scald such as Tapu Koko and Porygon-Z.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature give Araquanid the most special bulk possible to manage threats such as Mega Charizard Y, and the remaining EVs go into HP to further improve Araquanid's bulk. A Wacan Berry is used to let Araquanid stomach hits from powerful Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu and either KO them in return with Mirror Coat or set Sticky Web in a matchup where that would otherwise be impossible. Water Bubble doubles the damage dealt by Water-type attacks, halves the damage taken from Fire-type attacks, and grants an immunity to burns. Focus Sash is an option over Wacan Berry so that Araquanid can check more threats such as Mega Diancie and act as a suicide lead.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Araquanid's first priority should be to set Sticky Web in any given matchup so that teammates like Mega Pinsir and Volcarona can sweep more easily; however, take care to keep Araquanid healthy when it is needed to check threats such as Volcarona or Alolan Raichu.

Both are also able to check threats such as Nihilego with Bullet Punch and pivot into Araquanid with U-turn. Volcarona and Mega Pinsir are potent sweepers that benefit from Araquanid's Sticky Web support to outspeed key targets such as Choice Scarf Victini. Choice Scarf users like Heracross and Buzzwole are effective cleaners whose powerful STAB and coverage moves help check the Steel-, Grass-, and Rock-types that Araquanid can't manage.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Poison</h1> <p>Salazzle is a good addition to any Poison-type team thanks to its niche with Corrosion, being able to badly poison Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Toxapex. With Substitute and Toxic, it breaks balance and bulky teams with ease; however, since it relies on setting up Substitute to be effective, it is dead weight against offensive Pokemon after it gets off a Toxic. Due to Salazzle's ability Corrosion, it can be very useful in the Steel-, Poison-, and Water-type matchups, using Toxic to cripple threats to Poison teams such as Heatran and Toxapex. Due to its resistances to those types, Salazzle can also easily set up Substitutes in the Steel- and Poison-type matchups, freely spam Toxic, and KO weakened Pokemon with Flamethrower. However, Salazzle's typing only compounds Poison's weaknesses, though its part Fire typing does allow it to take on Steel-types such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower. Also, due to its part Fire typing, Salazzle has a weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting the number of times it can switch in severely. Salazzle's below-average bulk makes its job of spreading status harder, as it has to rely on its Speed alone to get the job done. Salazzle also competes for the last team slot on Poison-type teams with Nidoking and Nihilego; furthermore, those two are Poison's Stealth Rock options, meaning if Salazzle is run another Pokemon will be forced to utilize Stealth Rock, limiting team coverage options. Doing so also leaves Poison teams without a powerful wallbreaker such as Nidoking for the Electric matchup, where it can beat Tapu Koko, or Nihilego for the Flying matchup, which can act as a powerful revenge killer.</p> ",

Toxic allows Salazzle to cripple any Pokemon including Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran and Mega Venusaur thanks to Corrosion. Protect allows Salazzle to scout attacks, gain Black Sludge recovery, and Toxic stall the opposing Pokemon. Substitute gives Salazzle a way to Toxic stall opposing Pokemon in tandem with Protect while also avoiding status such as Thunder Wave while also giving it a way to avoid weak attacks from walls such as Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature make Salazzle as fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Keldeo and Choice Scarf Magnezone. An investment of 252 HP EVs maximizes Salazzle's bulk while providing longer-lasting Substitutes, and 4 EVs in Special Defense give Download users such as Porygon2 a boost to their Attack rather than their Special Attack. Black Sludge gives Salazzle a form of residual recovery and allows it to switch into Stealth Rock four times. Corrosion allows Salazzle to Toxic Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Salazzle finds tons of use in the Steel matchup, as it can pressure Pokemon such as Scizor with Flamethrower, allowing it to set up a Substitute, and badly poison Pokemon such as Heatran. Salazzle should be preserved in this matchup, as it can apply lots of pressure by threatening to poison everything or wear opposing Pokemon down with Flamethrower. Since Salazzle is super frail, it cannot be directly switched into battle; rather, it needs to be brought in when an ally faints, on a predicted switch, or when an opposing wall is expected to use recovery and/or Protect. Salazzle should use Protect as frequently as possible to rack up Black Sludge recovery and to scout what move Choice-locked Pokemon such as Victini choose. Protect and Substitute should also be used to help Salazzle stall out Toxic damage against opposing Pokemon. Salazzle should set up Substitute against weaker resisted attackers such as utility Jirachi or when it forces a switch against Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn. Behind Substitute, Salazzle can readily spam Toxic to status opposing Pokemon and Protect to stall poison chip damage. Try to remove Stealth Rock from the field with Crobat before switching in Salazzle, as it takes a large chunk of damage from it and wears Salazzle down quickly. Since Black Sludge is Salazzle's only form of recovery, do not let it get removed by Knock Off from Pokemon such as Mew, losing it severely reduces Salazzle's time in battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All of Salazzle's teammates appreciate its ability to wear down bulkier Pokemon such as Celesteela and Toxapex, with Toxic thanks to Corrosion, making the matchup against balanced and bulkier teams easier. Mega Venusaur provides Salazzle with a switch-in to Ground-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Excadrill's Earthquake and Gastrodon's Earth Power. It also can provide Leech Seed support, giving Salazzle more opportunities to set up a Substitute and keep its health up in the battle. Toxapex also acts as a blanket check to many attackers, being able to switch in against a variety of threats such as Greninja and Mega Lopunny for Salazzle. Alolan Muk provides a much-needed Psychic-type immunity for Salazzle. It can also use Knock Off to remove opposing items such as Mantine's Leftovers and Pursuit trap Psychic-type Pokemon that present a threat to Salazzle such as Choice Scarf Latios. In return Alolan Muk appreciates Salazzle's ability to take on Pokemon such as Celesteela and Toxapex, which would otherwise beat it. Crobat provides a Ground-type immunity for Salazzle and can Defog away hazards such as Stealth Rock, severely improving Salazzle's ability to come in multiple times a battle and click Toxic. Crobat also can Taunt walls such as Chansey and Porygon2, preventing them from using their recovery moves. Nidoking and Nihilego are the viable Stealth Rock setters available to Poison and compete for the last team slot. Nihilego is a fantastic revenge killer that appreciates Salazzle's ability to cripple walls such as Celesteela, giving it a cleaner time sweeping late-game, and Nidoking in return can break Pokemon such as Gliscor that wall Salazzle otherwise.</p> "

  "Bewear": {
    "overview": "<h1>Normal</h1> <p>Bewear performs the role of a physical wallbreaker for offensive Normal teams with its high base 125 Attack stat and access to Swords Dance, allowing it to dismantle defensive cores such as those of Water, Steel, and Poison teams. It has a high HP stat and the ability Fluffy, which allows it to take reduced damage from contact moves and hence handle strong priority users such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Mega Scizor, and Dragonite, all of which are threats to offensive Normal teams. However, Fluffy also makes Bewear take double damage from Fire-type moves, making it vulnerable against Pokemon like Heatran. Bewear also has low Special Defense and Speed, which makes it vulnerable to faster special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Landorus. As a wallbreaker, Bewear faces competition from Diggersby, which not only has the ability Huge Power but also has priority in Quick Attack and an important immunity to Electric-type moves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p>A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon like Breloom, Bisharp, and Metagross; however, the damage drop is noticeable, as Bewear fails to achieve a KO on Pokemon like Toxapex and Slowbro with Breakneck Blitz after a Swords Dance boost. A Choice Band set can be used to take advantage of the immediate power; however, it is heavily prediction-reliant and drains momentum if locked into a wrong move. Fightinium Z can be used to have better matchup against bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Celesteela, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory at the cost of being less effective against bulky Waters.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Normal</h1> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye and Cofagrigus easily wall Bewear due to their good bulk. They can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, while Bewear hardly does any damage to them with its coverage moves. Cofagrigus can also use Bewear as fodder to set up Toxic Spikes or Trick Room against it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types such as Kommo-o and Keldeo are threats to Bewear, as they can score OHKOs on it with their high Special Attack.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Due to Bewear's ability in Fluffy, it takes double damage from Fire-type attacks, so Pokemon such as Heatran, Blacephalon, and Victini can heavily damage or even OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Hard-hitting special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Pelipper, and Latios can easily OHKO Bewear with their STAB attacks, as it has a low Special Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status-Inducing Moves: As a wallbreaker, Bewear does not appreciate getting worn down by residual damage, as that limits its wallbreaking potential and makes it easier to check. Bewear is also vulnerable to status-inducing moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, so common status inducers such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and defensive Celesteela can cripple it and put it on a timer.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Bewear to boost its already good Attack stat to even greater levels, letting it break through walls such as Toxapex and Slowbro. Return is Bewear's Normal-type STAB move and has good coverage in tandem with its Fighting-type STAB move, and when used with Normalium Z, it turns into a 160 Base-Power Breakneck Blitz that lets Bewear take out walls such as Mega Venusaur, Mandibuzz, Swampert, and Toxapex after a Swords Dance boost. Superpower takes care of Steel- and Rock-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Tyranitar. It also hits Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Celesteela for more damage than any other move on the set. Ice Punch allows Bewear to OHKO many Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite after a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature optimizes Bewear's overall damage output. Maximum Speed investment is used to make Bewear outspeed Pokemon such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Alolan Golem. Fluffy lets Bewear take contact moves better and check Pokemon like Mega Scizor effectively. Normalium Z turns Return into Breakneck Blitz, letting Bewear wallbreak effectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against a bulky team like Poison or Water, Bewear should focus on setting up Swords Dance in order to wallbreak; it can do so against Pokemon that do not threaten it like Alolan Muk. Against offensive types such as Dragon and Electric that lack a strong defensive backbone, it is best to focus on directly attacking more with Bewear, as it will hardly get a safe chance to set up Swords Dance against fast-paced teams. As Z-Moves are one-time use only, be sure not to waste Bewear's Z-Move on any target, as without it, Bewear will find it hard to wallbreak threats like Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, and Slowbro. Bewear is vulnerable to status such as burns and Toxic poison, so it should not be used to recklessly take Scald and should be kept away from Toxic Spikes. To take full advantage of Bewear as a wallbreaker, it needs opportunities to set up and attack and thus should be brought in the battle via aggressive double switches, through U-turn support or after a Pokemon has fainted. Even though Bewear has decent physical bulk thanks to its ability in Fluffy, it should not be directly switched into contact attacks too often and should be kept healthy to prevent threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Choice Band Extreme Speed Dragonite from cleaning late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Smeargle is a good partner for Bewear, as it can set up Stealth Rock to score easier KOs, cripple a Pokemon with Spore to provide chances for Bewear to set up Swords Dance, and provide Sticky Web support so Bewear can bypass its low Speed against grounded Pokemon. It can also utilize Nuzzle to slow down faster threats like Mega Diancie and Mega Gallade for Bewear. Diggersby can run a Choice Band set to overwhelm opposing teams with Bewear, as they form a very strong wallbreaking core, weakening down shared checks. Mega Pidgeot takes care of Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Gallade and Tapu Bulu for Bewear. It also provides U-turn support, letting it come in safely against a predicted switch. If Bewear is not utilizing a Z-Move, then Porygon-Z is a fantastic teammate and an amazing sweeper late-game with its Z-Conversion set. It can take advantage of weakened walls by Bewear and clean late-game effectively, and it also does a good job threatening Psychic teams for Bewear. Ditto is a decent teammate, as it can take care of faster threats for Bewear such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Gallade, and Mega Altaria. Mega Lopunny and Bewear form a Steel-breaking core with Mega Lopunny providing the additional benefit of dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon like Mega Sableye, which Bewear fails to do. It can also act as a revenge killer or cleaner, taking advantage of its high Speed and the wallbreaking potential of Bewear. Staraptor can run a Choice Scarf set to take care of Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o and Keldeo that are troublesome for Bewear. Defensive Staraptor can use Defog to keep Bewear away from entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes and act as a sponge for physical attacks for it. Meloetta can run a Choice Specs set to aid Bewear in wallbreaking by taking care of Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Mega Slowbro, and Toxapex. In return, Bewear acts as a Knock Off switch-in to Pokemon like Bisharp and Alolan Muk that threaten Meloetta out.</p> "

  "Mimikyu": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Mimikyu is essential to the success of most Ghost teams, as its role as a physical setup sweeper is highly appreciated due to the archetype's general lack of physical prowess. Its amazing ability in Disguise complements its access to Swords Dance and almost always guarantees setup. Mimikyu's additional Fairy typing gives it fantastic neutral coverage between its STAB attacks and allows it to check Dark-types that are often quite troublesome for Ghost teams such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Mimikyu also has access to useful STAB priority in the form of Shadow Sneak, which helps circumvent its poor Speed. The ability to function as one of the tier's most reliable Trick Room setters with Disguise further solidifies Mimikyu's influence on Ghost teams, giving it quite a bit of versatility. Unfortunately, Mimikyu suffers from its below average Attack stat, which leaves it reliant on setup to deal good damage. Mimikyu is also incredibly frail and has only average Speed, which leaves it prone to being revenge killed by common threats in Greninja, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Dugtrio. Disguise's lack of protection from status can also prove troublesome, as Mimikyu is crippled by all relevant forms of status.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Mimikyu is a decent setup sweeper for Fairy teams with the unique utility of acting as a blanket check for offensive threats due to its ability, Disguise. Disguise absorbs one attack for Mimikyu, guaranteeing it a turn to use Swords Dance or check a dangerous threat to the team such as Porygon-Z, Azumarill, or Victini. With Swords Dance and access to priority, Mimikyu can set up and sweep weakened teams. Its Ghost- and Fairy-type STAB attacks hit virtually every Pokemon in the metagame neutrally. Mimikyu's Ghost typing offers it a useful neutrality to Poison-type moves and an immunity to Normal-type moves, giving Fairy more options in managing threats such as Diggersby. It can also give Fairy an edge in the Psychic matchup, where threats such as Victini and Celebi can otherwise prove troublesome. However, Mimikyu's base stats are underwhelming. Even with unresisted STAB type coverage, its mediocre offenses leave it easily walled by defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Skarmory. Without Disguise active, Mimikyu's mediocre defenses leave it vulnerable to faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, and while Mimikyu has decent Speed, it is still outsped by important threats such as Landorus and the key base 100 Speed tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples some of Mimikyu's switch-ins, like Alolan Muk, but generally isn't worth it in comparison to either Shadow Claw or Shadow Sneak. Life Orb is an option on Mimikyu if another teammate is using a Z-Move. However, Mimikyu and its teammates heavily appreciate its ability to break past threats like Scizor and Celesteela with Ghostium Z.</p> <section><h1>Fairy <p>A Z-Crystal such as Ghostium Z or Mimikium Z can be utilized over Life Orb to provide Mimikyu with a more substantial nuke to break through defensive checks such as Swampert. However, this carries a large opportunity cost on Fairy, which has other more potent Z-Move users such as Z-Belly Drum Azumarill. Mimikyu can also run a Jolly nature instead of Adamant, allowing it to outspeed key threats such as Nidoking and Porygon-Z. However, this makes its Shadow Sneak significantly weaker, which makes it harder to sweep late-game.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex's typing and great physical bulk allow it to resist Play Rough and even survive a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare while in return crippling Mimikyu with either Toxic or Scald burns, removing its boosts with Haze, and recovering off the damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Scizor</strong>: Both Scizor and its Mega Evolution can use their typing and good bulk to tank even Never-Ending Nightmare if at full health, while they can use Bullet Punch to break Mimikyu's Disguise and OHKO it afterward.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Due to its below average Attack stat, Mimikyu struggles to break through Pokemon with exceptional physical bulk such as Skarmory and Landorus-T, which can threaten it with status, phazing, or powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela can withstand all of Mimikyu's attacks while resisting Play Rough and threaten it back with super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Due to its rather average Speed, Mimikyu is susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon in Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Garchomp.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker: Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Gyarados both carry Mold Breaker, which nullifies Mimikyu's Disguise and puts it into range of an OHKO from their attacks. Mega Gyarados, however, must be wary of Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Status: Mimikyu doesn't take kindly to any forms of status, as they compromise its sweeping capabilities. Paralysis halves its Speed and makes it significantly easier to revenge kill, poisoning shortens its sweep, and burns halve its Attack and limit its breaking potential.</p> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Due to Mimikyu's mediocre offenses, it is easily walled by common defensive threats such as Porygon2, Mega Venusaur, and Celesteela.</p> <p><strong>Scizor and Mega Scizor: Scizor resists Mimikyu's strongest attacks and is able to set up with Swords Dance and pose a serious threat to Fairy.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers</strong>: Mimikyu's reliance on Swords Dance to compensate for its lackluster Attack leaves it easily shut down by phazers and Haze users such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Toxapex, which it can't break unboosted.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Without Disguise, Mimikyu's frailty leaves it vulnerable to revenge killers and fast wallbreakers that are not threatened by Shadow Sneak such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <p><strong>Status: Mimikyu's capacity as a late-game sweeper and reliable check to offensive threats is greatly diminished by burn and paralysis, which can be inflicted through Disguise.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Swords Dance (Ghost)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance is mandatory for boosting Mimikyu's Attack to turn it into a formidable offensive threat. Shadow Claw is a powerful Ghost-type STAB attack that aids Mimikyu in breaking past slow, bulky threats like Mega Venusaur, Jellicent, and Zapdos. With Ghostium Z, it turns into a powerful Never-Ending Nightmare that, when boosted, can even break past the likes of Celesteela, Mega Slowbro, and Ferrothorn. Play Rough offers excellent coverage alongside Shadow Claw, hitting Dark-types that otherwise heavily pressure Ghost teams for super effective damage. Shadow Sneak is a reliable STAB priority attack that, when boosted, can pick off weakened threats and OHKO potentially threatening Pokemon in Mega Alakazam and Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack is essential for giving Mimikyu as much power with a neutral nature as possible. Maximum investment in Speed alongside a Jolly nature makes Mimikyu as fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon of base 95 Speed or lower like Porygon-Z and Kyurem-B. Ghostium Z is the preferred item, as the ability to break past Mimikyu's would-be checks in Scizor and Celesteela with a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare is invaluable. Disguise is Mimikyu's only possible ability, but it is extremely useful for providing it with an almost guaranteed setup opportunity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Mimikyu's ability to pick off most weakened threats, it is best used as a late-game cleaner, especially considering it excels once its common checks in Avalugg and Alolan Muk are removed. Thus, Mimikyu should almost always begin setting up with Swords Dance once brought into play. It can, however, use the combination of unboosted Shadow Claw + Shadow Sneak to revenge kill a foe that wouldn't faint to a boosted Shadow Sneak. Mimikyu should never switch into any attacks whatsoever, as Disguise will deactivate and possibly compromise setup. Thus, it is best brought into play via pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. Setup opportunities are best found against Pokemon that Mimikyu forces out, like Latios and Deoxys-S, or against Pokemon that often won't do much damage to Mimikyu, like Heracross and Buzzwole. Generally passive Pokemon such as Forretress, Porygon2, and Mantine also make good setup targets, though Mimikyu should fear their potential status attacks. If Mimikyu is in danger of fainting and hasn't yet used its Z-Move, it can use Never-Ending Nightmare to deliver one final blow. One thing worth noting is that by virtue of Disguise, Mimikyu can often function as a decent emergency check to setup sweepers like Porygon-Z and Bisharp, though it will need a teammate to be sacked in order to reliably take care of them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Steel-types like Skarmory and Scizor usually prove troublesome for Mimikyu, which makes Alolan Marowak and Chandelure good partners thanks to their ability to pressure Steel-types with Fire-type STAB attacks. Alolan Marowak is also useful in that it can weaken Mimikyu's checks due to its good offensive prowess and provide Stealth Rock support. Golurk can also provide Stealth Rock support, which allows Mimikyu to secure KOs on Pokemon like Jellicent and Celesteela. Will-O-Wisp support from Mega Sableye, Jellicent, and Gourgeist-XL is useful to Mimikyu for crippling physical attackers that threaten it and easing setup. Froslass is a particularly useful partner due to its ability to provide Mimikyu with support in the forms of Will-O-Wisp, Spikes, and speed control by virtue of Icy Wind or Thunder Wave. Doublade is also a particularly useful teammate, as its fantastic physical bulk allows it to reliably tank the physical attacks that threaten Mimikyu like Azumarill's Play Rough and Breloom's Bullet Seed. It can also use Swords Dance to help break past the checks it shares with Mimikyu. Due to its frailty, Mimikyu appreciates Decidueye's ability to pivot to safely bring it into play. Lastly, special wallbreakers like Gengar and Chandelure make good teammates due to being able to break past the physically bulky threats that can trouble Mimikyu at times like Skarmory and Forretress.</p> "

        "name": "Trick Room (Ghost)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room gives Mimikyu a way of adequately supporting its team with speed control. Shadow Sneak is a reliable STAB priority attack and gives Mimikyu a way of picking off weakened threats. Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest STAB attack, and it can be used to hit foes that don't resist it for fair damage. Destiny Bond is useful for when Mimikyu is close to fainting, and it can be used to both eliminate a foe and bring a teammate in safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP allows Mimikyu to tank a hit or two thanks to its good defensive typing, which grants it an easy opportunity to set up Trick Room. Maximum Attack investment allows Mimikyu to adequately punch holes in opposing teams while supporting its own. Red Card is highly useful in conjunction with Disguise, as it gives Mimikyu the ability to act as an extremely reliable emergency stop to most setup sweepers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's main function is as a source of support for slow wallbreakers. As such, Mimikyu should try remaining healthy throughout the match, as it will likely need to set Trick Room more than once. Disguise should be taken full advantage of when setting up Trick Room, as it will almost always guarantee setup. This means that Mimikyu should typically look to use Trick Room first unless it is attempting to revenge kill a foe with Shadow Sneak. Red Card will often only be situationally useful, but it should be preserved if an opposing team has a Pokemon capable of sweeping past Mimikyu's team, as this will allow Mimikyu to act as an emergency stop to it if need be. Destiny Bond should only be used once Mimikyu is low on health, as it will completely remove a foe from play while generating some momentum for Mimikyu's team. Prior to using Destiny Bond, it is best to try wearing down opposing teams with Play Rough.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slow wallbreakers like Alolan Marowak and Hoopa heavily appreciate Mimikyu's ability to support them with Trick Room, as they will be turned into fearsome sweepers. Slow Swords Dance sweepers like Dhelmise, Doublade, and Alolan Marowak are also appreciative of Mimikyu, as they will become immensely threatening once boosted under Trick Room. Entry hazard support allows the Pokemon Mimikyu will be supporting with Trick Room to break past foes more easily, which makes Pokemon like Golurk and Froslass good partners. Pokemon that can burn foes, such as Mega Sableye and Jellicent, make good teammates as well thanks to their ability to cripple physical attackers that otherwise prevent Mimikyu from lasting long in a match. Alternative Trick Room setters like Cofagrigus and Jellicent can provide Mimikyu's team with extra turns of Trick Room if Mimikyu has fainted.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough is Mimikyu's most powerful STAB attack and has near-perfect offensive coverage alongside Shadow Claw. Shadow Claw is Mimikyu's strongest Ghost-type STAB attack and is useful for threatening troublesome Psychic-types for Fairy such as Mew and Celebi. Shadow Sneak is a priority move that helps Mimikyu pick off weakened Pokemon and sweep teams alongside Swords Dance late-game. Swords Dance allows Mimikyu to clean late-game with a guaranteed usage through Disguise and is necessary to compensate for Mimikyu's otherwise lackluster Attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment allows Mimikyu to hit as fast and hard as possible. An Adamant nature is used to give Mimikyu the best odds for sweeping Psychic teams, providing enough damage output to put Mew, Mega Gallade, and Slowbro into range for KOs. Disguise is Mimikyu's only ability and absorbs one attack for Mimikyu, allowing it to blanket check offensive threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mimikyu should be used as a blanket check, utilizing Disguise to guarantee a hit against offensive threats in the metagame such as Greninja and Mega Diancie. It can also revenge kill certain threats such as Celebi and post-V-create Victini. Shadow Sneak can be used to pick off weakened Pokemon as well. Preserve Mimikyu's Disguise when it is necessary to check threats to the team, including strong setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Volcarona and offensive threats such as Sand Rush Excadrill. Because of Disguise, it can afford to be more reckless with taking chip damage from entry hazards. Take care to avoid status, especially burns and paralysis, as they greatly diminish Mimikyu's capacity as a sweeper. Mimikyu can also be used to sweep weakened teams late-game once its defensive checks have been removed, as Disguise guarantees it can use Swords Dance at least once. Remember that Mold Breaker bypasses Disguise, meaning Mimikyu cannot effectively check threats such as Choice Scarf Mold Breaker Excadrill and the rare Choice Scarf Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Diancie is a dangerous mixed attacker that can tear open holes in opposing teams and chip switch-ins with Stealth Rock so that Mimikyu can more easily clean late-game. Clefable can offer Stealth Rock support and also serve as a sturdy check to Mega Scizor, a major threat to Fairy that can sometimes take advantage of Mimikyu to set up. Klefki provides dual screens support for Mimikyu, which can allow it to pull off a second Swords Dance even after Disguise has been exhausted. It is also able to provide Spikes support to chip down the opposing team, use Thunder Wave to cripple Mimikyu's offensive checks, and serve as a Mega Scizor check using Foul Play. Tapu Koko is a potent special attacker that can punch holes through teams and take care of walls that Mimikyu otherwise has trouble with, such as Toxapex and Skarmory. Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu is a frightening physical attacker that complements Mimikyu as a revenge killer for threats such as Landorus and Mega Charizard Y. Tapu Bulu also puts pressure on bulky Water- and Ground-types that Mimikyu struggles with, such as Hippowdon and Swampert. Ribombee provides Sticky Web for Mimikyu, allowing it to outspeed key threats such as Mega Lopunny. Belly Drum Azumarill is an exceptionally dangerous setup sweeper that can serve as a complementary cleaner alongside Mimikyu and help tremendously in the Steel matchup, where Mimikyu struggles.</p> "

  "Kommo-o": {
    "overview": "<h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Kommo-o is one of Dragon's best setup sweepers due to its custom omni-boosting Z-Move Clangorous Soulblaze, great STAB combination in Dragon and Fighting, and very solid coverage options, which is especially helpful against types that Dragon would normally struggle breaking, such as Normal, Steel, Rock, and Ice. Because Kommo-o has such an expansive movepool, it can function as either a physical or special setup sweeper, making its moveset harder to predict at Team Preview. Kommo-o's defensive stats are just as solid as its offensive stats, often allowing it to take most hits before proceeding to use its Z-Move against teams that lack a Fairy-type Pokemon. It can usually set up on slower presences on types like Fire, Steel, and Bug, with examples being Heatran and Armaldo, respectively. With a Fighting-type STAB move in Close Combat, Kommo-o assists Dragon in breaking past bulkier cores such as Chansey + Porygon2, which is rather handy considering that Dragon teams do not have a Knock Off user that can remove the Eviolites from both of them. Solid coverage options like Flash Cannon, Flamethrower, and Poison Jab help in checking Fairy- and Steel-types that Dragon-types would normally struggle to break, like Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Mega Scizor. Kommo-o's unique typing provides extra resistances to Bug- and Rock-type moves, as no other Dragon-type resists Bug-type moves such as Scizor's U-turn, and Garchomp is the only Dragon-type besides Kommo-o that resists Rock-type moves, like Tyranitar's Stone Edge. Its access to Taunt can prevent Haze, phazing, and status from hampering its ability to sweep. However, Kommo-o's unique typing, while beneficial, also makes it weak to more common typings in the tier such as Fairy and Psychic, which comes with offensive threats like Mew, Mega Diancie, and Mega Gardevoir. Fairy-types in general hinder Kommo-o in the sense that they resist or are immune to both of its STAB types, prevent Kommo-o from using its custom Z-Move, and can all OHKO Kommo-o if they have a STAB move. Furthermore, Kommo-o's Speed is rather lackluster compared to most other Dragon-types, at base 85, leaving Kommo-o vulnerable to faster setup sweepers like Porygon-Z and Mega Charizard X before a Speed boost and Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Latios after. Because Kommo-o heavily relies on its Z-Move to act as a setup sweeper, it rarely uses any other item besides Kommonium Z.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Kommo-o is a great offensive Pokemon on Fighting teams thanks to its access to a unique Z-Move in Clangorous Soulblaze, boosting all of its stats by 1 while simultaneously dealing great damage to the majority of the metagame. In addition to this, Kommo-o boasts a great secondary Dragon typing with useful resistances to types like Fire and Grass, giving it the ability to check many dangerous offensive Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Bulu, while its above-average bulk and set of resistances allow it to set up on a wide range of defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos. Kommo-o also has access to decent utility options, most notably Taunt, which specifically allows Kommo-o to stop Haze users such as Toxapex and Mantine from clearing its stat boosts and recovering HP, preventing them from checking it. Despite this, Clangorous Soulblaze is quite risky and situational due to the prevalence of Fairy-types that can switch in on it and waste it. Furthermore, it is one-time use, meaning Kommo-o only has a single opportunity to set up and sweep throughout the game, which is made worse by the fact that Kommo-o's lacking offensive stats leave it heavily dependent on its Z-Move in order to deal significant damage. Kommo-o is also outsped by many offensive Pokemon and common Choice Scarf users such as Latios even after a boost. Additionally, Kommo-o's typing leaves it with a quadruple weakness to common Fairy-types that can constantly pressure Kommo-o with their STAB moves and switch into its Z-Move with ease. Other weaknesses to common types such as Dragon and Ice limit its setup capabilities, as faster Pokemon such as Latios and Kyurem-B can always force it out with their STAB moves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Earthquake on mixed Kommo-o is an option that would be used in tandem with Close Combat and Flamethrower to very heavily pressure Steel teams. It also checks Toxapex in a one-on-one scenario, but this isn't as necessary considering that teammates like Latios, Kyurem-B, and Garchomp work as fine checks in their own right. Additionally, the combination of Scald burns and Haze eliminate any chances Kommo-o would have of breaking Toxapex with Earthquake at all. Drain Punch can act as a substitute to Close Combat on Dragon Dance variants of Kommo-o, as it exchanges power for reliable recovery without dropping its defenses. However, Drain Punch misses out on more potential 2HKOs, namely Porygon2 and Celesteela, due to its severe drop in power compared to Close Combat. Bulletproof can be used over Soundproof as a bluffing option, which would lure in opposing Ditto looking to block Clanging Scales or Clangorous Soulblaze, while also providing extra niche immunities to specific moves such as Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball. However, these extra immunities aren't as valuable compared to what Soundproof offers, and they enable opposing Kommo-o and Ditto to take advantage of the lack of Soundproof once discovered.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Soundproof can be used over Bulletproof in order to have a better matchup against Ditto and opposing Kommo-o, but this comes at the cost of its matchup against more important Pokemon like Mega Venusaur. A physical set consisting of Dragon Dance, Close Combat, Poison Jab, and Clanging Scales can turn Kommo-o into a decent physical setup sweeper in tandem with Clangorous Soulblaze, but this set cannot check Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur nearly as well due to the lack of Taunt.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Dragon</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Tapu Koko and Mega Diancie can outspeed Kommo-o prior to it boosting with either Dragon Dance or Clangorous Soulblaze and immediately OHKO it while being immune to its Z-Move. Likewise, bulkier Fairy-types such as Klefki can also take advantage of Kommo-o by setting up dual screens and entry hazards or crippling it with Thunder Wave or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mimikyu: Mimikyu is especially threatening, as its unique typing makes it immune to both of Kommo-o's STAB moves, it protects itself from one offensive move due to Disguise, and it will immediately OHKO Kommo-o with Play Rough even through a Defense boost.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers</strong>: Common Haze users like Toxapex and Mantine as well as bulky Whirlwind users like Hippowdon and Skarmory  can force Kommo-o out, causing it to lose its stat boosts and softening its offensive pressure.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types like Alakazam, Latios, Latias, and Mega Gallade can take advantage of Kommo-o's lower Speed and heavily damage or even KO it with powerful Psychic moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Latios, opposing Dragon-types such as Mega Altaria and Hydreigon, or other setup sweepers like Mega Charizard X, Flyinium Z Landorus-T, and Mewnium Z Mew can threaten Kommo-o once they are set up. However, the latter usually must set up first before attacking and does not appreciate being hit by Kommo-o's powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status and Residual Damage: Status conditions such as paralysis and burns greatly inhibit Kommo-o's ability to act as a setup sweeper, so avoid bulkier foes or Prankster users that can inflict these conditions, such as Sableye and Klefki. Also, any bit of residual damage from entry hazards or status set a timer on Kommo-o, and it must stay healthy in order to have the best possible chances at sweeping teams.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Nearly any Fairy-type such as Mega Diancie or Mimikyu can take advantage of Kommo-o's quadruple weakness and prevent it from using its Z-Move, constantly pressuring it.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Kommo-o lacks the Speed to outspeed most opposing Dragon-types, which can almost always OHKO it. Once boosted, it is still threatened by Choice Scarf users such as Latios.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Kommo-o lacks the power to break past Psychic-types such as Mew and Mega Gallade, which can proceed to KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Although its bulk is quite impressive once boosted, Kommo-o's average Speed and dependence on moves that lower its defenses allow faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Greninja to beat it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Kommo-o dislikes all forms of status. Paralysis can cripple its Speed stat while poison or burn can quickly wear it down throughout the match.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Clanging Scales is Kommo-o's strongest STAB move and allows it to unleash Clangorous Soulblaze. After the omniboost, Clanging Scales becomes a much more potent threat that is capable of breaking down many walls such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur with ease. Additionally, its sound-based properties allow it to damage Pokemon such as Suicune through their Substitutes. Drain Punch enables Kommo-o to recover its health as well as threaten Normal- and Steel-types such as Chansey and Heatran. Flamethrower is great coverage against Steel-types such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor that are neutral to Kommo-o's Fighting-type STAB moves. Taunt prevents foes such as Hippowdon and Toxapex from removing its stat boosts through phazing or Haze.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed when paired with a Naive nature allows Kommo-o to hit as hard and fast as possible. At +1 Speed, Kommo-o can outspeed foes such as Mega Lopunny and Zeraora. Soundproof is used to prevent opposing Kommo-o from using Clangorous Soulblaze themselves, as well as Ditto from utilizing Clanging Scales after copying Kommo-o's boosts. It also has smaller merits by making Kommo-o immune to Azumarill's Perish Song and Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice. Kommonium Z is used in combination with Clanging Scales in order to use Kommo-o's exclusive Z-Move, Clangorous Soulblaze.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kommo-o should only use Clangorous Soulblaze in safe situations, such as on a guaranteed KO or a forced switch. For example, the latter situation can occur when it safely switches into moves that it resists, such as against Victini Choice-locked into V-create. Preserving Kommo-o is key versus Steel teams, a type that Dragon teams would traditionally struggle with, as the combination of Clangorous Soulblaze, Drain Punch, and Flamethrower may outright sweep them under the right conditions. It should also be kept healthy versus opposing Dragon teams, as Kommo-o can halt opposing Kommo-o from using Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soulblaze through Soundproof while also being able to set up and sweep them if they lack Mega Altaria or Choice Scarf Latios. Avoid using Clangorous Soulblaze against Ditto, opposing Kommo-o, or Fairy-types, as they can block the attack through their attained Soundproof or their Dragon immunity. While Clanging Scales is a powerful move, keep in mind the Defense drops Kommo-o will get, as too many drops can grant physical priority users such as Dragonite and Weavile opportunities to chip away at its health. Against Haze users and phazers such as Mantine and Hippowdon, Kommo-o should use Taunt first to ensure that it doesn't lose its omniboost. However, be mindful of Z-Haze Toxapex in particular, which can prevent Kommo-o from utilizing its omniboost regardless of if it's Taunted. Because Kommo-o serves as a powerful setup sweeper, it should be preserved as much as possible in order to successfully sweep teams. It should also avoid status at all costs, especially paralysis, as this severely hampers its ability to function as a setup sweeper. Using Taunt against known status inducers such as Jirachi and Porygon2 helps to shut them down.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kyurem-B assists Kommo-o by checking opposing Dragon-types such as Mega Altaria and Dragonite, checking other threatening foes such as Azumarill, and providing it with an Ice-type neutrality, which helps against foes such as Greninja and Nidoking. Dragonite uses its powerful offensive coverage to blow past common defensive walls such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, and it can also threaten to finish off faster foes with Extreme Speed such as Greninja and Mega Lopunny for unboosted Kommo-o. Choice Scarf Latios partners well with Kommo-o by checking faster Pokemon such as Greninja and Kyurem-B. It also has additional utility as a consistent Defogger, which helps to prevent entry hazards from chipping away Kommo-o, and can utilize Trick to cripple bulkier foes such as Porygon2 and Zapdos, which permits Kommo-o to set up and sweep more easily. Choice Scarf Latias can be used as an alternative for Latios by acting as a bulkier Defogger and carrying better utility options in general. In return, Kommo-o provides the ability to heavily threaten Steel-types, which Latias greatly appreciates. Garchomp provides Stealth Rock support and chips away at foes such as Dragonite and Gyarados, putting them in range of Kommo-o's attacks. Mega Altaria is a critical teammate against opposing Dragon teams, as it becomes immune to Dragon-type moves upon Mega Evolving and can threaten them through its Pixilate-boosted attacks, and it can also take on Kommo-o's other checks such as Mega Gallade. Additionally, it can also be a utility teammate through the use of Defog and Heal Bell, which can grant Kommo-o safer opportunities to set up. Hydreigon helps Kommo-o against Psychic teams that would otherwise threaten it, whether it be through firing off Dark Pulse or pivoting out with U-turn to keep up offensive momentum. Dragalge, while a niche pick, assists Kommo-o by providing coverage against threatening Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko and setting Toxic Spikes to help against bulkier foes such as Azumarill and Porygon2.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance (Dragon)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Clanging Scales is used to gain the stat boosts from Clangorous Soulblaze. Its solid special power also allows it to break down physically defensive foes such as Avalugg, Pelipper, and Landorus-T. Dragon Dance amplifies Kommo-o's offensive presence by boosting both its Attack and Speed stats. Boosting both of these stats not only allows Kommo-o to function better as a setup sweeper without having to utilize Clangorous Soulblaze prematurely but can also help to check offensive threats like Greninja, which would be harder to handle otherwise. Close Combat is Kommo-o's best physical STAB move, being able to break down bulky walls such as Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Cradily. Earthquake acts as a coverage option against other foes that don't resist it, namely Victini, Jirachi, Klefki, and Toxapex. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types that resist both of Kommo-o's STAB moves, namely Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Azumarill.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack allows Kommo-o to maximize its physical power at base value. Maximum investment in Speed paired with a Naive nature allow Kommo-o to Speed tie with other base 85 Speed foes, such as Nidoking and Heracross, and to outspeed Mega Lopunny and Mega Alakazam at +1. Kommonium Z is required in order to use Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows Kommo-o to receive its stat boosts. Soundproof is used primarily to prevent opposing Kommo-o from using Clangorous Soulblaze and also prevent Ditto from utilizing Clanging Scales after copying Kommo-o's boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Kommo-o primarily assists Dragon teams against Normal teams, as its Fighting-type STAB move is extremely beneficial for breaking down Normal teams' notorious defensive backbone. In these cases, use Dragon Dance in the face of Chansey, as it forces the opponent into a defensive option while also providing Kommo-o with a free turn of setup. Never use Clangorous Soulblaze too early unless the matchup is heavily skewed in Dragon's favor, such as against Fire and Grass teams. Otherwise, you must find opportunities to use Clangorous Soulblaze safely, such as when the foe is weakened or Choice-locked into a move that Kommo-o resists. Instances of these cases include using Clangorous Soulblaze on Greninja that's Choice-locked into Dark Pulse or Victini that's Choice-locked into V-create. Avoid using Clangorous Soulblaze against opposing Kommo-o and Ditto, as they become immune to it because of Soundproof, and in turn, Kommo-o won't receive stat boosts. Also, avoid using the Z-Move against healthy Fairy-types, such as Tapu Bulu on Grass and Mimikyu on Ghost, as they can easily switch into the move and prevent any potential stat boost. Use Dragon Dance in situations where Kommo-o faces a Pokemon with mainly utility options, such as Ferrothorn or Forretress. These kinds of foes typically do not run a status-inducing move and therefore make it safer to apply offensive pressure to the foes while taking minimal damage from their attacks. Physical Kommo-o can't take a chance at sweeping teams if it is statused, so avoid taking hits that could inflict those conditions, such as Scald, Discharge, and Sludge Bomb. By removing foes such as Mega Pinsir on Bug teams, Toxapex and Mantine on Water teams, and Ditto and Staraptor on Normal teams, it becomes much easier for Kommo-o to act as a very deadly late-game sweeper through setting up with Dragon Dance or utilizing its Z-Move, as the opponent would have no clear way to prevent it at this point.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Latias is a fantastic partner for Kommo-o, being able to Defog entry hazards away and provide Healing Wish support to give Kommo-o a second chance at sweeping teams if it ever is weakened. Mega Latias overall has great bulk that it can use to sponge hits for Kommo-o and can also recover off the damage through Roost. Latios provides similar assistance by also removing hazards with Defog. Unlike Latias, however, Latios takes a more offensive approach to Kommo-o's setup by hindering walls and utility Pokemon with Trick and also using Memento on offensive powerhouses such as Excadrill and Blacephalon, decreasing the damage Kommo-o takes and enabling Kommo-o to set up more reliably while also threatening to remove an offensive presence. Kyurem-B offers a neutrality to Ice that all Dragon-types appreciate and also threatens physically defensive foes that Kommo-o can't break as easily, such as Skarmory and Zapdos. Hydreigon checks offensive Psychic-types that would otherwise threaten Kommo-o, such as Mew and Alakazam. Garchomp provides Stealth Rock support that breaks Sturdy and Focus Sashes on Pokemon like Skarmory, Gengar, and Dugtrio and provides valuable chip damage against foes that typically don't utilize a recovery option, such as Dragonite and Gyarados. Stealth Rock also provides residual damage that can put foes in range of a KO from Kommo-o, which is especially useful in late-game scenarios. Mega Altaria provides a Dragon immunity with its additional Fairy typing and can force Choice-locked Dragon-types like Latios and Hydreigon out.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Clanging Scales is Kommo-o's most powerful and spammable move and allows it to use Clangorous Soulblaze, denting the majority of Pokemon that do not resist it and boosting all of Kommo-o's stats. Flamethrower rounds out the coverage very well, as it can hit Steel-types such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor as well as certain Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Klefki, which all wall Kommo-o otherwise. Taunt shuts down more passive Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon by preventing them from recovering HP, spreading status, and neutralizing Kommo-o with Haze and phazing moves. Close Combat's main use is for breaking past specially defensive Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Chansey that would otherwise wall Kommo-o. Earthquake can be used over Close Combat in order to hit Electric-types such as Tapu Koko while still hitting key targets like Alolan Muk and Heatran for super effective damage. Lastly, Drain Punch is another viable alternative over Close Combat that increases Kommo-o's longevity against walls like Chansey in tandem with Taunt.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Speed alongside a Naive nature maximizes Kommo-o's Speed stat in order to outspeed as much of the metagame as possible without sacrificing its damage output. The rest is invested into Special Attack in order for Kommo-o to fulfill its role as a specially biased mixed sweeper. Bulletproof gives Kommo-o a far easier matchup against Mega Venusaur when combined with Taunt by making it immune to Sludge Bomb and also allows it to pressure certain Pokemon such as Blacephalon. Kommonium Z is required in order to give Kommo-o access to Clangorous Soulblaze.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While Kommo-o can be a very dangerous late-game sweeper with Clangorous Soulblaze, it is extremely important to be selective when deciding when to set up, since it only works once throughout the game. Specifically watch out for potential Fairy-types, as they can waste its Z-Move and proceed to check it with their STAB moves. However, Kommo-o can switch in on certain Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu, giving it some use in the matchup. Use Clangorous Soulblaze once all of its checks and counters such as Mega Diancie and Latios have been weakened or KOed in order for Kommo-o to effectively sweep later in the game. Kommo-o serves as a great answer to problematic Poison-types like Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, so it is recommended to safely bring it out on these Pokemon in order for its teammates to have an easier time later on. Use Taunt when expecting a potential Haze from Mantine and other problematic status moves like Leech Seed from Mega Venusaur before attempting to set up. Kommo-o should remain healthy before attempting to sweep, as it becomes far easier to revenge kill once chipped down, especially since it has no reliable way to recover HP. It is important to avoid status, as Kommo-o's Speed is crippled by paralysis and it can be easily worn down by poison and burns.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kommo-o benefits the team by providing the role of a good special setup sweeper, something Fighting usually lacks. Mega Gallade is an excellent partner for Kommo-o, as it is a great wallbreaker that can punch holes into troublesome Pokemon like Kyurem-B early-game in order to give Kommo-o a great opportunity to sweep. It also eases Kommo-o's load in the Poison matchup, serving as an additional check to Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Keldeo is another wallbreaker that aids Kommo-o in important matchups such as Ground thanks to its immediate power and coverage. Choice Scarf Terrakion offers a terrific way of keeping faster foes in check in problematic matchups like Flying, outspeeding the majority of the metagame and revenge killing many important Pokemon such as Tapu Koko while Kommo-o can pressure defensive Pokemon like Skarmory for it. Entry hazard support from Cobalion goes very well with Kommo-o's ability to force many switches and gradually wears down its checks. Cobalion also offers an important neutrality to Fairy, being able to survive attacks such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast. Additionally, its Thunder Wave support somewhat alleviates Kommo-o's mediocre Speed stat, and Volt Switch helps provide momentum. Heracross and Buzzwole both help Kommo-o with the problematic Psychic matchup due to their Bug typing, with the former being able to Pursuit trap threats and the latter sporting incredible physical bulk. Breloom can potentially give Kommo-o a safe opportunity to set up thanks to its access to Spore and provides the team with a secondary setup sweeper with Swords Dance. Kommo-o covers its Fire weakness very well in return. Hawlucha offers support by providing hazard removal while outspeeding nearly the entire metagame after an Unburden boost, allowing it to clean through faster foes such as Latios for Kommo-o.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Poison</h1> <p>Nihilego is a powerful revenge killer and sweeper available to Poison teams thanks to its solid Speed, expansive movepool, and solid Special Attack. Nihilego's already high Special Attack stat can be amplified to greater levels thanks to Beast Boost, as it becomes harder to stop with each KO it gets. Its unique speed tier allows it to outspeed and KO foes such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Victini. Nihilego's ability to use Stealth Rock is critical for chipping away at opposing pokemon, as it can reliably pick up extra KOs and gain more boost from Beast Boost as a result. It also compresses the role of a Stealth Rock setter well, as it can force many powerful threats such as Kyurem-B out. However, Nihilego's terrible defensive typing makes it susceptible to Ground-, Psychic-, Steel-, and Water-types such as Hippowdon, Mega Gallade, Jirachi, and Mega Swampert. Its Rock- and Poison-type STAB move combination also is rather poor against a majority of foes, including Heatran, Jirachi, and Gastrodon. Nihilego also must constantly run coverage moves such as Hidden Power Ice and Thunderbolt in order to check foes such as Gliscor and Toxapex. Additionally, while it has very good special bulk, Nihilego's horrendous physical bulk leaves it susceptible to many physical attackers and priority users such as Azumarill, Bisharp, Breloom, and Scizor.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>With its powerful offenses, diverse coverage options, and unique defensive utility, Nihilego is one of Rock's strongest special attackers. Access to valuable coverage moves like Thunderbolt and Grass Knot allows Nihilego to put heavy pressure on the Water and Ground teams that Rock can struggle with. Thanks to these coverage moves and its good Speed tier, Nihilego can outrun and check key threats such as Garchomp and Landorus. Nihilego's Speed tier also lets it clean through weakened teams in conjunction with Beast Boost. Furthermore, its Poison typing offers valuable neutralities to Fighting- and Grass-type moves, which Rock is weak to, as well as a means of removing Toxic Spikes, and its high Special Defense lets it serve as a check for special attackers such as Alolan Raichu and Greninja, especially with sand support. However, Nihilego's middling Defense leaves it vulnerable to many physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and many common priority users such as Azumarill and Scizor, and despite its good Speed, Nihilego is still outsped by key threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo that threaten Rock as a whole. While Nihilego has a deep movepool, it is not able to cover everything with four moveslots and will always have a gap in its coverage opponents can exploit.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Poison</h1> <p>Grass Knot allows Nihilego to hit Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Mega Swampert that it tends to lure in, dealing incredible damage to them. However, Grass Knot isn't useful in any other matchup, as its mechanics constantly alter the move's power. An Air Balloon can be utilized over a Choice Scarf to circumvent Nihilego's weakness to Ground-type attacks. However, Nihilego must avoid being damaged to do so, which is rather difficult to do. Additionally, the lack of a Choice Scarf means that foes such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outspeed and revenge kill it. Nihilego can also utilize a Z-Crystal; most notably, it can utilize Electrium Z to lure and KO defensive countermeasures such as Celesteela and Toxapex.</p> <h1>Rock</h1> <p>An Expert Belt is an option over Life Orb, which allows Nihilego to make use of its expansive coverage without having to worry about recoil, at the cost of only boosting damage against Pokemon it can hit with super effective moves.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Poison</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Nihilego can hardly do anything against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Jirachi, as they resist its Rock-type STAB moves and are immune to Poison.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon resist both of Nihilego's STAB moves and can OHKO it in return with a Ground-type move.

Thunderbolt is another coverage move that targets Water-types such as Keldeo and Toxapex, while also targeting Flying-types such as Celesteela that take neutral damage from Power Gem and Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ice is used as coverage against Dragon- and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus. Stealth Rock can be compressed onto Nihilego to allow its teammate in Nidoking to utilize an extra coverage move such as Thunderbolt. Sludge Wave is used to check Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Koko, and also comes with the benefit of potentially poisoning the foe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed Investment with a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf makes Nihilego as fast as possible. Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Nihilego's power, which is important when considering that Beast Boost amplifies its Special Attack every time it nets a KO.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set makes Nihilego a potent revenge killer, so try to bring it in against weakened foes. With Beast Boost amplifying its Special Attack, it becomes harder to switch into defensively upon netting. Nihilego can also act as a late-game sweeper if the foes have been sufficiently weakened. Nihilego can be used to deter certain setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade and Volcarona by switching into them on predicted setup moves. However, Nihilego shouldn't do this frivolously, and it should never be immediately switched into physical moves, as its low physical bulk leaves it to be KOed by foes on the spot. Nihilego should avoid paralysis, as a halved Speed stat will prevent it from performing its roles as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper. It's important to know when to utilize Stealth Rock. Nihilego should attempt to get Stealth Rock up against foes that it can threaten to KO, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Aerodactyl, as it forces them out. However, Nihilego is forced to immediately switch out after setting it up, as being locked into Stealth Rock renders Nihilego useless and can allow foes such as Jirachi, Kommo-o, and Mega Latias to set up and potentially sweep. Nihilego is also critical in the fight against Flying teams; while there are a few Flying-types that can switch into its attacks, none of them can revenge kill it when it's equipped with its Choice Scarf.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur is a key teammate for Nihilego, as its typing provides a useful Ground-type neutrality and Water-type resistance for Pokemon that Nihilego struggles against. Additionally, Mega Venusaur can also utilize Leech Seed against utility foes such as Chansey and switch into Nihilego to provide it with passive recovery. Toxapex pairs up nicely with Nihilego, as its incredible defenses, typing, and recovery are vital against many foes such as Greninja and Mega Scizor. Additionally, Nihilego benefits from Toxapex, as it can use Scald to burn physical attackers looking to capitalize on Nihilego's poor physical bulk. Nidoking has a strong combination of Sheer Force and a Life Orb that can sufficiently threaten foes Nihilego wouldn't be able to, such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Crobat provides solid utility for Nihilego by utilizing Defog to remove entry hazards and Taunt to prevent recovery from foes such as Porygon2 and Hippowdon. Thanks to its Flying typing, Crobat can circumvent Nihilego's weakness to Ground-type moves by acting as a Ground-immune Pokemon. Alolan Muk assists Nihilego as a Psychic-immune Pokemon, being able to threaten foes such as Latios and Mega Latias by Pursuit trapping them. Additionally, its Knock Off is beneficial for removing Eviolite from Chansey and Porygon2, enabling Nihilego to threaten these foes more effectively. SubToxic Salazzle also benefits Nihilego, as its ability in Corrosion means that it can Poison problematic Poison- and Steel-types such as Toxapex and Celesteela, foes that Nihilego cannot effectively KO unless they're relatively weakened.</p> "

Take advantage of Nihilego's high Special Defense to switch into weak special attacks and position it against walls it can break such as Mega Venusaur or and Zapdos. Nihilego's Poison typing can be used to tank Grass- and Fighting-type attacks, as well as to absorb Toxic and Toxic Spikes for the team. Nihilego can even stomach Scald from bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Suicune. Keep Nihilego's Special Attack boosts in mind as well, as a single boost can be enough to keep one of its usual checks, such as a healthy Hippowdon, from handling it. However, Nihilego can also be preserved as a check for special attackers such as Alolan Raichu and Greninja, especially when supported with sand.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle offers valuable entry hazard support with Sticky Web, which lets Nihilego outspeed a much broader range of offensive threats such as Keldeo, Greninja, and Tapu Koko. Terrakion serves as an excellent revenge killer with Choice Scarf to complement Nihilego's wallbreaking, and it helps in the Steel and Normal matchups that Nihilego is largely useless in. Tyranitar works as a fantastic physical wallbreaker to punch through special walls that Nihilego cannot touch such as Chansey and Mew, and it can Pursuit trap the Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Nihilego. Mega Diancie is an excellent mixed attacker that puts pressure in the Dark, Dragon, and Fighting matchups where Nihilego can struggle. Alolan Golem and Rhyperior serve as effective checks to Mega Scizor, which otherwise sets up freely on Nihilego. Alolan Golem can also trap other pesky Steel-types that wall Nihilego such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela. Cradily can help support Nihilego in the Water matchup with its immunity to Water-type moves and appreciates Nihilego's capacity to absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> "

Hidden Power Ice is excellent coverage for hitting Ground- and Dragon- types, and it is necessary to check threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Steel-types resistant to Nihilego's other attacks such as Celesteela and Skarmory. Power Gem is a reliable Rock-type STAB move that hits targets resistant to Sludge Wave. Toxic Spikes can be used over Power Gem to help whittle down bulkier teams with chip damage, especially Normal and Water.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Nihilego uses maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf to outrun threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to make Nihilego as strong as possible. Beast Boost is Nihilego's only ability, boosting its Special Attack whenever it KOes a foe. Combined with Choice Scarf, this gives Nihilego the potential to clean late-game against types such as Water and Dragon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Nihilego should be used to check threats to Rock such as Garchomp and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu, as well as other offensive Pokemon. Since Nihilego is easily walled by most defensive Pokemon when locked into an attack, be aggressive with double switches to bring teammates in against walls. You can also take advantage of forced switches as an opportunity to set Toxic Spikes. This should be prioritized against bulkier teams like Normal, where the extra chip damage is important for wearing down Chansey and Porygon2. You may also want to preserve Nihilego as a check to special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Greninja with its tremendous special bulk. You should take care to keep Nihilego healthy in matchups where it is needed to absorb Toxic Spikes, such as against Water or Poison teams. Keep an eye on opportunities late-game to clean weakened teams using Beast Boost's Special Attack boosts.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Shuckle offers valuable entry hazard support with Stealth Rock, which can whittle down Nihilego's checks so it can clean late-game, and Sticky Web, which lets Nihilego outrun faster revenge killers like Choice Scarf Keldeo and Choice Scarf Greninja. With Nihilego serving as Rock's revenge killer, Terrakion can serve as the team's wallbreaker or sweeper with a Choice Band or Swords Dance set. Tyranitar can break special walls such as Alolan Muk and Chansey that Nihilego cannot touch and Pursuit trap Nihilego's Psychic-type checks such as Latios. Mega Diancie serves as a dangerous mixed attacker that supports Nihilego in the Dark, Dragon, and Fighting matchups. Alolan Golem and Rhyperior can be used to check Mega Scizor and put pressure on Steel-type teams that Nihilego cannot threaten. Alolan Golem can also trap Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela.

  "Buzzwole": {
    "overview": "<h1>Bug</h1> <p>Due to its good physical bulk, Buzzwole is a big threat to Dragon-type teams, taking out threatening Pokemon, such as Dragonite and Kyurem-B, with Ice Punch and Superpower. Buzzwole is primarily used as a Choice Scarf user on Bug teams, allowing it to deal with problematic Fire- and Rock-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Terrakion. Buzzwole's ability Beast Boost, along with a massive base 139 Attack stat, makes it a threatening revenge killer, boosting its Attack after it knocks out a Pokemon. Its part Fighting typing makes it neutral to Rock-type attacks, and this paired with its good physical bulk means it is able to tank attacks such as Stone Edge from the likes of Terrakion and Mega Tyranitar, which can only 3HKO and 2HKO it, respectively. However, Buzzwole’s low Special Defense means it is easily threatened by special attackers and has almost no opportunities to switch into them, as it risks getting 2HKOed even by attacks that it resists. It is generally overshadowed by Heracross on Bug-type teams, as Heracross has access to better STAB moves in Close Combat and Megahorn, a higher Speed stat, and a similar ability to Beast Boost, Moxie. However, Buzzwole has much greater physical bulk than Heracross, surviving a +6 Aqua Jet at full health from Azumarill. It also pressures Dragon-type teams, a troublesome matchup for Bug. Its mediocre Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users, such as Latios and Victini. Buzzwole's part Fighting typing is a disadvantage for it in matchups against Psychic teams, as Buzzwole often does not run Bug-type moves, so it struggles to break past Pokemon such as Slowbro and defensive Mew.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Buzzwole is one of Fighting's best revenge killers, as it can effectively KO Dragon-types and sweep weakened teams with its STAB combination. Buzzwole's high Attack stat and Bug-type STAB move in Leech Life allow it to hit Psychic-types like Latios and Celebi for heavy damage, which Fighting teams tend to struggle with. Its access to Ice- and Poison-type coverage also benefits the team, as it can help get rid of Flying-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu, respectively. Buzzwole sports respectable physical bulk, which allows it to check physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Belly Drum Azumarill. Despite this, Buzzwole is still somewhat inferior to Heracross because of the former's lower Speed, as it misses out on outspeeding some crucial Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Togekiss and +1 Gyarados. Heracross also has more effective STAB moves that allow it to offensively pressure opposing teams more, as well as the ability to Pursuit trap Pokemon like Victini after a V-create. Buzzwole is also very vulnerable to special attackers, as its Special Defense stat is very low, so Pokemon like Keldeo and Hydreigon can easily revenge kill it. Like many other Fighting-types, Buzzwole is very vulnerable to status ailments, as burns cut its revenge killing power in half and paralysis slows it down significantly, preventing it from outspeeding threats to the team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p>Poison Jab can be used to deal with Fairy-types like Azumarill; however, it is situational and outclassed by other moves on the set due to better coverage. A Choice Band set can be used as a wallbreaker to open up big holes for teammates, but it is put at risk by common threats due to its mediocre Speed stat. A stallbreaker set with Taunt can be used to have an easier time dealing with walls, as it prevents them from setting up or using recovery moves.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Buzzwole can run a wallbreaker set that uses Substitute and Focus Punch in combination with Fightinium Z to take down walls like Celesteela, but this allows Buzzwole to be revenge killed by many Pokemon because it is now heavily outsped by most of the metagame. Keldeo also does this more efficiently with Choice Specs and its STAB combination.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Bug</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Latios and Victini, can easily take out Buzzwole with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Buzzwole finds it hard to get past physical walls, such as Skarmory, Celesteela, Slowbro, and even bulky Mew if Buzzwole is lacking Leech Life.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye easily checks Buzzwole, as it is immune to Superpower and can burn Buzzwole with Will-O-Wisp, rendering Buzzwole useless.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, notably Clefable, have little to fear from Buzzwole, since Clefable has good bulk and can recover off the damage with Soft-Boiled and proceed to take out Buzzwole with its STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Due to its poor Special Defense, Buzzwole is easily threatened by most special attackers and risks getting severely weakened or knocked out.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Buzzwole is easily checked by Mega Venusaur, as it can tank hits due to its solid bulk and heal with Synthesis. It can wear down Buzzwole with Leech Seed and Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Staraptor all completely wall Buzzwole's attacks and can phaze it, recover any lost health, or wear it down with their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mimikyu are resistant or immune to both of Buzzwole's STAB attacks, which allows them to safely KO Buzzwole in return with their STAB attacks.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Superpower is the strongest STAB move on the set, severely denting neutral targets and dealing with the problematic Steel- and Rock-types for Bug teams. Ice Punch allows Buzzwole to pressure Dragon-type teams, as Bug otherwise lacks access to Ice-type moves and struggles to deal with Dragon-type teams offensively. Ice Punch, when combined with Superpower, allows Buzzwole to threaten Dragon, as Kyurem-B fears Superpower, which makes the rest of the team vulnerable to Ice Punch. It can also deal with Ground-types, such as Landorus and Gliscor. Stone Edge is important in order to deal with Flying- and Fire-type threats, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mantine, and Volcarona, all of which are huge threats to Bug-type teams. Earthquake allows Buzzwole to deal with Rock- and Poison-types like Mega Diancie and Toxapex. It also has amazing coverage with Stone Edge, forming the EdgeQuake combination that hits a lot of types for super effective damage. Leech Life gives Buzzwole some recovery and a reliable Bug-type STAB move that can pressure opposing Psychic-type teams; however, Buzzwole has to forgo important offensive coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment optimizes Buzzwole's overall damage output. Maximum Speed investment, along with a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf, allows Buzzwole to deal with threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Koko, and Mega Diancie, be an effective revenge killer and check to threats to Bug-type teams. Its ability Beast Boost allows it to get an Attack boost after each Pokemon it KOes. This not only makes Buzzwole difficult to stop defensively, but it is especially helpful when using Superpower, as Beast Boost negates the drop in Attack after it manages to get a KO.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its typing, Buzzwole has key resistances to Ground-, Dark-, and Fighting-type attacks, which grants it some opportunities to switch in. Smart double switches and U-turn pivots from the likes of Scizor allow Buzzwole to come in safely to revenge kill threats without taking unnecessary damage. Proper predictions should be made, as locking Buzzwole into a certain move can allow opposing Pokemon to set up freely; for example, Ground teams can predict Ice Punch, switching into Seismitoad or Mamoswine and sacrificing Buzzwole’s momentum. Status moves, such as moves that inflict paralysis and burns, should be avoided at all costs, as they make Buzzwole unable to revenge kill threats that it is supposed to. Due to its low special bulk, Buzzwole should not be switched in on special moves, as even weak special attacks can easily 2HKO it. Even though Buzzwole has good physical bulk, it shouldn't switch into physical attacks often to remain healthy, especially if it is needed to revenge kill a certain threat for the team. Superpower lowers Buzzwole's Attack and Defense stats by one stage, so it should be used cautiously, because it forces Buzzwole out and can let a foe set up; the lowered Defense also makes Buzzwole more prone to being revenge killed. However, its ability Beast Boost negates the Attack drop after it knocks out a Pokemon. One should be cautious of switching Buzzwole into certain Pokemon like Garchomp, which potentially carry a coverage move such as Fire Blast, weakening Buzzwole. As Buzzwole is an asset against Dragon-type teams, it should be preserved to revenge kill threats such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B. Buzzwole can easily tank Extreme Speed from Choice Band Dragonite due to its high physical bulk, and it can also score an OHKO with Ice Punch if Multiscale is no longer in effect. Scizor should be preserved, as it can Pursuit trap Choice Scarf Latios.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Galvantula makes for a fantastic teammate, as it not only provides Sticky Web support for Buzzwole but also deals with bulky Water-types that trouble it, since Galvantula has access to Thunder and Energy Ball. Choice Band Scizor is a good teammate, bringing Buzzwole in safely with U-turn while also providing the team with priority Bullet Punch to deal with threats like Mega Diancie, Nihilego, and Terrakion. Scizor can also provide Pursuit support to trap and take out troublesome Pokemon for Buzzwole, such as Latios and Victini. Mega Scizor is another good teammate for Buzzwole, as it appreciates Buzzwole covering threats for it, such as Mega Charizard Y. Mega Scizor can pressure and break down common checks as well as act as a sweeper by setting up Swords Dance. Volcarona deals with physical walls that Buzzwole has a hard time breaking, such as Celesteela and Skarmory, while Buzzwole takes care of special walls like Chansey for Volcarona to sweep more easily. Armaldo and Forretress are good teammates because both provide Rapid Spin support, since Buzzwole is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards. They also provide Buzzwole with Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, which makes cleaning teams easier for Buzzwole. Armaldo also provides Buzzwole with Knock Off support, which allows Buzzwole to deal with Pokemon such as defensive Staraptor and Toxapex much more easily. Mega Pinsir is another good teammate, as it can wallbreak with Swords Dance, which pressures common checks and opens up walls for Buzzwole. Araquanid provides Buzzwole with good defensive support with Assault Vest to sponge strong special attacks, such as Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y, which threaten Buzzwole. It is also a good status absorber for Buzzwole, as Water Bubble makes it immune to burns. Due to its ability Speed Boost, Scolipede can function quite effectively even without Sticky Web support, outspeeding threatening Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini, which Choice Scarf Buzzwole cannot outspeed. Scolipede also puts in a lot of work against Psychic-type teams with Megahorn.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Life is Buzzwole's most consistent STAB attack and allows it to hit Psychic- and Grass-types like Latias and Serperior for good damage. Leech Life also provides Buzzwole with a minor form of recovery. Superpower is Buzzwole's most powerful STAB attack and allows it to hit Normal- and Steel-types like Porygon2 and Excadrill. Ice Punch allows Buzzwole to hit defensive Ground- and Flying-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T that would otherwise wall the other physical attackers on the team. It is also useful coverage, as it hits Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp very hard. Poison Jab allows Buzzwole to check Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Azumarill, which otherwise threaten the rest of the team. Earthquake can be used over Poison Jab to revenge kill Victini after a V-create as well as KO Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Buzzwole to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment paired with a Jolly nature and further augmented by a Choice Scarf allows Buzzwole to outspeed threats such as Latios and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Beast Boost enables Buzzwole to break down teams by getting an Attack boost after KOing a Pokemon, which can be useful for evening out Superpower's Attack drop when sweeping.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Buzzwole is used best as a revenge killer, so switching it into Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Latios after a teammate has fallen allows Buzzwole to force them out or KO them. Buzzwole can also sweep teams effectively if opposing walls like Toxapex and Mega Sableye are gone, with Beast Boost making this easier by increasing Buzzwole's Attack after every consecutive KO. Buzzwole should avoid staying in on fast or bulky special attackers, as its low Special Defense leaves it open to many special revenge killers like Mega Diancie and Mega Slowbro. Buzzwole must be cautious about not getting Choice-locked into an unfavorable move, since Pokemon like Dragonite and Mega Altaria will take advantage of this and try to set up on Buzzwole as a result. Be wary of using Superpower continuously, as it can lead to Buzzwole becoming less and less effective due to the move lowering Buzzwole's Attack and Defense and leaving it more easily revenge killed or set up on. Buzzwole should avoid staying in on walls or any status inducers like Klefki, as they will hamper Buzzwole's effectiveness with their status moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cobalion provides Buzzwole with Stealth Rock support, which allows Buzzwole to get KOs on Focus Sash users such as Garchomp and Breloom, as well as make use of Thunder Wave to slow down fast threats like Choice Scarf Latios and Choice Scarf Greninja. Terrakion uses a Choice Scarf to act as a way to check faster threats to Fighting teams like Choice Scarf Victini and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. In return, Buzzwole can handle Terrakion's checks like Azumarill and Gliscor. Keldeo threatens physically defensive tanks that Buzzwole cannot handle like Mega Sableye and KOes them with Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump. Breloom uses Spore to put opposing Pokemon to sleep and can revenge kill faster threats to Buzzwole like Choice Scarf Greninja with Mach Punch. Breloom also uses Bullet Seed to take down bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune who that also wear down Buzzwole. Hawlucha can remove hazards like Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web, preventing Buzzwole from being worn down or slowed down when it switches in. Kommo-o appreciates Buzzwole eliminating Fairy-types like Azumarill and Tapu Bulu that block its Z-Move prior to setting up. Additionally, it can take on Pokemon that wall Buzzwole such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur with Clangorous Soulblaze and use Taunt to prevent them from healing. Mega Gallade breaks though bulky Pokemon after a Swords Dance boost with its powerful STAB moves in Zen Headbutt and Close Combat. Buzzwole appreciates its ability to eliminate Poison-types, as Buzzwole struggles to KO them.</p> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Xurkitree possesses insanely high Special Attack along with access to Tail Glow, which allows it to boost its Special Attack by three stages in a single turn.</li> <li>Its plethora of coverage moves makes it hard to wall.</li> <li>Its absurd Special Attack allows it to serve as a powerful revenge killer when equipped with a Choice Scarf.</li> <li>Xurkitree's frail bulk limits its chances of getting a Tail Glow up, as most decently strong attacks tend to do a large amount of damage.</li> <li>Furthermore, it suffers from a low Speed stat. This means that Tail Glow sets are going to be outsped and taken care of with ease by most Pokemon.</li> <li>It does, however, get access to certain Z-moves that can increase its Speed stat by one stage, including Z-Hypnosis and Z-Electric Terrain. Z-Hypnosis is more notable because of its ability to provide Xurkitree with an extra turn to set up a Tail Glow, something it really appreciates because of its poor bulk.</li> <li>This makes Xurkitree one of the only Pokemon on Electric teams that can actually boost its Speed alongside Alolan Raichu.</li> <li>However, it's impossible to fit Hypnosis, Tail Glow, Thunderbolt, and its coverage moves into one moveset. This is why most Tail Glow sets either run only one coverage move or forgo Z-Hypnosis.</li> <li>With Beast Boost raising its Special Attack every time it gets a KO, it's still a potent late-game cleaner. This works well with a way to boost Speed, such as a Z-move or Choice Scarf.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Z-Electric Terrain is an alternative Z-Move that can also raise Speed by one stage. It works much better with most Electric teams, helping out Alolan Raichu, and can also boost Xurkitree's Thunderbolt's power by 1.5x. However, it is outclassed by Z-Hypnosis due to the latter providing a free turn to set up Tail Glow if Xurkitree can manage to land it.</li> <li>Choice Specs is another strong option that takes advantage of its absurd Special Attack. It has extremely few switch-ins and provides power right off the bat unlike sets with Tail Glow. However, Electric has much better users of Choice Specs such as Alolan Raichu, and it's usually outclassed by Tail Glow sets, as they can actually switch between moves.</li> <li>Tail Glow sets with Z-Hypnosis suffer from four-moveslot syndrome greatly, only having the capability to run one coverage move. However, alternative sets can be run without a Z-Move to break through walls that take little damage from Thunderbolt and Energy Ball and improve Xurkitree's coverage. Furthermore, it allows Xurkitree to run a different item such as Focus Sash or Life Orb, which can make setting up a lot easier or allow Xurkitree to hit much harder, respectively. It's not as viable as the Z-Hypnosis set, though, as it finds it extremely tough to get an opportunity to set up against most offensive Pokemon.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-type Pokemon, most notably Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, wall Choice Scarf Xurkitree pretty easily and can switch in freely most of the time. They have a tough time facing the Z-Hypnosis set, however.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill: Choice Scarf Excadrill outspeeds all variants of Xurkitree and OHKOes it in return. It deserves a special mention, as it can switch into most of Choice Scarf Xurkitree's attacks without taking much damage.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak</strong>: Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak walls Xurkitree very easily, being immune to Electric and resisting all three of its common coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast revenge killers, typically ones with Choice Scarf, such as Victini, can outspeed and OHKO Xurkitree with ease, as it has poor bulk.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards wear down Choice Scarf Xurkitree easily because of its need to switch out constantly, as it dislikes being stuck in one move throughout the match. Furthermore, it gets no reliable recovery, so it has no way of regaining its lost health.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Xurkitree's mediocre bulk leaves it vulnerable to many priority users, including Dragonite and Bisharp.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Most walls invested in Special Defense like Chansey can wall Choice Scarf Xurkitree.

Not only does Xurkitree cause a lot of switches due to its expansive movepool, it also breaks the Focus Sash of Focus Sash users if Stealth Rock is up, making it easier to clean up.

Rotom-W and Zapdos are great switch-ins to Ground-type attacks and can provide support in the form of a slow Volt Switch that helps Xurkitree greatly, as it does not like switching in on most attacks.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Z-Hypnosis is what this set revolves around, being able to put the foe to sleep and raise the user's Speed by a stage in one turn. This gives Xurkitree an extra turn to set up Tail Glow, circumventing its mediocre bulk. This threatens passive teams greatly, as a single wrong switch can allow Xurkitree to sweep the entire team.</li> <li>Thunderbolt is its best STAB option and thus a given.</li> <li>Energy Ball is its best coverage move, being able to hit most switch-ins to Thunderbolt such as Ground-types and Lanturn.</li> <li>Energy Ball can, however, be switched out for Dazzling Gleam or Hidden Power Ice, which are equally viable. Dazzling Gleam helps a lot more against Dragon teams, while Hidden Power Ice can be used for pseudo-BoltBeam coverage.</li> <li>Tail Glow is the other essential setup move on this set. It raises Xurkitree's Special Attack by 3 stages, allowing it to become a much more devastating wallbreaker.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack and Speed maximize its sweeping potential.</li> <li>A Timid nature allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon with base 80 Speed such as Diggersby and Togekiss once Xurkitree has gotten its Speed boost through Z-Hypnosis.</li> <li>Psychium Z allows it to use Z-Hypnosis.</li> <li>Beast Boost raises its Special Attack whenever it gets a KO, making it even more dangerous as the battle goes on.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Z-Hypnosis can only be used once per game. Do not set up when a faster revenge killer is still healthy, as Xurkitree will not be able to get the Speed boost again if it switches out.</li> <li>Similarly, setting up while there are still Pokemon that can easily take a hit from boosted Xurkitree is unwise.</li> <li>This Xurkitree set can bluff a Choice Scarf in the early-game. Thus, it is wise to not give away Xurkitree's set early on, as it can sweep much more effectively if you can catch your opponent off guard.</li> <li>Even though Tapu Koko is an amazing partner for Xurkitree, make sure Xurkitree doesn't try to go for Hypnosis while Electric Terrain is up, as it will always fail to put the foe to sleep if grounded.</li> <li>It is unwise to go for Tail Glow unnecessarily. If Xurkitree doesn't need the boost in Special Attack, don't try to risk a one-turn sleep. Most of the time, the boost in Special Attack due to Beast Boost is enough.</li> <li>Try not to go for Z-Hypnosis versus potential users of Lum Berry, as Xurkitree can be KOed very easily if it gives a free turn to the foe.</li> <li>It is unwise to rely too much on Hypnosis's shaky accuracy. Only use it when Xurkitree cannot OHKO the opposing Pokemon or it needs to get the Speed boost to sweep the opponent's team.</li> <li>Due to its thin bulk, it cannot be switched in on strong attacks. As such, slow Volt Switch support is greatly appreciated to bring it in safely.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Even at +1 Speed, Xurkitree fails to outspeed most Choice Scarf users. Sticky Web support provided by Galvantula is very helpful, allowing it to outspeed most Choice Scarf users that it otherwise cannot.</li> <li>Alolan Raichu's wallbreaking potential helps out Xurkitree a ton, making it much easier to set up and sweep. Xurkitree can also wallbreak with Tail Glow, making it much easier for Surge Surfer Alolan Raichu to sweep late-game.</li> <li>Alolan Golem's Stealth Rock support is very important, limiting the foe from constantly switching. It also breaks Focus Sashes, which is very important, as Pokemon with Focus Sash can stop a sweep midway.</li> <li>Magnezone is able to support Xurkitree by removing or weakening most Steel-types that may annoy Xurkitree, making it easier for the latter to sweep. It can trap Choice Scarf Excadrill locked into Rock Slide and KO it, which is amazing for Xurkitree.</li> <li>Tapu Koko's ability to boost Xurkitree's Electric attacks is important. It makes Thunderbolt even more spammable. However, Xurkitree cannot put grounded Pokemon to sleep using Hypnosis in Electric Terrain, so it is a bit counter-intuitive.</li> <li>Rotom-W and Zapdos can switch in on Ground-type attacks, which can threaten Xurkitree greatly. They also provide slow Volt Switch support, which brings Xurkitree in safely to allow it to set up much more freely. Zapdos also has access to Defog, making it easier for Xurkitree to set up without taking too much damage from entry hazards.</li> </ul> "

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Celesteela is one of the best Pokemon Steel-type teams can use thanks to its good overall stats and Flying typing, giving it the ability to act as a wall or a bulky attacker. Its secondary Flying typing gives Steel teams a switch-in to Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Landorus and lets it pressure Ground-type teams immensely, as the recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers makes it hard to 2HKO for most Ground wallbreakers. Celesteela also provides a decent neutrality to Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Mega Gallade. With moves like Leech Seed, Toxic, and Protect, Celesteela can also wear down many offensive Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Landorus. Celesteela can also wear down opposing walls that Steel has trouble with, like Mantine and Porygon2, with its Leech Seed and Toxic combination. Moves like Flamethrower and Giga Drain allow Celesteela to make dealing with opposing Steel-types and Ground-types like Swampert, Ferrothorn, and Landorus. While Celesteela does not take advantage of Beast Boost as often as its other fellow Ultra Beasts do, if it lands a KO it can become much harder to take down because of its defensive boost. However, although Celesteela is a fantastic wall, setup sweepers like Mega Gallade can break past it, and stallbreakers like Mew can wall it. Celesteela also lacks a proper recovery move, making it heavily reliant on Leech Seed and Leftovers for recovery, which can be problematic against teams with Grass-type Pokemon. While Celesteela is a fantastic Pokemon on Steel teams, it still faces competition from Skarmory as a Ground-immune Pokemon, as Skarmory has superior physical bulk to take on Fighting-types that Steel teams would otherwise struggle with and can take on the Stealth Rock setting role, freeing up a moveslot for Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Celesteela is perfect on Flying teams as a physically defensive wall due to Gliscor being the best option as a special wall on Flying teams and Skarmory's lack of viability. Celesteela's incredible mixed bulk even without Special Defense investment lets it reliably check Pokemon like Choice Scarf Nihilego and gives it an edge over Skarmory. An impeccable Steel / Flying typing lets it take half the Stealth Rock damage that normal Flying-types do and leaves it weak to only two somewhat uncommon types that are easily checked by its teammates. Celesteela's typing also provides a plethora of resistances, notably to Fairy, Dragon, and Psychic attacks from Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Latios, and Mew. It also gives Celesteela an immunity to Toxic, giving it an excellent matchup against opposing walls such as Chansey. Other traits like a good Attack stat in conjunction with a generally powerful STAB attack means that types like Fairy and Rock will struggle to find a reliable switch-in. Celesteela's great offensive prowess in conjunction with access to Autotomize also gives it the option to run an offensive sweeper set that has the potential to break through common cores found on types like Steel and Water, especially when holding a Metronome. Celesteela's offensive Autotomize set capitalizes on its ability, Beast Boost, which makes it extremely difficult to wall after it gets a KO or two, especially against more offensive teams, and enables Celesteela to quickly snowball out of control against types such as Fairy. Defensive sets can make use of Beast Boost as well: Celesteela becomes extremely difficult for types like Rock to break through after boosting its Defense once or twice. Unfortunately, Celesteela has a crippling weakness to stallbreakers such as Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Mew as well as Taunt + Knock Off Gliscor. Celesteela's recovery in Leech Seed and Protect with Leftovers simply isn't reliable and leaves it vulnerable to Grass-types and forced to spam Leech Seed. Extremely powerful wallbreakers like Landorus and Mega Gallade are difficult for Celesteela to deal with. Landorus can use Gravity to exploit its typing, and Mega Gallade nearly OHKOes it after a single Swords Dance and is frequently run with Healing Wish support, thus receiving more opportunities to break past it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p>Celesteela can run a bulky Assault Vest set with moves like Giga Drain, Earthquake, and Hidden Power Ice that allows it to further help against Ground-type teams as well as check certain Pokemon like Gliscor and Nidoking with its massive movepool. Earthquake can be used on the Leech Seed set to hit grounded Magnet Pull users like Alolan Golem on the switch to prevent them from trapping Celesteela. It also hits opposing Steel- and Poison-types for decent chip damage. However, running Earthquake means that Celesteela has to give up Toxic and Flamethrower, which leaves it open to opposing walls like Mantine and Zapdos and lets opposing Steel-types likes Ferrothorn and Skarmory use it as free setup bait for Spikes or Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Earthquake on the physically defensive set is great for removing Heatran, as Flying teams struggle to switch into it reliably due to it commonly running Magma Storm, Toxic, and Taunt. However, that's one of the few specific cases that Earthquake is actually useful, and it is otherwise a waste of a moveslot. Flyinium Z on Autotomize Celesteela can be used to nuke threats, but this set will struggle more against defensive cores.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Trapping: Trappers like Heatran, Alolan Golem, and Magnezone can come in on Celesteela and proceed to trap and KO it with ease, but they must be wary of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Pokemon like Infernape, Blacephalon, Mega Manectric, and Alolan Raichu use their super effective STAB attacks to break through Celesteela's defenses with ease.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce prevents Celesteela from using Leech Seed or Toxic on it, which in turn makes chipping down Mega Sableye much harder. Along with Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp, Mega Sableye beats Celesteela in one-on-one situations and can switch into any of its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Celesteela gets beaten by stallbreakers like Keldeo and Mew, as they can stop its passive recovery and ignore its lackluster damage output.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p><strong>Stallbreakers: Mew and Gliscor break Celesteela down over time with Taunt and Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off, respectively. Heatran's super effective trapping move along with Taunt is difficult for Celesteela to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Celesteela struggles with extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Life Orb Kyurem-B and Choice Specs Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Strong Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y are only threatened by Celesteela's Toxic and can easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko and other Electric-types like Substitute + Toxic Zapdos are extremely threatening to Celesteela, with the former outright OHKOing it and the latter able to set up Substitute on it and beat it one-on-one with its super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Walls: Walls such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, Mega Sableye, and Heatran wall Celesteela or can use it to set up entry hazards.</p> </section>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Leech Seed Tank (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed is Celesteela's best form of recovery, allowing it to chip away at attackers that it walls. Protect paired with Leech Seed allows Celesteela to wear down opposing attackers and keeps it healthy at the same time. This can also be used to scout opposing offensive Pokemon like Choice Band Diggersby and Choice Specs Keldeo, two big threats to Steel teams. Heavy Slam is Celesteela's main STAB move and is used to further chip down opposing Pokemon, most notably 2HKOing Landorus after Stealth Rock damage and preventing it from setting up Gravity in front of Celesteela. Toxic is used to beat opposing walls like Mantine and Porygon2 while pressuring them with Leech Seed as well as being able to wear down opposing Pokemon that try to switch into Heavy Slam, like Keldeo. Flamethrower is used to hit opposing Steel-types like Ferrothorn and opposing Celesteela so your Celesteela can effectively get rid of other threats to the team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum health investment paired with 160 Defense EVs alongside a Relaxed nature helps Celesteela avoid 2HKOs from Mega Lopunny, Jolly Mega Sharpedo, and Terrakion. Celesteela should opt to use an Impish nature if it is using Toxic over Flamethrower so its Speed isn't compromised against other slow walls like Clefable. 96 Special Defense EVs help Celesteela switch into Landorus safely and avoid getting 2HKOed by Zapdos. Leftovers is used to maximize Celesteela's passive recovery. Beast Boost allows Celesteela to increase its Defense after successfully KOing the opposing Pokemon, which allows it to wall more than it could before, such as being able to take +2 Mega Gallade's Close Combat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Celesteela into Choice Scarf users like Terrakion or Gengar that lack super effective coverage, as Celesteela can easily take the attacks they have and start wearing them down or even force a switch. This does not mean that you can just throw Celesteela into any attacker, however, so be wary of any offensive Pokemon like Nidoking or Calm Mind Keldeo that can potentially 2HKO Celesteela. Using Protect to scout for moves like Choice Band Diggersby's Fire Punch is immensely useful for the entire team and allows you to avoid having to make predictions. Try to refrain from using Protect on the last turn that the foe is alive, as it means you won't be able to reliably use it again to scout the next Pokemon that comes in. Predicting switches with Leech Seed and Toxic can wear down opposing Pokemon further and can prevent Celesteela from needing to switch out, as it reduces the risk of getting 2HKOed by the opposing Pokemon. Try to use Toxic preemptively if you think a wall is about to come in, as it will allow you to easily wear it down as the game goes on. Use Leech Seed preemptively if you think an offensive Pokemon or status-afflicted Pokemon will come in so you can wear it down more. Avoid Knock Off, as it removes Celesteela's consistent recovery, which limits its ability to effectively wall opposing Pokemon. If the opponent has a Magnet Pull user like Alolan Golem or Magnezone, try to be more careful by double switching to lure out these Pokemon so Celesteela does not get trapped. Also try to avoid getting any sort of status ailment on Celesteela, especially burn, as it negates its Leftovers and makes it harder for it to wall effectively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Celesteela helps its teammates immensely by wearing down opposing walls for its offensive partners and walling certain physical attackers for its other defensive partners. Heatran is essential to all Steel teams and benefits Celesteela by switching into Fire-type attacks thanks to its Flash Fire ability. It can also trap and eliminate enemy walls like Mega Venusaur with Magma Storm and use Taunt to prevent them from recovering. Choice Scarf Excadrill can take down threats to Celesteela like Choice Band Infernape and Choice Specs Blacephalon while also serving as a switch-in to Electric-type attacks. Ferrothorn and Skarmory are great assisting walls for Celesteela that can take hits and provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support. Ferrothorn in particular takes down bulky Water-types like Swampert and Gastrodon that Celesteela struggles against while also serving as a nice Electric switch-in for it. Skarmory eases the pressure on Celesteela to check physical Fighting-types like Mega Gallade thanks to its reliable recovery in Roost. Mega Scizor, Bisharp, and Jirachi all appreciate Celesteela's ability to wear down walls like Porygon2, Mandibuzz, and Chansey so that they can sweep opposing teams more easily. Magnezone can trap annoying Steel-types like Ferrothorn and opposing Celesteela with Magnet Pull, which allows Celesteela to get walled less and wear down more of the opposing team.</p> "

        "name": "Physically Defensive (Flying)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed gives Celesteela a form of recovery and helps break down checks like Tapu Koko on the switch. Protect is great for wearing down the opponent with Toxic and gaining more health with Leech Seed and Leftovers. Protect also lets Celesteela scout for opposing Choice-locked Pokemon. Heavy Slam, supported by a decent uninvested Attack and Celesteela's weight, is its strongest and most consistent STAB move that's great for removing Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales and Mega Diancie. Toxic lets Celesteela threaten defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Porygon2 that would otherwise beat it. Flamethrower lets Celesteela threaten opposing Steel-types like Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers gives Celesteela another way to help mitigate its lack of a solid recovery move. Beast Boost lets Celesteela gain a boost to its Defense every time it KOes an opposing Pokemon. 252 HP EVs, 252 Defense EVs, and an Impish nature maximize Celesteela's potential to take on physical attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keeping Celesteela healthy attributes to its success as a wall, so do everything you can to accomplish this. Use Leech Seed liberally and avoid status and Knock Off to prevent it from being worn down. Use Toxic to cripple walls like Mantine that Celesteela struggles with. Understand that KOing a foe with Leech Seed or Toxic will not activate Beast Boost, so if Celesteela needs the Defense boost to finish out a game, attack the opposing Pokemon with Heavy Slam instead of stalling it out with Protect and Leech Seed. Hitting predicted switch-ins with Toxic or Leech Seed can be important to wear them down for teammates like Mega Aerodactyl. If running Flamethrower, reveal it in key matchups such as against opposing Steel-types, where it's very important to take out threats like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos can take on Electric-types for Celesteela and, if Celesteela lacks Flamethrower, remove Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor for it. Mantine is a fantastic switch-in for Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y that Celesteela struggles against. Mega Aerodactyl is a great way of keeping faster foes in check that can also check wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Tapu Koko as well as remove a massive nuisance in Choice item Victini with Pursuit. Gliscor is fantastic at blocking burn and paralysis for Celesteela; it can switch into Pokemon like Will-O-Wisp Mew and absorb weak Scalds from Pokemon like Toxapex and defensive Swampert. It also checks Electric-types like Tapu Koko for Celesteela and provides Defog support. Tornadus-T's access to Knock Off and Taunt allows it to break down opposing walls like Toxapex that Celesteela struggles with. It can also outpace and remove wallbreakers like Kyurem-B. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can remove troublesome Electric-types like Tapu Koko and wallbreakers like Choice Band Victini.</p> "

        "name": "Autotomize Sweeper (Flying)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Autotomize lets Celesteela boost its middling Speed tier to much higher levels, letting it outpace Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Air Slash is Celesteela's main STAB move and has a 30% chance of causing the foe to flinch, which gives it a chance to break past walls such as Toxapex. Flash Cannon is Celesteela's secondary STAB move that does well against more prevalent types such as Fairy. Celesteela's inability to hit Steel-types is mitigated by running Flamethrower in the last moveslot, but Celesteela will still struggle against Heatran because of Flash Fire. Giga Drain can be used to specifically help against types like Ground.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment lets Celesteela be as strong and fast as possible. A Timid nature lets Celesteela outpace non-Choice Scarf Magnezone before boosting and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and Adamant Mega Swampert under rain after boosting. Celesteela can quickly spiral out of control against defensive and offensive teams alike with Beast Boost, which gives it a Special Attack boost every time it gets a KO. Metronome allows Celesteela to threaten defensive cores such as Mega Swampert + Toxapex + Mantine prior to gaining Special Attack boosts.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Capitalize on Celesteela's great bulk and typing by setting up on Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Choice Band Scizor. Prioritize setting up late-game when walls are weakened so Celesteela can more easily active Beast Boost to get a sweep going. Similarly, preserve Celesteela's health so it won't have to worry about being KOed when it finds an opportunity to set up. Break through defensive cores by spamming a STAB attack, fully taking advantage of Metronome. Avoid paralysis from Pokemon like Klefki, as the Speed drop will cut into Celesteela's sweeping potential.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Lead Aerodactyl is a fantastic lead for hyper offense teams and can nearly always guarantee Stealth Rock for Celesteela thanks to Taunt. Wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus-T, and Choice Band Dragonite are great for breaking down defensive cores for a Celesteela sweep. Dragonite can also pick off weakened foes with priority Extreme Speed. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a great way to remove Electric-types like Tapu Koko, can potentially provide Stealth Rock, and can bring Celesteela in easily with U-turn. Swords Dance Hawlucha can be used to break down defensive cores for Celesteela.</p> "

  "Stakataka": {
    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Stakataka's high Attack, abysmal Speed, and access to Trick Room make it a great Trick Room sweeper for Steel teams. Its secondary Rock typing offers useful coverage in important matchups such as Flying and Fire and grants it a neutrality to Fire that helps it set up on Fire-types such as Victini locked into V-create. Stakataka boasts the strongest Gyro Ball in the metagame, limiting the number of Pokemon that can switch into it. Under a Trick Room, Stakataka outspeeds nearly every single Pokemon in the game, making it an instant offensive threat once it sets up. Because of this, Stakataka also shines against more offensively oriented types such as Dragon and Psychic, which do not have many Pokemon that can constantly switch into it. This is complemented by its Beast Boost ability, which allows it to quickly snowball against many teams after gaining an Attack boost by KOing a Pokemon. Stakataka makes excellent use of STAB Stone Edge in tandem with Rockium Z, as it can allow it to blow past defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Skarmory after a boost. On top of its great offensive prowess, Stakataka has a very respectable 61 / 211 / 101 bulk, giving it plenty of opportunities throughout the game to set up with Trick Room. Its bulk is less great than it initially seems, however, as Stakataka is required to run 15 Defense IVs and a Lonely nature in order for Beast Boost to increase its Attack instead of its Defense. While Stakataka has a decent offensive typing, it suffers defensively, with two quadruple weaknesses to very common offensive typings in Fighting and Ground, which Steel teams do not appreciate stacking a weakness to. Outside of Trick Room, it is very easy to check, as many Pokemon can outspeed it and take advantage of its common weaknesses and average special bulk. Despite being a dangerous threat to offensive teams, Stakataka finds itself checked by common defensive walls such as Ferrothorn and Swampert. Stakataka also often finds itself overly reliant on Continental Crush in order to obtain an Attack boost, as it has little wallbreaking power before a boost. Additionally, Stakataka is very predictable and can usually be played around, as the foe will likely know when it will set up with Trick Room. Stakataka's dependence on Trick Room can also make it detrimental to faster teammates such as Excadrill, making Stakataka hard to fit on certain teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p>Life Orb can be run instead of Rockium Z on teams that already have a Z-Move user such as Bisharp.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Steel</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Just about any Ground-type such as Excadrill, Landorus, or Garchomp can outspeed Stakataka outside of Trick Room and KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Similarly, Fighting-type Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Heracross find it easy to take advantage of Stakataka's quadruple weakness and KO it with their STAB moves.

        "name": "Trick Room Sweeper (Steel)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room enables Stakataka to outpace nearly every Pokemon for five turns, making it an instant threat to offensive teams. Gyro Ball is Stakataka's main STAB move, as its consistently high Base Power thanks to Stakataka's very low Speed makes it very spammable against most teams. Stone Edge acts as a secondary STAB move and allows Stakataka to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y. It can also be used as a powerful Continental Crush, which can damage many Pokemon that can otherwise switch in, such as defensive Landorus-T. Earthquake is the preferred coverage move, as it can hit Pokemon that otherwise wall Stakataka, namely Toxapex, Magnezone, and opposing Stakataka.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment is necessary in order for Stakataka to hit as hard as possible. Maximum HP gives Stakataka more bulk and opportunities to set up Trick Room. 15 IVs in Defense alongside a Lonely nature are required in order for Beast Boost to raise Stakataka's Attack stat every time it obtains a KO. 0 IVs in Speed make Stakataka as slow as possible in order to maximize the damage output from Gyro Ball and the number of Pokemon it can outpace under Trick Room. Rockium Z allows Stakataka fire off its powerful Z-Move, maximizing its offensive capabilities and limiting defensive switch-ins. Beast Boost allows it to be an even deadlier sweeper, further limiting defensive checks after just one boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Stakataka's bulk and typing to set up with Trick Room against threats such as Zapdos, Latios, and Choice-locked Victini. With this in mind, however, do not recklessly allow Stakataka to take unnecessary damage, as it has no way to recover HP. Stakataka often forces switches thanks to its immediate offensive power, so it appreciates entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes being up before setting Trick Room in order to wear down switch-ins. Stakataka can easily be lured and taken out by by Ground- and Fighting-type coverage from the likes of Earthquake Celesteela and Focus Blast Victini, so it is important to keep this in mind and scout for these moves before attempting to set up on these Pokemon. Additionally, burns from the likes of Scald and Will-O-Wisp can severely limit Stakataka, as the halved Attack stat will make it much easier to counter defensively. Use Stakataka's Z-Move in situations where a regular attack lacks the power to dent the foe, such as against Celesteela and Mega Scizor after an Attack boost. Additionally, while Stakataka can easily set up Trick Room against most physical walls, it struggles to break past many of them without prior chip damage. Generally speaking, Gyro Ball's consistently high power and 100% accuracy mean that it's easily spammable in most scenarios. Lastly, preserve Stakataka in matchups such as Flying and Dragon, as Stakataka's STAB combination in tandem with the lack of defensive answers on these types makes it a great sweeper in these matchups.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Stakataka functions as a late-game sweeper, it appreciates bulky teammates that can stack entry hazards in order for Stakataka to sweep more effectively and wear down its switch-ins. Ferrothorn boasts a resistance to Water, a neutrality to Ground, and the ability to set up hazards for Stakataka to wear down opposing Pokemon. Ferrothorn's very low Speed also goes in hand with Stakataka's use of Trick Room. Celesteela is a great teammate that provides a defensive check to many Pokemon that threaten Stakataka such as Greninja and Ground-types such as Garchomp. Skarmory functions as a check to various Ground- and Fighting-types that Stakataka cannot take on, such as Landorus-T and Heracross. Unlike Celesteela, Skarmory can compress the roles of a hazard setter and a hazard remover, making it a suitable teammate. Mega Scizor's bulk and ability to help keep faster foes in check even under Trick Room thanks to its access to strong priority also make it a great teammate for Stakataka. Its U-turn support also allows Stakataka to be brought in safely, giving it more setup opportunities. While Heatran shares common weaknesses with Stakataka, it's a premier special attacker that can easily deal with defensive Pokemon as well as offensive threats such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y thanks to its useful Fire immunity. Klefki's dual screens support benefits Stakataka by providing it with even more opportunities to safely set up with Trick Room. Jirachi is a decent offensive teammate that can break past problematic Pokemon such as Toxapex thanks to its useful Psychic typing. Lastly, Bronzong is an alternative Trick Room user that shares a low Speed stat and a typing that complements Stakataka and the rest of the team thanks to its Ground immunity and neutrality to Fighting, giving it setup opportunities against types that Stakataka may have more trouble with, such as the aforementioned Fighting and Ground.</p> "

  "Blacephalon": {
    "overview": "<h1>Fire</h1> <p>Blacephalon has great Special Attack and Speed, rivaling the stats of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, making Blacephalon a nice offensive teammate on any Fire team. Blacephalon can make good use of either Choice Scarf to be a great revenge killer and cleaner or Choice Specs to become a strong wallbreaker. With Beast Boost raising Blacephalon's Special Attack every time it gets a KO and its ability to KO at least one Pokemon in about every matchup, Blacephalon can even sweep the opposing team in the right circumstances, especially if the opponent mispredicts its set. Unlike some other Fire-types, Blacephalon has room to carry Hidden Power Ice to ease the otherwise extremely hard Dragon matchup as well as other matchups like Flying and Ground, KOing the likes of Dragonite with prior damage and Landorus for its teammates. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Blacephalon can revenge kill Choice Scarf Nihilego, one of the greatest threats to Fire teams, with Psyshock after opposing Pursuit trappers on the Poison or Rock team are gone. On the other hand, if Trick is used on either set, Blacephalon can cripple some would-be checks like Chansey and Mantine by locking them into a single move. Additionally, Blacephalon's typing makes it immune or at least resistant to most priority moves, such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Mamoswine's Ice Shard. However, Blacephalon's bulk is so ridiculously low that even resisted hits like Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch and Stakataka's Gyro Ball can 2HKO or even OHKO it. Couple that with a commonly found Stealth Rock weakness among Fire teams, and this means Blacephalon is extremely easy to wear down and cannot freely switch in and out of the field without proper hazard clearing and U-turn or Volt Switch support from its teammates. Furthermore, Blacephalon's poor offensive coverage options, limited to Hidden Power and a non-STAB Psychic-type move, often lead it to become deadweight in some matchups, such as against Dark and Rock teams. Finally, Blacephalon's Speed tier is a single point shy of Terrakion's and Keldeo's, while being three points below Latios's, all problematic threats to handle for Fire teams, making Blacephalon sometimes hard to make good use of against teams that often carry those Pokemon.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Blacephalon is a good offensive option on Ghost-type teams because of its high Special Attack, which allows it to serve as an effective wallbreaker, and Speed, which helps it revenge kill Pokemon with base 100 Speed such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona. Blacephalon notably is able to take on Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-type threats such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Alolan Ninetales because of its Fire-type coverage. Its Special Attack is further increased after every KO by its ability, Beast Boost, allowing it to snowball if its checks and counters have been worn down enough. Blacephalon also pairs well with many offensive Pokemon on Ghost, such as Gengar and Mimikyu, because of its high offensive stats and typing. Although it has high Special Attack, Blacephalon lacks coverage, thus getting walled by Pokemon such as Tyranitar, though it can use Trick to cripple some of its usual switch-ins such as Chansey and Mantine. Blacephalon also is easily worn down by Stealth Rock because of its Fire typing, and due to its lackluster defensive typing and bulk, Blacephalon can rarely switch in for free and is easily knocked out by a strong attack. In addition, Blacephalon is prone to getting revenge killed by faster threats such as Latios and Keldeo when not holding a Choice Scarf. Blacephalon is also easily trapped and eliminated by Pursuit because of its Ghost typing.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p>A Substitute + Calm Mind set with both STAB moves and a Z-Crystal can ease prediction against slower, bulkier teams while being somewhat effective against offensive teams if Substitute is used on a predicted switch. However, Blacephalon tends to have a hard time to set up in any way due to its frailty. Giving Blacephalon a Life Orb enables it to increase its damage output without being locked into a single move and run other moves like Taunt, which actually allows it to completely shut down Chansey. On the other hand, Blacephalon would much rather be Fire teams' way of keeping faster foes in check or wallbreak without getting worn out by repeated rounds of Life Orb recoil and missing out on 2HKOing Mantine after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>A Substitute + Calm Mind set can be run with a Z-Move, although Blacephalon rarely finds a setup opportunity and the Z-Crystal could easily be used on something else, such as Mimikyu. Psychic can be run over Hidden Power Ice or Trick on a Choice Scarf set in order to hit Pokemon such as Toxapex and Keldeo for super effective damage, although it is very situational and Alolan Muk still switches into Blacephalon and traps it with Pursuit. A Life Orb set is an option, allowing Blacephalon to switch between its attacks in order to hit various targets while also boosting its power. Holding a Life Orb also allows Blacephalon to utilize moves such as Taunt and Explosion, with the former allowing it to break down defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and the latter allowing it to knock out Alolan Muk after Stealth Rock. Mind Blown can be used on the Choice Specs set to nuke certain Pokemon, such as Alolan Muk, harder. However, Mind Blown generally isn't a good idea, as it can be situational and the recoil massively wears Blacephalon down and puts it in range of common priority moves.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Tyranitar: All Blacephalon sets are completely hard walled by Tyranitar due to its typing and natural bulk. Tyranitar also easily OHKOes it with Pursuit or Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit trappers</strong>: Alolan Muk, Mega Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar can all tank one or two hits from Blacephalon before using Pursuit to KO it with ease. Additionally, Alolan Muk takes little damage from Choice Scarf variants, and Mega Aerodactyl naturally outspeeds Choice Specs variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Water-types: Choice Scarf Greninja and Keldeo (or non-Choice Scarf variants if against Choice Specs Blacephalon), in addition of Kingdra in the rain, can all easily outspeed Blacephalon and KO it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Choice Scarf Blacephalon can't properly KO Rock-types like Mega Diancie or non-Choice Scarf Terrakion (even less so in the sand) if they've not been weakened beforehand, and Choice Specs variants are outsped by them. It goes without saying that those Rock-types will OHKO any Blacephalon variant without much trouble.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Like the previously mentioned Greninja and Keldeo, faster Choice Scarf users like Terrakion and Latios all outspeed and OHKO Blacephalon, even when it's at full health.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Chansey and Mantine are one of the best switch-ins to Blacephalon, as they easily sponge its STAB and coverage moves. However, these Pokemon have to be cautious of Blacephalon's Trick, which will cripple them for the remainder of the match.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Even though Blacephalon resists or is immune to most forms of priority, some Pokemon like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Bisharp can KO or at least heavily threaten Blacephalon with their own respective priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Status: Blacephalon dislikes every kind of status, as being badly poisoned will drastically shorten its sweep and being paralyzed will cripple Blacephalon beyond repair, since it'll be so much slower and prone to be easily revenge killed.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar hard-counters Blacephalon because it has the typing and bulk to switch into its STAB attacks and trap it with Pursuit. Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar can also use Blacephalon as setup fodder, which can prove to be fatal to the rest of the team.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon, such as Greninja and Keldeo, threaten Blacephalon with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Like many other Ghost-type Pokemon, Blacephalon is threatened by Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo, as they are able to knock it out with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-type Pokemon, such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie, are able to KO Blacephalon with their Rock-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit users, such as Alolan Muk and Tyranitar, have both the bulk and typing to switch into any of Blacephalon's attacks and trap it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf users Latios, Terrakion, and Gengar outspeed Blacephalon and knock it out with their respective attacks, although they can't directly switch in in fear of getting knocked out themselves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Special walls, such as Mantine and Chansey, have no problem taking any of Blacephalon's attacks, although they do need to be wary of Trick.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Bisharp and Azumarill revenge kill Blacephalon by outspeeding it and exploiting its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards and status both wear Blacephalon down over time, making it easier for opposing Pokemon to knock it out. Wearing Blacephalon down also makes it much more vulnerable to priority, as its terrible bulk rarely lets it take a hit.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is Blacephalon's most spammable STAB attack and is great in many matchups, such as against Psychic teams. Fire Blast is Blacephalon's chosen Fire-type STAB move, enabling it to deal considerable damage in the sun, even against resisted targets, always 2HKOing Hydreigon for instance. Flamethrower is an alternative if Fire Blast's accuracy is an issue, but its lowered damage output makes Blacephalon miss out on OHKOing threats like Tapu Koko and 2HKOing others like specially defensive Cradily in the sun. Hidden Power Ice lets Blacephalon KO troublesome Dragon- and Ground-types like Dragonite after its Multiscale is broken, Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Psyshock allows Blacephalon to revenge kill Choice Scarf Nihilego, one of the greatest threats for Fire teams, and take on Poison teams once Alolan Muk is eliminated. If crippling walls is desirable to your team, Trick can be used instead to shut down foes like Chansey and Mantine that Blacephalon cannot otherwise touch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf lets Blacephalon be as fast as possible, outspeeding opposing Choice Scarf users like Nihilego and Victini. It also needs maximum investment in Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. With those EV investments, Blacephalon's ability Beast Boost will boost its Special Attack by one stage every time it KOes an opposing Pokemon, enabling it to clean weakened teams late-game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Send Blacephalon on the field after its checks, such as Chansey and Toxapex, are weakened or gone, so that it can effectively sweep the enemy team. However, because Blacephalon is extremely frail, directly sending it onto the field is not recommended. Instead, use a teammate's slow U-turn or Volt Switch or switch in Blacephalon after a teammate has been KOed to preserve its health. For Blacephalon to efficiently sweep teams, it will more often than not need Stealth Rock support from a teammate before it's able to revenge kill fast or bulky offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Dragonite. Therefore, setting up the entry hazard before sending Blacephalon onto the field can be crucial. Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk threaten to KO Blacephalon and take minimal damage from its coverage moves. Therefore, it would be best to either avoid bringing Blacephalon onto the field while they're healthy or to immediately switch Blacephalon out as a lure into an offensive teammate that can handle them. Furthermore, if an opposing Pursuit trapper is alive, revenge killing dangerous threats like Choice Scarf Nihilego can be problematic, as they simply switch on Blacephalon and easily KO it. So, if possible, try and dispose of such threats with one of Blacephalon's teammates that wouldn't be bothered as much by Pursuit trappers. If Trick is run over Psyshock, it can be used to great effect by luring and crippling problematic walls like Chansey, Mantine, and Toxapex that Blacephalon cannot seriously harm otherwise so that they become deadweight for the rest of the match. Finally, try and avoid any kind of status, especially paralysis. A paralyzed Blacephalon cannot efficiently perform its role as a revenge killer due to its greatly reduced Speed stat and becomes a lot easier to revenge kill, being outsped and OHKOed by Mamoswine's Earthquake for example.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Infernape is an amazing partner for this Blacephalon variant: it can punch holes in the enemy team so that it's easier for Blacephalon to sweep, safely bring it on the field with U-turn, and beat troublesome Dark, Rock and Normal teams with Close Combat and Iron Fist-boosted Mach Punch. In return, Blacephalon can sweep Psychic and Ghost teams, which Infernape has trouble with, with little support. Mega Charizard X forms a potent sweeping duo with Blacephalon that can beat each other's checks and tear opposing teams apart. For example, against Poison teams, Mega Charizard X takes care of Alolan Muk for Blacephalon, which paves the way for Blacephalon to sweep the rest of the Poison team with Psyshock. The support Torkoal brings to Blacephalon and Fire teams in general as a sun and entry hazard setter, spinner, and physical wall is really important, since it can enable Blacephalon to OHKO Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage and Mega Lopunny in the sun while clearing entry hazards away and easily sponging most priority moves aimed at Blacephalon. Rotom-H is a nice teammate for Blacephalon due to its access to a slow Volt Switch, both Light Screen and Reflect, and Defog, which lets Blacephalon safely come onto the field, clean opposing teams more easily, and not worry about entry hazard damage or opposing screens cutting its sweep short. Rotom-H also brings a welcomed immunity to Ground-type moves for Fire teams. In return, Blacephalon can KO many Ground-types like Landorus and Garchomp, which Rotom-H ironically cannot touch, with Hidden Power Ice. Mega Charizard Y is an appreciated secondary weather setter and wallbreaker that pressures opposing Water-types, easing Blacephalon's job of cleaning the enemy team late-game. Victini is another wallbreaker that pressures Water-types, especially Mantine, so that Blacephalon has more opportunities to clean the opposing team. Furthermore, it can even safely bring Blacephalon onto the field with U-turn. Heatran can trap and remove bulky threats like Toxapex, letting Blacephalon have an easier time sweeping the enemy team, and can KO Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon. Volcanion can act as a check to troublesome Water-types with Water Absorb, such as Azumarill, and a secondary hazard clearer with Defog for Blacephalon.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball helps Blacephalon deal with bulky Water-types and other opposing threats that resist its Fire-type STAB move. In particular, Shadow Ball OHKOes Pelipper and (Mega) Slowbro, in addition to 2HKOing Toxapex and Assault Vest Seismitoad. Fire Blast is Blacephalon's preferred Fire-type STAB move, as it delivers devastating blows to opposing threats, such as OHKOing Hippowdon and 2HKOing Porygon2. Flamethrower can replace Fire Blast if the better accuracy is more than important than the superior firepower, but Flamethrower can still be strong enough if used in the sun. Hidden Power Ice is Blacephalon's way to dispose of dangerous Dragon- and Ground-types, such as Dragonite (outside of Multiscale) and Garchomp. Trick is Blacephalon's last move, crippling walls that would usually switch in and comfortably sponge its attacking moves, such as Chansey and Mantine, by replacing their item with a Choice Specs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack with Choice Specs lets Blacephalon be as powerful as possible, OHKOing or 2HKOing most opposing Pokemon, such as Armaldo after Stealth Rock damage (or in the sun) and Araquanid, respectively. Blacephalon also needs maximum Speed investment to become as fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed common Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus. With this EV investment, Beast Boost, Blacephalon's only ability, will boost its Special Attack by one stage every time it KOes an opposing Pokemon, enabling it to clean slower teams late-game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Since this Blacephalon variant is more of a wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, it should be switched into passive threats like Mega Venusaur and Clefable so that it can deal a great amount of damage to them or one of their teammates if they switch out. As a wallbreaker, Blacephalon should be used early-game to punch holes into the enemy team to weaken walls and, if possible, KO other opposing Pokemon so that sweepers like Mega Charizard X and revenge killers like Choice Scarf Infernape have an easier time cleaning the opposing team. Because Blacephalon is extremely frail, directly sending it onto the field is not always recommended. A safer way to put Blacephalon on the field would be using a teammate's slow U-turn or Volt Switch or switching it in after a teammate has been KOed to preserve its health. Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk threaten to KO Blacephalon and take minimal damage from its coverage moves. To avoid being trapped and prematurely losing Blacephalon, it would be best to either keep Blacephalon off the field while they're healthy or immediately switch Blacephalon out as a lure to an offensive teammate that can handle them. Trick should be used against problematic special walls, such as Chansey and Mantine, that try to switch into Blacephalon's attacking moves. Try to avoid any kind of status, especially paralysis, as it severely cripples Blacephalon, making it slower than the vast majority of Pokemon and prone to being revenge killed, even by the likes of Skarmory. Finally, even when considering Blacephalon's might, it sometimes needs Stealth Rock support from a teammate before it's able to KO Focus Sash users like Breloom or certain walls without the need of sun support like Zapdos. Therefore, setting up the entry hazard before sending Blacephalon onto the field is often recommended.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Infernape is a great partner for this Blacephalon variant: it can outspeed and revenge kill various Pokemon like +1 Mega Sharpedo and Choice Scarf Nihilego, in addition of safely bringing Blacephalon onto the field with U-turn. In return, Blacephalon can wallbreak against the opposing team to ease Infernape's job of revenge killing. Torkoal's Drought can reduce the damage output from opposing Water-type attacks and increase Blacephalon's Fire-type STAB move's firepower to absurd levels, enabling it to OHKO specially defensive Mega Sableye and even 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock damage if Fire Blast is used. Being a staple on Fire teams, Torkoal can also set up Stealth Rock to punish opposing switches, clear away entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and, due to its great physical bulk, switch into priority moves aimed at Blacephalon. Rotom-H is a nice teammate for Blacephalon due to its access to a slow Volt Switch, both Light Screen and Reflect, and Defog, which lets Blacephalon safely come onto the field, punch holes into opposing teams more easily, and not worry about entry hazard damage or opposing screens preventing Blacephalon from properly performing its wallbreaking job. Rotom-H also brings a welcomed immunity to Ground-type moves for Fire teams. In return, Blacephalon can KO many Ground-types like Hippowdon and Assault Vest Seismitoad, which Rotom-H cannot touch. Mega Charizard X is the premier sweeper for Fire teams and can clean opposing teams after Blacephalon has weakened them with its powerful attacks. For example, against Ground teams, once Blacephalon has taken care of Hippowdon and the sand has dissipated, Charizard is free to set up a Dragon Dance before Mega Evolving and sweep the rest of the team. Volcarona is another sweeper that can take advantage of Blacephalon's wallbreaking abilities by cleaning weakened teams. In return, Blacephalon can 2HKO some threats that Volcarona has trouble with, such as Toxapex and Mantine after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, Volcarona and Blacephalon can tear Psychic teams apart when used together. Heatran, when used alongside this Blacephalon set, can greatly pressure slower teams, as the former can trap, slowly wear down and prevent walls from recovering their HP with Magma Storm and Taunt, while the latter can finish those walls afterwards. Heatran can also deal with Mega Diancie for Blacephalon and its other teammates. Victini can form a potent wallbreaking duo with Blacephalon and pressure Water-types, in addition to slower teams in general. Furthermore, Victini can even safely bring Blacephalon onto the field with U-turn. With Water Absorb, Volcanion can switch into Water-type moves like Keldeo's or Mantine's Scald aimed at Blacephalon while also checking the dangerous threat that is Belly Drum Azumarill with Sludge Wave and clearing entry hazards away with Defog for Fire teams.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fire Blast allows Blacephalon to hit Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-type Pokemon for super effective damage, although it can miss at crucial moments. Alternatively, Flamethrower can be used if missing tends to be a problem, although Flamethrower hits less hard than Fire Blast, meaning it misses out on knocking out Pokemon such as Landorus from full health. Shadow Ball allows Blacephalon to 2HKO Pokemon such as Toxapex while also hitting many Pokemon neutrally, and Hidden Power Ice gives Blacephalon the ability to hit Dragon-, Flying-, and Ground-types, such as Dragonite and Garchomp, for super effective damage. Trick cripples walls that may switch in to Blacephalon, which is particularly useful for Pokemon such as Chansey and Mantine.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Speed along with a Timid nature makes Blacephalon as fast as possible, while maximum investment in Special Attack allows Blacephalon to hit as hard as possible. Choice Specs further increases Blacephalon's Special Attack, allowing it to be an effective wallbreaker that can OHKO threats such as Landorus and Diggersby. Beast Boost is Blacephalon's only ability and increases its Special Attack every time it manages to collect a KO, making it easy for Blacephalon to snowball when its checks and counters have been weakened and eliminated.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to remove entry hazards on your side before sending in Blacephalon to avoid any potential chip damage. Stealth Rock noticeably wears Blacephalon down over time, allowing Pokemon with priority moves such as Scizor, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Lopunny to knock it out. Double out of predicted Pursuit trapper switch-ins, such as Alolan Muk, so that Blacephalon doesn't get trapped. As it is primarily a wallbreaker, send Blacephalon in on defensive threats like Mega Venusaur and Celesteela that the rest of your team could have trouble dealing with. Blacephalon can also be a sweeper late-game when its checks and counters have been severely weakened or eliminated. Use Trick on special walls such as Mantine and Chansey that would otherwise wall Blacephalon, although it should be wary of using Trick because losing Choice Specs makes Blacephalon significantly weaker. Keep Blacephalon from getting inflicted with paralysis, as getting paralyzed makes Blacephalon slow and vulnerable to faster attackers. Try getting Stealth Rock on the field before sending in Blacephalon, as Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sashes and weakens Blacephalon's checks and counters, making a potential sweep much easier to achieve, and helps Blacephalon take out Pokemon such as Toxapex, Assault Vest Celesteela, and Dragonite. Bluffing a Choice Scarf is perfectly doable in order to force out Pokemon such as Victini, Tapu Koko, Latios, and Mega Lopunny.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs Blacephalon is generally a good option on Ghost teams due to the range of Pokemon it can take on as a wallbreaker. As a result of this, Gengar is a very good partner for Blacephalon, as they pair together very well offensively. Choice Scarf Gengar can beat threats such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Mantine for Blacephalon due to its Speed and coverage. Decidueye and Dhelmise make good teammates for Blacephalon due to their ability to remove Stealth Rock and any other potential entry hazards that may limit Blacephalon switching in. Decidueye and Dhelmise are also able to switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks for Blacephalon, and Blacephalon can beat Steel-type Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor for them in return. Decidueye and Dhelmise trap Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tapu Koko, which Blacephalon may have a hard time against, with their respective trapping moves. Like many other offensive Ghost-type Pokemon, Blacephalon appreciates Mega Sableye as a partner because of its ability to reflect entry hazards, switch into attacks, and act as a defensive backbone to pivot into. Mega Sableye is also able to switch into various Dark- and Ghost-type moves for Blacephalon when needed, while Blacephalon is able to beat many Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu for Mega Sableye. Because of their ability to set Stealth Rock, Alolan Marowak and Golurk are good partners for Blacephalon to weaken the opposing team by destroying Focus Sashes and chipping Pokemon, therefore paving the way for Blacephalon to sweep. Alolan Marowak can also switch into Tapu Koko for Blacephalon. Jellicent is a good option, as it can absorb Water-type attacks and break many defensive threats such as Toxapex and Chansey with Taunt. Mimikyu is an excellent partner for Blacephalon, as it beats Dark-type Pokemon that Blacephalon struggle with such as Mega Sharpedo, Hydreigon, Alolan Muk, and Tyranitar, while Blacephalon can knock out Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn that Mimikyu might have trouble getting past.</p> "

Beast Boost is Blacephalon's only ability and can be used in conjunction with a Choice Scarf to sweep late-game by raising its Special Attack every time it manages to knock a Pokemon out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Send Blacephalon in late-game when its checks and counters such as Mantine and Alolan Muk have been weakened or eliminated so Blacephalon will be able to sweep. Try to remove entry hazards before Blacephalon comes in so it doesn't take unnecessary damage and potentially get revenge killed. Double switch out if the opponent has a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar in order to retain momentum and avoid losing Blacephalon. As it is not holding a damage boosting item, Blacephalon's checks and counters are much more reliable, meaning it will have to switch out against anything it cannot kill. Choice Scarf Blacephalon cannot beat many bulky Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Porygon2. Switch out of Pokemon that carry paralysis-inflicting moves, as Blacephalon needs to maintain its Speed to be an effective revenge killer. Use Trick on predicted specially bulky switch-ins such as Chansey, Mantine, and Toxapex. Although Trick is useful for crippling the aforementioned threats, losing Choice Scarf means Blacephalon cannot revenge kill threats like Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko anymore, so be careful of using Trick when these Pokemon are still active. Try to lay down Stealth Rock before Blacephalon comes in, as Stealth Rock helps weaken Blacephalon's checks and counters while also removing Focus Sashes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a consistent revenge killer that can take out many foes because of its Speed tier, coverage, and power. As a result of this, Choice Specs Gengar is a good partner for Choice Scarf Blacephalon because they form an effective offensive core. Gengar can handle Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine, while Blacephalon is able to knock out Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny for Gengar. Mega Sableye pairs well with Blacephalon, as it can switch into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks that could potentially knock Blacephalon out as well as reflect entry hazards. Jellicent is a good partner for Blacephalon, as it can absorb Water-type attacks with Water Absorb while being able to break down many defensive threats such as Porygon2 and Mantine with Taunt. Alolan Marowak and Golurk support Blacephalon with Stealth Rock, which can break Focus Sashes and whittle down Blacephalon's checks in order for it to sweep with Choice Scarf as well as net important KOs such as Tapu Koko through Stealth Rock chip. Alolan Marowak can also switch into and beat Zapdos for Blacephalon. Decidueye and Dhelmise support Blacephalon by offering hazard control and switch-ins to Ground- and Water-type attacks because of their defensive typings. Decidueye and Dhelmise are both able to trap various threats, with Decidueye trapping Mantine and Dhelmise trapping Toxapex for Blacephalon. Mimikyu is a great partner for Blacephalon, as it knocks out Dark-types that could threaten Blacephalon such as Greninja, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar. Trick Room Ghost teams usually have slow Pokemon to take advantage of Trick Room so having Choice Scarf Blacephalon as a revenge killer helps outside of Trick Room.</p> "

  "Zeraora": {
    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Zeraora serves as a much-needed physical wallbreaker for Electric, bringing ample useful coverage moves and benefiting its team in means no other Electric-type can. Close Combat allows Zeraora to make waves in the Normal matchup, which Electric typically struggles with, especially in taking down Chansey. In addition, its access to Knock Off is extremely useful in further taking down the Normal defensive core, as well as removing items like Leftovers from other Pokemon that are looking to switch into Zeraora such as Hippowdon. Its blazing Speed allows it to outspeed nearly the entire unboosted metagame, barring Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Deoxys-S. It even can outspeed a few notable slower Choice Scarf users that threaten Electric such as Tapu Bulu. While Zeraora is Electric's go-to physical attacker, it still does face competition from the likes of Thundurus, which can very effectively remove conventional Zeraora checks such as Mega Venusaur and is overall very effective in the Poison matchup. To fill a similar role, Zeraora can also use a Flyinium Z set in order to remove Mega Venusaur and other bulky Grass-types, although that set lacks immediate power compared to its Choice Band sets. Zeraora's pure Electric typing leaves much to be desired, as it doesn't offer any unique beneficial secondary typing and leaves it very reliant on Plasma Fists as its strongest attack, except against foes weak to its coverage moves. Furthermore, its mediocre bulk means that it cannot easily switch into oncoming attacks except from Pokemon that do not threaten it at all, as it needs to remain healthy throughout the battle to continuously wallbreak.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>Outrage is a niche move that enables Zeraora to be more effective in the difficult Dragon matchup, most notably being able to outspeed and OHKO Mega Latias, an otherwise difficult Pokemon for Electric to handle, after prior chip damage. However, outside of this matchup, it seldom finds much use, and is setup bait for Dragon teams with Mega Altaria.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon: As Zeraora is reliant on using its STAB move, Plasma Fists, under Electric Terrain to blast past foes, Electric-immune Pokemon such as Diggersby and Excadrill prevent Zeraora from being effective as a wallbreaker and force it to rely on its coverage moves to tackle them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon- and Grass-types: Zeraora finds little use against both Dragon- and Grass-types, as they resist its primary STAB attack. Although certain Pokemon like Hydreigon and Ferrothorn are threatened by Zeraora's typical coverage, it has difficulty dealing with Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Although Zeraora has blazing high Speed, faster Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and most Choice Scarf Pokemon, including Victini and Excadrill, threaten Zeraora, forcing it out of the field.</p> <p><strong>Burns: As a physical wallbreaker, Zeraora is completely inhibited by burns, which prevent it from working as a wallbreaker at all. As such, it should avoid switching into Scald and should be wary of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: As a Choice-locked attacker, Zeraora is prone to being scouted by opposing Protect users like Toxapex and Celesteela. This enables the opponent to freely switch out to a teammate that can take on whatever move Zeraora has chosen.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Physically defensive walls such as Gliscor and Mew can take Zeraora's unboosted attacks comfortably and can force it out.</p> </section>",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Plasma Fists is Zeraora's most powerful physical STAB attack, dealing huge damage to foes especially under Electric Terrain. Close Combat is extremely handy coverage for Zeraora, allowing it to take on bulky Normal- and Steel-types like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn. Knock Off most importantly hits Psychic-types like Latios for big damage while also providing utility by removing items such as Eviolite and Choice Scarf. Iron Tail ensures Zeraora is effective against Fairy-types, most notably outspeeding and OHKOing Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu after minor chip while also helping with Mega Altaria; however, be wary of its low accuracy, only using it when completely necessary.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature ensures that Zeraora is as strong as possible while still outspeeding fast and threatening Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Volt Absorb is Zeraora's only ability, which can come in handy with Plasma Fists's secondary effect and also prevents foes like Zapdos from using Volt Switch to gain momentum. Choice Band boosts Zeraora's Attack, which enables it to gain notable 2HKOs such as against Porygon2.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As a physical wallbreaker, Zeraora is best used to continuously come in throughout the battle to force switches and deal huge blows while under Electric Terrain. Be sure to remove common Electric-immune Pokemon from the opponent's team such as Excadrill, Swampert, and Gliscor as soon as possible so that Zeraora can take full advantage of its powerful Plasma Fists in Electric Terrain. As Zeraora is the most vital Pokemon in the Normal matchup, use it sparingly to deal huge blows with Close Combat and take advantage of Knock Off to remove Eviolite from Chansey and Porygon2 to further aid its teammates in case it is unable to overcome the opponent alone. Take advantage of partners with a slow pivoting move such as Rotom-W and Zapdos to safely bring in Zeraora throughout the battle, giving Zeraora opportunities to wallbreak. Furthermore, avoid switching Zeraora directly into oncoming attacks, as it needs to remain healthy throughout the battle to be effective. In matchups where Zeraora is of little use such as Poison and Ground, try to take advantage of the utility of Knock Off as much as possible to attempt to disrupt the opposing team's item usage. Be wary of the defense drops that accompany Close Combat, as Zeraora will take huge blows following its use, leaving it easily checked, especially by Pokemon with priority such as Breloom and Dragonite. Considering Zeraora is a Choice-locked attacker, try to think ahead when choosing what move to use. An inappropriate choice can allow a foe to freely switch into Zeraora and can even allow a foe to punish Zeraora by using a setup move. Avoid burns at all costs, as they hinder Zeraora's physical prowess, inhibiting its function as a wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As the vast majority of Electric-types are special attackers, they all vastly appreciate Zeraora's function as a physical wallbreaker to remove specially defensive walls such as Chansey. Air Balloon Alolan Golem is an excellent partner, as it serves the double purpose of both a Stealth Rock setter, slowly chipping down foes for Zeraora, and a trapper, notably trapping and removing Choice Scarf Excadrill for Zeraora. Tapu Koko is a very important Pokemon for every Electric team due to its ability to set Electric Terrain upon switching in, which further boosts Zeraora's Plasma Fists, making it an even more potent wallbreaker. It also serves very well in the Dragon matchup, where, with Zeraora, it can take down Pokemon that otherwise wall most Electric-types. Alolan Raichu is another great partner for Zeraora as a special sweeper that greatly appreciates Zeraora's ability to remove special walls. In addition, Alolan Raichu can check Pokemon faster than Zeraora, including Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Excadrill, while under Electric Terrain. Additionally, Alolan Raichu can take on Poison-types that Zeraora can't do much against such as Mega Venusaur and Nidoking. Rotom-W and Zapdos are both amazing defensive partners that together help deal with Electric-immune Pokemon that Zeraora has difficulty with such as Hippowdon and Landorus. In addition, they can remove entry hazards from the field, act as slow pivots, and neuter foes with status. Rotom-W in particular can also take on Ground-types that Zeraora is unable to deal with such as Gliscor and Hippowdon. Thundurus can be another effective teammate in helping deal with the troublesome Normal matchup by providing additional Knock Off support and Fighting-type coverage. Additionally, Thundurus can help deal with Mega Venusaur with a Supersonic Skystrike set for Zeraora to effectively rip through the remainder of Poison-type teams.</p> "

        "name": "Flyinium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Plasma Fists is Zeraora's strongest Electric-type STAB move, which allows it to heavily damage any foe that doesn't resist it under Electric Terrain. Bounce is used in tandem with Flyinium Z in order to lure and take out problematic Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu. Close Combat is used as a solid coverage move that threatens various threats to Electric teams like Chansey and Ferrothorn. Bulk Up boosts Zeraora's physical capabilities to greater heights.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment coupled with a Jolly nature allows Zeraora to hit as hard and as fast as possible, all while outspeeding incredibly fast foes such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Flyinium Z is used in combination with Bounce in order to unleash Supersonic Skystrike. Volt Absorb gives Zeraora an immunity to Electric-type moves and can be useful for deterring Volt Switch pivoting.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zeraora can also be used as a late-game sweeper, as its incredible Speed stat enables it to outspeed nearly the entirety of the unboosted metagame, as well as slower boosted foes such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Mega Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance boost. Zeraora should keep in mind when to reveal Bulk Up, as utilizing the move alerts the opponent that Zeraora is the Z-Crystal user on the team. It should also avoid switching directly into attacks, as it must be kept as healthy as possible in order to effectively break down and sweep teams. Utilize the pivoting created from teammates such as Rotom-W and Tapu Koko to put Zeraora into favorable positions and gain momentum. Avoid burns from Will-O-Wisp users such as Mew, as they will heavily hamper Zeraora's damage output.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko provides Zeraora with a means of checking threatening Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Latias. It also provides Electric Terrain support that would slightly boost the power of Zeraora's Plasma Fists and can utilize Volt Switch in order to put it in favorable positions. Zapdos assists Zeraora with a critical Ground immunity that helps against foes such as Excadrill and Landorus while also providing utility functions that include Volt Switch to bring Zeraora into favorable postitions and Defog to remove entry hazards. Rotom-W provides another key Ground immunity for Zeraora, being able to check Ground-types such as Gliscor and Hippowdon through Hydro Pump as well as cripple physical checks such as Mega Gallade and Swampert through Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, it can use Volt Switch to keep up offensive pressure against the opponent and bring Zeraora in safely. Alolan Raichu can support Zeraora by threatening faster foes such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Greninja under Electric Terrain, while also checking more of the foes that Zeraora is meant to break down, such as Nidoking and Mega Venusaur. Alolan Golem provides utility for Zeraora as a Stealth Rock user that is also able to trap certain checks such as Excadrill when holding an Air Balloon.</p> "
