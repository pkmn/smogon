    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mold Breaker Mega Gengar can use Substitute to reduce reliance on Substitute-passing Wonder Guard users, or to continue its sweep if a passed Substitute gets broken. Boomburst is a powerful alternative to Secret Sword, maintains Mega Gengar's ability to Imposter-proof itself, and threatens Substitute + Baton Pass opponents like Wonder Guard Xerneas. King's Shield is an option to counter -ate Speed users, lowering their Attack while avoiding a turn of potential priority damage.</p> <p>Wonder Guard Mega Gengar can run a coverage move over Toxic Spikes to hit a specific Pokemon. It can also use status moves like Toxic or Will-O-Wisp over Toxic Spikes. Trick can put an opposing Pokemon on a timer with Black Sludge. Magic Coat can be used to reflect Encore and Taunt from Prankster Giratina and Mega Beedrill, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: The most common users of Pursuit—Huge Power Dark-types like Mega Gyarados and -ate Speed users like Diancie—can trap and OHKO Mega Gengar or force coinflip scenarios versus it if it has set up a Shell Smash. Drapion and Skuntank may sometimes run Pursuit as well. Wonder Guard sets are less affected, since they can simply use Baton Pass to escape.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Blissey and Mega Audino</strong>: Mold Breaker Mega Gengar usually has to pick between Secret Sword and Sludge Wave, so it won't be able to break both. Rarely, Mega Gengar will run both moves.</p> <p><strong>No Guard + Fissure</strong>: Mega Gengar is weak to ground, so even Wonder Guard sets will be OHKOed by Fissure.</p> <p><strong>Prankster or Faster Disruption</strong>: Prankster Pokemon like Giratina can punish Mold Breaker Mega Gengar's setup with Encore or punish an attack with Destiny Bond. It can also force Wonder Guard sets to switch with Encore. While Mega Gengar's Speed is high, even faster foes like Mega Beedrill can similarly hinder it with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Spikes</strong>: Mega Gengar's only recovery comes from its Black Sludge on Wonder Guard sets, meaning Stealth Rock and Spikes quickly wear it down.</p> <p><strong>-Ate Speed Users</strong>: -Ate Speed users such as Pixilate Mega Diancie and Aerilate Mega Rayquaza threaten Mega Gengar with STAB Extreme Speed + Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Many Mold Breaker users cannot switch in on Wonder Guard Mega Gengar's Shadow Ball, but they can threaten it if healthy.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre and Magic Guard Ho-Oh can survive a hit from +2 Mega Gengar and OHKO it through its paper-thin defenses or inflict debilitating status.</p> <p><strong>Beat Up</strong>: Beat Up is rare, but users of it such as Choice Band Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo X, and sometimes Mega Gyarados can OHKO Mega Gengar, even if it has a Substitute.</p>",

      "Mold Breaker (Mega Gengar)": {
        "description": "<p>Mold Breaker Mega Gengar is a strong sweeper that effectively does its job with the combination of Shell Smash and powerful Spooky Plate-boosted Judgment. Spooky Plate-boosted Judgment used in tandem with a partial Ghost typing makes Mega Gengar one of the most Imposter-proof Mold Breaker sweepers, as using Judgment without a Plate equipped makes it a Normal-type move. Sludge Wave is a strong STAB move that lets Mega Gengar beat common Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Mega Audino. Secret Sword allows Mega Gengar to attack Normal- and Dark-types, which resist or are immune to Judgment, while also offensively pressuring specially defensive support Pokemon like non-Imposter Chansey, Mega Gyarados, and Yveltal. In the last moveslot, Dark Void or Spore can effectively shut down switch-ins, generating more time to let Mega gengar set up or fire off more high-powered STAB moves. Notably, Mega Gengar benefits from putting Prankster Pokemon that intend to remove its boosts or KO it with a well-timed Destiny Bond to sleep. A Modest nature gives Mega Gengar a slight boost in power over Timid, but unboosted Modest Mega Gengar risks being outsped by rarer threats such as maximum Speed Arceus and Mega Rayquaza.</p> <p>Mega Gengar most effectively functions in combination with a Substitute-passing Wonder Guard pivot, allowing it to freely switch in and set up a Shell Smash. Additionally, Mega Gengar benefits from slow pivots that can build momentum by switching it in against a poorly matched opposing Pokemon. Switch-ins equipped with a Focus Sash have the greatest chance of countering Mega Gengar, so entry hazard setters like Wonder Guard Arceus and Mega Scizor are strongly recommended as teammates. Additionally, because of the lack of recovery, Mega Gengar struggles to survive long games without Wish and Defog support from Wonder Guard users and high-HP support Pokemon like Giratina, Xerneas, and Arceus. Finally, item removal support can give Mega Gengar the upper hand, namely by removing Safety Goggles from foes so Mega Gengar can put them to sleep or immobilizing bulky Pokemon that resist Mega Gengar's moves by Tricking a Choice item onto them.</p>"

      "Wonder Guard (Mega Gengar)": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Gengar uses its unique typing and Wonder Guard to switch in on many attacks and use Substitute + Baton Pass for a teammate. Shadow Ball threatens Giratina so it can't safely switch in to use Encore, as well as threatening many Mold Breaker users. Toxic Spikes is used, since not only does Mega Gengar absorb it later if Magic Bounce reflects it, but it forces a free turn later when the opponent must use Defog to remove them. Sludge Wave can be used over Toxic Spikes to hit Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Audino, as well as providing strong neutral coverage against Pokemon like Mega Gyarados. Taunt is an option to prevent moves like Defog, Aromatherapy, and Whirlwind, as well as shutting down status users like Giratina.</p> <p>Wonder Guard Mega Gengar fits best on fast-paced Mold Breaker offense teams in need of Substitute passers for momentum. It stands out in this capacity by compressing multiple roles, like entry hazard user, No Guard check, and Substitue passer, which lets these teams fit more Mold Breaker users to make progress—most notably Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza. Primal Groudon in particular appreciates Mega Gengar weakening Giratina so it can more easily break through. Since Mega Gengar does not typically run moves like Defog and Aromatherapy to sustain momentum, Wonder Guard clerics like Mega Audino and Blissey complement it well.</p>"

  "Arceus": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For support Wonder Guard Arceus, an alternate EV Spread of 248 HP / 148 Def / 96 SpD / 16 Spe and a Bold nature can be used alongside Knock Off to soft check Mold Breaker Mega Gengar. This EV spread allows Arceus to survive +2 Mega Gengar's Sludge Wave after Stealth Rock while also avoiding the KO from +2 Secret Sword. This is noteworthy, as every other Normal-type Wonder Guard user bar Meloetta struggles versus unscouted Mega Gengar. Alternatively, a fully specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature can be used alongside Knock Off to check other Plate + Judgment Mold Breaker sweepers such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sceptile while still checking Mega Gengar lacking Secret Sword. However, such a set sacrifices Arceus's ability to scout Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, and other physical attackers effectively. 0 Speed EVs and IVs and a Relaxed nature can be used alongside Parting Shot or Baton Pass to provide slow pivoting support to Arceus’s team. However, Arceus is usually outclassed by Slaking in this role, comma since Arceus's naturally high Speed means it is still undersped by most opposing slow pivots such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre.</p> <p>Like all support Wonder Guard users, Arceus has a panoply of useful utility options available to it. Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web are alternative entry hazard options over Stealth Rock. Glare and Will-O-Wisp can be used to punish incoming Mold Breaker users and Huge Power users, while Dark Void, Spore, and Taunt are all decent options with Arceus's good Speed tier. Whirlwind helps versus some setup sweepers, synergizes well with Stealth Rock and, perhaps more importantly, forces out Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users like Xerneas. Keep in mind, however, that all of the aforementioned options can be reflected with a timely Magic Bounce switch in and leave Arceus very vulnerable to Taunt. Nuzzle is an alternative to Glare that trades the ability to paralyze Wonder Guard users and Primal Groudon for a better matchup against Magic Bounce users and Taunt users. Similarly, Perish Song is an alternative to Whirlwind that has a slightly worse matchup versus Wonder Guard Substitute + Baton Pass users, but isn't reflected by the aforementioned Magic Bounce. Magic Coat is another option to reflect entry hazards, sleep moves from Mold Breaker users, and Sing, Gastro Acid, Taunt, and Spider Web from No Guard users. Finally, Steam Eruption can also be used over a utility move to OHKO standard Primal Groudon sets and to 2HKO Mega Diancie, although it hits very few targets otherwise and has very limited PP.</p> <p>Safety Goggles improve Arceus's matchup versus Mold Breaker users that run Spore and can give Arceus a leg up versus Imposter users if Arceus itself opts to use Spore. Any of the seventeen Plates are options to give Arceus an immunity to Trick. Chesto Berry is an extremely niche option that can be used alongside the aforementioned Knock Off to make Arceus a more consistent check to Mold Breaker Mega Gengar. Lastly, Chople Berry is another very fringe option that can allow Arceus to survive a singular Drain Punch from Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X. However, note that all of these options leave Wonder Guard Arceus very vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, so consider running them alongside a pivoting move such as Baton Pass or Parting Shot to give Arceus counterplay versus trapping.</p> <p>For Mold Breaker Arceus, a Timid nature can be run to outpace Modest Mega Gengar, Adamant Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Rayquaza running a positive Speed nature, letting Arceus heavily damage or KO them with Judgment. On sets that opt for King's Shield, an EV spread of 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe can be used to maximize bulk while still outspeeding Adamant Primal Groudon before Shell Smash, as outpacing threats such as Choice Band Mega Rayquaza before setup is less of a concern. Alternatively, a spread of 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe can be used for additional bulk and outpacing Jolly Primal Groudon and other positive nature base 90 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Mold Breaker Arceus can opt to use a third coverage move in the last moveslot—such as Secret Sword, Earth Power, or Steam Eruption—but doing so makes Arceus more reliant on its teammates to set up safely and can make Imposter-proofing more difficult. Recover is another option, especially on teams with Pursuit + Huge Power teammates, that capitalizes on Arceus’s good bulk and ability to overwhelm teams once opposing Giratina are removed. Stealth Rock takes advantage of Boomburst's ability to force switches. Items such as Safety Goggles, Leftovers, Lum Berry, and Mental Herb are options—alongside a coverage move over Judgment—that can ease setup on teams with Huge Power + Pursuit users, but they are almost never worth sacrificing the immunity to Trick and the additional power that Spooky Plate or Dread Plate and Judgment provide.</p> <p>It's also worth noting that on teams with three or more Arceus—often refered to as spam teams—fringe Arceus sets such as Prankster, No Guard, Choice Band Huge Power, Huge Power Fake Out + Extreme Speed, Fist Plate Wonder Guard Shell Smash, Spooky Plate Multitype, and Magic Bounce have significantly increased viability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Fighting Coverage</strong>: Powerful Fighting-type attacks from Huge Power and Protean users will force Wonder Guard Arceus out. In particular, Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X can OHKO Arceus with any of its STAB attacks, even OHKOing Chople Berry Arceus with Low Kick or Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Like most defensive Wonder Guard users, Prankster Giratina can come in on virtually every variation of Wonder Guard support Arceus and force it out with Encore or chip it with Will-O-Wisp or Curse. And while Prankster Giratina doesn't want to come in on a powerful Ghost- or Dark-type Judgment, its presence, particularly alongside a Normal- or Dark-type teammate, prevents Mold Breaker variants of Arceus from freely using Boomburst or Shell Smash. However, Giratina can be overwhelmed if Mold Breaker Arceus puts it to sleep or uses Taunt as it switches in, which gives it chances to set up with Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Unless it's holding a Plate, Trick users can hinder Wonder Guard Arceus for the entirety of the match. Since most Arceus sets forgo a pivoting move, it’s even more of a momentum sink with a Choice item than other support Wonder Guard users. In addition, loss of its Shed Shell leaves Arceus especially vulnerable to being removed by Shadow Tag users.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt shuts Wonder Guard Arceus down completely unless it chooses to run non-status utility options such as Knock Off, Nuzzle, and Steam Eruption.</p> <p><strong>Choice Item Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Powerful Mold Breaker users like Choice Band Primal Groudon, Choice Band Mega Rayquaza, and Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y can all force Arceus out; Primal Groudon's V-create OHKOes after Stealth Rock, Mega Rayquaza can wear Arceus down and waste its Recover PP with repeated usage of Dragon Ascent, and Mega Mewtwo Y's Psycho Boost OHKOes after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Unless Mold Breaker Arceus is carrying King's Shield, -ate Speed users such as Pixilate Mega Diancie and Aerilate Mega Rayquaza can force it out. In particular, 252 HP EV Mega Diancie can survive a +2 Boomburst and +2 Ghost-type Judgment, and it is even less threatened by Dread Plate variants. On the other hand, Huge Power Mega Gyarados, another very popular revenge killer, needs all five hits of Water Shuriken to connect in order to revenge kill -1 Defense Arceus—though Arceus still needs to be wary of Sucker Punch variants.</p> <p><strong>Faster Powerful Attackers</strong>: Powerful attackers that outpace Arceus, such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Mewtwo X, can threaten to OHKO Mold Breaker Arceus and force it out. In addition, Mold Breaker Arceus is also vulnerable to OHKO moves from faster No Guard users like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Manectric.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Fast and powerful Shadow Tag users, such as Mega Mewtwo X and Choice Scarf Primal Groudon, can trap and KO Mold Breaker Arceus, especially if Arceus is chipped or running few defensive EVs.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Mold Breaker Arceus has trouble breaking through specially defensive titans such as Blissey and RegenVest users like Yveltal and Primal Kyogre. While rare and vulnerable to Spore or Dark Void, RegenVest users can annoy Arceus by phazing it with Circle Throw, using Nuzzle, or pivoting out to a revenge killer or Prankster user; Wonder Guard Blissey can disrupt Arceus with Glare or Whirlwind.</p>",

      "Wonder Guard Support": {
        "description": "<p>A unique combination of excellent bulk, high Speed, and only one weakness makes Arceus a strong choice for a support Wonder Guard user. Like all support Wonder Guard users, Arceus has some flexibility with the utility moves it can run. Stealth Rock gives Arceus a way to make progress in nearly every game, especially since Wonder Guard users inherently force switches against many non-Mold Breaker foes. Gastro Acid is another option that takes advantage of Arceus's good Speed tier to wall slower Mold Breaker foes such as Adamant Primal Groudon and Mega Tyranitar, as well as halving the power of any Huge Power users Arceus finds itself facing. It can also pressure opposing Wonder Guard users, especially those using Baton Pass, as Gastro Acid's ability suppression is passed as well. Defog and Aromatherapy are extremely valuable utility moves on nearly every team composition. However, if either one is already being provided by a teammate, then King's Shield can be used as a scouting tool versus foes like Mega Mewtwo X and to improve Arceus's matchup versus Choice Band Mold Breaker users like Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza. In addition, King's Shield makes Wish a more reliable recovery option for Arceus. On sets lacking King's Shield, however, Recover is usually preferred for its immediacy and reliability. Shed Shell is the preferred item so that Arceus can escape being trapped by Shadow Tag users. A physically defensive EV spread effectively scouts physical Mold Breaker users such as Choice Band Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza; 16 Speed EVs allow Arceus to outpace Adamant Primal Groudon and neutralize it with Gastro Acid.</p> <p>Many team structures appreciate the utility Arceus can provide. However, since Arceus doesn't provide pivoting support effectively, Wonder Guard users that can do so, such as Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas, form effective Wonder Guard cores with Arceus. In addition, Arceus itself appreciates Xerneas's Substitutes giving it additional turns to utilize its utility moves or to force out opposing Mold Breaker users with Gastro Acid. In return, Arceus can scout Mold Breaker Mega Gengar and neutralize Mold Breaker Primal Groudon with Gastro Acid, two of Wonder Guard Xerneas's most common switch-ins. Thanks to its singular weakness to Fighting, Wonder Guard Arceus also makes an excellent teammate for Huge Power, Protean, and Parental Bond teammates such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios lacking Fighting attacks, as it can serve as a switch-in to Imposter users. Finally, because of Arceus's own vulnerability to Fighting-type attackers like Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, teammates that match up well against it, such as Aerilate Mega Rayquaza, Pixilate Mega Diancie, Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir, and Prankster Will-O-Wisp Giratina, are appreciated.</p>"

      "Mold Breaker + Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>With its powerful STAB Boomburst, immunity to Trick and Knock Off, straightforward Imposter-proofing, excellent bulk, and good Speed tier, Mold Breaker Arceus is an excellent option for a Shell Smash sweeper. Boomburst's STAB-augmented 140 Base Power allows Arceus to OHKO and 2HKO large swathes of the metagame at +2—the only exceptions being Ghost-types and extremely specially bulky Pokemon, such as Wonder Guard Blissey and the rare Assault Vest Primal Kyogre. Either Spooky Plate or Dread Plate give Judgment near-perfect coverage alongside Boomburst and, due to an Arceus-specific mechanic, also grants Arceus an immunity to Trick and Knock Off. Both also make it easy to Imposter-proof, as a Ghost-type teammate can cover any Imposter user that lacks a Plate item. Spooky Plate gives Arceus better overall coverage, as the only relevant threat that resists both Ghost and Normal is Mega Tyranitar, while Dread Plate eases prediction against teams that have both Prankster Giratina and a Normal- or Dark-type, such as Wonder Guard Slaking or Mega Audino. Arceus's final moveslot is devoted to disruption, aiding it either in setting up a Shell Smash or in continuing a sweep. Dark Void and Spore create setup opportunities by inflicting sleep; Spore has perfect accuracy and makes Imposter-proofing even easier with a Safety Goggles teammate, though it's worse against opposing Safety Goggles users, Mega Abomasnow, and the rare Wonder Guard Ludicolo. Taunt aids Arceus primarily versus Prankster Giratina and Wonder Guard Blissey, which otherwise come in on Arceus without too much difficulty and force it out with Encore and Whirlwind, respectively. Finally, King's Shield can halt -ate Speed users like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Diancie attempting to stop Arceus’s sweep. 216 Speed EVs are used to outpace neutral-natured Mega Rayquaza.</p> <p>Mold Breaker Arceus fits best on balance and offense teams that can give it opportunities to set up. In particular, Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir are excellent teammates, as they both give Arceus free turns with Substitute and threaten Prankster Giratina for it with their powerful Moonblasts. Similarly, No Guard-using teammates, such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Lopunny, generate free turns for Arceus by forcing in Wonder Guard users with their OHKO moves. Huge Power Dark-types, such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar, also make strong teammates for Pursuit trapping the metagame's premier Ghost-type, Giratina, allowing Arceus to use Boomburst more freely. Mold Breaker Arceus also appreciates having at least one Ghost-type teammate, such as Giratina, Wonder Guard Mega Sableye, Wonder Guard Dusclops, or Mega Gengar, to efficiently Imposter-proof it. Secret Sword Mega Gengar is a particularly noteworthy partner on offense teams for providing good role compression; it can be a second Mold Breaker sweeper, Imposter-proof both itself and Arceus, and threaten common switch-ins to Arceus like Prankster Giratina and Wonder Guard Blissey. Level 2 Wonder Guard Mega Sableye both provides an extremely slow pivot with Baton Pass and efficiently Imposter-proofs Dark Void variants of Arceus thanks to its Flame Orb—which many methods to Imposter-proof Spore Arceus, like Safety Goggles, can't do.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternate EV Spread of 80 Def / 252 SpA / 176 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Jolly Primal Groudon and other maximum Speed base 90 Pokemon before Mega Gardevoir uses Shell Smash, in addition to giving it the ability to survive Choice Band Adamant Mold Breaker Primal Groudon’s Extreme Speed before Mega Gardevoir uses Shell Smash and non-Choice Band Extreme Speed after a Shell Smash. This spread, however, is generally only worth using in tandem with either Water coverage like Scald or Steam Eruption or on niche Choice Specs Mold Breaker sets with Psycho Boost that can OHKO Primal Groudon without requiring a boost first. Thanks to Mega Gardevoir’s physical frailty, further defensive investment is generally inadvisable.</p> <p>Mega Gardevoir has a wide range of other viable coverage options; Bug Buzz hits Psychic-type Wonder Guard users, Aura Sphere hits Normal-type Wonder Guard users not named Blissey harder than Secret Sword, Scald OHKOes Primal Groudon, and Giga Drain hits Water-type Wonder Guard users while also providing recovery. Gastro Acid is also an option over a coverage move to allow Mega Gardevoir to break through Wonder Guard users of any type at the somewhat steep cost of an additional turn to do so. In addition, while Stealth Rock is hard to fit, Mega Gardevoir’s ability to threaten out the format’s most popular Magic Bouncers—Giratina and Yveltal—make it a reliable entry hazard setter.</p> <p>Mega Gardevoir is also a very competent user of Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard sets, but faces fierce competition from the much bulkier Xerneas for this role. However, it is worth noting that Mega Gardevoir specifically utilizes Glare and Shell Smash variants of these sets just as efficiently, if not better, than Xerneas can in many scenarios. Mold Breaker sets with either Choice Specs or Shell Smash are also a niche option. However, the former faces steep competition with Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y and even the rare Choice Specs Mega Diancie and the latter is only useful over similar Mega Diancie sets if STAB Stored Power or Psystrike is greatly desired.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Mega Gardevoir’s physical frailty means it cannot switch into or stomach any reasonably strong physical hits bar Fighting type attacks. A Choice Band or Huge Power boosted hit that makes it through Mega Gardevoir’s Wonder Guard will almost always KO. In addition, super effective priority moves such as Shadow Sneak and Bullet Punch—most frequently seen on Shadow Tag and Huge Power Regigigas and Slaking sets—bypass Gardevoir’s Wonder Guard and KO it outright.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mold Breaker Mega Gengar puts a lot of pressure on Mega Gardevoir, outspeeding and OHKOing it with Spooky Plate Judgment or Sludge Wave. However, Mega Gengar cannot switch into Mega Gardevoir effectively, especially if Gardevoir is carrying Spooky Plate or is already boosted.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Wonder Guard</strong>: Because Wonder Guard sweepers are inherently matchup dependent, Wonder Guard users that Mega Gardevoir is not packing the correct coverage move for will force it out.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Trick, Switcheroo, and Mold Breaker Knock Off can severely impede Mega Gardevoir’s ability to do its job, removing one third of its coverage as well as its ability to beat Imposter users.</p> <p><strong>Plate Imposter Users</strong>: While rare and very suboptimal outside of a matchup into offensive Wonder Guard Mega Gardevoir or Xerneas (or Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, in the case of Spooky Plate), Imposter Pokemon holding an Iron Plate or Spooky Plate directly counter this set and can be difficult to deal with.</p>",

      "Wonder Guard Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Gardevoir’s excellent Psychic / Fairy typing and high base 165 Special Attack make it one of the best options for a Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweeper. Judgment and either Iron Plate or Spooky Plate allow this set to beat Imposter users, as well as Fairy-type or Psychic-type Wonder Guard users, respectively. Thanks to the evergreen popularity of Wonder Guard Xerneas, Iron Plate is usually preferred, but Spooky Plate does have additional utility outside of hitting Psychic-type Wonder Guard users—notably +2 Spooky Plate Judgment OHKOes Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios, as well as standard Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock. The remaining moveslots are dedicated to coverage for breaking as many Wonder Guard cores and Mold Breaker switch-ins as possible and are, as a result, quite flexible and very team-dependent. Grass Knot and Freeze-Dry are powerful coverage options that, most notably, allow this set to beat the ever popular Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre. On Iron Plate sets, Grass Knot is usually preferred for the OHKO on Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock at +2. Freeze-Dry nails a broader range of threats, however, including OHKOing Wonder Guard Gyaradosite Gyarados and Mega Rayquaza. Moonblast is a powerful STAB move that is often Mega Gardevoir’s best option against non-Wonder Guard switch-ins and also OHKOes the somewhat common Wonder Guard Mega Sableye. It also OHKOes standard Giratina sets even at just +1. Secret Sword and Lava Plume smack Normal and Bug / Steel type Wonder Guards, respectively, while Earth Power is notable for hitting both Electric Wonder Guard users and netting a guaranteed KO against Primal Groudon at +2. Mix and match these (or other) coverage options according to your team’s needs and current metagame trends. A Modest nature is preferred to secure several key KOs such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Rayquaza, but a Timid nature is an option if outpacing Timid Xerneas is desired.</p> <p>Wonder Guard Shell Smash Mega Gardevoir fits well on both balance and offensive teams as a powerful wincon. Physical Mold Breakers, though valuable on nearly every team structure in ORAS Pure Hackmons, are especially important teammates for Mega Gardevoir, breaking through the Wonder Guard users Mega Gardevoir’s chosen coverage moves may not pierce. Choice Band Primal Groudon is especially noteworthy for its excellent offensive synergy with Mega Gardevoir, as well as its ability to obliterate opposing Wonder Guard users with its STAB V-create. Fast and powerful Mold Breaker users such as Mega Mewtwo Y and especially Mega Gengar can make it very difficult for Gardevoir to get a Shell Smash up, so teammates such as Yveltal, Mega Gyarados, Wonder Guard Meloetta, Arceus carrying Knock Off, and various -ate Speed users like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Abomasnow are appreciated. Many of these Pokemon are also good entry hazard setters, and Mega Gardevoir appreciates Stealth Rock support to turn many of its already favorable rolls, such as +2 Spooky Plate Judgment or Grass Knot into 240 HP Primal Groudon, into guaranteed KOs. Aromatherapy support from support Wonder Guard partners with complementary typing such as Primal Kyogre, Meloetta, Slaking, and Mega Scizor, among others, is also appreciated to prevent Toxic or Will-O-Wisp from putting a timer on Mega Gardevoir’s sweep. Defog and Wish support from these teammates can also offset any chip Mega Gardevoir might take throughout a game, making its job as a late-game cleaner and wincon more flexible.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>116 Speed EVs can be used outpace and escape Huge Power Yveltal's Pursuit, though doing so comes at the cost of Cresselia's survivability versus Mold Breaker users, as well as the ability to underspeed minimum Speed Wonder Guard Arceus. A specially defensive set, though hard to justify when Cresselia is so effective at scouting physically offensive Mold Breakers, is also an option to improve Cresselia's matchup against Choice Specs Mold Breaker users and to let it survive a single Bug Buzz from Protean Latios. Colbur Berry is another option to improve Cresselia's matchup against Pursuit trappers, allowing it to risk the 50 / 50 a single time versus Mega Gyarados; however, forgoing Shed Shell comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to Shadow Tag users like Perish Song Lugia. Safety Goggles is another option that can allow Cresselia to soft check some Spore Mold Breaker Shell Smash sweepers alongside either Whirlwind or Glare—although it similarly leaves Cresselia vulnerable to Shadow Tag users. Mail is a final option to make Cresselia immune to Trick.</p> <p>Though a little difficult to fit, Glare is an option to punish Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar that Cresselia lures in. Similarly, Will-O-Wisp is an option to cripple incoming Huge Power users, continuously chip special attackers lacking recovery, and to limit the number of times Substitute + Baton Pass users like Xerneas and Mega Mewtwo Y can use Substitute. Substitute can be used alongside Baton Pass, but this role is typically filled better by less passive Wonder Guard users, such as Xerneas. Perish Song is an alternative to Whirlwind to put any opponent, but especially Whirlwind-immune Substitute + Baton Pass Magic Bounce users, on a timer. Magic Coat is an option to reflect sleep moves from Mold Breaker users like Primal Groudon looking to use Cresselia as a setup opportunity, as well as Parting Shot and Stealth Rock from -ate Speed users like Mega Abomasnow and Sing, Gastro Acid, Taunt, and Spider Web from No Guard users. Finally, a set with both King's Shield and Baton Pass is viable, but it severely limits the utility Cresselia can offer its team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Huge Power Pursuit</strong>: Despite measures to mitigate Cresselia's weakness to Pursuit, it is still very vulnerable to Huge Power Pursuit users like Mega Gyarados and Yveltal. Even if running additional speed EVs to outpace Yveltal, Cresselia still has to be wary of being trapped while paralyzed or afflicted with a Speed drop from Sticky Web, especially since Cresselia is often the team's cleric and entry hazard remover. Sets lacking Baton Pass have to be played even more carefully in a matchup versus Huge Power Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Thanks to its Dark-type weakness, Cresselia is vulnerable to having its Shed Shell removed by Knock Off, leaving it vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, or just being outright KOed by Dark-type Huge Power users.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Unless it's holding Mail, Trick users can hinder Cresselia for the entirety of the match, forcing it to either use Baton Pass or relinquish momentum.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Shell Smash Mold Breakers like Mega Gengar, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus can swap in on nearly every Cresselia set risk free use it as setup fodder. In addition, if Cresselia forgoes King's Shield, it's also forced out without much difficulty by Choice Band Primal Groudon.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Like is the case with most defensive Wonder Guard users, Prankster Giratina can come in on virtually every Cresselia set and force it out with Encore, chip it with Will-O-Wisp, or leave it vulnerable to Pursuit trapping with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Unfavorable Matchup</strong>: Despite its impressive bulk, like any Wonder Guard user, Cresselia is still vulnerable to being OHKOed by powerful foes carrying the right coverage such as Beat Up Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X and Bug Buzz Protean Mega Latios. King's Shield variants of Cresselia, however, can scout the aforementioned foes and somewhat mitigate the disadvantage of an unfavorable matchup.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its titanic bulk, decent Speed tier, and good pure Psychic typing, Cresselia is an excellent support Wonder Guard user, reliably providing cleric support, Wish passing, entry hazard removal, entry hazard setting, and pivoting support for its teammates. In addition to the utility a pivoting move provides, Baton Pass also allows Cresselia to escape its greatest enemy—Pursuit—provided it is faster than its foe. Thankfully, Cresselia is naturally faster than the most common Pursuit user, Huge Power Mega Gyarados. Alternatively, King's Shield eases Cresselia's matchup versus Pursuit users while also improving Cresselia's matchup against powerful physical foes like Choice Band Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza. Defog and Aromatherapy are extremely valuable support options on the majority of team structures, but if another teammate is carrying either one, Cresselia can also opt to support its team with Stealth Rock instead. Whirlwind is another option that synergizes well with entry hazards and allows Cresselia to force out Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users like Xerneas. Finally, recovery is essential for this set to function. Recover's immediate recovery is usually superior on sets lacking King's Shield, while Wish allows Cresselia to support its teammates and has good synergy with both King's Shield and Baton Pass. Shed Shell is the preferred item, as it makes Cresselia much more resilient against Shadow Tag users, requiring a teammate to remove its item with Trick or Knock Off before it can be trapped. A physically defensive EV spread is used to better scout Choice Band Mold Breaker users, as Cresselia's typing and natural bulk allow it to switch into the likes of Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Rayquaza once even without investment. A Bold Nature and 31 Speed IVs allow Cresselia to outspeed opposing Mega Gyarados with no Speed EVs, allowing it to escape Mega Gyarados's Pursuit with Baton Pass. Alternatively, if vulnerability to Pursuit trappers isn't a concern, a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs can be used to allow Cresselia to underspeed other common slow pivots such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre.</p> <p>Like is the case with all support Wonder Guard users, most teams benefit from the utility Cresselia can provide in the form of Aromatherapy, entry hazard removal or setting, pivoting, and Wish passing. In addition, Cresselia can also support Huge Power or Protean teammates lacking a Dark-, Bug-, or Ghost-type attack as a switch-in for them against Imposter users. Cresselia can similarly support Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Rayquaza against Imposter users. Wonder Guard Xerneas is a particularly notable teammate for Cresselia, as it has an excellent matchup against Huge Power Mega Gyarados and other Pursuit trappers in addition to forming a strong Wonder Guard core with it. Alternatively, Cresselia can also pair well with offensive Wonder Guard users like Mega Lucario and Shell Smash Xerneas thanks to their positive matchup into Pursuit users, as well as Cresselia's own ability to effectively compress the roles of cleric and defogger. Offensive Shadow Tag users that aren't weak to Water, such as a Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X, also make effective teammates for Cresselia, as they can trap and remove the aforementioned Mega Gyarados. Ironically, Cresselia's greatest nemeses—Huge Power Dark-types like Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal—are also stellar teammates for it, serving as offensive checks against Shell Smash Mold Breaker users, especially with Sucker Punch. Similarly, -ate Speed users such as Mega Rayquaza and Mega Abomasnow are also excellent teammates for that same ability to check and revenge kill Shell Smash Mold Breaker users. In addition, -ate Speed users are excellent entry hazard setters and can either form a entry hazard stacking core with Cresselia or free up a moveslot for Whirlwind or other utility move.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Beedrill can run Recover for better sustainability than Black Sludge. However, it is too frail to use Recover well. Toxic Spikes is a pretty good option, since Mega Beedrill can remove them itself if they are reflected by Magic Bounce or put up by an Imposter user. Gunk Shot is also an option to OHKO Xerneas. Spore can work for even more disruption. Dark Void is also usable to bypass opposing Safety Goggles, even if Imposter matchups become harder. A Substitute + Baton Pass set can take advantage of Mega Beedrill's Speed to use Baton Pass before the Substitute is broken. though it's mostly outclassed here by better-typed Pokemon like Mega Manectric. A No Guard set can be viable due to Mega Beedrill's high Speed and ability to bluff Wonder Guard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Rayquaza</strong>: All sets of Mega Rayquaza can come in and threaten Mega Beedrill with a Flying-type move such as Dragon Ascent, Aeroblast, or Aerilate-boosted Extreme Speed, forcing it to switch out. Moreover, Mega Beedril can't do much to Mega Rayquaza in return besides chipping it with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag + Choice Scarf Revenge Killers</strong>: Shadow Tag + Choice Scarf users like Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon freely switch into Mega Beedrill, outspeed it, prevent its switch, and annihilate it with a super effective move. Even Shed Shell Mega Beedrill may have its Shed Shell removed.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Mega Beedrill is weak to Rock and is reliant on Black Sludge or Wish support for recovery, meaning it is easy to wear down with Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon running a Fire-type move can OHKO Mega Beedril. However, Gastro Acid Mega Beedrill sets can stop mono-attacking Primal Groudon without Speed boosts or Choice Scarf. Primal Groudon also dislikes taking Black Sludge from Trick, and even sets with a Fire-type move are vulnerable to Destiny Bond if they lack Speed boosting.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Mega Beedrill sets without Taunt can't do much to Giratina, which can invalidate Mega Beedrill with Encore and force it to switch out. Will-O-Wisp and Curse can negate Mega Beedrill's recovery, and Glare can remove it's biggest asset compared to other Wonder Guard users: its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt can stop Mega Beedrill from doing anything besides using U-turn and switching out. When paired with Stealth Rock, Taunt forcing Mega Beedrill out can stop it from getting much done.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Magic Bounce users can come in freely on Mega Beedrill and prevent it from Spikes, Taunt, or Gastro Acid. Mega Beedrill will be forced into an unwanted switch. However, all Magic Bounce users except the occasional Mega Venusaur and Griseous Orb Giratina-O are susceptible to Trick + Black Sludge, which hinders them for the rest of the match.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A somewhat uncommon Poison typing allows Mega Beedrill to remove Toxic Spikes upon switching in. U-turn takes advantage of Mega Beedrill's Speed, allowing it to maintain momentum against the likes of Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Latios, Mega Gyarados, Meloetta, Cresselia and allows you to pivot out from magic bounce users such as Giratina while doing immense damage with its high Attack stat. U-turn also pivots it out against Magic Bounce users such as Giratina. Gastro Acid with its amazing Speed prevents damage from slower Mold Breaker users not carrying a Super effective attack, as well as most Wonder Guard users. Additionally, Gastro Acid’s effect persisting through Baton Pass often forces slow-pivot Wonder Guard users to hard switch, allowing Mega Beedrill to further maintain momentum. Trick alongside Black Sludge hinders Substitute + Baton Pass users like Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Manectric for the entirety of the games. Also, it continually chips passive foes and deprives them of their Shed Shells, Safety Goggles, or Leftovers. Spikes and Stealth Rock wear down opposing Pokemon without recovery, such as many Mold Breaker users, Mega Gyarados, and most Shadow Tag users, while hindering Substitute + Baton Pass and Magic Bounce users and magic bounce users. Taunt forces out opposing support Wonder Guard users and Prankster Giratina, and it has excellent synergy with Spikes or Stealth Rock, allowing multiple layers of Spikes to go up while denying opposing Defog. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp both provide heavy chip damage. Will-O-Wisp can cause nasty burns that hinder most Physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Gyarados, or Mega Rayqauza. However Toxic finds itself usually as the preferred option due to the fact it has higher accuracy, doesn't get thrown back at you from Magic bounce Pokemon and is much stronger chip damage, and places a timer on opponents. Finally, Destiny Bond is an option that can often take a surprise KO thanks to Mega Beedrill’s high Speed. Black Sludge offsets chip damage from hazards and status and is doubly useful if Mega Beedrill is making use of Trick. Shed Shell improves Mega Beedrill’s matchup versus Choice Scarf Shadow Tag users like Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza.</p> <p>Support Wonder Guard Mega Beedrill works well on a variety of team archetypes, but especially balance, offense and bulky offense teams, which appreciate it forcing switches with Taunt, Trick, or Gastro Acid and setting entry hazards. Additionally, they especially appreciate Mega Beedrill’s ability to soak up Toxic Spikes upon switching in. Mega Beedrill greatly appreciates Wish and slow pivoting support from other support Wonder Guard users like Primal Kyogre and Blissey, particularly if it forgoes Black Sludge. The capacity for Trick + Black Sludge variants to remove Shed Shells synergizes well with Shadow Tag users, like Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X, Perish Song Lugia, Choice Scarf Rayquaza, and Choice Scarf Primal Groudon. Mega Gyarados with Water Shuriken and Pursuit can revenge kill Primal Groudon variants that can trap Mega Beedril, as well as Pursuit trapping Giratina, which can stop Beedrill's antics with Prankster, Encore, and Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users like Xerneas and Mega Manectric appreciate Mega Beedrill forcing out Mold Breaker users and Giratina with Gastro Acid and Taunt, respectively, as this often gives them a free Substitute turn.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blissey is an option over Chansey for sets that forgo Eviolite, but revealing that your Imposter user is running an item other than Eviolite, like Choice Scarf, generally is not worth the slight increase in HP. Shed Shell allows Chansey to escape traps that utilize Shadow Tag or trapping moves like Thousand Waves. In order to have a greater chance of beating an Imposter-proofed sweeper, which usually rely on Judgement, Chansey can run a Plate. Iron Plate allows it to beat Wonder Guard Xerneas, Spooky Plate counters Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, and Pixie Plate provides Fairy Judgment against Mold Breaker Mega Diancie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Imposter-proofed Sweepers</strong>: Some sweepers, like Mega Gengar, Mega Diancie, Arceus, and Dialga, may run sets that can't be effectively copied by Chansey, allowing for safe setup. Judgement is a common Imposter-proofing move, as it requires a Plate to change type, and can be used to prevent Chansey from checking the sweeper. Additionally, sweepers behind a Substitute, typically through Substitute + Baton Pass support, prevents Imposter from activating and are problematic if Chansey is the only revenge killer on its team.</p> <p><strong>Imposter-proofed Utility</strong>: Some utility Pokemon aim to trap and eliminate Chansey with Shadow Tag, such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Mewtwo X. However, Choice Scarf Chansey that has already copied a boosted Shell Smash sweeper will usually outspeed said Shadow Tag users, making counterplay through trapping shaky at best.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Imposter Chansey is one of the most effective utility Pokemon due to its ability to scout the opponent's sets in a metagame where every move is a possibility. Instantly copying the opponent's typing, stats, boosts, and movepool while retaining its massive 250 base HP and the defensive boost from Eviolite forces the opponent to face a much bulkier version of the set they built themselves. Scouting is Chansey's main utility, as this can help the player identify weaknesses in the opponent's team and potentially use their own strategy against them. Eviolite is generally the preferred item to give Chansey truly titanic bulk and retain the ability to switch moves, but Choice Scarf is another option to avoid Speed ties; this is especially important against offensive sweepers with Shell Smash, Spore, or Dark Void, as Chansey may not be able to recover from losing the Speed tie. Chansey's own moveset comes into play when it is switched in on a Pokemon behind a Substitute, with Illusion active, or that is an already-transformed Imposter user. Whirlwind forces the opposing Pokemon out, potentially disrupting a Substitute + Baton Pass user's support. Chatter allows Chansey to annoy Mold Breaker users behind a Substitute that it may try to switch into, such as Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza and Xerneas supported by a Substitute + Baton Pass user. Lunar Dance is a great option to retain momentum when Chansey is weakened, as Chansey excels on offensive teams that don't mind sacrificing Chansey to heal a severely damaged offensive teammate. Parting Shot allows Chansey to retain momentum while also weakening offensive opponents switching into Chansey. Spikes allows Chansey to set entry hazards when Chansey has a free turn; it also synergizes well with teammates running Stealth Rock. Wish takes advantage of Chansey's titanic HP to nearly fully heal teammates; alternatively, Recover is a strong option on Eviolite sets for more reliable recovery, as Chansey is prone to getting worn down by boosted threats. The given EV spread minimizes Speed so Chansey goes last in Imposter user mirrors, as having lower PP when Transformed and the opposing Imposter user's set likely being Imposter-proofed means Transforming is disadvantageous; the IVs set Chansey's Hidden Power type to Fire, as it is the most common Hidden Power type used to Imposter-proof.</p> <p>Due to its amazing utility in checking opposing sweepers, Imposter Chansey fits on nearly every team, though it excels on offense in particular. However, it requires some support to effectively scout and make progress. First, in order to switch in without risking being trapped and eliminated, Chansey requires teammates that can bring it in with a slow pivoting move such as Baton Pass Wonder Guard Mega Audino, Blissey, and Escavalier. Additionally, because Chansey's main utility activates on switch, Defog support from a teammate allows it to more easily come in and out without getting worn down by entry hazards; as such, Wonder Guard users that often carry Defog like Arceus and Primal Kyogre are good partners for Chansey. Chansey also requires a teammate that can switch into Knock Off, as it is heavily reliant on its item. Wonder Guard Pokemon that are not weak to Dark and work well on offensive teams, like Xerneas and Wonder Guard Gyarados, can easily switch into Knock Off for Chansey. Finally, -ate Speed users like Pixilate Mega Diancie and Refrigerate Kyurem-B excel at defeating sweepers that Imposter-proof themselves against Chansey like Mold Breaker Mega Gengar.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its ludicrously powerful Huge Power-boosted attacks, solid overall bulk, potential mind games with Pursuit and Sucker Punch, and ability to threaten Shell Smash Primal Groudon with STAB Water Shuriken, Mega Gyarados is arguably the best revenge killer in the format. Pursuit is its most important move, notably threatening Giratina, and it potentially traps many Mold Breaker users that Mega Gyarados can survive a hit from; it heavily damages or OHKOes Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Dialga. Trick-or-Treat is an incredible tool for Mega Gyarados, making most Wonder Guard users weak to Pursuit and Sucker Punch to often outright remove them. Alternatively, Gastro Acid threatens Wonder Guard Mega Sableye and Xerneas reliant on Leftovers for recovery due to the threat of Knock Off; Gastro Acid also is passed by Baton Pass, and it threatens frail Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers like Mega Gardevoir and Mega Lucario, removing their immunity to Water Shuriken. However, Gastro Acid sacrifices some key KOs compared to Trick-or-Treat, like against Primal Kyogre and Slaking. Spore incapacitates Primal Groudon using King's Shield and Wonder Guard or Shadow Tag switch-ins, and it is rarely blocked due to the move's targets usually forgoing Safety Goggles. Mega Gyarados can also forgo running a utility move for an all-out attacker set with both Sucker Punch and Knock Off. Knock Off is a ridiculously powerful STAB attack that OHKOes Giratina and most neutral Pokemon and it severely chips extremely bulky sweepers like Primal Groudon and Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Xerneas. Alternatively, Sucker Punch creates mind games against offensive Shadow Tag users can that survive Water Shuriken but not Sucker Punch after minimal damage, like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Rayquaza. Finally, Water Shuriken sets Mega Gyarados apart from other Huge Power Dark-types, allowing it to threaten Primal Groudon and Mold Breaker Mega Diancie; it also breaks through Focus Sash, threatening extremely frail offensive Pokemon like Deoxys-A. Lum Berry prevents status from foes Mega Gyarados wants to Pursuit trap, like Giratina and Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, while Dread Plate enables key KOs, including Giratina with Pursuit after Stealth Rock, as well as Mega Mewtwo X and Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza with Sucker Punch or Pursuit. Investment in HP optimizes Mega Gyarados's overall bulk, avoiding the 2HKO from Modest Mega Gengar's Sludge Wave.</p> <p>Mega Gyarados works best on teams that only have room for one revenge killer and have teammates that lure in threats it can Pursuit trap. Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas fairly easily lures in the most significant of said threats, Primal Groudon, making it an amazing partner. Mega Gyarados also appreciates Xerneas passing Substitutes to it, giving it more chances to threaten opposing Wonder Guard users with Trick-or-Treat or Gastro Acid, particularly if it lacks Lum Berry. Mega Gyarados threatens the largest threats to the ubiquitous core of Giratina, Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, and Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas, those being Mega Gengar and Mega Latios, though it struggles to consistently check the latter without Sucker Punch and careful play. Mega Gyarados also assists Giratina as a secondary check to Primal Groudon, as it can revenge kill Primal Groudon if Giratina is overwhelmed by disruption moves like Dark Void, Spore, and Taunt. In return, Giratina checks most Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers, which Mega Gyarados can't reliably threaten. Mega Gyarados also works well on teams with two Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, as it can threaten Wonder Guard users weak to Dark for them, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Cresselia, and Dusclops, and opposing sweepers that can force Mega Mewtwo X out, like Mega Gengar and Mold Breaker Mega Mewtwo Y. It's alsovaluable alongside Protean Mega Latios or Mega Mewtwo Y because trapping Dark-weak Wonder Guard users, like minimum Speed Cresselia, Dusclops, and Mega Mewtwo Y lacking Baton Pass, allows these teammates to forgo coverage for them in favor of other threats. As Wonder Guard Xerneas is the most common switch-in to Mega Gyarados, Pokemon that take advantage of it coming in, such as Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar with Poison-type coverage, and Dialga with Steel-type coverage, are great teammates. Because Mega Gyarados is prone to entry hazards and opposing Pursuit users wearing it down over a game, Magic Bounce users, like Giratina, Yveltal, and rarer options in Registeel, Mega Steelix, and Mega Venusaur, are good partners. Finally, because Mega Gyarados dislikes burns, defensive Wonder Guard users are great teammates, especially ones that utilize Aromatherapy well like Primal Kyogre, Slaking, and Mega Scizor, and especially if Mega Gyarados forgoes Lum Berry.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp deters physical attackers that threaten Gyarados, like Mega Mewtwo X, while also annoying Prankster Giratina, Wonder Guard users forgoing reliable recovery, and Imposter users. Psycho Shift bypasses Magic Bounce and doesn't miss, though Gyarados then cannot annoy Wonder Guard Mega Beedrill. Dark Void functions similarly to Will-O-Wisp, with the greater immediate reward of disabling a switch-in, though sleep turns are variable, and this leaves Gyarados without an option to chip down opposing Wonder Guard users. STAB Foul Play allows Gyarados to proactively threaten boosted sweepers, OHKOing Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza after a Shell Smash use, while chipping away at Giratina and threatening immediate damage on offensive checks like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Diancie. King's Shield in tandem with Will-O-Wisp protects Mega Gyarados from powerful physical threats like Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X and Choice Band Mega Rayquaza while also letting it stall for Poison Heal recovery. Recover increases Gyarados's longevity, allowing it to stomach boosted hits with less consequence and absorb passive damage from entry hazards and Curse Giratina more freely. Poison Heal in tandem with Toxic Orb allows Gyarados to reliably switch into most Mold Breaker sweepers when healthy thanks to the sleep immunity, while the passive recovery from Poison Heal is useful when accruing hazard chip damage and absorbing Giratina's Curse. The given EVs and nature allow Gyarados to survive Primal Groudon's Shell Smash-boosted Thousand Arrows while maximizing its special bulk.</p> <p>Poison Heal Mega Gyarados finds itself on bulky offensive teams that use its role as a blanket check to most Mold Breaker sweepers to free up team slots for powerful wallbreakers and sweepers. Wonder Guard Shell Smash users like Xerneas and Mega Lucario are often used with Poison Heal Gyarados, since they simultaneously check revenge killers like -ate users and pose an offensive threat. Prankster Giratina is an excellent partner due to soft-checking most Mold Breaker users in tandem with Gyarados, which cannot reliably deter sweepers that survive Foul Play after a boost, such as Quiver Dance Mega Rayquaza. Additionally, Giratina can annoy Substitute + Baton Pass Magic Bounce users with Curse and soft-check Huge Power users, which threaten Gyarados. Primal Groudon is a good partner to Will-O-Wisp variants, as it switches into Mega Gyarados's checks like Wonder Guard Xerneas and Pixilate Mega Diancie, and Shadow Tag variants of Primal Groudon can trap Mega Diancie and Wonder Guard Mega Beedrill while threatening Imposter Chansey transformed into Gyarados if it can be safely PP stalled. A revenge killer with priority moves, like Huge Power Slaking or Pixilate Mega Diancie, is useful to alleviate Gyarados's role as a setup sweeper deterrent and set entry hazards for Gyarados and its teammates to take advantage of; crucially, they threaten most Mold Breaker sweepers that OHKO Gyarados after a boost, like Xerneas and Mega Latios. Using two Wonder Guard users not weak to Sheer Cold is essential, as No Guard users with Gastro Acid and Huge Power foes are otherwise problematic. Wonder Guard Blissey in particular can assist against special Mold Breaker users, like Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza and Xerneas, though it is fodder against Substitute Mega Rayquaza without disruption moves like Chatter.</p>"

Baton Pass allows Mega Mewtwo Y to pivot easily without fearing Pursuit from Pokemon like Mega Gyarados, Mega Diancie, and the rare Mega Tyranitar while also passing a Substitute to a teammate if Substitute is being run. Gastro Acid stops many Mold Breaker users from damaging Mega Mewtwo Y and annoys many other support Pokemon, while Taunt can completely shut down many support Wonder Guard users, disrupt Substitute + Baton pass foes, and stop Mold Breaker users from using sleep or set-up setup moves. Psystrike is a strong source of damage and synergizes well with Gastro Acid's ability suppression, allowing Mega Mewtwo Y to effectively threaten many Wonder Guard users. Destiny Bond is another tool for dealing with Mold Breakers Breaker and Huge Power users, but it has to be used carefully and at the correct time, and it also leaves the team with one less Wonder Guard user. Substitute is also an option, as it synergizes extremely well with Baton Pass and can also make it easier to use Taunt on Mold Breaker users. Stealth Rock is usually used due to how many options Mega Mewtwo Y has to force switches and stop Defoggers, but Defog and Aromatherapy are also options. Lastly, Dark Void allows Mega Mewtwo Y to even more easily pass Substitutes to teammates using the free turns provided by sleep.</p> <p>Mega Mewtwo Y prefers being placed upon offense teams, as it has many options to maintain and create momentum for its teammates. Alongside this, Mold Breaker users such as Mega Latios and Mega Rayquaza can benefit a lot from Mega Mewtwo Y's Substitute passing.

      "Huge Power (Mewtwo-Mega-X)": {
        "description": "<p>Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X is one of the most well-known figures and strongest wallbreakers in the metagame. Its Huge Power-boosted attacks can tear through almost any team, and very few Pokemon can take a hit from it. However, Mega Mewtwo X still requires careful optimization with its moves. The first move is Fairy- or Dark-type to force out or cripple its best tank, Giratina. Dark-type moves also target Psychic-type Wonder Guard users such as Cresselia, Meloetta, and Mega Mewtwo Y. while Play Rough targets Mega Sableye, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Rayquaza. Gunk Shot, Poison Jab, and Gear Grind hit Fairy-types in Xerneas, Mega Audino, and Mega Gardevoir. Gunk Shot has the ability to OHKO Mega Audino, whereas Poison Jab is more accurate, and it still OHKOes Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir. Gear Grind also OHKOes all three and can break Substitute. However, there is no poison chance, and it can still miss. Drain Punch is for OHKOing Normal-types such as Arceus, Blissey, and Slaking while gaining recovery back. Sacred Fire targets Mega Beedrill, Mega Scizor, and Genesect, as well as spreading burns on the opposing team. Thousand Arrows is for all the Ground-weak Pokemon such as pure Electric-types, Primal Groudon, Drapion, and Skuntank. Unlike other Ground-type moves, it targets non-grounded Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza and Mega Manectric holding Air Balloon. Fusion Bolt and Petal Blizzard are for Water- and Flying-types such as Primal Kyogre, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Swampert. Mega Mewtwo X can make use of Water Shuriken to target Ho-Oh, Volcarona, and Primal Groudon. It can also break Substitute, as well as revenge killing a boosted Primal Groudon or Mega Tyranitar. Gastro Acid removes opposing Wonder Guard, ensuring its users are vulnerable regardless of your coverage while disrupting some key switch-ins such as Prankster Giratina. However, Gastro Acid makes Mega Mewtwo X a bit harder to always Imposter-proof, so it's rarely the first choice.136 Speed EVs are used to outspeed neutral-nature Mega Rayquaza. The remaining EVs in HP help survive some attacks, such as Choice Band Primal Groudon's Thousand Arrows, Mega Gyarados's Sucker Punch, and Extreme Speed from unboosted Regigigas. 220 Speed EVs may also be run to outpace maximum Speed, positive-nature Mega Latios or Mega Diancie. Lum Berry is nearly always run, as Will-O-Wisp, Glare, or Spore would otherwise completely dismantle Mega Mewtwo X.</p> <p>Mega Mewtwo X can run so many coverage options well, but it still only has four moveslots, so it generally wants partners that can fill in the gaps in its coverage. Usually, the best choice is another Mega Mewtwo X, running either Huge Power or Shadow Tag, with another set of four coverage moves. It is best because each Mega Mewtwo X can bluff being the other; unless the opponent can tell them apart through factors such as HP or status, they're unable to respond properly. Other Shadow Tag, Protean, or Huge Power users can also fill in Mega Mewtwo X's coverage gaps, such as Shadow Tag Lugia with Perish Song, Protean Mega Latios or Mega Mewtwo Y, and Huge Power Mega Tyranitar. Most Mega Mewtwo X teams also want at least one priority move user, like an -ate ability user such as Mega Rayquaza, Mega Diancie, Abomasnow, Kyurem-B, Shadow Tag Regigigas, or Huge Power Mega Gyarados. Typically, slower bulky Wonder Guard users such as Mega Audino, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skuntank, Blissey, and Mega Swampert are chosen to slowly pivot into Mega Mewtwo X via Parting Shot or Baton Pass usually being the main form of utility and field control for Mega Mewtwo X teams. Wonder Guard users also are the main way to Imposter-proof Mega Mewtwo X, specifically ones not weak to its coverage. Giratina with Prankster can use Spore, Curse, Destiny Bond, and/or Encore to stop sweepers, while Magic Bounce Giratina can keep entry hazards and status away, helping Mega Mewtwo X stay healthy. This support also makes two Mega Mewtwo X harder for opponents to tell apart.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X is an extremely potent trapper thanks to its amazing Attack, useful Fighting-type STAB, good Speed tier, and decent bulk. Drain Punch is an incredible STAB move that OHKOes Mega Gyarados and increases Mega Mewtwo X's longevity. Alternatively, Low Kick allows Mega Mewtwo X to hit even harder, OHKOing Wonder Guard Slaking, physically defensive Arceus, and Mega Steelix after minimal chip. Precipice Blades allows Mega Mewtwo X to OHKO standard Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock and target Wonder Guard users weak to it, like Primal Groudon, Skuntank, and Mega Manectric; Thousand Arrows is a more accurate option that also targets niche Air Balloon Wonder Guard users. Sacred Fire is an alternative coverage option that targets Wonder Guard Mega Scizor, Genesect, and Escavalier and spreads burns against checks like Giratina. Bolt Strike and Power Whip OHKO all Primal Kyogre variants; additionally, the former targets Wonder Guard Gyarados, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh, while the latter threatens Mega Swampert. Gear Grind OHKOes standard Wonder Guard Xerneas and forces Shed Shell Mega Audino out; it can also threaten a heavily damaged Xerneas behind a Substitute. Knock Off and Play Rough both threaten Mega Latios and, to an extent, Magic Bounce Giratina. Knock Off also threatens Wonder Guard Cresselia and Dusclops, while Play Rough can threaten Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza as well as most Yveltal variants. Trick is an option that disrupts most Wonder Guard users, namely Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas and defensive Wonder Guard users like Primal Kyogre, Slaking, and Mega Audino; however, Mega Mewtwo X dislikes staying in on Xerneas if it lacks Gear Grind. The given EV spread allows Mega Mewtwo X to outspeed neutral natured Mold Breaker Rayquaza, Mega Latios, and Mega Diancie while allowing Mega Mewtwo X to more easily take hits from Pokemon it traps, like Lum Berry Mega Gyarados, Choice Band Primal Groudon, and Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas. An Adamant nature with either 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe or 36 HP / 252 Atk / 220 Spe outspeeds Modest Mega Latios and Mega Diancie, and Timid Mega Latios, though the former fails to outspeed neutral natured Mega Rayquaza and the latter is OHKOed much more often by Lum Berry Mega Gyarados's Sucker Punch and Lum Berry Huge Power Slaking and Regigigas's Extreme Speed. Alternatively, a Jolly nature could be used to outspeed positive natured Mega Rayquaza, Mega Latios, and Mega Diancie, though not running an Adamant nature leaves Mega Mewtwo X more vulnerable to healthy Primal Groudon.</p> <p>Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X fits best on teams that appreciate its ability to trap and eliminate slower offensive foes, like most support Wonder Guard users lacking a Shed Shell. Giratina and Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas appreciate Mega Mewtwo X's ability to revenge kill powerful attackers that would pose a threat to them, such as Protean Mega Latios and Choice Band Beat Up Primal Groudon. In return, Giratina can check Shell Smash Mold Breaker Primal Groudon while also providing paralysis support with Glare. Xerneas can pass Substitutes to Mega Mewtwo X, provide entry hazard support, and lure in its own offensive checks for Mega Mewtwo X to remove. Huge Power Dark-types, notably Mega Gyarados, can provide support against foes that Mega Mewtwo X cannot trap and KO, such as Mega Gengar, and threaten Prankster Giratina, which is Mega Mewtwo X's most prominent check.Offensive Mold Breaker users that threaten Giratina, such as Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza, Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Gengar, and Dialga, also work well with Mega Mewtwo X. Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y, in particular, can make use of Volt Switch to bring Mega Mewtwo X in against switch-ins vulnerable to Shadow Tag; the latter can also potentially lure Mega Gyarados in for Mega Mewtwo X to trap and remove. Offensive Wonder Guard users, like Xerneas, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Lucario, and No Guard users forgoing a Choice Scarf, like Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Manectric, appreciate Mega Mewtwo X's ability to trap and remove an opposing Wonder Guard user in a wide variety of matchups. Other Shadow Tag users, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Latios, and even a second Mega Mewtwo X, are also valuable teammates, as together they can trap a wide array of opposing Wonder Guard users, paving the way for a Huge Power or No Guard teammate to sweep. Additionally, teammates that can remove foes' Shed Shells, like Trick users and Mold Breaker Knock Off users, are appreciated, as most Wonder Guard users are vulnerable to Mega Mewtwo X once their Shed Shell is removed. A priority revenge killer—such as -ate Speed Kyurem-B, Mega Abomasnow, and Mega Rayquaza—or Imposter user alongside Mega Mewtwo X forms a potent revenge killing core that threatens the vast majority of sweepers; however, teams running Mega Mewtwo X and Imposter Chansey struggle to check Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, so they appreciate defensive Pokemon like Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre, Blissey, and Mega Audino and non-Wonder Guard users like Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Defensive Wonder Guard users in general, such as Mega Scizor, Mega Beedrill, and Cresselia, also Imposter-proof Mega Mewtwo X (if it isn't running coverage that hits them) and provide Defog, Aromatherapy, and Wish support.</p>"

Choice Scarf allows Mega Mewtwo Y to outspeed every unboosted threat as well as some boosted ones, such as +2 maximum Speed Primal Groudon. Sheer Cold is the preferred OHKO move, as no Pokemon is immune to it without Wonder Guard or Sturdy. Fissure is an alternative that misses out on Mega Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh but hits the somewhat uncommon, though still relevant, group of Wonder Guard users weak to Ground—namely Primal Groudon, Mega Lucario, and Mega Manectric. Trick allows Mega Mewtwo Y to both hinder a Wonder Guard switch-in and have the flexibility of switching moves for the remainder of the game. Choice Scarf No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y's remaining two moveslots are extremely flexible, and almost any combination of the listed moves is viable. Sing, Gastro Acid, and Stealth Rock take advantage of Mega Mewtwo Y's ability to force in Wonder Guard users with Sheer Cold or Fissure, either hindering them with sleep, forcing them to switch out again, or taking advantage of the forced switch by setting Stealth Rock. Sing and Gastro Acid together allow Mega Mewtwo Y to spread sleep and generate an abundance of free turns for its teammates. Gastro Acid also pairs nicely with Stealth Rock, allowing Mega Mewtwo Y to continually force chip damage against Wonder Guard foes. Alternatively, thanks to Mega Mewtwo Y's extremely high Special Attack stat, it can effectively run coverage moves to damage or outright KO common Wonder Guard switch-ins. Zap Cannon and Inferno hit Water- and Bug / Steel type Wonder Guard users, respectively, in addition to being broadly useful against a wide-array of non-Wonder Guard threats thanks to their respective 100% chances to paralyze and burn. Additionally, Zap Cannon 2HKOes Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza, non-Assault Vest Yveltal, and Ho-Oh after minimal chip—making it particularly useful on Fissure variants of Mega Mewtwo Y. Freeze-Dry hits Water-type Wonder Guard users, Giratina, and OHKOes the most relevant Flying-type, Mega Rayquaza, making it another useful option on Fissure variants of Mega Mewtwo Y. Sludge Wave hits common Fairy-type Wonder Guard users like Xerneas, Mega Audino, and Mega Gardevoir, while Focus Blast threatens Normal-type Wonder Guard users not named Blissey or Chansey. The leftover 4 EVs should be placed in Defense to allow Mega Mewtwo Y to always survive Mega Diancie's Pursuit. Note that if Mega Mewtwo Y opts to forgo coverage attacks completely, an EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe and a Timid nature should be used.</p> <p>Most teams benefit from the revenge killing potential Choice Scarf No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y provides, in addition to forcing in passive Wonder Guard users that teammates can take advantage of. Due to Mega Mewtwo Y's frailty, slow Wonder Guard pivots, such as Xerneas and Mega Scizor, make good teammates. In particular, Substitute + Baton Pass teammates like Wonder Guard Xerneas can grant Mega Mewtwo Y security against revenge killers and Imposter users. In return, Mega Mewtwo Y provides them with free turns to create and pass Substitutes to other teammates as well. Powerful offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza appreciate No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y's ability to force in Wonder Guard users. Additionally, both Wonder Guard and Mold Breaker setup sweepers appreciate the free turns Mega Mewtwo Y generates, as well as its ability to threaten Prankster Giratina; however, Giratina can force a trade with Destiny Bond. Trick-immune Wonder Guard teammates such as Blue Orb Primal Kyogre, Plate Arceus, and Mail Cresselia are valuable teammates to Imposter-proof No Guard + Trick Mega Mewtwo Y. Shadow Tag teammates such as Mega Mewtwo X and Perish Song Lugia appreciate Mega Mewtwo Y's ability to force in Wonder Guard users and remove their Shed Shell with Trick. Wonder Guard users with Stealth Rock, Defog, and Aromatherapy are also notable teammates for Gastro Acid variants of Mega Mewtwo Y, as they help it continually force switches—and entry hazard chip damage—versus opposing Wonder Guard and Mold Breaker users alike, while also allowing Mega Mewtwo Y to switch freely without fear of entry hazard chip damage itself. Finally, -ate Speed users make excellent teammates for Choice Scarf No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y, as they can revenge kill nearly every boosted threat that Mega Mewtwo Y itself doesn’t outpace and revenge kill.</p>"

      "No Guard Wallbreaker (Mewtwo-Mega-Y)": {
        "description": "<p>With a Focus Sash or Lum Berry equipped, No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y is a potent and flexible wallbreaker. Focus Sash provides security against Imposter users, Pursuit trappers, and opposing No Guard users and allows it to safely enter the battlefield at least once without Substitute + Baton Pass or slow pivoting support. Alternatively, Lum Berry can improve Mega Mewtwo Y's ability to switch into status spreaders, such as Glare Giratina and Spore or Dark Void Mold Breaker users. Sing allows Mega Mewtwo Y to generate free turns against basically every possible switch-in. Gastro Acid forces out the Wonder Guard users that switch in and, on Fissure variants, allows Mega Mewtwo Y to more effectively force mind games against teams using one or more Ground-weak Wonder Guard users. Stealth Rock gives Mega Mewtwo Y an efficient way to make progress in nearly every game and synergizes exceptionally well with its inherent ability to force switches. Zap Cannon and Inferno are great coverage options that hit Water- and Bug / Steel type Wonder Guard users, respectively, and are also useful against a broad range of non-Wonder Guard switch-ins thanks to their secondary effects. Freeze-Dry is another option to hit Water-type Wonder Guard users and also OHKOes the most prominent Flying-type in the format, Mega Rayquaza, making it particularly useful on Fissure variants. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-type Wonder Guard users; Focus Blast hits Normal-type Wonder Guard users. The choice between these options is flexible and many variations on the options presented in Mega Mewtwo Y’s latter three moveslots are viable and should be chosen based on individual team-building needs. Note that if Mega Mewtwo Y is not running any coverage attacks, an EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe and a Timid nature should be used.</p> <p>Most teams benefit from the free turns No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y generates. In particular, powerful Mold Breaker users like Choice Band Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza appreciate Mega Mewtwo Y's ability to force in Wonder Guard users. Substitute + Baton Pass users, like Wonder Guard Xerneas, also make excellent teammates, as they're able to utilize the free turns Mega Mewtwo Y generates to pass Substitutes. Offensive Shell Smash Wonder Guard users such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Lucario also appreciate the opportunities to set up that Mega Mewtwo Y can create. Additionally, they're also very resistant to the revenge killers, like -ate Speed users and Huge Power Mega Gyarados, that force Mega Mewtwo Y out. They can also efficiently Imposter-proof Mega Mewtwo Y on offensive teams that require the role compression. Focus Sash + No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y also appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Glare + Prankster Giratina, Glare + Wonder Guard Xerneas, and Glare Support Wonder Guard users, to outpace and OHKO as many foes as possible. Shadow Tag users make excellent teammates for Mega Mewtwo Y, as they can trap and remove Wonder Guard users that frequently forgo Shed Shell—such as Xerneas and Mega Lucario—making it much easier for Mega Mewtwo Y to clean teams with Sheer Cold or Fissure. Defensive Wonder Guard users are valuable teammates, as they can clear the field of entry hazards, cure Mega Mewtwo Y of status, and provide it with slow pivoting and Imposter-proofing support. Defog support, as well as Magic Bounce support from Pokemon like Giratina, is particularly critical for Focus Sash variants of Mega Mewtwo to preserve the utility of its item. Finally, Fake Out + Extreme Speed users such as Aerilate Mega Rayquaza and Huge Power Regigigas can form a potent revenge killing core alongside Mega Mewtwo Y.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to its titanic HP stat, Blissey is a powerful Imposter user; however, Chansey's ability to bluff Eviolite nearly always make it superior. It's worth noting, though, that Blissey's viability as an Imposter user does force opponents to play with that possibility in mind if they see Blissey in team preview, regardless of whether it is an Imposter set or not. An alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with either a Bold or a Calm nature gives Blissey better mixed bulk and is a decent option on King's Shield sets. Additionally, physically defensive EV spreads improve Blissey's matchup versus the rare Mold Breaker Pursuit. Transform is a niche scouting tool that, like Imposter, takes advantage of Blissey's very high HP. Glare, Nuzzle, Will-O-Wisp, Chatter, Perish Song, and Magic Coat are all alternative viable utility options. However, Blissey usually prefers Knock Off or Whirlwind to help it check and Imposter-proof special Mold Breaker users. Foul Play is an option that OHKOes Mega Gengar and Mega Latios after a Shell Smash and 2HKOes Mega Diancie and Mega Sceptile after a Shell Smash and Knock Off. However, its utility is limited outside of those targets, as Blissey can seldom take a hit from a boosted physical attacker. Trick is an option that allows Blissey to disrupt opposing Wonder Guard users, as well as Imposter-proof Trick + Choice Specs Mold Breaker teammates without the use of Mail. Parting Shot is an alternative to Baton Pass that inflicts a useful debuff while pivoting, but also cedes momentum to Magic Bounce users. Sticky Web, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes are alternatives to Stealth Rock if their individual advantages are desired. Finally, Blissey's extremely high HP makes it one of the most viable users of niche options Metal Burst, Mirror Coat, and Counter.</p> <p>Safety Goggles is an option to improve Blissey’s ability to check Spore Mold Breaker users. Mail is an option make Blissey immune to Trick, which can be useful for Imposter-proofing Choice Specs + Trick Mold Breaker teammates. Leftovers is an option that allows Blissey to use Recover less frequently versus special Mold Breaker users, potentially maintaining momentum. However, all of these options come at the cost of increased vulnerability to Shadow Tag users—which is one of the main advantages that Blissey has over Wonder Guard Eviolite Chansey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Blissey’s physical fragility means even unboosted physical Mold Breaker users force it out. Additionally, Special Mold Breaker users carrying either Secret Sword or Psystrike similarly force Blissey out.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Similar to moves from Mold Breaker users, Fighting coverage pierces Blissey’s Wonder Guard. And since Secret Sword hits Blissey’s weaker Defense stat, essentially every Huge Power, Protean, Parental Bond, and Wonder Guard + Shell Smash user carrying Fighting coverage will force Blissey out. A healthy Blissey can withstand hits from uncommon Aura Sphere foes, however.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick users can hinder all but rare Mail variants of Blissey for the entirety of the game, either with Black Sludge forcing it to Recover more frequently or Choice Scarf forcing it to relinquish momentum. Trick also removes Shed Shell, leaving Blissey vulnerable to Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo X.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Prankster Giratina dislikes losing its item to Knock Off variants of Blissey, but is otherwise unthreatened by Blissey and can force it out with Encore, Curse, or chip it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt leaves most Blissey sets lacking Knock Off unable to support or maintain momentum for their team.</p>",

      "Wonder Guard Support": {
        "description": "<p>Unparalleled special bulk, an advantageously low Speed tier, and only one weakness make Blissey a highly effective support Wonder Guard Pokemon. Nearly unique among Wonder Guard users, Blissey's incredible Special Defense allows it to both Imposter-proof a variety of powerful special Mold Breaker teammates and to check opposing special Mold Breaker foes. Baton Pass takes advantage of Blissey's low Speed, notably underspeeding other common slow pivots like Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Scizor. King's Shield is an alternative that allows Blissey to utilize Wish more effectively and scout foes; an EV Spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature should be used on sets with King's Shield, as otherwise Blissey is OHKOed even by many -2 physical attackers. Defog and Aromatherapy are appreciated by nearly all Pure Hackmons team structures; however, if a teammate is carrying either one, Blissey can opt for other utility moves such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Whirlwind. Knock Off and Whirlwind, in particular, are useful options, as they allow Blissey to more effectively check and Imposter-proof many powerful special Mold Breaker users. Knock Off deprives Plate + Judgment users like Mega Diancie, Dialga, and Mega Gengar lacking Secret Sword of their STAB move, while Whirlwind can force out special Mold Breaker users that require multiple boosts to break through Blissey. Additionally, Knock Off can helpfully deprive non-Wonder Guard foes, as well as most Psychic- and Ghost- type Wonder Guard foes, of their Shed Shells, Safety Goggles, and other critical items. On some teams, this utility is so valuable that Blissey can forgo Baton Pass or King’s Shield to be able to make use of three utility moveslots. Finally, recovery is essential for Blissey to function effectively. Recover's immediacy and reliability is generally preferred, but Wish takes advantage of Blissey's titanic HP stat to support its teammates and synergizes well with King's Shield and Baton Pass. Shed Shell is the preferred item to improve Blissey's matchup against Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo X and Perish Song Lugia. A specially defensive EV spread is preferred on sets without King's Shield to minimize damage from powerful special Mold Breaker users, as well as uncommon Aura Sphere variants of Protean users like Mega Latios and Shell Smash + Wonder Guard sweepers like Mega Gardevoir. Additionally, a specially defensive EV spread allows Blissey to survive Mega Lucario’s +2 Fist Plate Judgment after Stealth Rock and force it out with Whirlwind.</p> <p>Blissey fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check special attackers without Secret Sword and Psystrike. Additionally, powerful special Mold Break sweeprs, such as Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y lacking Psystrike and Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza, appreciate Blissey's ability to efficiently Imposter-proof them. Furthermore, Blissey is a particularly good teammate for special Shell Smash + Mold Breaker teammates that aren't making use of a Plate for Imposter-proofing, such as Mega Latios without Psystrike and Moonblast Mega Diancie, which are otherwise very difficult to Imposter-proof. Blissey's vulnerability to physical attackers means it appreciates teammates such as physically defensive Wonder Guard users like Mega Scizor and Cresselia, as well as Prankster Giratina. Furthermore, Blissey and Giratina have great overall synergy; Blissey can tank powerful special Fairy- and Ghost-type attacks from the likes of Mega Diancie and Mega Gengar for Giratina, while Giratina can switch into Fighting-type attacks and powerful physical Mold Breaker foes for Blissey. Notably, the combination of Wonder Guard Blissey and Prankster Giratina can make progress extremely difficult to make for teams that rely on Mold Breaker Arceus. On bulkier balance teams, Blissey can be used alongside another defensive Wonder Guard user—granting them both additional flexibility with their movesets and, in particular, allowing Blissey to more easily use utility options like Knock Off and Whirlwind. Blissey also appreciates Magic Bounce teammates for their ability reflect entry hazards, as Blissey prefers to take as little chip damage as possible to more effectively check special Mold Breaker foes. Finally, Pursuit users like Huge Power Mega Gyarados are excellent teammates for their ability to trap and threaten Giratina, one of Blissey’s most common switch-ins. Mega Gyarados, in particular, is an excellent teammate for the additional utility of being able to revenge kill Primal Groudon. Similarly, revenge killers like Refrigerate Kyurem-B and Pixilate Mega Diancie are notable teammates for their ability to force out Mega Gengar and Mega Latios, some of the most common users of Secret Sword and Psystrike, respectively.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mold Breaker Mega Tyranitar can use alternative items like Dread Plate and Expert Belt to boost its Beat Up and Knock Off against Dark-type weak foes like Cresselia, Giratina, and Mega Metagross. Safety Goggles can be used in conjunction with Spore to let Mega Tyranitar Imposter-proof itself and surprise Spore Prankster Giratina; however, Safety Goggles is not as valuable as self Imposter-proofing if Mega Tyranitar is boosted or opts for Dark Void. Choice Band Mold Breaker sets without Shell Smash can be used for immediate power in exchange for the ability to set up, but this makes Mega Tyranitar struggle with faster sweepers more due to it being quite slow. Shed Shell can be used to escape from Shadow Tag users like Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X. King's Shield can be used in the fourth moveslot to debilitate revenge killers like Primal Groudon, and -ate users like Diancie-Mega, but it doesn't provide as many opportunities to set up and can be predicted by opposing revenge killers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Priority Moves</strong>: Pixilate users such as Xerneas and Mega Diancie can threaten to OHKO Mega Tyranitar with their super effective attacks, but Tyranitar can comfortably switch out against them due to its Pursuit resistance, and they cannot OHKO Mold Breaker Tyranitar if they are weakened by King's Shield. Additionally, Huge Power Mach Punch Mega Mewtwo X and Water Shuriken Mega Gyarados threaten Tyranitar, though they cannot switch into it more than once or twice.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Despite Mega Tyranitar's decent bulk, it has a lot of common weaknesses, so Pokemon that run a lot of coverage moves, like Mega Rayquaza, Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Protean Mega Latios, can threaten an unboosted Mega Tyranitar if it forgoes Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Choice Scarf Shadow Tag users like Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X can trap Mega Tyranitar and 2HKO it with Thousand Arrows and OHKO it with Low Kick, respectively. However, unbosted Mega Tyranitar 3HKOes Primal Groudon and 2HKOes Mega Mewtwo X, limiting their ability to switch in, and some Mega Tyranitar variants outspeed Primal Groudon after Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Mega Tyranitar doesn't use Lum Berry or Safety Goggles, it is very susceptible to status, particularly from the likes of Prankster Giratina, which can force Mega Tyranitar out with priority status.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Mold Breaker Mega Tyranitar is very difficult to Imposter-proof, so Imposter Chansey and Blissey discourage it from trying to set up. Additionally, Huge Power Mega Tyranitar dislikes being chipped repeatedly by Pursuit from opposing Imposter users.</p> <p><strong>Non Dark-weak Wonder Guard Users</strong>: Wonder Guard users that aren't weak to Dark such as Slaking, Arceus, and Primal Kyogre can switch into Huge Power Tyranitar; however, they must fear Mold Breaker sets, Gastro Acid, and Trick-or-Treat sets.</p>",

      "Shell Smash Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Tyranitar is a very powerful Shell Smash sweeper, due to its high attack stat, resistance to Pursuit, and decent bulk, threatening Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza, unboosted Mold Breaker Mega Latios, and Giratina. It also takes resisted hits from revenge killers like Regigigas, Slaking, and Gale Wings and Aerilate Mega Rayquaza. Beat Up can be used to hit or KO foes through Substitute and Focus Sash, threatening common users like Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A while also being the strongest Dark-type STAB move available with five healthy teammates. Knock Off is an alternative, powerful STAB attack, and its item removal is useful team support as well as a way to facilitate progress, removing opposing Safety Goggles if Mega Tyranitar opts for Spore. Diamond Storm helps maintain Mega Tyranitar's defensive profile by cancelling the Defense drops from Shell Smash, making it harder for physical attackers to revenge kill it. Spore and Dark Void can be used for gaining free turns so that Mega Tyranitar can set up. Taunt is used to shut down would-be checks in Mega Audino and Prankster Giratina, gaining setup turns in a similar fashion. Leftovers provides Mega Tyranitar longevity to capitalize on its defensive utility. Lum Berry is an alternative to absorb Spore, Will-O-Wisp, or Glare from Prankster Giratina or a foe Mega Tyranitar defensively checks, like setup Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza, one time. Mold Breaker lets Mega Tyranitar ignore problematic abilities like Wonder Guard and Magic Bounce, allowing it to set up in front of users of them. The first EV spread allows Mega Tyranitar to outspeed faster Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Deoxys-A after using Shell Smash, with the remaining EVs put into Attack and HP. An alternative spread of 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe allows +2 Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Choice Scarf Primal Groudon, though this does come with a slight reduction in bulk.</p> <p>Mega Tyranitar best fits on bulky balance archetypes, thanks to its ability to repeatedly come in on threats like Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza and non-Secret Sword Mega Gengar and its ability to threaten common defensive Pokemon like Giratina. Additionally, teams that struggle with revenge killers like Regigigas, Slaking, and Aerilate or Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza appreciate Mega Tyranitar's resistance to their attacks. Prankster Giratina comes in on all Primal Groudon variants while appreciating Mega Tyranitar's ability to soft check Mega Rayquaza, Mega Latios, and some Mega Gengar sets. Magic Bounce Giratina can soft check Choice item Shadow Tag users, soft check Wonder Guard users, and come in on No Guard or Huge Power foes. Mold Breaker Primal Groudon takes care of most Wonder Guard Xerneas while appreciating Mega Tyranitar checking Giratina, Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Latios. Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo X and Primal Groudon can eliminate or severely hinder Mega Tyranitar's checks; the former deals with weakened Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and Imposter users Transformed into Tyranitar, while the latter can trap opposing Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, as well as use Trick on and set entry hazards against Wonder Guard Mega Audino. Prankster Mega Metagross can pass boosts and Substitutes to Mega Tyranitar while coming in on most Mega Diancie. Although Mega Tyranitar resists attacks from most revenge killers, Shadow Tag Primal Groudon, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Diancie threaten it with their super effective moves. Therefore, Wonder Guard users not weak to their attacks, like Mega Scizor, Slaking, and Xerneas, are appreciated. Additionally, support Wonder Guard Pokemon have numerous capabilities that help Mega Tyranitar, like clearing entry hazards, curing status, and passing Shell Smash boosts and Substitutes with Baton Pass.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wonder Guard Slaking has several other options; for example, Magic Coat can be used in either of the last two moveslots, reflecting status moves such as Spore, Dark Void, Glare, Encore, Taunt, and entry hazards aimed at Slaking. Stealth Rock is an alternative to Spikes, trading the possibility of multiple layers of hazards for the ability to pressure Flying-types. Lum Berry can be used over Safety Goggles to cure sleep from Dark Void, but its one-time use stipulation makes it an inferior option. U-turn is a more uncommon pivot move that is importantly ineffective into opposing Wonder Guard users but heavily chips offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Mewtwo Y and is not stopped by Taunt. Knock Off annoys Giratina for a teammate, removing its Safety Goggles and making it vulnerable to Spore, and usually allows Slaking to beat non-Sludge Wave variants of Mega Gengar if healthy. However, Giratina having its item removed means Huge Power Mega Gyarados's Knock Off will not OHKO it. A set of Fake Out + Extreme Speed can be used in tandem with the alternate spread 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD and an Adamant nature to compress the roles of Wonder Guard and revenge killer into one teamslot if it is desperately needed, but this loses out on pivot and cleric capabilities as a result.</p> <p>Shadow Tag Slaking can run coverage moves to target different Wonder Guard users, like Gunk Shot for Xerneas and Mega Audino; Sacred Fire for Mega Scizor; Thousand Arrows for Mega Manectric, Skuntank, and Drapion; and Bolt Strike for Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Primal Kyogre, and Gyaradosite Gyarados. Water Shuriken is an option for revenge killing Mold Breaker Primal Groudon in particular, but it requires five hits to OHKO after Shell Smash and has very limited uses outside of this. Perish Song, Spore, and Stealth Rock can be used over Spikes if the team already has a Spikes user. One may choose to run three or more Slaking, as this greatly enhances the unpredictability factor for the opponent, with the Slaking running abilities like Wonder Guard, Huge Power, Prankster, Prankster, and Imposter.</p> <p>Slaking can also run a fringe Mold Breaker + Belly Drum set with Extreme Speed, one of Ice Shard or Shadow Sneak; one of King's Shield, Taunt, or Dark Void; and one of Lum Berry, Mental Herb, or Sitrus Berry, but it is inconsistent due to getting the initial Belly Drum off being difficult and Pixilate Mega Diancie reliably revenge killing chipped Slaking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Powerful Fighting-type coverage from Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Latios, and Mega Mewtwo Y exploits Slaking's one weakness and threatens it with huge damage or an OHKO. King's Shield variants of Slaking somewhat offset this vulnerability, allowing it to relatively safely scout for an unfavorable matchup.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Wonder Guard Slaking is vulnerable to being trapped by Shadow Tag users and eliminated with powerful Fighting-type coverage or Perish Song if it doesn't have a Shed Shell. Shadow Tag Slaking is similarly trapped by opposing Arena Trap users, but its lack of passivity can give it a favorable matchup against these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Powerful Mold Breaker users, especially special attacking ones, take advantage of their ability to bypass Wonder Guard and Slaking's relative passivity to scare it out and potentially set up a Shell Smash, even if Whirlwind dissuades the latter. Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza can threaten Slaking with Oblivion Wing, and Mega Gengar is immune to Slaking's Fake Out and Extreme Speed and can threaten it with a boosted Secret Sword or Psystrike, though Mega Gengar has to watch out for potential coverage variants.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users completely shut down Wonder Guard Slaking, forcing it to switch lest it use Struggle. Fast Taunt users, in particular Wonder Guard Mega Beedrill, can prevent Slaking from setting Spikes, hindering its function.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users</strong>: Wonder Guard Slaking is crippled if it is given a Choice item from Trick, locking it into one move—forcing it to either use a pivot move or give up momentum—and negating the benefits of Shed Shell or Safety Goggles. Shadow Tag Slaking also dislikes Trick due to losing the ability to use Fake Out into Extreme Speed when revenge killing foes and Encore into Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Dark Void</strong>: Wonder Guard Slaking typically cannot avoid being put to sleep by Dark Void, meaning its teammates won't receive its valuable support until it wakes up. This can be somewhat mitigated by Magic Coat, however.</p> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: Giratina forces Wonder Guard Slaking to switch out by threatening to status it and pressuring it with Curse and Encore, with Magic Bounce variants also turning Parting Shot against it.</p> <p><strong>Other Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are unable to be trapped and are immune to Fake Out and Extreme Speed. A Ghost-type other than Giratina may also not be necessary, due to Prankster Giratina being a great pick for most teams.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Shadow Tag Slaking is unable to use Encore or Spikes against Magic Bounce foes, and the most common Magic Bounce users are immune to Extreme Speed.</p>",

Parting Shot and Baton Pass allow Slaking to generate momentum for its team; the former lowers the foe's offenses but is exploitable by Magic Bounce users, and the latter possesses greater PP but passes undesirable effects like Curse, Perish Song, and Gastro Acid to its teammates. Recover provides Slaking with instant recovery, while Wish makes use of Slaking's high HP stat to keep both itself and its teammates healthy at the cost of often sacrificing momentum when used. Defog is a valuable support option that minimizes the chip damage Slaking and its teammates take throughout the game by removing entry hazards; alternatively, Stealth Rock is a valid option if the role of Defogger is already filled. Similarly, many teams appreciate Aromatherapy's ability to cure bothersome status conditions, but King's Shield and Whirlwind can be used if a teammate is already carrying it. King's Shield safely scouts for Fighting-type coverage and lets Slaking safely heal via Wish, while Whirlwind thwarts Substitute passing and setup attempts. Slaking uses a Relaxed nature minimum Speed IVs to increase the chances it moves last, allowing it to safely bring in a teammate via Parting Shot or Baton Pass. Shed Shell lets Slaking escape from Shadow Tag users such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Latios, and Mega Mewtwo Y, whereas Safety Goggles provides an immunity to Spore from Pokemon like Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Mega Gengar.</p> <p>Like other support Wonder Guard users, Slaking is mainly used on balance and bulky offense teams where a multitude of Pokemon enjoy the utility it provides. Offensive Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Mega Gengar, and Mega Latios benefit from Slaking's pivoting capabilities, which ensure they safely enter the field, as well as its ability to check Fake Out + Extreme Speed users, such as Regigias and Mega Diancie, and faster No Guard Pokemon, like Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Lopunny, and Deoxys-S. Slaking also supports bulkier offensive teammates like Primal Groudon and Dialga, healing them with Wish, which allows them to be threatening throughout the course of a game and reduces their chances of being revenge killed. Slaking is capable of Imposter-proofing Huge Power or Protean Pokemon, such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Latios, and Mega Mewtwo Y, lacking Fighting-type coverage. Due to Slaking's ability to compress the roles of a defensive pivot, entry hazard removal, and cleric into one teamslot, it can afford be run alongside offensive Shell Smash Wonder Guard users, such as Xerneas, Deoxys-A, and Mega Mewtwo Y. Alternatively, Slaking can be paired with a more passive second Wonder Guard user, such as Primal Kyogre or Mega Audino, to free up moveslots it would otherwise always dedicate to Defog and Aromatherapy. Slaking also supports Substitute + Baton Pass users lacking recovery like Wonder Guard Xerneas by healing them with Wish. Prankster Giratina can take on strong Fighting-type attacks from Mega Mewtwo X and cripple it with a status condition, aid Slaking in dealing with Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, and absorb attempts to use Trick on Slaking if Giratina is holding a Griseous Orb. Choice Scarf Shadow Tag Primal Groudon could be considered for its ability to trap faster offensive Pokemon that threaten Slaking as well as Taunt Mega Beedrill. Mega Gyarados is a potent potential partner, as it threatens Giratina—one of Slaking's most common switch-ins—with Pursuit, and it also has the potential to revenge kill dangerous Shell Smash Mold Breaker Pokemon such as Primal Groudon. Pixilate Mega Diancie particularly excels in checking Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza for Slaking and can similarly terrorize a multitude of Shell Smash users like opposing Mega Diancie and Mega Gengar.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Shadow Tag Slaking performs a similar role to Shadow Tag Regigigas and differentiates itself with its higher physical bulk, which allows it to survive hits like Huge Power Mega Gyarados's Knock Off and boosted Mold Breaker Primal Groudon's Thousand Arrows. Fake Out and Extreme Speed are crucial due to the former chipping foes with no drawback and the latter finishing off weakened foes, especially if their Defense is lowered from using Shell Smash. Slaking values coverage to hit physical threats, in particular Huge Power Mega Gyarados, more than Regigigas does, as it can take a hit more easily. Low Kick has a good chance to 2HKO Wonder Guard Slaking after Stealth Rock and Arceus from full, and it KOes Mega Gyarados after a Silk Scarf-boosted Fake Out. Encore allows Slaking to lock slower Wonder Guard users into a move, in particular Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas, which seldom runs Shed Shell or invests in Speed. Alternatively, Taunt disrupts passive Wonder Guard users that are otherwise safe switch-ins to Slaking, like Mega Audino and Primal Kyogre. Spikes capitalizes on passive foes, especially if Slaking opts for Encore or Taunt, as locking the foe into a useless move and denying hazard removal and utility allows Slaking to set up multiple Spikes layers unobstructed. Silk Scarf boosts Fake Out's and Extreme Speed's damage, allowing Slaking to revenge kill foes like weakened Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, uninvested Mega Latios, and boosted Mold Breaker Xerneas lacking King's Shield, while Leftovers increases Slaking's longevity by allowing it to recover health when using Fake Out and on turns where the foe is locked into a move via Encore. The given EV spread allows Slaking to hit as hard as possible while maximizing its physical bulk, which is crucial for letting it live both Lum Berry and Dread Plate Huge Power Mega Gyarados's Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Slaking functions well on teams that appreciate its ability to both revenge kill frailer foes and set Spikes, that can also compensate for its inability to threaten Mega Gengar. Huge Power Mega Gyarados is a great partner, as it can weaken sweepers running King's Shield for Slaking if needed, has a hard time fitting entry hazards so appreciates Slaking's ability to do so, and can switch into and threaten most special Mold Breaker users, including Mega Gengar and Mega Latios. Mega Gyarados also threatens Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, which is too bulky for most Slaking sets to threaten if healthy. Magic Bounce Giratina can Imposter-proof all sets with ease, though it is hard to fit on teams due to Prankster Giratina being difficult to forgo. A support Wonder Guard user not weak to coverage Slaking is running, such as Mega Audino, Primal Kyogre, or Mega Swampert, is essential, as while it must be wary of Encore and Taunt, it can run Defog to remove Spikes set by opposing Imposter users Transformed into Slaking. Prankster Giratina is good setup deterrence and can annoy Imposter users Transformed into Slaking with Spore, Will-O-Wisp, Glare, and Curse. A robust offensive presence is integral; two Mold Breaker users is ideal, as two Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X are hard to fit, though a single Mold Breaker is also workable if two cannot be fit onto a team.</p>"

Other pivoting moves can be run over Baton Pass, and other recovery moves can be run instead of Pain Split. Mega Sableye can use other support moves as well, such as entry hazards, Aromatherapy, and Defog. Magic Coat may be used to protect from Taunts and Encores.

More generally, ability suppression at least forces Mega Sableye to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf + Trick and Encore</strong>: Being forced into one move with Choice Scarf neutralizes Mega Sableye for the rest of the match; it relies on being able to use all of its moves to threaten foes. Similarly, Encore forces it to switch.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Even though Curse bypasses opposing Substitutes, Mega Sableye cannot gain recovery from Pain Split if the foe is behind one.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard Users</strong>: Magic Guard users like Ho-Oh do not fear any of Mega Sableye's moves.</p>",

      "Level 2 Mega Sableye": {
        "description": "<p>Not much likes switching into level 2 Mega Sableye, because it can take huge chunks out of foes's health with Curse and Pain Split. Wonder Guard shields it from most attacks: otherwise, basically every attack would OHKO it. It is at level 2 with 76 HP EVs to hit an HP stat of 15, which minimizes burn damage as a percentage of maximum HP. With Wonder Guard and one weakness, its defenses rarely matter anyway, so reducing the effect of burn on its health matters more than reducing attack damage. Its low HP stat also synergizes well with Pain Split, letting it completely heal and effectively halve the foe's remaining HP. Curse + Pain Split means passive Wonder Guard users cannot outstall Mega Sableye, as they will lose more than 50% of their maximum HP every turn, so even if they always recover, they will eventually faint. Psycho Shift is used for its 100% accuracy and ability to bypass Magic Bounce, and with burns from Flame Orb, it cripples some of the most popular Pokemon in the tier like Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Gyarados, and Giratina. Mega Sableye uses Baton Pass over Parting Shot to capitalize on the switches it forces without worrying about Magic Bounce users stealing momentum. It can run Substitute to block a hit from a Mold Breaker user or a Fairy-type attack, and Substitute also synergizes well with Baton Pass.</p> <p>Level 2 Mega Sableye fits best on bulky offense teams, which cover for its lack of defensive utility outside of Wonder Guard while capitalizing on the pressure it puts on opposing teams. Blissey and Giratina are notable teammates for checking a large swath of Mold Breaker users, and Shadow Tag Primal Groudon can trap and eliminate the most common Taunt user in Mega Beedrill. Mold Breaker Primal Groudon with Pursuit can be used to Imposter-proof Mega Sableye effectively. Substitute Mega Rayquaza works well with Mega Sableye, since Mega Rayquaza's checks are usually passive, which Sableye preys upon. A Substitute-passing teammate can be valuable to protect Mega Sableye from Mold Breaker or Fairy-type attacks once, allowing it more freedom to mess with the opponent's team.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to its high Speed and notoriety as a Wonder Guard user, Mega Manectric can effectively make use of No Guard alongside Sheer Cold or Fissure, Zap Cannon, and some combination of Inferno, Gastro Acid, Stealth Rock, and Sing. Additionally, although it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, a support Wonder Guard set with Defog and Aromatherapy is also a viable option for Mega Manectric. Mental Herb and Lum Berry are alternate item options that can allow Manectric to Baton Pass a Substitute versus Encore and sleep-inflicting opponents, respectively. Air Balloon is a fringe option that alleviates Mega Manectric’s weakness to Fissure. Finally, Manectite grants Mega Manectric an immunity to Trick. However, all of these item options are almost never worth giving up the utility Leftovers or Shed Shell provide.</p> <p>Glare is a useful option to hinder opposing sweepers and, unlike many Glare users, Mega Manectric can use it without fear of a Magic Bounce switch-in thanks to its Electric typing. Dark Void is another disruption option, though unlike Glare, a timely Magic Bounce switch-in can turn Mega Manectric into a sleeping momentum sink. Nuzzle is another alternative to Glare that affects Magic Bounce users, but has a worse matchup versus most Wonder Guard users. Destiny Bond is an option that takes advantage of Mega Manectric's high Speed stat and frailty to take a surprise KO against attackers like Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X and slower Choice item Mold Breaker users. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are options, though Mega Manectric is a noticeably less effective entry hazard setter as compared to other Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users like Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir due to its inability to force out common Magic Bounce users like Giratina. Magic Coat can be used to reflect entry hazards, sleep moves from Mold Breaker users, and Sing, Gastro Acid, Taunt, and Spider Web from No Guard users. Finally, Sheer Cold can be used to bluff No Guard sets and deter Prankster Giratina from switching in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Mega Manectric's frailty means its vulnerable to being OHKOed by Ground-type coverage from foes such as Thousand Arrows Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, Earth Power Protean Mega Latios, and Earth Power Wonder Guard Mega Gardevoir. Additionally, Mega Manectric is vulnerable to the somewhat uncommon, but very dangerous, Fissure. However, niche Destiny Bond Mega Manectric variants are often able to force a trade in a bad matchup.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Despite usually carrying Water coverage, Mega Manectric is extremely vulnerable to Primal Groudon's powerful Ground attacks. In particular, Choice Scarf + Shadow Tag Primal Groudon sets can trap, outpace, and OHKO Mega Manectric with Thousand Arrows if it isn't already behind a Substitute. Additionally, Choice Scarf + Mold Breaker Primal Groudon can also surprise KO Mega Manectric in a one-on-one scenario.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Prankster Giratina is entirely unthreatened by any Mega Manectric not carrying Taunt and can force it out with Encore or Curse. Furthermore, Giratina's Will-O-Wisp can limit Mega Manectric's ability to create Substitutes over the course of a game.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick users can hinder Mega Manectric for the entirety of the game, either with Black Sludge limiting its ability to create Substitutes or Choice items forcing it to relinquish momentum.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Despite usually carrying Scald, Taunt still leaves Mega Manectric unable to support or maintain momentum for its team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>High Speed, an immunity to paralysis, and a good typing make Wonder Guard Mega Manectric a highly effective Substitute + Baton Pass user. The combination of Substitute and Baton Pass allows Mega Manectric to support its teammates by giving them a safe turn to set up, use a utility move, or fire off a powerful attack. Scald has a high chance to OHKO standard Primal Groudon, guaranteed after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Steam Eruption always OHKOes Primal Groudon and also OHKOes standard Mold Breaker Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock, but has much lower PP and imperfect accuracy. Gastro Acid is extremely useful thanks to Mega Manectric's high Speed tier, neutralizing slower Mold Breaker users that don't carry a Ground move, such as Mega Rayquaza without Precipice Blades, Mega Latios, and Arceus. Taunt is an alternative that allows Mega Manectric to force out Prankster Giratina and support Wonder Guard users trying to phaze Manectric with Whirlwind. Leftovers keeps Mega Manectric healthy and allows it to make more Substitutes over the course of a game. If greater resilience against Shadow Tag users like Choice Scarf Primal Groudon and Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y is desired, Shed Shell can be used alongside Recover in the final moveslot. However, Substitute + Baton Pass Mega Manectric appreciates the passive recovery Leftovers provides and dislikes the loss of momentum from taking a turn to use Recover.</p> <p>Wonder Guard Mega Manectric's Ground weakness—and thus, Fissure weakness—means it should nearly always be paired with both a Wonder Guard teammate that isn't weak to Ground—such as Mega Audino or Primal Kyogre—as well as a Flying-type teammate—such as Mega Rayquaza or Yveltal. Choice Band and Choice Specs variants of Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza are particularly notable teammates, as they appreciate Mega Manectric's Substitutes in addition to being useful teammates versus Fissure users. Mega Manectric also appreciates teammates like Prankster Giratina and—though they're difficult to accommodate on most team structures—physically defensive Poison Heal users like Mega Slowbro and Mega Gyarados for their ability to defensively check Mold Breaker Primal Groudon. Similarly, Mega Manectric appreciates teammates like Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Refrigerate Mega Abomasnow, and Imposter Chansey for their ability to revenge kill Primal Groudon. Pursuit trappers like Mega Gyarados and Yveltal also double as checks to Prankster Giratina. Mold Breaker Primal Groudon itself also makes an excellent teammate, as it appreciates the opportunities Mega Manectric's Substitutes give it to either setup a Shell Smash or fire off a Choice Band boosted V-Create. Most Shell Smash Mold Breaker sweepers—especially frail ones like Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie— similarly appreciate Manectric's Substitutes to ease their setup and defend them against revenge killers like -ate Speed users and Choice Scarf Imposter users. No Guard users such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Lopunny synergize with Mega Manectric, as they give it abundant opportunities to use Substitute thanks to the pressure their OHKO moves exert. Symbiotically, No Guard users appreciate Mega Manectric's Substitutes themselves, as they grant No Guard users a free turn to disrupt the opposing team with Gastro Acid or Sing and ease their matchup against -ate Speed users and Pursuit trappers.</p>"

Mega Metagross can also run a moveset of Spore / Taunt / Substitute / Baton Pass to more easily pass Substitute against the majority of teams, though running this instead of the standard moveset means Metagross can't pass boosts, and it leaves it vulnerable to Beat Up Mega Gyarados and Mega Mewtwo X, both of which commonly run Lum Berry. Alternative boosting moves, like Shell Smash and Cotton Guard, are usable, but they don't synergize as well with Dark Void or Taunt, and non-Coil and Minimize Mega Metagross is largely outclassed by Baton Pass Wonder Guard users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce or Magic Coat Users</strong>: Magic Bounce users can come in on Mega Metagross and bounce Dark Void or Taunt back if either move was used that turn. Magic Bounce Ghost-types like Giratina can use Curse to passively chip Mega Metagross and any Baton Pass recipient as well; however, they are easily pressured by offensive teammates. Similarly, Wonder Guard users like Mega Audino, Slaking, and Mega Scizor can sometimes carry Magic Coat, which reflects Mega Metagross's Dark Void and Taunt. However, Magic Coat on Wonder Guard users is rather hard to fit, and they can only handle Mega Metagross in the long-term with Magic Coat in addition to Chatter or Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Imposter</strong>: Imposter Chansey can transform into Mega Metagross and potentially pass a Substitute and boosts of its own. Additionally, teammates that Imposter-proof Mega Metagross are typically forgone due to being very hard to fit, allowing Chansey to usually Baton Pass to a teammate with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry Users</strong>: Lum Berry users, such as Mega Mewtwo X, Huge Power Mega Gyarados, and Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, can take a Dark Void and heavily damage or OHKO Mega Metagross. Mega Mewtwo X and Knock Off or Beat Up Gyarados in particular can threaten Taunt Mega Metagross effectively in a one-on-one scenario, as they are able to OHKO it. However, these are only short-term checks to Dark Void Mega Metagross due to Lum Berry being one-time use.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Multi-hit move users, in particular Beat Up Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gyarados, are able to break Mega Metagross's Substitute and threaten an OHKO on it. However, Dark Void Mega Metagross can put them to sleep if they lack a way to circumvent it, and multi-hit moves may miss against boosted Minimize sets.</p> <p><strong>Faster Prankster Users</strong>: Faster Prankster users, like Arceus and opposing speed-crept Mega Metagross, can disrupt Mega Metagross with Taunt, Encore, or Spore. However, these are very hard to fit and are difficult to justify using outside of being a Mega Metagross check.</p> <p><strong>Status Orb Users</strong>: Toxic Orb and Flame Orb users, such as Magic Guard Ho-Oh and Poison Heal Mega Gyarados, can check Dark Void Mega Metagross due to not being affected by sleep. Ho-Oh and Yveltal can offensively threaten it with Flare Blitz and Knock Off, respectively. However, these are hard to fit due to being vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, and they are largely ineffective against Minimize sets.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Prankster Mega Metagross is an effective Substitute + Baton Pass user due to its good defensive typing into most Wonder Guard and -ate users, decent overall bulk, and Prankster + Dark Void effortlessly giving it free turns for setup. Dark Void and Coil synergize well because Coil boosting accuracy remedies Dark Void's accuracy problems. Dark Void allows Mega Metagross to disrupt non-Magic Bounce switch-ins thanks to priority from Prankster and often lets it Baton Pass both a Substitute and Coil boosts to a teammate. Likewise, Taunt and Minimize work well together because Taunt disables Prankster Giratina’s moves, allowing Mega Metagross to rack up evasion boosts, as most opposing attacks either miss or fail to break Substitute. Substitute is essential to Mega Metagross's purpose, as offensive teammates enjoy being able to take a hit from most revenge killers while attempting to set up and sweep. Leftovers keeps Mega Metagross healthy and allows it to use Substitute more frequently over the course of the game; in the majority of games, it is sufficient recovery for Mega Metagross to function effectively. Prankster Mega Metagross differentiates itself from Wonder Guard Substitute + Baton Pass users by preventing Prankster Giratina from immediately forcing it out with Encore or Spore. A specially defensive EV spread is used so Mega Metagross's Substitute can take a hit from unboosted Xerneas's Moonblast and Sky Plate Mega Rayquaza's Oblivion Wing and so it can more effectively tank Boomburst from users like Pixilate Mega Diancie and Arceus.</p> <p>Setup Mold Breaker users appreciate Mega Metagross's ability to pass them Substitutes and Coil or evasion boosts immensely. In return, they can threaten Magic Bounce users that can come in on Mega Metagross and bounce back Dark Void or Taunt. Dark Void + Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza in particular is a great teammate, as it appreciates both Coil's accuracy increase allowing it to use Dark Void against foes with impunity and Minimize boosts putting Prankster Giratina in a bind due to Oblivion Wing offsetting damage from Curse, therefore forcing it to use Encore—which can miss—instead. Bulkier offensive Pokemon, like Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, work well with both Coil and Minimize Mega Metagross because Defense boosts from Coil make them harder to revenge kill, while Minimize boosts allow them to fish for misses against Prankster Giratina's Encore and attacks from revenge killers. Magic Bounce Giratina excellently Imposter-proofs Mega Metagross, though the need for robust revenge killers due to forgoing Prankster Giratina means it is difficult to fit. Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users that threaten Giratina, namely Xerneas, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Gengar, are also valuable teammates due to their ability to switch into Huge Power or Protean-boosted coverage moves that Mega Metagross may defensively struggle with. Prankster Giratina, support Wonder Guard users, and revenge killers are essential due to their ability to switch into offensive Mold Breaker users, remove entry hazards and act as clerics, and offensively check most opposing attackers, respectively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mold Breaker Mega Latios is an incredibly powerful sweeper that threatens the vast majority of the metagame with its Soul Dew-boosted attacks. Spore and Dark Void allow for easier setup with Shell Smash while also heavily disrupting teams. Shell Smash bolsters Mega Latios's offensive prowess, boosting its Special Attack and Speed enough to OHKO bulky Pokemon such as Mega Audino after Stealth Rock, Primal Kyogre, Arceus, and Yveltal. The boost to Speed also lets Mega Latios outspeed every Pokemon in the metagame, bar some Choice Scarf users such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y. Psystrike and Spacial Rend complement each other well; Spacial Rend is the primary STAB move, and OHKOes or 2HKOes the majority of foes after Shell Smash, while Psystrike handles special walls like Blissey, Chansey, and Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh more reliably. King's Shield is an option over Spore and Dark Void to improve Mega Latios's match up against priority revenge killers such as Shadow Tag Regigigas, Aerilate Mega Rayquaza, and Huge Power Mewtwo Mega X running Extreme Speed. King's Shield also has additional utility in letting Mega Latios scout sets from offensive Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. 96 Speed EVs allow Mega Latios to outspeed neutral natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. The rest is put into HP to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Mega Latios, an offensive powerhouse, is generally run on fast offense and bulky offense teams. Mega Latios operates best on teams utilizing two Mold Breaker users, as Mega Latios lacks recovery and relies too much on its item to be a good standalone Mold Breaker user; in particular, it pairs well with other bulky Mold Breaker users like Primal Groudon and Mega Tyranitar. Mega Latio's weakness to Pursuit users such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal means it wants to be paired with checks to these such as Xerneas or Shadow Tag Mewtwo Mega X. It also likes Pokemon that can deal with very specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, Ho-oh, and some Primal Kyogre variants, as these can tank Mega Latio's attacks decently; physical wallbreakers like Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Gyarados can be paired with Mega Latios to fix this issue. Running a revenge killer alongside Mega Latios, such as an -ate user or Shadow Tag Regigigas, can be helpful versus Imposter users, as Pokemon that can safely Imposter-proof Mega Latios are very rare, and offensive Imposter-proofing is usually more effective. If running an -ate user, entry hazards like Stealth Rock are useful to keep up the pressure. Substitute + Wonder Guard Pokemon typically also run Defog and Aromatherapy to help keep Mega Latios and other Mold Breaker Pokemon healthy over the course of longer games.</p>"

Protean Mega Latios can run a timid nature to outspeed most opposing Mega Latios and Mega Diancie at the cost of worse KO rolls on various Wonder Guard users and Giratina with super effective attacks. Other coverage moves may be used on Protean Mega Latios based on team needs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Attackers:</strong> Mega Latios's most significant threats are priority attackers that can revenge kill it like Shadow Tag Regigigas, -ate Speed users, and Huge Power + Extreme Speed attackers like Regigigas, Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo X., and Huge Power Dark-type Pokemon can cause mind games with the combination of Sucker Punch + Pursuit</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users:</strong> Shadow Tag users such as Mega Mewtwo X and Choice Scarfed Primal Groudon can outspeed and deal immense damage to Mega Latios or remove its Soul Dew with Trick. However, they cannot come in safely on Mold Breaker Mega Latios.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users:</strong> Many Pursuit users, like -Ate Speed users and Huge Power Mega Gyarados, also carry moves to threaten Mega Latios, leading to coinflip scenarios where it can either be OHKOed by the opponent's powerful attacks or a switching-boosted Pursuit</p> <p><strong>Item Removal:</strong> Getting rid of the source of Mega Latios's power via Knock Off or Trick makes it much less effective.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Users:</strong> It is difficult to Imposter-proof Mold Breaker Mega Latios, as very little can survive attacks from it while boosted. Choice Scarf imposter variants are still able to KO your Mega Latios despite the Special Defense boost from Soul Dew.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Users:</strong> Most Prankster Users cannot safely switch into Mega Latios's attack, but can lock Mold Breaker variants into Shell Smash with Encore or use Destiny Bond, Glare, or Curse as an emergency stop.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard Ho-Oh:</strong> While rare, Magic Guard Ho-Oh can wall most Protean Mega Latios with its good typing and phenomenal special bulk, annoying it with status spreading in Psycho Shift. However, Ho-Oh is usually easily threatened by a physical Mold Breaker, Huge Power Pursuit user, or physical Shadow Tag user.</p> <p><strong>Fast Mold Breaker Users:</strong> Fast Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar and Mega Rayquaza can outspeed Mega Latios and either put it to sleep or OHKO it while still threatening damage to the rest of its team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Protean Mega Latios uses its ludicrously high Soul Dew-boosted Special Attack and four coverage moves to dismantle opposing Wonder Guard cores, along with slower non-Wonder Guard Pokemon. Flash Cannon targets and OHKOes both Xerneas and physically defensive Mega Audino, as well as making Mega Latios resistant to all -ate Speed attacks via Protean, making it more difficult to revenge kill. Grass Knot targets Primal Kyogre and Mega Swampert while OHKOing Primal Groudon, but it doesn't always OHKO specially defensive variants of Primal Kyogre. An alternative is Freeze-Dry, as it also hits Giratina and Gyarados for super effective damage at the cost of only 2HKOing Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. It also hits the rare Ice-weak Wonder Guards like Zapdos and Landourus, but usually this doesn't matter due to how infrequently they are used. Secret Sword OHKOs Wonder Guard Blissey and Chansey, but only 2HKOes physically defensive Arceus and Slaking. Aura Sphere can be used to OHKO Arceus and Slaking, but it doesn't break through Chansey on only 2HKOes Blissey. Searing Shot threatens Mega Scizor as well as the occasional Registeel and Mega Steelix, and Earth Power threatens all Primal Groudon variants as well as Wonder Guard Mega Manectric, Skuntank, and Drapion. Moonblast OHKOes both Mega Sableye and Giratina. Bug Buzz OHKOes Mega Mewtwo Y, most Cresselia, and Deoxys-S, stopping them from safely passing a Substitute to a teammate using Baton Pass. Lastly, Gastro Acid can negate the opposing Pokemon's Wonder Guard but is often a momentum drain.</p> <p>Mega Latios fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, where Choice item Mold Breaker userss like Mega Rayquaza, Primal Groudon, and Mega Mewtwo Y help Mega Latios against opposing Wonder Guard cores it can't break through on its own, threatening them for huge damage. Furthermore, Mega Latios can consistently force opposing Wonder Guard users in, gaining momentum for these wallbreakers. Additionally, Huge Power and Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X pair well with Mega Latios as their coverage can break through opposing Wonder Guard users that Mega Latios can't. Mega Gyarados heavily threatens Prankster Giratina and Ho-Oh, Pokemon that can switch in on Mega Latios. Aromatherapy is also appreciated, as paralysis often hampers Mega Latios's offensive presence, and it dislikes taking chip damage from burn and poison. Mega Latios performs particularly well with a slow Substitute + Baton Pass teammate like Wonder Guard Xerneas, Skuntank, Mega Swampert, or Mega Sableye, as it will safely threaten opposing teams while being more difficult to revenge kill.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD with an Adamant nature and Water Shuriken can be used to revenge kill Shell Smash + Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and Mega Diancie at -1 Defense, but this has little other utility. A Chesto Berry alongside Whirlwind, Nuzzle, or Glare can make Primal Kyogre a safer check to Dark Void variants of Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie, albeit only once. Blue Orb makes Primal Kyogre immune to Trick, reduces damage from Mold Breaker Knock Off, and helps it Imposter-proof Trick + Choice Specs Mold Breaker and Trick + Choice Scarf No Guard teammates. Leftovers allows Primal Kyogre to use Recover less frequently, potentially maintaining momentum for its team. However, sacrificing Shed Shell's resistance to Shadow Tag users makes Primal Kyogre more difficult to use.</p> <p>Though Primal Kyogre already struggles with four-moveslot syndrome, it can nevertheless viably run a myriad of other support options. Nuzzle allows Primal Kyogre to disrupt the opposing team while also making it more resilient versus Taunt users. In addition, the most relevant Pokemon immune to the move—Primal Groudon—doesn't want to switch into Primal Kyogre. However, Nuzzle + Scald Primal Kyogre sets can make Imposter-proofing more difficult, as the two moves combined can disrupt virtually every non-Wonder Guard user. Glare is another paralysis option that does affect Primal Groudon, should that be necessary, but leaves Primal Kyogre more vulnerable to Taunt and is less effective versus Magic Bounce users. Chatter is another Taunt-resistant disruption option for minimum Speed variants of Primal Kyogre to disrupt Pokemon receiving Substitute from faster Baton Pass users. Perish Song is an alternative to Whirlwind that puts Substitute + Baton Pass Magic Bounce users, which are immune to Whirlwind, on a timer. Magic Coat reflects sleep moves from Mold Breaker users, Parting Shot and Stealth Rock from -ate Speed users like Mega Abomasnow, and Sing, Gastro Acid, Taunt, and Spider Web from No Guard users. Parting Shot is an alternative to Baton Pass that fares worse against Magic Bounce users but better against Curse and Gastro Acid users. Finally, Primal Kyogre is also a decent user of Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, though its inability to threaten common Magic Bounce users means it requires greater team support.</p> <p>Thanks to its sky-high Special Attack stat, Primal Kyogre can also run a decent Shell Smash + Wonder Guard set with an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, a Modest nature, Judgment, and a Meadow Plate. Notably, Primal Kyogre's +2 Meadow Plate Judgment OHKOes standard Primal Groudon, allowing it to forgo its STAB move for additional coverage. A Choice Specs + Mold Breaker set is also a viable option, as its STAB Steam Eruption OHKOes and 2HKOes large swathes of the metagame; Giratina, opposing Primal Kyogre, Blissey, and very bulky RegenVest users are some of the only switch-ins to Steam Eruption. Additionally, Choice Specs Primal Kyogre can make use of coverage moves like Moonblast, Ice Beam, Freeze-Dry, and Secret Sword to break through those aforementioned checks, leaving it with few true switch-ins.</p> <p>Finally, it's worth noting that on teams with three or more Primal Kyogre—colloquially known as spam teams—fringe Primal Kyogre sets such as Huge Power + Water Shuriken, RegenVest, Parental Bond, and Magic Bounce have significantly increased viability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Despite its impressive bulk, like any Wonder Guard user, Primal Kyogre is vulnerable to OHKOs from powerful foes carrying the right coverage, such as Petal Blizzard Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X and Grass Knot Protean Mega Latios. Additionally, Primal Kyogre's popularity as a Wonder Guard user means that most teams are prepared to face it, making such coverage moves more common. King's Shield variants of Primal Kyogre, however, can scout the aforementioned foes and somewhat mitigate the unfavorable matchup.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Unless it's holding Blue Orb, Trick users can saddle Primal Kyogre with a Choice item for the entirety of the match, forcing it to either use Baton Pass or relinquish momentum. Additionally, Poison-type Trick users like Mega Beedrill can Trick Primal Kyogre their Black Sludge, forcing Primal Kyogre to use Recover more often and making it easier to KO.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Despite Primal Kyogre's incredible bulk, Shell Smash + Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar and Arceus can still break through it with decent sleep turn luck. Mold Breaker Mega Latios doesn't even need sleep or luck, as it can just power through Primal Kyogre's weaker Defense with Psystrike. In addition, if Primal Kyogre forgoes King's Shield, it's also forced out easily by Choice Band Mold Breaker users like Mega Rayquaza, and even by Shell Smash Primal Groudon if Primal Kyogre isn't fully healthy.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Like is the case with most defensive Wonder Guard users, Prankster Giratina can come in on virtually every Primal Kyogre set and force it out with Encore or chip it with Will-O-Wisp. Giratina dislikes getting burned by Scald, however. Further, teammates running Huge Power + Pursuit, in particular Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar, can discourage Giratina from switching in on Primal Kyogre.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: If Primal Kyogre forgoes or loses its Shed Shell, it's very vulnerable to offensive Shadow Tag users. Baton Pass can mitigate this weakness to some extent, though never completely.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt forces out almost all variants of Primal Kyogre that forgo Scald. Even Scald variants find themselves unable to support their team versus Taunt users.</p>",

      "Wonder Guard Support": {
        "description": "<p>Massive special bulk, pure Water typing, a flexible Speed tier, and forcing out metagame titan Primal Groudon make Primal Kyogre one of the format's best support Wonder Guard users. Scald is an extremely useful STAB move that OHKOes all variants of Primal Groudon and Mold Breaker Mega Diancie. Additionally, Scald's burn chance makes switching in risky for threats like physical Mega Rayquaza. Alternatively, since even the threat of Scald is good at forcing out Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre can forgo its STAB attack to provide pivoting support with Baton Pass. Defog and Aromatherapy are extremely valuable support options on the majority of team structures. However, if a teammate is carrying either one, Primal Kyogre can opt to use King's Shield or Whirlwind. The former gives Primal Kyogre a scouting tool and improves its matchup against physical Mold Breaker users such as Mega Rayquaza. Whirlwind, on the other hand, exploits Primal Kyogre being notoriously difficult for many special Mold Breaker users and powerful special coverage moves, excluding Protean Mega Latios's Grass Knot, to OHKO. Primal Kyogre can also use both Baton Pass and Scald by forgoing one of its standard utility moveslots, though this type of set is usually restricted to teams with room for multiple defensive Wonder Guard users. Finally, recovery is essential for Primal Kyogre to fill its role as a support Wonder Guard user effectively. Wish synergizes well with King's Shield and can support Primal Kyogre's teammates, but Recover is usually preferred for its immediacy and greater ease of use. A Calm nature and a specially defensive EV spread allow Primal Kyogre to tank hits from specially offensive Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie, as well as scouting powerful special coverage moves from attackers such as Wonder Guard + Shell Smash Mega Gardevoir and Protean Mega Mewtwo Y. A physically defensive EV spread with a Bold nature is an equally viable option, however, as this set checks Primal Groudon with greater ease and offers better mixed bulk for scouting Pokemon, such as Mega Rayquaza, that can run both physical and special sets. A Sassy or Relaxed nature alongside 0 Speed IVs can be run on Baton Pass variants of Primal Kyogre to better bring teammates in safely. A Shed Shell is the preferred item to make Primal Kyogre more resilient versus Shadow Tag users. However, Safety Goggles can be used to make Primal Kyogre a harder check to Spore + Mold Breaker users; special ones such as Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie for specially defensive Primal Kyogre, or Primal Groudon and Mega Tyranitar for physically defensive sets.</p> <p>The vast majority of team structures appreciate the utility that Primal Kyogre can provide. Notably, Primal Kyogre works very well alongside the popular Mold Breaker Primal Groudon + Wonder Guard Xerneas + Prankster Giratina core, defensively covering most offensive threats alongside Xerneas and Giratina. Giratina is a notable partner outside of this core as well, though, as it can easily switch into Huge Power- and Protean-boosted Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Primal Kyogre. In return, specially defensive Primal Kyogre can soft check powerful Ghost- and Fairy-type attackers like Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie for Giratina, particularly if running Safety Goggles and Whirlwind. Primal Kyogre's vulnerability to Protean Mega Latios and Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X means it appreciates teammates that can force them out, such Pixilate Mega Diancie, Aerilate Mega Rayquaza, offensive Shadow Tag users such as Mega Mewtwo Y, and faster No Guard users like Mega Aerodactyl. In addition, those same teammates make excellent entry hazard setters, thus synergizing especially well with Whirlwind variants of Primal Kyogre. Many Choice Specs + Mold Breaker users—such as Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y—appreciate specially defensive Primal Kyogre efficiently Imposter-proofing them. On bulkier balance teams, Primal Kyogre can be run alongside another defensive Wonder Guard user—such as Cresselia, Mega Scizor, or Mega Audino—for more flexibility with both their movesets. Finally, Pursuit users such as Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Yveltal, and Mega Tyranitar are excellent teammates to pressure Giratina, Primal Kyogre's most common non-Wonder Guard switch-in.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Primal Groudon can run a variety of moves that help it support its team and match up better against Giratina, such as Glare, Sacred Fire, Sheer Cold, U-Turn, and Knock Off. Earth Plate and Life Orb can improve damage rolls on Shell Smash sets. Choice Band Sets can run various priority moves to revenge kill some offensive threats after chip damage. It can also run entry hazards to set up for better rolls later. More Speed EVs can be given to both Mold Breaker Primal Groudon sets if they wish to outspeed a specific threat. Mold Breaker Primal Groudon can run a special set with Earth Plate + Judgment. Shadow Tag Primal Groudon can use various coverage moves to target specific Wonder Guard users. Recovery moves may also be used on Shadow Tag Primal Groudon for longevity. Surf may also be used to OHKO opposing Primal Groudon without needing to worry about damage rolls with Thousand Arrows.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Prankster Giratina uses its immense bulk to severely diminish Primal Groudon's offensive presence with Glare and force Shell Smash sweeper variants out with Encore. However, it can be hindered through with Dark Void from Shell Smash variants, Beat Up from Choice Band variants, and Trick from Shadow Tag + Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Imposter users</strong>: The strong neutral coverage of Thousand Arrows makes Imposter users able to easily countersweep if they copy a boosted Primal Groudon. Choice Band and Shadow Tag variants are both forced out by Imposter as well. Primal Groudon sets with Dark Void are more susceptible to countersweeps because they can then deal with a healthy Giratina. Choice Scarf Imposter users are more manageable, as they are forced to choose only one move.</p> <p><strong>Huge Power Mega Gyarados</strong>: Huge Power Mega Gyarados can OHKO Primal Groudon not running bulk with Water Shuriken and deal immense damage to it with Pursuit if it switches. It needs to be wary of using Pursuit as Primal Groudon uses King's Shield, however.</p> <p><strong>Other Revenge Killers</strong>: Many -ate Speed users and Huge Power revenge killers can force unboosted Primal Groudon out with their priority attacks. However, many of these fail to revenge kill Primal Groudon if it runs King's Shield. Some Choice Scarf + No Guard users, like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-S, outspeed any Primal Groudon even after a Shell Smash and can OHKO it. Additionally, Choice Scarf + Shadow Tag users, like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y, can outspeed many Mold Breaker Primal Groudon sets and OHKO it with a special Water-type move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Hard Hitters</strong>: In a one-on-one scenario, faster Pokemon that are sufficiently strong, such as Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, Protean Mega Latios, and Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y or Mega Rayquaza, can force Primal Groudon out. Some Shell Smash + Wonder Guard users, such as Xerneas, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Lucario can OHKO Primal Groudon if boosted.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon that Primal Groudon often switches in on, like Xerneas, Wonder Guard Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Manectric, can run Water-type moves to catch it off guard and OHKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With its amazing physical bulk, incredible offensive typing, ridiculous Attack stat, nifty immunity to the otherwise problematic Will-O-Wisp, and great synergy with other metagame titans, Primal Groudon is the single most threatening offensive Pokemon in the metagame. Every team must prepare for Primal Groudon heavily in the teambuilder, and most teams use one defensive check and one offensive check. Spore or Dark Void allows Primal Groudon to set up against its most common switch-in, Giratina; Spore has 100% accuracy and allows for Imposter-proofing with Safety Goggles Prankster Giratina, while Dark Void affects opposing Safety Goggles users. Stealth Rock is another option, as Primal Groudon forces numerous switches and can use the free turn to set entry hazards. Taunt lets Primal Groudon consistently beat Giratina, which almost always runs four status moves, but is far less useful against its other checks like Primal Kyogre. Shell Smash allows Primal Groudon to boost both its Attack and Speed in a single turn, synergizing well with disruption in Spore, Dark Void, or Taunt. Thousand Arrows is virtually unresisted in the metagame, meaning Primal Groudon can often run a single attack and have tremendous flexibility with its moveset. King's Shield creates mind games with opposing revenge killers, often rendering them null as a threat; V-create is another good choice that allows Primal Groudon to immediately threaten bulky unresisted foes, such as Wonder Guard Slaking, Mega Audino, and Cresselia, much more effectively, forcing them out more often. Primal Groudon has several options for its item; Leftovers synergizes particularly well with King's Shield and increases Primal Groudon's longevity, Lum Berry potentially gifts Primal Groudon a free turn to set up, and Mental Herb allows Primal Groudon to set up against Prankster Giratina lacking Glare or Spore much more easily, nearly always forcing a sack. Mold Breaker allows Primal Groudon to ignore Wonder Guard, allowing it to take full advantage of Thousand Arrows's amazing neutral coverage. The given spread maximizes physical bulk while allowing Primal Groudon to outspeed Pokemon with 150 base Speed, such as Deoxys-Attack and Mega Aerodactyl, after a Shell Smash; an Adamant nature further increases Primal Groudon's offensive prowess, allowing it to 2HKO Giratina after Shell Smash.</p> <p>Primal Groudon fits on nearly every team structure, as its combination of base stats, great STAB moves, and ability to threaten other top metagame threats' checks make it too good to forgo. Prankster Giratina is Primal Groudon's best partner, as it can Imposter-proof Primal Groudon and use Will-O-Wisp or Glare to grant Primal Groudon more opportunities to set up. Giratina also has the option of running Destiny Bond, which is especially useful against Huge Power Mega Gyarados, a common switch-in to Primal Groudon. Despite its impressive bulk, Primal Groudon appreciates being brought in safely by Substitute + Baton Pass users like Wonder Guard Xerneas and Magic Bounce Giratina. Specially offensive Mold Breaker users like Mega Diancie, Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza, and Dialga are great partners to threaten Giratina. In particular, Dialga is an excellent partner, as it can check Gale Wings users and Mega Gyarados lacking Sucker Punch, two common revenge killers to Primal Groudon. Offensive Wonder Guard users, like Xerneas, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Lucario, are also quite good at forcing out most revenge killers that otherwise take full advantage of unboosted Primal Groudon. As Giratina is Primal Groudon's greatest obstacle, Huge Power Mega Gyarados is a great partner; it can also potentially force out a chipped Imposter user. Physically defensive Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre, as well as Wonder Guard Mega Swampert, are good partners as well due to their ability to check unboosted Imposter users; the latter can also run a Substitute + Baton Pass set to allow offensive teammates to set up more easily. Lastly, Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X is a good partner, as with bulk investment it can survive Lum Berry Huge Power Mega Gyarados's Sucker Punch and OHKO back with a Fighting-type attack.</p>"

      "Choice Band + Mold Breaker": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band + Mold Breaker Primal Groudon is one of the most powerful Choice item attackers in the metagame due to its incredible STAB moves, great defensive typing, immunity to burns, and amazing bulk. V-create is a ludicrously powerful STAB move that threatens the entirety of the unresisted metagame, notably OHKOing physically defensive Wonder Guard Slaking, Arceus, Mega Audino, and Cresselia after Stealth Rock. In contrast, Thousand Arrows is a virtually unresisted STAB move that is more spammable than V-create thanks to having no drawbacks, freely threatening slower Pokemon, such as Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas and Wonder Guard Mega Scizor, alongside paralyzed offensive Pokemon, like opposing Primal Groudon, chipped Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza, slightly damaged Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Gengar. Beat Up is a great coverage option to heavily damage Prankster Giratina and the rare Mega Slowbro, which would ordinarily switch in on Choice Band Primal Groudon. Alternatively, Precipice Blades still 2HKOes Giratina while also threatening non-Flying-types much more effectively than Beat Up; however, opposing Prankster Giratina has a good chance to successfully fish for a miss by repeatedly using Recover. Knock Off item removal can be useful when forcing mind games, especially against defensive Wonder Guard users running Shed Shell when running a Shadow Tag teammate, and it still threatens Magic Bounce Giratina if Giratina has an intact item and even slight chip damage. Trick is a great option to incapacitate Prankster Giratina, supporting offensive and Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard teammates by shutting down their largest counter. U-turn allows Primal Groudon to retain momentum for its team, as well as continually forcing chip damage against its main check in Giratina. Primal Groudon outspeeds most relevant threats without Speed investment at +2, and the extra HP investment helps it survive -ate Speed from users like Abomasnow.</p> <p>Primal Groudon works best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to force coinflip scenarios against slower teams and create momentum for offensive teammates. Prankster Giratina benefits Primal Groudon greatly by Imposter-proofing it thanks to its massive physical bulk and V-create resistance. Since opposing Prankster Giratina is Primal Groudon's most common switch-in, Huge Power Dark-types that can remove it with Pursuit, such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal, are valuable partners for it; they can also heavily damage most Choice item + Shadow Tag users, which pick a weakened Primal Groudon off. In particular, Mega Gyarados is great, as it can also switch into an opposing Shell Smash Primal Groudon if healthy and force it out with Water Shuriken. Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users allow Primal Groudon to come in safely with a Substitute, helping it beat offensive Pokemon like opposing Primal Groudon and Protean Mega Latios one-on-one. In particular, Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas has great utility in forcing Prankster Giratina and most Magic Bounce users out with Moonblast, and it can run a diverse array of support options in its filler moveslot, such as Stealth Rock, Defog, Aromatherapy, paralysis support in Glare, Dark Void, Taunt, and even Wish or Shell Smash support for Primal Groudon. Special Mold Breaker users, especially more powerful ones like Mega Latios, Mega Diancie, Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza, and Dialga, can force Giratina out after Primal Groudon uses U-turn. Paralysis support from the likes of Prankster Giratina, as well as select support Wonder Guard users, can make Primal Groudon even more threatening by providing free turns. Also, Primal Groudon can force out paralyzed offensive threats like Mega Gengar, Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y lacking a Choice Scarf, Mega Latios, and special Mega Rayquaza. Shadow Tag users can work well with Knock Off Primal Groudon, as the likes of Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre and bulky Gastro Acid + Wonder Guard users like Arceus are secondary switch-ins to it. Entry hazard setters, such as Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users, defensive Wonder Guard users, and bulky Mold Breaker teammates, can bolster Primal Groudon's offensive prowess, as the additional chip damage from Stealth Rock affects Primal Groudon's KO rolls in a wide variety of instances. Defensive Wonder Guard users can provide Defog and Aromatherapy support, keeping Primal Groudon healthy over the course of a game.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band, Choice Specs Mold Breaker, and Aerilate Mega Rayquaza can run other coverage moves to more effectively threaten a variety of Pokemon such as Giratina, Xerneas, and Arceus. Spore and Taunt may be run for disruption on Aerilate sets, but entry hazards, Boomburst, and Pursuit are usually too valuable to replace. A Jolly or Timid nature can be run on Choice item Mold Breaker sets to outspeed most opposing Mega Rayquaza, but they sacrifice damage against Giratina and important damage rolls with Aeroblast, like not always 2HKOing specially defensive Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock. Choice Band Mega Rayquaza can use entry hazards to capitalize on the switches it forces. Extreme Speed on Choice Band sets can pick off weakened foes; it does fail to threaten bulkier sweepers like Primal Groudon and Dialga, though Water Shuriken can be run for the former. U-turn over Volt Switch on Choice Specs sets can threaten Blissey significantly more and pivot against Primal Groudon, but the better damage from Volt Switch is usually preferred. Both Choice Band and Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza can run slower EV spreads and invest in Defense, which helps them tank hits from Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Slaking, and Regigigas at the cost of being outsped by opposing Mega Rayquaza. Substitute sets can run Taunt over Dark Void to shut down Blissey and Giratina. Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza can also run Cotton Guard + Quiver Dance, which allows it to resist many revenge killing attempts that would otherwise threaten a standard set, but the longer setup time and susceptibility to countersweeps from Imposter Chansey make it a niche pick. Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza run either physical or special Shell Smash sets with Dragon Ascent and Aeroblast, respectively, but doing so can be difficult to Imposter-proof. Sky Plate, Shed Shell, or Life Orb can be run on Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza while forgoing Trick, allowing it to run a higher variety of support moves. However, even with favorable rolls from Life Orb, the extra damage from Choice Specs is usually required in order to consistently KO certain threats like Primal Groudon with Oblivion Wing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: A healthy Prankster Giratina can reliably switch into both Choice Band and Substitute Mega Rayquaza to check it with Destiny Bond, Glare, or a well-timed Encore; it must be wary of Dark Void and Taunt from Substitute Mega Rayquaza, however.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Chansey</strong>: Imposter Chansey forces out all common variants of Mega Rayquaza. Even though Substitute blocks Imposter, Whirlwind lets Chansey tank and force out Substitute + Oblivion Wing variants. It can also be very threatening if it copies Aerilate or Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza with Taunt or Spore.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Offensive Shadow Tag users, like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y, can consistently trap and KO Mega Rayquaza with their powerful attacks. Shadow Tag Regigigas is particularly dangerous for its reliability in removing most Mega Rayquaza with Fake Out + Extreme Speed. Perish Song + Shadow Tag users such as Lugia and Arceus can eliminate Mega Rayquaza as well, but not as reliably.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: -Ate users and Mega Gyarados can OHKO Mega Rayquaza with Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch; the latter can also punish a switch with Pursuit. Mega Diancie is of note for surviving a boosted Oblivion Wing and always OHKOing Substitute variants with Boomburst. However, the increased priority given to Flying-type moves by Gale Wings means variants of Mega Rayquaza with this ability do not have to worry about being knocked out by Mega Gyarados's Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Specially defensive Blissey walls both Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza and Substitute Mega Rayquaza, though the latter can break through with good sleep turn luck.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Users</strong>: Most Wonder Guard users can switch into Gale Wings and Aerilate Mega Rayquaza. While some need to be wary of Taunt, Trick, and Spore, their immunity to Mega Rayquaza's attacks makes them reliable and consistent checks.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock punishes Mega Rayquaza for its frequent switching, making it fail to survive most revenge killing attempts. Oblivion Wing sets can heal back the damage, however.</p> <p><strong>King's Shield Users</strong>: Activating King's Shield negates any threat that Choice Band Mega Rayquaza may pose, and it can be used to scout against Choice Specs variants.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Rayquaza uses its sky-high Attack stat primarily to obliterate foes with its STAB Dragon Ascent, which deals huge damage to everything that doesn't resist it. Sacred Fire is used to hit Steel-type Pokemon, such as Wonder Guard Mega Scizor, Registeel, and Mega Steelix; it also finds great utility in its 50% burn chance, which constantly chips at bulky switch-ins like Prankster Giratina while weakening opposing Imposter users. Precipice Blades is another good option, OHKOing Mold Breaker Mega Tyranitar from full health and Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock. Crabhammer can be used to OHKO Primal Groudon and KO Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock, while Trick invalidates would-be checks like King's Shield users and Giratina by forcing them to stick to one status move. Extreme Speed is a great option for picking off weakened foes, especially with Mega Rayquaza's high Attack stat and Choice Band. U-turn takes advantage of Mega Rayquaza demanding switch-ins, as it allows you to conserve momentum. Mega Rayquaza's Mold Breaker allows it threaten opposing Wonder Guard users, letting it keep momentum even more effectively.</p> <p>Rayquaza's most common check is Prankster Giratina, so naturally anything that can beat it pairs well with Mega Rayquaza. Mega Gyarados is an amazing option, as it can force coinflip scenarios against Giratina with its Huge Power-boosted Pursuit and Knock Off. Special Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie can continuously pressure Giratina. Mega Gengar in particular is amazing for its Speed, which lets it take care of fast threats that Mega Rayquaza can't; notably it Speed ties with Mega Mewtwo X and outspeeds opposing Mega Rayquaza, Timid Mega Latios, and Timid Mega Diancie. Slow pivots like Mega Audino, Mega Scizor, and Cresselia, allow Mega Rayquza to get into the field safely, capitalizing on its potential to pressure many Pokemon with its devastating attacks once in. Mega Rayquaza also appreciates the help from Aromatherapy and Defog users like Primal Kyogre and Mega Audino to remove status and Stealth Rock. This set can also be paired with a Choice Specs Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza as not only do they defeat each other's checks, but the opponent lack reliable counterplay due to not knowing which set is in. Mega Rayquaza pairs well with -ate Speed Pokemon because it takes advantage of their ability to force opposing Wonder Guards users in.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Rayquaza's incredibly high mixed attacking stats and offensive typing make it a powerful revenge killer. Aerilate-boosted Fake Out and Extreme Speed allow Mega Rayquaza to reliably revenge kill most No Guard users and Mold Breaker + Shell Smash sweepers, with exceptions being Flying-resistant Pokemon like Dialga, Zekrom, and Mega Tyranitar as well as King's Shield users like Primal Groudon. Boomburst is a dizzyingly powerful move that is used to deal massive damage to Giratina, who otherwise soaks up Extreme Speed. Gastro Acid punishes Wonder Guard switch-ins by allowing Mega Rayquaza to use its powerful STABs against them. Stealth Rock and Spikes can also be used instead to capitalize on the switches Aerilate Mega Rayquaza forces. Pursuit is used to punish Wonder Guard switch-ins and take advantage of the pressure Mega Rayquaza puts on opposing Pokemon with its STAB attacks. Sacred Fire is used to spread burns across the opponent's team while hitting the likes of Mega Scizor, Genesect, and Escavalier. Sky Plate is used to allow Mega Rayquaza's Boomburst to 2HKO Giratina while also boosting Extreme Speed. Lum Berry is an option that allows Mega Rayquaza to switch into Spore, Glare, Will-O-Wisp, and other status moves from Pokemon such as Prankster Giratina.</p> <p>Aerilate Mega Rayquaza fits best on balance teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo X and Y, most No Guard users, and Primal Groudon after chip, provided they aren't running King's Shield. Since Aerilate Mega Rayquaza lacks both a defensive profile and ways to consistently damage opposing Wonder Guard users, it appreciates both defensive and other offensive Pokemon such as Wonder Guard Xerneas or Wonder Guard Mega Audino, as well as common Mold Breaker users such as Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar, and Mega Diancie. Aerilate Mega Rayquaza also loves teammates such as Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre and Prankster Giratina, as it lacks recovery and can be worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and offensive Pokemon such as Pixilate Mega Diancie. Primal Kyogre provides entry hazard control through Defog and Giratina can threaten and force out opposing set-up sweepers and Wonder Guard users with Encore and Curse. Shadow Tag Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo X and Y are also great teammates, as they are able to trap and remove common Wonder Guard Pokemon that lack Shed Shell such as Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band, Choice Specs Mold Breaker, and Aerilate Mega Rayquaza can run other coverage moves to more effectively threaten a variety of Pokemon such as Giratina, Xerneas, and Arceus. Spore and Taunt may be run for disruption on Aerilate sets, but entry hazards, Boomburst, and Pursuit are usually too valuable to replace. A Jolly or Timid nature can be run on Choice item Mold Breaker sets to outspeed most opposing Mega Rayquaza, but they sacrifice damage against Giratina and important damage rolls with Aeroblast, like not always 2HKOing specially defensive Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock. Choice Band Mega Rayquaza can use entry hazards to capitalize on the switches it forces. Extreme Speed on Choice Band sets can pick off weakened foes; it does fail to threaten bulkier sweepers like Primal Groudon and Dialga, though Water Shuriken can be run for the former. U-turn over Volt Switch on Choice Specs sets can threaten Blissey significantly more and pivot against Primal Groudon, but the better damage from Volt Switch is usually preferred. Both Choice Band and Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza can run slower EV spreads and invest in Defense, which helps them tank hits from Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Slaking, and Regigigas at the cost of being outsped by opposing Mega Rayquaza. Substitute sets can run Taunt over Dark Void to shut down Blissey and Giratina. Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza can also run Cotton Guard + Quiver Dance, which allows it to resist many revenge killing attempts that would otherwise threaten a standard set, but the longer setup time and susceptibility to countersweeps from Imposter Chansey make it a niche pick. Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza run either physical or special Shell Smash sets with Dragon Ascent and Aeroblast, respectively, but doing so can be difficult to Imposter-proof. Sky Plate, Shed Shell, or Life Orb can be run on Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza while forgoing Trick, allowing it to run a higher variety of support moves. However, even with favorable rolls from Life Orb, the extra damage from Choice Specs is usually required in order to consistently KO certain threats like Primal Groudon with Oblivion Wing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: A healthy Prankster Giratina can reliably switch into both Choice Band and Substitute Mega Rayquaza to check it with Destiny Bond, Glare, or a well-timed Encore; it must be wary of Dark Void and Taunt from Substitute Mega Rayquaza, however.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Chansey</strong>: Imposter Chansey forces out all common variants of Mega Rayquaza. Even though Substitute blocks Imposter, Whirlwind lets Chansey tank and force out Substitute + Oblivion Wing variants. It can also be very threatening if it copies Aerilate or Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza with Taunt or Spore.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Offensive Shadow Tag users, like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y, can consistently trap and KO Mega Rayquaza with their powerful attacks. Shadow Tag Regigigas is particularly dangerous for its reliability in removing most Mega Rayquaza with Fake Out + Extreme Speed. Perish Song + Shadow Tag users such as Lugia and Arceus can eliminate Mega Rayquaza as well, but not as reliably.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: -Ate users and Mega Gyarados can OHKO Mega Rayquaza with Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch; the latter can also punish a switch with Pursuit.

      "Choice Specs + Mold Breaker": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Rayquaza's amazing offensive stats, good Speed tier, and great STAB moves make it a powerful wallbreaker with Choice Specs. Draco Meteor is extremely powerful and heavily damages most potential switch-ins, like specially defensive Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Notably, Draco Meteor also OHKOes Huge Power Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock and Imposter Chansey lacking Eviolite. Special Rend is a weaker option that still reaches important benchmarks, like OHKOing Giratina and 2HKOing specially defensive Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock, while not pressuring Mega Rayquaza to switch out. Aeroblast is a secondary STAB move that threatens Fairy-types like Xerneas and Mega Audino; Oblivion Wing is an alternative that greatly increases Mega Rayquaza's longevity. Additionally, Mega Rayquaza can also run Oblivion Wing in the third moveslot, which increases its longevity while giving it three powerful STAB moves, though it will fail to break through the occasional Registeel. Searing Shot targets Steel-types like Registeel and the rare specially defensive Mega Steelix; Secret Sword 2HKOes standard Registeel while also threatening Wonder Guard Blissey. Trick dismantles what defensive counterplay the opposing team has for Mega Rayquaza. Volt Switch allows Mega Rayquaza to retain momentum, taking advantage of its uncanny ability to force switches and force the most prominent Ground-type in Primal Groudon out. A Modest nature allows Mega Rayquaza to OHKO Primal Groudon forgoing bulk EVs, offensive Arceus, and Mold Breaker Mega Tyranitar from full health, as well as OHKOing bulky Primal Groudon variants after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Specs + Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza works well on balance and bulky offense teams that can capitalize on its ability to force switches, as well as providing it support. In particular, it works well with the ubiquitous core of Mold Breaker + Shell Smash Primal Groudon, Prankster Giratina, Baton Pass + Wonder Guard Xerneas, and Huge Power Mega Gyarados. Primal Groudon appreciates Mega Rayquaza bringing in checks like specially defensive Primal Kyogre, Blissey, and the occasional Registeel and Ho-Oh; in return, Primal Groudon forces Giratina in. Prankster Giratina can deter most opposing setup attempts and use Will-O-Wisp or Glare to potentially dismantle Shadow Tag users, which often can revenge kill Mega Rayquaza. Wonder Guard Xerneas can pass Substitutes or Shell Smash boosts to Mega Rayquaza with Baton Pass, the latter potentially enabling a sweep; additionally, it can lure Primal Groudon in. Huge Power Mega Gyarados can heavily damage offensive Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza with Pursuit and Sucker Punch, as well as revenge killing Choice item Shadow Tag users that remove Mega Rayquaza—bar the occasional Play Rough Mega Mewtwo X. Specially defensive Pokemon, like Primal Kyogre, Blissey, Registeel, and Ho-Oh, are able to Imposter-proof Mega Rayquaza, though the latter two are difficult to fit. Offensive Wonder Guard users, like Mega Lucario, Xerneas, and Mega Gardevoir, are good to threaten Wonder Guard Xerneas while also luring Prankster Giratina in (if the latter two are not running Moonblast). Revenge killers, like Refrigerate Kyurem-B, Pixilate Mega Diancie, Imposter Chansey, and Shadow Tag Regigigas, threaten opposing sweepers that can otherwise wreak havoc if coming in after Mega Rayquaza KOes a foe. In particular, Refrigerate Kyurem-B and Imposter Chansey work well, as the former can OHKO both Choice Scarf and Eviolite Imposter Chansey with Icicle Plate-boosted Extreme Speed, and the latter also Imposter-proofs Mega Rayquaza. Defensive Wonder Guard users can provide Defog, cleric, and Wish support for Mega Rayquaza; many of them, in particular slow ones like Blissey, Mega Audino, and Escavalier, are also excellent at safely pivoting Mega Rayquaza in. Finally, Mega Rayquaza can be run with Choice Band + Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza to keep the opponent guessing when one Mega Rayquaza is sent out, provided both Pokemon have the same HP percentage.</p>"

      "Gale Wings Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<p>Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza uses its phenomenal Special Attack and priority Flying-type STAB move to revenge kill most offensive threats. Chatter often OHKOes opposing Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon behind a Substitute after a Shell Smash defense drop and is mainly used for this ability. Additionally, the confusion inflicted by Chatter also bolsters the chances of KOing opposing Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon. Oblivion Wing and Aeroblast with Choice Specs are the primary moves to revenge kill opposing threats. Oblivion Wing has immense recovery and more PP at the cost of worse damage rolls on Mold Breaker Xerneas and unboosted threats like Primal Groudon. Aeroblast can be instead used for its increased power, but it comes at the cost of low PP, a chance to miss, and not providing any longevity. Trick is used to greatly hinder Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza's most common answers in Wonder Guard users. Taunt shuts down many Wonder Guard users that would usually be able to safely switch into Mega Rayquaza, like Mega Audino and Blissey. Stealth Rock and Spore capitalize on the switches it often forces, the former by setting up entry hazards for its teammates for free and the the latter by being an incredible tool for disruption and letting its teammates find free turns. Stealth Rock often pairs well with Trick, since support Wonder Guard users will always have to choose between pivoting and getting rid of hazards once they are given Choice Specs, losing their momentum if they choose the latter and keeping hazards up if they choose the former.</p> <p>Because of Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza's ability to consistently revenge kill Primal Groudon, opposing Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Gengar, it often finds itself on Mold Breaker-oriented offense teams with teammates that can take advantage of its revenge killing consistency. Mold Breaker sweepers like Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar, Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Latios appreciate it for this reason. Another Choice item + Trick user like Choice Scarf Mega Mewtwo Y can work wonders in dismantling the opponent's team by neutering two of its members for the rest of the match. Offensive Wonder Guard users like Xerneas and Gyarados can Imposter-proof Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza, as they don't have to worry about Taunt. Wonder Guard Gyarados holds its Mega Stone, making it immune to Trick and therefore a notably good partner. Huge Power Mega Gyarados further bolsters a team's revenge killing power when paired with Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza while providing strong offensive support, such as with Gastro Acid + Pursuit.</p>"

      "Oblivion Wing": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Rayquaza uses Substitute and Oblivion Wing to resist the vast majority of revenge killing attempts, including priority moves like Fake Out + Extreme Speed and Mega Gyarados's Sucker Punch. This allows it to sweep easily thanks to Mold Breaker, which allows it to hit opponents through Wonder Guard. Dark Void provides the free turns necessary to set up Substitute and Shell Smash; unlike Spore, it is not blocked by Safety Goggles. The recovery from Oblivion Wing not only offsets the initial Substitute damage, but also can offset damage from Curse and Will-O-Wisp. Sky Plate or Life Orb is crucial to break past specially defensive Blissey, and they help against Primal Kyogre. Sky Plate is typically the preferred option since it does not have the recoil of Life Orb, even though Life Orb sets break through Blissey more easily. If teammates can break through Blissey, Shed Shell can be run to escape various Shadow Tag users such as Regigigas, Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Mewtwo X, and Primal Groudon. The EV spread allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Mega Mewtwo Y after a Shell Smash boost while maximizing bulk.</p> <p>Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza fits on a plethora of teams, from hyper offense to bulky teams, thanks to its reliable sweeping and wallbreaking prowess. It is usually run with another wallbreaker, such as Mega Gyarados, Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, or Mega Mewtwo X or Y, as these options threaten special walls like Wonder Guard Blissey and Primal Kyogre. Mold Breaker Primal Groudon with Shell Smash is especially notable, as it can set up and become notoriously difficult to revenge kill. Therefore, it and Substitute Mega Rayquaza make a fantastic dual Mold Breaker core. Mega Rayquaza also pairs well with users of Spikes and Stealth Rock, such as Shadow Tag Primal Groudon and Wonder Guard Xerneas, since they further restrict its already limited pool of switch-ins. Substitute + Baton Pass teammates, like the aforementioned Wonder Guard Xerneas, make sure it doesn't have to spend a turn setting up Substitute.</p>"

Deoxys-A can opt for Shell Smash over Substitute; it can run a Wonder Guard Shell Smash set with Spooky or Insect Plate Judgment and two other non-Ghost-, Dark-, or Bug-type coverage options, though it is inconsistent due to its vulnerability to Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Deoxys-A can opt for Huge Power and Protean coverage sets, though the increased Speed compared to Mega Mewtwo X is usually not worth it because of its substantially lower bulk and Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X's ability to run priority moves if desired. No Guard and Mold Breaker Deoxys-A are other options, as it is faster than Mega Mewtwo X and Y and is not meaningfully less powerful, though the vulnerability to priority due to its frailty makes these sets not worth running in most situations.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Shadow Sneak users, like Mega Mewtwo X, Slaking, and Regigigas, OHKO Deoxys-A when it isn't behind a Substitute. Additionally, Shadow Sneak Slaking and Regigigas often run Pursuit, meaning Deoxys-A cannot safely switch out much of the time. Huge Power Dark-types like Mega Gyarados threaten niche offensive sets with Sucker Punch, Water Shuriken, and Pursuit, though Substitute + Baton Pass sets can easily escape Pursuit. Mold Breaker Extreme Speed users, like Slaking and Primal Groudon, also threaten Deoxys-A.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X with Beat Up can safely remove Substitute + Baton Pass Deoxys-A, as it outspeeds and OHKOes it. Choice Scarf Shadow Tag Primal Groudon can also opt for a super effective move, such as Knock Off or Beat Up. Additionally, Choice Scarf Shadow Tag users running Trick can hinder Substitute + Baton Pass Deoxys-A by Choice-locking it. Niche Choice Scarf + No Guard Deoxys-A sets are not threatened by Choice Scarf + Shadow Tag users, but are trapped by Shadow Tag Slaking and Regigigas.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Magic Bounce users, like Giratina and Aegislash, are able to comfortably switch into Deoxys-A's Psystrike and bounce back Taunt and Dark Void. However, some Magic Bounce users, like Mega Venusaur, are unable to come in on Psystrike, and Magic Bounce users may be forced out by niche offensive Deoxys-A sets.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Prankster Giratina can use Encore on Deoxys-A's Substitute to force it out or use Glare on Deoxys-A not behind Substitute to severely hinder it. However, it becomes setup fodder if it switches into Taunt or Dark Void. Prankster Giratina can also get surprised by niche offensive sets, like No Guard.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Wonder Guard Deoxys-A is an effective Substitute + Baton Pass user due to its nearly uncontested Speed, STAB Psystrike, and low defenses allowing for offensive counterplay to opposing Imposter users. Gastro Acid removes opposing Mold Breaker and Wonder Guard, allowing Deoxys-A to set up Substitute more easily and threaten some Wonder Guard users with Psystrike. Alternatively, Taunt annoys most non-Magic Bounce and Mold Breaker foes, disabling Prankster Giratina's moves if used on the switch, as well as passive Wonder Guard users lacking a way to hit Deoxys-A. Dark Void works much like Taunt while acting as more effective team support if a foe is kept asleep for multiple turns, though the consequence of using it against a Magic Bounce user is greater if Deoxys-A isn't behind a Substitute, and it can miss. Psystrike is its preferred attack due to 2HKOing most offensive foes and threatening Wonder Guard Mega Beedrill. Substitute + Baton Pass is a potent combination, especially with Wonder Guard, because it allows a teammate a turn to safely set up in most scenarios. Leftovers is used so Deoxys-A can more easily set up Substitute multiple times over the course of a match. A Hasty nature with 0 Defense IVs makes Imposter users transformed into Deoxys-A as physically frail as possible, allowing for offensive counterplay, such as Shadow Sneak and Choice Scarf Beat Up users, against them. A Timid nature with 31 Defense IVs is also usable, though the ability to offensively threaten Imposter users is a core advantage Deoxys-A has over other Substitute + Baton Pass users.</p> <p>Substitute + Baton Pass Deoxys-A appreciates teammates that are able to capitalize on a passed Substitute and patch up its weaknesses. Mold Breaker Shell Smash users, in particular Oblivion Wing Mega Rayquaza, Primal Groudon, and Xerneas, are good teammates because, behind a Substitute, they have an opportunity to use Shell Smash or a disruption move like Dark Void and Taunt and are resistant to the majority of revenge killers. Mold Breaker Xerneas in particular does not fear Huge Power Mega Gyarados if healthy even if it runs Beat Up, making it a synergistic partner. Deoxys-A is also good on Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X archetypes, since with good prediction a Mega Mewtwo X behind a Substitute with the right coverage moves is difficult to stop, though such teams have a difficult time fitting in either proper revenge killing or a support Wonder Guard user. Similarly, Protean users, like Mega Latios and Mega Mewtwo Y, appreciate passed Substitutes, though both Pokemon initially share the same weaknesses as Deoxys-A and therefore can't hard switch in as easily if necessary. Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers, like Mega Gardevoir, appreciate Deoxys-A's ability to pass Substitutes, though potentially not hitting many Wonder Guard users and giving up a moveslot for Shell Smash make passed Substitutes not as useful as with Mold Breaker and Huge Power teammates. Prankster Giratina, support Wonder Guard users that don't share Deoxys-A's weaknesses, and robust revenge killers, in particular Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Shadow Tag Slaking and Regigigas, and Pixilate Mega Diancie, are great teammates due to offering a switch-in to Mold Breaker, Huge Power, and Protean users on prediction, Defog and Aromatherapy support, and priority for offensive foes, respectively.</p>"

Any other entry hazard over Stealth Rock can similarly take advantage of the switches Deoxys-S forces. Recover can offset the chip damage Deoxys-S often takes throughout a game, reenabling Focus Sash if it is able to heal up to full. Taunt is another option that prevents recovery from Wonder Guard switch-ins, in addition to Baton Pass pivoting and entry hazards. Spider Web Deoxys-S can trap and remove Wonder Guard users that don't have a pivoting move or Shed Shell, but these are extremely rare and often not worth the moveslot. Other coverage options such as Moonblast, Gunk Shot, and Petal Blizzard are available to hit specific Wonder Guard users such as Mega Sableye, Xerneas, and Mega Swampert, respectively. Lum Berry allows Deoxys-S to avoid debilitating status one time and lets it beat Prankster Giratina one-on-one, but the overall utility of Focus Sash leaves it outclassed. Leftovers lets Deoxys-S be worn down less.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Cores</strong>: While Deoxys-S can handle a single Wonder Guard user due to Gastro Acid, two or more Wonder Guard users often pose a problem, as they can freely switch between each other and stall the PP of Gastro Acid. However, Stealth Rock from Deoxys-S can wear them down over time.</p> <p><strong>Opposing No Guard Users</strong>: Deoxys-S will always Speed tie itself, forcing mind games between Sheer Cold, Sing, and Taunt if applicable. No Guard users with a Choice Scarf can also outspeed and revenge kill Deoxys-S if its Focus Sash has been broken.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Deoxys-S is quite frail, so priority moves are a big threat, especially if its Focus Sash has been broken. Huge Power users like Mega Gyarados and Mega Mewtwo X can use Water Shuriken and Extreme Speed, respectively, to pick off Deoxys-S. Pixilate and Refrigerate users like Mega Diance and Kyruem-B can use Fake Out + Extreme Speed to dispose of Deoxys-S before it can move. Gale Wings users like Mega Rayquaza can revenge kill Deoxys-S, but these are rare and only work if its Focus Sash has broken. Shadow Tag Slaking and Regigigas immediately remove Deoxys-S with Extreme Speed if they can get in safely and Deoxys-S has taken any prior damage.</p> <p><strong>ResidualDamage</strong>: Without Recover, all residual damage will stack up, and even a tiny bit such as Stealth Rock damage can break Focus Sash, making Deoxys-S much less effective.

Sing allows Deoxys-S to hinder checks with sleep while ignoring Substitutes and Safety Googles.

Stealth Rock takes advantage of Deoxys-S's ability to force switches and racks up chip damage on Wonder Guard users, its usual checks. Zap Cannon and Inferno benefit from No Guard and allow Dexoys-S to hit specific Wonder Guard users such as Gyarados and Mega Scizor; if these moves are run, an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is recommended.

Focus Sash alleviates Deoxys-S's bulk issues.</p> <p>Deoxys-S's main roadblock is a combination of two Wonder Guard users, which can continually swap into its Gastro Acid and waste its PP; therefore, anti-Wonder Guard measures are heavily recommended. Shadow Tag users such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, Primal Groudon, and Mega Latios can trap and remove Wonder Guard users lacking a Shed Shell, in particular Leftovers Wonder Guard Xerneas and Safety Goggles Arceus; in return, Deoxys-S can pressure Pokemon like Giratina and offensive Mold Breaker users for them. Mold Breaker users with Knock Off like Mega Gyarados can remove Shed Shells from Wonder Guard users, allowing Shadow Tag users to remove them more efficiently; this lets Deoxys-S clean up teams more efficiently. Powerful Mold Breaker users such as Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios can brute force their way past many a Wonder Guard user. Finally, Huge Power + Pursuit users like Mega Gyarados and Yveltal can fish for matchups against Wonder Guard users weak to Pursuit, such as Cresselia, Meloetta, and Dusclops.</p>"

    "comments": "<p>Focus Sash compensates for Mega Lopunny's poor bulk and allows it to freely switch moves. Sheer Cold is Mega Lopunny's primary weapon, OHKOing everything without Wonder Guard or fringe Sturdy. Sing takes advantage of Mega Lopunny's ability to force switches, putting opposing Wonder Guard switch-ins to sleep, and has additional utility through bypassing Substitute. Gastro Acid is used to force switches from Wonder Guard users that switch into Sheer Cold with impunity, allowing the user to use Sing on switches or make easier double switches into other teammates. Stealth Rock is used to sustain chip damage against opposing Wonder Guard users, while Dynamic Punch takes advantage of Mega Lopunny's Attack stat to threaten opposing Wonder Guard users weak to the move, such as Slaking, Arceus, and Mega Lucario. Maximum HP and Speed investment allows Mega Lopunny to outspeed as much as possible while also maximizing its overall bulk; If running attacking moves such as Dynamic Punch, HP investment should be forgone for Attack to maximize damage.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny usually benefits best from being placed on fast-paced Offensive teams that like to quickly gain momentum and force switches. Some notable teammates include Mold breaker users such as Primal Groudon and Mega Latios that take advantage of foes that are put to sleep by Mega Lopunny and also benefit from the chip damage Mega Lopunny gives with Stealth Rock. Shadow Tag Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Lugia are appreciated for their ability to remove Wonder Guard users and enable Mega Lopunny to sweep teams. However, Mega Lopunny will need sufficient hazard control if it hopes to keep it's Focus Sash intact. It benefits from Defog Users such as Wonder Guards and Magic Bounce users. These Pokemon also can slowly pivot so Mega Lopunny has a safer time getting on the field.</p> <h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spikes and Toxic Spikes are alternatives to Stealth Rock to better damage Rock-resistant foes and pressure Wonder Guard users lacking reliable recovery respectively. Sticky Web can help teams that want more speed control and enables slower partners such as Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, Mega Diancie, Mega Tyranitar, and Dialga. Mega Lopunny can use some attacks such as Sacred Fire, Gunk Shot, and Dynamic Punch. However, these are fishing for specific weaknesses of certain Wonder Guard users and are much more situational, so they generally aren't the best options. Lastly, substituting Sheer Cold for Fissure can work to target ground weak Wonder Guard Users Ground-weak Wonder Guard users, but this also falls under situational matchup fishing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Revenge Killers</strong> Mega Lopunny can be revenge killed in many ways, ranging from Extreme Speed users such as Regigigas, Slaking, and -ate speed users to Water Shuriken Mega Gyarados, Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza, and even Prankster Giratina running Spore, Dark Void, or Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Users</strong>: While Mega Lopunny is meant to dismantle and force switches between Wonder Guard users, they can still block Trick with items like Mail, Mega Stones, and Primal Orbs. Magic Coat or Magic Bounce users can bounce back Sing and Hazards. Some Wonder Guard users also run attacks such as Xerneas with Moonblast or Kyogre-Primal with Scald and can force Lopunny-Mega out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon, like Mega Mewtwo Y, Deoxys-S, and Choice Scarf users, can threaten Focus Sash Mega Lopunny out. Additionally, some Choice Scarf users, like Mega Mewtwo Y and No Guard Deoxys-S, can also outspeed Choice Scarf Mega Lopunny and threaten it. Choice Scarf Shadow Tag users, like Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon, can outspeed and KO chipped Focus Sash Mega Lopunny. However, most of these options require pivoting support from Wonder Guard teammates to come in on Mega Lopunny safely, and Choice Scarf users naturally slower than Mega Lopunny, like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo X, are at risk of getting outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Mega Lopunny.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mega Lopunny's high-Speed stat makes it a good No Guard user, as Speed is integral to this utility-centered role. Sheer Cold, which always hits due to No Guard, can OHKO any foe without Wonder Guard or the fringe Sturdy. This allows Mega Lopunny to force opposing Wonder Guard users in with ease. Trick allows Mega Lopunny to disrupt opposing Wonder Guard users; it's best to use Trick early, as getting rid of Choice Scarf gives Mega Lopunny more opportunities to force switches due to Gastro Acid. Mega Lopunny capitalizes on the switches it forces with either Stealth Rock, for entry hazard control and chip damage, or a sleep move like Sing to put opposing Wonder Guard users to sleep. Sing is significantly better than most sleep moves for bypassing Substitute. Mega Lopunny shouldn't afraid to make double switches, as it all but ensures an opposing Wonder Guard user comes in; making double switches is even easier if opposing Wonder Guard users are asleep, or if one is Tricked.</p> <p>Mega Lopunny benefits from slow pivot teammates such as Magic Bounce Giratina and Wonder Guard Pokemon with Parting Shot or Baton Pass. This is because Mega Lopunny is rather frail and needs to get on the field in a safe way. Mega Lopunny is generally used on teams that lack utility or ways to forcibly gain momentum. Mega Lopunny nearly always needs an offensive Pokemon, such as Primal Groudon, Mega Latios, Mega Mewtwo X, or Mega Mewtwo Y, to help back it up and capitalize on the switches and momentum Mega Lopunny gives.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch can be used to surprise KO an attacking Mold Breaker user like Mega Gengar or heavily chipped Mold Breaker Mega Latios after Shell Smash. Spikes and Sticky Web are alternatives to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes if their specific utility is desired. Parting Shot can be used over Baton Pass to weaken the foe as it pivots out; however, Parting Shot cedes momentum to teams with a Magic Bounce user, making it more matchup-dependent. Haze can be used to clear boosts from Shell Smash users like Wonder Guard Xerneas, preventing them from setting up on Skuntank. Toxic can be used to status and make progress against Wonder Guards like Xerneas and Arceus, forcing a switch into an Aromatherapy user. Additionally, because of Skuntank's Poison typing, it can freely use Toxic against Pokemon that may run Magic Bounce like Giratina. Poison Fang is an alternative to Toxic that gives Skuntank the ability to damage Fairy-type Woner Guard users and status foes without being susceptible to Taunt. Whirlwind gives Skuntank the ability to phase out setup sweepers like offensive Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mold Breaker Mega Gengar. Mail can give Skuntank an immunity to Trick, though this item provides no other utility and is greatly outclassed by Shed Shell. Black Sludge can be used to give Skuntank some passive healingand punish Trick users like Choice Scarf Prankster Giratina. Alternatively, Trick can be used by Skuntank itself to passively chip a foe. Finally, 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD EVs with a Sassy Nature can be used to Imposter-proof Choice Specs Mold Breaker Mega Mewtwo Y more effectively, thanks to Skuntank's immunity to Psystrike and Psycho Boost.</p> <p>Drapion can be used instead of Skuntank if its slightly higher physical Defense and faster Speed tier are desired.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Skuntank is vulnerable to being OHKOed by No Guard users carrying the somewhat rare, but very dangerous, Fissure. This weakness can be mitigated by pairing Skuntank with another Wonder Guard user that is not weak to Ground or a Flying-type teammate like Mega Rayquaza or Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Ground-type coverage on offensive Wonder Guard users like Xerneas and -ate Speed users like Kyurem-B can catch Skuntank off guard on a switch, potentially scoring an early KO and rendering your team weak to No Guard Users like Mega Mewtwo Y and Huge Power Sweepers like Mega Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users</strong>: Trick Users like Choice Scarf Prankster Giratina can hinder Skuntank by removing its Shed Shell and reduce its support potential by locking it into one move. Skuntank can opt to mitigate this by either crippling the Trick user with Black Sludge or using Mail for an effective immunity to the move; Black Sludge carries the potential risk of being swapped to a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Skuntank's lackluster offensive stats relegate it to a support position, which can be shut down by Taunt users like Prankster Giratina. Moves like Knock Off and Poison Fang ensure that Skuntank will not be forced to use Struggle, while also having the chance to remove items or poison the foe, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Skuntank is forced out by offensive Mold Breakers due to its low defenses. Specifically, Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza can both OHKO physically defensive Skuntank after Stealth Rock.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Skuntank's main niche as a Wonder Guard user is its rare singular weakness to Ground and ability to clear Toxic Spikes upon switching in. Baton Pass allows Skuntank to provide pivoting support and maintain momentum, notably underspeeding common slow pivots like Cresselia, Magic Bounce Giratina, and Primal Kyogre. Toxic Spikes allows Skuntank to make progress in most games; Skuntank can also reliably clear any Toxic Spikes reflected by Magic Bounce or copied by Imposter. Knock Off and Pursuit threaten Pokemon like Mold Breaker Mega Gengar and coverage-reliant offensive Pokemon that have no way to hit Skuntank, such as No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y lacking Fissure and Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X lacking Thousand Arrows. Defog and Aromatherapy are staples on any support Wonder Guard user; however, if a teammate is already providing either, then Skuntank can opt for alternate utility options such as Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Knock Off. Recover gives Skuntank longevity, allowing it to heal off damage from hazards, status, or attacks that slip through Wonder Guard. Shed Shell allows Skuntank to escape Shadow Tag users like Choice Band Mewtwo Mega X and Perish Song Lugia, while Safety Goggles gives it immunity to Spore from Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar. Maximum HP and Defense investment maximizes Skuntank's physical bulk, allowing Skuntank to scout Mold Breaker Pokemon that could potentially run physical and special sets, such as Mega Rayquaza, and fare better against Mega Gengar. 0 Speed IVs give Skuntank the slowest possible Baton Pass to pivot into its team's attackers.</p> <p>Revenge killers such as Refrigerate Kyurem-B, Huge Power Slaking, and Regigigas make excellent teammates for Skuntank, as they appreciate Skuntank’s slow Baton Pass and pressure some of Skuntank’s most dangerous checks, namely Fissure + No Guard users like Mewtwo Mega Y and Mega Aerodactyl. Furthermore, because of its weakness to Fissure, Skuntank should almost always have both a Flying-type teammate—such as Mega Rayquaza or Ho-oh— and a Wonder Guard teammate that isn’t weak to Ground—such as Arceus or Xerneas. Additionally, offensive Wonder Guard teammates such as Mega Gardevoir, Xerneas, and Mega Lucario appreciate Skuntank’s ability to both soft-check Mold Breaker Mega Gengar and efficiently compress the roles of cleric and defogger. Finally, since Skuntank is quite passive, it benefits from strong Mold Breaker attackers like Choice Band Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon that can pressure Pokemon attempting to setup against Skuntank. In return, Skuntank can get them onto the battlefield safely with its slow Baton Pass. Dark-type Huge Power teammates like Mega Gyarados and Yveltal can effectively dispatch of Giratina with Pursuit and Knock Off, as Skuntank alone fails to threaten Giratina. Finally, offensive Shadow Tag Users like Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X appreciate Skuntank's ability to use Knock Off to remove Shed Shells from Psychic-type Wonder Guard users like Cresselia and Meloetta and non-Wonder Guard Support Pokemon like Registeel.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternate EV spread of 68 Atk / 252 SpA / 188 Spe alongside Bolt Strike is an option to OHKO physically defensive Primal Kyogre at +2 while still outpacing Jolly Primal Groudon. Similarly, a spread of 176 Atk / 252 SpA / 80 Spe with a Rash nature is an option alongside either Bolt Strike or Power Whip to OHKO Primal Kyogre while outpacing maximum speed Adamant Primal Groudon. A Timid or Naive nature is another option to outpace the somewhat rare Timid Mega Latios and Timid Mega Diancie.</p> <p>Flame Plate is an option over Fist Plate to hit Bug- and Steel-type Wonder Guard users. However, using Flame Plate means that Mega Lucario sacrifices the ability to hit Normal-type Wonder Guard users and OHKO Primal Groudon at +2 unless it also sacrifices its ability to beat Imposter users. Earth Plate is also an option over Fist Plate that trades hitting Normal-type Wonder Guard users for Electric-type Wonder Guard users while retaining the ability to KO Primal Groudon at +2. However, this version of the set faces fierce competition from Dialga, which has superior bulk, higher Special Attack, and lacks a Fire weakness.</p> <p>Mega Lucario also has a handful of other coverage options it can utilize. Bug Buzz does better against Cresselia than Knock Off, allowing Lucario to avoid mind games against King's Shield variants. Play Rough and Moonblast are both alternatives to hit Wonder Guard Mega Sableye; however, the former is an alternative to Knock Off that also OHKOes Mega Latios, while the latter offers similar coverage and hits harder overall. Scald can be used to OHKO Primal Groudon. Gastro Acid is an option to allow Mega Lucario to break through Wonder Guard users of any type at the somewhat steep cost of an additional turn to do so.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Like all Ground-weak Wonder Guard users, Mega Lucario is vulnerable to the somewhat uncommon but still very dangerous Fissure.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Mega Lucario is very frail both specially and physically. If a powerful unresisted attack pierces its Wonder Guard, Mega Lucario will almost certainly be KOed. In addition, all three of Mega Lucario’s weaknesses are to very common attacking types, which means that most teams have multiple attackers that can bypass Mega Lucario's Wonder Guard. In particular, Mega Lucario is weak to both of Primal Groudon's STAB attacks. Faster Mold Breaker attackers, such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar, as well as those that can tank a hit, such as Protean Mega Latios, are all highly threatening to Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Wonder Guard</strong>: Because Wonder Guard sweepers are inherently matchup dependent, Wonder Guard users that Mega Lucario is not packing the correct coverage moves for will force it out.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Trick, Switcheroo, and Mold Breaker Knock Off can severely impede Mega Lucario's ability to do its job, removing one-third of its coverage as well as its ability to beat Imposter users.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Offensive Shadow Tag users such as Primal Groudon or Mega Mewtwo X can pivot in on unboosted Mega Lucario and OHKO it. Very few offensive Shadow Tag users do not carry an attacking move that can KO Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Unless Mega Lucario is already boosted and just used a move that Giratina does not resist while it switches in, Prankster Giratina can come in freely on Mega Lucario and annoy it with Will-O-Wisp or Glare.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mega Lucario's decent typing for an offensive Wonder Guard user, quadruple resistance to Stealth Rock, strong attacking stats, and good base 112 Speed make it a powerful option for a Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweeper. The combination of Judgment and Fist Plate is a huge boon to Mega Lucario, allowing it to defeat Imposter users, Normal-type Wonder Guard users, and allowing it OHKO Primal Groudon after one Shell Smash. Flash Cannon and Gear Grind are both powerful STAB moves that hit Fairy-type Wonder Guard users. Flash Cannon's superior accuracy makes it the more consistent option and is slightly stronger against standard Wonder Guard Mega Audino. Gear Grind, on the other hand, is noticeably better against Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir, breaking the former's Substitutes and outright OHKOing the latter without a boost. The final moveslot is flexible, as it is both metagame- and team-dependent, but notable options include: Freeze-Dry, Grass Knot, and Knock Off. Freeze-Dry and Grass Knot both do well against Water-type Wonder Guard users like Primal Kyogre. The former's greater coverage usually make it the preferred option, but Grass Knot's increased Base Power versus certain targets such as Whirlwind Primal Kyogre is valuable as well. Knock Off is a useful option, as it OHKOes Mega Latios at +2. Without Knock Off, Mega Latios can take any other hit from Lucario—even at +2—and OHKO back. Knock Off also gives Mega Lucario a way of damaging Psychic- and Ghost-type Wonder Guard users and has the additional utility of removing items, making switch-ins without Wonder Guard less safe. A Rash nature is preferred if physical attacks are used; otherwise, a Modest nature is preferred.</p> <p>Mega Lucario fits best on balance and offense teams in need of a wincon and late-game cleaner. However, Mega Lucario differs from similar Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers like Mega Gardevoir and Xerneas, most notably because of its Fissure weakness, meaning that it appreciates teammates that can scout potential opposing No Guard users, such as Imposter users and slow pivots with Wonder Guard that don't share weaknesses with Mega Lucario, such as Cresselia, Slaking, and Primal Kyogre. In addition, a Flying-type teammate, such as Mega Rayquaza, can also help alleviate Mega Lucario’s Fissure weakness, as Sheer Cold + Fissure No Guard users are uncommon. Mega Lucario is also limited in its ability to beat certain Wonder Guard users, namely those weak to Fire- and Ground-type moves, without compromising its ability to beat Imposter users. As a result, Mega Lucario benefits from Choice Band Mold Breaker teammates that can break opposing Wonder Guard cores such as Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza. Offensive Shadow Tag teammates—Primal Groudon in particular—are also worth a mention, as they can trap and KO the Wonder Guard users Mega Lucario can't touch. Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users are also useful teammates, as they can give Mega Lucario additional opportunities to use Shell Smash and provide it some breathing room versus opposing Shadow Tag Primal Groudon, which would otherwise trap and KO Lucario. Finally, Mega Lucario also appreciates Aromatherapy, Defog, and Wish support from teammates such as the aforementioned slow pivoting Wonder Guard users to make its job as a wincon and late-game cleaner easier.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Abomasnow can opt for V-Create instead of Boomburst to threaten Magic Bounce Steel-types like Registeel, as well as OHKO Wonder Guard Mega Scizor and Escavalier. However, forgoing Boomburst means Mega Abomasnow has a much more difficult time checking Shell Smash Mold Breaker Primal Groudon running King's Shield, and V-Create's main targets in Magic Bounce Steel-types are relatively uncommon. Sacred Fire is an alternative option which can provide utility with burns, but is usually not worth it as it fails to OHKO Mega Scizor or 2HKO Mega Steelix. Pursuit can also be used over Boomburst to trap opposing Mega Gengar, weakened Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios after a Shell Smash; however, it has the high opportunity cost of not being able to be run with Boomburst and a support move. Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web are options over Stealth Rock, as Mega Abomasnow adequately threatens Flying-types, and its teammates appreciate the chip offered by poison from Toxic Spikes and the Speed drop from Sticky Web. The consistent damage of Stealth Rock is generally more useful, however. Baton Pass can work over Parting Shot, as it allows Mega Abomasnow to pass Substitutes it received from a teammate to another offensive teammate while still offering universal pivoting. Taunt can be used on the switch to disable Wonder Guard switch-ins running four status moves. Spore is another option that also disables them by putting them to sleep, and the opponent cannot put Mega Abomasnow to sleep with a well-timed Magic Bounce switch-in. Recover is a fringe option to keep Mega Abomasnow healthy, though the opportunity cost of not running a support move is high. Running coverage in the last one or two moveslots is an option, with possible options being Petal Blizzard, Freeze-Dry, Gunk Shot, Knock Off, Thousand Arrows, Close Combat, Low Kick, and Play Rough. If running Freeze-Dry, an alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpA with a Brave nature could be used to force recovery from physically defensive Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre, but the added bulk from investing in HP is generally more worthwhile. Leftovers is a niche option over Icicle Plate, as it increases Mega Abomasnow's longevity throughout the game; however, forgoing Icicle Plate means Mega Abomasnow misses out on the OHKO against Giratina with Boomburst.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Users</strong>: The vast majority of Wonder Guard users can switch in on Mega Abomasnow and render its Refrigerate-boosted attacks null. In particular, offensive Wonder Guard users are problematic, as they can't be revenge killed by Mega Abomasnow and, in a good matchup, can snowball through teams which have Mega Abomasnow as the sole setup check.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Offensive Shadow Tag users, especially bulky Mega Mewtwo X, can come in on Mega Abomasnow on a resisted move or Fake Out and OHKO it. In particular, Mega Mewtwo X with significant bulk investment and Primal Groudon are bulky enough to usually survive Fake Out into Extreme Speed and can OHKO Mega Abomasnow with Drain Punch or V-Create, respectively. However, most pivoting support is useless for offensive Shadow Tag users aiming to remove Mega Abomasnow due to its abysmal speed, and nearly all Shadow Tag users are vulnerable to getting KOed by Boomburst into Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Huge Power Mega Gyarados</strong>: Despite Mega Abomasnow investing in HP to increase its bulk, Huge Power-boosted Pursuits are problematic for it. In particular, Mega Gyarados is an issue, as it can come in on Fake Out, Extreme Speed, or Boomburst safely if healthy.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Steel-types</strong>: Magic Bounce Steel-types, such as Registeel and Mega Steelix, can prevent specific Mega Abomasnow sets from being able to support its team. However, Registeel can be threatened with V-Create or Sacred Fire, and Mega Steelix is blown past by Boomburst sets.</p>",

      "Refrigerate": {
        "description": "<p>Refrigerate Mega Abomasnow is an excellent revenge killer that differentiates itself from other -ate Speed users with its resistance to Thousand Arrows, immunity to Spore, and low Speed stat that allows it to underspeed many of the format's slow pivots. Fake Out and Extreme Speed form a potent combination that allows Mega Abomasnow to threaten chip against sweepers lacking King's Shield and revenge weakened foes with its strong priority STAB attacks. Fake Out on its own is also able to chip opposing sweepers lacking King's Shield, letting Mega Abomasnow hard switch into unboosted sweepers on a prediction and either chip them or force them out. Boomburst is an incredibly powerful STAB move that with an Icicle Plate OHKOes opposing Giratina and allows Mega Abomasnow to force non-Wonder Guard users out the majority of the time if healthy. Stealth Rock allows Mega Abomasnow to support its team through entry hazard setting, capitalizing on Mega Abomasnow's ability to force out offensive threats; Parting Shot and Gastro Acid are good alternative options, as the former helps to retain momentum against even slow pivot Wonder Guard users like Mega Audino and Primal Kyogre, while the latter forces most opposing Wonder Guard users to switch due to the threat of Boomburst and Extreme Speed. Since Boomburst already OHKOes Giratina without any investment, Abomasnow can throw its EVs into HP and Attack. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs minimizes Mega Abomasnow's Speed, giving it the ability to underspeed slow pivots like Wonder Guard Mega Audino and Chansey.</p> <p>Mega Abomasnow works best on teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill non-Wonder Guard sweepers, such as offense, bulky offense, balance, and dual Mega Mewtwo X teams. In particular, it works well with the ubiquitous Shell Smash Primal Groudon + Prankster Giratina + Wonder Guard Xerneas core, as even Prankster Giratina proves to be insufficient counterplay to opposing Mold Breaker Primal Groudon on its own. Offensive pressure from Primal Groudon helps retain momentum against teams that rely on Wonder Guard Xerneas to come in on Mega Abomasnow, especially if Mega Abomasnow runs Parting Shot; Prankster Giratina, especially variants running Will-O-Wisp, can switch in on healthy Huge Power users using a Fighting-, Fire-, Poison-, or Steel-type attack and force them out with either Encore or the threat of a burn. Wonder Guard Xerneas can pass Substitutes to Mega Abomasnow, which allows Mega Abomasnow to set Stealth Rock or threaten opposing switch-ins with Gastro Acid. Mold Breaker users, in particular slower ones like Mega Tyranitar, Choice item Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Latios, also appreciate Mega Abomasnow's ability to revenge kill faster threats. On faster offensive teams, Imposter Chansey is a good partner, as Mega Abomasnow struggles to deal with King's Shield sweepers; in return, Mega Abomasnow can threaten Mega Gengar and Mold Breaker Mega Diancie, two Pokemon Imposter Chansey can't prevent from setting up easily. Offensive Shadow Tag users, in particular Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios, are good partners for Parting Shot Mega Abomasnow due to being able to remove Wonder Guard users not running Shed Shell, such as Xerneas and Safety Goggles Primal Kyogre. Mega Abomasnow can work well on dual Mega Mewtwo X teams due to being a fairly reliable lone revenge killer, though it faces stiff competition from other -ate users such as Kyurem-B and Mega Rayquaza. Lastly, defensive Wonder Guard users are extremely valuable for Mega Abomasnow, as they can provide Defog, Aromatherapy, and Wish support, helping for removing entry hazards, protecting against Dark Void Mold Breaker sweepers, and providing for Mega Abomasnow's longevity respectively, while also disrupting Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users coming in and trying to set up with Whirlwind.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dark Void is an alternative over Spore that ignores opposing Safety Goggles but is usually not worth it, as switch-ins to Spore Dialga, such as Safety Goggles Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre and Blissey, are relatively rare. Glare and Taunt give more opportunities to set up with Shell Smash; Taunt more effectively deals with passive switch-ins, such as Primal Kyogre and Blissey variants forgoing Knock Off. Alternatively, Stealth Rock and other entry hazards can support Dialga's team, capitalizing on its good bulk and ability to force out much of the metagame when healthy, though Dialga often struggles to sweep without running a disruption move. Secret Sword could be used over Searing Shot to still threaten most Steel-types while also threatening Wonder Guard Blissey, but running the move means Dialga will not be able to OHKO Registeel, Mega Steelix, and Wonder Guard Mega Scizor. Recover is an option to greatly increase Dialga's longevity but sacrifices momentum and other generally more useful options. Dialga can opt to run Flame Plate + Judgment or Burn Drive + Techno Blast instead of Searing Shot, but its bulky Steel-type Imposter-proof will need to be replaced. On the other hand, the easy Imposter-proofing provided by Judgment and a Draco Plate or Iron Plate is usually more worthwhile. Leftovers gives Dialga more longevity, and Lum Berry allows Dialga to sweep more easily by curing status once; Leftovers also synergizes well with King's Shield. However, both items mean Dialga cannot make use of Plate + Judgment, making Imposter-proofing more difficult. If Leftovers is used, a spread of 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe with a Modest nature is preferred due to reaching a jump point in Leftovers recovery. Alternative spreads of 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe, 104 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 148 Spe, and 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, all with Modest natures, can be run on Dialga to outspeed Choice Scarf Shadow Tag Primal Groudon after a Shell Smash, Deoxys-S lacking a Choice Scarf after a Shell Smash, and Mega Mewtwo Y after Sticky Web when unboosted, respectively. However, these spreads sacrifice bulk and power, so they're almost never worth it.</p> <p>A Choice Specs set with Draco Meteor or Spacial Rend, Flash Cannon, Searing Shot, and Volt Switch is a viable option, as Dialga’s superior defensive typing gives it a niche over Mega Latios. Both Draco Meteor and Spacial Rend OHKO opposing Giratina, but the former is usually preferred, as it also OHKOes all Primal Groudon variants. Secret Sword could be run over Searing Shot, as it nails a would-be check in Wonder Guard Blissey, but running it gives Dialga a harder time breaking through opposing Mega Steelix and Mega Scizor. Alternatively, Trick hinders common switch-ins, like Wonder Guard Blissey and Registeel. Choice Specs Mold Breaker Dialga is often too slow to pose an effective threat against offensive teams and is much more vulnerable to offensive Shadow Tag users, namely Shadow Tag + Perish Song users like Lugia. Additionally, Dialga can run a fringe offensive Wonder Guard set with Shell Smash, Judgment with Earth Plate or Fist Plate, and two coverage moves to hit opposing Wonder Guard users and Prankster Giratina. Viable coverage options include Freeze-Dry, Grass Knot, Searing Shot, Moonblast, Bug Buzz, Night Daze, and Knock Off; coverage moves that can damage Dialga super effectively, such as Secret Sword, Aura Sphere, Thousand Arrows, and Earth Power, are to be avoided, as they prevent Dialga from Imposter-proofing itself. Gastro Acid could also be used over one of the coverage moveslots to threaten opposing Wonder Guard users in a wider range of matchups. Wonder Guard Shell Smash Dialga is an option, but it is mostly outclassed by Mega Lucario as a Steel-type Shell Smash Wonder Guard sweeper due to the latter's ability to OHKO Primal Groudon after Shell Smash with a STAB move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Offensive Shadow Tag users like Earth Power Mega Latios can threaten the vast majority of unboosted Dialga; certain Choice Scarf Shadow Tag users, such as Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Mewtwo X and Y, can threaten Dialga even after it boosts its stats. However, offensive Shadow Tag users usually cannot switch in to Dialga safely and require pivoting support to reliably switch in.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Most faster offensive Pokemon can threaten Dialga in a one-on-one situation, even if Dialga is healthy. In particular, Mold Breaker users that outspeed Dialga, such as Primal Groudon running more Speed investment, Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Latios, are threatening due to having relatively few switch-ins, so momentum is often lost to the opposing team. However, Dialga sets running King's Shield can mostly circumvent this issue against Choice item Mold Breaker users, as the opposing Pokemon's move is scouted. Huge Power, Protean, and rare Parental Bond users are also issues for Dialga, as they often force it out by threatening an OHKO; however, these Pokemon don't pose an immediate threat if Dialga is paired with Wonder Guard users. Choice Scarf No Guard users, such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Aerodactyl, can outspeed Dialga even after a Shell Smash and force it out; however, being Choice-locked is easily exploitable, and these Pokemon cannot outspeed boosted Dialga if they use Trick.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon, like Wonder Guard Blissey and Primal Kyogre, can switch into unboosted Dialga. In particular, Wonder Guard Blissey is difficult for Dialga to break through, especially if it is running Whirlwind or Knock Off. However, most specially defensive Pokemon can be broken through if Dialga gets enough free turns from disruption to accumulate sufficient boosts from Shell Smash. Magic Guard Ho-Oh can somewhat circumvent this by running Toxic Orb, though it is prone to getting removed by Shadow Tag users and cannot meaningfully pressure a healthy Dialga.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Power users like Slaking and Regigigas and -ate Speed users like Kyurem-B, Mega Diancie, and Mega Abomasnowcan pick off weakened Dialga lacking King's Shield, especially after a Shell Smash. Huge Power Dark-types with Knock Off also annoy healthy Dialga, forcing it to play mindgames between Knock Off and Pursuit. Additionally, Huge Power Dark-types with Sucker Punch can force coinflip scenarios against boosted Dialga, with Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar always OHKOing Dialga if a successful prediction is made. Imposter users can also usually dissuade Dialga sets not running Draco Plate from setting up by threatening a countersweep. However, no revenge killers bar Imposter Chansey can safely switch in on boosted Dialga without first sacking a teammate or being pivoted in.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Users</strong>: Prankster users besides Giratina, such as Yveltal and the occasional Registeel or Chansey, can switch into most Dialga sets and force it out with Encore or Haze, especially if they are running Safety Goggles. While it is generally discouraged from doing so, Prankster Giratina can also switch into Dialga after a prediction if need be and force it out with Encore. However, Prankster users aside from Giratina are relatively rare, and Prankster Giratina is threatened by Dragon-type STAB from Dialga.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Removing Dialga's Plate can severely hinder its sweeping ability, particularly if Dialga is running Draco Plate. Knock Off users, like Wonder Guard Blissey, can remove Dialga's item with relative ease; Prankster Trick users, while niche, can also annoy Dialga, especially when Dialga's Plate is removed by a Pokemon it ordinarily forces out, like Giratina. However, the opportunity cost of running item removal often dissuades switch-ins to Dialga from running Knock Off or Trick, and Prankster Trick users are quite rare.</p>",

      "Shell Smash Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Mold Breaker Dialga is a powerful sweeper due to its great STAB moves, great defensive typing, and good bulk. Spore creates setup opportunities for Dialga and allows for convenient Imposter-proofing with a Safety Goggles teammate. Alternatively, King's Shield takes advantage of Dialga's good bulk to more easily sweep teams reliant on Huge Power Slaking and Regigigas and -ate Speed users like Kyurem-B, Mega Abomasnow, and Mega Rayquaza to revenge kill boosted threats. King's Shield also grants healthy Dialga a slightly favorable chance to win the one-on-one against Choice Band Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X. Alternatively, Dialga can forgo Spore or King’s Shield for a set with Iron Plate, Judgment, Spacial Rend, and Searing Shot. Such a set hits much of the metagame super effectively and can be Imposter-proofed by Whirlwind Wonder Guard Blissey or fringe sets like specially defensive Mega Audino. Additionally, forgoing Draco Plate means Dialga can't lose access to its Dragon-type STAB move; thus, its offensive prowess is less easily hampered by Knock Off and Trick. Recover is an option to greatly increase Dialga's longevity, allowing it to set up on passive foes that can still chip it, like Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre running Scald, much more easily; however, forgoing King's Shield leaves boosted Dialga more vulnerable to Refrigerate and Pixilate users as well as Huge Power Slaking and Regigigas. Shell Smash bolsters Dialga's offensive prowess, allowing it to sweep a large portion of weakened teams after a boost. Dragon-type Judgment allows for easy Imposter-proofing with Giratina if forgoing Flash Cannon and hits slightly harder than Spacial Rend, notably OHKOing Aerilate Mega Rayquaza when unboosted and OHKOing offensive Arceus and Mega Mewtwo Y after Shell Smash. Spacial Rend is usable alongside Iron Plate Judgment, but this comes at the cost of Dialga becoming more difficult to Imposter-proof; it is worth noting, however, that Spacial Rend makes Dialga less vulnerable to Knock Off and Trick. Searing Shot complements Dialga's Dragon-type STAB moves well and threatens Steel-types like Registeel and Wonder Guard Mega Scizor and Escavalier. Alternatively, Flash Cannon threatens Fairy-type foes like Wonder Guard Xerneas, Mega Audino, and Mega Gardevoir much more effectively than Searing Shot. The given EV spread maximizes Dialga's overall bulk and damage output while outspeeding base 150 Speed Pokemon, like Mega Aerodactyl and Deoxys-A, after Shell Smash.</p> <p>Dialga works well alongside the metagame's most dominant core of Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, Prankster Giratina, and Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas. Dialga complements Primal Groudon by beating the revenge killers that it struggles with, such as Aerilate Mega Rayquaza and Huge Power Mega Gyarados if lacking Sucker Punch. Additionally, Dialga can threaten the most common switch-in to Primal Groudon in Prankster Giratina. In return, Primal Groudon can switch into most Wonder Guard Xerneas sets as well as checks to Dialga, such as Wonder Guard Blissey and Ho-Oh. Prankster Giratina can switch into opposing Primal Groudon for Dialga. Wonder Guard Xerneas can provide Substitute + Baton Pass support for Dialga and potentially set entry hazards, paralyze or Dark Void switch-ins, and function with high efficacy due to forcing opposing Giratina and Yveltal out. Other physical Mold Breaker users, such as Choice Band Mega Rayquaza and Mega Tyranitar, are also good teammates thanks to their ability to pressure Dialga's checks. Bulky variants of Choice Band + Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo X can OHKO Wonder Guard Xerneas while having the bulk to revenge kill bulky Lum Berry Huge Power Mega Gyarados if healthy, making it a great partner. Additionally, Choice Band + Shadow Tag Mega Mewtwo can switch into, trap, and remove Wonder Guard users like Arceus, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Manetric if they lack Shed Shell or don't use Gastro Acid. Huge Power Dark-types like Mega Gyarados can ease Dialga's setup by Pursuit trapping Prankster Giratina. Substitute and Shell Smash + Baton Pass Wonder Guard users aside from Xerneas, like Mega Swampert and Primal Groudon, can lure in Prankster Giratina and take advantage of mindgame scenarios to retain momentum by passing either a Substitute or Shell Smash boost to Dialga. Finally, defensive Wonder Guard users are great partners, as they can remove and set entry hazards, act as clerics, use Whirlwind to prevent Substitutes and boosts from being passed, and provide slow pivoting support for Dialga.</p>"

  "Regigigas": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regigigas can use other priority moves, such as Shadow Sneak for Mega Gengar, Water Shuriken for Primal Groudon, and Bullet Punch for Mega Diancie. However, without Huge Power, Water Shuriken needs to hit all 5 times to OHKO Primal Groudon with a Defense drop, and Shadow Sheak requires Life Orb to always OHKO opposing Mega Gengar after a Shell Smash, making these moves generally not worth running on a Regigigas with Shadow Tag. A set with Encore and Perish Song can be used on Shadow Tag Regigigas over Bullet Punch and Spikes in order to trap passive Wonder Guard users without Shed Shell as well as opposing sweepers running King's Shield that are locked into the move, but the utility of Spikes and Bullet Punch are usually not worth forgoing. Other entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Sticky Web can also be used in the place of Spikes, but Regigigas's ability to set multiple layers means Spikes is usually preferred. Other coverage options like Sacred Fire, Gear Grind, Low Kick, and Petal Blizzard can be used on both Huge Power and Shadow Tag Regigigas to hit Mega Beedrill, Mega Scizor, Xerneas, Mega Audino, Arceus, Slaking, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Swampert, but they generally aren't worth sacrificing a listed move for due to their matchup reliance. Fusion Bolt can be used over Petal Blizzard on Huge Power sets to always OHKO physically defensive Primal Kyogre at the cost of not affecting Primal Groudon and Mega Swampert. Recover is another option for the fourth moveslot, allowing Regigigas to heal off chip from entry hazards. Spore can disrupt the opponent's team. Mach Punch can be used to OHKO Mega Tyranitar after a Shell Smash if Regigigas runs Huge Power, and Bullet Punch does the same for Mega Diancie. Shed Shell is an option to escape opposing Shadow Tag users if Regigigas uses Huge Power. Lum Berry cures status once, most notably burn and sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wonder Guard</strong>: Normal is not super effective against any type, so all Wonder Guard users can come in freely on Regigigas's Fake Out or Extreme Speed and can usually heal or set entry hazards in front of it. However, they need to be wary of Gastro Acid + Pursuit on Huge Power Regigigas, and those lacking Shed Shell that underspeed Shadow Tag Regigigas, like Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas and Safety Goggles Primal Kyogre, fear the uncommon Encore and Perish Song set.</p> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: Giratina is not threatened by any of Regigigas's moves and is unable to be trapped due to its Ghost typing, allowing it to threaten Regigigas with crippling status moves or force it to switch. Magic Bounce sets can also prevent Regigigas from setting entry hazards, completely shutting it down. Giratina is weak to Pursuit from Huge Power Regigigas, but without switching Giratina is not threatened by it.</p> <p><strong>Normal-immune or Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon are immune or resistant to Normal such as Mega Gengar, Mega Tyranitar, and Dialga can't be effectively revenge killed by Regigigas and can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>King's Shield Users</strong>: By using King's Shield against moves like Fake Out or Extreme Speed, Pokemon like Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, Mold Breaker Xerneas, and Shadow Tag Lugia can easily withstand Regigigas's next attack and make it much less effective.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Users</strong>: Users of Imposter such as Blissey and Chansey can turn the tables on Regigigas, inflicting its own Extreme Speed + Pursuit coinflip scenario on it.</p> <p><strong>Shed Shell Users</strong>: Pokemon holding Shed Shell avoid being trapped by Shadow Tag Regigigas, removing its main niche and allowing them to freely switch to a Pokemon that can beat it. However, these Pokemon must be wary of getting their item removed by one of Regigigas's teammates.</p>",

      "Huge Power Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<p>Huge Power and STAB on both Fake Out and Extreme Speed make Regigigas an effective priority revenge killer. With its immense Attack, Pursuit and Extreme Speed combine to put foes in uncomfortable coinflip scenarios. Water Shuriken works in tandem with the Expert Belt to OHKO Primal Groudon after a Shell Smash, as Primal Groudon deters Extreme Speed with its use of King's Shield. Silk Scarf may be used to OHKO bulky Mega Mewtwo X, all Mega Rayquaza variants, and Mega Gyarados with Extreme Speed. Gastro Acid allows Regigigas to pressure opposing Wonder Guard Pokemon and force switches. Spikes takes advantage of said switches, which often lets Regigigas set multiple layers over the course of the game. Taunt is an option to deny support options that Wonder Guard Pokemon may have, as they are common switch-ins to Regigigas. Safety Goggles blocks Spore, allowing Regigigas to come in safely and subject the opponent to more coinflip scenarios.</p> <p>Huge Power Regigigas can work on a variety of teams due to its universal utility as a revenge killer, but it fits particularly well on offensive teams, since it can keep up pressure on the opponent. Regigigas appreciates Shadow Tag teammates such as Mega Mewtwo X, Primal Groudon, Lugia, and Arceus that can get rid of opposing Wonder Guard Pokemon, as once they are gone, there is little stopping it from steamrolling the opposing team. Mega Gyarados is also a huge help for Regigigas, as it can trap the Normal-immune Giratina with its devastatingly powerful Pursuit and threaten Primal Groudon with its own Water Shuriken. Aromatherapy users like Primal Kyogre and Blissey are also greatly appreciated, removing potential burns that would greatly hinder Regigigas's effectiveness. Blissey in particular can work well, as Regigigas also enjoys its Wish. Choice-locked Mold Breaker users like Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon can threaten opposing Wonder Guard Pokemon, such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Audino, for immense damage or an OHKO after Regigigas's Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Shadow Tag Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<p>Shadow Tag Regigigas is one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, as it can trap and eliminate frail offensive Pokemon including Mold Breaker Mega Diancie, No Guard Deoxys-S, and many variants of Mega Mewtwo Y. Its main source of damage is the combination of Fake Out and Extreme Speed, allowing Regigigas to often deal large amounts of damage without taking any in return. This combination of moves notably KOes Deoxys-S, offensive Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios with slight chip. Bullet Punch is used to OHKO Mega Diancie after a Shell Smash, as well as chip Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas. Spikes capitalizes on the free turns Regigigas gets against passive Wonder Guard users such as Mega Audino and Mega Scizor, as well as Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas lacking Glare, Dark Void, or Taunt. Regigigas is also often able to set 3 layers of Spikes vs passive Pokemon without Shed Shell, as they can not threaten it. Silk Scarf provides a boost to Regigigas's Normal-type STAB moves, allowing it to KO Deoxys-S, uninvested Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Latios with the combination of Fake Out and Extreme Speed. Additionally, Leftovers provides recovery that Regigigas can capitalize on by trapping passive Pokemon with Shadow Tag. Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Regigigas to hit as hard as possible, while an investment in HP increases Regigigas's longevity.</p> <p>Regigigas fits mostly on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to trap and remove powerful offensive threats. Frail Mold Breaker sweepers such as Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie pair well with Regigigas, as removing offensive Pokemon allows them to set up more easily. Additionally, these Mold Breaker users can force out the metagame's most common Magic Bounce user in Giratina, which would otherwise prevent Regigigas from setting entry hazards. Mold Breaker Tyranitar is able to force Regigigas out, so Fairy- and Dark-type teammates such as Mega Diancie are good to have. Common Wonder Guard Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Primal Kyogre are able to wall Regigigas, so the same Mold Breaker Pokemon also pair well with Regigigas, as they can eliminate these Pokemon. Imposter Chansey is another great partner, as the two of them can revenge almost all Pokemon except Mega Gengar and Dialga. Wonder Guard users also make good teammates, Regigigas is often able to remove the Mold Breaker Pokemon that threaten them. Pokemon with Trick, Mold Breaker Knock Off, or other forms of item removal are other helpful teammates, as Regigigas greatly appreciates Shed Shells being removed from opposing Wonder Guard users.</p>"

  "Giratina": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Baton Pass can be run on the first moveslot, as Giratina often incentivizes switching by threatening to use Encore; additionally, Baton Pass allows Giratina to switch out of Huge Power Pursuit users safely. Substitute is another option which allows Giratina to force attacks in tandem with Encore and scout against opposing Choice item Mold Breaker users in a 1v1 situation, but is generally not worth it as the opportunity cost of not running an additional utility move is very high. Toxic can be run to chip Mega Mewtwo X, Primal Groudon, and Wonder Guard Xerneas, but doesn't have Will-O-Wisp's ability to cripple most physical attackers or Glare's ability to hamper most Mold Breaker users' sweeping ability. Trick, especially with a detrimental item like Lagging Tail, allows Giratina to remove Plates from the many special Mold Breaker users, such as Mega Gengar, Mega Diancie, Dialga, and Mega Sceptile. As an alternative to Will-O-Wisp, Flame Orb + Psycho Shift prevents Dark Void from affecting Giratina and, in effect, spreads 100% accurate burns, but its downside includes Giratina needing to recover more frequently due to passive self-damage, forcing Giratina to cede momentum to the opponent. Dark Void is an option for the first moveslot which ignores Safety Goggles, at the cost of putting Giratina to sleep when used against a Magic Bounce user. Swagger can also be run in the first moveslot when paired with Imposter Chansey, as when Giratina is overwhelmed by a physical Mold Breaker user, it can use the move and either secure chip and heal itself or sack itself to bring Chansey in. Colbur Berry is an option that allows it to switch out of Huge Power Pursuit users one time without being as heavily damaged, though it is rather difficult to run due to the opportunity cost of not being able to block Spore, having passive recovery, or blocking Trick. Haze is an option over Encore that allows Giratina to check opposing Shell Smash sweepers in long games, as Encore is prone to getting PP stalled; however, this is only useful against physical Mold Breakers that Giratina naturally checks, like Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X.</p> <p>Aside from Prankster and Magic Bounce, Giratina can run niche abilities in Poison Heal and Fur Coat; Poison Heal Giratina can defensively check Primal Groudon and Choice Band Mega Rayquaza more effectively, while Fur Coat Giratina has much less difficulty switching into Huge Power users. Poison Heal sets run Will-O-Wisp, Psycho Shift, Scald, or Steam Eruption in the first moveslot, King's Shield or Spiky Shield in the second moveslot, Curse, and Recover, with Toxic Orb as the item. Fur Coat Giratina enjoys running a similar moveset, but it favors running the same items that Prankster Giratina runs; however, Fur Coat Giratina does not rely on King's Shield as much, and it cannot run Psycho Shift viably. However, these abilities are not without their weaknesses: Poison Heal Giratina cannot disrupt Shell Smash sweepers that it is weak to, such as Mega Gengar, Mega Diancie, Mega Tyranitar, and Dialga, the way Prankster Giratina would be able to, and Fur Coat Giratina is extremely passive and is generally outclassed by Prankster except against Huge Power users. No Guard Giratina is an extremely fringe option that exclusively relies on surprise, but a faster No Guard user, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Mewtwo X, or Mega Aerodactyl, is virtually always superior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Huge Power Dark-Types</strong>: Dark-type Huge Power users, like Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal, can force mindgames against Giratina through threatening both Pursuit and a conventional attack, usually Knock Off. However, Giratina can use Destiny Bond to force a trade between it and the Huge Power Dark-type, or run the niche Baton Pass to circumvent Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Specially Offensive Pokemon</strong>: The vast majority of special Mold Breaker users can threaten Giratina, as Giratina is virtually always physically defensive and has a poor typing to deal with opposing special attackers. However, many special Mold Breakers rely on Plates to have a powerful STAB move or coverage, and Giratina running Trick can render said Plate users null as a threat once their Plate is removed. Even when not taking Mold Breaker users into account, specially offensive Pokemon, such as Protean Mega Latios and Choice Specs Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza, force Giratina out.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir</strong>: Fairy-type Wonder Guard users with a respectable Special Attack stat, namely Xerneas and Mega Gardevoir, can force Giratina out with Moonblast; however, they must watch out for Glare, Will-O-Wisp, and Destiny Bond, as a loss of momentum, effectively being on a timer, or just being removed hampers the support they are able to give to the rest of the team.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry Mega Mewtwo X</strong>: If Giratina is not healthy, Mega Mewtwo X with a Lum Berry can overwhelm Giratina, though Destiny Bond Giratina can force a trade between itself and Mega Mewtwo X.</p> <p><strong>-ate Users</strong>: Refrigerate, Pixilate, and Aerilate (collectively called -ate) users can force Giratina out by threatening either Fake Out + Extreme Speed or an extremely powerful Boomburst. Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B can threaten a KO against Giratina with Fake Out into Extreme Speed; Mega Abomasnow and Mega Rayquaza can potentially play around Giratina variants with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>No Guard Users</strong>: By virtue of OHKOing every Pokemon that don't have Wonder Guard or Sturdy, No Guard users are adept at forcing Giratina out. However, Giratina can force a trade by using Destiny Bond on an OHKO move.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Prankster Giratina is the best blanket check to physical attackers in the metagame, as it is an untrappable check to Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X with amazing bulk and potentially an immunity to Trick. In addition, it has numerous possible options to try and circumvent its checks. Will-O-Wisp allows Giratina to cripple opposing Huge Power users without a Lum Berry and chips foes lacking recovery without resorting to Curse. Destiny Bond is also a great option, as it allows for a near-guaranteed trade, usually against a runaway sweeper. Spore annoys the likes of Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X lacking Safety Goggles, as well as Pokemon that would normally threaten Giratina like Mega Gengar, Mega Latios, and Mold Breaker Mega Diancie. Glare is another option that makes Primal Groudon and Huge Power users easier to deal with, but leaves Giratina vulnerable to Huge Power Pursuit users like Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal. Encore is integral to Giratina's ability to check sweepers, as locking opposing sweepers into setup moves like Shell Smash all but forces them out. Curse is extremely valuable, as many switch-ins to Giratina lack reliable recovery, and it is fairly easy for Giratina to find opportunities to heal itself. Recover is essential to Giratina's longevity. Safety Goggles is preferred, as it allows Giratina to be a sturdy check to Primal Groudon using Spore as disruption; Leftovers can be used to passively heal Giratina reduce chip damage from U-turn and entry hazards. Griseous Orb prevents Trick users, like Choice Band Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza, from locking Giratina into either a support move, preventing recovery until Giratina switches back in later in the game, or recovery, leaving Giratina a momentum sink.</p> <p>Giratina can fit on virtually any team, as the widespread utility it provides on top of checking offensive Pokemon is unmatched. It effectively acts as a switch-in for Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo X, and offensive Choice Band Mold Breaker users. Giratina forms a crucial part of the metagame's most dominant core in Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Wonder Guard Xerneas. Giratina can come in on Huge Power-boosted Poison- and Steel-type attacks, while Xerneas can support the rest of the team with utility, such as Stealth Rock, Defog, Aromatherapy, and Glare; Giratina can also Imposter-proof Primal Groudon sets not running Dark Void. Additionally, Giratina can potentially use Glare and allow for Primal Groudon to pose a greater threat, or Destiny Bond to remove checks to this core like Mega Gengar and Protean Mega Latios. Both of these threats dislike having to win 50-50s against Pursuit and Sucker Punch users; thus Huge Power Dark-types, in particular Mega Gyarados, are good partners to Giratina. Aside from Mega Gyarados, -ate users that can threaten opposing Primal Groudon, such as Mega Abomasnow and Mega Rayquaza, are also good partners, as Giratina has trouble reliably checking Dark Void variants. On more defensive teams, Magic Bounce users that complement Giratina well typing-wise, such as Yveltal, Registeel, and occasionally Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, work well. Because of Wonder Guard Xerneas's prevalence and it being a common switch-in to Giratina, Shadow Tag users, in particular Mega Mewtwo X, are great partners to Giratina.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Audino can run Knock Off to fully dismantle Mega Gengar, weaken opposing Mega Latios, and remove Prankster Giratina's Safety Goggles for offensive teammates running Spore. Whirlwind and Perish Song are options that can be used when threatening Mold Breaker sweepers like Primal Groudon try to switch into Mega Audino or when Wonder Guard users like Xerneas try to pass a Substitute to a teammate. This isn't as common because Mega Audino can either just predict a switch and pivot to Pokemon more suited to deal with sweepers, or it can be pressured by the Mold Breaker sweeper through continuous status infliction. U-turn is an alternative pivot move that can maintain momentum against Taunt users such as Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and slightly chip physically frail Mold Breaker users coming in, such as Mega Mewtwo Y. However, the loss of momentum against opposing Wonder Guard users usually isn't worth it. A Lum Berry can help Mega Audino heal from sleep or bad poison from Toxic Spikes, but its one-time use can prove inefficient. Wonder Guard is best for longevity, but Prankster and Magic Bounce give Mega Audino more flexibility to run support moves. OHKO moves can be useful as a shock factor to offensive threats and can OHKO opposing No Guard users, but they almost always aren't worth running due to being inconsistent. Mega Audino can also use hazards to punish opposing switch-ins. Lastly, Mega Audino can run a variety of other support moves like Glare, Chatter, and Will-O-Wisp to help advance its teammates further.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Unfavorable Matchup</strong>: Various Pokemon including Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X, Protean Mega Latios, Protean Mega Mewtwo Y, and Wonder Guard Xerneas often run super effective coverage moves against Mega Audino to force it out.</p> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: Giratina can be sent out against Mega Audino to run Curse against it, as Curse can be passed by Baton Pass. Additionally, a Giratina with Magic Bounce would not be able to let Mega Audino run Parting Shot in to escape and a Prankster Giratina can force Mega Audino out with Encore. However, Prankster Giratina must be careful when using Curse against Mega Audino with Parting Shot, as Mega Audino using the move the same turn Giratina uses Curse prevents Curse from affecting it, while Giratina is left less healthy.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Shell Smash Users</strong>: Mold Breaker users carrying Shell Smash can use Mega Audino's passivity to set up on it. They can also put Mega Audino to sleep with Spore or Dark Void—the former requires Safety Goggles to block more than once, while the latter cannot be consistently blocked by any item—or inflict chip damage with a powerful attack. However, some Mold Breaker users, such as Mega Gengar lacking a Poison-type STAB move, struggle to get past Mega Audino without getting lucky with sleep.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Perish Trappers</strong>: Mega Audino without Shed Shell is very vulnerable to removal by Shadow Tag users. If swapped in on any move bar Baton Pass or Parting Shot, the Shadow Tag user can Encore Mega Audino, set three layers of Spikes, and remove it with Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt shuts down all Mega Audino sets bar those using U-turn, Magic Coat, or non-status utility moves like Nuzzle and Knock Off.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Though it has an opportunity cost in not being able to be run with Wonder Guard Xerneas, Mega Audino is a premier Wonder Guard user in the Pure Hackmons metagame due to having an amazing defensive typing, being a very slow pivot, and being able to soft-check the likes of Mega Gengar lacking a Poison-type STAB move and Mega Latios lacking Shell Smash. Mega Audino can make use of either Recover to keep itself healthy or Wish with its high HP stat to keep both its teammates and itself healthy, though relying on Wish to heal makes it significantly more difficult to retain momentum. Aromatherapy and Defog are two of the best forms of support any defensive Wonder Guard user can offer its teammates. The former cures Mega Audino and its teammates of status ailments that they would otherwise be annoyed with, while the latter helps to minimize the amount of chip damage that offensive teammates take over the course of the game. King's Shield gives Mega Audino the chance to scout offensive Pokemon that like to switch into it, such as Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X and Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza, as well as allowing Mega Audino to force out many variants of said switch-ins after an Attack drop. Magic Coat helps Mega Audino's longevity by reflecting back status-inflicting moves like Spore, Dark Void, Will-O-Wisp, and Glare, as well as moves that would otherwise force Mega Audino out, like Taunt and Encore. A pivoting move is almost always required for Mega Audino to retain momentum for its team; Parting Shot is a solid option that can weaken offensive switch-ins, but it causes Mega Audino to struggle to maintain momentum against teams with a Magic Bounce user; however, Baton Pass is the preferred option due to its high PP and freedom pivoting. Mega Audino wants to be as physically bulky as possible in order to scout and pivot out of powerful physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Primal Groudon; a Relaxed nature with maximum HP and Defense investment and minimum Speed IVs help Mega Audino perform this function of a defensive cleric, soft-check specific Mold Breaker users, and act as a slow pivot. Shed Shell is the preferred item to prevent Mega Audino from being removed by Shadow Tag users, while Safety Goggles helps Mega Audino against Spore users like Mold Breaker users and Prankster Giratina.</p> <p>Mega Audino should only be used in rare semi-stall teams, bulky balance teams, and teams with enough offensive pressure to prefer the defensive roles Xerneas cannot perform as well in. Semi-stall is rare due to limits in teambuilding, but these teams can have Ho-Oh and Mega Steelix cover Mega Audino's weaknesses. Glass cannons, such as Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, Mold Breaker Mega Diancie, and Choice Band Mold Breaker Mega Rayquaza, appreciate Mega Audino's ability to bring them onto the field safely. In addition, these Pokemon also all appreciate Mega Audino's ability to clear entry hazards and cure status. Mega Audino also Imposter-proofs most offensive teammates lacking Poison-type and Steel-type moves, including Mold Breakers like Mega Rayquaza, Mega Latios, Dialga, and Mega Tyranitar. Mega Audino's vulnerability to Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and coverage attackers like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Latios in an unfavorable matchup makes -ate Speed users like Mega Rayquaza, Kyurem-B, and Mega Abomasnow valuable teammates. Notably, Mega Abomasnow is able to revenge kill the majority of Primal Groudon sets thanks to its resistance to Thousand Arrows, a powerful Boomburst, and Primal Groudon not being able to fit in a Fire-type STAB move and King's Shield on the same set. Mega Audino appreciates being part of most Wonder Guard cores. Cresselia, Mega Scizor, and Mega Manectric are all great examples of solid Wonder Guard partners, since Mega Audino compresses a lot of utility into one teamslot and carries distinct weaknesses. SubPass Wonder Guard users like Mega Swampert and Primal Groudon make for strong partners, since they appreciate the support Wish Mega Audino gives while providing the main support Mega Audino cannot offer. Offensive Shell Smash Wonder Guard sweepers like Mega Lucario and Primal Groudon also pair well with it. Finally, King's Shield Mega Audino can form a solid Wonder Guard core with Wonder Guard users weak to contact moves like Blissey and specially defensive Primal Kyogre.</p>"

  "Zekrom": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is also an option for Zekrom's first moveslot. It allows Zekrom to completely shut down most Giratina sets, which run four status moves. This forces Giratina to switch out and lets Zekrom use Shell Smash. However, it is less consistent than Dark Void, which lets Zekrom set up with ease. Shed Shell allows Zekrom to safely switch out against Shadow Tag users like Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X that threaten it with their super effective moves, as it gets trapped by Primal Groudon before Shell Smash and Mega Mewtwo X after a Shell Smash. However, using Shed Shell can reduce Zekrom's longevity or its power output without access to Leftovers or Draco Plate, respectively. Substitute can also be used with Leftovers. This helps matchups like Lum Berry Huge Power Mega Gyarados become more consistent, as Dark Void is not useful there.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Although Zekrom has several measures to prevent getting forced out by Giratina, it still poses a threat to Zekrom. It can use Encore on the turn Zekrom uses Shell Smash or King's Shield, forcing Zekrom to switch. Giratina can also use Destiny Bond to ensure a trade and get rid of Zekrom altogether.</p> <p><strong>Mega Audino</strong>: Wonder Guard Mega Audino is immune to any Dragon-type attacks Zekrom uses and can reliably tank Bolt Strike even after a Shell Smash if healthy. This discourages Zekrom from using a Dragon-type attack if the opponent wants to switch to Giratina. Mega Audino can also help pivot into a revenge killer or Encore Giratina to threaten Zekrom.</p> <p><strong>Ground- and Fairy-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Huge Power Mega Mewtwo-X with Thousand Arrows and Mega Mewtwo-Y and Protean Mega Latios with Moonblast can easily outspeed Zekrom and KO it with their super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster Primal Groudon sets, such as sets with Shadow Tag, and Mega Rayquaza also trouble Zekrom. They carry super effective moves such as Thousand Arrows on Primal Groudon and Draco Meteor on Choice Specs Mega Rayquaza that can easily KO it. Bulkier teammates help switch into some of these attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Strong priority moves from Pokemon like Pixilate Mega Diancie and Huge Power Regigigas, which can switch into any of Zekrom's unboosted moves, can threaten Zekrom, especially without King's Shield. Huge Power Mega Gyarados can also OHKO Zekrom with Sucker Punch after a Shell Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mold Breaker": {
        "description": "<p>Mold Breaker Zekrom is a powerful mixed sweeper with decent bulk and a nearly unresisted STAB combination, capable of OHKOing Giratina, Primal Groudon, and Wonder Guard Xerneas after a Shell Smash. King's Shield allows Zekrom to survive revenge killing attempts from moves like Pixilate Mega Diancie's Extreme Speed and Pure Power Mega Mewtwo X's Mach Punch if healthy. Leftovers increases Zekrom's longevity, taking advantage of the turns gained from forcing switches and sleep, as well as synergizing with King's Shield. Dark Void and Spore are useful to hinder Pokemon that would otherwise prevent Zekrom from using Shell Smash and gain turns to set up. The combination of Draco Plate and Judgment allows Zekrom to Imposter-proof itself with a strong, spammable Dragon-type STAB move that foes cannot take advantage of. Alternatively, Spacial Rend frees up Zekrom's item slot, though it is weaker than Draco Plate Judgment and makes Imposter-proofing Zekrom significantly more difficult. Lum Berry lets Zekrom use Shell Smash on an opposing Spore or Will-O-Wisp user switching in. 144 Atk EVs allow Zekrom to OHKO Xerneas at +2, and 56 Spe EVs let it outspeed Choice Scarf Primal Groudon after a Shell Smash.</p> <p>Substitute + Baton Pass users, like Wonder Guard Xerneas, Mega Scizor, and Primal Kyogre, work well with Zekrom, as they can safely bring Zekrom in, letting it use Shell Smash and potentially sweep. Slow pivots also help in a similar fashion, particularly Wonder Guard users, which are a valuable defensive backbone on almost any team. Shell Smash + Baton Pass users can also make for great partners in the same way. Safety Goggles Prankster Giratina, a very easy addition on almost any team, can also Imposter-proof Spore sets that run Judgment. Primal Groudon is an extremely good teammate, as it can act as a second Mold Breaker user that addresses revenge killers to Zekrom or as a Shadow Tag user that can trap and remove Pixilate Diancie or the uncommon Refrigerate Abomasnow and revenge kill weakened Imposter users copying Zekrom, unless Zekrom has King's Shield.</p>"

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kyurem-B can also opt to run a physical coverage move like Gunk Shot, Freeze-Dry, Close Combat, or Thousand Arrows to hit unsuspecting Wonder Guard users that would switch in to block its Ice-type STAB moves. Spikes, Toxic Spikes, or Sticky Web can replace Stealth Rock. Will-O-Wisp can also replace it to status and chip Wonder Guard users that switch in. A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs can be used on Boomburst sets to move slower than some Wonder Guard users' pivots. Kyurem-B can also run King's Shield because all of its main competitors (Regigigas, Slaking, Mega Diancie, and Mega Rayquaza) tend to outspeed it. It can then threaten to beat any of these one-on-one if they lack a King's Shield and Boomburst of their own.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wonder Guard</strong>: Because Kyurem-B usually forgoes running coverage, Wonder Guard Pokemon aren't afraid of it, and some can even set up in front of it. However, Kyurem-B sets running Gastro Acid can circumvent this to an extent, as once Wonder Guard is removed, most Wonder Guard users are forced out, granting the Kyurem-B user momentum.</p> <p><strong>Other Priority Users</strong>: In a one-on-one scenario, faster -ate Speed users, like Mega Diancie and Mega Rayquaza, are able to outspeed Kyurem and hit hard with Fake Out into Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>King's Shield + Mold Breaker Sweepers</strong>: Bulky Mold Breaker sweepers that run King's Shield, such as Primal Groudon, Mega Tyranitar, and Dialga, force Kyurem-B to play mind games every time they set up and Kyurem-B comes in. Primal Groudon is particularly threatening, as it has exceptional physical bulk for a Shell Smash sweeper and can run a sleep move and King's Shield on the same set viably.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Shadow Tag Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X can punish Kyurem-B heavily by surviving an Extreme Speed and attacking back with their strong attacks, like V-create and Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Magic Bounce Registeel and Mega Steelix have high Defense to absorb Kyurem-B's attacks with ease, removing any progress it makes with their recovery.</p>",

      "Refrigerate": {
        "description": "<p>Through its use of priority Ice-type STAB attacks, Refrigerate Kyurem-B acts as an effective revenge killer, sweep-stopper, and general offensive powerhouse. Fake Out + Extreme Speed can easily dispatch most No Guard users and Shell Smash sweepers lacking King's Shield, as well as chunking bulky Ice-weak support Pokemon like Giratina. Boomburst can be used to damage sweepers behind Substitute, as well as immediately threatening Magic Bounce Giratina and unboosted Primal Groudon. Pursuit gives Kyurem-B the option to punish physically frail foes, like Mega Gengar and Mega Latios, on a switch out. Sacred Fire is an option to threaten bulky Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Registeel, and Mega Steelix, which makes Stealth Rock easier to use in matchups against said foes. Stealth Rock itself is a great way to punish switches. Finally, Gastro Acid instead lets Kyurem-B force most Wonder Guard Pokemon out, escape offensive Shadow Tag users, and remove Mold Breaker from sweepers running King's Shield if it predicts correctly. Lum Berry is used to avoid sleep from Mold Breaker sweepers once and dodge other status if they aren't in play, while Icicle Plate buffs Kyurem-B's Ice-type moves and gives it the power to KO Giratina with Boomburst after Stealth Rock. On sets running Boomburst, a Naughty nature is preferred to avoid lowering Kyurem-B's Special Attack; otherwise, an Adamant nature is preferred. Maximum Defense investment allows it to survive one V-create or Thousand Arrows from boosted Primal Groudon at full.</p> <p>Kyurem-B fits best on offensive teams that appreciate it revenge killing frailer threats that outspeed its teammates. Kyurem-B's largest weakness is its inability to consistently damage Wonder Guard users because of its narrow coverage. Because of this, it benefits greatly from Mold Breaker teammates like Mega Gengar, Pokemon that use a wide variety of coverage moves like offensive Wonder Guard Xerneas, and Perish Song trappers like Lugia. Choice Scarf + No Guard Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y can help the matchup against Primal Groudon. Additionally, special attackers like the Mega Mewtwo Y or Mega Gengar can stop physical walls from walling Kyurem-B out. Finally, due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Defog support is needed to maximize its longevity when switching in to revenge kill.</p>"

  "Meloetta": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternate EV Spread of 248 HP / 28 Def / 232 SpD with a Calm nature maximizes Meloetta's special bulk while allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from Mold Breaker Mega Gengar's Secret Sword after Stealth Rock. 76 Speed EVs can be used outpace Huge Power Yveltal and escape its Pursuit, though doing so cuts into Meloetta's chance of surviving attacks from Mold Breaker users like Mega Gengar and usually isn't worth it due to Huge Power Yveltal's relative rarity. Colbur Berry is an option on physically defensive sets, allowing it to avoid the Pursuit trapper mind game once. Safety Goggles and Chesto Berry are options that can improve Meloetta's matchup against Mold Breaker users using Spore and Dark Void, respectively. Mail is a final option that makes Meloetta immune to Trick. All these options, however, leave Meloetta vulnerable to Shadow Tag users like Perish Song Lugia and Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X.</p> <p>Psystrike is a decent option that OHKOes Mega Gengar, even without investment, making it a much more reliable check—especially alongside Chesto Berry or Safety Goggles—though it has little utility outside of hitting Mega Gengar. Glare is another option that, like Whirlwind, makes Meloetta a situational check to some special Shell Smash Mold Breaker or Wonder Guard sweepers. Perish Song is an alternative to Whirlwind that fares better versus Magic Bounce Substitute + Baton Pass users like Giratina. Nuzzle and Chatter are niche options that can disrupt opposing sweepers and also make Meloetta less vulnerable to Taunt users. Steam Eruption is an option to OHKO standard Primal Groudon, but has little utility otherwise. Parting Shot and U-Turn are alternate pivoting options over Baton Pass. However, the former cedes momentum Magic Bounce users, the latter cedes momentum to Wonder Guard users, and, unlike Baton Pass, neither move evades a slower Pursuit. Finally, Magic Coat is an option to reflect sleep moves from Mold Breaker users, Stealth Rock from -ate Speed users, and Sing, Gastro Acid, Taunt, and Spider Web from No Guard users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Huge Power Pursuit</strong>: Despite King's Shield and Baton Pass mitigating Meloetta's weakness to Pursuit, it still has to be wary of being Pursuit trapped while paralyzed, when facing the uncommon but relevant Sticky Web, and when facing faster Pursuit users—particularly since Meloetta is often its team's cleric or entry hazard remover.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Shell Smash Mold Breakers like Primal Groudon, Mega Tyranitar, and Arceus set up safely on any Meloetta set not carrying Whirlwind or niche options like Glare or Chatter. In addition, if Meloetta forgoes King's Shield, it's also forced out by powerful physical attackers like Choice Band Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza.</p> <p><strong>Unfavorable Matchup</strong>: Like any Wonder Guard user, Meloetta is vulnerable to powerful Huge Power, Protean, and Parental Bond attackers carrying the right coverage moves—such as Beat Up Huge Power Mega Mewtwo X and Bug Buzz Protean Mega Latios.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Meloetta is vulnerable to Knock Off, which either removes its Shed Shell, leaving it vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, or KOes it outright.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Unless it's holding Mail, Trick users can hinder Meloetta for the entirety of the match, forcing it to either use Baton Pass or relinquish momentum.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: As is the case with the majority of support Wonder Guard users, Prankster Giratina can force Meloetta out with Encore and chip it with Will-O-Wisp and Curse. Additionally, Giratina's Glare can also leave Meloetta vulnerable to slower Pursuit users it would ordinarily evade.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt forces out nearly all Meloetta sets. Even those making use of niche options like Psystrike or Nuzzle become limited in their ability to maintain momentum and support their team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Meloetta's unique typing, good bulk, and flexible Speed tier make it a strong option for a support Wonder Guard user. Baton Pass allows Meloetta to provide pivoting support to its teammates while also escaping slower Pursuit users, such as Huge Power Mega Gyarados. King's Shield is an alternative that can similarly ease Meloetta's matchup versus Pursuit users while also letting it scout for its team and improving its one-on-one matchup versus powerful physical threats like Choice Band Mold Breaker Primal Groudon. Defog and Aromatherapy are valuable support options for nearly every team composition. However, if a teammate is carrying either or both, Meloetta can make use of other utility options like Whirlwind and Stealth Rock. Notably, Whirlwind can make Meloetta a situational check to many special Shell Smash Mold Breaker and Wonder Guard sweepers, as well as force out Substitute + Baton Pass users like the ever popular Wonder Guard Xerneas. Finally, recovery is essential for Meloetta to function effectively. Recover's immediacy and reliability is generally preferred, but Wish is an alternative that allows Meloetta to support its teammates and synergizes well with King's Shield and Baton Pass. Shed Shell is the preferred item, as it makes Meloetta much less susceptible to Shadow Tag users. The given EV spread maximizes Meloetta's physical bulk while also giving it the ability to survive Mold Breaker Mega Gengar's +2 Sludge Wave after Stealth Rock. This is notable, as Meloetta's immunity to Ghost and good bulk allow it to soft check Mold Breaker Mega Gengar whether it's carrying Secret Sword or Sludge Wave. Finally, if Pursuit trappers aren't a concern, Meloetta can make use of a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs to underspeed popular slow pivots like Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas.</p> <p>Like is the case with all support Wonder Guard users, Meloetta fits on a wide variety of team structures. Its weakness to Pursuit users means that Meloetta appreciates teammates such as Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas, as well as Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers like Mega Gardevoir and Mega Lucario. Choice Specs Mold Breaker users, such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Rayquaza, appreciate specially defensive Meloetta's ability to Imposter-proof them thanks to its unique typing and good special bulk. Choice Specs Mold Breaker Mega Mewtwo Y is worth noting in particular, as even physically defensive variants of Meloetta can Imposter-proof it with Whirlwind or by using Baton Pass to pivot to a revenge killer like Sucker Punch Mega Gyarados. Additionally, Pursuit trappers like Huge Power Mega Gyarados and Yveltal are excellent teammates for Meloetta, checking Shell Smash Mold Breakers users and Pursuit trapping Prankster Giratina. Furthermore, Pursuit users can trap Imposter users copying variants of Meloetta lacking Baton Pass. -ate Speed users like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Abomasnow are also helpful teammates for Meloetta, as they force out the majority of Mold Breaker sweepers after being brought in safely by Meloetta's Baton Pass. On bulkier teams, Meloetta can be run alongside another defensive Wonder Guard user, allowing for more flexibility with both their movesets. In particular, Wonder Guard users that can switch into physical attackers for Meloetta, but are perhaps more vulnerable to Mold Breaker Mega Gengar—such as Mega Scizor and Mega Swampert—synergize very well with Meloetta. Finally, offensive Shadow Tag users such as Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo X are valuable teammates as they can trap the Pursuit trappers that Meloetta fears.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe alongside a Naughty nature can be used to OHKO physically defensive Primal Kyogre with +2 Bolt Strike and standard Wonder Guard Xerneas with +2 Gear Grind while still OHKOing Bug / Steel type Wonder Guard users with Techno Blast. However, such a set is largely outclassed by Mega Lucario and Mega Scizor, of which the former has higher Speed, better overall damage output, and can OHKO Primal Groudon at +2 with its Fist Plate Judgment. Genesect has a few other viable coverage options available to it; Scald OHKOes most variants of Primal Groudon without needing to boost first, Aura Sphere hits Normal-type Wonder Guard users not named Blissey or Chansey harder than Secret Sword, Night Daze hits Wonder Guard Dusclops, Knock Off removes items and hits Psychic-type Wonder Guard users, and Giga Drain hits Water-type Wonder Guard users like Mega Swampert while also providing recovery. Finally, Flame Plate and Judgment are options over Burn Drive and Techno Blast if Judgment’s greater PP is valued more than the immunity to item removal that Burn Drive grants.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage</strong>: A quadruple weakness to Fire and below average bulk means that Genesect drops to even relatively weak Fire-type attacks. Furthermore, Sacred Fire, V-Create, Searing Shot, and Lava Plume are all very common coverage moves on Huge Power, Protean, Parental Bond, and opposing Shell Smash + Wonder Guard users.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Mold Breaker Users</strong>: A weakness to powerful Mold Breaker users like Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza isn't unique to Genesect. However, unlike other Wonder Guard + Shell Smash sweepers like Mega Gardevoir and Mega Lucario, Genesect's comparatively low Special Attack means that it cannot OHKO many Mold Breaker users even after a Shell Smash depending on its coverage moves, leaving it vulnerable to being OHKOed in return.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Wonder Guard</strong>: Wonder Guard sweepers are inherently matchup dependent, so Wonder Guard users Genesect's coverage can’t touch will force it out.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Genesect's relatively low Special Attack for a Wonder Guard + Shell Smash sweeper means that Giratina can easily switch in and force an unboosted Genesect out. In particular, Haze variants of Giratina can wall Genesect almost endlessly, barring an unlucky freeze from Freeze-Dry. Once Genesect is neutralized with Encore or Haze, Giratina can also chip it with Will-O-Wisp or remove its sweeping potential with Glare.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Genesect's lack of a Shed Shell leaves it vulnerable to offensive Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Mewtwo X, and Primal Groudon. However, they cannot consistently check a boosted Genesect depending on its coverage moves; +2 Bug Buzz OHKOes Mega Mewtwo Y, +2 Moonblast OHKOes Mega Mewtwo X, and +2 Earth Power OHKOes Primal Groudon.</p>",

      "Shell Smash Wonder Guard": {
        "description": "<p>Genesect's good Special Attack, solid Bug / Steel typing, and unique interaction with Burn Drive make it a decent option for a Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweeper. Techno Blast and Burn Drive allow Genesect to both Imposter-proof itself and OHKO opposing Bug / Steel Wonder Guard users. Additionally, Burn Drive grants Genesect an immunity to Trick without sacrificing its ability to beat Imposter users—a property that only Fist Plate Arceus shares among Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers. The remaining two moveslots are devoted to coverage moves to hit as many Wonder Guard users as possible. Flash Cannon is a decently powerful Steel-type STAB that hits Xerneas, Mega Audino, and Mega Gardevoir. Earth Power hits Mega Manectric and Mega Lucario, in addition to OHKOing Primal Groudon at +2. Secret Sword hits Normal-type Wonder Guard users like Slaking and Blissey. Freeze-Dry hits Water-type Wonder Guard users like Primal Kyogre and Gyarados, as well as 2HKOes standard Giratina at +2. Grass Knot similarly hits Water-type Wonder Guard users, excluding Gyarados, but its situationally higher Base Power improves its matchup versus foes like Whirlwind Kyogre. Moonblast has good neutral coverage and at +2 OHKOes Wonder Guard Mega Sableye and Mega Mewtwo X and 2HKOes Giratina. Bug Buzz is another STAB option that allows Genesect to break through Psychic-type Wonder Guard users like Mega Mewtwo Y, Cresselia, Meloetta, and Deoxys-S—notably bypassing Substitute + Baton Pass Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-S's Substitutes. Alternatively, Genesect can make use of Gastro Acid to break through any Wonder Guard user that can't immediately KO it or force it out with Whirlwind. However, Gastro Acid essentially restricts Genesect's final coverage option to either Freeze-Dry or Moonblast, else it is unable to break through Prankster Giratina.</p> <p>Genesect fits best on balance and offense teams as a late-game wincon. Offensive Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y make excellent teammates for their ability to trap and KO opposing Wonder Guard users that frequently forgo Shed Shell, such as Xerneas, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Manectric. Choice item Mold Breaker users like Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza also make excellent teammates for their ability to blow holes in opposing Wonder Guard cores. In particular, Choice Band Primal Groudon is notable for its ability to essentially delete the majority of opposing Wonder Guard users with its STAB V-create. No Guard users such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Aerodactyl are helpful teammates, (comma) as they provide Genesect with an abundance of free turns to use Shell Smash, in addition to forcing out Prankster Giratina. Similarly, Huge Power Pursuit users are valuable teammates for their ability to Pursuit trap Prankster Giratina, as well as the Choice item Shadow Tag users that like to switch into Genesect. Refrigerate and Pixilate users like Mega Abomasnow and Mega Diancie are likewise noteworthy teammates for their ability to force out Giratina with their powerful Boomburst. In particular, Mega Abomasnow is notable for its ability to revenge kill many variants of Primal Groudon, which most Genesect sets struggle against even while boosted. Furthermore, -ate Speed users make excellent entry hazard setters, and Genesect appreciates entry hazard support to turn some of its favorable rolls, such as +2 Grass Knot versus physically defensive Kyogre, into guaranteed KOs, improving its overall effectiveness as a wincon. Finally, Aromatherapy, Defog, and Wish support from defensive Wonder Guard teammates is greatly appreciated to offset any chip damage or status conditions Genesect might acquire during a game, easing its job as a late-game cleaner.</p>"

  "Xerneas": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas has many options for its first moveslot. Shell Smash lets it pass boosts to a threatening teammate and can be run with a spread of 248 HP / 184 SpA / 76 Spe and a Modest nature to let it outspeed non-Choice Scarf Deoxys-S at +2. Defog and Aromatherapy are also decent support options, and Spikes can be used over Stealth Rock, as two of the most prominent Spikes-immune Pokemon, Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal, lose to Xerneas. Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web provide great support for a team as well, although Poison-types like Mega Gengar, Skuntank, and Drapion can absorb Toxic Spikes. Steam Eruption OHKOes Primal Groudon, though it doesn't threaten much else; if Xerneas runs Steam Eruption, an alternative spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 184 Spe with a Modest nature lets it outspeed Adamant Primal Groudon. Wish is an option over Recover, but it makes Xerneas healing itself safely more difficult. King's Shield forces out Choice Band Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza. Spore is usable over Dark Void because it has higher accuracy and gives Xerneas an easier time against Magic Bounce and Imposter users if it opts to run Safety Goggles, but Spore similarly doesn't affect foes with Safety Goggles. Knock Off is a fringe option that potentially removes Leftovers or Lum Berry from Primal Groudon and threatens Plate users like Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, Mega Diancie, and Dialga if Xerneas has a Substitute up. Magic Coat burns Prankster Giratina's Encore PP and bounces back Whirlwind but faces stiff competition from Taunt. Gastro Acid can be used to suppress Mold Breaker users' abilities on the switch, giving Xerneas a free turn to set up Substitute in most instances. Mail can prevent Trick users from crippling Xerneas, but Mail sets are generally forced into running Recover in the first moveslot.</p> <p>Mold Breaker Xerneas can effectively make use of Dark Void or Taunt over Spore on sets with Pixie Plate Judgment as its only attack. However, these moves invalidate Safety Goggles users and slow, passive Pokemon as methods of Imposter-proofing Xerneas. Xerneas can run Earth Power over Steam Eruption for the occasional Mega Metagross, Registeel, and Mega Steelix, though it doesn't OHKO Primal Groudon when unboosted. Secret Sword OHKOes Blissey when unboosted and 2HKOes Eviolite Chansey and Registeel at +2—all of which can switch into Mold Breaker Xerneas and phaze it or deprive it of its Pixie Plate with Knock Off. Recover and Substitute are alternatives to King's Shield that similarly augment Xerneas's survivability; the former allows Mold Breaker Xerneas to potentially set up multiple times during a game, while the latter protects Xerneas from revenge killers. Entry hazards are decent options on single-attack sets. Utilizing Moonblast over Pixie Plate Judgment allows Xerneas to make use of items like Leftovers, Lum Berry, Mental Herb, Shed Shell, and Safety Goggles; however, the loss in power is noticeable and forgoing Judgment makes Xerneas more difficult to Imposter-proof.</p> <p>Wonder Guard sweeper Xerneas can run Thousand Arrows to hit Air Balloon Wonder Guard users; Searing Shot to guarantee an OHKO on Aegislash at +2, which Lava Plume fails to do; Steam Eruption to deal more damage than Scald to Steel-resistant, non-Wonder Guard targets, such as Mega Metagross and Aegislash; Quiver Dance to improve the matchup against Mold Breaker users such as Mega Rayquaza; and Spore or Dark Void to safely set up on a sleeping foe. Xerneas can run other coverage moves depending on the team's needs.</p> <p>On teams running several Xerneas, Xerneas can run more unconventional and generally outclassed sets like Huge Power, Prankster, No Guard, Magic Bounce, and Imposter to take advantage of the surprise factor these teams provide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, especially if it is holding Leftovers, can force Xerneas out with relative ease because of its resistance to Moonblast and offensive presence. However, Xerneas running Glare or Dark Void can debilitate non-Lum Berry Primal Groudon, the rare Scald and Steam Eruption OHKO it unboosted, Earth Power OHKOes it at +2, and Gastro Acid nullifies its ability to bypass Wonder Guard.</p> <p><strong>Choice Item Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Choice item Mold Breaker Pokemon, especially ones with powerful STAB moves, like Primal Groudon, Mega Rayquaza, and Mega Mewtwo Y, can force Xerneas out. However, they can usually only come in when safely pivoted in, as most must be wary of Xerneas's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Shadow Tag users can trap non-Shed Shell Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas and eliminate it. Bulky Perish Song trappers, like Lugia and Arceus, can set up three layers of Spikes and remove Xerneas if pivoted in when it uses any move but Glare, Dark Void, or Baton Pass. Offensive Shadow Tag users—notably Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X—can KO Xerneas with coverage moves like Gunk Shot, Gear Grind, and Sludge Wave. However, they require pivoting support to get in safely against sets running Glare or Dark Void, often only secure a KO against Xerneas users that play carelessly, and require considerable support to threaten Shed Shell Xerneas.</p> <p><strong>Item Manipulation</strong>: Trick users—especially Pokemon Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas ordinarily switches into, like No Guard users, Wonder Guard Mega Beedrill, and rare Choice item Wonder Guard users—can severely hinder its ability to support its team by giving it a detrimental item. Choice items virtually force Xerneas into using Baton Pass, as its team loses momentum if it uses any other move, and Black Sludge effectively puts it on a timer. However, rare Mail variants of Xerneas are immune to Trick. Non-Moonblast Mold Breaker Xerneas relies on its Pixie Plate to deal decent damage, and Wonder Guard sweeper Xerneas relies on its Iron Plate to Imposter-proof itself and hit Fairy-type Wonder Guard users, so removing either via Trick or Knock Off is also severely debilitating.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Users</strong>: Without super effective coverage, Taunt, or Gastro Acid, Wonder Guard sweeper Xerneas is unable to touch Wonder Guard users. Whirlwind Wonder Guard users, such as Primal Kyogre, Slaking, and Cresselia, can also phaze Xerneas, disrupting its Substitute-passing or setup attempts. Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas can somewhat circumvent this with Glare, however, as it can pass a Substitute if the foe gets fully paralyzed for one turn, and Wonder Guard sweeper Xerneas can prevent Whirlwind with Taunt. Additionally, three of the best Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweepers, Xerneas, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Lucario, virtually always run coverage for Fairy-type Wonder Guard users like Xerneas and Mega Audino. However, Xerneas with Glare can survive a hit and debilitate the opposing Wonder Guard Shell Smash user with paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users Not Weak To Moonblast</strong>: While fairly rare, Moonblast-resistant Magic Bounce users, such as Registeel, Mega Steelix, and Mega Venusaur, can prevent most Xerneas from supporting its team through any means other than passing a Substitute. However, these Magic Bounce users are generally setup bait for Shell Smash Xerneas unless they run Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Move Users</strong>: If Huge Power, Protean, or rare Parental Bond users are carrying coverage to hit Xerneas, careful play must be accomplished to bring either Prankster Giratina or a powerful revenge killer, such as Sucker Punch Mega Gyarados, in and force the offensive Pokemon out. While rare, No Guard foes running Steel- or Poison-type coverage moves necessitate extremely offensive play by revenge killers and Mold Breaker users to have a chance at winning before the opponent does.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Extremely specially bulky Pokemon like Blissey, Eviolite Chansey, Registeel, and the rare RegenVest Primal Kyogre can stomach boosted Judgment from Mold Breaker Xerneas and phaze it or remove its Pixie Plate. Niche Toxic Orb Poison Heal variants of such Pokemon cause even more problems for Mold Breaker Xerneas, as it can't even break past them with sleep luck. In particular, Toxic Orb Magic Guard Ho-Oh is the most effective check to Mold Breaker Xerneas that forgo Steam Eruption, having ample time to force Xerneas out with Whirlwind or Perish Song. Although extremely niche, Mega Venusaur can similarly put a stop to all but rare Fire-type coverage sets thanks to its good bulk, resistances to both Fairy and Water, and immunity to Spore.</p> <p><strong>Plate Imposter Users</strong>: Though extremely niche, Iron Plate, Spooky Plate, and Pixie Plate Imposter users directly counter the most common methods of Imposter-proofing Judgment Xerneas.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Giratina</strong>: Although Giratina must be wary of Moonblast and Taunt, Wonder Guard sweeper Xerneas's other attacks at most 3HKO it, and it can use Encore to punish Xerneas for setting up. While much risker, it can similarly use Encore to lock Mold Breaker Xerneas into a predicted Shell Smash or halt its sweep with Spore, Glare, or Destiny Bond.</p>",

      "Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard": {
        "description": "<p>Wonder Guard Xerneas is the most threatening and versatile Wonder Guard user in the metagame thanks to its great defensive and offensive typing, respectable offensive stats, and versatile Speed tier. The first moveslot is extremely customizable, as Xerneas's offensive typing forces out most Magic Bounce users. Stealth Rock provides a way to chip opposing switch-ins, while Glare often nets free turns and can make Shell Smash sweepers more manageable by sharply reducing their Speed. While Recover faces stiff competition from the aforementioned two moves and isn't as easy to justify on Leftovers variants, it is nevertheless an excellent option on Shed Shell sets due to greatly increasing Xerneas's longevity. Taunt prevents Wonder Guard users from phasing Xerneas with Whirlwind and Prankster users from preventing Xerneas from passing Substitutes to teammates; Dark Void generates even more free turns than Glare does, although it's not as accurate and a well-timed Magic Bounce switch in puts Xerneas to sleep instead. Substitute, in tandem with Baton Pass, almost always allows Mold Breaker teammates one extra turn to safely set up, disrupt its check, or heavily damage opposing switch-ins. Baton Pass in itself is also a fantastic option, as Xerneas's offensive presence forces a wide variety of metagame threats out, often generating momentum for its team. Moonblast sets Xerneas apart from most other Wonder Guard users, as it's an amazing STAB option that threatens Giratina, Mega Rayquaza, Mega Mewtwo X lacking coverage for Xerneas, and weakened Mega Latios, allowing Xerneas to force opposing Wonder Guard users in in a wide variety of situations. Leftovers is generally preferred to allow for passive recovery on Xerneas and synergizes well with Substitute; Shed Shell can be run on Recover sets, however, as it prevents Xerneas from being easily removed by offensive Shadow Tag users. The given spread maximizes Xerneas's bulk, as well as Substitute's HP amount, while also forcing Pokemon weak to Fairy-type attacks out, such as Prankster Giratina, Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Rayquaza; minimum Speed maximizes Baton Pass's effectiveness, as pivoting after the opposing Pokemon moves ensures that the user's switch-in comes in safely.</p> <p>Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas works best on balance and bulky offense builds with teammates that appreciate being passed a Substitute, as well as defensive teammates that take care of what threatens Xerneas. In particular, the ubiquitous Primal Groudon + Giratina + Wonder Guard Xerneas core works extremely well, as Xerneas can pass Substitutes to Primal Groudon, Primal Groudon forces opposing Giratina in, and Giratina comes in on Huge Power-boosted Poison- and Steel-type attacks while simultaneously Imposter-proofing most Primal Groudon sets. Special Mold Breaker users, especially physically frailer ones like Mega Gengar, Mega Latios, Mega Diancie, and Mega Sceptile, also appreciate Substitute + Baton Pass support from Xerneas. Additionally, Xerneas also fits well on dual Mega Mewtwo X teams, as Mega Mewtwo X dislikes having to risk taking damage from Sucker Punch Mega Gyarados, being chipped by Shadow Tag Slaking and Regigigas, and, on sets lacking Lum Berry, getting burned by Prankster Giratina. Xerneas's most common switch-in in Primal Groudon can be taken advantage of by running defensive checks such as Prankster Giratina or the rare Mega Slowbro, offensive checks like Huge Power Mega Gyarados, or soft-checks that are also good support options like physically defensive Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre. Good revenge-killers to Primal Groudon, such as the aforementioned Mega Gyarados, Imposter Chansey, and Refrigerate Mega Abomasnow, also excel as partners to Xerneas. Mega Gyarados also doubles as a check to the most prevalent Shadow Tag Perish trapper in Lugia. Lastly, No Guard users, which often force opposing Wonder Guard users in, are great partners to Xerneas, as most of the time they provide fodder for Xerneas to use Substitute. Last but not least, Xerneas can be paired with other Xerneas in spam teams if running Recover on the first moveslot, with possible abilities on teammates being Mold Breaker, Huge Power, Pixilate, No Guard, and Prankster.</p>"

      "Mold Breaker Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Excellent overall stats and a stellar typing both offensively and defensively make Mold Breaker Xerneas a powerful and resilient sweeper. Additionally, Xerneas's good bulk sets it apart from other Fairy-type Mold Breaker users like Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir—whose frailty prevents them from effectively making use of defensive options like King's Shield and Recover. Pixie Plate makes Judgment into a powerful STAB attack, OHKOing targets like standard Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock and all variants of Mega Rayquaza. After Shell Smash, Judgment also OHKOes Mega Gengar after Stealth Rock, always OHKOes bulky Dialga, and has a high chance to OHKO Wonder Guard Xerneas—guaranteed after Stealth Rock. Additionally, +0 Judgment 2HKOes physically defensive Prankster Giratina. King's Shield makes Xerneas much more resilient versus most common revenge killers—namely -ate Speed users like Mega Abomasnow—as well as forcing out offensive Shadow Tag users like Regigigas and Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X. Alternatively, Steam Eruption OHKOes Primal Groudon and Mega Diancie and gives Xerneas very good neutral coverage, with only extremely specially bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Primal Kyogre able to switch in safely after a Shell Smash. Steam Eruption also allows Xerneas to beat Magic Guard + Toxic Orb Ho-Oh, a niche set that is otherwise very difficult for Xerneas to break. Spore gives Xerneas free turns to set up and is preferred over other disruption moves like Dark Void and Taunt, as alongside Pixie Plate Judgment, it makes Xerneas extremely easy to Imposter-proof with a Safety Goggles Ghost-type teammate like Giratina. However, when supported by teammates like No Guard users and Substitute + Baton Pass users, Xerneas has an easier time setting up without Spore. Consequently, a set with both Steam Eruption for coverage and King's Shield for survivability is viable. The given EV Spread outpaces maximum Speed Adamant Primal Groudon. Alternatively, an EV spread of 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe can be used to maximize overall bulk while still outpacing Deoxys-S after a Shell Smash.</p> <p>Mold Breaker Xerneas fits best on balance and bulky offense teams as a late-game wincon. Prankster Giratina is perhaps Xerneas's most notable partner; it provides invaluable counterplay versus opposing Shell Smash sweepers like Primal Groudon and is a blanket check to the many powerful physical attackers of the metagame. More importantly, however, is that Prankster Giratina provides a rock-solid answer to Imposter users impersonating Xerneas, thanks to its Ghost-typing blocking Normal-type Judgement and Safety Goggles blocking Spore. Xerneas appreciates a secondary Mold Breaker teammate, as it is unable to adequately pressure most Wonder Guard Pokemon before a boost. Choice Band Mold Breaker Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza are particularly notable teammates, as they pressure most of Xerneas's defensive checks, such as Blissey and Ho-Oh. Huge Power Mega Gyarados, Choice Scarf Imposter Chansey, and Refrigerate Mega Abomasnow are also all excellent teammates for their ability to revenge kill a wide variety of threats, but especially Primal Groudon. Xerneas also appreciates teammates that give it opportunities to set up, such as Substitute + Baton Pass users like Mega Manectric, Mega Swampert, and Wonder Guard Xerneas, as well as No Guard teammates like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Aerodactyl. Shadow Tag users like Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X and Choice Scarf Primal Groudon are also excellent teammates for their ability to trap and KO Xerneas's checks, especially opposing Primal Groudon. Xerneas sets using Pixie Plate Judgment as their sole attack especially appreciate Shadow Tag users's ability to clear the way for its sweep. Finally, support Wonder Guard users are essential teammates for Xerneas, keeping the field clear of hazards and their team free of status. Additionally, because Xerneas usually lacks recovery, those same teammates can provide it with valuable Wish support, extending its survivability throughout longer games.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Xerneas's solid Special Attack, adequate Speed, good bulk, and excellent typing make it an effective Wonder Guard Shell Smash sweeper. Wonder Guard in tandem with Iron Plate Judgment makes Xerneas Imposter-proof and immune to most forms of revenge killing; coverage moves mostly make up for the lack of Mold Breaker by hitting opposing Wonder Guard users super effectively. Iron Plate Judgment also lets Xerneas easily beat Fairy-type Wonder Guard users such as Mega Audino and opposing Xerneas. Freeze-Dry hits Water-type Wonder Guard users like Primal Kyogre, Mega Swampert, and Gyarados and 3HKOes Mega Gyarados. Moonblast OHKOes Mega Mewtwo X with slight chip damage, OHKOes Giratina and Mega Gyarados at +2, and hits Wonder Guard Mega Sableye. Secret Sword hits Wonder Guard Blissey, Slaking, and Arceus. Gastro Acid's ability suppression potentially allows Xerneas to beat Wonder Guard users it lacks coverage for and makes it immune to Mold Breaker users' non-super effective attacks. Taunt shuts down slower Wonder Guard users, preventing them from pivoting around Xerneas, preventing them from phazing it, and possibly forcing them to switch out. Lava Plume hits Wonder Guard users such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Scizor, as well as the occasional Aegislash and Mega Metagross. Earth Power also threatens the latter two, OHKOes Primal Groudon at +2, and hits Wonder Guard users such as Mega Manectric and Drapion. Scald OHKOes Primal Groudon without any setup, which is especially useful for removing Mold Breaker variants before they hit Xerneas through Wonder Guard, and it hits niche Wonder Guard users like Volcarona and Ho-Oh. Bug Buzz hits Wonder Guard users such as Cresselia, Deoxys-A, and Mega Mewtwo Y. 76 Speed EVs let Xerneas outspeed Deoxys-S after Shell Smash.</p> <p>Wonder Guard sweeper Xerneas is an effective wincon for balance, bulky offense, and offense teams. Huge Power Mega Gyarados can Pursuit trap Prankster Giratina, which Xerneas has trouble with if it lacks Moonblast. Xerneas is unable to handle No Guard users on its own, so pair it with a second Wonder Guard user—one that does not share its weaknesses—or a revenge killer, such as Shadow Tag Slaking or Pixilate Mega Diancie. Bulky Wonder Guard users, such as Primal Kyogre and Blissey, can also provide Xerneas with Wish recovery. Moreover, Prankster Giratina, revenge killers, and bulky Wonder Guard users can beat fast and strong Mold Breaker users such as Mega Rayquaza, Primal Groudon, and Mega Gengar, which give Xerneas a hard time safely setting up. Mold Breaker, Shadow Tag, Huge Power, and Protean users, such as Primal Groudon, Mega Mewto Y, Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Latios, can KO Wonder Guard users Xerneas lacks coverage for so it may clean up; Choice Band + Mold Breaker Primal Groudon notably OHKOes Wonder Guard Blissey and Mega Beedrill with Pursuit.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alternative status moves, such as Spore and Encore, are options for Prankster Yveltal. Beat Up is another option on most Yveltal sets that can hit past Substitute and isn't detrimental into King's Shield, but it is more unreliable than Knock Off because of the reliance on Yveltal's team members. Foul Play can be used over Pursuit on Magic Bounce and Prankster sets to better threaten offensive foes such as Mega Latios and Mega Mewtwo X; however, Prankster Giratina comfortably walls Yveltal if it is its strongest Dark-type STAB move and bulkier foes, like Primal Groudon and Xerneas, need to have used Shell Smash for it to deal significant damage. King's Shield in conjunction with Wish can be used to help both Yveltal and its teammates recover HP and help against physical Shadow Tag users; however, this takes up two moveslots. An alternative stat spread of 248 HP / 108 Def / 152 SpD with a Sassy or Careful nature can be run on Yveltal with an ability like Magic Bounce, Prankster, or Poison Heal to survive attacks like Thousand Arrows from +2 Primal Groudon and Dragon Ascent from Choice Band Mega Rayquaza. Coverage moves such as Close Combat, Sacred Fire, and Gear Grind can be used on Huge Power sets to hit Wonder Guard Pokemon such as Slaking, Mega Scizor, and Xerneas, respectively. RegenVest and Gale Wings Yveltal can more easily sponge special hits and provide priority that doesn't trigger the attack drop from King's Shield, respectively. Huge Power Yveltal can run Water Shuriken to revenge kill Primal Groudon, though Huge Power Mega Gyarados hits Primal Groudon significantly harder. Expert Belt can be used for extra damage against Xerneas with Iron Head or Cresselia with Pursuit. Life Orb is the last alternative if Yveltal wants a boost to all of its attacks with the drawback of recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Priority Users</strong>: Pixilate and Refrigerate users such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B OHKO Yveltal with Extreme Speed, and Mega Rayquaza 2HKOes it with the same move. Because they force Yveltal out, it is also unable to block entry hazards, which are frequently used on -ate users. Additionally, Huge Power Regigigas and Gale Wings Mega Rayquaza threaten Yveltal; the former is especially threatening if Yveltal forgoes King's Shield. However, Yveltal can usually comfortably switch out of these matchups because of its resistance to Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>No Guard Users</strong>: No Guard users can threaten Yveltal with Sheer Cold. Additionally, some No Guard users survive a Sucker Punch from non-Huge Power Yveltal sets.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Sweepers</strong>: Wonder Guard sweepers, such as Mega Gardevoir and Xerneas, can threaten most Yveltal sets because of their immunity to Yveltal's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Coverage</strong>: Huge Power Pokemon, such as Mega Mewtwo X, can OHKO Yveltal with super effective attacks, especially if it does not run King's Shield. Protean Mega Latios and Mega Mewtwo Y can also threaten Yveltal with coverage like Moonblast and Freeze-Dry. However, these Pokemon are vulnerable to Huge Power Yveltal's Sucker Punch, though Yveltal needs Dread Plate to OHKO uninvested Mega Mewtwo X with it.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard</strong>: Wonder Guard users not weak to Dark- or Flying-type moves are free to do whatever they wish against most Yveltal sets. However, Mold Breaker Yveltal can still remove items with Knock Off and Huge Power Yveltal can threaten non-Ghost-type Wonder Guard users initially neutral to Dark with Trick-or-Treat into Knock Off or Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Setup Mold Breaker users can put Yveltal to sleep with Dark Void to gain turns to set up with Shell Smash. Choice item Mold Breaker users are also a threat to Yveltal, but they dislike taking Sucker Punch from Huge Power Yveltal variants as well as Prankster Yveltal carrying Destiny Bond or Spore.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: If Yveltal does not run Shed Shell, it is susceptible to being trapped and KOed by attackers like Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X, or it can be taken out by Encore + Perish Song users, like Lugia and Arceus.</p> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Being given a Choice item via Trick severely debilitates Yveltal, as this forces it to either use a recovery move and risk being too passive or respond with a different move and risk being worn down and subsequently KOed.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status severely cripples Yveltal, especially if it isn't running Lum Berry. However, Magic Bounce Yveltal can only be statused by Mold Breaker users.</p>",

Knock Off hits Pokemon like Giratina. Aromatherapy can be used to free a moveslot on passive Wonder Guard teammates, and Yveltal is an effective user of the move because of blocking Taunt via Magic Bounce. Pursuit traps Ghost-type Pokemon, particularly Mega Gengar. Sucker Punch can be used to pick off foes like Mold Breaker Mega Gengar, Mold Breaker Mega Latios after a Shell Smash, and chipped No Guard Deoxys-S. Baton Pass and Wish can be used in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy to slowly pivot to a teammate for them to safely receive Wish. King's Shield allows Yveltal to scout Choice item Mold Breaker users and weaken most offensive Shadow Tag users, like V-create Primal Groudon and Low Kick Mega Mewtwo X, though it leaves Yveltal vulnerable to Trick. Shed Shell allows Yveltal to escape Shadow Tag, users like Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X. However, Safety Goggles can also be used to better check Mold Breaker Spore users vulnerable to Yveltal, such as Mega Gengar. Run a Careful nature of 31 Speed IVs if Yveltal is not running Baton Pass.</p> <p>Magic Bounce Yveltal can be used on stall or bulky balance teams that struggle with Mold Breaker Mega Gengar and Mega Latios and need a status blocker for longevity. Yveltal also functions well on already well-rounded teams, as Yveltal is passive and only soft checks most of what it switches into. Yveltal has great defensive synergy with Prankster Giratina, as Yveltal checks non-No Guard Mega Gengar and Mold Breaker Mega Latios for it. Mold Breaker teammates, like Mega Latios and Primal Groudon, appreciate Yveltal's ability to slowly pivot to them with Baton Pass and block status moves, like Spore and Will-O-Wisp from Prankster foes, like Giratina. Mega Latios in particular can also be Imposter-proofed to a degree by Safety Goggles Yveltal. Substitute + Baton Pass users, like Xerneas and Wonder Guard Mega Gengar, appreciate Yveltal's ability to block Taunt; Yveltal can also Imposter-proof Mega Gengar in particular effectively because of the former bouncing back Toxic Spikes.

Trick-or-Treat can be used against Wonder Guard Pokemon that originally take neutral damage from Yveltal's attacks, such as Primal Kyogre and Blissey. Alternatively, Gastro Acid can be used against Wonder Guard Pokemon that resist Yveltal's STAB attacks, like Mega Lucario and Xerneas, though running it means Yveltal fails to OHKO some Wonder Guard users, like Primal Kyogre and weakened Slaking, with Pursuit after making them vulnerable. Pursuit is used against Mold Breaker Shell Smash sweepers trying to switch out like Primal Groudon and Mega Latios, as well as Wonder Guard Pokemon that have been hit with a Trick-or-Treat or a Gastro Acid. Sucker Punch is ideal against Choice item Pokemon weak to Dark-type attacks like Mega Latios and Mega Mewtwo Y, Shell Smash-boosted Mold Breaker Pokemon, and chipped Mega Mewtwo X and Deoxys-A. Knock Off can be used with Gastro Acid to remove items such as Shed Shell from Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre and Slaking, while Iron Head is an option to hit Pokemon such as Wonder Guard Xerneas and Mega Audino for super effective damage. Dread Plate is the main item because of it boosting Yveltal's Dark-type STAB moves; however, Lum Berry can be used against Shell Smash sweepers running Spore.</p> <p>Huge Power Yveltal best fits on bulky offense and balance teams that require a revenge killer and Pursuit trapper against Mold Breaker sweepers like Mega Gengar and Mega Latios. Giratina is also weak to Yveltal if it is running Lum Berry, as it can absorb a Spore and hit it with either Pursuit or Knock Off. -Ate users such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B can OHKO it with Pixilate- or Refrigerate- boosted Extreme Speed, and Yveltal cannot use Sucker Punch to damage them. Additionally, Yveltal is susceptible to status from the likes of Prankster Giratina if it isn't running Lum Berry, so Magic Bounce users like Yveltal and Giratina are very useful. Mold Breaker Pokemon are useful teammates for Yveltal if it cannot damage some Wonder Guard users like Xerneas and Mega Sableye.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pixilate Mega Diancie can make use of 96 Speed EVs alongside a Naughty nature and either Surf or Steam Eruption to outpace and OHKO maximum speed Adamant Primal Groudon in a 1v1 scenario. Alternatively, Mega Diancie can use an EV Spread of 64 HP / 252 Atk / 96 SpA / 96 Spe with a Naughty nature to do the same with Scald. Further, 204 Speed EVs can be to outpace Jolly Primal Groudon. Water Shuriken is an option that allows Mega Diancie to revenge kill heavily chipped Primal Groudon in a pinch. However, it’s inconsistent if Primal Groudon is healthy, as Mega Diancie needs all five hits of Water Shuriken to connect in order to KO, even after Fake Out. Mega Diancie can make use of Pursuit to catch frail sweepers like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y switching out. Parting Shot is an option to maintain momentum, as Diancie forces switches against many non-Wonder Guard foes. V-Create is an alternative to Sacred Fire that OHKOes standard Registeel after Stealth Rock and 2HKOes standard Mega Steelix. However, the utility and flexibility of Sacred Fire is usually superior, as such foes are both rare and are hit hard by Sacred Fire anyway. Coverage moves to hit specific Wonder Guard users, such as Gunk Shot, Bolt Strike, Thousand Arrows, and Close Combat are options over Boomburst or Sacred Fire, though they’re quite situational and matchup dependent. Of those options, Close Combat, Precipice Blades, and Thousand Arrows are the most worth considering for their ability to heavily damage Magic Bounce Steel-types. Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and Spikes are all usable alternatives to Stealth Rock should a teammate already have it or if the specific utility of any of the aforementioned entry hazards is desired. Spore is an option in the last moveslot, as Mega Diancie forces out most common Magic Bounce users and Safety Goggles Wonder Guard users are relatively rare. Life Orb is an alternate item that improves Mega Diancie's matchup against bulky Pokemon neutral to Fairy-type attacks, such as Perish Song Lugia, though it does cut into Mega Diancie’s longevity and ability to enter the battlefield repeatedly in longer games. Finally, Diancite, Shed Shell, and Safety Goggles are alternate items that can improve Mega Diancie's matchup against Trick, Shadow Tag, and Spore users, respectively. However, their applications are all far more narrow than Lum Berry or Pixie Plate.</p> <p>On Mold Breaker Diancie, Searing Shot is an option over Spore or Dark Void to break past would-be checks, such as Registeel and the rare Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn—alternatively, Blue Flare can OHKO Registeel after a Shell Smash, but Searing Shot is usually better due to its accuracy and most of Mega Diancie's checks getting worn down often by entry hazards. Further, lacking a sleep move leaves Mega Diancie vulnerable against offensive teams. Either Fire-type move can also be run over Steam Eruption, but this leaves Mega Diancie vulnerable against healthy Primal Groudon running Lum Berry. Diamond Storm KOes Ho-Oh and threatens Wonder Guard Blissey, but like Fire-type coverage, it is hard to fit. Earth Power and Precipice Blades are usable over Steam Eruption, with the former threatening Registeel and Mega Steelix and the latter better threatening Registeel and Blissey; however, usually neither is worth it, as they leave Mega Diancie walled by Ho-Oh and forced out by unscouted Mega Scizor. King's Shield is another option for the first moveslot, as it provides protection against many Pokemon: -ate Speed users such as Kyurem-B, Pixilate Mega Diancie, and Mega Abomasnow, Huge Power Slaking and Regigigas not running Water Shuriken, and to an extent Shadow Tag Slaking and Regigigas. However, lacking a sleep move leaves Mega Diancie forced out by healthy Primal Kyogre and Wonder Guard Blissey with Knock Off, and King's Shield does not help if Mega Diancie is already weakened. Moonblast can work over Judgment, as it is still a fairly powerful STAB move and allows Mega Diancie to run useful items like Lum Berry, Focus Sash, and Leftovers, but the loss in power and vulnerability to opposing Imposter users is usually too much to justify running it. Finally, a Timid nature can be run to outspeed Adamant or Modest Mega Rayquaza, Modest Mega Latios, opposing Mold Breaker Mega Diancie, and Modest Arceus, but the loss in power—and the inherent risks in staying in on most of these threats—means Timid is often not worth it.</p> <p>Besides Pixilate and Shell Smash Mold Breaker sets, Mega Diancie can opt for two niche options in Choice Specs + Mold Breaker and Huge Power. The former takes advantage of Mega Diancie's ability to pose an immediate threat, forcing switches, and often sacks, with Choice Specs-boosted Moonblast, Steam Eruption, Fire-type coverage (or Trick), and Volt Switch. Huge Power Mega Diancie largely relies on the surprise disguising itself as Pixilate Mega Diancie until it hopefully KOes an opposing Wonder Guard user. While these are usable options, Choice Specs Mega Diancie is often too slow to make progress against more offensive teams and can be a pain to Imposter-proof, and Huge Power Mega Diancie is virtually completely inferior to Mega Mewtwowhen the surprise is revealed.</p> <p>On Mega Diancie spam teams—that is, teams with three or more Mega Diancie—fringe sets such as Choice Scarf + Huge Power, Prankster, Shell Smash + Wonder Guard, Parental Bond, No Guard, and Magic Bounce have significantly increased viability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon almost directly counters the majority of Pixilate Mega Diancie sets. However, variants with Water-type coverage can defeat unboosted and non-Choice Scarf Primal Groudon sets in a 1v1 scenario.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Users</strong>: Pixilate Mega Diancie is forced out by vast majority of Wonder Guard users. However, Gastro Acid variants of Mega Diancie can overcome this to some extent.</p> <p><strong>King's Shield Sweepers</strong>: Pixilate Mega Diancie ordinarily forces out most Mold Breaker sweepers; however, those carrying King's Shield can force Mega Diancie to play mind games, forcing it out if it guesses wrong.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Shadow Tag Users</strong>: Some offensive Shadow Tag users, namely Primal Groudon, are bulky enough to survive Pixilate Mega Diancie's Fake Out and Extreme Speed and can OHKO back with a super-effective Ground-, Steel-, or Water-type move. Additionally, Shadow Tag revenge killers like Regigigas and Slaking can trap and KO both Pixilate and Mold Breaker Mega Diancie with Fake Out and Bullet Punch if they’re healthy enough to survive an Extreme Speed. For Mold Breaker Diancie, this necessitates Mega Diancie teammates with Substitute + Baton Pass to make progress, especially when the Shadow Tag Slaking or Regigigas user runs pivoting support. However, offensive Shadow Tag users without priority usually can't threaten a boosted Mold Breaker Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Magic Bounce Steel-types such as Registeel and Mega Steelix can prevent Pixilate Mega Diancie lacking Fire coverage from making much, if any, progress. Additionally, defensive Steel-types like Registeel, Mega Scizor, and Escavalier can switch into most Mold Breaker Mega Diancie sets and, if they have one, force it out with a Steel-type STAB option. However, such checks are vulnerable, either to getting worn down over the course of a game or to Mega Diancie's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Mold Breaker Mega Diancie being relatively frail, priority revenge killers almost always force it out. In particular, Huge Power Mega Gyarados outright OHKOes it with Water Shuriken, and Mega Diancie switching out can let Pursuit KO if it is heavily damaged. -Ate Speed users such as Mega Abomasnow, Pixilate Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, and Mega Rayquaza can also threaten Mega Diancie, being able to set entry hazards or otherwise support their team when Mega Diancie is forced to switch. However, most revenge killers require pivoting support to not risk Mega Diancie OHKOing them.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Although Mold Breaker Mega Diancie boasts a resistance to Knock Off, losing Pixie Plate means it fails to seriously threaten most teams. However, Trick or Knock Off users that Mega Diancie does not threaten when boosted are relatively rare.</p> <p><strong>Wonder Guard Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Extremely specially defensive Wonder Guard users in Blissey and Chansey are reliable switch-ins to most Mold Breaker Mega Diancie sets, as Judgment does not 2HKO them after Shell Smash. However, they are prone to getting worn down by entry hazards, and taking Spore or Dark Void can let Mega Diancie set up enough to power through them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Toxic Orb Users</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon running Toxic Orb, in particular Poison Heal Primal Kyogre, are major obstacles to most Mold Breaker Mega Diancie sets when healthy and poisoned, as Spore and Dark Void don't affect them. Poison Heal Primal Kyogre can threaten Mega Diancie with Scald and can switch into it with relative ease when healthy. Another Toxic Orb user, Ho-Oh, can threaten Mega Diancie with niche options in Wood Hammer and Thousand Arrows; the former OHKOes with after Shell Smash, while the latter OHKOes boosted Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock. However, it can't do much back to Mega Diancie if lacking either niche move. While fairly reliable against Mega Diancie one-on-one, most Toxic Orb switch-ins are vulnerable to being removed by a Shadow Tag user, meaning if Mega Diancie has Shadow Tag support, they are not reliable switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Plate + Imposter Users</strong>: While relatively rare, opposing Imposter users using a Plate item, in particular Pixie Plate, Iron Plate, or Spooky Plate, can annoy most Mold Breaker Mega Diancie, especially as Plate items are generally unexpected items on Imposter users. However, these Imposter users must win a Speed tie against Mega Diancie, as well as other Mold Breaker sweepers they hope to check, so they are generally suboptimal picks overall.</p>",

      "Pixilate Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<p>High offensive stats and excellent offensive typing make Pixilate Mega Diancie a powerful revenge killer. Boosted by Pixilate, Fake Out and Extreme Speed allow Mega Diancie to revenge kill most No Guard users and Mold Breaker sweepers lacking King's Shield, Primal Groudon being the one notable exception. Boomburst is an incredibly powerful STAB move thanks to Pixilate that notably OHKOes Giratina. Alternatively, Sacred Fire can be used to hit Steel-type Magic Bounce users hard and to OHKO Bug / Steel type Wonder Guard users like Mega Scizor and Escavalier. Stealth Rock takes advantage of Pixilate Mega Diancie's ability to force out most No Guard, Mold Breaker, and Magic Bounce users. Alternatively, Gastro Acid takes advantage of Mega Diancie's ability to force Wonder Guard users in. Lum Berry is an exceptionally item useful for Mega Diancie, allowing it to switch into Spore, Glare, and Will-O-Wisp from Mold Breaker foes and Prankster Giratina. Pixie Plate is an alternative that augments Mega Diancie's overall damage output; notably, it allows Mega Diancie to KO unboosted Mega Gengar with Fake Out and Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock. As Mega Diancie relies on Fake Out and Extreme Speed against the majority of foes, Speed investment is unnecessary. A Brave nature and 4 Special Attack EVs allow Mega Diancie to OHKO standard Giratina with Boomburst. On sets without Boomburst, an Adamant nature and an EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def should be used.</p> <p>Due to its inability to consistently revenge kill Primal Groudon, Pixilate Mega Diancie fits best on offensive teams that have room for multiple revenge killers. In particular, Choice Scarf Imposter Chansey, Choice Scarf Shadow Tag users, and Choice Scarf No Guard users make excellent teammates thanks to their ability to revenge kill nearly all variants of Primal Groudon and most King's Shield Mold Breaker sweepers. Prankster Giratina also makes an excellent teammate due to its ability to switch into and check Primal Groudon. Additionally, Mega Diancie appreciates Prankster Giratina's ability to force out most defensive Wonder Guard users—Mega Diancie's most common switch-ins—with Encore and Curse. Offensive Shadow Tag users like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y also make excellent teammates for their ability to trap and KO Wonder Guard users that frequently forgo Shed Shell, such as the ever popular Substitute + Baton Pass Xerneas, another common switch-in to Pixilate Mega Diancie. Powerful Mold Breaker teammates like Choice Band Primal Groudon, although invaluable on nearly every team structure, are especially valuable teammates to Pixilate Mega Diancie for their ability break through the Wonder Guard users that switch into Mega Diancie. Finally, Mega Diancie appreciates the Defog, Aromatherapy, Wish, and Imposter-proofing support that support Wonder Guard teammates like Cresselia and Primal Kyogre can provide.</p>"

      "Shell Smash Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Mold Breaker Mega Diancie is an amazing sweeper. It has a great STAB move that helps Imposter-proof it in Pixie Plate Judgment, impressive offensive stats, and fairly good Speed. Spore and Dark Void are excellent options to gain free setup turns against would-be checks, such as specially defensive Wonder Guard Primal Kyogre and Blissey. Spore is usually preferred because it means one teammate, Safety Goggles + Prankster Giratina, is enough to almost perfectly Imposter-proof Mega Diancie. However, Dark Void is also a great option due to bypassing opposing Safety Goggles users. Shell Smash immensely bolsters Mega Diancie's offensive prowess in a single turn. Fairy-type Judgment is an exceptionally valuable STAB move to have; not only is it noticeably stronger than Moonblast, but it also greatly diminishes the pressure that Imposter Chansey imposes on Mega Diancie, letting Giratina and specially defensive Primal Kyogre Imposter-proof it extremely well. This reduced pressure allows it to safely set up with Shell Smash in nearly any matchup. Additionally, Judgment threatens a wide enough portion of the metagame that Mega Diancie can often force progress without relying on Shell Smash boosts. Steam Eruption is an amazing coverage option that OHKOes Primal Groudon, 2HKOes Ho-Oh after a Shell Smash, and hits defensive Steel-types, like Wonder Guard Mega Scizor, Mega Steelix, and to an extent Registeel. Although some Steel-types, like Registeel running Knock Off, can stand up to a boosted Steam Eruption and threaten Mega Diancie's wallbreaking, Mega Diancie can annoy them by burning them over the course of the game. Mold Breaker allows Mega Diancie to ignore Wonder Guard, letting it make maximum use of its great offensive typing. A Modest nature further increases Mega Diancie's power, with it notably OHKOing uninvested Mega Latios after Stealth Rock and offensive Arceus after a Shell Smash. 252 Speed EVs, even without Timid, are enough to outspeed a sizable portion of the metagame.</p> <p>Mega Diancie fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that can take advantage of its offensive typing and resistance to Imposter Chansey to get and retain momentum. They must also tolerate Mega Diancie's mediocre Speed for a frail Shell Smash sweeper. Mega Diancie fits well into the metagame's most dominant core of Mold Breaker Primal Groudon, Giratina, and Substitute + Baton Pass Wonder Guard Xerneas; it threatens Primal Groudon's most prominent switch-in in Giratina, broadly does well in most matchups Primal Groudon and Giratina struggle in, and is an excellent recipient of Substitutes from Xerneas. In return, Primal Groudon can switch into its defensive checks like Wonder Guard Blissey and provide Stealth Rock support, Giratina can come in on Choice Band Mega Rayquaza and Choice Scarf Primal Groudon, and Xerneas can switch in on -ate Speed users that would otherwise take full advantage of Mega Diancie's need to switch out. As Mega Diancie is quite frail, Substitute support from Baton Pass users like Wonder Guard Xerneas, Mega Swampert, and Magic Bounce Giratina is appreciated, even when Mega Diancie is not used in the aforementioned core. Shadow Tag users, in particular Mega Mewtwo X and Primal Groudon, can remove most checks to Mega Diancie with Fire-type coverage or STAB moves. Mega Mewtwo X also revenge kills Huge Power Mega Gyarados, which can force Mega Diancie out with Water Shuriken—or force a coinflip scenario with Water Shuriken and Pursuit when Mega Diancie is weakened. Pursuit users, in particular Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar, work well with Mega Diancie, as they can heavily damage Pokemon that can remove it before Shell Smash, in particular Shadow Tag Slaking and Regigigas. Finally, slow defensive Wonder Guard users, such as Primal Kyogre, Slaking, Mega Audino, Blissey, and Escavalier, can provide Defog and Aromatherapy support while also acting as slow pivots, helping to get Mega Diancie on the field.</p>"
