  "Milotic": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>With a pure Water typing that gives it no physical weakness and a usable Defense stat, Milotic stands out as one of the main defensive Pokemon in the tier. Although it receives a lot of competition from fellow bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune, as it has an inferior Defense stat and lacks advantages such as Swampert's resistance to Rock and Suicune's access to Calm Mind, there are solid reasons to use it. Its access to Recover makes it not as easily worn down by repeated damage, and its defensive stats make it one of the best answers to mixed attackers such as Tyranitar and Salamence.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat is an interesting option to surprise Pokemon that may try to hit Milotic with a special attack, because it can survive most of them and heal itself with Recover later. An offensive, fast EV spread can be used, as it allows Milotic to heavily damage foes with attacking moves and have a greater chance to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep with Hypnosis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Celebi is the best counter to Milotic. It takes basically nothing from Surf, takes Ice Beam quite well, and has Natural Cure to mitigate status. It can also force Milotic out via Leech Seed or begin setting up on it with Calm Mind. Snorlax takes little damage from Milotic's attacks and can capitalize on it by setting up with Curse, especially if Milotic does not have Hypnosis or Sleep Clause has already been activated. Thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey doesn't care too much about anything Milotic does and can force it out with the threat of Toxic and the rare Sing. However, other variants of Blissey can't do much to Milotic except stalling it out for a bit. Other Pokemon with Natural Cure such as Starmie can stall out Milotic's PP. Rest and Substitute variants of Suicune can turn Milotic into setup fodder, though other variants don't appreciate being statused. Jirachi can also set up against Milotic, but it must be wary of switching in, as it does not brush off Milotic's attacks as easily as the previously mentioned Pokemon. With the significant damage output their STAB Thunderbolt provides against Milotic, Electric-type Pokemon like Zapdos and Jolteon can force it out. However, they don't appreciate taking repeated attacks or status. Standard Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster can lay Spikes against Milotic if they are not put to sleep. Afterwards, the combination of sand and Spikes severely reduces Milotic's efficacy, because indirect damage puts it into 2HKO range of many attacks that otherwise 3HKO it, such as +1 Salamence's Hidden Power Flying, +1 Tyranitar's Rock Slide, Choice Band Metagross's Earthquake, Choice Band Flygon's Earthquake, and Gengar's Thunderbolt. Although Heracross can't take repeated damage, it can be especially troublesome for Milotic; once it is affected by Toxic, Guts makes it really dangerous.</p>",

        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf hits Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Aerodactyl super effectively and has reliable damage output against a number of other Pokemon such as Metagross. Recover allows Milotic to stay healthy consistently and offsets its lacking Defense. Toxic lets Milotic outstall a number of Pokemon such as Salamence without Dragon Dance and makes it threatening to opposing Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune. Refresh is particularly useful against Pokemon on stall or balanced teams such as defensive Swampert and standard Skarmory that rely on Toxic to punish Milotic. Ice Beam makes Milotic an amazing counter to Salamence, does a lot of damage to Flygon, and hits Celebi and Zapdos relatively hard on the switch. Hypnosis gives Milotic chances to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, thus stopping Spikers such as Skarmory and Forretress or setup sweepers such as CurseLax from taking advantage of Milotic for entry hazards or boosts.</p> <p>Maximum physical bulk lets the physically defensive prowess of Milotic's pure Water typing shine. It is reasonable to creep a bit on Speed, as Milotic is in a fairly common Speed tier that includes most Tyranitar and slow variants of Metagross. However, it is not recommended to use under 224 Defense EVs, as this will give Adamant Salamence a chance to 2HKO Milotic with +1 Hidden Power Flying in sand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams with Milotic appreciate Pokemon that can take powerful Electric-type moves; as a special wall, Celebi resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks for Milotic, while Milotic resists Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Celebi. Although Milotic can act as a check to Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar and Choice Band Aerodactyl, unlike Swampert, it struggles to counter them because it lacks a Rock resistance, has a rather mediocre Defense stat, and faces the threat of flinches from their STAB Rock Slide. Therefore, Steel-type Pokemon such as Metagross and Jirachi that resist Rock-type attacks can be good partners. However, if either of them is chosen as Milotic's teammate, it is also recommended to have an extra Tyranitar answer because Earthquake hits them hard. Ground-type Pokemon not only resist Rock-type attacks but also can pivot into Electric-type attacks. Firstly, Claydol and the rare Donphan are spinners that can let Milotic avoid being chipped by Spikes. Secondly, Dugtrio and Flygon can deal with physical Tyranitar rather effectively. Last but not least, it is not unheard of to run Swampert and Milotic on the same team because one can be sent out earlier, thus letting the other stay healthy for physical attackers late-game.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Venusaur has above-average bulk and a good support movepool; its offensive choices are somewhat limited, however. Still, the ability to spread status is always nice, and Venusaur can put opponents to sleep or poison them (with either Sludge Bomb or Toxic), so with the support of a counter to Celebi and Blissey, such as Hidden Power Bug Dugtrio, Venusaur can effectively cripple a wide range of threats and prove to be a general nuisance for the opponent.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can beat Salamence on switches, but Venusaur needs at least 270 Special Attack (136 EVs without a boosting nature) to even have a shot at OHKOing the standard 4/0 Choice Band Salamence; 319 Special Attack--216 EVs and a boosting nature--is needed for the guaranteed OHKO. With maximum Special Attack investment, Venusaur has a 67% chance to OHKO the standard 120/0 Dragon Dance Salamence. Hidden Power Grass is a bit stronger than Razor Leaf and has 100% accuracy, but it's not usually worth sacrificing the high critical hit rate and a Hidden Power slot. Body Slam can paralyze Salamence, among others. Don't even think about Sunny Day + Solar Beam, however; Venusaur is too slow to set it up, and is outclassed by other Chlorophyll Pokemon, such as Exeggutor. Similarly, Growth can be used to boost Venusaur's mediocre Special Attack, but such a set is better done by Calm Mind Celebi.</p> <p>Light Screen can be used to help the whole team take special hits more easily. Roar can force out Substitute, Agility, or Baton Pass Zapdos, and is another alternative to stopping Calm Mind Raikou. It also defeats Ninjask, but watch out for Hidden Power Flying. Charm can annoy the likes of Salamence, Gyarados, Snorlax, and Swampert. Protect scouts Explosion and Choice Band moves, and, more importantly, gives Venusaur more Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery. Toxic is a decent move for stall-oriented teams, and can pair nicely with Leech Seed. Just make sure you have a way to stop Skarmory and Celebi--consider Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Fire, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory walls any set that lacks Hidden Power Fire. Gyarados and Salamence can tank all Venusaur's attacks bar odd Hidden Powers. Celebi sops up Leech Seed nicely, resists Grass-type attacks, and laughs at anything offensive Venusaur throws at it, save Sludge Bomb. Nonetheless, all of the above have STAB super effective attacks to put a hurting on Venusaur. Gengar, Weezing, Forretress, and Metagross resist or are immune to both Venusaur's STAB moves, but Venusaur can still put them to sleep or stall them with Leech Seed; Metagross also needs to watch out for Earthquake and Hidden Power Fire. Tentacruel makes Venusaur's life hard with Liquid Ooze and Substitute to thwart Leech Seed, and packs either super effective Ice Beam or STAB Swords Dance-boosted Sludge Bomb; however, Earthquake can take it down.</p> <p>Blissey hates Leech Seed and Sleep Powder, but soaks up all special attacks and easily survives two Sludge Bombs. Snorlax beats Venusaur in a Curse war, unless the latter is carrying Leech Seed. Regice and Articuno don't particularly care for Hidden Power Fire and can fire off STAB Ice Beams, so Venusaur can't stay in to use Sludge Bomb is risky.</p> <p>Most counters need to be wary of switching into Venusaur, as Sleep Powder can put even the sturdiest foe out of commission if they are not prepared for it. However, Hypno and Banette don't take much damage from Venusaur's STAB attacks and are immune to Sleep Powder. The former can deal heavy damage with STAB Psychic, while the latter can burn Venusaur with Will-O-Wisp and remove its item with Knock Off. Heracross and Ursaring actually benefit from Venusaur's Sleep Powder thanks to Guts, and can take advantage of this with Sleep Talk and a powerful STAB move.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Sludge Bomb is the third option here for a reason--the aim of this set is not to sweep or deal heavy damage to opponents. Venusaur will probably be met straight up by Skarmory, if not Celebi, so Sleep Powder should be its first move, followed by Leech Seed. It can then wear down the opponent with Sludge Bomb, healing when necessary with Synthesis. You should note, however, that sandstorm reduces Synthesis's recovery from 50% to a measly 25%.</p> <p>The EV spread is not set in stone, but all variants should run 252 HP EVs for maximum tanking ability and a few EVs in Speed. The rest is split between Defense and Special Defense depending on the threats that you wish Venusaur to wall. Venusaur's Special Defense is quite a bit better than its Defense, and it has more special resistances too, so it works very well as a special tank. With a Careful nature and heavy investment in Special Defense, this set is good at walling even Hidden Power Ice variants of Zapdos and Raikou for quite a while. However, if you would rather Venusaur take on physical threats such as Fighting-types or Swampert, focus on Defense instead.</p>"

          "description": "<p>This might not really be a good idea with the ubiquity of Skarmory, but it can be surprisingly effective with Magneton support. Sludge Bomb is Venusaur's physical STAB and deals heavy damage after a boost or two. Earthquake covers Metagross and Tyranitar, and if you're afraid of Ghost-types, run Hidden Power Ghost over Sleep Powder in the last moveslot.</p> <p>108 Speed EVs enable Venusaur to outspeed neutral-natured Tyranitar, while the 208 HP EVs give it a healthy 353 HP to make setting up easier. The rest of the EVs are dumped in Attack, and in conjunction with an Adamant nature, this gives Venusaur sufficient firepower to pull off a sweep. If you're going with Curse, remove all Speed EVs, maximize HP, and put the leftover EVs into one of its defenses. Defense investment enables Venusaur to set up Curse boosts with ease on physical attackers such as Snorlax, while Special Defense EVs let Venusaur take special hits well while boosting itself on the physical side.</p>"

Venusaur is walled by threats such as Salamence, but once they are removed by a teammate, it can pick its way through the opponent's team.</p> <p>If Blissey is their only decent counter to Venusaur, you can put it to sleep with Sleep Powder with some prediction. Assume a situation in which Venusaur is facing down Blissey, and the opponent has Swampert and Skarmory waiting in the wings. If Venusaur puts Skarmory to sleep, Blissey can come in and stall Venusaur out of PP with Soft-Boiled, go for the freeze with Ice Beam, or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. If Blissey is put to sleep, however, it might switch out to heal off the status with Natural Cure, and then come right back in. In that case, reuse your sleep move, as Natural Cure means you won't be violating Sleep Clause. You can do the same thing to potentially beat Celebi, but you have to correctly predict Celebi switch-ins; otherwise, it can hurt Venusaur with a faster Psychic.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Charmeleon's niche in the NU tier is being the third fastest Fire-type available, sitting just under Ponyta and Magby, while sporting all-around better stats than either of those two. However, it's really one-dimensional, as it really shouldn't be doing anything other than its standard special attacking set. That said, it isn't exactly easy to wall, which makes it a good fit on heavy offense teams that want a hard-hitting Fire-type that's quite a bit faster than Flareon. If you're unconcerned about the Speed and just want some Fire power, Flareon should be your Fire-type of choice.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charmeleon actually has interesting setup options in its movepool, but it's rather hard to use them properly, and they are all ultimately done better by Pokemon like Vigoroth. However, the one move that really stands out in Charmeleon's movepool is Belly Drum, which can be super dangerous under the right circumstances, as Charmeleon is fast and threatening enough to guarantee itself a Substitute in most situations and begin setting up. With a moveset of Belly Drum / Substitute / Return / Rock Slide while holding a Salac Berry, Charmeleon could prove to be pretty threatening even without any physical STAB attacks. Unfortunately, even at +6, Charmeleon will lose to physical stalwarts like Relicanth, which can still avoid the 2HKO from Rock Slide or Return and can easily OHKO back. For the same reasons, a Swords Dance or SubPunch set can do some damage under the right circumstances but require way too much support to pull off properly and are stopped cold by popular physical walls.</p> <p>Finally, Sunny Day is an option to boost Charmeleon's Fire power and help support Chlorophyll sweepers like Bellossom. Under sun, Charmeleon has a really good chance to OHKO Hitmonchan with Overheat, which is guaranteed with a layer of Spikes, and Charmeleon even has a small chance to 2HKO 252 / 252+ Dewgong with Fire Blast. Unfortunately, Charmeleon lacks Solar Beam or anything else to benefit from the sun, but it also comes with the benefit of weakening Water-type attacks directed its way.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kecleon is an almost complete stop to any special Charmeleon set and can proceed to either paralyze it with Thunder Wave and make Charmeleon useless or simply 2HKO it with Return. Defensive Flareon and Magcargo are the next best stops to any special Charmeleon set, as they fear nothing it can throw at them apart from Rock Slide or Toxic. They probably can't do much in return, but they will ultimately outlast Charmeleon. Wailord, Pelipper, and other Water-types that can avoid the 4x hit from Hidden Power Grass are other really good switch-ins to Charmeleon and can easily OHKO it with their STAB Water-type moves. Most of the Pokemon that can outspeed Charmeleon can also threaten it, including Pidgeot, Murkrow, Plusle, and Haunter. Finally, Sudowoodo can just barely avoid the 2HKO from Fire Blast + Hidden Power Grass and proceed to OHKO Charmeleon with its STAB move.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Fire Blast is going to be the main STAB move Charmeleon will be using, with Overheat available in the second slot as a secondary STAB nuke that can force some targets like Lickitung to immediately heal and give Charmeleon a safe switch out. To demonstrate a situation where Overheat can come in handy: with a Modest nature, Charmeleon will always OHKO max HP Glalie with Fire Blast, but with a Timid nature, that drops to about a 50% chance, while Overheat stays at a 100% chance to OHKO. So, depending on the nature choice and the target, having both Fire Blast and Overheat available is nice to do what Charmeleon wants to—which is blow stuff away.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass shreds apart the Rock- and Water-types that would otherwise be able to switch into Charmeleon's Fire-type attacks, notably easily 2HKOing Whiscash. Dragon Claw fills out the last slot as a great super effective hit on Shelgon, preventing it from using Charmeleon as setup bait, as well as getting a decent neutral hit on Flareon and other Fire-types. Rock Slide is a good alternative that deals significantly more damage to Flareon even with a -Atk nature at the cost of missing out on Shelgon and the rare Dragonair. The power difference between the two moves on other Fire-type targets is pretty negligible.</p> <p>Modest gives Charmeleon the power it needs, such as OHKOing 252 / 252+ Roselia with Fire Blast, whereas Timid can allow Charmeleon to outrun and 2HKO Jolly Hitmonchan and prevent it from switching into Charmeleon, which is highly desirable on the kind of heavy offense team you would typically want to use Charmeleon on. Charcoal boosts the power of Charmeleon's Fire-type moves even more, which works best when using a Timid nature to make up for some of the lost power. Charmeleon's available special movepool is pretty barren apart from the given moves above. Flamethrower is available as a guaranteed safe move and is usable over Overheat, but the drop in power is pretty significant. Hidden Power Water is usable as a super effective hit on Rock- and Fire-types, but Charmeleon then has almost no way of combating Water-types, making it easy setup prey for dangerous threats like Huntail. Finally, Toxic is always available to cripple Flareon and other special walls in the long run.</p> <p>Flareon and Magcargo give this set a hard time even if you choose to run Rock Slide, making your own Water- and Rock-types like Seadra and Relicanth good teammates. Kecleon completely walls this set, meaning Hitmonchan is a great teammate to bust through it as well as Lickitung and Wigglytuff, which can otherwise stomach a couple hits from Charmeleon. Spikes support is amazing with this set, as all of Charmeleon's checks are grounded, making Cacturne and Roselia fantastic teammates as well.</p>"

Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current ADV OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Using Charizard requires a lot of advance planning, but it's usually worth the effort. Thanks to Belly Drum, it can decimate teams after bulky Waters have been worn down and faster Pokemon such as Starmie and Gengar removed; Charizard can even run a Salac Berry to help with the latter problem. Another of Charizard's issues is its lack of moveslots: the more setup moves it runs, the fewer attacking options it gets. However, a smart player can always bluff, or even pair Charizard with Dugtrio, Magneton, or Explosion users to clear the way for it. To put it simply, Charizard is a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast on every set for people who prefer accuracy to power, and it comes in especially handy when your Belly Drum-boosted Charizard is facing down a half-health Skarmory. Fire Blast does more damage on average, though, and its extra power is helpful against Weezing and Celebi. Overheat is both accurate and powerful, but if your opponent packs two Pokemon you'll need to use a Fire move for, you're screwed.</p> <p>The other moves Charizard gets are rather novel, and usually too circumstantial to work. Sunny Day not only weakens the Water moves Charizard is weak to, but also boosts Charizard's Fire moves, and when combined with Blaze, lets it pack a punch. A Swords Dance-boosted Brick Break can bust up Snorlax, Tyranitar and Blissey, but Belly Drum or even Focus Punch are usually better options. Toxic can annoy Swampert, Tyranitar, Aerodactyl and some others; it isn't a bad option as Charizard can lure your opponent's main Water-type and help wear it down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune, Swampert, Milotic, and Vaporeon will always survive whatever an unboosted Charizard throws at them, falling only to a Belly Drum-boosted Double-Edge, or in Swampert's case, Hidden Power Grass. They can then counter with a Surf or Hydro Pump. Zapdos Speed ties with Charizard, switches in easily on Earthquake, Hidden Power Flying, and even Fire moves to an extent, and will OHKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Any user of Rock moves also threatens Charizard: Aerodactyl resists most of Charizard's moves, outspeeds it, and OHKOes it with Rock Slide. Tyranitar can take an unboosted Earthquake and either cripple it with Thunderbolt or KO it with STAB Rock Slide. Furthermore, Tyranitar's mere existence cripples Belly Drum variants, as sandstorm's residual damage greatly shortens Charizard's lifespan and limits its ability to sweep.</p>",

The various Bellyzard sets face numerous problems: all variants have trouble with bulky Waters, sets lacking Substitute face difficulty in activating their Salac Berry, while sets that run Substitute forgo crucial coverage. Fortunately, this Charizard avoids all these issues.</p> <p>Double-Edge OHKOes Milotic, Swampert, Vaporeon, and even Suicune after some minor damage, and Charizard survives the recoil to enter Salac Berry range. After obtaining the boost, simply use Earthquake and Charizard's Blaze-boosted Fire move to sweep. Double-Edge can be used once more as a kamikaze move, but few teams have multiple Pokemon that resist both Fire and Ground. Nonetheless, it's best to wait until you know most of their team before trying to set up Charizard.</p> <p>As with every variant that uses Salac Berry or Dragon Dance, Charizard should hit a Speed stat of 270 to outspeed Adamant Heracross before a boost. The minimum Speed one should run is 264, while maximizing Speed lets Charizard tie with Salamence. Next, maximize its main offensive stat and put any spare EVs into the other attacking stat.</p>"

Alternatively, one could Belly Drum on a switch at full health, fire off attacks without the Salac boost, and switch out against faster foes. To switch in and Belly Drum a second time, however, you will have to switch Charizard in on a predicted Skarmory or Forretress switch, or on a Choice Band user locked into Earthquake.</p>"},
        "Substitute + Belly Drum": {"description": "<p>Belly Drum Charizard that run Substitute play very differently to those that don't. You should look to switch this in on the likes of Skarmory using Spikes, and Substitute as your opponent switches to a Water-type not named Suicune. Then Belly Drum to get Salac Berry's boost, and sweep. While it isn't as effective, it's much easier to successfully set up.</p> <p>If using Hidden Power Flying, be sure to transfer 4 EVs from Special Attack to Speed. The 30 HP IV makes Charizard's HP divisible by 4, enabling it to activate Salac Berry after a Substitute and a Belly Drum.</p>"},

Rapid Spin provides team support, as Spikes tends to wear down common teammates for Wartortle; however, due to how uncommon Spikes is, Rapid Spin is seldom worth dropping a coverage or support move for.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Flaaffy and Magnemite threaten Wartortle with Thunderbolt, while Wartortle is unable to 2HKO either with Surf. Voltorb is worth mentioning, as it not only outpaces Wartortle even after a Salac Berry boost but also 2HKOes Wartortle if it is healthy.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Specially defensive Gloom is the premier Wartortle check, as it can shrug off an Ice Beam and is immune to Toxic. Tropius, on the other hand, is 2HKOed by Ice Beam, meaning it has enough time to use Sunny Day and then Solar Beam to OHKO Wartortle.

This allows it to threaten Rock- and Ground-types, cementing it as one of the best answers to Anorith, Onix, and Rhyhorn. Surf threatens the aforementioned Rock- and Ground-types and can be powered up by Torrent to heavily damage bulkier Pokemon like Ariados, Castform, and Mightyena. Ice Beam allows Wartortle to threaten Tropius and physically defensive Gloom. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO bulky Clamperl and Corsola, which threaten Wartortle. Toxic allows Wartortle to threaten other Water-types such as Seaking, Chinchou, and Wartortle. Refresh maintains Wartortle's staying power, curing status from Pokemon such as Mightyena and Koffing. Protect is required to fully use Wartortle's defensive capabilities, as it allows Wartortle to scout against Choice Band users such as Aipom, Doduo, and Anorith and rack up passive recovery from Leftovers. Wartortle's HP and Defense investment ensures it can force a trade with Choice Band Aipom if it uses Double-Edge; Wartortle wins the matchup if Aipoms opts to go for Return instead. Wartortle's Special Attack investment allows it to always 3HKO max HP Mightyena with no Special Defense investment.</p> <p>Bulky offense and balanced teams greatly appreciate Wartortle's ability to trade with Aipom and check Rock- and Ground-types. However, Wartortle is unable to do both of these jobs simultaneously. For this reason, Wartortle appreciates other physically defensive Pokemon, such as Onix, Mightyena, and Koffing, as teammates. Onix pairs exceptionally well with Wartortle, as it can wall Aipom and threaten Anorith with Rock Slide, while Onix appreciates Wartortle coming in on opposing Water-types. Mightyena threatens and removes specially defensive Gloom, which otherwise completely walls Wartortle. Moreover, Fire-types such as Ponyta and Quilava can also check Grass-types like Gloom and Sunflora. These Fire-types also appreciate Wartortle as a dedicated Rock- and Ground-type check, as it can stomach hits from Onix and Rhyhorn. Physical wallbreakers, including Aipom, Doduo, Volbeat, and Anorith, can threaten and remove specially defensive Pokemon that Wartortle struggles with, such as Porygon, Gloom, Delcatty, and Noctowl. Wartortle also struggles with faster special attackers like Seaking, Flaaffy, and Voltorb, so specially defensive Pokemon like Delcatty, Porygon, and Gloom pair well with it. Delcatty and Wartortle pair exceptionally well together, as Delcatty can pass Wish to Wartortle, improving its overall longevity. Additionally, Wartortle can switch into Rock-types such as Onix and Rhyhorn, which Delcatty lures in. If Wartortle lacks Refresh, then Heal Bell users, most notably Delcatty and Mightyena, pair well with it.</p>"

Surf allows Wartortle to threaten Koffing as well as Rock- and Ground-types such as Cubone, Onix, and Rhyhorn. Seismic Toss is Wartortle's most consistent attacking move, as it allows Wartortle to chip switch-ins such as Flaaffy, Noctowl, and Porygon, forcing the latter two to use Rest or Recover. Alternatively, Toxic compensates for Surf's inability to chip other Water-types like Seaking and Wartortle, threatens Porygon, and forces Noctowl to use Rest. Refresh allows Wartortle to shrug off burn and poison, which otherwise severely limit its effectiveness in defensive roles. Protect allows Wartortle to gain passive recovery from Leftovers more easily and provides an excellent opportunity to scout Choice Band users such as Seaking, Aipom, and Doduo.</p> <p>Wartortle fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate a reliable defensive answer to Ponyta. Grounded Double-Edge users such as Aipom and Ponyta appreciate Wartortle's defensive value against Rock- and Ground-types such as Onix, Rhyhorn, and Anorith. In return, these Pokemon check specially defensive foes such as Noctowl and Porygon. Pokemon that can check Flaaffy, such as Onix, Porygon, and specially defensive Gloom, pair well with Wartortle. If Wartortle lacks Refresh, Heal Bell users such as Mightyena, Delcatty, and Flaaffy make good partners. Flaaffy is especially worth noting, as it can threaten Water-types such as Tentacool, Wartortle, and Seaking. Toxic absorbers such as Gloom, Koffing, and Ariados also pair well with Wartortle. Ariados, Gloom, and Koffing are notable teammates, as they heavily appreciate Wartortle's ability to check Fire-types. Pokemon that can check Grass-type such as Doduo, Ponyta, Quilava, and Tropius, help Wartortle deal with threats like Gloom.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Wartortle's respectable Special Attack and access to Torrent allow it to function as a late-game sweeper and wallbreaker. Substitute increases Wartortle's chances of receiving boosts from both Torrent and Salac Berry. With a Torrent boost, Hydro Pump proves extremely hard to switch into for Pokemon that don't resist Water, with only specially defensive Noctowl not being 2HKOed. Hidden Power Grass threatens opposing Water-types such as Corsola, Seaking, and Wartortle. Rain Dance allows Wartortle to set rain for itself and any other teammates that may benefit, such as Seaking. Additionally, rain allows Wartortle's Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump to 2HKO Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't, such as specially defensive Noctowl and Swords Dance Tentacool. Rain Dance also allows Wartortle to stifle recovery from Synthesis and Moonlight users such as Gloom, Tropius, and Dustox. Ice Beam threatens Tropius and Gloom, which otherwise wall Wartortle. Wartortle's Speed investment, coupled with a Salac Berry boost, lets it outspeed the entire metagame, bar Voltorb, allowing it to sweep. Wartortle's HP investment ensures that it is left with 25% HP after three Substitutes. 12 Defense EVs ensure that Wartortle isn't KOed by Quick Attack from Ponyta or Volbeat when at 25% HP.</p> <p>This set functions best on rain and hyper offense teams. Other Pokemon that appreciate Rain Dance support, such as Seaking, Lombre, and Horsea, pair well with Wartortle. Seaking and Wartortle form a particularly powerful combination, as the two can weaken each other's checks, such as Noctowl, Castform, and Porygon. Other special attackers like Quilava, Flaaffy, and Voltorb similarly pair well with Wartortle. Voltorb is particularly worth noting because it can function as an excellent lead Rain Dance user, which allows Wartortle space to run Ice Beam. Physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Doduo, and Anorith are excellent partners, as they can weaken or heavily remove special walls like Noctowl and Porygon. Wartortle appreciates secondary setup sweepers and cleaners such as Beedrill, Anorith, and Ariados, as they allow it to be more flexible in deciding whether to wallbreak or sweep. Wartortle appreciates teammates like Lombre and Ariados that can threaten faster checks such as Voltorb.</p>"

The longer Blastoise lasts, the more time your other Pokemon have to find a hole in your opponent's team. You would probably use him like you would use your bulky Water-type in standard play.</p>",

The only way it will catch Jolteon is if you also have Earthquake, otherwise it'll just Substitute.

Earthquake hits aforementioned Electrics, but not very hard because Blastoise's Attack is average at best, and you probably don't want to stack it to keep your physical walling ability. Hidden Power Electric puts a dent in Mantine; Hidden Power Grass helps against Quagsire, but won't really come handy most of the time. Blastoise can Substitute and Focus Punch but it's not useful at all in UU.</p> <p>Haze and Roar work against Baton Passers and against Reversal / Flail Pokemon to an extent, but is not recommended in UU. Protect keeps Solrock from opening a hole in your team with Explosion and can work in conjunction with Counter or Mirror Coat to check what your opponent can do. Yawn is a fun move: lay down some Spikes beforehand for better results. Toxic is always fun to toy around with, you will be able to poison other Water types, and the standard Electric switches aren't fond of it either.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Blastoise needs max HP with plenty of Defense EVs. A Bold nature would help too. Blastoise tend to run around 200 Speed nowadays to get the first strike on Solrock and company before they Explode, and it's always nice to outrun those Sunnybeaming Grasses you will see in UU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn resists Surf and hits hard with STAB Electric attacks. Muk's high Special Defense makes it an easy switch in against non-Earthquake versions; Clefable and Slowking also give him trouble. Poliwrath is especially dangerous, because it has Water Absorb, and can Belly Drum on you, unless you have something strange like Hidden Power Grass, or use Roar / Haze.</p>",

While Blastoise can Toxic and Haze or Roar away Calm Mind boosts, Suicune's Pressure ability and repeated Calm Mind-boosted Surfs will be Blastoise's demise. Zapdos, Raikou, and Jolteon hurt Blastoise with STAB Thunderbolt, but they have a rather difficult time coming in on STAB Surf, or in Zapdos's case, a super effective Ice Beam. Blissey and Snorlax wall Blastoise to no end, as does Regice if Blastoise cannot Mirror Coat its Thunderbolt.

Sleep Powder's nigh-perfect accuracy allows Butterfree to put switch-ins or opposing leads to sleep, which makes them deadweight for most of the game. Psychic is Butterfree's strongest move, and thanks to the rarity of viable Dark- and Steel-types, it is almost drawback-free. Hidden Power Grass allows Butterfree to OHKO offensive Rhyhorn while also threatening Ground-types such as Cubone and Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Giga Drain is an option to provide Butterfree a form of recovery that helps complement Morning Sun's low PP, though it also has low PP and is weaker. Morning Sun provides Butterfree with reliable recovery and allows it to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Butterfree can opt to use Stun Spore alongside Sleep Powder in order to neuter faster threats such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Elekid. If Stun Spore is used over Morning Sun, Butterfree appreciates the limited recovery that Leftovers and Giga Drain provide.</p> <p>Butterfree fits best on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate the free turns that Sleep Powder provides. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Spoink, Seaking, and Chinchou, pair up nicely with Butterfree. Chinchou is worth noting due to its additional resistances to Ice and Electric. Its access to Thunder Wave means Butterfree's team can also spread status more easily. Wallbreakers such as Aipom, Castform, and Elekid all appreciate the opportunity to switch in on sleeping Pokemon. Aipom can act as an offensive pivot for Butterfree, as it threatens Butterfree's checks with Double-Edge and Brick Break. Likewise, Castform is worth mentioning, as it can tank special moves from Butterfree's checks and deal heavy damage in return. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, Cubone, and Spoink appreciate the setup opportunity that Sleep Powder and Stun Spore provides them. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn, Aron, Magnemite, and Nosepass can switch into the STAB moves of faster physical attackers that threaten Butterfree such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Aipom.</p>"

Namely, Mawile, Metang, Relicanth, and Sudowoodo all very effectively tank anything Pidgeot can throw at them and threaten it out with their STAB moves. Lairon gets a special mention for 4x resisting both Double-Edge and Aerial Ace, but it really needs to be careful of Hidden Power Ground. Physically defensive Sableye easily walls Pidgeot and can stall it out with Toxic and Recover. From there, generally physically bulky Pokemon like Piloswine and Pelipper can tank any attack from Pidgeot and KO it back, particularly if it damages itself with Double-Edge in the process. Finally, Pidgeot is relatively easy to revenge kill with both Plusle and Haunter, as well as Choice Band Raticate.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>With a Choice Band, Pidgeot's STAB Double-Edge hits like a bus, and due to Pidgeot's amazing Speed, it's one of the best revenge killers and late-game sweepers available in the tier. If your style is more conservative, Return is a decent STAB alternative to Double-Edge; however, the power drop is noticeable against defensive threats like physically defensive Lickitung, where Return will fail to 2HKO but Double-Edge has a 30% chance of doing so even without Spikes support (it is guaranteed with one layer of Spikes). Aerial Ace completely wrecks Hitmonchan and works well with Hidden Power Ground, which takes out the Rock- and Steel-types likely to switch into Pidgeot. Please note that Aerial Ace should only be used in situations where the recoil from using Double-Edge would be undesirable, as Aerial Ace hits at about half the strength of Double-Edge on neutral targets.</p> <p>Alternatively, Hidden Power Flying can be used over Aerial Ace, as it hits slightly harder and has a chance to OHKO defensive Bellossom after Spikes. However, if Hidden Power Flying is chosen, Steel Wing must be used in the third slot in order to provide coverage against Rock-types. This combination of moves should only be chosen if switching into Steel- and Rock-types is not an issue for Pidgeot's team. The last moveslot goes to Quick Attack, which is surprisingly strong when backed by STAB and Choice Band. It's useful for picking off weakened Plusle and can be used as a last resort against weather sweepers like Bellossom and Huntail.</p> <p>Jolly is the nature of choice to ensure Pidgeot can Speed tie against other Pidgeot and Murkrow. Dropping the Speed down by going with Adamant gives Pidgeot quite a bit more power, but being slower than other Pidgeot and Murkrow, not to mention getting outsped by base 90 Speed Pokemon, is just terrible.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used on this set to easily eliminate Graveler, Whiscash, and Relicanth; however, Hidden Power Ground is usually better for retaining the super effective hit on Magcargo and Mawile, among other threats. Spikes support is incredible when used with this set, as it pushes a ton of Pokemon into easy 2HKO range, particularly defensive threats like Lickitung and Swalot. What's more, nearly every defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Pidgeot is grounded, with Pelipper being about the only exception. Because of this, Roselia and Glalie are nearly necessary teammates to pair with Pidgeot.</p> <p>Pidgeot is a great check to the Grass-types of the tier, meaning Rock- and Water-types are good teammates to use with it. Loading on the Choice Band users is a good strategy when using Pidgeot, as very few teams can withstand that kind of onslaught, particularly if Pidgeot is used with its partner in crime, Murkrow, as well as other Normal-types like Vigoroth and Raticate. Finally, Plusle and Haunter have an easy time revenge killing Pidgeot, so something that can absorb Electric-type attacks is needed. Here again, Roselia is a good teammate, as are Ground-types like Whiscash, Graveler, and Piloswine.</p>"
        },
        "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
          "description": "<p>Pidgeot's greater bulk over Murkrow is put to work with this set. Even without any HP investment, Pidgeot's Substitute is never broken by defensive Tangela's Hidden Power Grass, which is something Murkrow can't accomplish even with maximum HP investment. Substitute is used to ease prediction, protect Pidgeot from status, and prevent revenge killers like Plusle and Haunter from accomplishing their mission. The ability to switch moves is the major reason why you would choose this set over Choice Band, as there are a number of Pokemon that can switch into any one of Pidgeot's moves, but few that are safe from them all.</p> <p>Return is used over Double-Edge to avoid recoil and make the most of Leftovers, Pidgeot's higher bulk, and its ability to stick around in a battle longer than Murkrow. Hidden Power Ground is a good move to ensure that Steel- and Rock-types can't just switch in and dominate Pidgeot, but Quick Attack is also a great move to ward off Plusle and other faster attackers like Raticate from just switching in willy-nilly. Finally, Aerial Ace is used as a secondary STAB attack, but it's very weak when not super effective. Therefore, Toxic is a good replacement; it's probably Pidgeot's best move for very bulky walls like Relicanth, and it's a good way to stall out dangerous threats like Huntail and Vigoroth.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to Speed tie with other Pidgeot and Murkrow and outrun Venomoth. However, Adamant is an option on this set thanks to Substitute protecting Pidgeot from being revenge killed, and it beefs up the power behind its STAB Return. Spikes support is incredible with this set, as it pushes many Pokemon into easy 2HKO range, particularly less defensive Steel-types like Mawile. Thanks to the lack of Choice Band, Spikes punishes common switch-ins even more, as Pidgeot can use Return as a drawback-free move and then follow up with a more appropriate attack.</p> <p>Pidgeot is a great check to Grass-types, meaning Rock- and Water-types are good teammates to use with it, particularly more immediately offensive Pokemon like Graveler and Seadra. Murkrow is another good offensive teammate to pair with this particular Pidgeot set, as Pidgeot can very effectively lure in targets like Mawile and Plusle and eliminate them with Hidden Power Ground from behind a Substitute, opening up an easy sweep for Murkrow later in the game.</p>"

    "ru": {"sets": {"Special Wallbreaker": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Pikachu stands out among the relatively small crowd of Electric-types as a strong, fast wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. This is largely due to Pikachu's exclusive item, Light Ball, which doubles its Special Attack, allowing it to break down defensive staples such as Dewgong and Sableye with ease. Furthermore, Pikachu has near-perfect coverage between STAB Thunderbolt and its variety of Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type coverage moves, essentially allowing it to take on any foe not faster than it, which is hard to come by because only a handful of a Pokemon exceed base 90 Speed. However, the immense amount of offensive pressure Pikachu puts on teams is counteracted by a complete and utter lack of any defensive utility. Pikachu cannot directly switch into anything due to extreme frailty, which makes it feel like playing a game with a Pokemon on your side already down: a huge disadvantage. For comparison, Pikachu's bulk is even less than that of Pokemon such as Zubat and Lotad. Pikachu also necessitates some team support, most notably in the form of Spikes from users such as Glalie and Cacturne, to help assist it in picking up KOs. The looming threat of Diglett also hampers Pikachu's offensive capabilities, as once Diglett is brought in, Pikachu is trapped, outsped, and revenge killed by Earthquake.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can lock foes such as Bulk Up Hitmonchan and Toxic Flareon into their non-attacking moves, which works great in tandem with Substitute, also allowing Pikachu the chance to utilize two attacks instead of just one. However, Encore also relies on prediction, even more so in the case of frail users such as Pikachu. Locking a foe into an actual attacking move will likely spell disaster for Pikachu. Encore is also incompatible with Surf, an extremely important coverage move Pikachu cannot afford to give up. Hidden Power Grass is another option that nails Whiscash, which would otherwise counter Pikachu. Volt Tackle is an immensely strong alternative to Thunderbolt, picking up several different KOs such as the guaranteed 2HKO on specially defensive Flareon after one layer of Spikes. However, Volt Tackle also causes Pikachu to take an enormous amount of recoil damage, meaning it can only get off about one or two Volt Tackles per game. Pikachu can opt to take out 60 Special Attack EVs and move them into Defense to survive Choice Band Hitmonchan's Mach Punch from full health. However, this lowers the damage output for all of Pikachu's attacks and therefore is not recommended. Pikachu's health is also already compromised by the use of Substitute for scouting.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Whiscash beats Pikachu variants not carrying Hidden Power Grass, which are extremely rare due to the sacrifice Pikachu would have to make matchup-wise against Grass-types such as Roselia and Bellossom. Bellossom and Roselia check variants of Pikachu by stomaching a Hidden Power Ice and revenge killing it with either the combination of Sunny Day and Solar Beam or just Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive walls such as Flareon and Kecleon can easily sponge hits from Pikachu and retaliate with Flamethrower and Body Slam, respectively. However, offensively pressuring Pikachu is considerably easier than defensively switching into and checking it. Diglett is able to trap Pikachu with no Substitute up after it picks something off and can revenge kill it with Earthquake, although it cannot safely switch into Pikachu directly. Faster attackers such as Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Yanma can outspeed and OHKO Pikachu. Furthermore, Pokemon that rely on Chlorophyll and Swift Swim to outspeed foes such as Bellossom and Huntail can outspeed Pikachu under the duration of the required weather. Priority move users such as Mach Punch Hitmonchan and Quick Attack Raticate can severely cripple or outright KO Pikachu due to its paper-thin defenses. Knock Off users such as Sableye can remove Pikachu's Light Ball, turning what was once an overwhelming offensive threat into an extremely passive Pokemon that one of Sableye's teammates can capitalize on.</p>",

        "All-Out Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Thunderbolt is Pikachu's strongest attack, super effectively hitting Pokemon such as Dewgong, Pelipper, and Pidgeot while neutrally nailing Pokemon such as Sableye and Mawile. Surf is Pikachu's strongest option against Electric-types such as Plusle and the majority of Ground-types such as Piloswine, Graveler, and Pupitar. Substitute shields Pikachu from status and is the only form of protection Pikachu really has due to its paper-thin defenses. Successfully setting up a Substitute allows Pikachu to scout the opponent. Hidden Power Ice covers for Grass-types such as Bellossom and Roselia that resist the combination of Thunderbolt and Surf, rounding out Pikachu's near-perfect neutral coverage.</p> <p>Pikachu has extremely low defenses and therefore should not directly switch into anything. Instead, Pikachu should utilize slow Baton Pass support from Pokemon such as Flareon and Mawile or wait until a teammate faints. If it is predicted for the foe to use a non-attacking move or switch out themselves, Pikachu should use Substitute. Pikachu shouldn't worry about lowering its own HP this way, as it is already going to faint to just about any neutral hit. One of Pikachu's biggest threats is Diglett, which outspeeds Pikachu, traps it with Arena Trap, and KOes it with Earthquake. Use Substitute to scout for Ground-type switch-ins such as Diglett and Whiscash as they potentially come in. Grass-types such as Tangela, Cacturne, and Bellossom can check Whiscash for Pikachu, one of its most reliable switch-ins. Pikachu appreciates Spikes support from users such as Glalie and Cacturne, as the chip damage can assist Pikachu in breaking down walls and cleaning later in the game. Physical wallbreakers such as Hitmonchan and Sudowoodo can help demolish specially defensive walls that give Pikachu trouble such as Kecleon, Lickitung, and Flareon. Pikachu's above average Speed tier is considerably helpful for offensive teams, as it ensures Pikachu outspeeds a plethora of threats to clean late-game without needing much additional team support.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Can be a threat to standard teams if your opponent doesn't happen to have Celebi, as it hits about any standard wall quite hard.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thief can grab Leftovers from Blissey and Snorlax. Charm can be annoying for Curselax and Swampert. Volt Tackle can give you some extra power, but it can't be used with Surf.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>233 Attack with Focus Punch to 2HKO Blissey in standard. 299 makes you tie with most Salamence for Speed, and 328 makes you faster than stuff like Modest Gengar and the like. Put leftover EVs in Special Attack. When not using Focus Punch, just make sure to max Special Attack for maximal sweeping power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard, Venusaur and Celebi can come in easily on Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, Surf and Focus Punch, taking nil damage thanks to Leftovers and Recover, Leech Seed and / or Synthesis. Even Hidden Power Ice doesn't do that much. Dusclops with around 360 Special Defense can take quite a few Thunderbolts from Raichu if it can Pain Split or Rest in time, and is immune to Focus Punch, while Hidden Powers and Surf don't do much damage. Blissey, Snorlax and Regice must avoid Focus Punch at all costs, so they cannot come in effectively on a Substitute Raichu either, but the rest of its moves don't do much at all. Snorlax might even be able to come in on Substitute and Curse up and come out on top, but beware of Raichu using Encore.</p> <p>Grounds can be used for countering Raichu to an extent. Flygon needs to beware of Hidden Power Ice, and doesn't take Focus Punches too lightly (especially if Flygon is Choice Banded and thus lacks Leftovers recovery), but makes an excellent counter nonetheless because of a guaranteed OHKO with its STAB Earthquake. Claydol is immune to Thunderbolt and resists Focus Punch, but is 3HKOed by Surf and almost 4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass or Ice. It is hard for Raichu to get around Claydol though, since Raichu will have to predict it switching in every time. Donphan is easier to beat but is still a hindrance; it takes nearly no damage from Focus Punch thanks to its high Defense, but Surf and Hidden Power will 2HKO him. Swampert is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass, but every other attack does absolutely nothing to it.</p> <p>In UnderUsed, Camerupt can be almost completely disregarded as a counter because of Surf. Vileplume and Meganium, much like Venusaur and Celebi, take nearly no damage from Focus Punch and Thunderbolt and can shrug it off with Leech Seed and Synthesis. They should watch out a little more for Hidden Power Ice, though. Quagsire and Whiscash do the same job as Swampert: countering any variant not using Hidden Power Grass with no trouble at all. That's why Vileplume or Meganium combined with Quagsire or Whiscash walls any Raichu available. Sandslash and Gligar do the same as Donphan here: being 2HKOed by Surf (and in Sandslash' case, Hidden Power) doesn't cut it, but easily take Focus Punch and Thunderbolt for breakfast. Hypno and Grumpig, the standard special walls of UU, do quite nicely at taking anything Raichu throws at them, though Grumpig has no Wish like Hypno does, so it will get worn down quickly. A sweeping Grumpig doesn't like to get Thunder Waved either.</p> <p>In general, attacking Raichu straight on is a good idea if it doesn't OHKO you. It's very fragile and weak to the most common attacking move in the game (Earthquake), and it often uses Substitute to see what you're going to do. Just switching out if it comes in on your non-attacking move is handy as well, since it is probably going to use Encore.</p>",

In standard, play it as follows: come in on a non-attacking move coming from a slower Pokemon and Encore it, then predict what your opponent is going to do. If Blissey, Snorlax or Regice are coming in, Focus Punch on the switch. If you think Swampert is coming, Hidden Power Grass it on the switch--it will not OHKO though. If you're insecure about prediction, use Substitute after Encoring, and handle from there. However, it's recommended to use Hidden Power Grass if your skills allow it, because Swampert is on nearly every team and it greatly hinders Raichu's sweeping potential.</p> <p>For UU play, Focus Punch probably won't come handy, as Thunderbolt will 2HKO Aggron and Clefable is rare, and not much else weak to Fighting is around, besides Golem who you can OHKO with Hidden Power Grass. Therefore, the EVs suggested are for standard play. A guaranteed 2HKO on Blissey with Focus Punch, and enough Speed to outspeed all Heracross.</p>"

Surf is the main reason to use it over Manectric, because it 2HKOs Gligar and OHKOs Camerupt. Only use Hidden Power Ice in standard for Flygon and Salamence (usually doesn't OHKO), because you need Hidden Power Grass in UU for Quagsire. Like with the first set, if you smell a standard Special wall coming, Focus Punch it.</p> <p>When using Focus Punch, use the EVs suggested on the first set. Otherwise, use these. Timid Raichu ties with Jolly Fearow, Dodrio, Linoone and anything else with 100 base Speed and a +Speed nature. Modest ties with the same Pokemon, except with Adamant versions. You'll usually outspeed Salamence as well as the rare Charizard. Use the IVs suggested when using Hidden Power Ice in standard, having absolute max Speed is important.</p>"},

However, Nidoqueen is much better at using Counter due to higher sturdiness.

Charm can be annoying as hell for physical switch-ins like Fearow, Snorlax or any Ground. Roar Nidoqueen can be used for teams based around Baton Pass and it can easily Roar away Ninjask or Scizor as well. Nidoqueen is defensive enough to pull off a Rest / Sleep Talk set, but it's better to use her outstanding versatility. Substitute helps against Weezing if it's not running Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes SwaQuagsire and Whiscash, but you should be using it on the switch or they will KO you with Earthquake, Surf or Hydro Pump. Use Crunch if you're using a Nidoqueen that's focused on Special Attack (though that's not recommended as it lacks STAB); it will damage Solrock and Misdreavus badly.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you want to OHKO max HP Gligar with Ice Beam guaranteed, you need 200 Special Attack. The main sets should have offensive spreads like suggested, but if you're using Counter or just want a more sturdy Nidoqueen, I recommend using 252 HP / 140 Attack / 36 Defense / 80 Speed with Adamant nature (when not using any special attacks). With this, you survive STAB Earthquakes from the likes of Sandslash. This means you'll be easily living through Nidoking, non-Swords Danced Gligar and any non-STAB Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Nidoqueen is versatile, but since its attacking stats are on the low side it doesn't hurt much if it's not dealing STAB or super effective damage.</p> <p>It's mostly Waters and Grounds that Nidoqueen fears. Politoed, Slowking, and Blastoise take on non-Choice Banded Nidoqueen easily, though they may get worn down after a while.

Poliwrath usually doesn't run Earthquake or a Water move, but if it does it's a good Nidoqueen counter as well.</p> <p>Sandslash takes Ice Beam even worse than Donphan does, so it's only good as an early game counter that shouldn't switch into Ice Beam, and preferably not into Earthquakes either. Watch out for Sludge Bomb's Poison chance, too, as well as the rare Hidden Power Grass. Gligar can come in with some prediction to avoid Ice Beam, but it cannot OHKO Nidoqueen with Earthquake when Nidoqueen is at (near) full health, so just use it as a finisher. It will get OHKOed by most Ice Beaming Nidoqueen. Solrock, Misdreavus and Lunatone are immune to Earthquake and resist Sludge Bomb, so as long as they don't eat a Shadow Ball they're good counters. Solrock can even set up a Reflect to avoid too much damage. Solrock can Earthquake Nidoqueen (watch out for Counter), Misdreavus can Perish Trap or Calm Mind up, Lunatone can Calm Mind up and use Ice Beam / Psychic.</p>",

Nidoqueen is defensive enough to pull off a RestTalk set, but it's better to capitalize on her outstanding versatility. Substitute helps against Weezing if it's not running Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p>Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying are options to destroy Heracross; in the same vein, Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Swampert. However, Nidoqueen must hit it on the switch or be KOed by one of Swampert's STAB moves. Crunch is an option for a specially based Nidoqueen to damage Gengar, but note that such a set is not recommended as it lacks STAB. Double Kick makes Nidoqueen a good Tyraniboah counter as it breaks Tyranitar's Substitute and damages it in the same turn; furthermore, Nidoqueen resists Focus Punch and is immune to Thunderbolt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Milotic, Slowbro, and Swampert, are failsafe switch-ins. Their high HP and Defense stats enable them to easily switch in on even Thunderbolt and Choice Band Earthquake. Swampert has more trouble with Hidden Power Grass variants, however. Nonetheless, all of the aforementioned Pokemon pack super effective STAB moves to take down Nidoqueen. Weezing is a good counter to Nidoqueen: in addition to possessing a high Defense stat, it is immune to Earthquake, resists Focus Punch, Superpower, and Sludge Bomb, and packs Will-O-Wisp to further lower Nidoqueen's attacking power. Substitute variants can be a hindrance, however, as Substitute protects Nidoqueen from Will-O-Wisp, and Nidoqueen's Substitutes survive one Sludge Bomb. While Focus Punch will put a dent in it, Skarmory takes most of Nidoqueen's physical attacks easily, thanks especially to its immunities to Sludge Bomb and Earthquake. As long as Nidoqueen doesn't pack a Fire or an Electric move, Skarmory can easily lay Spikes, phaze Nidoqueen away for some token damage, or wear it down with Drill Peck. Forretress isn't as easily killed by Thunderbolt or Thunder, but is OHKOed by Fire Blast. However, it can damage Nidoqueen more easily with super effective Earthquake, so it's something to watch out for.</p> <p>Flygon can come in on Earthquake, Rock Slide, Sludge Bomb, as well as Fire and Electric moves; in fact, it only really has to watch out for Ice Beam, which might not always OHKO. In return, it can badly damage Nidoqueen with Earthquake, which OHKOes if Flygon is equipped with a Choice Band. However, a fully defensive Nidoqueen can survive non-Choice Band Flygon's Earthquake and KO it with Counter. Specially defensive Claydol barely takes 30% from Ice Beam, and can eliminate Nidoqueen with an Ice Beam of its own. It also packs STAB Earthquake, but must watch out for Counter variants. Donphan is 2HKOed by Ice Beam and weakened variants should therefore not switch into Nidoqueen, but aside from that, it makes a nice counter due to its high Defense.</p> <p>Celebi resists Earthquake, but is weak to Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb. Nonetheless, it can shrug off most non-Choice Band-boosted attacks, especially with Recover, and hit Nidoqueen hard with STAB Psychic. Finally, Dugtrio can come in on Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, or Sludge Bomb, on a double switch, or after a kill, and proceed to OHKO Nidoqueen with STAB Choice Band Earthquake.</p>",

  "Nidoking": {

He can always surprise you and kill one of the key elements of your team. However, he can be rather hard to bring in due to his common weaknesses to Surf, Ice Beam, Psychic, and Earthquake, and will always have a problem taking down sturdy Water-types.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoking can use Counter on Choice Banders like Fearow, on walls like Solrock or even on Grounds like Quagsire and Sandslash. It does work nicely, but Nidoking is usually better off at attacking straight up. Toxic and Thief can help in wearing down opponents, but once again Nidoking is better off ramming things instead of stalling them out.</p> <p>Thunder does more damage to Waters than Thunderbolt if it hits and it has a high Paralysis chance, but in the long run Thunderbolt's accuracy is better. Roar can help you against UU Baton Passers, but those are rare. Hidden Power Grass is fun on Nidoking to hit Quagsire for a surprise.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk are always a nice option on Pokemon that can take a hit or two. Nidoking can absorb a Sleep from a Grass-type nicely and then surprise them with Sludge Bomb, but it does hurt his great versatility. Protect is nice to scout for Earthquakes, Explosions, and Choice Banded moves, and helps for Leftovers recovery.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're using Counter on Nidoking, more defensive EVs are suggested. With 88 HP and 28 Defense EVs, you can survive a Gligar Earthquake (as long as he doesn't have an Adamant nature). Nidoking needs 200 Special Attack (the stat, not the amount of EVs) to OHKO Gligar. If you're using a -Special Attack nature (Adamant, for example), you need 68 EVs to reach that. However, without that, Nidoking already has 206 Special Attack, so there's no need to stack it any more. Generally you'll want to focus on Attack to put a little strength behind his Earthquakes, while his Special moves should be designed to kill specific threats like Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your options are limited. Quagsire, Whiscash, Politoed, Poliwrath, Walrein, and Blastoise work as counters in the same way as the Waters from standard: they do not like Choice Band Earthquakes, and Quagsire and Whiscash do not like Hidden Power Grass, but they take the hits from any of his other moves rather well. Poliwrath, Whiscash, and Quagsire may be better off using Earthquake instead of Surf or Hydro Pump to counter Nidoking.</p> <p>Solrock and Lunatone should beware of Megahorn or Shadow Ball, and Grounds like Sandslash and Gligar cannot take Ice Beam, but if these moves are not present they are great counters.</p>",

Earthquake should take care of Quagsire and other Water friends in 2 or 3 hits, Megahorn kills Solrock and Lunatone and puts quite a big hurting into Meganium, and Rock Slide is for Fliers like Fearow and Scyther.

There are very few surefire counters to Nidoking, as it can always surprise you and KO one of the key elements of your team. However, it can be rather hard to bring in due to its common weaknesses to Surf and Earthquake, and it will always have problems taking down sturdy Water-types.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can take down Choice Band users, walls, and even Ground-types. While it is effective, Nidoking is usually better off straight-up attacking. Double Kick is a novelty move, but is notable for allowing Nidoking to entirely destroy Tyraniboah. Not only does Double Kick let Nidoking both break Tyranitar's Substitute and damage it, Nidoking also resists Focus Punch and is immune to Thunderbolt. Thunder does more damage to Water-types than Thunderbolt does, and has a higher paralysis chance to boot, but Thunderbolt's greater accuracy is preferred. Nidoking can use Roar to phaze away Scizor and Ninjask, as well as Zapdos and Jolteon that lack Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Grass is an interesting option to hit Swampert.</p> <p>Toxic and Thief can help wear down opponents, but once again, Nidoking is better off smashing in its opponents' faces instead of stalling them out. Rest + Sleep Talk is, as always, a nice combination on Pokemon that can take a hit or two. Nidoking can absorb sleep from Grass-types and surprise them with Sludge Bomb, but the loss of two moveslots does hurt his great versatility. Protect can be used to scout for Earthquake and Explosion, to reduce prediction against Choice Band users, and to gain some Leftovers recovery. Substitute can be used in combination with a powerful special move such as Fire Blast or Thunder to help Nidoking dispose of Weezing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune and Milotic can switch in on anything except Choice Band Earthquake as they shrug off even Thunderbolt, and then dispose of Nidoking with Surf. Swampert is further immune to Thunderbolt and packs STAB Earthquake, but it must watch out for Hidden Power Grass. Weezing makes an all-around good counter as it resists Sludge Bomb and Megahorn, is immune to Earthquake, and takes little damage from Rock Slide thanks to its high Defense. Aside from using Will-O-Wisp on Nidoking and wearing it down with Sludge Bomb, Weezing can also use Pain Split to restore HP. However, watch out for Substitute, which will block Will-O-Wisp, as well as special attack such as Fire Blast and Thunder. Skarmory can wall Nidoking and set up Spikes on it if Nidoking lacks a Fire or Electric move. Much the same goes for Forretress; while it lacks an Earthquake immunity, it is not weak to Electric, and its own Earthquake 2HKOes Nidoking.</p> <p>Flygon's typing and ability allow it to switch in on all of Earthquake, Rock Slide, Sludge Bomb, and Thunderbolt; it can then OHKO Nidoking with STAB Earthquake. However, it takes huge damage from Ice Beam and Choice Band Megahorn. Claydol can better sponge Ice Beam, but is slower and takes even more damage from Megahorn. Donphan's high Defense makes it an ideal counter to physical sets; however, Ice Beam will take out about half its health. Celebi can destroy Nidoking with Psychic, but it is OHKOed by Choice Band Megahorn and 2HKOed by non-Choice Band Megahorn and Sludge Bomb, so make sure to switch it in safely.</p>",

Earthquake dents Metagross, and will also be Nidoking's best bet against Water-types if it picks Fire Blast in the third moveslot. Both slashed third moves 2HKO Skarmory; in addition, Thunderbolt hits Water-types, especially Gyarados, while Fire Blast has more power and eliminates Forretress and Steelix. Generally, Thunderbolt offers more versatility. Ice Beam beats Donphan and Salamence, and does good damage to Grass-types such as Breloom and Sceptile as well if you don't want to risk Megahorn's subpar accuracy.</p>"},

Even if you aren't able to find an opportunity to use Belly Drum, you can still get some random Attack boosts by using Meteor Mash if you picked that. Cosmic Power is an option as well to make this set more tankish: basically you Cosmic Power until you're not taking much damage from the opponent, use Soft-Boiled to recover the damage, Belly Drum up, and start hitting things.

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charm greatly hinders Curse Snorlax and Swampert, and to a lesser extent Dragon Dance users as well. Fire Blast is a more powerful but less accurate option over Flamethrower. Hidden Power Grass puts a big dent into Swampert and also hurts Tyranitar; you might want to use Magical Leaf if you're afraid of Counter. Psychic dents Fighting-types, but Medicham and Heracross are neutral to it, and the latter takes more damage from Fire moves. Reflect is a great move to support your team with, and can work in tandem with Counter. Safeguard is another team support move, but is less useful. Sing can quickly incapacitate your opponent's Clefable counter and let Clefable set up Calm Mind or Belly Drum. Snatch, though a novelty move, can get Clefable a Substitute, Calm Mind, Recover, Soft-Boiled, Aromatherapy, or Dragon Dance if you're good at predicting. Wish can be used over Soft-Boiled most of the time; Clefable is an above-average Wish user. It might be wise to use Protect as well, as it can scout Choice Band users, stall for Leftovers recovery, and protect Clefable from Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Clefable is difficult to counter due to its versatility and access to Sing; you'll usually have to use a combination of Pokemon to beat it. The good news, though, is that it's relatively uncommon.</p> <p>Swampert walls most sets that don't use Hidden Power Grass or Magical Leaf. It can hit Clefable hard with Earthquake, but defensive variants can shrug it off with Soft-Boiled. Alternatively, Swampert can try to Curse up against it, but watch out for Encore, or worse, Counter. Milotic and Suicune can somewhat wall Clefable, but can't pose much of an offensive threat. If Clefable has Soft-Boiled, all they can do is poison it with Toxic, or in Milotic's case, put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Mirror Coat might work as well on Thunderbolt Clefable. Suicune can set up Calm Mind boosts and Roar Clefable away unless Clefable is running Encore; the Psych Up set, however, is Suicune's greatest nightmare. If Clefable doesn't have Thunderbolt or doesn't cause paralysis on the switch, Taunt Gyarados is a great counter. Zapdos can put a hurting on non-specially defensive Clefable.</p> <p>Jirachi can comfortably set up Calm Mind on Clefable while staying healthy with Wish, as it resists most of Clefable's moves, is immune to Toxic, and can even make 101 HP Substitutes. In fact, it only really fears switching into Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Choice Band Focus Punch, and Encore messes it up as well. Celebi functions similarly but is slightly inferior, as it is weak to Ice Beam and doesn't pack as many useful resistances to Choice Band or Belly Drum Clefable's moves. Leech Seed or Calm Mind Psychic takes care of Clefable quite easily, however. Additionally, Celebi can shrug off Thunder Wave and Toxic with Natural Cure.</p> <p>Metagross takes diddly squat from any Clefable lacking Fire Blast or Flamethrower, but it doesn't enjoy being paralyzed by Thunder Wave or Body Slam, and will lose to Counter variants. Tyranitar can eliminate Clefable with Focus Punch, or boost with Dragon Dance and use Rock Slide. However, it is picked off by Brick Break or Focus Punch, hates paralysis, is troubled by Counter if Clefable actually lives to use it, and disrupted by Charm if it cannot Substitute or Taunt in time. Heracross must avoid a Fire attack, but can otherwise easily switch in on Clefable and OHKO it with Choice Band Brick Break or Focus Punch. It absorbs paralysis nicely, though, and even sleep if it has Sleep Talk. Just don't attack Clefable until you know it won't Counter, and avoid Charm as well. Machamp is in the same boat, except with Cross Chop. Medicham can OHKO Clefable as well, but has more problems dealing with paralysis or damaging attacks in general.</p> <p>Any Pokemon with Rest stalls out the Toxic stall set. Steel- and Poison-types work as well, though they should beware of Fire moves. Generally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It will often have to use Soft-Boiled, so use that to switch in a Pokemon safely.</p>",

Its insane movepool does mean it has a couple perks over them, but its subpar stats mean most of the time it won't be worth it. If you do want to use Wigglytuff, you really have to make sure you make use of that sprawling movepool. This does make it a bit unpredictable, meaning it's possible to bluff certain moves and get your opponent to misplay around it, and its stats are just good enough to mean your opponent can't afford to do that. Or you can hope they get lost in those big, baby-doll eyes. Either way.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As stated before, Wigglytuff's movepool is pretty extensive, opening up various moveset options not listed above. The sets given above are what Wigglytuff has over its competition, namely Lickitung and Kecleon. That said, Wigglytuff is able to run other sets to success, just be sure they're not done better by said competition. The big draw to Wigglytuff's learnset is its access to a plethora of special moves, but its physical movepool is actually pretty decent as well, and its Attack is only marginally lower than its Special Attack. A Choice Band set with Double-Edge / Brick Break / Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Ground can leave a large dent in the specially defensive Pokemon that are most likely to switch into Wigglytuff, particularly OHKOing Hitmonchan and Flareon and doing upwards of 80% to maximum HP Lickitung with Double-Edge. A SubPunch set is doable, as Wigglytuff's Substitutes are massive, meaning it can really take advantage of defensive Pokemon that rely on Seismic Toss for damage, in particular Sableye and Lickitung.</p> <p>Wigglytuff is one of the few Pokemon with access to Perish Song in NU, and it is probably the best user of it after Dewgong, giving it a bit of a niche on teams that need a stallbreaker. Wigglytuff's signature move Sing is somewhat viable, as sleep-inducing moves are pretty uncommon in NU, and can be paired with Nightmare for some shenanigans, but it's pretty unreliable in the long run due to its accuracy. Seismic Toss is perfectly viable on any set for consistent damage; however, it ignores Wigglytuff's usable attacking stats, and if not using them, you're probably better off using Lickitung.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Thanks to Hitmonchan's good special bulk and ability to OHKO even maximum Defense Wigglytuff, it's probably the overall best switch-in to Wigglytuff as long as it avoids Thunder Wave and Body Slam. Apart from that, it's best to avoid aiming physical attacks at Wigglytuff unless you're sure you can OHKO it from whatever health it's at, lest you risk the chance of eating a Counter in return. Strong special attackers like Huntail can cleave right through Wigglytuff's bulk without the risk of Counter, and bulky special attackers like Chimecho can take full advantage of Wigglytuff by using it as setup bait. Apart from that, it's hard to list any true counters to Wigglytuff, as its movepool is pretty dangerous and most of the time Wigglytuff is going to be in a support role. In general, it's best to scout out Wigglytuff's moveset a bit before switching in something too hastily, but Rock- and Steel-types make for decent safe switch-ins, as Wigglytuff will rarely be running anything to hit them for much damage, they resist its STAB attacks, most don't mind being paralyzed, and they have good enough bulk to survive a hit should Wigglytuff be carrying something specifically for them.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Counter": {
          "description": "<p>Wigglytuff's horrid defenses, low Speed, and massive HP stat create the perfect conditions for Wigglytuff to eat attacks and make use of Counter. Thanks to that gargantuan HP, nearly every attack Wigglytuff Counters is going to KO the foe right back. Luckily for Wigglytuff, while its horrid defenses mean it's usually 2HKOed by most Choice Band-boosted STAB moves, it usually isn't OHKOed unless it's a Fighting-type move, further increasing the use of Counter considering the large number of non-Fighting-type Choice Band users in the tier, including Graveler, Relicanth, and Pidgeot.</p> <p>Wish and Protect allow Wigglytuff to survive throughout the match, support the team, and possibly even use Counter more than once. Protect also allows it to scout the moves of Choice Band attackers and react accordingly. Return is for a reliable STAB attack; however, Toxic can be used, as Wigglytuff is going to be utterly walled by Haunter and Steel-types anyway, and Wigglytuff can provide a defensive role by using Toxic to stall out certain weak attackers like Sableye and defensive Flareon.</p> <p>An Impish nature ensures Wigglytuff can survive as many physical moves as possible and be able to hit back with Counter. With max HP investment, Wigglytuff's Counter is going to one-shot pretty much anything that doesn't OHKO it. While typically it would be better to invest in both defenses and leave Wigglytuff's HP alone, which will increase Wigglytuff's overall bulk significantly, investing fully in HP actually increases Wigglytuff's physical bulk significantly enough to allow it to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Sudowoodo's Double-Edge where it wouldn't otherwise.</p> <p>If you check Wigglytuff's learnset, you'll notice how you can scroll for quite a while before reaching the bottom. There are a ton of moves that can be used in place of any of Wish, Protect, or the last slot depending on your team and what you want Wigglytuff to accomplish. Some good choices include strong damaging moves like Fire Blast, Blizzard, Focus Punch, Psychic, and Thunder to make use of Wigglytuff's decent attacking stats, a consistent move like Seismic Toss, support options like Safeguard, Reflect, Light Screen, Sunny Day, and Rain Dance, and other niche moves like Perish Song.</p> <p>Having a switch-in to Hitmonchan's Fighting-type attacks is needed for this set to be successful, making Swalot and Pelipper good teammates. Really strong special attackers like Rain Dance Huntail just shred right through Wigglytuff, meaning dedicated special walls like Kecleon and Dewgong should be considered, and both appreciate the healing that Wish can provide. Wigglytuff can usually scare off physical attackers with the threat of Counter, making Spikes paired with it extra effective, and Roselia makes a naturally good partner to it. All that said, Wigglytuff actually fits quite well on heavy offense teams as a lure to blow back certain physical attackers, heal a teammate with Wish, and open the opponent's team a bit to aid in a teammate's sweep.</p>"

Safeguard is a neat alternate option to Wish that's uncommon in NU and ensures that Wigglytuff's teammate can't be stricken with status. Although it's kind of hard to set up both a screen (or both screens if you're crazy) and Safeguard all in one go, it can ensure the perfect setup conditions for a frailer sweeper that doesn't want to worry about status ruining its sweep, such as Swords Dance Kingler or Dragon Dance Pupitar. Thunder Wave and Body Slam are used to spread paralysis on the opponent's team to make sweeping easier for a teammate. While Wigglytuff is slightly outclassed by Metang with this set, as Metang has Explosion to get off the field quickly, Wigglytuff's higher special bulk and access to Wish and paralysis-inducing moves make it a decent alternative.</p> <p>The EV spread provided best allows Wigglytuff to set up a screen and use Wish before being KOed. Maximum Speed can be run to allow Wigglytuff to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible to better ensure it can get a screen up before going down. Protect can be used in the last slot with Wish to increase Wigglytuff's longevity and allow it to survive throughout the course of the match, but that creates a situation in which it's totally dead weight outside of providing screen support, which is not at all desirable in most cases.</p> <p>As Wigglytuff is in a complete support role with this set, it shouldn't be the focus of a team. It won't do much in the way of filling team weaknesses and at most will only softly check some weaker attackers. Instead, it should be chosen as a way to try to guarantee a sweep with another Pokemon. Setup sweepers are a must to be paired with this set, meaning Swords Dance Mawile, Dragon Dance Pupitar, Rain Dance Huntail, and Sunny Day Bellossom are all ideal teammates. Wigglytuff tends to lure in Hitmonchan, so Pokemon that can take advantage of its Fighting-type moves, such as Venomoth, Haunter, and Chimecho, are also great teammates.</p>"

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Wigglytuff has an absolutely massive special movepool, and it has a just high enough Special Attack stat to make a set worth using, particularly since its Special Attack is something that separates it from the other Normal-types in the tier. With this set, Wigglytuff acts as a decent wallbreaker, opening the opponent's team up to a special sweeper like Huntail later in the match. Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Fire Blast get incredible coverage in just three slots, hitting every Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage at worst. Thanks to this coverage, the last slot is open to a lot of moves, with Wish allowing Wigglytuff to provide team support or help itself, though it's hard to use without Protect. Fake Tears makes Wigglytuff's attacks actually pretty terrifyingly strong, usually forcing the opponent to switch and increasing the damage output to the opponent's team. Finally, Psychic can be used to nail Hitmonchan on the switch, and it is a nice way to more easily take out Swalot and Haunter.</p> <p>Wigglytuff needs all the power it can get from a Modest nature, since base 75 Special Attack isn't overly impressive and the goal with this set is to punch holes in the opposing team. Maximum Speed is needed to outspeed as many defensive Pokemon as possible, as this set's main merit comes from surprising opponents who would normally be expecting a more defensive set. Blizzard and Thunder can be used for the sheer damage output they provide, but Wigglytuff gets enough mileage out of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt as it is, making the accuracy of the former two undesirable. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for more accuracy, but Fire Blast is accurate enough compared to Blizzard and Thunder, and the extra power can come in handy against certain threats like Roselia, as Fire Blast guarantees a 2HKO against it where Flamethrower just misses out.</p> <p>As for other move alternatives, a vast array of Hidden Powers can be used in the last slot to complete coverage on certain targets, such as Hidden Power Dark for Chimecho, Hidden Power Water for Fire-types, and Hidden Power Grass for Whiscash. Focus Punch can be used to get a surprise hit on Kecleon and Lickitung looking to switch in and absorb its special hits, further helping a sweeper like Huntail later in the game. If using Focus Punch, be sure to change the nature to Rash. Toxic is also a decent option to cripple special walls with recovery in extended matches.</p> <p>Wigglytuff is extremely vulnerable to Hitmonchan if not running Psychic, making Chimecho, Haunter, and Pelipper great teammates to take advantage of the Fighting-type moves it'll be firing off. As Wigglytuff is actually rather frail without any defensive investment, most other faster, strong attackers are threats to this set, making sturdy, defensive Pokemon good teammates in general. Relicanth, Kecleon, and Lickitung can all provide a decent defensive backbone to support Wigglytuff. Pokemon that can make use of the surprise holes that Wigglytuff punches are great teammates as well, particularly special sweepers like Huntail and Calm Mind Sableye.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>A good UU Pokemon. It walls the hell out of Meganium (don't Sludge Bomb before you check for Counter though), can paralyze opponents or put them to sleep, supports with Aromatherapy and Leech Seed or sweeps with SunnyBeam. Like many other Grass- and Poison-types, however, it gets walled very easily, both in UU and in standard. Still, a good counter to Electric-, Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types, depending on EVs.</p> <p>Vileplume should only be used outside of UU with the Aromatherapy set, otherwise special versions are inferior to Exeggutor, and physical versions wish they could be Victreebel.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore is cool if you can catch some fast Flier like Fearow or Salamence on the switch. Toxic is another status affliction Vileplume can deal out; it'll ruin Hypno, who relies on Wish to recover. It works wonders on Milotic and Suicune in standard too, the former losing stall potential, the latter being forced to Rest. Hidden Power Ghost is an alternative physical attack for Swords Dancing Vileplume.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>On the Sunny Day set, since it should only be used in UU, you don't need to worry about being faster than threats like Aerodactyl and Jolteon, so you have a few options here. You can opt to be faster than Electrode (which rarely, if ever, uses a +Speed nature, and it's already rare to begin with), which requires a stat of 190 before Sunny Day (giving 380 after), or 216 EVs. The next breakpoint would be +Speed Persian and Sneasel (also rare) which needs 180 EVs to get a stat of 181. The slowest you should go would be 136 Speed EVs, giving a stat of 170, as this is faster than Timid Manectric and Electabuzz after Sunny Day. Whatever you decide, max out Special Attack with Modest, and put the rest into HP or a defense.</p> <p>On the sweeping sets, you should max the attacking stat you're using, as suggested. The last set should always have max HP, and be mostly focused on one of the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard, without Hidden Power Fire, Metagross, Forretress, Skarmory and other Steels laugh at Vileplume, except if they get Sleep Powdered. Heracross doesn't take much from anything Vileplume does, even Hidden Power Fire. Guts makes it ideal to absorb Stun Spore, and if it has Sleep Talk, then Sleep Powder as well. Dodrio, Salamence, Gyarados and other Fliers hit Vileplume hard with STAB Flying moves, but do not enjoy Stun Spore (due to the speed loss) or Sludge Bomb (because of poison chance and damage). Hidden Power Ice surprises some Fliers pretty well, too.</p> <p>In UU, Muk walls anything Vileplume throws at it, even the Sunnybeam set doesn't do much damage, and if Muk has Fire Blast Vileplume will be dead in two hits. Fearow hates Stun Spore, Hidden Power Ice and Sludge Bomb, but can come in on a Grass move easily and use Choice Banded Drill Peck, which OHKOs Vileplume. Sets without Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ice / Fire will get walled by Jumpluff and other Grassers, while any set without a Grass attack has some trouble with Waters with Ice Beam as well as Ground-types. Without Hidden Power Fire, Vileplume is a sitting duck against any Steel.</p>",

Start disabling your counters by wearing them down with Hidden Power or putting one of them to Sleep with Sleep Powder. You will likely want to wait with using Sunny Day when you can OHKO most things your opponent has left, or if you can beat them one on one without dying the process. When the time is right, use Sunny Day to double speed, power up Hidden Power Fire and turn Solar Beam into a one-turn attack. Hidden Power Fire gets rid of Steels like Metagross and Skarmory in two shots, Salamence will nearly always die to one Hidden Power Ice. In UU play, Solar Beam already puts a big dent in Gligar (the only thing really worth using Hidden Power Ice for), so you'll probably want to use Hidden Power Fire for other Grassers like Meganium.</p> <p>Paralysis negates your speed boost, making sweeping practically impossible, so that's why Lum Berry is an option. Leftovers is generally the better choice though, because it often means difference between life and death.</p>"

If you're doing that, put Solar Beam in the last moveslot.</p> <p>Despite Sludge Bomb being a very cool move, Poison is one of the worst attacking types in the game. In addition, Vileplume is slow and its Attack is only average.</p> <p>Either way, the idea is to find some place to Swords Dance--preferably against a Water or a fellow Grasser-and then attack away, using Moonlight when needed. You can try to put one counter to Sleep with Sleep Powder. Moonlight is replaceable for another attacking move. Hidden Power Fighting has a chance to OHKO Aggron after a Swords Dance, Hidden Power Ground helps for Metagross and still puts a dent in Tyranitar if you're using this in OU.

While it doesn't do much damage, this set makes a great supporter.</p> <p>Make sure to use a nature that reduces the attacking stat you're not using. An alternative way of EVing this Vileplume are shifting Special Defense to Defense and using Impish or Bold, depending on which attacking stat you're not using.

Suicune might have some troubles once Poliwrath is set up, especially if Suicune lacks Roar. Suicune can't Surf it, and Ice Beam won't do much to it.

Hydro Pump is pretty strong with STAB but is somewhat inaccurate. Counter can work off nicely due to its decent HP and Defense. Ice Beam can actually suit Poliwrath quite well. It does have some troubles with Salamence, and what can be more surprising than Ice Beaming it to oblivion.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Focus on Attack, with a bit of Speed (near max for Belly Drummers, a small amount for others), and drop the rest in HP or one of the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Claydol will just take it down, as long as it has Hidden Power Rock instead of Hidden Power Ghost. Note: Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Crobat will still be faster than Poliwrath after the Salac boost, 1 stat point faster to be precise, if you max out Speed. As such, they will be labeled as counters. Venusaur, Donphan, Skarmory to an extent, Slowbro, Weezing, Gyarados, Flying types, Metagross, Salamence, Celebi, and Dragonite hit Poliwrath hard, in any set. As in UU, without Hydro Pump, Gligar can take any abuse it gives it and finish it off.

You get Salac boost and you can just attack. Hidden Power Ghost hits Ghosts and Psychics super effectively, but Hidden Power Rock gets Fliers. Since Poliwrath can't get over 394 Speed (393 max with Salac), the EVs suggested give just enough to beat Jolly Dugtrio and Timid Alakazam, as well as take less than 25% from Salamence's Choice Band Rock Slide (so you can switch it in after it kills something, Substitute as it attacks for less than 1/4 or switches, and then Belly Drum). With Hidden Power Rock, you'll need to increase your Speed EVs by 4 at the cost of Defense.</p> <p>In UU, barring Jolly Persian and Electrode, Adamant Poliwrath with those EVs is faster than all UU Pokemon after its Salac activates, giving you some much needed hitting power.</p> <p>Return hits Poisons and, most importantly, Gligar much harder than Brick Break or your Hidden Powers, hits Fliers harder than Hidden Power Ghost, and hits Psychics harder than Hidden Power Rock. It will always OHKO Gligar, but even min HP Gligar has a chance to survive Adamant Hidden Power. You can't even touch Ghosts, obviously, but in UU, Gligar, Vileplume, and Hypno are all common, and Return is the only way to cover them all.

Ice Beam is to 2HKO Salamence, who is probably going to be their first switch in to Poliwrath. Focus Punch is easy to get off against Roar Suicune, and also good against Milotic.

In addition to strong moves with good coverage, as well as the highest non-Uber Special Attack stat in the game, it has awesome strategic choices such as Encore and Trick, which can completely screw over your opponent for the rest of the match. Alakazam is a force to be reckoned with, and should always be considered when making a team. It does suffer a little from four moveslot syndrome though: it could mess up everything in the game, if only it had more moveslots.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam also gets access to Barrier, and if you set it up correctly, Alakazam can survive physical attacks enough to make better use of Recover. It's rather risky, though, and needs to be executed flawlessly or it won't work. Thunder Wave can catch Metagross and Tyranitar on the switch and is a nice alternative. Safeguard + Recover enables Alakazam to always beat Blissey one-on-one, and Taunt works against Blissey as well as Celebi. With Knock Off, Alakazam can really hurt the tanking potential of Blissey and Snorlax, and if used on the switch-in, it gives away whether or not your opponent is using Choice Band Tyranitar. Toxic works on just about anything, especially Claydol and Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey, the best special wall in the game, is a good initial switch-in to also scout Alakazam's moveset, as she beats most Calm Mind variants--namely, those without Recover. However, watch out for unorthodox moves such as Focus Punch, Trick, and Knock Off, as these will be very annoying. Snorlax takes more damage from Psychic, and unlike Blissey cannot recover health with Soft-Boiled, but he doesn't mind being Tricked a Choice Band as much, and he can usually OHKO or 2HKO Alakazam. If Alakazam carries Recover, Blissey's only way to beat it is with damaging status moves. Thunder Wave will prevent Alakazam from sweeping, but Blissey still won't be able to beat Alakazam one-on-one unless she gets lucky with full paralysis. A badly poisoned Alakazam, however, will eventually faint, and one can always try for the freeze with Ice Beam. The problem with Ice Beam is that Alakazam carries Lum Berry more often than not, which means one will have to freeze it twice. On average, Ice Beam freezes once in 10 turns, and as Ice Beam has a maximum of 16 PP, Blissey will usually lose this matchup unless she has Serene Grace. Note that thanks to Synchronize, if Blissey paralyzes or poisons Alakazam, she will suffer from the same status condition until you switch her out or use Aromatherapy.</p> <p>Houndoom is immune to Psychic, and--depending on his ability--resists or is immune to Fire Punch. Additionally, he has both Crunch and Pursuit to OHKO Alakazam whether it stays in or switches out. However, if Alakazam has Hidden Power Water or Thunder Punch, Houndoom will be 2HKOed, or even OHKOed if Alakazam has a Calm Mind boost. Tyranitar can use Pursuit as well, and is generally a safer bet as he isn't OHKOed by anything Alakazam can throw at him, doesn't terribly mind being Tricked a Choice Band, and can Rock Slide Alakazam for the OHKO.</p> <p>Metagross 4x resists Psychic moves and can OHKO with any of Meteor Mash, Shadow Ball, and sometimes even Earthquake. However, he is weak to Fire Punch, making him a shaky counter. While he can survive a Calm Mind-boosted Fire Punch in a pinch, beware of being worn down, burned, or damaged by a critical hit. Jirachi boasts the same typing as Metagross does, and is more durable on the special side. He won't be able to OHKO Alakazam without a novelty move, though, such as Choice Band Shadow Ball or Doom Desire. Celebi resists Psychic, can Recover all day long, and annoy Alakazam with Leech Seed, but it will usually fall to Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Trick, Substitute, or Encore. Claydol makes a good check as long as he avoids a super effective Hidden Power or Ice Punch, as his Psychic resistance, nice Special Defense, and capability to 2HKO with Earthquake or Shadow Ball make him quite a reliable counter.</p> <p>Dusclops doesn't boast good resistances, but isn't OHKOed by any of Alakazam's moves either, and needs only about 36 Attack EVs to KO Alakazam with Shadow Ball. Sableye is immune to Psychic, can Recover off unboosted hits, and his STAB Shadow Ball KOes Alakazam more often than not. Beware, though, as a Calm Mind-boosted Fire Punch 2HKOes him.</p>",

Ice Punch can come in useful against Salamence and Flygon, but a Calm Mind-boosted Psychic takes care of them as well. It's handy for Claydol though. Hidden Power Water is good for the very same Claydol, as well as Houndoom and Tyranitar. Recover is another good move: Alakazam won't be able to use Recover against much, but with a few Calm Minds under its belt, it can handle Ice Beam Blissey, Milotic, and other weak special attackers. Leftovers provides Alakazam with passive recovery, but you might want to use a Lum Berry so freeze and paralysis don't stop Alakazam in its tracks.</p> <p>Alakazam should always run lots of Speed so it can outrun as many threats as possible and land crucial hits when it needs to.

Furthermore, Substitute enables Alakazam to scout the move of the Choice Band Tyranitar, Snorlax, or Metagross that might come in on it. Macho Brace can be used to screw over fast Pokemon, but it slows down Alakazam before the Trick.

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Victreebel is usually not worth using in UU due to it being outclassed by Vileplume, which is far bulkier and thus leverages its typing better defensively. However, Victreebel is more functional as a Swords Dance user due to its higher Attack and Speed, making it potentially threatening if faster checks can be removed; it even has a small edge over Tentacruel in this role thanks to Sleep Powder, although its middling Speed and poor coverage make it relatively easy to stop regardless. Sludge Bomb's damage output is quite good even against neutral targets, especially after a boost; at +2 it notably OHKOes common threats like Ampharos, Lanturn, specially defensive Vileplume, and offensive Kangaskhan after Spikes damage. Sludge Bomb's poison chance also lets it exert pressure even on reliable switch-ins like Scyther and Arcanine. Hidden Power Ground provides crucial coverage for Rock-, Steel-, and opposing Poison-types such as Omastar, Aggron, and Tentacruel, although it leaves Victreebel walled by Gligar as well as common Levitate users such as Misdreavus and Solrock. Sleep Powder is the preferred fourth move, being an extremely valuable tool for creating setup opportunities and disrupting the opponent's defensive core, and it has little opportunity cost since Victreebel has no useful coverage options beyond Hidden Power. However, if you don't enjoy the risk of missing Sleep Powder, Encore is similarly helpful for locking slower foes into unfavorable moves such as Toxic. Synthesis is another usable option to enhance Victreebel's longevity, but its frailty limits the move's effectivenenss.</p> <p>Good teammates for Victreebel generally fall into two categories: supportive Pokemon that can help it sweep or handle its checks, and other offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of Sleep Powder. Omastar is a great example of the former, switching into threatening Normal- and Flying-type attacks for it from the likes of Kangaskhan, Granbull, and Scyther, and setting up the Spikes that are necessary to make lasting progress against common checks like Arcanine and bulky Water-types. Solrock has a similarly useful defensive profile while also checking Gligar and pivoting around Psychic-type attacks for Victreebel. Having a plan for faster checks like Scyther, Arcanine, and Haunter is also important, with this usually being done via paralysis support from a lure like Body Slam Kangaskhan or, on hyper offense teams, with an even faster threat like Electrode, one's own Scyther, or Rain Dance Gorebyss. On the topic of Gorebyss, any frail sweeper that appreciates a free turn of setup will enjoy Victreebel's Sleep Powder; this can also include Rain Dance Omastar as well as Swords Dance Scyther, Calm Mind Grumpig, and Dragon Dance Pupitar among others.</p>"

Counter is a great surprise: Golem can survive many Earthquakes and Fighting hits to bounce them back for a quick KO. Roar is useful for Baton Pass chains.</p> <p>Golem can use Body Slam to paralyze a few of its counters, and can follow up with Rock Slide to lock them into paralysis and flinch until they faint. Focus Punch can hit some things hard on the switch, but it has the same power as Earthquake after STAB, so that won't generally do much for you.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Just put a load in HP and Attack, and a little in Defense.

Levitate grants it immunity to Earthquake, and with stacked HP and Defense and a faster Reflect, it is not easy to get past. Lunatone has less Defense, but the same typing and ability as well as that super effective Ice Beam to watch out for. Grasses generally make Golem shiver with fear, especially those who have Earthquake resistance, like Meganium and Bellossom. Vileplume and Victreebel OHKO him with any Grass move as well, but they don't like eating repeated STAB Earthquakes. Waters are a problem as well as that's Golem's secondary 4x weakness. Blastoise, Politoed and Poliwrath can all take a beating and Surf or Hydro Pump away. Walrein is weak to Rock, but if it can get in on another move, Golem is still toast. Quagsire has the advantage of the Rock resistance, and can also use STAB Earthquake or Surf, or Ice Beam. Misdreavus is immune to Double-Edge, Explosion, and Earthquake which is a great hindrance, especially for Choice Banders.</p> <p>Besides all this, any kind of decently powered special attack will really mess up Golem, if it doesn't end up KOing him.

Roar is useful to catch out Baton Pass chains. If you manage to catch Ninjask with it, Rock Blast also ruins the standard Baton Pass chain, but it is generally inferior to Rock Slide. Golem can use Body Slam to paralyze a few of its counters, then follow up with Rock Slide for a paraflinch combo. Focus Punch can hit certain threats hard on the switch, but it has the same power as Earthquake after accounting for STAB, so it is generally not that useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory not only walls Golem, but can also lay Spikes, use Toxic, and phaze Golem. Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock can 3HKO it, however. Forretress lacks an immunity to Earthquake and is similarly troubled by the Choice Band set, but it can use Spikes and Toxic as well. Also troublesome are defensive Water-types, such as Slowbro, Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert, all of whom can take an Earthquake or two and OHKO Golem with Surf or Hydro Pump. Swampert often carries Protect to thwart Explosion as well, but it might not always carry a Water-type move. Regardless, Ice Beam and Earthquake let it do severe damage to Golem.</p> <p>Claydol can sponge most of Golem's moves, and is only really threatened by Hidden Power Bug or Choice Band Double-Edge; it can then set up Reflect, or ruin Golem with any of Ice Beam, Earthquake, Psychic, or Toxic. Gengar can come in on anything that isn't a Rock move and use Giga Drain, Will-O-Wisp, or Ice Punch to beat Golem into submission. Flygon and Breloom will regret coming into Double-Edge, but they resist the SlideQuake combination and have super effective STAB moves to wield against Golem. Celebi can Recover off the little damage it takes from most of Golem's moves, especially a resisted Earthquake, and OHKO with a Grass move or 2HKO with Psychic.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Apart from its unfortunate weaknesses to Water and Ground, Golem is a pretty decent Pokemon. This set capitalizes on Golem's ability to hit hard and take blows from the opponent's Pokemon with relative ease. It's not the best Pokemon in the world, being partially outclassed by Rhydon and having pitiful Special Defense and abysmal Speed, but Golem can get the job done regardless. Earthquake is the first STAB move of choice, boasting solid power and great neutral coverage. Rock Slide serves as Golem's secondary STAB and has great coverage with Earthquake, hitting Salamence, Gyarados, and the like hard. Additionally, it has a 30% chance to flinch, which is useful for defeating Snorlax and Forretress. Golem's two STABs form the QuakeSlide combination, which has, at the very least, neutral coverage on pretty much everything not named Claydol, Flygon, or Breloom. Hidden Power Rock is an option over Rock Slide for its 100% accuracy, but the lack of a flinch chance makes it inferior to Rock Slide, not to mention that using it prevents the use of Hidden Power Bug. Speaking of Hidden Power Bug, it provides crucial coverage on Celebi, who could otherwise switch in with impunity. Double-Edge is another possible choice, boasting decent coverage and a lack of recoil thanks to Rock Head. Double-Edge is generally the safest move to go for in most scenarios as it prevents Salamence or Gyarados from switching in unscathed, unlike Earthquake. The last moveslot is occupied by Explosion, which enables Golem to KO most Pokemon that do not possess a Ghost typing and gives it a way to actually do some damage to Skarmory and Swampert.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Golem can survive an Earthquake from Choice Band Salamence or +1 Tyranitar and outspeed Blissey and Swampert. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack and supplemented by an Adamant nature for maximum damage output.</p> <p>Golem needs a lot of support from its teammates to function effectively. It can't do much damage to bulky Water-types, such as Swampert and Milotic, so Celebi is a great partner, as it has excellent type synergy with Golem. Zapdos is another option to beat bulky Water-types and has an immunity to Golem's Ground-type weakness, which Celebi lacks. Do note that Golem can damage bulky Water-types if it gets a chance to hit them multiple times, but it won't be able to survive the turns it needs to do so. Spikes support is helpful to wear down Golem's switch-ins, so Skarmory and Forretress make great partners. Skarmory can switch in on just about every attack that threatens Golem, which is very useful. Rapid Spin support from Forretress or Cloyster is recommended to prevent Golem from being worn down by Spikes, which is important because of how easily it is worn down without them. In a similar vein, Wish support is helpful, replenishing the HP Golem loses to residual damage such as status conditions and Leech Seed. Blissey and Jirachi are the best choices for Wish passing as they are both very bulky and can take on Celebi and the bulky Water-types that give Golem trouble; Blissey in particular is well-suited for this role. Lastly, Skarmory is a massive pain for Golem as it can set up the Spikes Golem dreads right in its face. For this reason, Pokemon such as Metagross with Hidden Power Fire or Thunder Punch, Fire Blast Snorlax, Hydro Pump Swampert, Choice Band Aerodactyl, Choice Band Tyranitar, Fire Blast Salamence, or a Choice Band Fighting-type is recommended to take on Skarmory. The support that Golem requires is fairly substantial, as you can see, but it can work to decent effect if you give it the support it desires.</p>"

It can Roar away the feared Calm Mind Celebi, laughs at most Swampert, and can easily stall out Blissey and all sorts of Water-types. As Grass-types don't appreciate the threat of a STAB Ice Beam, Articuno does a great job at absorbing Sleep Powder and Spore, and even Milotic's Hypnosis. Additionally, Articuno nullifies Snorlax with Reflect and either Haze or Roar. It also scares away any Salamence without Rock Slide and keeps it from coming in regardless of the set. Finally, Articuno is not 2HKOed by most non-STAB Thunderbolts. It takes some prediction to do good damage with Articuno, though.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The only reason to use Haze over Roar is because the former doesn't have negative priority, but Roar's ability to rack up Spikes damage is generally preferable. Hidden Power Fire lets Articuno take down Metagross, and Hidden Power Flying does a number on Heracross.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rock Blast Octillery makes the best Articuno counter because it's immune to Roar and resists Ice Beam. On a more serious note, Metagross resists Ice Beam and can crush Articuno with STAB Meteor Mash. Tyranitar takes neutral damage from Ice Beam, but knocks out Articuno with Rock Slide. Raikou and Jolteon take light damage from Ice Beam and 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Rock Slide Swampert, though uncommon, is easy to bring in and will usually 2HKO Articuno. Any Fire-type with decent Special Attack puts the hurt on Articuno as well.</p> <p>Registeel does not threaten to OHKO, but can wall Articuno all day and can gradually wear it down with Rock Slide or Hidden Power Steel. Regice might not be able to KO Articuno quickly with Thunderbolt either, but doesn't take much damage from Ice Beam; the same applies to Lanturn, Lapras, and Starmie.</p> <p>Snorlax takes next to nothing from Ice Beam, can boost up with Curse, and hit Articuno with STAB Normal-type moves before it can Roar Snorlax away. Jirachi resists Ice Beam, can set up Calm Mind boosts, and hit Articuno with a super effective Fire Punch, Thunder, or Thunderbolt. Blissey can wall Articuno, but will not win a one-on-one stall war thanks to Pressure.</p> <p>In general, anything that can take an Ice Beam and use a Rock move is a great counter. However, it is worth noting that all of Articuno's counters are susceptible to Spikes.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Articuno is a stall machine; with good HP and Defense, and marvelous Special Defense, it makes a premier Sleep Talk user. As the real strategy of this set is to rack up as much Spikes damage as possible, make sure you have that on your team when using Articuno.</p> <p>Articuno should mainly look to come in on Celebi and Swampert. If the latter lacks Rock Slide, neither can hurt Articuno much, and they will simply waste their PP to Pressure. Your opponent will probably realize this and switch out; this is where you outpredict and use Roar. Spikes will deal damage to both your opponent's counter of choice and the random Pokemon dragged in by Roar, provided they aren't Levitate users or Flying-types--most of whom are hit super effectively by Ice Beam. Additionally, because they would likely have switched to their counter, their active Pokemon will often not be their best answer to Articuno. The real draw to this set, though, is when Articuno is sleeping. If Sleep Talk selects Roar, and Articuno happens to be faster than its opponent, Articuno will Roar the foe away before it can do anything for free Spikes damage.</p> <p>In a nutshell, this set is pretty simple. Stall to eternity and back, come in on Water-types, Blissey, or the aforementioned Swampert and Celebi to safely Rest up, and make sure not to run out of Ice Beam PP (Sleep Talk helps with this).</p>"

Again, one can choose a RestTalk strategy, which also helps conserve Heal Bell PP. Reflect supports the team and guards Articuno against Metagross and users of Rock Slide. Toxic cripples Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Suicune, but is useless against Steels and Blissey. Articuno can make use of Roar, of course, though not as effectively as it can in the first set.</p> <p>Always maximize Articuno's HP for optimum Leftovers recovery and maximum durability. Use a Calm nature, as Special Defense is Articuno's greatest stat and should be boosted. As Articuno has the same Speed stat as Suicune, it should run a small amount of Speed EVs to Roar Suicune out first; this also guarantees Articuno outruns Jolly Marowak. If you're not using Roar, this obviously becomes less important, but beating Marowak is still useful, and you might want to get in a Haze before being hit by Surf. The spare EVs can go into either Special Attack or Special Defense.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Zapdos is the most versatile special threat in ADV OU. Its Special Attack is off the charts and supported by a good Speed tier and respectable bulk. By compressing coverage into two staple attacks, it utilizes its filler moveslots and customizable EV spreads to insert itself into a broad range of archetypes. Notably, Zapdos fits like a glove on Spikesless offense teams, but it also finds its way into several formulations of Spikes offense, Toxic + Sandstorm + Spikes (TSS), sand-less Spikes stall, and bulky setup teams. As an offensive threat, Zapdos's greatest asset is its immediate power and speed. Its typing also allows it to pivot into bulky Water-types and Metagross with ease. With Agility and Baton Pass, Zapdos can also support powerful teammates or act as a late-game cleaner. Its decent Attack stat also allows it to be a mixed wallbreaker. As a defensive tank, Zapdos boasts being the only specially bulky Spikes-immune Pokemon, and its ability, Pressure, allows it to stall out Pokemon that wall it. However, while Zapdos is fast, there are still a number of Pokemon in the metagame like Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Starmie that outspeed it; though these Pokemon either lack consistent raw power, move flexibility, or opportunities to switch into battle that Zapdos does, respectively, Speed is frequently enough of a reason to choose these threats over it when offensive teams need a fast late-game sweeper. With room for only two coverage moves on special sets, Zapdos has to make a compromise when choosing its intended targets. Zapdos also frequently falls short of 2HKOing Tyranitar, which can exploit this fact to set up a Dragon Dance sweep. Finally, the decent-at-best bulk of the defensive set, which is just enough for walling special attacks, is really appealing in theory, but a single misstep or critical hit may put Zapdos into an endless Rest loop, rendering it useless and making it a momentum drain for the rest of the game. In spite of these shortfalls, Zapdos is still an amazing Pokemon to use and a prevalent threat that every team must have a good strategy against to be viable.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metal Sound can be used to put opposing Celebi and Blissey under increasing pressure until the opponent gives in and switches out to something frail to have it eat a Thunderbolt. It also prevents Curse Snorlax from setting up indefinitely if it is the opponent's last Pokemon. Choice Band can be used to OHKO Tyranitar and 2HKO Blissey with Hidden Power Fighting and to 2HKO Celebi with Drill Peck. Thunder's high-Base Power and paralysis rate allow Zapdos to muscle through Suicune and Snorlax more quickly, assuming it hits; it is most reliable on Rest Zapdos, which can boost its accuracy with Rain Dance and even out the odds of it hitting over the course of a long battle. Pinch Berries like Salac Berry, Petaya Berry, and Liechi Berry can be used with Substitute + Baton Pass Zapdos to support teammates offensively in the face of Zapdos's checks. Lum Berry can be used on mixed Zapdos to tide through a single turn of status from Blissey as Zapdos wallbreaks. A physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to keep the team safe from Choice Band Metagross and deal with Salamence in a pinch on teams without a bulky Water-type. This defensive variant is useful on paralysis spam teams, for example, which otherwise try to use an awkward combination of Gyarados's Intimidate and Marowak to deal with Salamence, Metagross, and Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey and Celebi are the best Zapdos checks in a vacuum, as they both have great special bulk and Natural Cure. Blissey takes almost nothing from Zapdos's special attacks, and Zapdos's mixed sets cannot 2HKO Blissey without some prior chip damage. Celebi is more susceptible to getting worn down by repeated uses of Hidden Power Ice and Toxic but can regain the lost momentum with Leech Seed or Calm Mind + Baton Pass. In practice, however, Zapdos users often maintain pressure on these checks with Metagross or Dugtrio at the back. Blissey and Celebi must also beware of Rest Zapdos, which requires additional offensive support to take down, either with sand or hard-hitting physical threats like Tyranitar and Snorlax.</p> <p>Snorlax is the standard offensive check to special attackers on Spikesless teams; it has a limited lifetime, especially under sand and with Spikes on the field, due to its lack of access to instant recovery, but it can come in once or twice against Zapdos and threaten to paralyze or KO it with Body Slam or Self-Destruct. Curse Snorlax is a little bulkier, but it otherwise suffers from similar issues. Jolteon is frequently used as an offensive check to Zapdos on Spikes offense teams due to its ability Volt Absorb, but Thunder Wave from Zapdos neuters Jolteon's greatest asset: its Speed. Defensive Jirachi can tank Zapdos's attacks all day and pass Wish, yet it similarly does not appreciate getting paralyzed. Regice is a niche special wall that is amazing at forcing Zapdos out by threatening to paralyze or OHKO it, though it is very vulnerable to Toxic and Spikes damage.</p> <p>It should be noted that Zapdos hates to be statused. Paralysis takes away the speed that makes Zapdos so threatening and immediately opens it up to all sorts of strong physical or super effective attacks, even from Pokemon like Swampert it is meant to check; this is an important factor to consider when deciding whether to trade Thunder Wave in the mirror matchup. Even though Zapdos is a specially offensive Pokemon, early-game poison and burn will still accrue a lot of damage on it, as Zapdos is likely to come into play multiple times throughout a game.</p> <p>Finally, Zapdos has some unique situational pivots and checks. Tyranitar can absorb Thunderbolt and take Zapdos down in a pinch, although it usually wants to save its HP for better uses like a Dragon Dance sweep. Claydol can come in on Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave and potentially use Refresh to eliminate Toxic poison. The opponent can then pivot to a check like Curse Snorlax or Rest Zapdos on Hidden Power to prolong the target's longevity. Dugtrio can do likewise, despite being a much riskier switch-in. Similarly, Magneton can take a Thunderbolt and disable Zapdos with a status move; this maneuver may be used to prolong Snorlax's longevity, especially on offensive teams. Finally, the combination of Swampert and Flygon can be used to cover both of Zapdos's Hidden Power types, but the weakness of this core to Water-types renders it pretty rare.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Zapdos looks deceptively linear and straightforward, but it is one of the most temporally versatile Pokemon in ADV OU. Unlike wallbreakers that are early-game one-trick ponies or sweepers that only become potent in the late-game, Zapdos can find a role to play at every stage of the game. As a lead, offensive Zapdos scores an advantage over other common leads with its ability to prevents Spikes by forcing out Skarmory. It also preserves frail offensive teammates by forcing out Choice Band or mixed Salamence leads or neutering opposing Zapdos leads with Thunder Wave. Spikesless offense teams are quite weak to opposing Zapdos, so using one's own Zapdos to paralyze the other in the mirror lead matchup is crucial for success a lot of the time. Zapdos's filler move can be particularly helpful in dealing with unfavorable lead matchups: Baton Pass allows one to anticipate Focus Punch from Tyranitar, while Protect scouts the move of Choice Band Metagross, notably neutering any immediate attempt at using Explosion. Mid-game, Zapdos performs very well at maintaining momentum. As Zapdos is very reliable at forcing out Water-types and drawing in special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi, one can keep up the offensive pressure by double switching to a wallbreaker like Choice Band or mixed Metagross or mixed Tyranitar. Complementarily, Zapdos supports these wallbreakers very well, following up with a KO when, for instance, Tyranitar's Hidden Power Grass fails to finish off Swampert or Snorlax's Self-Destruct leaves Metagross or Tyranitar hanging by a thread; the opponent will frequently hesitate to switch lest the pivot eat a chunk from Thunderbolt. Notably, Zapdos is so feared because even two of the Pokemon that wall it can be worn down over the course of the game. As offensive Snorlax is 4HKOed by Zapdos under sand, it can only switch into Zapdos twice and may even struggle to do so with Spikes on the field. Zapdos can also put Celebi on a timer with Toxic, repeatedly chip it with Hidden Power Ice as Celebi uses Recover until Toxic's incremental damage is too high to contain, and then deal a heavy blow on the forced switch with Thunderbolt. Finally, while Zapdos is not known to exclusively be a late-game sweeper, its good Speed tier and decent bulk allow it to wipe out weakened teams after their fast Pokemon have been dealt with.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass threatens Swampert, and Hidden Power Ice chips Celebi; this comparison is emphasized because Swampert is strong against physical threats but weak against mixed threats, while for Celebi it is the other way around. Thus, on offensive teams, the Hidden Power type is frequently chosen to complement the type coverage of Zapdos's teammates. Another use of Hidden Power Grass is to minimize one's exposure to Swampert, especially on offensive TSS teams that have no good switch-ins against Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Ice has the added benefit of OHKOing Salamence and Flygon; this is helpful when one fits Zapdos on certain mid-paced TSS and bulky offense teams that would otherwise get destroyed by mixed Salamence. The choice of status move tends to depend on the pace of the team and the selected coverage move. Generally, Thunder Wave is favored when the pace is high to completely nullify Pokemon like Gengar and opposing Zapdos that use their Speed to threaten frail, offensive Zapdos teams. Toxic is useful on slower teams like TSS that have the bulk to drag the battle out and rack up Toxic damage. There is a tendency to pair Hidden Power Ice with Toxic to force Celebi to switch eventually and to pressure Swampert; this pairing is by no means exclusive, however.</p> <p>The filler move is more useful than it might seem at first glance, and some of its uses have been explained in the context of leading with Zapdos. On TSS teams, Roar can be used to rack up Spikes damage, but even without Spikes on the field, Roar reverses the momentum gained by Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi pivoting in and prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up on Zapdos. The latter benefit is particularly notable when Zapdos is used on offense teams with shaky Tyranitar checks like Metagross and offensive Swampert. Baton Pass maintains momentum by eliminating the need to read switches, complementing hyper offense teams without defensive backbones really well. It is particularly useful for eliminating the prediction needed bringing in strong but frail threats like Fighting-types. Protect gives Toxic more turns to do damage. One can even consider a dual status Zapdos set for versatility against offensive and defensive teams. Substitute can function like Protect, with the advantages of blocking status, activating pinch Berries, and being transferred to another Pokemon with Baton Pass.</p> <p>Timid is generally the preferred nature, as there are a number of noteworthy threats that Zapdos can shut down by outspeeding or attempting to win the Speed tie. Timid Zapdos scores the Speed advantage against standard mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence, Timid Moltres, defensive Gengar, and the rare Jynx while Speed tying with opposing Zapdos, Timid Jirachi, Jolly Choice Band Salamence, Timid Celebi, and Charizard. A Modest nature can be considered, however; it greatly improves the odds of 2HKOing offensive Tyranitar and defensive Suicune after the latter has used Calm Mind, as well as scoring certain OHKOs on Dugtrio and offensive Swampert. A spread of 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe with a Calm nature can alternatively be used to provide as many opportunities as possible for Zapdos to pivot into Water-types and generate momentum; it is also helpful when the team is shaky against opposing Zapdos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Zapdos is most notably a staple on Spikesless offense teams, but it can also fit on comfortably on Spikes offense and TSS teams. On offensive teams, Metagross is perhaps its most commonly seen partner, as it comes in comfortably on all of Zapdos's counters—Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi—and threatens to punch through common defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Swampert either with Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash, a special attack, or just an unboosted attack if Spikes are down. Metagross also offensively checks Rock-types that Zapdos cannot hold its ground against, while Zapdos, in return, gets opportunities to switch in on Metagross's checks. In a similar vein, Tyranitar with Focus Punch also appreciates Zapdos's ability to lure in special walls. Other aggressive partners of offensive Zapdos that can exploit its momentum maintaining capabilities are Snorlax, and offensive Swampert. Baton Pass Zapdos in particular benefits from Gengar, which takes no damage from Tyranitar or Snorlax's Focus Punch and can fire off Will-O-Wisp to cripple Tyranitar or Snorlax. It also eases the entry of powerful but frail threats like Heracross, Breloom, Hariyama, and Medicham. Dugtrio and offensive Zapdos support each other well on Spikesless offense teams; several Pokemon that either counter Zapdos or give it some trouble like Celebi, Blissey, Tyranitar, and Heracross can be removed by Dugtrio, and Baton Pass provides a means by which Dugtrio can come in safely to perform the trap. Another partner most frequently seen on Spikesless offense teams is Dragon Dance Salamence, which complements Zapdos as a sweeper. Zapdos can exert a lot of pressure on bulky Pokemon with average Speed tiers but struggles to maintain supremacy over faster but frail threats like Starmie, Gengar, Jolteon, and even opposing Zapdos. Salamence appreciates bulky Pokemon weakened, and with some chip damage, it annihilates all fast threats after a Dragon Dance. On Spikes offense, the partner used to threaten opposing fast threats is commonly Jolteon, which can come in at multiple points in the game to force switches and accumulate Spikes damage. The synergy of two Electric-types enables complementary Hidden Power type coverage, and one Electric-type can trade Thunder Wave with opposing Electric-types to protect the other from status.</p>"
        },
        "Rest": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rest Zapdos is notable as the only common specially bulky Spikes-immune Pokemon. On top of this, Pressure allows it to stall out walls over time. Thus, when physical threats have been removed, barring critical hits, Rest Zapdos can seem absolutely impossible to take down. Rest Zapdos generally appears on two archetypes: Spikes stall and bulky setup. On Spikes stall, Zapdos acts as a reliable phazer that has really good longevity and cannot be trapped. To underscore this point, compare Zapdos with Skarmory in their role as a phazer. With a single misprediction, Skarmory can easily be eliminated by Magneton. Even if the opponent does not have Magneton, it is nearly impossible to find a blanket solution that eliminates Skarmory's checks—Zapdos, Jolteon, Starmie, Moltres, and Gengar—to allow Skarmory to rack up Spikes damage. Furthermore, many of these checks are immune to Spikes and can come in repeatedly without a care. The Pokemon that can mount a significant offensive against Zapdos, however, including Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Metagross with the threat of Explosion, are all damaged by Spikes, and with some chip damage they can be trapped and eliminated by Dugtrio. Another function of Rest + Roar Zapdos is that it never allows Calm Mind users such as Celebi, Jirachi, and Suicune to take advantage of the team. This is an important point because Spikes stall tends to rely on Blissey and Celebi as special walls; these Pokemon are too passive to inflict enough damage before an unstoppable number of boosts have been accumulated by the foe. On Spikesless bulky setup teams, Zapdos has three main roles. First, these teams tend to rely on Claydol to remove Spikes, but as Claydol has no real offensive presence, Skarmory can continue to come in indefinitely against it; Zapdos provides the pressure needed to keep Skarmory off the field. Second, Zapdos functions as a mid-game pivot that can protect Snorlax, Suicune, or Jirachi from taking too much chip damage before they start their Curse or Calm Mind sweep. Mid-game maneuvers may include pivoting in on Celebi's Leech Seed, Gengar's and Moltres's Will-O-Wisp, bulky Water-types, opposing Zapdos, Jolteon, Metagross, mixed Salamence, Heracross, and Gyarados. Note that even with all the defensive investment, Zapdos is particularly susceptible to damage, so care should be taken to get Zapdos in on relatively benign moves. Third, Zapdos eliminates sand via Rain Dance to promote the longevity of the aforementioned setup sweepers. As a word of caution, note that Rest Zapdos is extremely vulnerable to super effective damage taken while switching in and critical hits, as it frequently has just enough bulk to survive Rest loops but not any more than that. Having to use Rest prematurely is a huge momentum sink that allows setup threats like Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Curse Snorlax as well as Choice Band-wielding threats Tyranitar and Salamence to come in freely. Even assuming one is successful at navigating around these threats, getting Zapdos to wake up once it gets into a bad Rest situation requires quite a bit of skillful maneuvering. For example, carelessly sending Rest Zapdos into Modest Blissey's Ice Beam under sand and being forced to use Rest as a result means Zapdos will start off with two sleep turns at around 60% of its HP, and it becomes an uphill task to even keep Zapdos alive from there.</p> <p>Toxic lets Zapdos attempt to damage or force out everything that Thunderbolt cannot damage significantly, including Blissey, Celebi, Swampert, Flygon, and Claydol. As mentioned earlier, Roar goes well with Spikes, and Rain Dance supports Curse Snorlax and Suicune. Rain Dance also markedly improves Zapdos's longevity by removing sand, ensuring that it is almost never 3HKOed by Timid Zapdos's Thunderbolt, defensive Gengar's Ice Punch, or Modest Blissey's Ice Beam. Light Screen can be used on teams that wish to protect Skarmory and Forretress from Magneton and KO it back with Dugtrio or Forretress's Earthquake; it also provides much-needed additional longevity for Zapdos, especially when one wants to keep sand around for indirect damage. It is possible to use both Light Screen and Roar without Toxic, especially when many Claydol and Swampert run Refresh, or if one still needs to patch up the weakness to Calm Mind users, but such a set's inability to hit offensive Swampert is a huge momentum loss. Alternative options in the fourth moveslot are Hidden Power Ice for extra pressure on Celebi and Hidden Power Grass for tackling Refresh Swampert. Thunder Wave can be used to inflict status on Jirachi, Snorlax, and Leftovers Tyranitar. Paralyzing opposing fast Zapdos and Jolteon also allows Rest Zapdos to exploit full paralysis to burn sleep turns. The EVs are selected for maximum special bulk, but one can also run 32 Speed EVs to outspeed all Tyranitar variants. 32 Defense EVs can be used to always survive Dragon Dance Salamence's boosted Rock Slide. It is inadvisable, however, to take too much away from Zapdos's special bulk because Zapdos frequently sits just below the threshold of getting 3HKOed by strong super effective special attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rest Zapdos is expected to come into play frequently over a long battle, so it is imperative that all of its physical checks be dealt with reliably. Tyranitar is best removed using Dugtrio, but an early-game check to it is also necessary to tide through periods of physical punishment, and Claydol is perfect for this. Claydol's Rapid Spin is also very useful for reducing Spikes damage for teammates over the course of a long battle, and Zapdos helps to cover the Water-types that Claydol attracts. In the rare instance that one decides not to use Dugtrio as a partner, another Rock-type answer such as Metagross is almost imperative. By virtue of using a slow Zapdos variant without Thunder Wave, Rest Zapdos teams are frequently weak to offensive Suicune and usually have to go out of their way to provide some mitigating measures for it. Blissey is the best answer to Suicune, but when it does not fit the style of the team, one can tweak Celebi to outspeed Suicune or attempt to wear Suicune down with Jirachi.</p> <p>On Spikes stall teams, Skarmory is the canonical Spiker, and it also checks Snorlax. A spinblocker in Gengar is especially useful, since Rest Zapdos has no direct way of damaging Claydol, many of which carry Refresh. Blissey with Aromatherapy can save Zapdos from dire circumstances when it gets forced into a Rest loop. Heal Bell Celebi provides similar support, and the combination of Zapdos and Celebi shields the team from most special threats that are either Water- or Electric-types. On bulky setup teams, Rest Zapdos supports Curse Snorlax, Rest Suicune, and Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi.</p>"

        "Agility + Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is a variant of offensive Zapdos that performs a dual role as an offense supporter and late-game sweeper. Agility lets Zapdos outspeed every conceivable foe and pass the boost to a powerful threat to tackle bulky opposing Pokemon or directly wipe out frail offense teams itself. Zapdos excels at the Speed passing role because of its ability to pressure the common phazers Skarmory, Suicune, Swampert, and Tyranitar. Its versatility in being able to directly do damage ensures that it does not become deadweight in the event that Speed passing is unnecessary. A Modest nature is used not only because Agility makes up for the Speed lost, but also since after taking a hit to set up Agility, Zapdos can't really afford to take any more damage from Swampert or Dugtrio and would like them cleanly KOed. Furthermore, Baton Pass teams tend to make sacrifices defensively in favor of offensive momentum, so threatening the 2HKO may be essential to avoid a sweep from +2 Dragon Dance Tyranitar. The EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Heracross while always surviving Modest Suicune's Calm Mind-boosted Ice Beam under sand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is an amazing partner for Zapdos. Not only does Celebi set up its own boosts and maintain the Baton Pass chain, it also has the right tools to stop Zapdos's checks from ruining the chain. For example, its ability Natural Cure lets it absorb Thunder Wave from Blissey and, with its reduced Speed, pass the boosts to the intended recipient, which can come in without taking a single hit. Celebi's Grass typing and boosted Hidden Power Fire also prevent opposing Celebi from trying to foil the plan with Leech Seed. Slow but powerful threats make great Baton Pass recipients. Especially when combined with Calm Mind boosts from Celebi, mixed recipients like offensive Swampert, Metagross, Tyranitar, Salamence, and Charizard appreciate Zapdos's Speed boosts to outspeed and threaten to KO their usual checks like Gengar, Zapdos, and Starmie. Alternatively, the Speed boost can be passed to physical threats, most notably Marowak, which has the advantage of being immune to Thunder Wave and can OHKO almost everything after a Swords Dance boost. Metagross, Machamp, and Rhydon are other possible physical Baton Pass recipients. Building along the same physically offensive path, one can also consider passing boosts with Swords Dance + Baton Pass Celebi with Magneton support.</p>"
        },
        "Mixed": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mixed Zapdos is a variant of offensive Zapdos with three attacking moves that hit almost everything for solid damage but usually fall short of scoring the OHKO. This shortfall is made up for by Spikes damage, where on Spikes offense teams, Zapdos performs the role of a mid-game wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. Less commonly, mixed Zapdos gets its power boost passed from Swords Dance Celebi. Drill Peck's main function is to take a chunk off of Pokemon that normally wall Zapdos, such as Celebi and Blissey, while providing the auxiliary benefit of OHKOing Heracross. The sweeper set tends to use Hidden Power Grass + Agility for maximum type coverage with the listed EV spread to outspeed Heracross and to maximize the odds of OHKOing Swampert and Dugtrio. The latter point is especially important, as Zapdos is not expected to be able to survive another hit after already taking damage while using Agility. The wallbreaker set tends to run an EV spread of 252 Atk / 12 SpA / 244 Spe with a Lonely nature to exert maximum pressure on Celebi and Blissey, and Hidden Power Fighting on this set allows Zapdos to 2HKO Blissey under sand with three layers of Spikes on the field. Hidden Power Fighting also prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar from getting two boosts on Zapdos and annihilating the entire team. As the Hidden Power Fighting set does not get past Swampert, it tends to be more useful to use a status move in the last slot if it is run. The last slot can also be used for a move that synergizes with the rest of the team, such as Roar or Baton Pass. On TSS teams, Roar can be used to rack up Spikes damage, but even without Spikes on the field, Roar reverses the momentum gained by Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi pivoting in and prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up on Zapdos. The latter benefit is particularly notable when Zapdos is used on offense teams with shaky Tyranitar checks like Metagross and offensive Swampert. Baton Pass generally maintains momentum by eliminating the need to read switches, but it notably synergizes with Swords Dance Celebi by helping to maintain the Baton Pass chain. Note that the roles of wallbreaker and sweeper are not entirely exclusive and are matchup dependent, for Zapdos's excellent all-around offensive stats allow its roles to intersect regardless of its EV spread. In its wallbreaking role, Drill Peck and Hidden Power Fighting are best used as surprises when the opponent inadvertently or inevitably lets Celebi or Blissey get chipped into 2HKO range of these moves over the course of a game, although with the alternate EV spread, an observant player might get suspicious the moment lower-than-expected damage from Thunderbolt is revealed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Zapdos is most frequently used on teams with an offensive slant. If Spikes is the method chosen to support mixed Zapdos, the Spiker can be Skarmory—the golden standard—but it can also be Cloyster, which is immune to trapping and uses Explosion and Surf to hold its ground against the premier Rapid Spin user, Claydol. Spikesless offensive support is also possible, albeit less common. Swords Dance + Baton Pass Celebi can also provide Zapdos with the firepower needed to muscle through its counters. Explosion from Gengar, Regice, and Weezing or forcing a trade with Dugtrio can also bring Zapdos's checks within KO range of its physical attacks without losing momentum.</p> <p>To fulfill its roles effectively, mixed Zapdos differs from standard offensive Zapdos in two ways. First, it relinquishes early-game utility, as it wants to stay damage and status free, leaving the team potentially vulnerable to status from opposing lead Zapdos. Second, its relatively low Speed allows it to be exploited by opposing Zapdos or even Moltres. Making up for the first point is not easy for Spikes teams, for Swampert and Metagross are risky pivots into status moves. Using Tyranitar as a pivot is perhaps the lesser of evils, as it is relatively slow to begin with and can force Zapdos out. Celebi can also be used as a pivot into status moves, but it can be exploited by dangerous threats like Choice Band Salamence, Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Tyranitar, so matching the low pace of Celebi to an offensive team will require some thought. Just like the standard offensive set, Pokemon that put pressure on Blissey and Snorlax like offensive Swampert and Metagross are good partners for mixed Zapdos, as Drill Peck lacks the power to muscle through them early-game. It's also important to emphasize the synergy of faster secondary sweepers as partners, not only to cover mixed Zapdos's lack of speed but also to benefit from its wallbreaking abilities. Jolteon, in particular, gets a special mention for its ability to check opposing Zapdos by trading Thunder Wave and to offer complementary Hidden Power type coverage. Jolteon also supports the team through discouraging opposing Zapdos' use of Thunderbolt with Volt Absorb, letting Tyranitar come in to absorb status with less fear of getting chipped too much.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Moltres's position as an offensive Fire-type with a solid Speed tier and a Spikes immunity gives it quite the niche in ADV OU. Its access to STAB Flamethrower and Fire Blast allows it to pressure passive Pokemon like Skarmory and Celebi while offensively checking Metagross, Jirachi, Heracross, and Gengar. Moltres's ability to answer Metagross is particularly crucial, as it can deny Metagross momentum with the threat of a STAB Fire move, which helps protect a team's Skarmory or defensive Water-type from a potential Explosion. Furthermore, Moltres can spread burns with Will-O-Wisp for the purpose of crippling certain physical attackers, inflicting chip damage on Blissey, and forcing Snorlax and Suicune to Rest and become sitting ducks. Moltres's Speed tier of base 90 gets the jump on most of ADV's mid-ranged Speed tiers, beating out neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as the deadly Jolly Heracross with maximum investment, but it falls short of some of the tier's faster threats like Starmie and Jolteon. Moltres's weaknesses to Rock, Electric, and Water make it easy to force out after a KO, and thoughtlessly slapping it onto a team can exacerbate weaknesses to Pokemon like Zapdos, Starmie, and Aerodactyl. Moltres is a Pokemon that demands certain support structures to function at its best, but it serves those structures remarkably well and counters major threats that they would otherwise struggle against.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sunny Day can be used with Will-O-Wisp on defensive teams, with the idea being that a burned Tyranitar will eventually get whittled down and faint or be picked off by Dugtrio, allowing Moltres to dispel its sand with Sunny Day, making threats like CurseLax and Suicune much more difficult to deal with. Morning Sun works well with Sunny Day or an alternative weather removal option, as it provides a way to keep Moltres healthy throughout the game.</p> <p>Substitute can be used on sets intended for early-game use, taking the pressure off choosing between Will-O-Wisp or the Fire-type attack when you don't know your opponent's switch-in. However, such sets lack longevity and generally flounder against defensive answers to Moltres like Blissey and Suicune. In a different vein, Agility can be used to boost Moltres's Speed and allow it to clean against weakened teams. However, Moltres's Fire + Grass coverage is walled by certain common Pokemon—Salamence in particular—and thus it requires stringent support to be consistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Refresh Milotic is arguably the best check to Moltres that exists, being able to heal burns with Refresh and taking Hidden Power Grass with aplomb thanks to naturally high Special Defense and access to Recover. However, with prior chip damage as well as sand and Spikes support, Moltres can threaten to break through Milotic in a one-on-one situation; keep in mind that Milotic threatens to 2HKO Moltres with STAB Surf. Blissey easily takes all of Moltres's moves; however, it is annoyed by burn damage and can be chipped by phazing it on the switch with Spikes down. Suicune has prodigious natural special bulk combined with Calm Mind as well as Pressure to burn through Moltres' PP and Rest to heal off burns. Curse Snorlax poses a similar threat with its naturally high Special Defense, but both Pokemon cannot switch in repeatedly with sand and Spikes up and are vulnerable to being phazed if they are forced to Rest.</p> <p>Tyranitar of course threatens to destroy Moltres with Rock Slide or use it to set up Dragon Dances; however, the dino gets chipped by Spikes, particularly if running a Lum Berry—without which Will-O-Wisp becomes painful to deal with—and doesn't serve as a reliable long-term check. Furthermore, a cautious Moltres player can click Roar on a predicted Dragon Dance and deny Tyranitar the boost. The primary threat is ironically enough Pursuit Tyranitar, which, while not having Rock Slide, is less affected by Will-O-Wisp due to its usually all-special moveset, and it can use Pursuit to do up to 50% to Moltres as it switches out, setting it up to be KOed at a later point in the game.</p> <p>Zapdos has the special bulk to switch in once against any of Moltres's attacks, is unaffected by Spikes, and forces out Moltres with its STAB Thunderbolt. Starmie and Jolteon both outrun Moltres comfortably and threaten to dispatch it with their STAB attacks, and both can be EVed to switch in safely once. The above are primarily offensive checks though and are sometimes better used to force Moltres out after a KO rather than trading large amounts of HP to provide a one-time switchin. In a similar vein, Rock Slide Salamence and Aerodactyl can also be used to revenge kill Moltres, but they cannot switch in safely due to the risk of being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the standard offensive Moltres, wielding a STAB Fire-type move in conjunction with Hidden Power Grass to cover the majority of the metagame. The Fire-type move is dependent on choice—Fire Blast does more damage, securing the OHKOs against defensive Metagross and specially defensive Skarmory, whereas Flamethrower only gives favorable rolls with a Modest nature. At the same time, Flamethrower's greater PP and accuracy are hard to pass up, and it makes for a more consistent option on defensive teams. Hidden Power Grass destroys Swampert while doing decent damage to Suicune and Milotic and 3HKOing Tyranitar, warding the dinosaur off. Will-O-Wisp covers the handful of checks to Fire + Grass coverage—Salamence in particular—as well as bulkier Pokemon like Snorlax and Tyranitar that may attempt to switch in by crippling their offensive ability. The value of the chip damage that Will-O-Wisp can force onto Pokemon such as Blissey, Suicune, and Milotic cannot be overstated, especially in conjunction with sand and Spikes.</p> <p>Roar is generally the preferred fourth move, phazing bulkier Water-types and Blissey that otherwise switch in freely and forcing them to repeatedly take damage from Spikes. It also interrupts semi-Baton Pass chains that rely on Celebi to set up Calm Minds freely, stops Lum Berry + Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up for free unless it is the last Pokemon on the field, and generally takes advantage of the free turns Moltres is good at creating. Overheat can be paired with Flamethrower as an alternate Fire-type STAB attack, and with a Modest nature it threatens certain OHKOs that Fire Blast doesn't; primarily a 25% chance to put specially defensive Gengar into range of sand, and a 75% chance to OHKO uninvested Celebi and Jirachi after they've used Calm Mind once, forcing an opponent to think twice about staying in. Having two Fire-type STAB attacks allows Moltres to chip certain Pokemon like Zapdos and weakened Blissey and lull them into a false sense of security before blasting through them with Overheat, but all of the above comes at the cost of the momentum loss due to Overheat's stat drops. Protect is another option for a fourth move that allows you to rack up burn damage and scout against Choice Band users like Salamence and Aerodactyl that may be used to force Moltres out.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Moltres Speed tie opposing Moltres while providing as much power as possible. A Modest or Timid nature can be used depending on priorities; Timid allows Moltres to outrun neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon and Jolly Heracross, while Modest's power can be particularly helpful in conjunction with Fire Blast or Overheat. The choice is generally up to the player. Moltres is usually best wielded as an early-game attacker, switching into Skarmory and Metagross and threatening to fire off attacks at will, but it must wary of a potential Toxic when switching in, as Toxic ruins Moltres's longevity. Moltres can also pivot well into Will-O-Wisps from Gengar early-game to take pressure off Blissey and Tyranitar without losing momentum.</p> <p>Moltres naturally draws comparisons to Charizard, which fills a similar niche but with a higher Speed tier and greater offensive presence. Charizard's access to Focus Punch allows it to single-handedly muscle through Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Blissey, all of which Moltres needs time and support to break through. Furthermore, its ability Blaze allows it to trade HP to boost Fire Blast's damage and wallbreaking power in a way Moltres can't, and its ability to Speed tie positive-natured base 100s like Zapdos and Jirachi can come in clutch. However, Charizard lacks the support options that Moltres has, and it lacks Special Attack compared to Moltres, being forced to rely on the more inaccurate Fire Blast for damage. In general, Moltres's defensive utility allows it to carve out a spot on Spikes teams, while Charizard fits better as a breaker on non-Spikes offense, although neither Pokemon is necessarily limited to said archetype.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support is hugely valued considering how this set's best switch-ins are Blissey, Suicune, and Milotic, followed by Rest Snorlax and Lum Berry Tyranitar. Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster all work well as partners and can somewhat act as checks to physical attackers while appreciating Moltres's ability to handle Calm Mind Celebi and Jirachi and OHKO Attack-boosted Metagross. Tyranitar's sand also goes a long way towards punishing Blissey and Suicune by denying them the passive recovery of Leftovers.</p> <p>Having a dedicated special wall is also hugely appreciated considering the threat that Pokemon like Zapdos, Starmie, and Jolteon pose to Moltres. All of Blissey, Snorlax, and Wish Jirachi can fill this role reasonably well. A dedicated Rock-type answer and physical defender like Swampert or Metagross, both of which can switch into Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, is just about required alongside Moltres given its severe weakness to Rock Slide users—Swampert tends to fit on more defensive lineups and also is a better overall Salamence check, while Metagross works on offense and can still thwart most of Choice Band Salamence's attacks. Additionally, Metagross can be used to demolish Blissey, which Moltres hugely appreciates. Defensive Flygon answers Tyranitar and Aerodactyl while being Spikes immune and checking Hidden Power Grass Electric-types in the short term, and it appreciates Moltres's ability to flambé Metagross, which Flygon struggles to switch into. Their shared Spikes immunity makes for a good defensive backbone for Superman-style teams, which are characterized by forgoing a Rapid Spin user or Magneton in favor of running multiple Pokemon immune to Spikes.</p> <p>Electric-types like Zapdos and Jolteon can slam defensive Water-types like Milotic and enjoy Moltres's ability to bully defensive Celebi and Wish + Protect Jirachi. Celebi's defensive and offensive sets provide a more consistent check and switch-in to said Water-types while appreciating Moltres's ability to destroy Steel-types and opposing Celebi. Furthermore, Celebi's Leech Seed in conjunction with Moltres's Will-O-Wisp and the sand and Spikes that usually partner with Moltres makes for a vicious slow burn that gradually wears opposing teams down to nothing, while offensive Celebi can pass Calm Mind boosts that make Moltres even more devastating offensively.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass is a STAB attack that prevents Bayleef from being completely disabled by Taunt and allows it to beat Huntail and Pupitar more easily, but the move is extraordinarily weak in most situations.</p> <p>The EV spread is extremely customizable, so its Special Defense and Defense EVs along with the nature can be altered to augment Bayleef's bulk according to whatever a particular team needs most. Calm is the suggested nature to lessen the damage received from a plethora of special attackers, including Flareon and Huntail. Bayleef should only be used with Pokemon that appreciate the ability to set up more easily, such as Crawdaunt, Lickitung, Hitmonchan, Huntail, Sableye, and Chimecho. Bayleef should not be used as a lead, however, as it loses to many common leads such as Glalie as well as other Taunt users and gets set up on by others. Bayleef is able to set dual screens versus some more passive variants of Pokemon like Wailord and Roselia, so it should try to find opportunities to do so throughout the match. Leech Seed is useful for providing passive recovery to teammates, as well as forcing switches to allow teammates to get in safely or set up freely. Taunt and Toxic can both render Bayleef completely useless, so they should be scouted for adequately.</p>"

Toxic is nothing new as an alternative and can work well on something as bulky as Meganium.Substitute + Leech Seed is an interesting combination that should always be mentioned, but Meganium is really too slow to abuse it.</p> <p>Swords Dance can power up physical moves, but you're probably better off using Victreebel for the STAB on Sludge Bomb. Giving Meganium Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice will allow you to cover more Pokemon types. Finally, if you are paranoid about being statused, Rest over Synthesis is an option. Don't try Sunny Day or Solar Beam, though; use Vileplume or Exeggutor for that.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you plan to use Reflect, you'll want to get more Special Defense than suggested above.

          "description": "<p>Quilava functions primarily as an offensive special attacker that can pressure bulkier teams thanks to its powerful STAB moves and excellent Speed tier. Fire Blast is used as Quilava's preferred STAB move to break through damaged teams without relying as heavily on Blaze or Petaya Berry. Despite the drop in damage output, Flamethrower is a reliable alternative that comes with improved accuracy and more PP. Hidden Power Grass provides coverage versus Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Corsola, Chinchou, Onix, and Rhyhorn. Hidden Power Water hits Ponyta while still threatening Pokemon like Onix and Rhyhorn. Substitute is used for its synergy with the ability Blaze; it also maximizes Toxic damage, and takes advantage of Petaya Berry or Salac Berry. Quilava also tends to force its foes out, which can allow it to set up a Substitute. Toxic threatens special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, and Noctowl, and it can punish Ponyta trying to switch in on Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Quick Attack is a great countermeasure to Substitute + pinch Berry sweepers like Abra and Beedrill as well as against Flail and Reversal users like Doduo and Meditite. 216 Speed EVs allow Quilava to outspeed base 75 Speed Pokemon like Anorith and Doduo, and it can invest its remaining EVs into bulk to guarantee survival against Silk Scarf Ponyta's Quick Attack at 25% HP and a Double Edge from Choice Band Ponyta at Full health. With the added bulk, Quilava can also guarantee that it can still use Substitute after taking Silk Scarf Ponyta's Double Edge at full health. This bulk even allows for Quilava to survive a Double-Edge from Choice Band Ponyta. Petaya Berry turns Quilava into an even scarier special attacker that can OHKO a majority of the tier, and 2HKO special walls like Delcatty, Drowzee, and Noctowl. Salac Berry enables Quilava to threaten a sweep versus faster Pokemon within the tier like Abra, Elekid, Ponyta, and Voltorb. This allows Quilava to function as a late-game sweeper against faster teams.</p> <p>Quilava fits well on balance, offense, and sun teams that benefit from its stellar Special Attack. Its ability to deal heavy damage to more defensive options like Corsola, Lileep, and Koffing enables physical attackers like Aipom, Doduo, and Meditite. While Quilava can threaten Ponyta with Toxic and Hidden Power Water, it may not always get the chance to, so it benefits greatly from defensive Normal-resistant Pokemon and Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Corsola, Lileep, Nosepass, Onix, and Rhyhorn, as they can handle physical attackers like Aipom and Ponyta. Water-types like Corsola, Seaking, and Wartortle can also threaten Quilava, and Hidden Power Grass won't do enough against healthy Water-types with decent Special Defense. This makes Electric-types like Elekid, Flaaffy, and Voltorb a great asset for Quilava to deal with Water-types. Late-game, Quilava can threaten a KO with the assistance of a Petaya Berry. Until that is feasible, Quilava needs the support of a special wall like Delcatty, Gloom, Porygon, or Wartortle for its ability to shrug off most special attacks. Clerics like Flaaffy and Mightyena can allow Quilava to not be as hindered by fear of Thunder Wave, Stun Spore, or Toxic.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass provides useful coverage against Water- and Rock-types such as Corsola, Chinchou, and Onix. Quick Attack assists in picking off weaker, faster attackers such as Abra and Elekid. In combination with a Chesto Berry, Rest heals Quilava instantly, clearing all status conditions and providing greater longevity. If Quilava is in Blaze range, it threatens to OHKO Pokemon such as Flaaffy, Koffing, and stallbreaker Mightyena, making it a juggernaut at breaking down foes. Quilava frequently switches in against Gloom and Dustox, which can threaten to wear it down with status. With the combination of Rest and Chesto Berry, Quilava can switch in without the worry of being affected by paralysis or poison.</p> <p>ChestoRest Quilava performs best on offensive teams that benefit from its ability to weaken special walls and ignore status conditions. Paralysis spreaders like Porygon and Drowzee give Quilava a difficult time when it tries to break them down, so paralysis absorbers like Cubone and Rhyhorn that are immune to Thunder Wave can help deal with Quilava's checks. Other physical wallbreakers such as Anorith and Doduo can thwart special walls Quilava is unable to break like Drowzee and Tentacool. Special attackers such as Clamperl and Wailmer soften up special walls, allowing Quilava to clean up. Bulky Water-types such as Seaking and Wartortle are difficult to break down, as Quilava's Hidden Power Grass inflicts insufficient damage against them. Grass-types such as Gloom and Sunflora tank special attacks from Chinchou and Wartortle and possess reliable recovery. Quilava benefits from paralysis spreaders such as Castform, Nosepass, and Porygon, allowing it to eliminate faster threats such as Aipom and Elekid. Clerics such as Delcatty and Mightyena are appreciated by Quilava, as they help awaken it after consuming its Chesto Berry.

In addition to boosting Quilava's damage output, Sunny Day deters potential Water-type checks such as Clamperl and Chinchou by reducing the damage of Water-type moves. Substitute allows Quilava to safely get itself into Petaya Berry range and blocks potential status from Castform and Drowzee, which may weaken Quilava. Quilava can also safely get into Blaze range with Substitute. Hidden Power Ground is used to threaten a 2HKO against Ponyta and a 3HKO against Tentacool. When Quilava is reduced to Petaya Berry and Blaze range, it can use sun-boosted Fire Blast to OHKO physically defensive Lileep and Rhyhorn. Fire Blast also provides a 68.8% chance to OHKO specially defensive Delcatty. A Naive nature is preferred over Hasty, as it makes it more difficult for Quick Attack users such as Doduo and opposing Quilava to pick it off.</p> <p>Sunny Day Quilava fits well on sun and offense teams, functioning as a powerful wallbreaker. Chlorophyll users like Gloom, Sunflora, Tropius, and Weepinbell can benefit from Quilava setting up sun. Quilava is also able to break through special walls such as Delcatty and Porygon, enabling its teammates to clean. Bulky Water-types such as Corsola and Wartortle wall this set, so Pokemon such as Gloom and Sunflora are able to pick off bulky Water-types for Quilava. Each Chlorophyll user can set up Sunny Day, powering up Fire Blast and reducing the need for Quilava to set up sun for itself, as it is somewhat frail. Quilava values paralysis spreaders like Castform and Porygon hindering opposing Chlorophyll threats as well as faster Pokemon like Ponyta and Volbeat. Physical wallbreakers such as Anorith, Cubone, and Choice Band Seaking are appreciated by Quilava, as they help break special walls like Drowzee and Noctowl. Pokemon such as Onix and Koffing are capable of dealing with faster threats like Aipom for Quilava and its Chlorophyll partners if sun isn't up, and they can set sun for it as well.</p>"

Quick Attack helps to pick off Abra and other weakened faster attackers. Hidden Power Grass is Quilava's best attack against Rock-types, as it helps shred Corsola, Onix, and Rhyhorn, which would otherwise safely switch into Quilava's Fire-type attacks.

This set works best as a late-game sweeper when counters to Typhlosion have been weakened enough for it to finish them off with Flamethrower.

  "Ampharos": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Ampharos makes a name for itself as the best cleric and Electric-type in ADV UU. In a metagame where teams are filled with multiple Pokemon using Toxic or spreading paralysis, Heal Bell is one of the most valuable utility tools for sustaining both offensive and defensive Pokemon, and Ampharos is very effective at using it. Ampharos is a common switch-in to the tier's plethora of Water- and Electric-types by virtue of having impressive mixed bulk coupled with a great ability in Static, which is good at punishing weak contact moves like Rapid Spin, Thief, and Scyther's Aerial Ace. Ampharos isn't a completely passive wall, however, as it is blessed with an astounding base 115 Special Attack stat, which is tied for the highest in the tier with Omastar. This means that it doesn't need much investment to match the power of other Electric-types. Ampharos is a staple on a wide variety of teams that need its cleric support, from balance to bulky offense, working on both Toxic spam and paralysis spam archetypes.</p> <p>However, what can hinder Ampharos as a wall is its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers. This, in conjunction with its poor base Speed, means it has trouble switching in repeatedly when Spikes are up. While Heal Bell is a good support option, its low 8 PP is also a problem for Ampharos, meaning it has to use its opportunities to use Heal Bell wisely, lest it gets overwhelmed by foes repeatedly statusing it. Many Pokemon can also use Heal Bell as an entry point, including powerful wallbreakers such as offensive Kangaskhan and Choice Band Solrock. The tier's common physical attackers usually run Ground-type moves, which Ampharos doesn't like taking due to its lower physical bulk, and even Water-types like Blastoise and Walrein can use Earthquake to keep Ampharos from repeatedly switching in. Finally, while Ampharos deals decent neutral damage, it can fall short of breaking past specially bulky targets like Kangaskhan and Cradily, often relying only on Toxic and Spikes pressure to make progress against them.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch can be used over a status move with a Quiet nature to break past Kangaskhan, but it reduces Ampharos's ability to make progress using status, and it isn't guaranteed to 2HKO Kangaskhan with Defense investment. Protect can be used instead of a status move for Ampharos to gain more Leftovers recovery, scout Choice Band users such as Solrock, and guard itself against Explosion from Pokemon like Qwilfish and Electrode. Rest can be used with a secondary cleric to give Ampharos recovery and preserve Heal Bell PP for itself. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative Hidden Power choice to be able to deal meaningful damage on Lanturn without resorting to Toxic, and it hits Golem and Quagsire 4x super effectively. However, Hidden Power Ice is preferred for more common checks to Ampharos. Counter can be used to get a surprise KO on some physical attackers that threaten Ampharos, but it has higher risk than reward compared to other consistent options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan walls Ampharos with great special bulk and Early Bird Rest to nullify status. Kangaskhan's Speed also means it will get the jump on Ampharos to pressure with a Normal-type STAB move or to recover off damage it takes from Thunderbolt with Spikes up. Even if Kangaskhan isn't going the bulky route, its offensive sets are able to severely dent Ampharos while avoiding Static when using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types can find entry on Thunderbolt and proceed to scare out Ampharos. Nidoqueen is a bulky wallbreaker with a Toxic immunity that can use its entry to pressure Ampharos's team with strong coverage and Sludge Bomb poisons, which puts the onus on Ampharos to come back in to use Heal Bell to clear the poison, circling back around to giving Nidoqueen entry again. Quagsire and Camerupt's unique typings allow them to not be affected by BoltBeam coverage, which lets them stonewall Ampharos and apply pressure to its team. Other Ground-types such as Gligar, Golem, Sandslash, and Nidoking can find entry, but they take more damage from Hidden Power Ice and have to be more careful when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types are able to come in and wall Ampharos, with their weakness to Hidden Power Ice being offset with bulk and instant recovery. Cradily is a prime Ampharos check despite its vulnerability to Toxic. It has great special bulk that lets it shrug off Hidden Power Ice, packs super effective coverage in Earthquake to punish passive plays like Toxic and Heal Bell and threaten a 3HKO, and has Recover with 32 PP, which means unlike other Grass-types that rely on Synthesis or Moonlight, its recovery option can be used liberally over the course of a game. Vileplume is immune to Toxic while having Leech Seed and Moonlight to outlast Ampharos with recovery, and it makes progress through Sludge Bomb poisons or even setting up Swords Dance. Roselia and Cacturne enter on Ampharos to set up Spikes, with Roselia preventing Ampharos from making progress due to its Toxic immunity and Synthesis and Cacturne exerting pressure with Encore and Counter.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is able to check itself due to its huge bulk, and it can force opposing Ampharos to burn Heal Bell PP by repeatedly using status moves. Lanturn can find entry on Ampharos with Volt Absorb healing off any prior damage it takes, meaning it can stonewall Ampharos due to its BoltBeam resistance. Lanturn can protect itself against status from Ampharos by using Substitute or Rest, and can pressure it by battering it down with Surf or forcing it to burn Heal Bell PP by using Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Muk's enormous special bulk, coupled with a Toxic immunity, allows it to come in on Ampharos and break open holes in Ampharos's team, or even pose a threat to sweep with Curse + Rest.</p>",

        "Cleric": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Ampharos is a team's primary user of Heal Bell, which allows it to absorb status and cure its teammates of their own status, increasing the longevity of bulkier teammates or keeping offensive threats healthy, both of which include itself. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit Grass- and Ground-types such as Vileplume, Cradily, and Gligar. Most Ground-types besides Nidoqueen are 2HKOed by it, while Gligar is OHKOed, making their entry risky if Ampharos makes correct predictions. Toxic lets Ampharos make progress against defensive cores and cripple its checks that aren't immune to Toxic such as Kangaskhan, Lanturn, Cradily, Hypno, and opposing Ampharos. Thunder Wave is an alternative status option to hinder the Speed of Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Arcanine on paralysis spam structures.</p> <p>Maximum HP and 88 Defense EVs let Ampharos avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Bug, and 120 Special Defense EVs prevent a 3HKO from Lapras's Ice Beam. 16 Speed EVs are also used to outspeed certain defensive Omastar spreads.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ampharos pairs well with nearly every Pokemon in the tier, but it especially appreciates teammates that can help sustain its longevity or pose an offensive threat. Kangaskhan provides Ampharos Wish support, spreads status through Toxic or Body Slam, and absorbs status from Ampharos's checks to maintain Heal Bell PP. Omastar checks most physical attackers that can threaten Ampharos, and it provides Spikes support that helps Ampharos threaten its checks upon switching in, since most of them aren't Spikes immune. If a Rapid Spin user tries to remove Omastar's Spikes, Ampharos can find entry and punish their attempt at spinning with Static. Omastar can also reliably run Rest with cleric support, keeping it healthy to check physical attackers long-term. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop is appreciated for Ampharos to comfortably switch into the things it checks. Vileplume partners well with Ampharos, as its bulk and multitude of recovery options allow it to check Kangaskhan and opposing Ampharos, and it provides extra status support through Sludge Bomb poisons or Stun Spore. Pokemon that pose sweeping threats help Ampharos's team establish a long-term offensive threat to mitigate some of Ampharos's own passivity. Long-term win conditions with Rest such as Slowking, Xatu, and Curse users like Walrein, Lapras, and Muk are great in this role, as they are at their most threatening when backed by cleric support to reduce the number of turns they are asleep. Ampharos is one of the best leads in the tier, as it checks common leads such as Qwilfish, Granbull, and Walrein, and it can stalemate with other Electric-type leads like Ampharos and Electabuzz. However, it can also be useful outside of the lead position to preserve its health until it needs to switch in against Water- and Electric-types.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Bellossom is awesome. Despite facing direct competition from Tangela as a Sunny Day sweeper, Bellossom has risen above its competition due to its high special bulk, good speed and power, and access to Sleep Powder. Tangela's perks are that it is faster and a little stronger, but Bellossom's higher bulk allows it to set up on and countersweep one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier: Huntail. This trait alone gives Bellossom a major niche in a tier sorely lacking in solid answers to the rain menace. While Bellossom is typically seen as a Sunny Day sweeper, it also has a very effective specially defensive set that can counter some very dangerous Pokemon in the tier, including Chimecho, Plusle, and Haunter. Overall, Bellossom is a solid pick in NU and is worth building a team around.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A SubSeed set can be brutal if used correctly, as there are very few phazers in NU and only a couple of viable Grass-types. Roselia is a huge roadblock that would need to be overcome before attempting to bring this set, but with it gone Bellossom could wreak havoc on slower teams. Hidden Power Psychic is Bellossom's best move for a few of its common switch-ins such as Swalot, Arbok, Golbat, Haunter, Roselia, and Hitmonchan, but this comes at the cost of being completely walled by Steel-types and gives Murkrow a much safer switch in. RestTalk can be used to make Bellossom very durable and more carefree about status, but Bellossom's biggest highlights are access to Sleep Powder and Moonlight, both of which don't work too well on a RestTalk set. Swords Dance can be used, and Bellossom actually has a decent Attack stat to make use of it, but Bellossom has a pretty barren physical movepool that includes only Return, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power. Finally, Petal Dance or Magical Leaf can be used anywhere Giga Drain and Hidden Power Grass are mentioned, but the secondary healing and higher power of the latter two are more desirable compared to the locked-in nature of Petal Dance and the lower power of Magical Leaf.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Swalot, particularly RestTalk variants, utterly walls Bellossom to kingdom come. It fears no move that Bellossom can throw at it—even Hidden Power Psychic will fail to 3HKO specially defensive Swalot—and Giga Drain and Leech Seed will backfire on Bellossom because of Liquid Ooze. Flareon and Torkoal only dislike the status that Bellossom can throw their way, and in return they can completely roast Bellossom with their Fire-type STAB moves. Murkrow will take a decent chunk of damage from Bellossom's attacking moves, but it's immune to Sleep Powder and will annihilate Bellossom with Drill Peck. Pidgeot and Golbat have an easier time switching into Bellossom save for not being immune to Sleep Powder and can threaten back with Aerial Ace. Arbok and Seviper can tank anything Bellossom can throw at them (Seviper even has a chance to activate Shed Skin to get rid of Sleep Powder), and in return they'll KO Bellossom with Sludge Bomb. Kecleon can be taken advantage of because of Color Change, but it will be able to easily tank any of Bellossom's moves and retaliate with Return or Thunder Wave. Venomoth, Glalie, and Roselia will take a decent chunk of damage from Hidden Power Fire, especially in the sun, but outside it they can threaten Bellossom back with their STAB moves.</p>",

        "Sunny Day Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>This set is best used as a late-game sweeper, hopefully once the opponent's Fire-, Poison-, and Fire-types have been sufficiently weakened. The idea is simply to get Bellossom in, set up Sunny Day, and pummel the foe with Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire. Sleep Powder is Bellossom's ace in the hole, allowing it to safely switch out of a dangerous situation or potentially break through a foe that it wouldn't normally have a chance against, such as Golbat or Flareon. With Sunny Day up, Bellossom safely outspeeds the entire tier unless the opponent is packing Tangela, and Hidden Power Fire gains a pseudo-STAB boost to give Bellossom great two-move coverage. The major downside to using Bellossom as a weather sweeper compared to its main competition in Huntail is that Bellossom is fairly vulnerable without Sunny Day up; Solar Beam needs to charge without sun and Hidden Power Fire is pretty weak.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Bellossom is as strong as possible while outspeeding the entire tier with Sunny Day up. A Timid nature is certainly doable, as it allows Bellossom to at worst Speed tie other Bellossom in the sun and outspeed as much as possible before setting up Sunny Day, giving it the chance to potentially put something like Modest Huntail or maximum Speed Octillery to sleep with Sleep Powder beforehand. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 100 SpA / 52 SpD / 104 Spe with a Modest nature allows Bellossom to completely avoid the 2HKO from Timid Huntail's Ice Beam while still outspeeding the tier in the sun. The only move on this set that's replaceable is Sleep Powder, which should only be done if sleep moves make an appearance elsewhere on your team. If this is the case, Sleep Powder can be replaced with Moonlight to give Bellossom a ton of longevity in and out of the sun. It can also be replaced with a secondary Grass-type STAB move such as Giga Drain so that Bellossom isn't quite so vulnerable out of the sun.</p> <p>Bellossom 2HKOes a decent portion of the tier but OHKOes very little, highlighting the importance of making sure that Bellossom is saved for the late-game once the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. Flareon and other Fire-types present the largest roadblock to successfully sweeping with Bellossom, as they take a pittance from Bellossom's attacks and gain a super boost to their STAB moves in the sun. Hitmonchan thus makes a good teammate, as it can switch into and weaken or KO the Fire-types in the tier with Earthquake, as well as take on other special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung with its Fighting-type STAB moves. A special mention needs to go to Diglett here, as it can trap and KO the Fire-types in the tier thanks to Arena Trap, as well as take out Swalot and Arbok, guaranteeing they are out of the way for Bellossom later in the match. Flying-types also present a tough obstacle for Bellossom, making a lure like Stun Spore Venomoth a good teammate to cripple them.</p>"

        "Specially Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>By sheer stats, Bellossom is one of the specially bulkiest Pokemon available in the NU tier, and this set attempts to make the most of that fact. This set should be used on teams that need a solid counter to Huntail, Haunter, and Plusle in one slot, which other similar specially bulky Pokemon like Dewgong and Flareon cannot provide. Otherwise, Roselia will probably fit better on teams in this Bellossom's place due to the Spikes it provides. Sleep Powder is one of the major draws to using Bellossom, and it is almost non-negotiable on this set in order to cripple dangerous offensive Pokemon looking to use Bellossom as setup bait. Giga Drain is recommended as the primary STAB move due to the secondary healing it provides, although Hidden Power Grass is a viable alternative, as it is stronger and has way more PP. Stun Spore pairs very well with Sleep Powder and can cripple common switch-ins to Bellossom like Murkrow to allow for a teammate to sweep later in the match. Toxic is a good alternative in the third slot, as it will allow Bellossom to beat other defensive Pokemon like Sableye and Chimecho one-on-one. The last slot goes to Moonlight to provide Bellossom with a reliable source of healing and allow it to effectively counter Huntail throughout the match.</p> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment is recommended so that Bellossom is bulky enough to take on Huntail and other special attackers throughout the match. Some Defense investment can be run so that Bellossom is better equipped to check the Rock-types in the tier, although Bellossom requires significant investment to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Relicanth and Graveler, and at that point you're probably better off using Tangela. Protect is the most prominent alternative that should be put over Moonlight, as it can help Bellossom stall for Toxic damage and scout Choice Band attackers' moves. Hidden Power Fire is usable in the last moveslot to ward off opposing Grass- and Bug-types that will otherwise have an easy switch into Bellossom, particularly Roselia, since it also doesn't mind status thanks to Natural Cure.</p> <p>Defensive Bellossom fits best on balance teams as part of a defensive backbone to support frailer attackers that need a safety net against a variety of special threats in a single teamslot. With Bellossom covering these, a physically defensive teammate is needed to complete the core. Relicanth is highly recommended for this reason, as they have fantastic synergy together; Sableye and Wailord are also good teammates to consider. Bellossom tends to force a lot of switches because of the status that it throws out, meaning it fits particularly well on Spikes-centered teams. To avoid stacking type weaknesses, Glalie therefore makes the best Spiker to pair with Bellossom. Swalot completely mangles this set thanks to Liquid Ooze and its fantastic special bulk, making a teammate that can eliminate it like Chimecho or Piloswine much appreciated. Chimecho also helps significantly with Roselia, and in return Bellossom covers Huntail and Dark-type attacks aimed Chimecho.</p>"

Perhaps just as importantly, Earthquake lets it deal chip damage to Porygon and Wailmer that doesn’t knock them into range of eating their Sitrus Berry. Shadow Ball can do the same to just Wailmer, only less consistently. Thief lets Snubbull stay healthy with some consistency and punish anything trying to switch into it by making them much more easily KOed through depriving them of their Sitrus Berry healing, and in Porygon’s case, Thief removes its ability to repeatedly heal using Recycle. 116 HP EVs and 36 Defense EVs are enough to comfortably switch into plenty of physically attacking threats like Diglett, Larvitar, Anorith, and, most importantly, Doduo. Specifically, it lets Snubbull live all but one roll of +1 Larvitar and Diglett’s Earthquake and -1 Choice Band Doduo’s Double-Edge. 196 Attack EVs on top of its high base 80 Attack allow it to directly threaten most of the tier with its STAB Return and do major damage to Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types with its coverage options. 36 Speed EVs mostly just cannot be reallocated anywhere more useful, but they do allow it to outspeed common Porygon sets as well as Duskull.</p> <p>Snubbull has two main strengths that lead to easy synergies: its ability to beat major offensive threats like Doduo and Abra, and its ability to spam Thunder Wave.

Stacking multiple Doduo counters on a team like Snubbull and Duskull is another option that can create a situation where the opponent’s Doduo becomes merely a momentum sink for them, giving teammates that are checked by Doduo, like offensive Wailmer, chances to fire off attacks uninhibited. Slower offensive threats like Cubone and Trapinch, as well as really any Pokemon that makes use of Substitute, can also benefit greatly from Snubbull’s presence as a Thunder Wave spammer Paralyzing a Pokemon with extremely high Speed, like Elekid or Abra, can even flip crucial matchups for fast, but not quite fast enough teammates like Doduo, Houndour, Anorith, and the aforementioned offensive Wailmer.</p>"

Granbull is also very slow to where even defensive Pokemon such as Omastar and Ampharos are able to move before Granbull can respond, limiting its offensive pressure and hurting its ability to switch in, especially when Spikes are up. Granbull's Normal typing means it lacks key resistances that other physical walls such as Omastar and Hitmontop have, meaning if it hasn't used Intimidate on a physical attacker, it can't fall back on its typing to check the opposing threat.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Granbull can run SubPunch to ease prediction on its switch-ins, being a great lure to Cradily, as its Substitute isn't broken by Cradily's hits. However, Granbull usually ends up being too slow to use Substitute to effectively block status moves, and it often isn't specially bulky enough for its Substitute to survive weaker hits from Misdreavus and Blastoise. This leaves it less effective than SubPunch Kangaskhan, which is faster, specially bulkier, and can put up 101 HP Substitutes to live a Seismic Toss from Hypno, Clefable, or Sableye. Granbull can be purely defensive support by running Body Slam + Heal Bell + RestTalk, which provides cleric support while maintaining the recovery of Rest to preserve Heal Bell PP. However, this set is flawed by its overall passivity and reliance on PP stalling to check physical attackers, a tall task with the set's meager PP. Despite RestTalk keeping Granbull active while asleep, Granbull can't burn sleep turns if it switches after using Sleep Talk, and it can't rely on a cleric to cure its sleep, since Granbull itself is acting as the cleric. Thunder Wave can be used on utility sets to consistently paralyze opponents without using Body Slam, allowing Granbull to run a stronger STAB option. On Bulk Up sets, Granbull can run Chesto Berry with Rest to instantly heal itself without having to stay asleep, but Leftovers is the preferred item, as the passive recovery is more valuable and consistent. Granbull can run Thief with no item to remove Leftovers from bulky Pokemon and capitalize on the switches it forces, but despite that, it competes with other moveslots in Granbull's typical sets that can be more useful on a game-to-game basis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Omastar</strong>: Omastar's massive Defense and Normal resistance allows it to comfortably take hits from Granbull while not being too bothered by its coverage options. It can use its entry to set Spikes for the benefit of its team and hurt Granbull's ability to switch in or pressure Granbull with a strong Surf. However, Omastar is susceptible to Body Slam paralysis when switching in, and Granbull can punish Omastar switching in or using Spikes with Earthquake or Focus Punch.</p> <p><strong>Cradily</strong>: Cradily is a Rock-type that isn't weak to Granbull's Earthquake. It can use Recover to instantly heal any damage Granbull deals, outlasting it long-term, and Toxic to place Granbull on a turn limit and force it to use Rest, which grants entry for one of Cradily's offensive teammates. However, Cradily doesn't deal any meaningful damage to Granbull outside of Toxic, which allows Granbull to find opportunities to use Focus Punch as it switches in or tries to use Recover, or sweep with Bulk Up to take advantage of its general passivity. Choice Band Granbull also has enough significant power to muscle through Cradily with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon are physical attackers that can threaten Granbull with super effective damage. Hitmontop can use its good physical bulk and Intimidate to switch into Granbull and threaten it with Brick Break or clear Spikes with Rapid Spin. However, Hitmontop's lack of recovery means it can struggle to switch into Granbull repeatedly without Wish support, and it really struggles to switch into Choice Band Granbull, as it takes up to 70% from Double-Edge. Hitmontop's lack of power also means it can struggle to break past Bulk Up Granbull unless it uses Bulk Up itself. Hitmonlee is better at threatening Granbull thanks to its higher Attack stat and Choice Band, but it can't switch into Granbull without heavy prediction on a Rest or Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: With their immunity to Normal-type moves, Ghost-types can act as reliable pivots into Granbull and even wall it if Granbull lacks Shadow Ball. Misdreavus and Haunter are also immune to Ground, with Haunter being the best check into non-Shadow Ball Granbull, as it can use Will-O-Wisp to passively damage Granbull and Taunt to prevent Granbull from using Rest or Heal Bell. Even with Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp can hurt Granbull's general wallbreaking power, and Haunter can use Destiny Bond to remove Granbull for the benefit of one of its teammates. Sableye lacks the weakness to Shadow Ball that the aforementioned Ghost-types do and can win long-term versus Granbull by virtue of Recover to outlast Granbull and tools like Toxic and Knock Off to hurt Granbull's longevity. Sableye tanks hits well from typical Granbull sets, but Bulk Up or Choice Band variants are able to muscle past it and take advantage of Sableye's lack of immediate pressure.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: While other bulky Water-types besides Omastar don't resist Granbull's attacks, some of them, such as Walrein, Blastoise, and Lapras, are typically resilient at taking its hits in situations where they need to apply pressure and win the interaction. Walrein is the best at doing both, with great physical bulk that lives three Returns and a strong Ice Beam that has odds to 2HKO Granbull. Blastoise has to rely on a 3HKO with Surf but takes hits just as well as Walrein, and Lapras is slightly worse at taking Granbull's hits but consistently 2HKOes it with Hydro Pump. All of them don't appreciate switching into Granbull, though, as they fear the risk of Body Slam paralysis or a powerful Focus Punch for Walrein and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Opposing Granbull is able to switch into Granbull and trade hits, only fearing a potential Focus Punch, and it can use Granbull as setup fodder if it's running Bulk Up. However, it has to be careful switching into Choice Band Granbull with Spikes up, and the opposing Granbull can use Bulk Up to set up on it and counteract Intimidate, potentially forcing stalemates if both have Bulk Up.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Offensive Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Granbull has good utility as an offensive wallbreaker with Intimidate to check opposing physical attackers and Heal Bell to act as a cleric, two notable advantages over offensive Kangaskhan. Return chunks any target that doesn't resist it and is generally a safe move to use, but if the additional damage isn't needed, Granbull can instead run Body Slam to spread paralysis for itself and its team, pressuring Kangaskhan into using Rest early and even pressuring switch-ins such as Omastar and Hitmontop. Focus Punch deals massive damage to Kangaskhan to prevent any attempts at Rest stalling it, and it can hit Granbull checks such as Omastar, Cradily, and opposing Granbull trying to switch in. It also punishes them for playing passively when using Spikes, Recover, or Toxic, respectively. Earthquake requires less prediction while hitting some of the same targets and deals more damage to Poison- and Electric-types such as Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and Ampharos. Shadow Ball is used to give Granbull a reliable way to hit Solrock while also hitting Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter. Heal Bell allows Granbull to absorb status from Kangaskhan and Solrock and cure its teammates of status, helping its longevity and enabling other offensive and defensive threats. Rest, however, gives Granbull long-term recovery and a reliable way to counteract Spikes damage that would otherwise hinder Granbull's ability to consistently switch in.</p> <p>40 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to 3HKO 252 HP / 112 Def Kangaskhan with Return, and the rest of the EVs are put into HP and Defense to help Granbull switch into physical attackers reliably. If Granbull is running Body Slam, 96 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow it to 3HKO maximum HP Kangaskhan and deal more damage with its coverage options. Speed investment can be used if Granbull can sacrifice its defensive EVs. 44 Speed EVs allow Granbull to outspeed minimum Speed Vileplume, and 84 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Omastar and Ampharos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Granbull is good at switching into physical attackers, it still appreciates help preserving its health to check them over the longer course of a game. Kangaskhan provides an excellent defensive synergy by checking special threats that Granbull doesn't comfortably take hits well from, such as Arcanine, Lapras, Walrein, and Ampharos, while also providing valuable Wish support to keep Granbull healthy. Spikes impede Granbull's ability to switch in, so it appreciates Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop, proving especially helpful against teams with Spikes, as Granbull tends to draw in Omastar. Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, and Altaria all provide cleric support in case Granbull is using Rest, as it doesn't like the downtime it has while it is burning sleep turns, which can be troublesome against setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther and Gligar. Granbull also appreciates its own Spikes support, as it likes the extra push of damage on bulky targets, and most of its common switch-ins take Spikes damage. Omastar is a good Spikes setter with Granbull, sharing some of the defensive duties by switching into Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Solrock to set Spikes. Qwilfish and Glalie are also Spikes setters that can threaten physical walls like Omastar with Hidden Power Grass and opposing Granbull, Hitmontop, Walrein, Vileplume, and Blastoise with Explosion, reducing the opposing team's ability to take on Granbull significantly. Since Granbull is slow and can't seal a late-game win by itself, it appreciates fast late-game cleaners that appreciate bulky Pokemon being weakened, such as Scyther, Gligar, and Electabuzz.</p>"
        },
        "Bulk Up": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With Bulk Up, Granbull can turn into a dangerous setup sweeper that uses Intimidate against physical attackers to create opportunities to boost and threaten to 2HKO the entire metagame. Return has good unboosted damage on physically bulky targets such as Kangaskhan, Blastoise, and Walrein and is a safe move to throw out if Granbull doesn't want to commit to a sweep. Body Slam helps spread paralysis for Granbull and its teammates, making it scarier when having to take boosted hits from it, but it fails to reach certain damage thresholds that Return has, making Granbull need more boosts to threaten neutral targets. Earthquake allows Granbull to hit Rock-types such as Omastar and Golem while also avoiding contact abilities such as Static and Poison Point. With enough boosts, Earthquake is also able to provide a meaningful neutral hit into Cradily, which has trouble combating boosted Granbull. Shadow Ball hits Solrock and Ghost-types such as Haunter and Misdreavus, and its perfect coverage is enough to threaten the whole tier. Rest can be used instead of Shadow Ball to give Granbull a means of long-term recovery. However, dropping Shadow Ball makes it prone to being completely walled by Haunter and Misdreavus. Heal Bell can also be run to cure Granbull's own status while also functioning as solid team support, but it doesn't restore Granbull's health, unlike Rest, and it doesn't give Granbull much room to set up due to taking on more of a cleric role.</p> <p>40 Attack EVs are used to 3HKO 252 HP / 112 Def Kangaskhan with unboosted Return and 2HKO it at +1, while the rest are put into HP and Defense to help Granbull switch into physical attackers. If Granbull is running Body Slam, 96 Attack EVs allow it to 3HKO maximum HP Kangaskhan while also making its Attack boosts from Bulk Up more significant. Speed investment can be used by sacrificing Granbull's Defense; 44 Speed EVs allow Granbull to outspeed minimum Speed Vileplume, and 84 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Omastar and Ampharos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulk Up Granbull fits on different teams depending on what last move it's running, often needing different kinds of support between its offensive and defensive synergies. If Granbull is running Shadow Ball, it tends to be used as a more short-term setup sweeper that provides extra insurance into physical threats, allowing it to fit on more aggressive teams like hyper offense nicely. Shadow Ball Granbull especially appreciates Spikes to break through bulky targets, making offensive Spikers such as Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie good teammates. Omastar provides a secondary backbone against physical attackers so that Granbull isn't overwhelmed when switching into them, and Qwilfish and Glalie can threaten physical walls with Explosion to weaken the opposing team and further enable Granbull's sweeping capabilities. Late-game cleaners as Scyther, Gligar, and Electrode, as well as Rain Dance sweepers like Omastar and Gorebyss, appreciate the progress Granbull can make wallbreaking early- to mid-game.</p> <p>If running Rest, Granbull tends to fit more on bulky balance teams that use it as a main source of offense tasked to deal with Kangaskhan and Scyther. Using Rest means that Granbull appreciates cleric support from Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, or Altaria to wake it up so it can sweep with Bulk Up at any stage in the game and keep its threat level high. Although Granbull can switch into physical threats to set up, this is made harder when it has to switch in with Spikes up, making Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop good partners. Wish support from Kangaskhan or Hypno is another way to improve Granbull's longevity and replenish its health for sweeping without making it as reliant on Rest. Bulky special attackers such as Arcanine, Walrein, and Lapras can stand in the way of Granbull's sweep by threatening powerful moves, so it appreciates special walls such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn to take on these threats. Swords Dance users are difficult to deal with when Granbull uses Rest, as they can boost past Bulk Up's defense boosts and Intimidate. Reversal Scyther in particular can take advantage of Granbull's Fighting-type weakness and threaten to countersweep. Thus, Pokemon with priority moves such as Scyther, Gligar, and Arcanine are good for stopping it. Granbull makes a good pairing with Slowking on bulky offense teams, as both fulfill a similar defensive sweeping role and can take on each other's checks. Slowking helps check Water-types and Arcanine, while Granbull helps check Choice Band Scyther and Kangakshan.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Granbull provides more immediate firepower and hits extremely hard, being very threatening to weakened or paralyzed teams. Since Body Slam's damage is buffed by Choice Band, it's the preferred STAB move over Return for its chance to paralyze Granbull's switch-ins and enable its wallbreaking potential, though Return can still be used if the extra damage is preferable for better OHKO potential against Scyther, Gligar, Arcanine, and Lanturn, as well as a consistent 2HKO on Blastoise. Double-Edge from Granbull is one of the hardest-hitting physical attacks in the tier outside of Explosion, doing the impressive feat of being able to OHKO a few bulky Kangaskhan variants while also being generally hard to switch into. Double-Edge should not be used as a move to lead with, though, as the recoil is a huge tax to Granbull's health and should be used once the opposing team is weakened and Granbull finds an opening such as Kangaskhan using Rest. Return acts similarly to Double-Edge as a very powerful hit without the recoil damage, making it safer yet less rewarding as a powerful STAB option. Granbull can also run Focus Punch over its weaker STAB moves as a way to punish Kangaskhan's Rest and potentially OHKO defensive Omastar, Cradily, and Golem switching in. Earthquake hits common Normal- resistant Pokemon such as Omastar and Golem while also avoiding contact abilities such as Static and Poison Point. Granbull can muscle past Cradily and Sableye with Earthquake thanks to the increased damage of Choice Band. Shadow Ball is used to hit Solrock and Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter while also 2HKOing Slowking.</p> <p>Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature allows Granbull to hit as hard as possible in conjunction with Choice Band, and 100 Speed EVs are used to outspeed defensive Omastar and Ampharos. Granbull can also run maximum Speed to be less reliant on paralysis support to outspeed Pokemon like Solrock, Hitmontop, Lapras, and Blastoise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because this Granbull set doesn't have good staying power with the lack of defensive EVs and no Leftovers, it shouldn't be used as a primary check to physical attackers. To remedy this, Granbull should be paired with a reliable physical wall such as Omastar, Golem, or Hitmontop, as they find safer opportunties for entry against Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Solrock. Because Granbull has lacking Speed as a Choice Band user, it appreciates heavy paralysis support to gain the first hit against faster foes, making good pairings with Body Slam Kangaskhan, Thunder Wave Ampharos, and Stun Spore Vileplume to land paralysis on fast Pokemon like Scyther, Gligar, and Arcanine. Spikes makes Choice Band Granbull much more difficult to switch into, so reliable Spikes setters such as Omastar, Qwilfish, Glalie, and Roselia are good partners to enable its dangerous power further. Qwilfish and Roselia in particular help spread paralysis for Granbull, and when paired with Thunder Wave Misdreavus to block opposing Rapid Spin and continue the paralysis support, Granbull makes for a great wallbreaker on Spikes paralysis teams. Since Choice Band Granbull lacks any recovery and can get worn down quickly by Spikes and Double-Edge recoil, Wish support from Kangaskhan and Hypno gives Granbull a means to regain its lost health and offset passive damage. Cleric support from Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, and Altaria is also appreciated, as this Granbull set is more weak to status due to the lack of recovery options. If Granbull locks itself into a Normal-type move for Omastar to find entry on, things can get problematic, as Spikes damage is permanent without Wish support and is further compounded when Granbull takes Double-Edge recoil. Therefore, it appreciates being paired with a Rapid Spin user such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, or Hitmontop to minimize the passive damage it takes.</p>"

If you are using Bulk Up, you may want to lower your Speed to 254 Speed (176 EVs) and put the rest into HP so you can potentially get 2 or more Bulk Ups, as this still allows you to outspeed everything in UU but Timid Electrode, which is extremely rare.</p>"}}

  "Hitmonchan": {
    "ru": {"sets": {"All-out Attacker": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Say hello to what is possibly the most dangerous Pokemon in NU. This dominance is thanks to a lot of factors: a fantastic offensive and defensive typing, great stats, an almost perfect movepool that includes Mach Punch, which is probably the best priority move in a metagame sorely lacking in them, and a huge amount of viable sets, making Hitmonchan pretty unpredictable. Along with all of its amazing qualities, Hitmonchan is also about the only viable Fighting-type available in NU apart from Machoke, giving it a place on every offensive team to crush the common Normal-, Rock-, and Steel-types of the tier. With practically unique access to Rapid Spin, Hitmonchan is a staple on stall and defensive teams as well. Hitmonchan is the reason Sableye and Chimecho are as important and good as they are in the tier, despite Hitmonchan having ways to bypass them and every other counter to it. Prepare well for Hitmonchan, and consider it on every team you make; your teams will likely be made better with its addition.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While there aren't a lot of other sets that Hitmonchan can viably run outside of the ones listed above, it does have a lot of alternate move options that haven't been mentioned in much detail. In particular, Focus Punch can be run on any of the sets mentioned above in place of Hitmonchan's STAB attacks or other moves. It's just generally not recommended, as Sky Uppercut is sufficiently powerful enough for most sets and Focus Punch requires precision prediction that is tough to accomplish without the help of Substitute. Liechi or Salac Berry can be run on any set mentioned above as well to give Hitmonchan a bit more oomph in the late-game that it otherwise wouldn't have. Counter is an interesting and potentially useful option to run with a bit of defensive investment, as most offensive teams' answer to Hitmonchan is to revenge kill it with something like Pidgeot; with some defensive investment, Hitmonchan can theoretically tank the hit and eliminate Pidgeot from the picture in one move, a feat that it otherwise would not be able to accomplish. Revenge is an alternative STAB option on any set not running maximum Speed, as the doubled power if Hitmonchan moves second can definitely be worth it. Hidden Power Bug is available for Hitmonchan to get a strong hit on Tangela and Chimecho, but its effective coverage ends there. A ChestoRest set is doable, giving Hitmonchan some much-needed longevity on its bulkier sets, but Rest costs a moveslot that Hitmonchan typically needs. Finally, Thief is an option over Toxic wherever it's mentioned above as a way to cripple Sableye and other defensive Pokemon like Wailord.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Thanks to being immune to Hitmonchan's STAB moves and taking neutral damage from the rest of Hitmonchan's coverage options, Sableye is Hitmonchan counter numero uno. With maximum Defense, it avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band-boosted Earthquake and can Recover off any damage Hitmonchan throws at it apart from Toxic. Maximum Defense Chimecho is the next best answer to any Hitmonchan, as it is only just 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Hidden Power Ghost, which is relatively easy to pivot out of should Chimecho take the hit, and can set up Reflect on Hitmonchan to soften its other blows. Haunter needs to avoid Hidden Power Ghost at all costs, but it is typically immune to the other three of four moves most Hitmonchan carry, allowing it to easily pick Hitmonchan off with Psychic. Golbat, Pelipper, and Tropius are generally good switch-ins as well, as they only need to fear the uncommon Rock Slide and can eliminate Hitmonchan with Hidden Power Flying. Swalot and Arbok are good initial switch-ins to Hitmonchan but need to be wary of straying into an Earthquake. Venomoth is practically immune to Fighting, only really fears Rock Slide, and can put Hitmonchan to sleep with Sleep Powder. Defensive Tangela takes 40% at most from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut, allowing it to stall Hitmonchan out with Leech Seed and Morning Sun. Finally, Hitmonchan is rather easy to revenge kill with faster physical attackers, particularly Murkrow, Pidgeot, Vigoroth, and Raticate, as long as they avoid Mach Punch.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>This is Hitmonchan's flagship set and one of the most dangerous sets in the tier, with devastating power, speed, and coverage immediately upon entering the field. STAB Fighting-type attacks destroy a huge portion of the tier, and Sky Uppercut is a powerful and reliable attack to batter opposing Pokemon with, especially when backed by the power boost of a Choice Band. Brick Break is a bit weaker, but is 100% accurate and comes with the added benefit of breaking Reflect, which is an otherwise reliable way to soften Hitmonchan's blows. Hidden Power Ghost and Earthquake give Hitmonchan almost perfect coverage alongside its Fighting-type STAB move, with the former destroying Haunter and Chimecho, otherwise good switch-ins, and the latter taking out Swalot and Arbok as well as being Hitmonchan's strongest option against Sableye. The last moveslot is up to how you want Hitmonchan to operate on your team. Mach Punch makes Hitmonchan a safety net option against dangerous late-game sweepers like SubSalac Flail Kingler, Dragon Dance Pupitar, and Choice Band Raticate. Alternatively, Rock Slide completes Hitmonchan's stellar coverage and makes it extremely difficult to switch into safely for defensive teams, eliminating Flying-types like Golbat, Pelipper, and Tropius and Bug-types like Venomoth as decent switch-ins.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to let Hitmonchan Speed tie with other Hitmonchan and ensure it outspeeds Kingler and maximum Speed base 65s, instead of just tying with them as it would with Adamant. Hidden Power Bug can be used to hit both Chimecho and Tangela in one slot, but Haunter is far more dangerous to teams than Tangela if it gets in for free, making Hidden Power Ghost the overall better option. Focus Punch can be used in the last slot if you think you can predict well; the power of a STAB Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch is almost unreal, blasting through neutral targets like Bellossom and 2HKOing bulky targets that Sky Uppercut only 3HKOes such as Wailord. Focus Punch's power is so great, a super effective Hidden Power Ghost only does about 10% more against targets that resist Focus Punch like Chimecho.</p> <p>There are only a few Pokemon that can take on this set without much trouble. Physically defensive Sableye is the most pressing concern for anybody using this set, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can heal off the damage with Recover. Pairing Hitmonchan with a strong special attacker that can blow past Sableye like Seadra or using a teammate that can hit it with Toxic will allow Hitmonchan to eventually break through it. Spikes will also go a long way in allowing Hitmonchan to punch through Sableye and other defensive threats like Swalot, meaning Roselia and Glalie are classic teammates. Any Pokemon that resist Fighting are roadblocks to Choice Band Hitmonchan, as they prevent it from using its powerful STAB moves. Dark-types like Cacturne and special walls like Kecleon can eliminate Fighting-resistant threats like Chimecho and Haunter, and Electric-types like Plusle can remove Pelipper and other Flying-types from the picture. Hitmonchan is rather easy to revenge kill with faster offensive Pokemon like Pidgeot and Murkrow, meaning Mawile is a great teammate; Mawile also comes with the benefit of being able to Baton Pass Substitutes and Swords Dance boosts to Hitmonchan. Keep in mind, though, that the goal is not to necessarily sweep with this Hitmonchan set—it works best as a wallbreaker and safety net. This set should be paired with a dedicated late-game sweeper, such as Dragon Dance Pupitar, SubSalac Flail Vigoroth, or Rain Dance Huntail, to clean up the opponent's team.</p>"
        },
        "Bulk Up": {
          "description": "<p>With Bulk Up, Hitmonchan turns into more of a tank, letting it blow through the Pokemon it's meant to take out and keep on chugging. Being able to switch moves is a big selling point in running Bulk Up over Choice Band, as is the added recovery from Leftovers to deal with Spikes and the greater number of hits Hitmonchan is able to take. Sky Uppercut and Hidden Power Ghost give Hitmonchan great two-move coverage, hitting everything in the tier for sufficient damage once Hitmonchan has enough boosts under its belt. Earthquake prevents Arbok and Swalot from stopping Hitmonchan's sweep, but Mach Punch can be used to pick off weakened attackers like Raticate, Glalie, and Murkrow. The choice comes down to your team. Earthquake makes Hitmonchan more of a wallbreaker and stallbreaker, while Mach Punch makes Hitmonchan a better cleaner and safety net.</p> <p>A bulkier EV spread like 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to make better use of the Defense boosts from Bulk Up, while still outspeeding maximum Speed Jolly Pupitar. This spread features more Attack than the listed spread thanks to the Adamant nature beefing up Mach Punch and effectively making up for the Speed lost. Specially defensive spreads, with varying degrees of defensive investment are also usable, but having immediate Speed and power is what generally makes Hitmonchan so dangerous. Rock Slide can be used in the last slot depending on the needs of your team, in particular giving Hitmonchan super effective coverage on Golbat and Pelipper. Substitute is an option that allows Hitmonchan to better sweep the opponent's team end-game by protecting it from revenge kills from the likes of Flying-types and Chimecho as well as status from Sableye.</p> <p>This set fits best on balance teams that need a way to stallbreak, dismantle common defensive cores, and prevent Sableye and Chimecho from being consistent, reliable answers to Hitmonchan. A big perk to using this set over others is that it's harder for physical threats like Pidgeot and Raticate to revenge kill it, although they still pose a threat should Hitmonchan be sufficiently weakened. Haunter in particular is still a major threat to the success of this set, making generally defensive teammates that can keep offensive pressure up ideal to pair with Hitmonchan; options include Kecleon, Relicanth, and Tangela. This set is stopped cold by Swalot if lacking Earthquake or Substitute, making Chimecho a good partner to take it out; Chimecho can also heal status with Heal Bell.</p>"

        "Bulky Rapid Spin": {
          "description": "<p>Hitmonchan is one of the few Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin in the tier, and it's far and away the most usable, meaning it has a major niche apart from being a super strong Fighting-type. Hitmonchan also has a pretty easy time spinning when needed, as Haunter, Sableye, and Shedinja are the tier's only spinblockers, and only Sableye can repeatedly switch into Hitmonchan without much worry. Hitmonchan also destroys two of the major Spikers in the tier in Cacturne and Glalie and deals a good number on the third, Roselia. All of this makes Hitmonchan a staple on defensive teams, allowing common grounded stall Pokemon like Roselia, Sableye, Flareon, and Relicanth to thrive.</p> <p>A bulky EV spread allows Hitmonchan to more easily come in throughout the game and spin when needed and retains its strength on the battlefield with maximum Attack investment. The moveset is designed to allow Hitmonchan to spin as reliably as possible, with Toxic making an appearance here in the last slot to cripple Sableye and eventually let Hitmonchan win the spin war against it. If you're not concerned by that, Earthquake gives Hitmonchan as much coverage as possible with its other moves, allowing it to get a spin off by forcing switches, if the opponent lacks Sableye that is.</p> <p>The EV spread has enough Speed to outrun Adamant Pupitar before a Dragon Dance, with the rest of the EVs invested in Attack and HP. Mach Punch can be used in the last slot to make Hitmonchan more of a safety net for the slower, defensive teams it'll likely be featured on, letting it check faster threats that can give defensive teams some trouble like Vigoroth and Raticate.</p> <p>Because this set is slower than other Hitmonchan variants, there are a number of Pokemon that can outspeed it and deal a huge amount of damage. This includes dangerous Choice Band attackers like Flareon and Kingler, which can blow right through Hitmonchan's increased bulk with Double-Edge for a near OHKO. With this in mind, this set requires a sturdy backbone to allow it to switch in and out; thankfully, this set fits best on teams that feature such backbones. Relicanth, Mawile, Metang, and Sudowoodo make great physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Hitmonchan. This set has a tougher time with Chimecho than most of its other sets, even with Hidden Power Ghost to beat it back, making a specially defensive teammate to take it down, like Kecleon, a good partner.</p>"
        },
        "SubPunch": {
          "description": "<p>Hitmonchan's Focus Punch is one of the strongest unboosted attacks in the tier and absolutely devastates even those Pokemon that resist it, exposing even the most physically defensive versions of Chimecho to a 2HKO from Focus Punch followed by Hidden Power Ghost. Substitute pairs perfectly with Focus Punch, as it protects Hitmonchan from status and revenge kills and allows Hitmonchan to fire off a Focus Punch guaranteed. The last slot is flexible, with Mach Punch picking off most Pokemon that can break Hitmonchan's Substitute and survive a Focus Punch such as Pidgeot. Earthquake is also usable to muscle through the Poison-types that can comfortably tank Focus Punch and Hidden Power Ghost like Swalot and Arbok and is Hitmonchan's best weapon against Sableye apart from Toxic.</p> <p>The EV spread given makes Hitmonchan as specially bulky as possible while keeping a decent amount of power behind its attacks, in particular allowing its Substitute to survive Giga Drain from 0 SpA Roselia and Surf from 0 SpA Dewgong. If you feel you don't need these benchmarks and want Hitmonchan to hit as hard as possible, a simple 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread is perfectly doable and lets Hitmonchan gain a guaranteed OHKO on 0 HP Pidgeot. This set can be combined with a Liechi or Salac Berry over Leftovers to allow Hitmonchan to sweep in the late-game. If you go this route, it's recommended to place Sky Uppercut in the last slot to give Hitmonchan a STAB move should it be unable to keep its Substitute up. Rock Slide can be used in the last slot, as Hitmonchan tends to lure in Golbat and this set is apt at taking it out along with Pelipper and Venomoth. Finally, Toxic is another option for the last slot as Hitmonchan's best move for Sableye and can allow Hitmonchan to stall for extra chip damage on foes should the need arise.</p> <p>Sableye and physically defensive Chimecho pose a huge barrier to the success of this set, making a very strong special attacker to break through these threats a good teammate. Cacturne in particular can set up Spikes against Sableye to weaken Hitmonchan's other checks and threatens Chimecho out with a STAB Hidden Power Dark. Wish Flareon makes a great partner to this set as well to help recover off the damage Hitmonchan will take from setting up Substitute and to obliterate Sableye with STAB Fire Blast. This set works well as a lure to weaken the opponent's physically defensive Pokemon, opening the door for a late-game sweeper like Kingler or Pupitar to clean up after Hitmonchan throws around a few Focus Punches.</p>"
        },
        "Agility": {
          "description": "<p>This set is pretty unorthodox but can work wonders against frailer, offensive teams should Hitmonchan get a turn to set up. The goal with this set is to set up Agility late-game on a Pokemon Hitmonchan forces out, like Flareon or Kecleon, and proceed to sweep the opponent's team because nothing is able to outspeed it. This set completely turns the tide against otherwise safe checks and revenge killers like Raticate and Haunter, as they are outsped and OHKOed by a boosted Hitmonchan. Sky Uppercut and Hidden Power Ghost give Hitmonchan the coverage it needs to successfully sweep, with the last slot taking out key threats to the success of this set. Rock Slide is recommended here to get as strong a hit on targets like Pidgeot, Golbat, and Venomoth as possible and make use of the possible flinch chance should it come down to it. Earthquake is a strong option as well to make sure Arbok and Swalot cannot stop Hitmonchan's sweep, and it is Hitmonchan's best way to break through Sableye.</p> <p>With the given spread, Hitmonchan is as strong as possible while outspeeding literally everything else in the tier after Agility, even vastly outpacing maximum Speed Tangela in the sun. Due to this, you can drop Hitmonchan's Speed investment down a bit and pump some of those EVs into HP to protect Hitmonchan a bit from foes' priority moves, but outspeeding as much as possible before a boost may be more beneficial to the success of this set.</p> <p>This set should function almost solely as a sweeper, meaning it's going to need teammates to break walls and generally weaken the opponent's team enough to allow it to sweep. In particular, Sableye needs to be removed or weakened sufficiently before Hitmonchan sets up, as it'll otherwise wall Hitmonchan to oblivion. Spikes is the best way to whittle down Sableye down, along with a few of Hitmonchan's other checks, making Glalie and Roselia ideal teammates. Strong special wallbreakers should be next on the list of Hitmonchan's teammates to force the opponent's hand and hopefully get them to sacrifice Sableye or other physically defensive Pokemon. Seadra, Flareon, and Huntail are particularly adept at eliminating Sableye and other Hitmonchan checks from the picture. Alternatively, pairing Hitmonchan with a physically attacking lure to take out Sableye is also doable. Machoke can lure Sableye in and nail it with Toxic, effectively removing its long-term capability to wall both Machoke and Hitmonchan. Other physical attackers like Raticate can punch a hole deep enough into Sableye and Chimecho to allow Hitmonchan to clean up later with Earthquake and Hidden Power Ghost.</p>"

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Hitmontop is one of the tier's few Fighting-types, offering unique role compression by being able to both use Rapid Spin and check the tier's best Pokemon, Kangaskhan. Hitmontop's ability Intimidate isn't just useful for switching into Kangaskhan, however, as it checks a slew of other physical attackers such as Granbull, Nidoqueen, and Solrock, which Hitmontop counters. Its base 110 Special Defense is nothing to scoff at either, letting it take hits and trade with certain special attackers in a pinch such as Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Lanturn. Hitmontop's access to Fighting-type STAB lets it threaten many common Pokemon, and it has a good physical movepool for coverage to back it up.</p> <p>However, while Hitmontop can both check Kangaskhan and use Rapid Spin as dual role compression, it finds itself being less effective at both than the Pokemon it competes with, such as Granbull for the former and Tentacruel and Blastoise for the latter. Hitmontop's meager base 50 HP and lack of reliable recovery means it can have trouble switching in against offensive Kangaskhan variants with Spikes up. Without the Intimidate Attack drop, it also takes heavy damage from the physical attackers it means to check besides Solrock. Hitmontop's onus to use Rapid Spin can also make it passive against Spikes teams, and it tends to invite in dangerous Pokemon such as Scyther and Gligar. Not only this, but Hitmontop can struggle against teams using Misdreavus to spinblock, as Hitmontop does not like wasting its health to Psychic without getting a chance to use Rapid Spin. Hitmontop also has issues offensively; as a Fighting-type, it wants as much coverage as possible but can't fit everything into one set, giving it painful four-moveslot syndrome. Even with the proper coverage, Hitmontop's unimpressive base 95 Attack means it lacks power even against the Pokemon hit super effectively by it, such as Omastar, Walrein, and Cradily.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mach Punch serves as a priority move to check sweepers such as Reversal Scyther, Rain Dance Omastar, and Petaya Berry Electric-types such as Electrode and Manectric. Thief can be used with no item to steal Leftovers from bulky Pokemon such as Ampharos, Tentacruel, and Vileplume. However, Hitmontop has to drop valuable coverage to run it, and it can backfire if Hitmontop accidentally steals a Choice Band from Scyther. Rest can be used alongside a cleric to gain recovery, but it makes Hitmontop much more passive while asleep, and it can't threaten with more coverage. Bulk Up can be used over a coverage option to pose a potential sweeping threat when it finds entry, and Hitmontop can use it to match the boosts of Curse users such as Walrein, Lapras, and Muk. High Jump Kick sounds appealing to threaten Kangaskhan and Omastar more than Brick Break can, but the extra damage is not worth it when considering its less than perfect accuracy and potential for massive recoil damage on a Pokemon that already struggles to preserve its health. Hitmontop can use Endeavor, Mach Punch, Hidden Power Ghost, and Endure with a Salac Berry on a lead set for a surprise way to make progress on offensive teams by breaking holes for offensive teammates to capitalize on, but its general consistency is very low compared to standard Rapid Spin sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Gligar is not hit meaningfully by any of Hitmontop's coverage options, and it can set up Swords Dance to threaten Hitmontop with boosted Hidden Power Flying while not caring about Intimidate thanks to Hyper Cutter. Altaria can sit in on Hitmontop and stall it out with Toxic, as even Rock Slide won't be able to 3HKO physically defensive variants. Scyther can find entry on resisted moves or Rapid Spin and threaten Hitmontop with a strong Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying, but it has to be mindful of Rock Slide when switching in, and Rock Slide Hitmontop can find entry on a Scyther that is Choice-locked into Hidden Power Bug to scare it out. Fearow is similar to Scyther with a stronger Flying-type STAB option in Drill Peck, but finds less entry due to not resisting Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Slowking, Xatu, and Grumpig use their resistance to Fighting to find entry and threaten Hitmontop on the special side. None of them are OHKOed by Hidden Power Ghost, and the Psychic-types that are 2HKOed are faster, which means they win one on one. They can even take advantage of Hitmontop switching out by setting up Calm Mind, which lets them exert a lot of offensive pressure even when Hitmontop removes the Spikes they depend on.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus, Haunter, and Sableye are immune to Brick Break and can spinblock Hitmontop to keep Spikes up. Even though Misdreavus and Haunter's Psychic don't do amazing damage to Hitmontop while Hidden Power Ghost deals good damage to both, they can use it to pressure if Hitmontop's health is low enough. Haunter can also use Destiny Bond to remove Hitmontop for one of its teammates and for Spikes to stay up for the remainder of the battle. Sableye can completely wall Hitmontop lacking Toxic, with tools like Toxic and Knock Off to harm Hitmontop's longevity and Recover to outlast it.</p> <p><strong>Vileplume</strong>: Vileplume doesn't care about any of Hitmontop's coverage, and it can even heal off the damage it takes from Hitmontop with Leech Seed or Moonlight while making progress through spreading status with Sludge Bomb or Stun Spore. Swords Dance variants are also able to take advantage of Hitmontop to pose a sweeping threat while boosting past Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Muk can switch in on Hitmontop to break open holes for its team, only being threatened by Earthquake. Muk can also use Curse + Rest to use Hitmontop as long-term setup fodder to pose a sweeping threat.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Opposing Intimidate hinders the effectiveness of Hitmontop, which already struggles with power. Even Granbull, which is weak to Brick Break, can utilize Intimidate and its great physical bulk to take negligible damage from Hitmontop and potentially set up with Bulk Up. Arcanine doesn't take much damage from Brick Break and threatens Hitmontop with Fire Blast. Opposing Hitmontop are also effective Hitmontop switch-ins, allowing both to reverse Spikes momentum for their teams.</p>",

        "Rapid Spin": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hitmontop finds opportunities to use Rapid Spin by coming in on physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Solrock, as well as a chipped Omastar in 2HKO range for Brick Break, as Hitmontop loses the interaction otherwise. Hidden Power Ghost is needed to check Solrock, and additionally hits other Psychic-types such as Slowking, Grumpig, and Lunatone, as well as Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter, which can spinblock Hitmontop. Hitmontop's third coverage move is important for deciding which Pokemon it will cover while sacrificing other matchups. Earthquake can be chosen to hit Poison-types, such as Tentacruel, Qwilfish, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Muk, and it can hit Electric-types hard without activating Static. Rock Slide is chosen to hit Flying-types such as Scyther, Altaria, and Fearow, usually on the switch in. Toxic helps against irritating walls such as Blastoise, Cradily, Sableye, and Hypno; it also is a generally safe move to use, as it cripples most of Hitmontop's switch-ins without having to guess with a coverage option.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Hitmontop have favored odds to 3HKO Omastar with Brick Break while also dealing important damage to bulky Kangaskhan, Cradily, and Misdreavus. The rest of the EVs are put in HP and Defense to let Hitmontop switch in on physical attackers. More EVs can be placed into Speed to hit benchmarks for outspeeding certain Pokemon; 136 Speed EVs let Hitmontop outspeed offensive Omastar, and 184 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed defensive Kangaskhan variants. However, the extra Speed isn't always worth the loss in bulk unless it's needed for Hitmontop's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Hitmontop lacking reliable recovery, it is rarely seen without Wish Kangaskhan, which helps Hitmontop switch into common Kangaskhan switch-ins, such as opposing Kangaskhan, Omastar, Solrock, and Granbull, over the course of a longer game. Hitmontop is vulnerable to status such as Toxic from Kangaskhan when switching into it, which harms its general longevity, so a cleric such as Ampharos, Aromatherapy Vileplume, or Altaria helps patch up this issue. Hitmontop tends to invite in setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther, Gligar, Curse Muk, and Swords Dance Vileplume, and it lacks power to prevent Curse Lapras, Curse Walrein, and Feraligatr from setting up on it. For this reason, Hitmontop pairs well with a phazer such as Encore Walrein, Roar Blastoise, Roar Altaria, or Perish Song Misdreavus. Hitmontop appreciates Pokemon that can switch into the Flying-types it tends to draw in, including most of the aforementioned Pokemon like Walrein, Altaria, Lapras, and Misdreavus. In return, Hitmontop switches into and checks Solrock, which threatens these Pokemon. Hitmontop can be used in the lead position to Intimidate physical attackers and win the 1v1 against leads like Ampharos, Kangaskhan, Walrein, and Nidoking, or it can be used in the back to switch into physical attackers or Spikers mid-game when it needs to.</p>"

The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Hitmontop is mostly a novelty choice in standard play, but it is one of the few Pokemon who can come in on and force out any kind of Tyranitar. All in all, it is fun to use, but might not be suited for the most competitive teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hitmontop can Rapid Spin, but isn't any good at it. It's easily thwarted by Ghosts and loses to Skarmory more often than not. If your team really needs spin support, it's a good filler though. Triple Kick makes Hitmontop one of the best counters to Substitute Tyranitar in the game; it resists Crunch, has nice Special Defense to buffer Thunderbolt, and can weaken Rock Slide and Focus Punch with Intimidate. As Triple Kick will hit Tyranitar twice after breaking its Substitute, the only way Hitmontop will eat a Focus Punch is on the switch. Toxic and Thief are always decent filler options as well, while Substitute isn't bad on Bulk Up sets to protect against status. Revenge is amped up to a massive 120 Base Power if Hitmontop is hit first, and can be used instead of Counter to beat up special attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As previously alluded to, Hitmontop has a lot of trouble with standard Fighting resists. Zapdos, Salamence, and Gyarados all come in relatively easily on just about any move and really put a hurting on Hitmontop. Weezing can neuter Hitmontop with Will-O-Wisp and doesn't take much damage at all from any of its attacks. Skarmory can lay Spikes and hit it with super effective STAB Flying-type moves. It, along with Salamence and Gyarados, has to be wary of Counter, though. The same applies to Heracross: it can shrug off most of Hitmontop's hits and hurt it with even a resisted Megahorn, but Counter is deadly. Gengar fares well against Hitmontop as long as it doesn't take repeated Rock Slides and stays away from Hidden Power Ghost, while Dusclops can basically shrug off anything.</p>",

Try to take down powerful special attackers on the switch with your third and fourth moves; Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Salamence, and Gyarados, while Hidden Power Ghost hurts Gengar and lets Hitmontop do some damage to Dusclops. Hitmontop makes quite a decent counter to Dragon Dance Tyranitar with Intimidate and resistance to Rock.</p> <p>200 Speed is a good number to hit, but 222 and 244 are options to beat Adamant and Jolly Tyranitar respectively.

Trigger Salac Berry by using Substitute or Endure, then Endeavor foes to that same low HP. If you can, try to Substitute as your opponent switches to a faster Pokemon. Keep up the Substitute by using it every time they attack to break the Substitute, and you should end up at low HP with both a Salac boost and a Substitute up. Now finish them off with Mach Punch or Hidden Power Ghost, and Endeavor the next switch-in.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed are standard sweeper fare, but the remaining EVs should not be put in HP so it can make four Substitutes. Note that even with maximum Speed, +1 Hitmontop cannot hope to outpace Aerodactyl, and that Tyranitar foils this strategy with Sand Stream.</p>"},
        "Counter": {"description": "<p>Hitmontop is pretty good at using Counter. With these EVs, it can switch into Salamence's Dragon Dance, Intimidate it, survive Hidden Power Flying, then Counter for the KO. Other attacks it can successfully Counter include Heracross's Megahorn and Brick Break, Skarmory's Drill Peck, as well as Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Flying. Brick Break is better than High Jump Kick on this set; you don't want Hitmontop to lose HP to a miss as it'll need all the HP it can get for Counter. Protect allows it to scout for moves and Mach Punch to pick off weakened foes. The combination of Salac Berry and Endeavor let Hitmontop hurt one more Pokemon after Countering a nearly deadly hit, while Leftovers is the safer option.</p>"}

      "overview": "<p>Blaziken is a threat to many teams due the diverse ways in which it can sweep. Fire is an excellent attacking type against physical walls, while Fighting hits all common special walls super effectively, and Blaziken has the stats to go either route. However, Blaziken is hampered by its defensively poor typing, which grants it weaknesses to Surf, Earthquake, Hidden Power Flying, and Psychic, four of the most common and dangerous moves around. On the other hand, its 4x Bug resistance is incredibly handy. Blaziken has slightly above average Speed, but due to its need to split offensive EVs, it is slower than most Pokemon that invest in Speed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double Kick can be used to break the Substitutes of Tyranitar and other threats, so it deserves a mention. Fire Blast can be replaced for Flamethrower, Overheat, or Blaze Kick: Flamethrower has reliable accuracy but less power. Overheat has both more accuracy and more power than Fire Blast, but gives Blaziken a nasty Special Attack drop afterwards. Nonetheless, Blaziken doesn't mind this much as it's switching in and out all the time anyway. While not as strong as the other attacks, Blaze Kick has a higher critical hit rate that can be helpful in some situations. Brick Break can be substituted for Sky Uppercut anywhere it's listed if you hate missing; they both do roughly the same amount of damage in the long run.</p> <p>A Salac Berry is always a good alternative to Leftovers, because Blaziken isn't going to be taking many hits anyway, and the main purpose of Leftovers is to counteract Sand Stream. Many hits from OU Pokemon, such as Zapdos's Thunderbolt and Suicune's Surf, will just barely leave Blaziken alive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gyarados and Salamence resist both of Blaziken's STAB moves, and have Intimidate to further weaken its physical attacks. To add insult to injury, they almost always carry STAB Hidden Power Flying, which is a guaranteed OHKO, and Blaziken can't even Endure the hit and sweep with Reversal, as they resist the move and inflict an Attack drop on Blaziken. However, they do need to beware of Thunder Punch and Hidden Power Ice, respectively, as this will OHKO them. Blaziken can also be faster than Gyarados, so it needs to be especially worried.</p> <p>Water-types such as Suicune, Slowbro, Starmie, Milotic, and Swampert all resist Fire, and thanks to either high Defense stats or handy resistances, take little damage from Blaziken's physical attacks. Even Thunder Punch variants don't do much to them. Swampert, however, has serious problems with Hidden Power Grass Blaziken, which nearly OHKOes. The Reversal set also threatens them, as a full-power Reversal does roughly 75% to Milotic and Swampert and OHKOes all of them save Slowbro after a Swords Dance.</p>",

        "Mixed Sweeper": {"description": "<p>Switch into Blissey or Skarmory, and predict Rock Slides or Focus Punches. Once Salamence or Suicune fall, seize the opportunity to Swords Dance and sweep with your chosen Fire STAB and Sky Uppercut. Blaziken is an excellent Fire-type mainly due to the fact that it actually has a physical STAB move.</p>"},
        "Special Attacker": {"description": "<p>The main dilemma on this set is between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass: the former covers Salamence and Flygon, while the latter nearly OHKOes Swampert. Blaziken must hit Salamence and Flygon on the switch, or on a predicted a Dragon Dance, but it can attack Swampert after it comes in, so Hidden Power Grass requires less prediction.</p> <p>The EVs enable Blaziken to always survive Zapdos's Thunderbolt and activate Blaze. For this reason, a Salac Berry isn't such a bad idea. Special Attack is given preference to Attack. As for Speed, maximum investment is an option to surprise Salamence that don't maximize Speed, and is especially handy if running Hidden Power Ice.</p>"},
        "Reversal": {
          "description": "<p>Blaziken has one major advantage over other users of Reversal: special STAB, which allows it to OHKO threats such as Weezing, Skarmory, and Gengar thanks to Blaze. Swords Dance is good if you can predict your opponent switching to a Pokemon such as Swampert; Blaziken can then Endure the super effective hit and OHKO with Reversal. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice nabs a surprise OHKO on Salamence that think they can Intimidate Blaziken and survive Reversal. Just be very careful using this, as Tyranitar runs rampant everywhere.</p> <p>Don't ever use Rock Slide on this set, as 1 HP Reversal is just as strong against Flying-types, and has no chance of missing. Focus Punch is an option if using Substitute in case your opponent tries to set up before Blaziken gets to 1 HP. Overheat has higher accuracy and more power than Fire Blast, but you can only use it once; conversely, though, Blaziken will normally only need to use it once. Flamethrower doesn't have the power to OHKO Weezing.</p> <p>This set must hit 264 Speed; in fact, 270 isn't such a bad idea. It beats out Adamant Heracross and makes Blaziken faster than all Pokemon bar Electrode and Ninjask after a Salac boost.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Believe it or not, Blaziken makes a surprisingly decent Choice Band user. If you are good at prediction, this set is just as good as the specially based Blaziken set, or maybe even a tad better. It is probably one of the best ways Blaziken can take down the bulky Water-types that tend to switch in on it. The EVs are straightforward: maximum Attack and Speed let Blaziken hit as hard and as fast as possible.</p>"},
        "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>Predict a switch, get a Substitute up, and have fun smiting the switch-in. Focus Punch does loads of damage, Hidden Power Ice takes care of Salamence, while Thunder Punch destroys Gyarados and weakened Water-types. Salac Berry is a nice option for when you get on low health; it might even fool opponents into believing Blaziken has Reversal. Again, Hidden Power Ice variants should go for maximum Speed to catch slower Salamence off-guard.</p>"}

  "Swampert": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>As the premier answer to some of the tier's most feared physical attackers and offense in general, Swampert is truly a leviathan of ADV OU. Defensively, Swampert's solid bulk and resistances to Rock and Steel allow it to answer Tyranitar, Metagross, and Aerodactyl; its access to Ice Beam allows it to counter physical Salamence and Flygon; and its immunity to Electric allows it to stop Electric-types like Zapdos and Jolteon that run Hidden Power Ice. Furthermore, Swampert's immunity to sand and access to Refresh and Roar give it both longevity and the ability to check setup sweepers on balanced and defensive teams, especially in conjunction with Protect to scout offensive Pokemon and gain passive healing from Leftovers. Swampert's defensive prominence is such that it has encouraged both Electric-types and mixed attackers to run Hidden Power Grass as a standard move for the sole purpose of beating it, a testament to its ubiquity and value. Offensively, Swampert's durability and solid Special Attack, as well as Torrent, give it the ability to fire off strong Hydro Pumps at defensive cores, and it can wield Earthquake and Focus Punch to dismantle Blissey, the tier's answer to special moves. Swampert can also run a Substitute + Endeavor set, whose potent Hydro Pump and immunity to sand make it a threatening wallbreaker or cleaner. On offensive sets, the characteristics that make Swampert's defense so stifling can be used to develop momentum and exploit mismatches and free turns with ease. Despite all this, Swampert struggles to break through the tier's other bulky Water-types, Milotic and Suicune, and it is walled cold by Celebi, which can outright use it as setup fodder. Furthermore, Spikes and attackers running Hidden Power Grass threaten to take huge chunks out of Swampert's HP, and its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers can make it difficult for it to last throughout a game.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse Swampert is a threatening sweeper with longevity through Rest, but the ubiquity of Ground-immune Pokemon and mixed attackers running Hidden Power Grass tends to hamper its sweeping prospects. An all-physical or even Choice Band Swampert would do better at pushing through defensive Water-types and could potentially lure in Celebi and KO it with Hidden Power Bug, but it would be required to drop Hydro Pump and thus require Magneton and Pursuit Tyranitar to avoid becoming bait for Skarmory and Gengar. In a similar vein, a Substitute + Focus Punch set similar to non-Salac Berry offensive Swampert could work, brutalizing Blissey and Snorlax much harder at the cost of requiring the same support an all-physical Swampert would and struggling even more against other Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass-types are the biggest threats to Swampert, as they hit it super effectively and target its only weakness. Celebi's natural defenses and access to Recover render Swampert almost deadweight, as it can come in repeatedly for free and create free turns, while Swampert can do little to dissuade it short of freezing it with Ice Beam. Venusaur, while lacking recovery, can still come in on Surfs and Hydro Pumps and threaten to land Sleep Powder on something. Opposing Water-types also give Swampert trouble, as they resist Hydro Pump, have the bulk to take Earthquakes, and can usually win the slugfests. Milotic and Rest Suicune are the primary examples of this, although Recover Starmie also deserves a mention. Cloyster, while not having recovery, can set Spikes against Swampert with impunity or threaten to use Explosion on it. Specially defensive Skarmory threatens to poison</p> <p>Skarmory with Toxic and lay down Spikes against it, cutting into its longevity, and with its heavy Special Defense investment, it can shrug off Swampert's Hydro Pumps. Heracross is an interesting example of a check, as it resists Earthquake and Focus Punch while having the natural bulk to switch into Hydro Pump once, and the sheer physical threat it poses can force Swampert to retreat rather than take a STAB Megahorn. However, Heracross lacks recovery and is worn down quickly by sand and Spikes, so it prefers to come in on pivots wherever possible. Gyarados's primary niche is its ability to handle defensive Water-types in a way that Tyranitar and Salamence cannot; it can potentially run Taunt to shut down Swampert's utility options and threatens to set up Dragon Dance while shrugging off resisted Surfs and weak Ice Beams. However, it has poor longevity and is more of an exploiter than a counter.</p> <p>In a different vein, Swampert's towering status over the metagame almost mandates the heavy use of Hidden Power Grass, and Swampert must always be wary of its specter. Gengar, Zapdos, and Salamence all threaten to land Hidden Power Grass while being able to switch in on predicted Earthquakes, and even a Tyranitar or Jolteon may reveal it to blow through a weakened Swampert. Furthermore, Swampert's heavy reliance on Protect for recovery and scouting can allow a skilled player room to create free switches and bring in offensive threats for free, so while none of these Pokemon are switch-ins, the threat they pose must be accounted for by the Swampert's player.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is Swampert's bread and butter, maximizing its ability to act as a team's defensive backbone against the tier's physical behemoths. Ice Beam and Earthquake are both attacks with a defensive purpose; Ice Beam covers Salamence and Flygon, as well as 2HKOing Aerodactyl, while Earthquake beats Tyranitar and Metagross. Protect is the primary ingredient to this set's longevity; while Swampert has only Rest for instant recovery, it is immune to sand and carries Leftovers, so it can use Protect to heal by constant increments for free and work around attempts to wear it down. Hydro Pump is an offensive move meant primarily to cover Skarmory and Gengar and deny them the ability to switch in for free. Hydro Pump also does higher damage than Earthquake or Ice Beam against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, OHKOing the latter with 36 Special Attack EVs and OHKOing both if Torrent is activated, which can mean avoiding a sweep in close games. However, a more defensive Swampert has other options to use: Roar keeps defensive setup sweepers like Suicune, Snorlax, and Jirachi from setting up for free and racks up Spikes damage against grounded Pokemon, while Refresh allows Swampert to shrug off poison and burn, keeping it from being worn down by status.</p> <p>The given spread maximizes Swampert's ability to take hits—248 HP EVs and 44 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Swampert survives Hidden Power Grass from Modest Zapdos from full, while the rest of the EVs go into Defense. As an alternative, 36 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Swampert's Hydro Pump will OHKO uninvested Aerodactyl. Running 96 Special Attack EVs with a Quiet nature threatens higher damage against Skarmory and Gengar, which certain teams may desire. Overall, Swampert's EVs can be reallocated in a variety of ways depending on priorities.</p> <p>This Swampert generally serves as the first line of defense against physical threats early-game, yet it requires an element of caution as well. Protect should be used early-game to scout for Hidden Power Grass from Tyranitar, Zapdos, or Salamence as well as a potential Explosion from Metagross, and a player should be willing to use pivots and double switches to protect Swampert from being hit by these. Damage rolls are important for identifying a Choice Band attacker. When given free turns, Hydro Pump is usually the best move to use, or Roar if dropping Hydro Pump. If lacking Refresh, be wary of taking Toxic from Skarmory or Zapdos so Swampert can check Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Choice Band Aerodactyl late-game. Protect gains value mid- and late-game for regaining health so a sustained physical assault doesn't wear your Swampert down, though you should be wary of overusing the move and giving up free turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert works well as a standalone wall, but it requires certain support to function at its best. In particular, Swampert wants switch-ins that can pressure Suicune, Milotic, and Celebi, all of which it struggles to touch, as well as a counter to Hidden Power Grass Electric-types and mixed attackers in general. Celebi and Flygon counter Hidden Power Grass Electric-types while appreciating Swampert's ability to deal with Hidden Power Ice Electric-types, while Blissey's ability to stonewall special attackers complements Swampert beautifully. Faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Starmie, and Jolteon can be used as one-time switch-ins against mixed attackers to force them out and make Swampert's life easier. Zapdos can check both Metagross and mixed Salamence while heavily pressuring Skarmory and defensive Water-types, which Swampert appreciates immensely. In a similar vein, Moltres's ability to cover Swampert against Metagross and destroy Celebi is extremely valuable.</p> <p>Due to its lack of immediate offense, Swampert appreciates Spikes and sand support to punish more defensive teams that it can be deadweight versus. Both Skarmory and Tyranitar cover Snorlax, a major physical threat that Swampert doesn't beat on its own, and can back it up against physical threats in general. In addition, Swampert lacking Hydro Pump struggles against Skarmory, Forretress, and Gengar, so it appreciates Magneton and Pursuit Tyranitar's support, and even with Hydro Pump it tends to appreciate Skarmory and Gengar's removal from the game. Lastly, Salamence and Metagross make phenomenal partners for Swampert; Salamence can weaken physical attackers with Intimidate and tempt the opponent to use Rock Slide so Swampert can easily switch in, while Metagross serves as a backup Rock-type answer and check to physical attackers. Both Pokemon also provide the instant offense that this Swampert lacks, which helps to round out a team.</p>"
        },
        "Surf Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set constitutes a variant on the above defensive set that sacrifices self-sufficiency for certain utilities and a more intuitive playstyle.  STAB Surf allows Swampert to cover the metagame in a similar way that Hydro Pump does, allowing it to guarantee neutral damage on switch-ins like Skarmory and Gengar. Toxic complements Surf, targeting Water-resistant Pokemon like Celebi, Suicune, and Salamence and passive Pokemon like Blissey, keeping them from staying in with impunity. Protect can be used to rack up Toxic damage against aggressive attackers like Salamence and stay healthy in slugfests against Blissey, as well as letting Swampert heal up through Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Refresh completes this set utility-wise, making it impossible to wear down via status. Roar usually fits better on teams that need a phazer, as denying free setup to Dragon Dance Salamence and defensive Calm Mind Jirachi can be quite important considering that this set forgoes Earthquake and Ice Beam. The choice between these moves comes down to team-based necessity. The given EVs maximize Defense while letting Swampert outspeed uninvested Tyranitar and Quiet Metagross and guaranteeing survival against Hidden Power Grass from Modest Zapdos. Note that forgoing Earthquake allows Swampert to run a Bold nature to outrun standard defensive Swampert.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forgoing Earthquake and Ice Beam means that Choice Band Metagross and Dragon Dance Salamence pose great threats to this particular Swampert set, as its lack of a super effective attack grants them more turns to attack and more chances to potentially break through. Skarmory's support helps cover both of these Pokemon, while setting Spikes to help compensate for Swampert's lack of instant offense and punish grounded Pokemon like Milotic, Suicune, Celebi, and Snorlax that would otherwise switch in for comparatively free. Tyranitar's sand also inconveniences these Pokemon, and it can cover Swampert's back against Pokemon like Gengar, Jirachi, Snorlax, and physical Salamence. As Surf does less damage to Skarmory than Hydro Pump does, Magneton support is much appreciated with this Swampert to prevent Skarmory from freely laying Spikes down. It also helps that Magneton brutalizes Milotic while removing weakened Metagross, both of which this Swampert struggles against. Lastly, a consistent switch-in to Celebi, such as Salamence, Moltres, or Aerodactyl, generally partners well with this Swampert. Moltres in particular can destroy Skarmory and check Metagross, both of which this Swampert appreciates</p>"
        },
        "Standard Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>As a contrast to the above sets, this is an offensive Swampert set that relies on its mixed attacking power to break common defensive archetypes and punish some of its standard checks. Hydro Pump threatens to 2HKO or 3HKO virtually any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Focus Punch works to get a guaranteed hit on predicted switches and, more importantly, prevents Blissey from freely recovering with Soft-Boiled, which keeps it from being a reliable check. Ice Beam primarily nails specially defensive Zapdos as well as Salamence and Grass-types. Earthquake gives Swampert mixed attacking coverage, which helps wear down Blissey, pressures specially defensive Jirachi, and guarantees the KO on Tyranitar and Metagross at certain ranges rather than risking a Hydro Pump miss.  However, as all these Pokemon are covered to some extent by Hydro Pump and Focus Punch, Hidden Power Grass can be used in the fourth slot on more offensive teams, where luring in and removing opposing Swampert and clobbering Cloyster might be higher priorities.</p> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Rash nature maximize Swampert's damage output, while the Speed investment allows it to outrun Adamant Claydol as well as Blissey, specially defensive Skarmory, and slower variants of Metagross and Tyranitar. The rest of the EVs go into Defense as opposed to HP to maximize Swampert's ability to take physical hits, which this spread takes noticeably worse than usual. 28 Attack EVs ensure that a Focus Punch followed by an Earthquake from Swampert will always KO Blissey from full with sand up, thereby ensuring that using Focus Punch against Blissey on the switch will pay off. Bulkier spreads are of course possible, as is maximizing Speed for the purpose of outrunning Jolly Marowak and negative-natured Wish + Protect Jirachi.</p> <p>This set is meant to be played aggressively, relying on Swampert's natural ability to force switches and Hydro Pump's damage output for offensive momentum. It's generally better to bring this Swampert in on predicted switches and resisted moves like Rock Slide than to take massive damage from Choice Band Metagross or mixed Tyranitar. The player should be willing to trade Swampert's health for potential KOs or preserve it so it can hold off an expected Dragon Dance Tyranitar or Aerodactyl in the back. Prediction is key when using this Swampert. Keep in mind that despite the offensive spread, this Swampert cannot break through Milotic, Rest Suicune, or Celebi without significant luck, and thus it should always avoid those matchups. As always, be wary of Hidden Power Grass, as the lack of HP investment leaves Swampert vulnerable to being outright KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metagross is absolutely integral as a partner, as this Swampert cannot be relied on defensively and thus requires the support of a backup Rock-type check and check to physical attackers. Metagross and Swampert together form a dual status pivot core against Blissey; Metagross is immune to Toxic, and Swampert is immune to Thunder Wave. Thus, they exert massive pressure on it for an offensive team while playing around potential status attempts. Metagross tends to appreciate Swampert's targeting of Skarmory and opposing Swampert while threatening to use Explosion on Milotic and Suicune and thereby open up Swampert as a threat. Salamence draws Rock Slides that give Swampert an opportunity to switch in, and its Intimidate cushions physical blows for Swampert to come in on, while it appreciates the offense this set brings. Salamence pairs extremely well with both Metagross and Jirachi as well, providing offense and an immunity to Earthquake. Offensive Celebi and Zapdos threaten to blow through Milotic, Rest Suicune, and Recover Starmie, all of which this Swampert struggles to touch.  Furthermore, they can potentially Baton Pass Calm Mind or Agility boosts to Swampert, making it much more of an offensive threat. Hidden Power Grass Swampert particularly appreciates these boosts, as at +1 or +2, it can push through Milotic and Suicune on its own.</p> <p>As always, Spikes are helpful to punish Grass-types and bulky Water-types, which tend to switch into Hydro Pump with impunity. Skarmory and Cloyster can also back Swampert up against physical attackers that threaten it. Lastly, faster Pokemon like Starmie and Jolteon appreciate this Swampert's wallbreaking capabilities while threatening mixed attackers like Salamence that can give it trouble.</p>"
        },
        "Substitute + Salac Berry": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute + Salac Berry Swampert is, if anything, an even more all-in approach to offensive Swampert. This set relies on many of Swampert's useful characteristics: Torrent, an immunity to sand, and access to Endeavor, which make it a frightening sweeper.</p> <p>Substitute lets Swampert reduce its HP to active Torrent and its Berry, while Endeavor capitalizes on that loss of HP to beat defensive Pokemon. Hydro Pump is the usual Water-type STAB attack, which does frightening damage when boosted by Torrent, but Surf's accuracy is appreciated on certain teams, particularly with Magneton support to nullify Skarmory. Roar constitutes a surprisingly innovative option for a fourth move, capitalizing on Endeavor. As many potential answers to this set—Milotic, Celebi, and Blissey,—have instant recovery moves and can thus stall out Endeavor, Roar's negative priority guarantees them to be forced out and puts your opponent into an uncomfortable situation. If they switch back to their counter as you use Endeavor, they've lost their counter; if they leave whatever Roar forced in to take a Hydro Pump, they're a Pokemon down. In addition, Roar provides defensive utility in denying Calm Mind users such as Suicune, Celebi, and Jirachi, which tend to threaten the teams this Swampert usually finds itself on.</p> <p>Ice Beam is an option to cover Celebi and drops Salamence, the latter of which might be important for a team to cover, but the fact that both of Ice Beam's targets are affected by sand and technically covered by Endeavor is another mark in favor of Roar's viability. Swagger constitutes an additional option, as the confusion chance forces a similar coinflip for the opponent, but unlike Roar it has no utility and can potentially backfire.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly straightforward: maximum Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature. Note that even after the Salac Berry boost, Swampert is outrun by Starmie, Jolly Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Jolteon. This Swampert is fairly intuitive as far as play goes—use Substitute when given free turns, use Hydro Pump against passive Pokemon or phazers, and start using Endeavor once Salac Berry activates. Generally, one should try to bring this set in on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence, as their hits will force Swampert into Salac Berry range quicker and reverse an attacker's momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Swampert is completely unreliable defensively and must be paired with other offensive checks to physical attackers so its team won't be overwhelmed. Metagross's support is virtually obligatory to check Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, as well as Dragon Dance Salamence should this set not run Ice Beam. In addition, Metagross's Choice Band-boosted Earthquake utterly destroys Thunderbolt + Ice Punch Jirachi, which this Swampert cannot check without Roar and cannot beat outright. Magneton's support is surprisingly helpful, as it offers an additional Rock-type resistance while trapping Skarmory, whose Spikes and Whirlwind can interfere with Swampert's attempts to sweep, and allows Swampert to use the more accurate Surf with fewer risks.</p> <p>This Swampert tends to target defensive cores and thereby open them up for offensive Pokemon; Zapdos and Suicune appreciate Swampert removing Celebi and Blissey, while Metagross and Dragon Dance Salamence appreciate the removal of opposing Suicune and Milotic as well as Skarmory being weakened. Offensive Suicune is an interesting partner for this Swampert set, as it can also serve as a one-off check to physical threats and backs up Swampert while exerting massive pressure on Pokemon such as Skarmory and Snorlax.  These two form a double Water-type core that can ground a team offensively and defensively. Lastly, sand is a helpful complement to Swampert's offense to finish off defensive Pokemon weakened by Endeavor. Dragon Dance Tyranitar also tends to appreciate this Swampert's ability to break defensive cores and open up sweeping opportunities. As an alternate option, however, Pursuit Tyranitar can remove Gengar, which can be quite the annoyance to Swampert with its immunity to Endeavor, and it can run Ice Beam to cover Roar variants against Dragon Dance Salamence.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gardevoir's movepool is humungous, to say the least, and it is very versatile: you can vary its moveset to fit your team, mixing and matching moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Hypnosis, and Wish as you find appropriate. Fire Punch is good for Grass- and Steel-types, such as Celebi and Metagross, respectively. As with its fellow Psychic-types, Gardevoir can make use of Hidden Power Grass to hurt Tyranitar and Claydol, and of course to OHKO Swampert. Psych Up lets it steal boosts from the likes of Suicune, Celebi, and Jirachi, and then proceed to beat them up: Suicune will fall to Thunderbolt, Jirachi to Fire Punch, and Celebi to either Fire Punch or Ice Punch. The paralysis provided by Thunder Wave is always appreciated, as are the defensive boosts from Light Screen and Reflect. Gardevoir can also sacrifice itself with Memento to set up a sweep for a Belly Drum or Focus Punch user, but beware of Metagross's Clear Body. Snatch is another way of wrecking opposing Calm Mind users.</p> <p>It should be noted that while Trace is a fun ability and the more useful one as well, Synchronize can be neat as it lets Gardevoir switch into Will-O-Wisp from Dusclops or Weezing and burn them in return. Gardevoir detests being burned, though, so be sure to pack cleric support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey sponges any special attack, but she cannot beat Gardevoir on her own if Gardevoir has Wish or Rest, and Gardevoir might trap her with Mean Look. Snorlax hates being hit by Will-O-Wisp, but it can Curse up and Rest it off if it so desires, and pounds Gardevoir on its low Defense. Calm Mind-boosted Psychic will hurt Snorlax though, so be careful. Metagross resists Psychic and Ice Punch and can Meteor Mash Gardevoir into oblivion; just avoid Will-O-Wisp and Fire Punch. Tyranitar is immune to Psychic and can dent Gardevoir with STAB Rock Slide or Crunch, but again, beware of Will-O-Wisp. Celebi and Jirachi both resist Psychic and can engage Gardevoir in a Psychic war; if Gardevoir isn't packing Calm Mind, they will likely pose problems. Claydol can attack Gardevoir with Earthquake, but if Gardevoir switches in, it will Trace Levitate. Psych Up Regice can go toe-to-toe with Calm Mind variants, but it might need a critical hit or a freeze to emerge victorious. Without Calm Mind, Gardevoir isn't getting past Regice anytime soon, though.</p> <p>Generally, Gardevoir cannot stand up to strong physical hits. While they cannot effectively switch into Gardevoir's powerful special attacks, Tauros, Aerodactyl, Dodrio, and Salamence are all faster and can put the hurt on Gardevoir. Heracross works as well; while it has the advantage of being able to absorb Will-O-Wisp, it must be wary of Psychic. Also, note that Timid Gardevoir is faster than Adamant Heracross. Choice Band Swellow too will easily OHKO Gardevoir with a Guts-boosted Return, Double-Edge, or Facade.</p>",

Thanks to Trace, Gardevoir can switch in easily against Levitate Pokemon using Earthquake, Flygon and Claydol for instance, as well as Pokemon with an absorption ability, such as Jolteon and Vaporeon. Once it's on the field, proceed to boost up with Calm Mind and smite opponents with powerful attacks off that mighty Special Attack stat. If Snorlax is ruining your fun, Will-O-Wisp will teach it a lesson; alternatively, Gardevoir can also use Destiny Bond to take a foe down along with it. A Salac Berry isn't a bad idea here, but note that it might give away the surprise. Note that the options in the last two moveslots can all be used interchangeably, and with just about any alternative in the Other Options section as well.</p> <p>Offensive variants of Gardevoir, like this one, should mostly invest in Speed and Special Attack. Good Speed stats to hit are 244 (192 EVs with a neutral Speed nature), which beats all Tyranitar, and 270 (200 EVs and a positive nature), which outpaces Adamant Heracross.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Mawile is pretty unassuming at first glance, with no stellar stats to speak of; however, as its Pokedex entries state, looks can be deceiving. Mawile is actually one of the best Pokemon in NU with a lot of positive qualities to speak of, which include: a defensively fantastic pure Steel typing, a great ability in Intimidate to bolster its otherwise below-average Defense, and most importantly, access to Baton Pass and a phenomenal movepool. Thanks to these qualities, Mawile can take on several roles for teams and do them all extremely well. Most commonly, Mawile's roles are to check Normal- and Flying-types, help the team through softening physical blows with Intimidate, and support its offensive teammates by passing Swords Dance and/or Substitute to them. Common weaknesses, particularly the ubiquitous Fighting-type weakness that plagues nearly every physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, and low Special Defense and Speed stats are Mawile's downfalls. Despite this, Mawile is a fantastic choice for offensive and defensive teams alike, and most teams are only made better with its addition.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set is doable considering Mawile's plethora of resistances; although, its special bulk is pretty abysmal on the whole, it does at least avoid the 2HKO from Plusle's Thunderbolt at max Special Defense investment, making a RestTalk set a viable option. Speaking of, a physical RestTalk set is more than doable, but one of Mawile's major draws is its flexibility in battle thanks to Baton Pass, and a RestTalk set actively works against that. A special attacking set is a cute gimmick when paired with Fake Tears, and Mawile actually has a decent special movepool that includes Fire Blast, Crunch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Hidden Power Grass. Finally, a Substitute + Torment set could really screw over a lot of Pokemon, as most in the tier will typically only be carrying one move that threatens Mawile; however, Mawile's Speed makes this set somewhat ineffective on the whole.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>RestTalk bulky Water-types are the best immediate answers to Mawile, as they resist Steel, don't care too much about Toxic, and can hit Mawile on its lower Special Defense stat with their STAB moves. Wailord in particular is probably the best overall answer to Mawile, as it can use Roar to disrupt Mawile's Baton Passing shenanigans. Dewgong can also disrupt Baton Pass through Encore and Perish Song. Otherwise, Whiscash and Relicanth can easily 2HKO Mawile with Earthquake and shrug off Mawile's other attacks easily enough. After Water-types, Hitmonchan has a tougher time switching directly into Mawile due to its physical frailty, but once in it'll easily OHKO Mawile. Fire-types like Flareon make great switch-ins to Mawile, as they resist Steel and can easily OHKO Mawile with their Fire STAB moves, with Flareon also being able to carry Roar to disrupt Baton Pass. Tangela is physically bulky enough to not be fazed by anything Mawile can through at it apart from a rare boosted Sludge Bomb, and it can proceed to either put Mawile to sleep or blast it with Hidden Power Fire under the sun.</p> <p>For the most part, fully countering Mawile is difficult due to its affinity to Baton Pass out. Doing things to disrupt the momentum and making smart switches are going to do more to bring Mawile down than trying to counter it directly. Pokemon with phazing moves are the most effective answers to Mawile outside of the ones listed above, Whirlwind Tropius being an excellent answer in particular, but Roar Lairon and Piloswine making decent answers as well. Other disrupting moves like Encore, Perish Song, Leech Seed, and status moves like Thunder Wave will go a long way in taking it and its teammates down.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Substitute + Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<p>One of Mawile's biggest draws is its access to Baton Pass, which lets it both support its team and keep momentum. Substitute is the most flexible move to pair with Baton Pass, as it allows Mawile to protect itself from whatever Pokemon is switching in, giving it a clean exit to Baton Pass out to a teammate and scout your opponent's team and movesets. Mawile makes an exceptional switch-in to Choice-locked Rock-, Normal-, and Flying-type attacks, an invaluable asset for any team, and doing so lets it get a free Substitute up or simply keep momentum by dry passing on the predicted switch.</p> <p>Once freely behind a Substitute, Mawile can do a couple different things apart from simply passing it to a teammate. Mawile is one of the few Pokemon with access to both Swords Dance and Baton Pass in NU, which is an incredible tool for offensive teams. At +2, dangerous physical attackers like Hitmonchan and Pidgeot become absolute wrecking balls with little to stand in their way. If you're able to pass both Substitute and Swords Dance to a teammate, there's little that can stand in the way of a victory. Alternatively, Focus Punch is a fantastic option that pairs perfectly with Substitute, allowing Mawile to dish out decently powerful hits on the Pokemon likely to switch in on it.</p> <p>Hidden Power Steel is a required STAB move to give Mawile a decent hit on a good portion of the metagame and makes sure it isn't a sitting duck should it be unable to get up a Substitute or Baton Pass out to a teammate. With a Swords Dance under its belt, Mawile is actually pretty threateningly strong, allowing it to attempt a sweep itself should the need be there, although this shouldn't be a main end-game goal considering Steel's poor coverage and Mawile's lackluster stats.</p> <p>The EV spread is highly flexible and the one given is a balanced spread to allow Mawile to do a couple different things. With 124 Speed EVs, Mawile is able to outspeed minimum base 60s, particularly Whiscash and Wailord. 132 HP EVs let Mawile set up a Substitute on -1 Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and keep the Substitute intact as it passes to a teammate. This lets Mawile invest the rest of its EVs in Attack to boost the strength of Hidden Power Steel and Focus Punch. If you have no desire to use Mawile for attacking and instead want to focus on its defensive qualities, an Impish nature with max HP and 132 EVs in Defense can be run to allow Mawile to set up on even more attacks, with its Substitute notably surviving even -1 Choice Band Raticate's Double-Edge. No Speed and a Relaxed nature can be run as well to allow Mawile to underspeed as much as possible, forcing it to eat the hit of the opposing Pokemon before passing to a teammate, giving its teammate clear entry onto the battlefield. With max Defense investment, Mawile's Substitute will survive even -1 Choice Band Pidgeot's Double-Edge. Finally, no attacking moves can be run on this set, allowing Mawile to run both Swords Dance and Iron Defense on the same set, which is most commonly seen on Baton Pass chains.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, particularly Wailord and Whiscash, are the best switch-ins to Mawile, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Substitute and Swords Dance and force them out are the best possible teammates, with examples including Kecleon and Hitmonchan. Ground- and Fighting-types are also common switch-ins to Mawile, making Flying-types like Pidgeot and Poison-types like Swalot good teammates too. Pelipper creates a very good defensive core with Mawile, as it resists Fighting and Fire and is immune to Ground. Kecleon and Lickitung are good specially defensive Pokemon to pair with Mawile as well, since its Special Defense is abysmal and you'll need switch-ins to the special attacks aimed its way.</p> <p>Finally, Mawile is an essential part of Baton Pass chains, and this set is essentially the one you would use should you put it on a chain. If doing so, it's recommended to replace Hidden Power Steel with Iron Defense, as Mawile is one of the few with access to it and Baton Pass. Max HP and max Speed should be used as well.</p>"
        },
        "Physically Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Thanks to Intimidate and its Steel typing, Mawile is actually a fairly stout physically defensive bulwark against the myriad of Choice Band users and physical attackers in the tier, despite its average stats. This set aims to make the most of this fact, becoming an amazing defensive pivot for defensive and offensive teams alike. Even with no Attack investment, Hidden Power Steel is a good STAB move that makes use of Mawile's decent base 85 Attack and makes sure it isn't a complete sitting duck. That said, Seismic Toss provides much more consistent damage at the cost of being unable to touch Haunter. Toxic is needed as a semi-consistent damage source and heavily cripples the Choice Band attackers that Mawile so effectively checks. Protect helps scout the opponent's attacks and stalls for Leftovers recovery and Toxic damage. Baton Pass should be on the set, regardless if Mawile actually has something to pass or not, as it provides amazing momentum and scouts your opponent's switches.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are flexible, although max defensive investment is recommended to allow Mawile to check and counter as many Pokemon as possible. A bit more Attack can be used to beef up Hidden Power Steel a bit, or a bit more Speed can be run with Substitute over Protect to allow Mawile to, for example, set up a Substitute before getting hit by Sleep Powder or Leech Seed from defensive Bellossom and then Baton Passing to a teammate. Body Slam can be run somewhere to let Mawile spread paralysis a bit on the opponent's team, preferably over Toxic so the two statuses don't clash too much. Taunt is an interesting option to let Mawile outstall certain defensive Pokemon like Kecleon and Relicanth that would normally be able to shrug off Toxic with Rest; however, it's hard to use, as it only lasts two turns and Mawile sports no recovery of its own outside of Leftovers. Counter is a good option as well, since Mawile can tank almost any physical attack thrown its way at full health, even most super effective ones if the foe is at -1 Attack, and take out the opponent in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Spikes paired with this set make it very dangerous, as almost all of Mawile's checks are grounded, which means Glalie and Roselia are good teammates. As this set fits well on defensive and stall teams, dedicated special walls like Lickitung make excellent teammates to cover Mawile's lower Special Defense and forming a solid defensive core. Chimecho and Pelipper in particular pair well with Mawile as they cover its Fighting and Ground weaknesses, with Pelipper also covering the Fire weakness. In return, Mawile checks the Choice Band attackers they cannot handle, like Pidgeot. Mawile also fits well on more offensive teams as a pivot to check dangerous attackers like Raticate and dry passing to teammates to keep momentum.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>This set is a bit unexpected and allows Mawile to hit very hard right off the bat, which can surprise the opponent and force more switches. Hidden Power Steel is a decent STAB move and is a nice safety move to use on this set. Focus Punch hits very hard, in fact—it hits way harder than Hidden Power Steel on almost every target—but is a bit hard to use without Substitute, and Brick Break is an all-around safer and more reliable option to use. That said, Focus Punch can OHKO Dewgong where Brick Break tops out at about 65%, so if you can predict well the power is more than worth it. Rock Slide rounds off coverage nicely and hits the Fire-types likely to switch into Mawile very hard. However, Sludge Bomb is an option as well and hits neutral targets and Tangela far harder than Rock Slide.</p> <p>Baton Pass is what makes this set viable and dangerous. With it, Mawile can retain momentum for its team and feign a defensive or supportive set early in the game while scouting the opponent's team. This gives Mawile a huge leg up when compared to similar Choice Band users like Lairon, and because of Mawile's tendency to switch often, it creates opportunities to surprise your opponent with a powerful Focus Punch.</p> <p>124 Speed EVs are run to let Mawile outspeed minimum base 60s, particularly Wailord, max Attack is run to give it as much power possible, and the rest is pumped into HP to increase its overall bulk. More Speed can easily be run to outrun key threats like Dewgong, but one of Mawile's perks is its decent bulk combined with Intimidate, and having a Choice Band user that isn't threatened by a large majority of physical attackers is one of the major reasons to include it on your team. A move not mentioned above that is perfectly usable is Double-Edge―a powerful safety move that can be included in the third or fourth slot—but it offers no additional super effective coverage and the recoil is undesirable.</p> <p>Mawile tends to lure in defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and Flareon with its other sets, and this set can surprise them and take them out quickly with Focus Punch and Rock Slide, respectively. Lacking Earthquake and a powerful STAB move is ultimately Mawile's downside as a Choice Band user, but when combined with one or two more heavy hitters like Hitmonchan and Murkrow, Mawile can really put the pressure on defensive and offensive teams alike, making it a decent choice for offensive teams. Pelipper creates a very good defensive backup for Mawile, as it resists Fighting and Fire and is immune to Ground. Kecleon and Lickitung are good specially defensive Pokemon to pair with Mawile as well, since its Special Defense is particularly abysmal, with Kecleon being able to pull off a similar Choice Band or physical attacking set itself to continue pressuring the opponent.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>A pretty unassuming specimen at first glance, Plusle is actually one of the most threatening Pokemon in the NU tier, largely due to the fact that it's one of only three usable Electric-types available and the best one of the bunch. Directly outclassing Minun offensively and packing more Speed than Pikachu makes Plusle the dominant Electric-type. While it has little in the way of offensive coverage apart from its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ice and Grass, it doesn't really need the coverage to blast apart the opposition. It sits atop its throne as one of the best revenge killers and late-game sweepers available, a much-needed check to the Flying-types and sweepers like Huntail, and basically the cutest threat there is.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Plusle has a few tricks up its sleeve, but they're all pretty much done better by Minun. That said, Toxic and Thunder Wave are available to cripple common switch-ins, particularly the Grass-types not named Roselia and specially bulky Pokemon like Kecleon. Agility + Baton Pass can make a teammate especially threatening, but Plusle itself doesn't need the extra Speed in most cases, apart from getting to outspeed Raticate as well as Huntail in the rain. Light Screen and Wish are also both options to help out the team, but again, they are better left to Minun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kecleon with Rest and Lickitung with Wish are probably the best overall switch-ins to Plusle, as they aren't even 4HKOed by Thunderbolt and only really dislike Encore or Toxic. Grass-types, particularly specially defensive Bellossom and Roselia, don't fear much from Plusle either, as 252 / 252+ Bellossom isn't even 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice. Specially defensive Flareon isn't even 3HKOed by Thunderbolt either and has Wish to heal itself back up. Other specially defensive options include Swalot and Sableye, although the latter should be wary of switching in despite having Recover, as it is easily 3HKOed.</p> <p>Shelgon can use Plusle as setup bait if Plusle is using Hidden Power Grass over Hidden Power Ice. Other offensive checks to Plusle include Hitmonchan and bulky Ground-types like Piloswine and Whiscash, the latter assuming Plusle lacks Hidden Power Grass. Diglett can trap and KO Plusle if the latter is running anything other than max Speed, but otherwise, it only Speed ties and Plusle can either escape with Baton Pass or go for the KO with Hidden Power. Apart from that, anything with Earthquake that can tank at least one Thunderbolt will easily annihilate Plusle, which includes Pokemon like Arbok, Metang, and Vigoroth.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>The choice between which Hidden Power to pair with Plusle's STAB Thunderbolt is a tough one; Hidden Power Ice gets extremely important coverage against Grass-types, but Hidden Power Grass gets a far stronger hit on many of the dangerous Ground-types of the tier, namely Whiscash, Piloswine, and Graveler. It all comes down to the team Plusle is on and what threats are most dangerous that it needs to cover. In the end, though, the common Grass-types will likely be able to tank Hidden Power Ice, but in end-game scenarios, they should be sufficiently weakened enough to be KOed by it.</p> <p>Substitute takes advantage of the switches Plusle is likely to create, blocks status, and is a good way to Baton Pass into a teammate safely. However, Encore is a fantastic disrupting move if you predict a non-damaging move from the foe that can create opportunities for Plusle's teammates to switch in for free or force the foe to take more damage from Thunderbolt. The last moveslot needs to go to Baton Pass to allow Plusle to scout the opponent's switches and retain momentum in Plusle's favor throughout the match.</p> <p>Max Speed and a Timid nature are absolutely needed in order to Speed tie with other Plusle and Haunter and be able to outspeed Pidgeot and Murkrow. Running anything else is not at all recommended due to the importance of Plusle's Speed tier. Magnet is an option to boost the power of Plusle's STAB move a bit, in particular opening up a 2HKO on physically defensive Chimecho. Petaya Berry is another alternative item option with a boost that can be Baton Passed to a teammate as well. At +1, Plusle can easily 2HKO Roselia with Hidden Power Ice and OHKO even specially defensive Wailord with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Fake Tears can be used to push a lot of switch-ins into the OHKO or 2HKO range, particularly Lickitung, which is easily 2HKOed by Thunderbolt after a Fake Tears, and Choice Band Hitmonchan, which is OHKOed after Fake Tears and a layer of Spikes. However, using Fake Tears requires a lot of prediction and is generally less safe to use than Substitute or Encore. Rain Dance can be used with Thunder as the STAB move, and this combination is great when used in tandem with Huntail as a sweeping partner. Apart from those two options, most other support moves are done better by Minun, which is slightly bulkier.</p> <p>In general, most specially bulky Pokemon can check Plusle, particularly Grass-types and other Pokemon that aren't weak to Thunderbolt like Swalot and Kecleon. Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like Flareon make good teammates in order to blast through the Grass-types, and Flareon can easily countersweep Sunny Day Bellossom. Hitmonchan makes for a good teammate that can smash apart Kecleon and Lickitung. Piloswine and other Ground-types like Graveler are good teammates to take on the likes of Swalot, and they love Plusle's ability to remove Water- and Flying-types from the picture.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>There's little reason to use Minun when Plusle and Pikachu are in the tier. Offensively, Minun is outclassed by both; however, in a support role, Minun is usually the better choice. Fortunately for Minun, its support movepool is pretty expansive, and while it's outclassed by Plusle offensively, it's still offensively threatening in its own right. The real question to consider is: why choose Minun over other support Pokemon in the tier, particularly much more defensive options like Kecleon and Swalot? The answer should be its incredible base 95 Speed and the fact it has Electric-type STAB moves to revenge kill the likes of very dangerous Pokemon like Pidgeot and Murkrow. Either that or because it's significantly cuter than the other options.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The main thing to consider when using Minun is: would Plusle be better here? In nearly every situation, Plusle will be the better choice. However, one thing not mentioned above to consider is using Minun and Plusle on the same team. A one-two punch core of two very fast Electric-types could very easily overwhelm the opponent, who's probably expecting one Electric-type at most. This could cause them to lose their special wall like Kecleon early, opening an opportunity for the second mouse to come in and finish the job.</p> <p>There really aren't any other options to consider beyond that for Minun because anything else is done better by Plusle or Pikachu. A Rain Dance + Thunder + Hidden Power Water set is possible, and Minun's higher bulk may allow it to set up Rain Dance where Plusle could not, but that's unlikely and Plusle would just hit harder than Minun. Finally, Endure + Petaya Berry + Baton Pass is another option, but again, because it relies on Endure to work anyway, Plusle would ultimately be a better choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because Minun is primarily a support Pokemon, outright countering it is difficult. However, as an Electric-type, it is still fairly threatening to more offensive teams. Therefore, the best general move when faced with a Minun is to switch in a Ground-type like Graveler. Very rarely Minun will be running Hidden Power Grass, but just play carefully and try to suss out if the opponent might be using Minun as a lure. The next best switch-ins to Minun are Grass-types, which only fear the extremely rare Hidden Power Ice. Roselia in particular is a fantastic switch-in to any Minun. Special walls like Lickitung, Kecleon, and Swalot are also great choices to switch into Minun, but just be wary of getting blocked by Substitute or getting locked into a non-damaging move by Encore. Finally, really anything with Earthquake that can tank a Thunderbolt will ultimately defeat it. The main thing to keep in mind is what Minun is doing for its teammates, which is most likely passing Wishes.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Support": {
          "description": "<p>This set fully separates Minun from Plusle and Pikachu by accenting its increased bulk and ability to make use of its very large array of support moves. Wish is the most prized move, increasing the team's longevity throughout the match. The next three moveslots can be mixed and matched to your liking, and there's a lot of ways that you can play with Minun depending on your team and playstyle. Encore opens up a lot of setup opportunities, and Minun possesses the fastest Encore in the tier, allowing it to lock fast setup threats like Vigoroth into Bulk Up if Minun switches in as they set up. Substitute is cool when passed with Baton Pass, and it can also be used with both Encore and Baton Pass to ensure the Substitute gets to Minun's teammate. Baton Pass is also a great tool to get Minun out to a teammate it wants to pass Wish to.</p> <p>Light Screen is a neat option, as Minun threatens some of the most threatening special sweepers in the tier, particularly Huntail. Minun also tends to lure in Grass-types like Bellossom and Roselia, and Light Screen allows for an easier switch in for a teammate. Thunderbolt is used for a STAB move, and even without any Special Attack investment, it easily clips the wings of Murkrow and Pidgeot and is just in general a great move in the tier.</p> <p>A more offensive EV spread is usable, but if you want to take that route, you're better off using Plusle instead. Thunderbolt and Wish can also be replaced by any of the moves listed in the set above, depending on how Minun best fits on your team. Another move option is Protect, which allows Minun to easily heal from its own Wish and can build up Toxic damage on the foe. Rain Dance is usable as well to allow for a Huntail teammate sweep, and Encore and Baton Pass create a lot of good setup opportunities. Thunder Wave is an option to spread status, and Minun's Speed allows it to cripple a few threatening sweepers that other slow support Pokemon may fail against, such as Vigoroth, Arbok, and Hitmonchan.</p> <p>Offensively, Hidden Power Grass can be fit on the set, as Minun tends to lure in Ground-types like Whiscash and Graveler. Agility + Baton Pass is another good strategy to consider with this set; Choice Band Relicanth is an example of a great teammate that becomes significantly more threatening with +2 Speed under its belt, and Relicanth is relatively easy to switch into battle thanks to its high bulk.</p> <p>Assuming Minun isn't running Hidden Power Grass, Ground-types fear nothing from this set apart from getting locked into a non-damaging move from Encore. This means a teammate that can tank Earthquake is needed. Chimecho, Flying-types, and Grass-types are all good teammates for this reason, and they all appreciate the Wish support and easier switch in opportunities Minun provides. Lickitung and Kecleon also fear nothing Minun can throw at them apart from the rare Toxic, meaning strong physical sweepers like Hitmonchan and Kingler are needed to break past them.</p>"

The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Kecleon is cool and actually somewhat usable in OU play, with easy switch-ins on a lot of special Pokemon and the ability to screw your opponent up with moves like Trick. In UU, it can wall a ton of special hits, and can attack moderately hard with that base 90 Attack.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Skill Swap is a nice twist, you'll probably want to use it with Shadow Ball. Kecleon doesn't really work as a special attacker overall, but you could probably nail Gyarados and Salamence. Magic Coat is a really cool move, but it's usually more reliable to just use Thunder Wave. Toxic can force things like Suicune to Rest, or Psych Up to steal Calm Minds. It can use Substitute + Focus Punch, as it has the horrible Speed to do it.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Always max Kecleon's dismal HP, it will really help it take special hits. You generally don't want to bother with Defense, so just focus on Attack and Special Defense. If you are using Substitute + Focus Punch, give Kecleon a -Speed nature to ensure you go last on the turn you Substitute, so you can Focus Punch next turn uninterrupted.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey, Suicune, etc. Anything that can abuse its ability, has high Attack, or has high HP. You can mess up most of the counters with Trick though, which just makes Kecleon even cooler.</p>",
      "sets": {"Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Kecleon has a decent Attack stat in UU matches, and STAB on Return lets it really hit some Pokemon hard. When Kecleon reaches the end of its run, you can always Trick some unsuspecting Pokemon and really hurt them for the rest of the match.</p>"}}

    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>A huge Special Defense stat, decent Attack, and a massive movepool give lots of reason to use Kecleon. With just Protect and Leftovers, Kecleon has a lot of staying power, and on the offensive it can be pretty difficult to switch into. Unfortunately, the chameleon falls pretty short of being an \"NU Snorlax.\" Color Change is a huge mixed bag of an ability, and while it works in Kecleon's favor sometimes, more often than not it gives the opponent a workaround to break it faster. Most of the special attackers in the tier carry moves that are super effective against their STAB move or vice versa, and Kecleon's low Defense means most physical attackers just blow right through it. In the end, Kecleon is great on support and forms one of the most potent defensive cores in the tier with Relicanth and Chimecho, but don't expect it to \"one-man army\" the opponent.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Specially Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Kecleon is one of the best blanket checks to special attackers in NU, and this set is designed to take advantage of that fact and spread paralysis for the rest of its team. Kecleon fits best on balanced teams as a role compressor, completing a two- or three-Pokemon defensive core. Body Slam makes use of Kecleon's decent Attack stat and hits most of the specially offensive Pokemon in the tier in their weaker Defense stat. Protect allows Kecleon to scout moves, which is particularly helpful in Kecleon's case, as it allows you to more accurately predict how your opponent will play into Color Change. Shadow Ball is recommended to fill out the set, since Kecleon is one of the best answers to Haunter in the tier and it gives Kecleon something to hit Sableye with. Brick Break is a good alternative to prevent Mawile from being able to use Kecleon as complete setup bait, and it gets a decent hit on Glalie and Dewgong.</p> <p>Kecleon's movepool is huge, so there are a lot of different ways you can customize this set to suit your needs and take on the Pokemon you need to more reliably counter. Most prominently is Kecleon's huge array of coverage moves that can fill the last slot to allow it to cover certain weak points in your team structure. Icy Wind is a great option on Kecleon to slow the opposing Pokemon down to potentially stop a sweep and get a decent hit on Pupitar, Tropius, and Tangela. Fire Blast allows Kecleon to counter Bellossom and Tangela even in the sun, as long as it avoids Sleep Powder. Hidden Power Grass can be a nasty surprise for Whiscash and Relicanth thinking they can absorb Body Slam and Thunder Wave safely.</p> <p>Kecleon works best as part of a defensive core, as its lacking Defense stat leaves it very vulnerable to physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Pidgeot, and Raticate. Relicanth and Chimecho pair extremely well with Kecleon, and as a core they cover nearly every major threat in the tier between them. Relicanth in particular appreciates Kecleon's ability to absorb most Grass-type attacks, and Chimecho loves Kecleon's ability to paralyze the opposing team. In return, Relicanth easily stops Normal-types in their tracks, and Chimecho switches into Hitmonchan's Fighting-type attacks. In general, Pokemon that will appreciate Kecleon's paralysis support make the best teammates, in particular slower, bulkier sweepers such as Swords Dance Tropius, Bulk Up Hitmonchan, and Bulk Up Vigoroth.</p>"
        },
        "RestTalk": {
          "description": "<p>This set is better designed for heavy stall teams, making the absolute most of Kecleon's huge Special Defense stat to counter special attacking threats throughout a match, including even Huntail. Seismic Toss and Toxic allow Kecleon to inflict the most damage possible over an extended match, preventing it from being complete setup bait to any Pokemon apart from some Substitute users such as Whiscash. RestTalk gives Kecleon a ton of longevity, making it very hard to break for weather sweepers and opposing stall teams in particular. With a RestTalk set, Kecleon is less susceptible to its Color Change being taken advantage of by the opponent, as the recovery helps cover most mispredictions and surprise coverage moves by special attackers.</p> <p>This set should focus completely on Kecleon's Special Defense in order to best counter the special attackers in the tier throughout a match. As RestTalk Kecleon should only be used on stall teams, it should have teammates to cover its lower Defense stat. While Kecleon has no trouble walling most special attackers like Plusle and Bellossom, it has some major issues with mixed attackers and setup sweepers that can take advantage of its offensive impotence like Substitute Whiscash, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Haunter. Stall staples such as physically defensive Sableye, Roar Wailord, and Chimecho make good partners for Kecleon for this reason. Chimecho stands out for being able to check Hitmonchan, and it can carry Heal Bell to wake Kecleon more easily. As a stall team member, Kecleon appreciates Spikes support from Roselia and Glalie to more quickly wear the opposing team down with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Rapid Spin Hitmonchan also makes a good teammate to clear Spikes from your side of the field and ensure that Kecleon can more reliably check Huntail and other powerful special attackers throughout the match.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Kecleon stands out as a Choice Band user by possessing a ton of natural special bulk, allowing it to simultaneously check special attackers and threaten the opposing team offensively with its strong physical moves. While Kecleon has rock-bottom Speed as a Choice Band user, meaning it likely won't be able to sweep the opponent, it makes up for it by checking many Pokemon other similar Choice Band users, such as Pidgeot and Raticate, cannot. Return is the recommended STAB move, as Kecleon will likely be taking a lot of damage from the opponent due to its low Speed, meaning the recoil from Double-Edge is undesirable. It should be noted here that Kecleon is unlikely to keep Return as its STAB move if it switches into a special attacker's attack, so another move of your choice can easily fit this slot. Shadow Ball and Brick Break pair with Return to give Kecleon perfect neutral coverage and nail the Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-types that can switch into Return for free. Focus Punch is a decent alternative to Brick Break if you feel you can predict well due to its sheer power, but mispredicting can spell doom for Kecleon or its teammates. The last slot is reserved for Trick, which is nearly unique to Kecleon in NU. With Trick, Kecleon can completely cripple Sableye or another stall staple, such as Wailord, for the rest of the match, giving it a great niche over other similar Choice Band users.</p> <p>Kecleon is so slow that there's not much point in running any Speed; otherwise, you'll end up detracting too much from its bulk or Attack. However, if you really want Kecleon to outspeed minimum base 50s, 84 EVs can be moved from Attack to Speed. Kecleon has a few other physical moves to choose from if you want to target specific threats on the opponent's team. Aerial Ace can make for a very nasty surprise for Hitmonchan and Tangela; Rock Slide will put the hurt on the Fire- and Ice-types that Kecleon can switch into easily; and Iron Tail will hit Rock-types significantly harder than Brick Break. A Lonely nature can be run with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass as well to get a very strong hit on Tangela, Graveler, Shelgon, and Relicanth with the appropriate move.</p> <p>Choice Band Kecleon fits best on balance teams that want an offensive switch-in to special attackers in the tier in order to keep up offensive pressure and not give the opponent an opportunity to set up. Good offensive teammates to pair with Kecleon include Relicanth, Murkrow, Tangela, and Pikachu, as they have low Special Defense and lure in the special attackers that Kecleon can use to fire off strong attacks. Raticate in particular can make an effective teammate with Kecleon to clean up once the opponent's Normal-type counters have been revealed and weakened. Kecleon is very easily revenge killed due to its low Defense and Speed, meaning a physically bulky teammate that can pick up its slack is recommended. Offensive Chimecho is a good example that can switch into Hitmonchan easily, and offensive Mawile can keep up momentum with Baton Pass and check the Normal- and Flying-types that will target Kecleon's Defense.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Kecleon's movepool is very large, making many different kinds of sets possible that have not been listed above. A SubPunch set can make use of Kecleon's great bulk and ability to force switches, but Kecleon is too slow to pull this set off effectively against more offensive teams. A straight special attacking set can make use of Kecleon's huge special movepool, although it's a bit outclassed by Wigglytuff due to its higher Special Attack. However, access to Blizzard, Ice Beam, Thunder, Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Hidden Power Grass, Feint Attack, Water Pulse, and Psybeam makes Kecleon very unpredictable and tough to switch into. Screech can be used to greatly increase the damage of Kecleon's physical moves, but Kecleon is too slow to really make the most of it.</p> <p>Of particular note is Kecleon's huge array of supportive moves that have not yet been mentioned. Kecleon is probably the best user of Psych Up in the tier, as it can easily switch into a Calm Mind-boosted Sableye or Chimecho and steal the boosts, making it nigh-unbreakable with special attacks. Skill Swap is pretty gimmicky, but it can really screw over something like Flareon that can then become unable to even scratch Kecleon. Magic Coat can prevent Kecleon from being inflicted by status and bounce it back at the opponent, but RestTalk is a better method overall of preventing status from crippling Kecleon. Sunny Day and Rain Dance can be used to support the team; and Kecleon can offensively take advantage of Sunny Day with Fire Blast and Solar Beam, and it can use Thunder and Water Pulse with Rain Dance. Finally, Kecleon can use Trick with an item like Macho Brace to cripple the foe without having to use a Choice Band.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Metang is probably the safest switch-in to Kecleon as it takes little from Kecleon's STAB moves, is immune to Toxic, typically doesn't mind being paralyzed, and can target Kecleon's lower Defense stat with Meteor Mash and Earthquake. Mawile is another great switch-in as it really only fears a Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch or the uncommon Fire Blast and can lower Kecleon's Attack with Intimidate. Rock-types such as Relicanth and Sudowoodo will not appreciate being hit by Toxic, but they can also absorb Kecleon's Normal moves and nail Kecleon with a strong Rock Slide. Hitmonchan has a tougher time switching directly into Kecleon, but it can easily OHKO Kecleon with Sky Uppercut. Most strong physical attackers such as Raticate, Kingler, Piloswine, and Pidgeot can easily O-2HKO Kecleon with the appropriate move. In general, many Pokemon can take advantage of Kecleon's Color Change by changing it into a type that's weak to their coverage moves. For example, Huntail can nail Kecleon with Hydro Pump, follow up with a super effective Hidden Power Grass, and proceed to follow that up with a super effective Ice Beam. Other attackers that typically carry a move super effective to another they carry include Flareon, Bellossom, Pikachu, and Whiscash.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Tired of laying hazards only to have them spun away? Dusclops is hands down the best source of Rapid Spin protection. Its immunities to Normal and Fighting greatly benefit many teams as well, especially stall teams. Though its HP stat is low, Dusclops's immense defenses let it survive many attacks. It has a number of tricks at its disposal, and can generally be a prick with Pressure.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an alternative to Will-O-Wisp if you prefer poison to burn, but there are many more effective users of Toxic than Will-O-Wisp. Imprison can prevent opponents from using Rest or a status move, while Snatch grabs useful support effects such as Blissey's Soft-Boiled. Counter can let Dusclops catch some threats, such as Curse Snorlax and Choice Band Guts Heracross, off-guard. Hidden Power Flying can be used if you desperately need a Heracross counter, and it also helps against Breloom and Machamp.</p> <p>There are two main advantages to using Rest over Pain Split: in addition to healing it fully, Rest also cures Dusclops of status. Pain Split, on the other hand, heals Dusclops without putting it to sleep, and will also lower the opponent's health. It can even bring the likes of Blissey and Snorlax to well below 50%, and almost fully heal Dusclops when used against most healthy enemies. However, Pain Split will not be as effective against weakened opponents. With Pain Split, Dusclops will also find it difficult to actually KO its opponents, because it will be worn down alongside them, and its low Speed leaves it unable to deal a fast final blow. Rest is also the better move for PP stalling, which Dusclops does very well with its high defenses, access to Will-O-Wisp, and Pressure ability. Additionally, Pain Split doesn't remove status. Some Claydol carry Toxic, so Dusclops will likely need Rest or cleric support to reliably block Rapid Spin for long. Even if using Rest, though, Dusclops appreciates cleric support, as it removes the biggest problem of Rest: the two turns of sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Houndoom can come in on Will-O-Wisp or Shadow Ball easily and has both Crunch and Pursuit; the former hurts Dusclops if it stays in and the latter if it switches out. Tyranitar has to avoid Will-O-Wisp at all costs, but he can Substitute or Taunt, Crunch for a load of damage, or set up Dragon Dance boosts. Both of these are taken care of by a swift Focus Punch, however.</p> <p>Skarmory doesn't take much damage from physical assaults, and is not 3HKOed by Seismic Toss or Night Shade. A burn reduces Skarmory's damage output, but most of the time he will handle the damage just fine, and can set up Spikes in the meantime. Suicune survives five Seismic Tosses, and can Calm Mind up and KO with Surf. Milotic can switch in on Will-O-Wisp to activate Marvel Scale, and use either Toxic or Hypnosis to cripple Dusclops. Milotic cannot outright KO Dusclops, though.</p> <p>Guts Pokemon, namely Heracross, Ursaring, Swellow, Hariyama, and Machamp, can take advantage of Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Although their best STAB attacks won't work well--or at all--on Dusclops, their coverage moves nonetheless do a number on Dusclops; they can then proceed to clean up the rest of your team.</p>",

Dusclops even beats Blissey flat with Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and repeated Focus Punches. Even if Blissey attacks with Ice Beam, the burn will force it to recover eventually, and Dusclops will land a Focus Punch.</p> <p>36 Attack EVs guarantee Shadow Ball will OHKO Alakazam, while maximum HP is a must due to Dusclops's low HP stat. The remaining EVs can be split between Defense and Special Defense depending on what Dusclops needs it for. Defense EVs help a lot against Donphan, Heracross, Medicham, and Snorlax, while Special Defense investment buffers hits from special attackers such as Blaziken, Starmie, and Alakazam. Finally, one can run use 48 Speed EVs to outspeed Snorlax.</p>"

However, if Sleep Clause has already been activated, Dusclops can Calm Mind up to take less damage from Surf, and then Pressure stall it with Rest.</p> <p>Thunder Punch and Fire Punch are alternative attacks worth considering on this set. Maximum HP is still a must, and EVs should be concentrated in Defense as Calm Mind will boost Dusclops's Special Defense anyway.</p>"},

This does not hamper it as much as you might believe, however, as even an uninvested Regirock can survive Adamant Choice Band Medicham's High Jump Kick. Furthermore, it has crucial resistances to Normal and Flying, while Regice does not have any special resistances save Ice. With decent coverage between a STAB Rock attack and Superpower, Regirock can counter Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Salamence, and Gyarados--though watch out for Hydro Pump. Finally, if there is an enemy Pokemon your team can't handle, Regirock always has a trump card in Explosion to blast that opposing Pokemon out of the way.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute helps reduce the amount of prediction needed to use Focus Punch; being naturally bulky, Regirock also makes a good user of Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Regirock's mono-Rock typing means it matches up poorly against many threats; it is weak to Surf, Earthquake, and a variety of Fighting moves. In particular, Claydol and Flygon screw it over completely; Regirock's only options are Explosion and Counter.</p>",

Focus Punch hits almost everything that resists Rock Slide at least neutrally; however, a notable exception is Claydol.

Counter is a great move with Focus Punch, however, as it forces opponents into guessing games as to whether to attack, set up, or switch.</p> <p>Thunder Wave should usually be the first move Regirock uses, because paralysis is always handy. Remember, Regirock's massive Defense allows it to take even STAB Earthquake and retaliate with Counter for the KO. If it lacks Counter, though, this set faces obvious problems with Claydol and Flygon, as all it will be able to do is use Explosion. Considering Regirock's nice Attack stat, it can blow up many threats.</p> <p>The spread is simple and straightforward: maximize HP and Attack. An Adamant nature is recommended, but Impish is also viable thanks to its massive Defense. Note that, due to its titanic Defense and low HP, one should never give Regirock Defense EVs before investing in HP.</p>"

A Curse-boosted Explosion will take out basically every Water-type, and Regirock can often survive a Surf from most of them. The other option is Rest, which helps Regirock stick around for longer. Rock Slide can help flinch a Skarmory using Whirlwind.</p> <p>As usual, focus on HP and Attack for bulk and power. However, emphasis should be placed on Special Defense as Curse will boost Regirock's Defense to the point where, after a few Curse boosts, non-STAB Earthquakes will do a pittance to it. Do keep in mind that Regirock has decent Special Defense and can survive attacks such as unboosted Suicune's Surf and Zapdos's Thunderbolt.</p>"},
        "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>While Regirock's stats might seem more defense-oriented, it does have some great attacking moves.

In fact, the only notable Pokemon it outspeeds is Snorlax, who is hit harder by Superpower. The only reason to use Rock Slide would be to run Hidden Power Bug, which OHKOes Celebi, surprises other Grass-types, and does decent damage to Claydol. However, it is mostly inferior to the other moves.</p> <p>Again, maximize HP and Attack, and go with Adamant for a further Attack boost.</p>"},

  "Regice": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Regice holds a niche as the only special wall in ADV OU that has both a specially offensive slant and a way to remove opposing special walls through Explosion. Its powerful Ice + Electric coverage together with the threat of Thunder Wave reliably forces out fast, frail special threats like Zapdos and draws in a whole host of bulky Pokemon like Blissey, Snorlax, Metagross, and Tyranitar. As a result, Regice does not only possess the role of breaking special walls, but it also serves as a key pivot to other offensive threats like Choice Band Metagross and Moltres. A downside, however, of the variety of Regice checks is that Explosion cannot reliably target the opposing team's special wall; Metagross and Tyranitar can switch in to absorb Explosion or even any other move at a small cost.</p> <p>Despite Regice's strengths, Snorlax finds its way into offensive teams much more frequently for several reasons. First, Snorlax's Self-Destruct is extremely threatening, for even a failed attempt at taking out a special threat can result in a check like Tyranitar or Metagross being put into KO range of a sweeper like Zapdos, never allowing them to lay another hit. Second, Snorlax has solid neutral coverage for all of its checks, including Focus Punch for Tyranitar, while Regice has to deal with its checks by employing the support of teammates or giving up its walling abilities with Explosion. Regice's Explosion too is unfortunately weak and requires chip damage for the KO or momentum to be maintained for the damage to stick. Third, Snorlax's ability Immunity prevents Toxic from wearing it down when it already has limited longevity due to sand and Spikes. Regice, however, hits Skarmory really hard, and it is more effective at preventing Spikes from accumulating to an uncomfortable level. In spite of these challenges, Regice's ability of luring in and KOing Blissey and Curse Snorlax with Explosion may well be good enough of a reason to use it instead of Snorlax as a special check.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch and Superpower can spring some surprises on Tyranitar and can be used to chunk Blissey and Snorlax and eventually take them out with Explosion. Their power, however, is really dismal, as Focus Punch does not even score a guaranteed OHKO on bulkless Tyranitar. Psych Up is especially effective against Calm Mind users like Raikou, Baton Pass Celebi, and Suicune without Roar. However, using Psych Up against Roar Suicune can go terribly wrong if Regice is phazed just as it boosts, losing a vital turn and momentum. Defensive Regice variants with Rest can also be considered, though such a set is usually outclassed by Blissey and Celebi.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross in particular is the best Regice check in a vacuum, taking almost no damage from all of its moves, not suffering too much from the Speed drop of Thunder Wave, and exerting the offensive pressure necessary to force Regice out. It, however, must be wary of pivots into Dugtrio or other powerful offensive Pokemon such Fire-types, Choice Band users, and Endeavor Swampert. Forretress can threaten to set Spikes indefinitely on Regice without Fire coverage. Calm Mind Jirachi does not appreciate Thunder Wave but can optionally block it with Substitute and set up on Regice. The dislike of paralysis also applies to defensive Jirachi, but it can otherwise switch in freely and pass Wishes to teammates indefinitely.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Snorlax have the special bulk to take every special attack Regice can throw at them but must be careful not to let a well-timed Explosion take them out.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can easily force Regice out with the threat of Rock Slide or even Brick Break and Fire Blast on mixed or special variants. Unfortunately, it cannot take repeated Ice Beams. The threat of Tyranitar lies not only in the ability to directly deal damage but also the ability to set up with Dragon Dance under the status protection of Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hariyama's ability Thick Fat allows it to come in on Regice's Ice Beam without too much of a burden and hit it for super effective Fighting-type damage. While Machamp and Heracross do not switch in as easily, their ability Guts can be used to exploit Thunder Wave for extra damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: With a little chip damage, Moltres, Charizard, and Houndoom can take out Regice with their Fire-type attacks. Navigating them in, however, is not an easy task, as Thunder Wave completely strips them of the speed that earns them their place in the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Indirect Damage</strong>: With a susceptibility to sand, lack of instant recovery, and lack of a method for removing status, Regice can easily be worn down with chip damage from Spikes, Toxic, and Leech Seed. For example, Toxic + Protect Skarmory or Zapdos can force Regice in and whittle it down slowly.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Ice Beam forces Zapdos out by threatening to OHKO it under sand. It also allows Regice to turn the tables on Celebi, which is usually used to gain momentum on special walls. Other auxiliary uses of Ice Beam are providing a weak Salamence and Flygon check, especially on offensive teams that don't have good answers to physical threats; hitting Tyranitar and Swampert hard; and forcing Claydol out. Notably, Ice Beam puts Tyranitar into the KO range of Dugtrio's Earthquake and Swampert's Hydro Pump. Deterring Swampert's repeated entry into Regice as a sacrificial check is helpful if an astute opponent deduces that Regice is supporting a specially offensive team that Swampert is ineffective against anyway.</p> <p>The Electric coverage move primarily hits Skarmory to deny too many layers of Spikes, places Suicune in range of Explosion with the possibility of a Dugtrio follow-up, and forces Starmie out. It also allows Regice to be a weak check to Gyarados on the frail, specially offensive teams it frequently ends up on. Thunderbolt is by far more consistent, and its accuracy may be vital when facing key threats like Gyarados and Starmie, but Thunder pressures Skarmory more with the certain 2HKO, assuming it hits. When using Hidden Power Fire, the paralysis rate of Thunder can also serve to compress Electric coverage and Thunder Wave into one move.</p> <p>Explosion severely damages special walls like Blissey that switch into Regice. Additionally, it limits the setup opportunities of Curse Snorlax, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Jirachi by getting a check like Swampert or Dugtrio in without taking any damage and denting them just enough for a follow-up KO. Explosion with 104 Attack EVs allows Dugtrio to follow up on most Curse Snorlax under sand with a guaranteed KO.</p> <p>Note that Explosion on teams without Dugtrio can be pretty dismal, so Hidden Power Fire can be used over Explosion to pressure offensive teams more readily, as long as one plans to exert offensive pressure on Blissey or Snorlax through some other means. Hidden Power Fire also reduces Metagross's ease of switching in and makes quick work of Magneton, which can potentially nullify Regice with Toxic + Protect. It also prevents Forretress from setting Spikes indefinitely.</p> <p>Thunder Wave reliably forces Jolteon and non-Substitute offensive variants of Jirachi out while paralyzing checks with average Speed like Tyranitar, Metagross, and defensive Jirachi. While paralyzing these bulky Pokemon may seem innocuous at first glance, the Speed drop gives one's own Metagross and Tyranitar the assurance of outspeeding the foe and maintains offensive momentum. Finally, Hidden Power Fire can also be an option over Thunder Wave for reasons above.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Regice has two roles: a lure for special walls and pivot into special threats and out of bulky Pokemon. In its role as a lure, it appreciates Dugtrio finishing off the weakened wall after Explosion. Regice, however, can still function perfectly fine without Dugtrio if the team can maintain momentum on the walls. Note that without Dugtrio, these frail offensive teams that Regice tends to end up on need a way to prevent Dragon Dance Tyranitar from running amok. Regice paves the way for either fast special sweepers like Ludicolo and Starmie or Calm Mind sweepers like Suicune, Raikou, and Jirachi. In its role as an offensive pivot, Regice can easily switch or double switch to Choice Band Metagross upon the entrance of Blissey, Snorlax, or Tyranitar. It can also pivot to Moltres or Charizard in anticipation of Metagross. Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is particularly synergistic with Regice; Celebi acts as a secondary special check against Zapdos, Starmie, and Suicune and can pass boosts to Regice to really press Blissey or Snorlax to come in. Giga Drain and Hidden Power Fire are also great for chunking Tyranitar and Metagross, and it helps that these Pokemon are frequently very willing to stay in on Celebi to hit it back with Hidden Power Bug or Meteor Mash.</p>"

Sleep Talk makes Arbok a better soft check to offensive Bellossom and lets it absorb Venomoth's Sleep Powder, although Double-Edge is a good alternative if hitting Whiscash harder is desired, and it has good neutral coverage. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature lets Arbok outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan and Speed tie with Glalie, and maximum Attack investment alongside a Choice Band helps Arbok pressure its switch-ins as much as possible. Intimidate helps Arbok against other leads such as Hitmonchan, Sudowoodo, and Relicanth.</p> <p>There's very little that goes into successfully using Arbok; for the most part, simply focus on predicting switches correctly and using the appropriate coverage move. Arbok's use outside of counterleading certain foes is mostly limited to using its defensive utility to pivot into non-Earthquake Hitmonchan and Sunny Day + Solar Beam users like Bellossom and Tropius to get more wallbreaking opportunities. Something to keep in mind is how low drawback using Sludge Bomb is; only two relevant Pokemon are immune to it, and those that resist it dislike being poisoned.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is a fantastic partner because it can trap Steel- and Rock-types, which enables Arbok to spam Sludge Bomb more reliably.

Arbok can struggle to break through Pokemon such as Whiscash and Sableye that it lacks a super effective coverage move for; therefore, pairing it with a Spiker such as Roselia or Cacturne is ideal, giving it better odds to 2HKO them. Additionally, teammates like Wailord and Bellossom are beneficial to deal with Ground-types; Wailord also deals with Metang and Mawile.</p>"

  "Dugtrio": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Dugtrio is the most prominent trapper in ADV. Almost every team has trap targets, such as physically bulky Pokemon, Calm Mind users, special walls, Fighting-types, bulky setup tanks, and even other trappers. This lets it support a variety of offensive and defensive teamstyles. Dugtrio's high Speed also makes it a great revenge killer against many offensive Pokemon such as Endeavor Swampert and Starmie. These properties make it a common sight on specially offensive teams, Spikes teams, and teams dedicated to supporting bulky setup tanks.</p> <p>Dugtrio's biggest weakness is its frailty. If it fails to KO the trap target, it is very likely to be OHKOed in return. Dugtrio also can be exploited when Choice locked, giving sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence free setup turns. Ironically, being Choice locked also lets opposing Dugtrio countertrap Dugtrio; likewise, Porygon2 can trap it by copying Arena Trap with Trace. Both foes can punish teams for relying on Dugtrio to trap multiple Pokemon, its biggest strength: the first target can bait Dugtrio in for either countertrapper to revenge kill it, letting the second target wreak havoc.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dugtrio's last moveslot is usually disposable. As a result, a variety of different moves can be run at almost no cost. Substitute or Protect can be used in conjunction with Perish Song Gengar to provide the additional turns needed for Perish Song to take effect. Screech can be used to defeat defensive Suicune and Snorlax; one can force them to use Rest, then go to Dugtrio and use Screech. Dugtrio can take them out the next time Rest is used, or it can just be sacrificed to apply a -4 Defense drop so that a physically offensive Pokemon can follow up and break through. Rock Tomb is an alternative to Rock Slide to be used while sacrificing Dugtrio. It can help a slow Pokemon to come in next and prevents Dugtrio from being setup bait for Dragon Dance Salamence; its poor accuracy makes it unreliable, though. Toxic can be used as a catch-all against a variety of Pokemon like Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, Flygon, and Swampert.</p> <p>Dugtrio can also carry other items. The most prominent alternative is Salac Berry, which, when used with Endure, allows Dugtrio to reliably trap other Dugtrio. This also lets it run considerably less Speed investment in favor of bulk to trap Blissey and remove it with Beat Up. Occasionally, Endure and Salac Berry also turn the tides against Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Jolteon, and Starmie, which the opponent may bring in with the intent of outspeeding Dugtrio, especially after noticing the bulky EVs. Soft Sand can be used on Jolly bulky Dugtrio in conjunction with Timid Zapdos, letting Dugtrio still have enough power to revenge kill Tyranitar after Zapdos sacrifices itself to Tyranitar by using Thunderbolt. When Soft Sand is used in conjunction with Toxic, Dugtrio can lure in opposing Zapdos, prevent Salamence from setting up freely, and also weaken Porygon2 trying to countertrap it. King's Rock gives Beat Up an appreciable chance to flinch, but not quite enough for it to be reliable at removing Blissey without Dugtrio taking damage. These alternative items, while offering the flexibility of move choice, pale greatly in comparison to Choice Band because Dugtrio's power is greatly reduced when trapping anything apart from Blissey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Dugtrio is a trapper, it has no true checks. However, it can be countertrapped or exploited in the following ways.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 is the universal answer to Dugtrio, as it can safely come in on any of its moves, copy Arena Trap with Trace, and take Dugtrio out with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can be countertrapped by opposing Dugtrio should it be slow or use a move other than Earthquake. This usually occurs after Dugtrio traps Celebi, Heracross, or Breloom. Opposing Celebi is able to use Baton Pass, should it survive Hidden Power Bug, to bring opposing Dugtrio in safely.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Tyranitar</strong>: If Dugtrio is chipped, Pursuit Tyranitar can trap Dugtrio locked onto any move other than Earthquake. This usually occurs when Spikes are present or when Breloom fires off a Mach Punch before Dugtrio KOes it.</p> <p><strong>Speed-boosting Setup Sweepers</strong>: After a KO, Dugtrio is very vulnerable to getting set up on. Dragon Dance Salamence and Agility Zapdos get a free boost; Salamence can proceed to sweep frail teams that rely on Dugtrio too much for checking physical threats, while Agility Zapdos can pass the boost to a slow teammate that then outspeeds Dugtrio and cannot be revenge killed by it anymore. Even Agility Metagross and Dragon Dance Tyranitar can set up on Dugtrio locked into any move other than Earthquake. Ninjask, while rare, is one of the biggest threats to Dugtrio teams without a phazer, as it can pass both Speed and Attack boosts to a sweeper with merely a single setup turn.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Many Flying-types like mixed and Choice Band Salamence, Aerodactyl, Zapdos, and Moltres have the immediate firepower to be particularly threatening after Dugtrio removes a foe. Even Skarmory can exploit the free turn to lay Spikes, and Gengar, while not a Flying-type, is immune to Earthquake and can fire off a devastating Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake's primary targets are Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, Magneton, Blissey, and Starmie. Bulky Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, and Starmie fall after a tiny amount of chip damage, Magneton gets OHKOed, and Blissey gets 2HKOed in sand. Earthquake also hits Snorlax and Suicune hard, allowing Dugtrio to revenge kill offensive variants and sometimes take out defensive variants by coming in on a Rest turn. Hidden Power Bug takes out Celebi with some chip damage. Aerial Ace OHKOes Heracross and Breloom. Rock Slide is the generic option in the last moveslot for hitting threatening Flying-types like Zapdos, Salamence, Moltres; this especially strengthens Dugtrio as an emergency pivot into Zapdos. Sunny Day is a common move alongside tanks that are affected by sand, namely defensive Suicune and Snorlax.</p> <p>Beat Up is a niche option on specially offensive teams. It has several advantages over Earthquake in dealing with Blissey. First, many specially offensive partners like Zapdos, Celebi, Suicune, and Raikou have high base Attack, and Beat Up does damage based on the base Attack stats of all team members, so it more often than not does massive damage to Blissey, 2HKOing it comfortably even without sand. Alternatively, a specially offensive Pokemon can lure Blissey in, apply Toxic poison, and switch to Beat Up Dugtrio, which deals enough damage that Blissey won't ever be able to heal. Second, as Beat Up damage is independent of natures and EVs, Dugtrio is free to drop Attack investment in favor of bulk and Speed; the bulk helps Dugtrio survive Blissey's Ice Beam, Jirachi's Ice Punch, and Celebi's Grass-type attacks, increasing its reliability in trapping special walls; the Speed helps it revenge kill offensive Jirachi, offensive Celebi, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Third, Counter fails on Beat Up, so Blissey has no way to OHKO bulky Dugtrio back. Note that Beat Up does not necessarily have to be used with a bulky EV spread.</p> <p>Dugtrio usually wants all the Attack it can get to reduce the amount of chip damage needed to KO its targets. Maximum Speed is useful for tying other Dugtrio that might try to revenge kill Dugtrio itself; otherwise, an EV spread of 8 HP / 252 Atk / 20 SpD / 228 Spe with IVs of 30 SpD / 30 Spe lets Adamant / Jolly Dugtrio outspeed neutral / positive nature +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, respectively. The extra bulk gives Dugtrio greater odds of surviving attacks like Hidden Power Ice or Grass from specially offensive Pokemon and super effective coverage from Blissey, Celebi, and Jirachi. One should avoid placing the remaining 4 EVs into HP, though it may seem inconsequential, as Dugtrio otherwise faints from four times of switching into three layers of Spikes. This may occur if Skarmory continuously forces Dugtrio in.</p> <p>Note that the above EV spreads more often than not do not apply to Beat Up Dugtrio, which frequently runs bulky spreads to survive Blissey's Ice Beam under various conditions. The most common spread is 80 HP / 252 Atk / 172 SpD / 4 Spe for surviving Blissey's Ice Beam after one layer of Spikes. With a Jolly nature, Dugtrio still outspeeds base 100 neutral-natured Pokemon.</p> <p>A Jolly nature allows Dugtrio to outspeed all +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Starmie, and Salac Berry-boosted Endeavor Swampert. This is the better nature for revenge killing. An Adamant nature, however, ensures the OHKO on uninvested Tyranitar, requires less chip damage to KO many targets, and also gives Dugtrio a good chance to 3HKO defensive Suicune and defensive Snorlax after a Curse. Adamant is really helpful on defensive Suicune teams, where Dugtrio can eliminate bulky Tyranitar as fast as possible before Suicune takes too much damage to set up, and defensive Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams, where Dugtrio provides the sole offensive pressure needed against a late-game Suicune or Snorlax. Occasionally, maximizing the odds of revenge killing a full HP Tyranitar is also useful, such as when Tyranitar OHKOes Jynx after it misses Lovely Kiss and when Charizard uses Focus Punch to stop Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up but gets OHKOed by Rock Slide.</p> <p>When using balance teams where every Pokemon fulfills mostly an indispensable role and cannot easily be sacrificed, Dugtrio is best brought in on a predicted switch into the trap target after it has been chipped. On offensive teams, however, in addition to trapping special walls, Dugtrio can be used more as a revenge killer, performing one-for-one trades. Frequently, Baton Pass users like Zapdos and Celebi help ease predictions and guide Dugtrio into Blissey and Tyranitar, for example.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dugtrio's targets can generally be categorized into physically bulky Pokemon, Calm Mind users, special walls, Fighting-types, bulky setup tanks, and trappers. Dugtrio teams can be broadly categorized into specially offensive teams, Skarmory or Forretress + Dugtrio stall teams, and teams dedicated to setting up bulky tanks.</p> <p>Specially offensive teams with offensive Calm Mind users like Celebi, Jirachi, and Suicune, or special sweepers like Starmie and Rain Dance users Kingdra and Ludicolo, all appreciate special walls removed. A great way of luring in special walls, particularly Blissey, is through using Zapdos, which can use Baton Pass to eliminate prediction involved in safely bringing Dugtrio in. A niche Pokemon that also does the job is lead Jynx, which frequently forces the opponent to go to Blissey right after having a Pokemon slept. As physically bulky Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Snorlax are checks to Calm Mind users, Dugtrio removing, or at least weakening, these checks also helps them. Removing Tyranitar also allows Kingdra and Ludicolo to use Rain Dance unimpeded. Sometimes, specially offensive teams carry Gengar, which not only can use Explosion with Dugtrio as follow-up to remove special walls, but can also lure in and eliminate Pursuit Tyranitar to help these Rain Dance users keep rain up. As specially offensive teams frequently use frail Zapdos as a Fighting-type check, Dugtrio helps to revenge kill Heracross and Breloom.</p> <p>One common theme in offensive Dugtrio teams is using two Pokemon that are weak to Dugtrio: one lures in opposing Dugtrio to be counter-trapped, which enables the other. Most prominently, Celebi luring in Dugtrio allows Jirachi free rein. Heracross and Breloom act similarly; although they are not specially offensive, some offensive Dugtrio teams appreciate them pressuring Blissey and hurting Skarmory decently. Breloom also appreciates Dugtrio's trades reducing the game to a small number of Pokemon, making Spore much more devastating. Mixed and Choice Band Tyranitar are also physically offensive presences with good Dugtrio synergy. Mixed Tyranitar has the coverage to nail the Pokemon that Dugtrio cannot trap and eliminate easily—Swampert and Flying-types—and Dugtrio can trap those that it has trouble with—Metagross, Jirachi, and Celebi. Choice Band Tyranitar similarly deters Flying-types with Rock Slide and has Focus Punch to hit Water-types hard; should it mistakenly lock itself with Rock Slide or Double-Edge into Metagross or Jirachi, Dugtrio can revenge kill them. Like Zapdos, the uncommon offensive Vaporeon can lure in special walls and guide Dugtrio safely in, especially against Blissey, with Baton Pass and its 101 HP Substitutes. However, one must be keenly aware of the possible physical weaknesses that come with using both offensive Vaporeon and Dugtrio on the same team. Finally, as a general point, specially offensive teams frequently lack phazers, so they can run into serious trouble should opposing offensive Calm Mind users set up first. In this scenario, having Dugtrio as a revenge killer is very useful too.</p> <p>Skarmory and Dugtrio have amazing synergy on stall teams. Skarmory's Spikes provide the chip damage necessary for Dugtrio to remove Tyranitar, Metagross, Celebi, and Jirachi. In turn, Dugtrio traps Magneton, as well as offensive Starmie after chip damage from Spikes or Toxic to prevent it from spinning. Taking down physical wallbreakers like Tyranitar and Metagross, and letting Skarmory handle them for longer against Magneton teams, protects Water-types that are vulnerable to sand and Spikes like Suicune and Milotic from being overwhelmed or eating an Explosion. Removing Tyranitar also allows one to clear sand, possibly with Sunny Day, extending Suicune's longevity. Dugtrio also mitigates the propensity of these Water-types to be set up on or neutered with Leech Seed by Jirachi and Celebi. Defensive Gengar forms a fantastic core with Skarmory and Dugtrio, as it can spinblock and have Dugtrio severely weaken or remove Pursuit Tyranitar. Spinners are good Dugtrio partners on stall teams, as opposing Skarmory gets to set Spikes freely after a revenge kill, and stall teams frequently lack offensive pressure against Skarmory. Claydol, apart from removing Spikes to ease the pressure on Suicune, Milotic, and Blissey, works with Dugtrio to strengthen the team's defenses against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Claydol can also be sacrificed to Heracross for Dugtrio to revenge kill it, since Heracross rarely comes with Spikes. Forretress is another Spiker and spinner that synergizes with Dugtrio. Even though Forretress, unlike Skarmory, can run Earthquake to address Magneton switch-ins, Dugtrio trapping Magneton allows Forretress to use Hidden Power Bug and Explosion simultaneously. Dugtrio also makes up for Forretress's inability to threaten Fighting-types, trapping Heracross and Breloom, or phaze like Skarmory. Dugtrio prevents the opponent from exploiting Forretress's passivity by trapping Calm Mind Celebi and Jirachi, as well as safeguarding against Metagross, which can easily run through Forretress if it has Choice Band, gets a boost from Meteor Mash, or Forretress is previously chipped significantly. Although it is common to overlook the offensive properties of Claydol and Forretress on stall teams, in many cases, their Explosions guarantee a trade when Dugtrio is available for revenge killing. Trading with Tyranitar eases the pressure on Blissey and Suicune and allows sand to be cleared permanently, while trading with Metagross eliminates the potential threat of Explosion to Suicune and Milotic. Finally, there is a small but noteworthy fraction of Skarmory + Dugtrio teams that use Swampert. These are usually Toxic, Spikes and Sandstorm (TSS) teams that don't do well against defensive Suicune if Skarmory is trapped and Spikes are removed; in this case, having Dugtrio to beat Rest Suicune can be important.</p> <p>Teams dedicated to supporting setup tanks like defensive Suicune, defensive Curse Snorlax, and Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi form the remainder of Dugtrio-based teams. Suicune has been explained above, and the arguments pertaining to Snorlax and Jirachi are similar. Once again, Tyranitar, Metagross, Celebi, and Jirachi are prime trap targets. Tyranitar's sand hurts Snorlax's longevity, and Tyranitar walls Snorlax and Jirachi. Metagross also walls Snorlax and can hit it with Explosion, and Jirachi without Fire Punch finds it difficult to get past Metagross. Leech Seed Celebi makes it very difficult for these tanks to set up, while Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi can exploit the lack of early-game pressure from these teams to pass boosts to threatening offensive Pokemon. Opposing Calm Mind Jirachi can set up on Snorlax, and it is never good to get your Jirachi into a Calm Mind war with opposing Jirachi; even if one's Jirachi wins the tussle, there is a good chance that it will be crippled by burn or paralysis. Removing opposing trappers can also be a benefit in rather subtle ways. Opposing Magneton and Dugtrio can keep forcing Snorlax to use Rest until they score a critical hit, and Magneton can also paralyze Jirachi in a pinch, whereas Dugtrio can trap and severely weaken, if not remove, Jirachi. These setup-based teams tend to be weak to Fighting-types, so removing Heracross and Breloom is also important. Finally, if one does not use Spikes, then one needs an alternative way to chip trap targets into range. Defensive Celebi's Leech Seed and Blissey's Toxic are prominent methods of inducing chip damage on stall teams lacking Spikes. Celebi can also lure in Tyranitar and Metagross and use Baton Pass to safely switch to Dugtrio, eliminating the need for prediction.</p> <p>Occasionally, Dugtrio appears on balance teams that do not necessarily use Spikes, but use Pokemon mentioned above and follow similar logic. These include Choice Band Tyranitar, Wish Jirachi, and Claydol.</p>"

Hidden Power Flying can be run over Hidden Power Ghost or Fighting to threaten Shuppet while also providing Farfetch'd with a STAB move to hit Pokemon like Bayleef with when not in range of Flail. Quick Attack is also an option to make Farfetch'd less vulnerable to priority and allow it to revenge kill faster foes, but you have to forego a crucial coverage move for it.

        "Flail Cleaner": {
          "description": "<p>Farfetch'd cements itself as a solid cleaner due to having access to Flail and Swords Dance. This allows it to OHKO various physical walls in the tier like Koffing, making it a scary offensive cleaner with a Salac Berry late-game. Flail is Farfetch'd's strongest move when at low HP, with it being able to OHKO or heavily damage even Normal-resistant Pokemon like Magnemite and Rhyhorn when boosted. Hidden Power Ghost is used to threaten Shuppet, which would otherwise be a hard wall thanks to its Normal immunity, but leaves Farfetch'd vulnerable to Aron. To remedy this, Farfetch'd can run Hidden Power Fighting to threaten Aron, but this leaves it completely walled by Shuppet. Substitute allows Farfetch'd to put itself in range of Salac Berry, power up Flail to its maximum strength, and take advantage of switches. Swords Dance allows Farfetch'd to reach offensive thresholds like OHKOing Magnemite and doing 72-85% to Rhyhorn with maximum power Flail, which can be crucial in Farfetch'd's clean late-game. Lastly, a Salac Berry allows Farfetch'd to outspeed the entire metagame, allowing it to clean with its only worry being priority users like Elekid, Pidgeotto, and Cyndaquil. Inner Focus is the preferred ability to stop flinches from Fake Out users like Meowth.</p> <p>Farfetch'd is usually found on offensive teams or teams that rely on status to give Farfetch'd more opportunities to set up. Pokemon like Magnemite and Delcatty that spread paralysis through Body Slam and Thunder Wave make good teammates for this reason, with Butterfree also standing out thanks to having Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Farfetch'd also appreciates Pokemon that can pressure Rock- and Steel-types such as Lileep, Aron, and Rhyhorn, so Seaking, Growlithe, and Koffing can be great partners. Farfetch'd can be vulnerable to priority from Pokemon like Elekid, Pidgeotto, and Cyndaquil when set up, so Pokemon like Rhyhorn, Geodude, and Delcatty can help Farfetch'd deal with these foes. Additionally, Pokemon like Aipom and Elekid outspeed Farfetch'd and threaten an OHKO with Double-Edge and Thunderbolt, respectively, so it benefits from teammates like Rhyhorn, Lileep, and Chinchou that can deal with these Pokemon.</p>"

Thanks to its awesome STAB Drill Peck, Dodrio can be a true monster if its teammates can take out physical walls that stop it short. However, it's really fragile and won't be switching in on much.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Baton Pass is a great option as Dodrio can pass along a Substitute or some Speed to really help a teammate set up. It can also use Baton Pass on the first turn to scout out your opponent's Dodrio counter; if it is Skarmory, bring in Magneton for an instant KO. Similarly, passing to Dugtrio can end a weakened Tyranitar or Metagross switch-in. Endeavor can be used in conjunction with Quick Attack to make short work of opposing Pokemon, but Tyranitar's Sand Stream can prove troublesome. Haze can remove an opponent's boosts, but it is fairly useless overall because Dodrio is fragile. In general, Dodrio's base 110 Attack and base 100 Speed stats mean it's best off with an offensive moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory and Forretress, two of the most common physical walls, can handle Dodrio with relative ease--watch out for Magneton, however. Tyranitar's Sand Stream wears down Dodrio, and Tyranitar himself resists both Dodrio's STAB moves. However, Choice Band Hidden Power Ground can 2HKO it, and Hidden Power Fighting will OHKO. Metagross can shrug off nearly everything Dodrio throws at it; even Choice Band Hidden Power Ground might not 2HKO him. Regirock is one of the best counters as well, because neither Hidden Power will do much damage. The latter three can easily OHKO Dodrio with their STAB moves.</p> <p>Gengar can come in on Normal attacks and either Thunderbolt Dodrio into oblivion or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Choice Band Drill Peck will OHKO him more often than not, though, and Flail sets usually pack Hidden Power Ghost. Dusclops is slower but more defensive, and has the same immunity to Normal attacks; he can burn Dodrio and heal off damage with Pain Split or Rest. Just about any hit, especially STAB or super effective ones, will cripple--if not KO--Dodrio, as its defenses are abysmal at best.</p>",

Hidden Power Ground hurts Magneton, Jirachi, and Metagross on the switch-in, but Dodrio should not stay in unless it will surely OHKO the foe. Hidden Power Fighting is stronger against Tyranitar, but is inferior as Hidden Power Ground will do just fine while maintaining a perfect Speed IV.</p> <p>Maximize Attack and Speed because Dodrio will not stay in for long anyway.

Alternately, Dodrio could use a Salac Berry, run at least 112 EVs, and drop Agility for another move. Quick Attack is its best choice to help against enemy Flail users.</p> <p>Similarly, use maximum Attack, and dump the rest of the EVs in HP for greater overall bulk.

  "Gengar": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Gengar is a centralizing threat in ADV OU with amazing versatility. It boasts high Special Attack and Speed, which are both integral to its utility and offensive roles. In addition, one would be mistaken to assume that it is a glass cannon based on its poor defensive stats. It has immunities to Normal-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks and a resistance to Bug-type attacks, providing it with an abundance of opportunities to pivot in on mixed and physical variants of Salamence, Heracross, Snorlax, Swampert, Flygon, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Body Slam Jirachi. It even gets opportunities to pivot in on Toxic. Gengar also has very few weaknesses that aren't widely distributed, making its selection of checks highly specific.</p> <p>One of Gengar's greatest assets is its ability to spinblock allowing Spikes to remain on the field. Another major boon to Gengar is its unique set of utility moves, which almost no Pokemon is completely able to shrug off; in particular, Will-O-Wisp severely threatens every non-Fire-type without Natural Cure, and even those that do get their recovery shut down by Taunt, making Gengar highly effective at pressuring passive Pokemon like Blissey and Milotic too. Offensively, Gengar's selection of coverage moves allows it to be an effective sweeper with Spikes support. As a dedicated Blissey lure, Gengar can even use Mean Look + Perish Song or Explosion in conjunction with Dugtrio, allowing specially offensive pokemon to sweep.</p> <p>While Gengar has many strengths, its propensity to be trapped, lack of STAB moves, and slight frailty hold it back. Pursuit Tyranitar OHKOes any Gengar that isn't properly EV trained to survive it. The lack of STAB moves but an abundance of coverage means that Gengar is not suited for consistently firing off strong neutral hits early-game, although it gets exponentially better with Spikes. Its low defensive stats can somewhat be compensated for through EV investment, but at the expense of a crucial amount of Speed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dynamic Punch is a risky move that has huge upsides when Gengar is facing Pursuit Tyranitar, but its accuracy makes it highly unreliable. Thief can be used to slowly chip at special walls, but the constant pressure of Will-O-Wisp + Taunt or the immediacy of Explosion makes it hard to justify its use. Focus Punch can be a choice on the all-out attacker set to take down an unsuspecting Blissey or Tyranitar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are very few definite checks and counters to Gengar, and the most prevalent Gengar checks are defensive Pokemon. However, offensive teams can try their best to trade humongous amounts of damage in return for taking Will-O-Wisp from Gengar, use Lum Berry on the Pokemon that are weakest to burn like Metagross and Tyranitar, and try not to let Gengar in at all.</p> <p><strong>Natural Cure</strong>: Blissey and Celebi both pivot into Will-O-Wisp with the intention of encouraging Gengar to switch out by chipping it with Ice Beam or threatening it with a potential Psychic, respectively, and healing the status away with Natural Cure. Of the lot, Blissey is the most robust; its Normal typing does not allow Gengar to take any advantage of it with its elemental coverage. Celebi is more susceptible to Gengar's coverage, but it is usually able to survive Will-O-Wisp and two Ice Punches if it's using the defensive set to 2HKO back with Psychic. Making the right reads, however, is crucial to prevent too many exploits by physical threats that follow up from Gengar. Starmie gets 2HKOed by Thunderbolt and only OHKOes Gengar after some chip damage, but it can still act as a one-time pivot. Refresh users are less reliable against Taunt Gengar but also act similarly if push comes to shove. Swampert can deal with Gengar lacking Grass-type coverage moves, and Milotic can try to wrestle against Gengar lacking Electric-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit Tyranitar is the bane of Gengar's existence, forcing the Gengar user to make the decision between staying in to wrestle Tyranitar or switching out and taking a huge chunk of damage or possibly getting KOed. Pursuit Tyranitar is best at taking out defensive Gengar. It is not a reliable trapper, however, as it does not OHKO defensive Gengar, and Dugtrio might be waiting behind. Gengar may also end up on the winning end by inflicting a burn and hitting Tyranitar with a Grass-type coverage move, if Tyranitar chooses to use Pursuit while Gengar stays in. Offensive Gengar might also be able to beat Tyranitar by using Hidden Power Grass or Hypnosis on the switch and outplaying Tyranitar. Pursuit Umbreon has a little more longevity with Wish and can burn Gengar back with Synchronize, but it is rarely used because its passivity allows Metagross and Skarmory to come in freely. Pursuit Houndoom is able to OHKO Gengar with good odds, but it is rather frail, susceptible to the Dugtrio trap, and offers almost no defensive utility otherwise. Metagross can scare the opponent with Psychic and catch Gengar with Pursuit on the switch while retaining the wallbreaking properties of mixed Metagross, but it needs a one-time Will-O-Wisp pivot on the team, as it too is not anywhere close to OHKOing Gengar with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types can threaten Gengar with Thunder Wave or a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Jolteon is by far the most reliable Gengar check among the Electric-types, as it does not suffer a weakness against any of Gengar's coverage moves, and, since it's a fast specially offensive Pokemon that relies more on its Speed rather than its bulk to win games, it does not fear Will-O-Wisp too much. However, it will still be worn down by the burn over time. Magneton can deal with Gengar lacking Fire Punch and notably resists Explosion. Zapdos can reliably deal with Gengar lacking Ice Punch, but short of that, it will require pivoting in on a move other than Ice Punch and will have to rely on its Speed or good reads to neuter Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Unrevealed Moltres and Charizard serve as offensive checks to Gengar by pivoting into Will-O-Wisp. Moltres can then threaten to OHKO Gengar with Overheat. Charizard either outspeeds Gengar and hits it hard with Fire Blast or survives Thunderbolt to OHKO it with a Blaze-boosted Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Guts</strong>: Guts users like Heracross—especially the Hidden Power Ghost variant—and Machamp can act as one-time pivots into Gengar's Will-O-Wisp or simply come out in the game before Gengar in an attempt to trade it down.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Special Checks</strong>: Snorlax and Regice can take a few hits from offensive Gengar's coverage moves. Snorlax, however, does not appreciate getting burned. Regice's Special Attack stat is unaffected by the burn, but sending Regice in to take the burn is still not ideal, as Explosion is going to do a miserable amount of damage as a result.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Gengar is most commonly used on teams that use indirect damage from sand and Spikes, and they are canonically referred to as Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams. This set maintains pressure on both defensive and offensive Pokemon with a well-balanced combination of utility and coverage moves. Will-O-Wisp stings everything bar Fire-types and Natural Cure Pokemon. On the anti-offense side, it completely invalidates physical threats like Metagross, Tyranitar, and Snorlax. On the stallbreaking side, it turns the long game from an asset into a liability by ensuring that defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Swampert, and Jirachi lose HP the more turns they stay in. Even Natural Cure Pokemon like Blissey and Celebi don't exactly gain momentum on Gengar, as the added Spikes damage frequently forces them to make an attempt at recovering.</p> <p>Taunt makes this possible, providing additional pressure by preventing Blissey and, if you're daring, Celebi from healing up, keeping them at low HP throughout the game. Taunt also maintains pressure on passive Pokemon by denying Swampert, Milotic, and Claydol from using Refresh and Suicune and Snorlax from using Rest. Taunt also allows Gengar's teammates to come in without fear of status effects. Defensively, Taunt is also an emergency measure that prevents Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Calm Mind Jirachi from setting up and sweeping. Explosion is a slightly riskier and more targeted option than Taunt. Instead of playing the patient game with Taunt, Explosion seeks to blow through Blissey when the time is right for a sweeper at the back like Starmie, Zapdos, offensive Suicune, or offensive Jirachi. Explosion also helps to hammer through Zapdos + Celebi specially defensive cores, take out Claydol after an Ice Punch, thereby retaining Spikes for the rest of the game, and ending the turn to prevent the foe from setting up just like Taunt and enabling a Dugtrio trap. Although a rare choice, Destiny Bond can be used to lure in and remove Claydol more reliably, and also to remove key offensive threats.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Ice Punch provide neutral coverage for most of the metagame. In particular, Thunderbolt helps Gengar deal with the likes of Starmie trying to muscle through it to get a Rapid Spin off, allows it to beat Moltres and defensive Suicune one-on-one, and lets it check Gyarados. Ice Punch deals with Spikes-immune threats, namely Zapdos, Salamence, and Flygon, while providing extra pressure against Celebi. Note that with Ice Punch, Gengar is one of the rare mixed Salamence pivots and can even offensively check Dragon Dance Salamence with the right EVs. Occasionally, Explosion can be used over Thunderbolt or Ice Punch as a sacrificial stop against spinners and special walls.</p> <p>Fire Punch and Giga Drain are alternatives coverage moves. They are, however, less commonly seen, as Gengar would then be completely walled by Moltres and Charizard, it couldn't serve as a reliable check against Salamence, and it would be forced out by Zapdos. Notably, though, Giga Drain provides Gengar with an opportunity to wrestle Pursuit Tyranitar one-on-one, especially with the aid of Will-O-Wisp and Spikes, and it improves the matchup against Claydol by healing off the damage from Psychic, turning it into a 3HKO instead. While the inability to hit Zapdos and Moltres hard may be seen as a weakness, this coverage combination may instead be used as a way to lure in and remove them through Explosion.</p> <p>The listed EV spread allows Gengar to switch out in the face of Tyranitar's Pursuit without getting KOed in sand and to survive Salamence's and Gyarados's boosted Hidden Power Flying in sand, all while outspeeding Timid Moltres. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 60 SpD / 200 Spe allows Gengar to survive Tyranitar's Pursuit, which equates to about a half chance of surviving it in sand, and boosted Hidden Power Flying from Salamence half the time in addition to outspeeding Timid Zapdos, Jolly Salamence, maximum Speed Tyranitar with a neutral nature after a Dragon Dance, and even some Adamant Dugtrio that forgo Speed investment. Don't underestimate the value of a Gengar kept around only to get KOed by sand as it comes in; it provides an extra turn to spinblock and can be used sacrificially to bring a threatening sweeper like Aerodactyl in. A spread of 168 HP / 164 SpD / 176 Spe guarantees surviving Tyranitar's Pursuit in sand while offering virtually no protection against Salamence, yet maintaining the Speed advantage over Timid Zapdos and Jolly Salamence. This spread also allows it to survive Aerodactyl's Rock Slide under sand. Preserving Gengar under sand even after taking Pursuit can be extremely helpful when one has Dugtrio to trap Tyranitar, and especially if one faces Forretress.</p> <p>Against stall teams, defensive Gengar should be used to play a patient game of constant pressure by keeping the opponent's special walls in a perpetual recover loop through Spikes, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt. This creates multiple opportunities for a physical threat like Tyranitar to exert pressure and eventually force either the physical or special walls to crumble, allowing one's sweeper to take over. Against offensive teams, defensive Gengar can pivot in by exploiting its plethora of immunities and resistances to fire off Will-O-Wisp and punish their lack of status removal options, and keeping Gengar healthy might be all that is needed to stave off a late-game threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Gengar mostly belongs on TSS teams. A Spiker is almost mandatory to exploit Gengar's ability to spinblock and force switches. The Spiker of choice is Skarmory most of the time, but on more offensive teams it can be Cloyster. To help the Spikes damage stick, Tyranitar is also frequently used as a partner. In particular, bulky physical Tyranitar is the best set at exploiting Spikes, as it easily comes in on Blissey and forces it to switch after Gengar has prevented Blissey from recovering. Other mid-game attackers that appreciate Spikes and that benefit from Gengar's spinblocking support are Moltres and perhaps even Zapdos. Finally, Gengar enables generic late-game sweepers like Starmie and Aerodactyl to sweep.</p> <p>This Gengar set generally intends to play the long game and does not immediately threaten special threats like Jolteon, Zapdos, and Moltres, so robust special walls that also act as status absorbers like Blissey and Celebi are good partners. Defensive Jirachi can also act as a special wall that keeps Gengar healthy with Wish. Occasionally, Gengar is used with Jolteon for its ability to keep Blissey pressured in the absence of a more oppressive check like Metagross, and it makes the best use of its defensive abilities against Salamence on a team where a defensive backbone is lacking. Swampert is a staple in TSS style teams due to its immunity to sand, but Explosion Gengar can easily enable a Suicune sweep instead, where defensive Jirachi is the Rock resistance.</p> <p>Sometimes, this Gengar is paired with Dugtrio, where Gengar brings the special walls and status absorbers to such a low HP that Dugtrio can essentially remove them or it simply dents them with Explosion for Dugtrio to finish them. There are two ways to proceed from here; with a standard Tyranitar lineup, the remaining team can be outstalled by TSS due to the elimination of the status absorber. Alternatively, this Gengar can also be used on a team that drops Tyranitar in favor of a special threat, which has now been allowed free rein by the elimination of the special wall. Dugtrio can also potentially remove Pursuit Tyranitar or at least weaken it to a point where it is no longer a threat to Gengar.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Gengar is intended to be a mid- or late-game sweeper. With its vast coverage options, it can easily take out teams that have been weakened by Spikes with its super effective hits. The first move is the coverage for Skarmory. Thunderbolt is generally Gengar's strongest move, hitting most grounded targets neutrally, and it gives Gengar a way to hit Suicune, Starmie, Moltres, Charizard, and Gyarados really hard. The ability to threaten offensive Starmie with an almost assured OHKO under sand is notable, because it allows Gengar to switch in on an anticipated Rapid Spin and force Starmie out. Fire Punch is an alternative option that helps to take out metagame staples such as Metagross and Jirachi while also hitting Magneton and Heracross, which may wall Gengar in spite of their frailty. However, using Fire Punch comes at the cost of being walled by Fire-types and Gyarados.</p> <p>As Spikes only affects grounded Pokemon, Gengar needs Ice Punch to exert pressure on all non-grounded threats. Ice Punch OHKOes Salamence, allowing Gengar to pivot into the mixed variant safely and prevent the Dragon Dance variant from sweeping. Ice Punch 2HKOes Zapdos but usually simply threatens to OHKO it after taking a hit from Swampert, Suicune, Zapdos, or Metagross mid-game. Celebi can also be brought into 2HKO range should it take any residual damage. Offensive Gengar is therefore great at tearing up Zapdos + Celebi specially defensive cores. Ice Punch is also very important for putting pressure on Claydol, as it scores a clean 3HKO on 252 HP / 0 SpD Claydol; while Claydol is unable to 2HKO Gengar, catching it with Ice Punch on the switch guarantees that Claydol will not get the opportunity to force Gengar out and use Rapid Spin. Finally, Ice Punch also allows Gengar to OHKO Dugtrio and Flygon.</p> <p>A Grass-type move, most commonly Hidden Power Grass, is necessary to stop two of the tier's most common Pokemon, Swampert and Tyranitar, from completely walling Gengar. It comes very close to OHKOing Swampert and 2HKOing Tyranitar, and this again is where Spikes really helps. Pursuit Tyranitar is heavily pressured once it is put in 2HKO range because it loses if it tries to use Pursuit while Gengar boldly stays in to attack. Giga Drain can sometimes be used in place of Hidden Power Grass for healing Gengar.</p> <p>The last slot is usually dedicated to a move that helps Gengar maintain momentum. Explosion takes out Pokemon that Gengar is just short of KOing with a coverage move, notably Claydol, Zapdos, Celebi, and Starmie, and it does a chunk to Blissey and Snorlax. It also chips and ends the turn on Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Calm Mind Jirachi, denying their opportunity of setting up with the prospect of a follow-up KO. Hypnosis invalidates Gengar's checks, and many teams have only one of them. It can turn the tables on Claydol and Pursuit Tyranitar, whose teams are already weak to Spikes and Gengar. Landing Hypnosis can be a complete disaster for the opponent, but missing it can also be tragic, as offensive Gengar is very frail. Hypnosis is thus best used on an expected switch.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to minimize the amount of chip damage needed before Gengar starts wreaking havoc. Maximum Speed investment is never a bad idea on offensive Pokemon to force Speed ties, but technically, only 216 Speed EVs are needed to outspeed the next fastest Pokemon, Adamant Dugtrio. If that is chosen, investing the remaining EVs in HP gives Gengar better odds to survive defensive Swampert's Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump, defensive Starmie's Psychic, and Heracross's attacks in general, but one could also just put them into Attack for the extra sting on Explosion.</p> <p>Bring Gengar in on free turns after Spikes has been laid and when it can force a switch, especially when the opponent's team has been chipped across the board. The best situation either forces the opponent to sacrifice the Pokemon on the field or induces chip from Spikes and the first hit on the incoming Pokemon, putting the pivot into range of another coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes is pretty much mandatory with this set, as Gengar's lack of a STAB attack forbids it from hitting hard early-game, yet its versatile coverage becomes immensely more threatening when the opponent's team is uniformly chipped and unable to safely pivot around. Therefore, Cloyster and Skarmory are prime candidates as partners. Cloyster in particular deserves a mention because its offensive pace is better suited for offensive Gengar, and its Explosion or Surf can put a severe dent into Metagross or Tyranitar, bringing them further into Gengar's KO range. Naturally, fast phazers like Jolteon and Zapdos go well on offensive Spikes teams for racking up Spikes damage early-game on grounded bulky Pokemon. As offensive Gengar has no immediate answers to Blissey, Metagross could be an important pivot, especially if one is not using bulky physical Tyranitar. To set up for the sweep, Gengar appreciates other offensive partners that chip Zapdos mid-game such as offensive Swampert and Suicune. Finally, Gengar can also pave the way for an offensive Starmie, Jirachi, or Suicune to sweep, all of which take delight in bringing down the Pokemon that Gengar has already chipped or, in the case of Blissey and Snorlax, damaged with Explosion. Aerodactyl is also a great physically offensive partner, as desperate opponents are frequently very willing to trade away their bulky pivots to Aerodactyl, like Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, and Suicune, to remove Gengar.</p>"

        "Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is used mostly as a lead or early-game Pokemon on non-Spikes specially offensive teams to harass the opponent as much as possible with status moves before attempting to sacrifice itself to take out a special wall. If the set looks like a mess, it's because this Gengar's moves are truly versatile and, to some extent, team dependent. This Gengar works best in a position where it keeps its opponent guessing its moveset and eventually springs some surprises.</p> <p>Hypnosis fits nicely on the specially offensive teams. Due to their fast pace, it is highly likely that a Pokemon put to sleep never wakes up throughout the game, and even if a Natural Cure Pokemon is put to sleep, the opponent is still highly pressured to switch out to avoid Explosion. Regardless of the opponent's choice, sleep also provides an opportunity for a partner like Choice Band Metagross to get a free switch in. Will-O-Wisp threatens to burn Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi, allowing Gengar to more easily lure out the special walls. Note that nothing is stopping the use of Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp together; it is well and valid. Mean Look is a good option for teams that are highly reliant on Gengar to nail the Blissey trap, eliminating the risk of using Explosion on an irrelevant target.</p> <p>The second move is generally the move Gengar uses to force a trade.  Explosion is the most common choice; unlike Destiny Bond, it eliminates any uncertainty of getting into a follow-up Dugtrio's KO range and doesn't risk critical hits or secondary effects. Destiny Bond, however, allows Gengar to take out a range of offensive threats and act as a secondary measure to completely remove the special wall if Dugtrio has been taken out. It also removes Pursuit Tyranitar, giving rain users free rein. Again, nothing is stopping one from using both Explosion and Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Taunt has a variety of applications. It stops Skarmory from laying Spikes, and Skarmory is frequently willing to do so on the assumption that this Gengar in a lead position indicates a specially offensive team, against which Skarmory is not necessarily helpful and would gladly absorb Hypnosis. Furthermore, It prevents Refresh users from healing away the burn and keeps the momentum on one's side by preventing Blissey from firing off Thunder Wave. Having this momentum also allows Gengar to play more safely and time Explosion at a moment when the opponent is more highly pressured. Finally, Taunt also prevents the opponent from setting up and stops Suicune and Snorlax from using Rest.</p> <p>Ice Punch and Thunderbolt are coverage moves that hit most of the metagame neutrally. However, they are not mandatory, as this Gengar tends not to be used to sweep but create problems with its utility moves and force early-game exchanges. In fact, since the opponent is also usually going to assume that an unrevealed Gengar moveset is going to contain attacking moves, having a third utility move can sometimes be a nasty surprise. Focus Punch can catch Blissey and Pursuit Tyranitar off guard. It also encourages Blissey to stay in and recover, making the use of Mean Look and Explosion more reliable, and puts Tyranitar in range of Gengar's coverage move.</p> <p>There are multiple appropriate EV spreads for Gengar. The given spread allows it to put Bold Blissey into range of Dugtrio's Earthquake with Explosion while letting it survive Tyranitar's Pursuit in sand and outspeeding all base 100 Speed Pokemon like Zapdos and Salamence with Speed investment. Alternatively, one could go for an even more offensive spread of 96 Atk / 160 SpA / 252 Spe not just to do generally more damage but also to put most Snorlax into range of Dugtrio's Earthquake. Focus Punch sets might prefer the even more physically aggressive spread of 184 Atk / 124 SpA / 200 Spe to ensure that maximum HP Tyranitar gets KOed with the follow-up coverage move. One could go for the more physically defensive spread of 248 HP / 52 Atk / 112 SpD / 96 Spe with a Timid nature for an almost similar benchmark on Blissey, except this set is only fast enough to outspeed Timid Moltres. If one is willing to accept the small probability of a maximum HP Blissey surviving both Dugtrio and Gengar or is using Destiny Bond instead of Explosion, then using a Timid nature with any of the EV spreads in the defensive set is also fine.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dugtrio is the most common partner to this Gengar. It follows up after Gengar's Explosion to KO special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, Celebi, and Jirachi while also removing Pursuit Tyranitar for Gengar, or together with Gengar, for the sake of setting up rain. This combination opens the door for a whole host of special threats, including offensive Calm Mind users like Suicune, Celebi, Jirachi, and Raikou and rain users like Kingdra and Ludicolo. Apart from providing special support, Gengar's Hypnosis also allows hard-hitting physical threats like Heracross and Choice Band Metagross to come in for free.</p>"

        "Perish Trap": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set intends to trap special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi through the surprise use of Mean Look + Perish Song. The generic idea is to trap the wall with Mean Look, use Perish Song, wait it out or switch to Dugtrio to continue the trap, and then switch out for the KO. If Gengar is kept around, one can even use Perish Song a second time as Gengar is KOed and use Substitute Dugtrio for a second follow-up KO.</p> <p>Taunt prevents the opponent from phazing or using status moves and should be used with Destiny Bond to force the opponent into using an attacking move. Substitute tends to be used with Protect to retain as much HP as possible while the Perish Song counter is running. Destiny Bond is supposed to be used as a last resort when Gengar has taken out something and lacks the HP for another trap.  Hypnosis is a high-risk high-reward option that has general utility; it can also turn the tides against a check if it hits, but it can lead to Gengar being KOed if it misses.</p> <p>The EVs are tailored to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon like Timid Zapdos and Jolly Choice Band Salamence with maximum Speed investment in order to nail them with Taunt and Destiny Bond, while maximum HP investment helps to survive attacks like defensive Celebi's Psychic and minimize damage from Blissey's Ice Beam, Snorlax's Shadow Ball, and Heracross's Rock Slide. Gengar's EVs are versatile here. One could go for a spread that guarantees surviving Pursuit from Tyranitar under sand so that Destiny Bond is not ruined by sand at the expense of physical bulk that is helpful in taking Snorlax's Shadow Ball or Speed. A spread that satisfies the former condition is 168 HP / 164 SpD / 176 Spe, while one that provides for the latter is 248 HP / 44 Def / 112 SpD / 104 Spe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Substitute Dugtrio is an important partner to this Gengar, as Substitute allows Dugtrio to take over from Gengar in extending trap turns for Perish Song to take effect. Note that Dugtrio can still carry Choice Band and replace Rock Slide with Substitute, since everything Dugtrio traps is hit hard by its other moves. Offensive Calm Mind users like Suicune, Celebi, Jirachi, and Raikou as well as rain users like Kingdra and Ludicolo all benefit from the removal of special walls.</p>"

This can be used in tandem with a partner's attack like Thunderbolt from Zapdos and Raikou or Hydro Pump from Starmie to remove Metagross before it gets a chance to move.</li> <li>Explosion is a very high risk but high reward option, as even with Gengar's low attack stat, it does well over 75% to most neutral targets.

However, these moves either have limited uses or only work on specific team setups.</li> <li>As a lead, it's recommended to pair Gengar with teammates like Metagross and Swampert that deter Tyranitar from freely using Dragon Dance.

      "overview": "<p>When it comes to fast Electric-types, Electrode has no issues standing out. Its astonishing base 140 Speed makes it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier by quite some margin. With its incredible Speed, usable Special Attack, and Explosion, it makes for a good revenge killer and suicide wallbreaker on offensive teams. Electrode can reliably revenge kill Scyther, which other Electric-types like Manectric and Electabuzz can only Speed tie with. It also pairs well with Electric-types, though, as they share a lot of checks that Electrode can lure in and destroy with Explosion. However, Electrode's offensive stats leave something to be desired when comparing it to Electabuzz and Manectric, and although its Explosion hits hard, it won't KO bulkier Pokemon without some prior damage. It also has less than stellar bulk, so it won't withstand most super effective hits, and even strong neutral hits like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge will KO it without much prior damage.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is an option over Substitute on some teams to easily KO Wish Kangaskhan with Explosion. Hidden Power Grass hits Lanturn without resorting to Explosion, but the downsides of dropping Hidden Power Ice are generally not worth it. Thunder Wave could be used on teams that appreciate faster Pokemon being slowed down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Although weakened Kangaskhan can be KOed by Explosion, offensive versions can OHKO Electrode back with ease. Rest means it might be able to switch out and heal any damage later, undoing Electrode's hard work. It also can potentially switch out or use Protect on a predicted Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types and Grass-types</strong>: Volt Absorb Lanturn renders Hidden Power Ice Electrode useless and may run Protect to block Explosion or Rest to handle Toxic. Ampharos cannot deal much damage to Electrode at once but generally outlasts it with its superior bulk and power. Cradily completely sits on Electrode unless it runs Toxic, as it is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice at best. Vileplume is also an effective counter, as it resists Thunderbolt and isn't 2HKOed by unboosted Hidden Power Ice. However, all of these Pokemon but Cradily fall to Explosion with enough chip damage.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute gives Electrode a much needed shield from hard hitters, scouts for switch-ins when forcing foes out, and helps activate Petaya Berry or Liechi Berry. Explosion leaves a serious dent in most foes despite Electrode's horrible Attack. This is helped because Electrode's checks do not resist Normal; the main Pokemon that does, Omastar, wants nothing to do with Thunderbolt, and Ghost-types in Misdreavus and Banette are fairly uncommon and don't enjoy Thunderbolt either. Hidden Power Ice lets it OHKO Gligar and push damage on Vileplume so Explosion KOes. Toxic can cripple Cradily, which otherwise walls Electrode.</p> <p>As for its item, a pinch Berry is the most common choice. Petaya Berry is generally the best choice for its Special Attack boost, but Liechi Berry can be useful for instantly taking down a bulkier Explosion target like Kangaskhan, Vileplume, Ampharos, or the uncommon Hypno. Leftovers is another option, especially if Electrode is running Toxic, as it gives it longevity and potentially more Substitute uses. Magnet is useful if Electrode is running a Speed-boosting nature to give it a much needed damage boost to Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Because its Speed is so high, Electrode generally doesn't need a lot of Speed EVs unless you want it to outrun a specific boosted target, such as Gorebyss in rain or Salac Berry-boosted base 50s, 55s, or 60s like Banette. Not requiring a lot of Speed EVs means that it can invest in Special Attack, Attack, and even bulk at the same time. The spread shown above puts Electrode at 340 Speed with a neutral nature, letting it outrun base 105s like Scyther, Manectric, and Electabuzz. The spread also makes Substitute take exactly 25% of Electrode's health, allowing for the quickest activation of its pinch Berry. If not using one, this benchmark is unnecessary. 116 Defense EVs let Electrode take maximum Attack Kangaskhan's Earthquake. If you are not using any HP investment, 128 EVs will do the same. The other EVs are dumped into Attack for Explosion. An alternative spread is 100 Atk / 192 SpA / 216 Spe with a Naive nature, which revenge kills Swift Swim Gorebyss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Electrode needs help to break through bulkier Pokemon, Spikes is a natural fit with it. Omastar and Glalie make for good Spikes users, since the former can switch into Kangaskhan and fit on almost any team, and the latter is great at getting Spikes up early on for Electrode to take advantage of. Electrode makes a great partner for a second Electric-type like Manectric or Electabuzz, which greatly appreciates Electrode baiting in and using Explosion on shared counters, and they too appreciate Spikes support. Rain Dance Omastar, Scyther, and Gorebyss also appreciate Electrode's ability to lure in and destroy the likes of Ampharos, Vileplume, and Kangaskhan.</p>"

Hidden Power Ground is an option that can go in place of Hidden Power Flying in order to hit Rock-types like Corsola, Onix, and Rhyhorn as well as Magnemite for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass and Giga Drain are two options Ariados can utilize to patch up teams weak to Corsola and hit other Bug- and Poison-resistant Pokemon like Onix and Rhyhorn for 4x supereffective damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: While Abra is OHKOed by Signal Beam, without being Agility boosted, Ariados is a sitting duck in front of Abra.

Nosepass and Onix impede Ariados's progress thanks to their bulk, as unless Liechi Berry has activated and Ariados is in Swarm range, Signal Beam will be very unthreatening.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta and Quilava both threaten to OHKO Ariados and have access to Quick Attack to pick off weakened ones.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Delibird, Doduo, and Tropius threaten Ariados with STAB Flying-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Without Psychic, Poison-types like opposing Ariados, Dustox, Gloom, and Koffing are massive thorns in Ariados's side.

        "Defensive Pivot": {
          "description": "<p>Ariados distinguishes itself as the best defensive pivot available in the tier. Thanks to its great defensive typing and superb stats for the tier, Ariados is a staple for many teams, checking physical attackers such as Meditite, Mightyena, and Beedrill. Psychic threatens Poison-types such as Beedrill, Koffing, and opposing Ariados. Sludge Bomb hits most Pokemon hard with neutral damage, and Poison-resistant Pokemon such as Rhyhorn and Onix dislike being poisoned by it. Toxic threatens bulky Pokemon such as Castform and Noctowl that hate status on the switch in. Baton Pass allows frail offensive Pokemon such as Meditite, Abra, and Elekid to find entry more commonly due to Ariados's low Speed. Protect gives Ariados extra Leftovers recovery and allows it to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Aipom and Meditite. Alternatively, Signal Beam pressures Mightyena more immediately. Giga Drain threatens Rock-types such as Rhyhorn, Corsola, and Onix on the switch in while also giving Ariados some recovery. A Relaxed nature makes Ariados more offensively threatening as a mixed attacker, while 20 Speed IVs are used in order to underspeed Pokemon like Koffing, keeping frail teammates like Abra safer. Ariados can also lower its Speed IVs to 0 to pivot more slowly than opposing pivot Ariados or at least Speed tie with them.</p> <p>Ariados's flexibility allows it to fit on offense and balance teams alike, as both playstyles appreciate a slow pivot to support Pokemon that struggle to find entry. Frail offensive Pokemon such as Ponyta, Meditite, Abra, and Elekid benefit from the addition of a pivot like Ariados giving them more opportunities to come in safely to wallbreak. Ponyta notably checks Fire-types such as Quilava and Magby, which threaten Ariados. Abra threatens to OHKO Ariados, so Pokemon such as Mightyena and Drowzee are good partners to help check Abra. Clamperl and Cubone are amazing teammates, as they appreciate Ariados bringing them in to break teams and can also punish Rock- and Fire-type switch-ins into Ariados. Both also appreciate Ariados checking Gloom. Other Pokemon that punish these switch-ins, such as Seaking, Wartortle, and Cubone, are also good partners for Ariados. Ariados lacks special bulk, so special walls such as Noctowl, Drowzee, and Porygon can accommodate this weakness. Delcatty can make a great partner to cover Ariados's mediocre special bulk while forming a Baton Pass core on offensive teams. Ariados is walled by Corsola, as Giga Drain is unable to 2HKO it, and used as setup fodder. Teammates such as Clamperl and Gloom are great to punish Corsola trying to set up.</p>"

        "Agility": {
          "description": "<p>Ariados's access to Agility, a high Attack stat, and Swarm makes it a scary mid- or late-game sweeper. Ariados functions similarly to Beedrill, another Agility sweeper, but it offers better bulk, greater initial power in Signal Beam, and access to alternative Hidden Power options besides Hidden Power Bug. Agility allows Ariados to beat would-be faster foes like Abra, Anorith, Ponyta, and Quilava. Sludge Bomb is Ariados's strongest STAB move, threatening Fire-types, Tropius, and Noctowl. Signal Beam hits like a truck when Swarm is active, when it can 2HKO defensive options like Rhyhorn, Delcatty, and Porygon and OHKO threats like Anorith and Mightyena. Hidden Power Flying hits other Bug- and Grass-types such as opposing Ariados, Dustox, Gloom, and Volbeat for big damage. Substitute is vital if opting for Liechi Berry, as it enables Ariados to reliably activate its Liechi Berry, and it additionally blocks status and Intimidate and protects it from priority attackers. Psychic is another strong alternative to consider, as it allows Ariados to threaten Koffing. Leftovers is preferred for the recovery it provides and for allowing Ariados to set up Substitute multiple times. Liechi Berry can be an excellent tool for more offensive teams thanks to its sweeping potential by enabling Ariados to 2HKO common Bug-resistant foes like Corsola and Rhyhorn with Signal Beam, and it has great synergy with Swarm and Substitute. The EV spread allows Ariados to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after using Agility. The rest of Ariados's EVs are funneled into its bulk, with the HP to let it activate its Liechi Berry at 25% health.</p> <p>Ariados fits well on balance and offensive teams that could use a hard-hitting bulky attacker that defensively answers Gloom and Tropius. With a Liechi Berry, Ariados can even function as a wincon on offense and hyper offense. Ariados appreciates special attackers like Abra, Clamperl, Flaaffy, and Quilava, as they can deal with its checks, such as Koffing, Corsola, and defensive Ariados. When not behind a Substitute, Ariados is defenseless in the face of Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava, which makes bulky Water-types like Seaking and Wartortle very valuable allies. While Doduo can't switch in safely against Ariados due to its fragility and tendency to wear itself down with recoil damage, having a switch-in to it is a great option to preserve Ariados's HP when it's not Agility boosted or behind Substitute. For this reason, physically bulky Rock-types like Corsola, Onix, and Rhyhorn can make for great partners for Ariados. Ariados's Rock weakness demands strong defensive checks to Rock-types, which gives the aforementioned physically defensive Pokemon great defensive value when paired with Ariados. Similarly, Mightyena can serve to soften the blows from physical attackers with Intimidate, and it can also combat Abra and other Psychic-types. Ariados's ability to break down special walls opens the door to many strong special attackers like Abra and Quilava, since they get stopped in their tracks by Delcatty, Drowzee, and Noctowl. In that same vein, Ariados is strong against Mightyena, which can open the door to physical and mixed attackers like Aipom and Ponyta that prefer not being debuffed by Intimidate.</p>"

Yes, it is a weak Pokemon, but use it right and it can make quite a positive difference to your team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is something else that can be passed (Double Team can also be passed if evasion moves are allowed). Giga Drain can be used for Golem, Sandslash, and the other Pokemon that resist its Sludge Bomb. Ariados can also Toxic and trap the opponent, although it's a strategy that generally doesn't work. Thief and Hyper Beam are your standard suicide moves, really, and both work well enough on this Pokemon.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Well, if you're going with the physical sweeper set, you will want to boost that Attack a lot. However, put a fair bit into that HP as well, so it can actually Baton Pass something as well. If you are using it primarily to Baton Pass, its defenses should be your area of focus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Both defenses are horrible, and none of its attacks (even Giga Drain) will do serious damage to Golem, Sandslash, and other hard skinned Pokemon resistant to both STAB attacks (who usually hold Rock Slide anyway.) Also be wary of fast sweepers like Fearow, Mr. Mime, and friends. Whether you have Spider Webbed it or not, you will need to get Ariados out of there. Steel-types are immune to Sludge Bomb and resistant to Signal Beam, so they are also excellent counters, particularly those with Roar or Whirlwind in case Ariados gets a Spider Web or a few boosts.</p>",

A 10% chance of confusion is always handy as well.</p> <p>Start off the battle with either Spider Web or Agility (Agility is generally better), and start attacking. When Ariados is close to fainting, you can Baton Pass the Speed or trap onto another Pokemon to benefit from. It's simple, and quite effective; just watch out for its weaknesses, like its old buddy Golem.</p> <p>Ariados also works well enough primarily as a Baton Passer.

Ice Beam can be used to for stuff like Claydol and Salamence, I suppose, but most everything else, such as Grass-types, will be hit harder by Sludge Bomb. Counter can be used instead of Destiny Bond, though most stuff KOs Qwilfish and Destiny Bond tends to be a much better move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're using a mixed set, you should lower his Defense (use Hasty or Lonely nature), especially if you're using Destiny Bond, as that would guarantee that most things kill you, but still lets you switch on Walrein, Blastoise, and other Water-types.

Big brother Tentacruel can easily get set up on Qwilfish, and anything that can take a Sludge Bomb and deal some good damage is a pretty good deterrent as well. Most Rapid Spinners tend to have more than enough defense to take you on, so don't get overzealous with the Spikes. Take what you can get.

A Choice Band, therefore, suits the style of play Qwilfish generally needs to survive. Hydro Pump hits Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross, and does something to Groudon, but Ice Beam will do more to Groudon and Rayquaza. Hydro Pump is probably going to be the more useful move, as Rayquaza is very rare, especially compared to Forretress, and Hydro Pump is not much weaker vs. Groudon than Ice Beam.

  "Magcargo": {
    "pu": {"sets": {"Offensive Tank": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Magcargo really is a mixed bag of pros and cons. It sports a very bad array of weaknesses to Fighting-, Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, but a Rock weakness is a nice trade for a Grass neutrality overall compared to the other Rock-types in the tier. On top of that, Magcargo also has a resistance to Ice, which, combined with a decent Special Defense stat, really sets it apart from the other Rock-types in the tier. Unfortunately, its Attack stat is abysmal, meaning it can't really make use of its Rock STAB or access to Self-Destruct to the fullest. That said, its Special Attack is above average, and its STAB Fire Blast will hurt a lot of the tier. It's also extremely slow, even being outsped by the other Rock-types in the tier, therefore making it easy to revenge kill. Magcargo shines on teams that can make use of its mixed defenses and ability Flame Body to wall special attackers like Flareon and physical Normal-types like Pidgeot and Raticate; just be mindful of its snail's pace when using it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focusing on Magcargo's Special Attack and making it into a tank is an option, but Torkoal and Flareon are typically better suited for this role, due to the former's higher overall bulk and the latter's higher Speed. Hidden Power Electric is another move option on the above set, as it keeps the super effective hit on Water-types and trades the ability to thrash Whiscash for the ability to smack around Pelipper. Overheat can be used as a STAB move, as Magcargo will be switching in and out often enough anyway. Magcargo also has access to both Acid Armor and Amnesia, though Reflect and Light Screen will typically be better in the long run. Finally, Magcargo's Rock STAB can be used through Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock, but without heavy Attack EV investment, it won't be very useful except for a better hit on Kecleon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types, particularly RestTalk users like Relicanth, Whiscash, and Dewgong, are the absolute best switch-ins to Magcargo, as they resist its STAB attacks and can shrug off status easily, and Relicanth even resists Self-Destruct. Offensive Water-types such as Seadra and Huntail will easily outspeed and OHKO Magcargo with Surf, but they need to be mindful of status and Self-Destruct. Other Rock-types, such as Sudowoodo and Graveler, resist Fire Blast and Self-Destruct and will easily OHKO Magcargo with Earthquake, but they will be whittled down by Toxic over time if they're not careful. Piloswine can't switch into Fire Blast or Flamethrower safely, but it will also easily OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p>Hitmonchan will do a ton of damage with either its STAB moves or Earthquake, but it will not enjoy taking anything Magcargo throws at it in return and definitely will not like being burned by Flame Body. Guts users, namely Machoke and Raticate, will enjoy being hit with status to give a boost to their attacks, but they will take a lot of damage from Fire Blast. Finally, anything else with Earthquake or Hidden Power Ground, such as Vigoroth or Pidgeot, will be able to check Magcargo and threaten an OHKO or near-OHKO.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Specially Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Even with max Defense EV investment Magcargo still crumbles to any Fighting- and Ground-type attack, and without any Defense investment Magcargo still walls most Normal- and Flying-type attacks, meaning the logical choice is to focus on its average Special Defense to allow it to wall special attackers like Flareon and tank attacks from Chimecho much better. Flamethrower and Fire Blast are both decent STAB moves that separate it from the other Rock-types in the tier, targeting the foes that it normally walls on their generally lower Special Defense. Toxic spreads status and is Magcargo's best way of crippling the bulky Water-types that are sure to switch into it. RestTalk is recommended on this set to give Magcargo as much longevity as possible and allow it to absorb Sleep Powders and other status from the Grass-types it easily walls. When taking this route, pairing Magcargo with a Heal Bell user like Chimecho would be wise to wake it quickly. Toxic can be replaced with Yawn and pairs well with Magcargo's defensive nature by forcing a switch and giving Magcargo's team some momentum.</p> <p>Sassy is the chosen nature to not lower the power of Self-Destruct or Flamethrower, and the slightly lower Speed stat is not an issue due to Magcargo's already snail's pace. A mixed defensive EV spread is doable; a spread of 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, with the Defense investment preventing the 2HKO from a +2 Adamant Mawile's Hidden Power Steel while still allowing Magcargo to avoid the 2HKO from 252 SpA Modest Chimecho's Psychic. Generally, however, the additional Special Defense is preferred to allow Magcargo to beat Plusle one-on-one, and Magcargo OHKOes Mawile with Fire Blast anyway (though not with Flamethrower).</p> <p>Magcargo surprisingly has a number of viable move options not listed above that can be tailored to meet the needs of your team. If running RestTalk doesn't suit your taste, Protect pairs best with Toxic to allow for residual damage buildup and additional Leftovers recovery, as well as allowing Magcargo to scout Choice Band attackers' attacks. That said, Protect's utility can be forgone in favor of additional coverage from Hidden Power Grass, which gives Magcargo some modicum of defense against the other Rock-types in the tier beyond status and will deal a ton of damage to the likes of Whiscash. Self-Destruct is pretty weak compared to the other boom attacks in the tier due to Magcargo's paltry Attack stat, but it's still a good way of crippling opposing Pokemon and allowing Magcargo to keep momentum for its team and prevent Pokemon like Huntail from freely setting up on it; obviously, this should only be run when not using RestTalk. Light Screen and Reflect are both available, with Reflect notably allowing Magcargo to avoid the OHKO from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Earthquake 75% of the time. Light Screen may be more handy overall, though, as with max Special Defense investment and behind a Light Screen, Magcargo is only 3HKOed by defensive Dewgong's Surf. Hidden Power Water can be used over Hidden Power Grass, which trades the ability to batter Whiscash and Relicanth for the ability to threaten other offensive Fire-types like Charmeleon. Both Toxic and Yawn can be used on the set at the same time, allowing Magcargo to literally pick its poison for the enemy between those two moves and its ability, Flame Body; however, doing so can leave Magcargo completely helpless against Substitute users.</p> <p>Spikes support is very effective with this set due to the status and switches it forces, and Roselia has fantastic type synergy with Magcargo, though using both will create a large Ground-type weakness that can be hard to fill. Still, a switch-in to Ground-, Fighting-, and Rock-type attacks is needed when using Magcargo, making physically defensive Swalot, Pelipper, and Whiscash good teammates. Water-types are particularly dangerous to the success of this set, making defensive Bellossom and Kecleon good teammates as well. Finally, offensive Pokemon that appreciate Magcargo's ability to wall both Fire- and Flying-types should be used with it, examples including Tangela, Piloswine, and Venomoth.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Corsola has cemented itself as a metagame defining threat thanks to its excellent defensive typing and exceptional bulk. This, combined with its access to reliable recovery and Calm Mind, makes it one of the most potent setup sweepers. Calm Mind allows Corsola to comfortably set up against the variety of Pokemon that struggle to 2HKO it, such as Porygon, Mightyena, and Choice-locked Normal-types like Doduo and Aipom. With two Calm Mind boosts, Corsola can reliably avoid being 2HKOed by its most common offensive checks, Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Quilava, notably also surviving super effective hits like Hidden Power Grass. Recover provides Corsola with a reliable form of recovery, which helps increase the number of setup opportunities available. Refresh prevents it from being forced out by status users such as Porygon, Koffing, and Castform, drastically increasing its setup opportunities and allowing for almost riskless Calm Mind uses. Alternatively, Ice Beam is an option to threaten Tropius and specially defensive Gloom, two of Corsola's biggest defensive answers. Natural Cure lets Corsola heal off status conditions; while somewhat redundant alongside Refresh, it is still Corsola's most useful ability on this set.</p> <p>Corsola excels on balance and bulkier teams that appreciate its defensive typing and setup capabilities. Its premier partner Gloom excels on these kinds of teams. These two make for perfect partners, as Gloom can check Flaaffy, Chinchou, and opposing Corsola and helps with Corsola's susceptibility to being taken advantage of by weather users like opposing Gloom and Seaking. In return, Corsola can soak up physical attacks and threaten to set up on Pokemon that threaten Gloom such as Doduo and physical Seaking. Special walls like Porygon, Drowzee, and Delcatty pair well with Corsola, as they can wall Flaaffy and Quilava. Drowzee is worth mentioning because Corsola can absorb status for it, while Drowzee can pass a Wish to Corsola if it gets too weakened to use Recover. Corsola pairs well with physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Seaking, Volbeat, and Doduo, as they can remove Gloom and other specially defensive checks. Because Corsola can find multiple setup opportunities throughout a game, secondary sweepers and cleaners like Anorith and Beedrill make good teammates. Corsola can wall faster revenge killers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Volbeat or set up mid-game and remove potential checks to Beedrill and Anorith.</p>"

Suicune will neutralize him, anything that can take a hit and OHKO or 2HKO him works; lots of stuff counters him. Just run when you know you're beat.</p>",

His Special Attack is better than his Attack, so use his best STAB move, Surf, and Ice Beam for Flying- and Dragon-types, then Toxic to help wear things down. Use Psychic if you want more of a pure sweeping set or Calm Mind if you think you can pull it off. Leftovers because Natural Cure takes care of status recovery. Switch out at the sight of Sceptile and Zapdos etc., but try and hit with an Ice Beam on the switch in.</p>"},
        "Mirror Coat": {"description": "<p>Weird set, but here's how it works: Reflect will bring in a Special Attacker. Light Screen or Amnesia on the switch, then Mirror Coat the subsequent attack and get the hell out of there. Focus Band to try and survive a Grass-type attack and Mirror Coat it back. Recover is there to get your HP back when you find a safe time to switch in. Toxic because once they know what you're up to, all this can do is pseudo-pass. Not too bad of a set, and it takes advantage of Corsola's good defenses.</p>"},

Explosion is powerful but extremely risky with Hustle, so you may want to go with Earthquake. Hidden Power Fighting is really just for Tyranitar, though it hits Blissey harder than anything but a Rock Blast with 4 or 5 hits. Psychic for Weezing, Surf for Skarmory, standard CB fare. Always use Hustle with this for the extra pop, though I will admit a Natural Curing CBer is interesting. Too bad he doesn't have the Attack to back it up.</p>"},

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect works well alongside Pressure to quickly stall out Blissey's PP. Thunder Wave is viable because paralysis is always nice, but it isn't the best choice for Raikou. With Psych Up, Raikou can copy Calm Mind boosts from Suicune. Crunch can be used over Hidden Power Ice or Grass for better all-around neutral coverage and to hit Celebi a little harder, but this usually just renders Raikou unable to KO both Swampert and Flygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio has difficulties switching in, but it can trap and OHKO Raikou. Furthermore, with 44 Special Defense EVs or 48 with Hidden Power Bug, Dugtrio can survive a super effective Hidden Power from Timid Raikou, then switch into Thunderbolt and not be KOed the next turn when running Adamant, while Jolly Dugtrio can safely switch into any of Timid Raikou's attacks and proceed to OHKO it with Earthquake. Of course, if there are Spikes on Dugtrio's side of the field, it will have a bit more trouble.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Snorlax can take repeated hits from Raikou and KO it with ease. With Psych Up or Seismic Toss, Regice beats non-Rest Raikou one-on-one by virtue of its high Special Defense. If Regice lacks those two moves, however, Raikou can set up with Calm Mind to the point where its Substitute is unbreakable. Celebi with Perish Song can easily force out Raikou and can set up Calm Mind alongside it while taking very little from its common attacks. Flygon and Venusaur with physical moves, such as Sludge Bomb, can beat Hidden Power Grass Raikou variants.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Electric-immune Foes</strong>: Swampert is OHKOed by +1 Hidden Power Grass and 2HKOed otherwise, but it can switch into Thunderbolt and OHKO Raikou with Earthquake, and it easily beats the less common Hidden Power Ice variants. Steelix and Camerupt are immune to Thunderbolt, take neutral damage from both Hidden Power Ice and Grass, and can hit Raikou back with STAB Earthquake. Claydol has a high Special Defense stat, +1 Timid Raikou 2HKOes it. With Roar or Thunder Wave, Jolteon matches up well against Raikou.</p>",

Substitute is the usual option, allowing Raikou to set up in the face of special attackers that can't break its Substitute. It also blocks status and provides a buffer against critical hits. Roar is a decent option as well though, allowing Raikou to beat any Calm Mind user, scout, and rack up Spikes damage on its most common counters: Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi. Hidden Power Grass gives Raikou an edge against Swampert, while Hidden Power Ice deals with the less common Flygon and hits Celebi for good damage.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment gives Raikou the jump on Adamant Aerodactyl and lets Raikou, at worst, Speed tie opposing Raikou and Starmie. When using Roar, being able to phaze opposing Raikou first can be devastating.</p> <p>A Modest nature is a viable alternative to Timid, as it still outspeeds maximum Speed base 100 Pokemon and only loses out to Adamant Dugtrio, Adamant Aerodactyl, Gengar, and +1 Tyranitar. A major selling point is that Modest Raikou has a 56% chance to OHKO standard Dugtrio, something Timid sets fail to ever accomplish. Reflect is an option in the last slot, boosting up Raikou's defenses in order to take on Pokemon like Snorlax and Dugtrio more efficiently.

This Raikou acts as a superb special wall and attacker, but it is not able to force itself through Ground-types without assistance.</p> <p>This set should run 136 Speed EVs for neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. 252 HP EVs grant maximum bulk; the remaining EVs are put in Special Attack for a bit more punch.</p>"

  "Entei": {

Additionally, he's nothing special; Suicune and Jirachi are better Substitute + Calm Mind users, and Blaziken and Houndoom are better Fire-types in standard play. Nonetheless, Entei is less fragile than the latter two and can get past Blissey in an unorthodox and sometimes unexpected way.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a decent move on Fire-types, as Water-types generally hate being poisoned, as do Salamence, Tyranitar, and Gyarados. Reflect supports your team against Snorlax and other physical threats. Roar is iffy on a Pokemon with few good resistances and such low Special Defense; nevertheless, it might be able to mess up Celebi that carry a Grass move instead of Psychic. Psych Up lets Entei steal Calm Mind boosts from others, but the most common Calm Mind user, Suicune, isn't going to care much. It will be priceless if used on a Regice that stole Calm Mind boosts from another of your Pokemon though, and it always works on Celebi.</p> <p>Entei learns several physical filler moves, such as Body Slam, and has a decent Attack stat as well. However, he should generally stick to special attacking because of his special STAB and access to Calm Mind. You could try a novelty Leer + Hidden Power Fighting set to take down Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Blissey, but don't expect too much of it--even Arcanine will do it better with Howl.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>First of all, Water-types: Suicune and Milotic don't take much damage from Fire-attacks and can hit back with a STAB super effective Surf, while Swampert can do the same with Earthquake. However, Swampert has to beware of Hidden Power Grass, which OHKOes him after a Calm Mind. Other, lesser used Waters will do fine, but these three are the most common.</p> <p>In addition, Entei has a lot of trouble with Dragon Dance users. Tyranitar, Salamence, and Gyarados all resist Fire and can hit him hard with Earthquake--or, in Tyranitar's case, Rock Slide. None of these Pokemon are very fond of Toxic though. Finally, Blissey and Snorlax are decent counters. Blissey can wall the Sunnybeam set and sometimes even the SubCM one, while Snorlax has Thick Fat and can hurt Entei with STAB Normal moves or Earthquake.</p>",
      "sets": {

Be sure to keep a Substitute up if possible to protect Entei from status and Dugtrio.</p> <p>Entei should aim to hit 404 HP, as this lets his Substitutes survive Seismic Toss and Night Shade. With 285 Speed, he beats Medicham, while 296 is enough for all Heracross. 300 lets him outrun Salamence and other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, and maximum Speed is viable too.</p>"},

Sunny Day lowers the power of Water-type moves while boosting Entei's Fire attacks, and also removes Solar Beam's charge turn. Entei's Special Attack stat is rather low though, so Milotic and Suicune might still be able to stall him out. Calm Mind can help with that, but Hidden Power Ice messes up Salamence and Flygon very nicely. Beware of Tyranitar switching into a Solar Beam, however, as Entei will be forced to stay in and be crushed by Tyranitar's Rock Slide. This moveset is probably better done by Houndoom, who is slightly slower, but has more Special Attack.</p> <p>401 HP lets Entei survive five Seismic Tosses or Night Shades with Leftovers intact; the magic Speed numbers to consider are as listed on the previous set.</p>"}
      }
    }
  },
  "Suicune": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Suicune's viability in ADV OU comes from its status as a bulky Water-type with Calm Mind, allowing it to check some of the tier's most dangerous physical threats while providing an offensive presence that other bulky Water-types lack. Defensively, Suicune's defenses outstrip Milotic's and Swampert's, giving it the heft to shrug off physical heavy hits and surprise special attacks from the tier's primary threats, Tyranitar, Salamence, and Metagross. Rest further bolsters its defensive prowess and boosting potential by giving it total recovery, making it much harder to stop. Combine that with Pressure, and Suicune's ability to PP stall special walls makes it a ticking time bomb. Offensively, Suicune's Calm Mind and natural bulk allow it to both dish out tons of damage and act as an emergency check to physical threats. Its offensive prowess is bolstered by its ability to run a variety of moves to work past potential counters, such as Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, Substitute, Roar, and Toxic. Suicune's versatility lies not only in its moves but also in its EVs, where modifications change the way Suicune is played altogether; RestTalk Suicune with offensive EVs becomes a potent early-game wallbreaker unlike defensive Rest Suicune's typical use as a late-game sweeper, while offensive Substitute sets with maximum HP are able to completely turn the tides against Blissey.</p> <p>Suicune's most pressing flaw is its grounded status and pure Water typing, which render it vulnerable to Spikes and sand damage. Suicune's lack of recovery outside of Rest is also an issue—Suicune lacking Rest will be even more vulnerable to being worn down and will struggle to push through special walls like Blissey, but with Rest comes the danger that Suicune will be used as setup fodder by Spikes users and other sweepers while asleep. Suicune struggles to set up and sweep against teams containing an Electric-type or Celebi, the former of which threaten it with powerful STAB moves, while the latter resists its primary attack in Surf and can beat it with Leech Seed, Calm Mind, or the rare Perish Song to deny it safe setup and guarantee its KO if it's the last Pokemon standing. Suicune is also vulnerable to attackers wielding Self-Destruct or Explosion such as Metagross, Snorlax, Cloyster, and Gengar, which can KO it outright or weaken it to the point of uselessness. Suicune's lack of a resistance to Rock like Swampert or a recovery move without drawbacks like Milotic renders it vulnerable to being taken down by flinches in late-game scenarios against Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Choice Band Aerodactyl.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect is an option that bolsters Suicune's already absurd physical bulk while providing team support; for example, it prevents Celebi from getting trapped by Dugtrio as easily. It is a viable option on Rest Suicune for weakening Explosion, especially while sleeping, and helps Suicune take down Snorlax. It also can be used on Substitute Suicune, where it helps to prevent Snorlax from breaking Substitute. Of course, dropping Roar or Ice Beam coverage requires the rest of the team to deal with opposing Suicune, Celebi, and Salamence.</p> <p>Mirror Coat can be used as a lure to Electric-types, as Suicune's natural bulk allows it to take Zapdos's Thunderbolt and return the damage. The most convincing way to execute this tactic is using Calm Mind as Zapdos switches in. However, this can backfire if Zapdos uses a status-inducing move expecting a switch or to compensate for it running lower Speed than Suicune.</p> <p>Substitute + Rest has several uses. First, as Blissey must use Seismic Toss twice to break Suicune's Substitute, Suicune is at full HP on the first turn of sleep, providing increased longevity. Second, Substitute is a safe play that guards against phazers that attempt to come in on the predicted Rest turn to restrict Suicune to burning only one turn of sleep. Third, Substitute guards Suicune against critical hits and getting trapped by Dugtrio, and Explosion while sleeping. Fourth, Substitute helps Rest Suicune PP stall Blissey. However, Substitute ultimately comes at the expense of Roar, which many Suicune teams need to avoid being set up on.</p> <p>Rain Dance can be used even on non-Substitute sets, increasing Suicune's longevity and power while supporting teammates. Protect can be used for Leftovers recovery outside of sand and to play around Explosion from threats like Metagross, Snorlax, and Gengar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune's versatility makes it difficult to pinpoint blanket checks and counters. How one plays against Suicune is highly dependent on its set and the game scenario.</p> <p>Defensive Suicune is usually only dangerous when it gets several boosts and survives using Rest with a turn to spare. Offensive teams can frequently defeat Suicune by attacking, especially with sand and Spikes, such that Suicune does not have time to boost nor escape from using Rest constantly. Even sacrificing a Pokemon like Dragon Dance Tyranitar to bring Suicune down to low HP can frequently be enough to render Suicune useless. Defensive teams can wall Suicune, force it to use Rest, and phaze it out while attempting to set Spikes to wear Suicune down. In the late-game, a Taunt Gengar or Explosion user with a strong follow-up Pokemon like Dugtrio or a sweeper can deliver the final blow.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune is a lot more straightforward to wall because it mostly lacks recovery and acts like any other special sweeper. As Suicune is relatively slow, general offensive pressure can take it down even if one lacks solid checks. Substitute Suicune can be trickier for defensive teams because it masquerades as offensive Suicune, but Substitute turns its checks into setup fodder. One should look out for signs like weather changers or Ice-type coverage on a teammate, and preserve Tyranitar or other generic Suicune counters like Zapdos where possible.</p> <p>RestTalk Suicune may be mistaken for generic offensive Suicune or defensive Suicune. While general offensive pressure is just as effective in dealing with RestTalk Suicune, defensive teams with Blissey have to be careful not to simply get steamrolled. Again, one should look out for telltale signs, such as a powerful Surf, the presence of Tyranitar suggesting a Suicune set that doesn't mind sand much, lacking maximum HP, or aggressively setting up early-game. The priorities should then shift towards immediate phazing, setting Spikes, and putting oneself in offensive positions that avoid Suicune getting a free setup turn.</p> <p>The following is a summary of strategic methods of dealing with Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Indirect Damage</strong>: Suicune is adversely affected by sand and Spikes; to prevent Suicune from recovering from the passive damage endlessly via Rest, offensive pressure, Explosion, or Taunt forces Suicune to give up using Rest or never wake up healthy again. Teams without sand and Spikes are more pressed to use dedicated Suicune counters like Snorlax and Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion users such as Gengar, Metagross, Cloyster, Forretress, and Claydol can take a chunk out of Suicune to limit its setup and break its Rest loops. This is even more potent if the Explosion user is faster, as Explosion ends the turn before Suicune can act. Explosion also mitigates offensive Suicune's onslaught.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Phazers can delay defensive Suicune while it's sleeping, but will not make progress alone. Using phazers with Spikes provides the chip damage needed to force Rest uses and withers away the rest of the team such that when Suicune is the last Pokemon standing, it can be dealt with using offensive pressure, Taunt, or Explosion. The best phazers are those that cannot be trapped, as defensive Suicune often comes with Dugtrio or Magneton; hence, while Tyranitar and Skarmory can do the job, they aren't as reliable as Zapdos, Swampert, and Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt stops defensive Suicune from setting up and using Rest. The most prominent Taunt user is Gengar, which also has the luxury of threatening Suicune with Will-O-Wisp, Thunderbolt, and sometimes Explosion. It cannot easily switch into Suicune, however, and is better used to beat it in the late-game. Another Taunt user is Gyarados, which is able to set up on Suicune. Gyarados is highly favored to beat defensive Suicune and can heavily chip offensive Suicune, though it has some trouble getting past the latter due to Ice Beam.</p> <p>The following are Pokemon that can deal with Suicune directly.</p> <p><strong>Celebi</strong>: Leech Seed Celebi is the best answer to defensive Suicune. It has naturally high bulk, a resistance to Suicune's STAB attacks, Leech Seed to wear away at Suicune's health, and STAB Grass-type attacks to prevent Suicune from attempting to stall it out via Rest. Some Celebi may even carry Perish Song or Calm Mind to boost up with non-Roar Suicune. Faster Celebi can even use Leech Seed on offensive Suicune and attempt to stall it out with Recover, though Celebi is likely to get frozen or receive a critical hit eventually. Celebi is very unreliable against faster Suicune though, as they can threaten to 2HKO Celebi with boosted Ice Beam or simply wall its Leech Seed via Substitute and set up on it for free.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is the best offensive answer to defensive Suicune, as threatens it with STAB Thunderbolt, can phase it with Roar, and has naturally high Special Defense. Note that Zapdos needs to be healthy to check Suicune. Offensive sets can be chipped and worn down while switching in, while defensive sets can be forced to use Rest. Zapdos is a lot less resilient against offensive Suicune. There is a good chance that bulkless Zapdos gets OHKOed by +1 offensive Suicune's Ice Beam, and defensive Zapdos is frequently in a losing position if Suicune outspeeds it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: The tier's premier answer to special attackers, Blissey does extremely well against offensive Suicune, threatening to inflict status on it with Toxic or Thunder Wave and gradually wear it down while walling its attacks. However, it cannot beat Rest Suicune, becoming a short-term wall that forces Suicune to use Rest while relying on teammates to make progress. Blissey can be exploited by a healthy Substitute Suicune or RestTalk Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's high natural Special Defense allows it to switch into Suicune and set up or simply lay into it with powerful attacks. However, Suicune's high physical bulk presents a challenge. Defensive Snorlax struggles to push through defensive Rest Suicune, and can be worn down by offensive variants. Offensive Snorlax is usually forced to use Self-Destruct to try and take Suicune down.</p> <p><strong>Milotic</strong>: Milotic can stop offensive Suicune, especially non-Hidden Power Grass variants, in its tracks with Toxic and Recover. It can also wall defensive Suicune and force it to use Rest. Just like Blissey, it is setup fodder for Substitute Suicune and RestTalk Suicune.</p> <p><strong>Salamence</strong>: Choice Band Salamence makes for an interesting answer, as it resists Surf and can switch into Suicune without Ice Beam, threatening a roll to 3HKO defensive variants with Hidden Power Flying in sand or a critical hit while Suicune continuously uses Rest. Additionally, Salamence's Speed allows it to revenge kill worn-down offensive Suicune in certain scenarios. Its vulnerability to Ice Beam renders it imperfect as a check.</p> <p><strong>Regice</strong>: Regice combines high Special Defense with solid Special Attack to pressure Suicune with any of Thunderbolt, the rare Psych Up, and Explosion followed by Dugtrio. However, it has no longevity whatsoever, can be set up on, and can be outlasted by defensive Suicune in most scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>: Jirachi can use Calm Mind alongside Suicune variants lacking Roar, and pound them with Electric-type coverage. Jirachi's particular vulnerability to one of the most common moves in particular—Roar — renders it imperfect as a check.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur resists Surf, uses Leech Seed, and can disrupt offensive Suicune variants with Sleep Powder. However, it lacks Celebi's bulk and recovery and is more prone to being worn down.</p> <p><strong>Vaporeon</strong>: Vaporeon is technically a perfect counter to Suicune, as its Water Absorb renders it immune to Surf and it can threaten to remove Suicune's boosts via Roar or Haze, but it is vulnerable to Toxic, Hidden Power Grass, and PP stalling, as it cannot harm Suicune outside of Toxic.</p>",

        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind, Surf, and Rest maximize Suicune's longevity and ability to sweep against virtually any sort of opposition.</p> <p>The last move is mostly a matter of what the team needs. Roar is the preferred option to phaze other setup sweepers such as Suicune, Curse Snorlax, and Dragon Dance Salamence, and it tends to provide the best general utility by complementing Spikes or covering for a weak defensive backbone. Ice beam nails Salamence and Grass-types that resist Surf as well as hitting Zapdos super effectively. Sleep Talk counteracts one of Rest's primary detriments by allowing Suicune to move while sleeping, which helps to exploit defensive teams that answer Suicune by forcing it to use Rest and then phazing with a Pokemon like Whirlwind Skarmory, which dislikes Surf; it also gives Suicune the potential to hold its ground against Zapdos and Starmie with continuous boosts. Keep in mind that this momentum comes at the cost of Suicune relying entirely on Surf to take out its checks and thus being more exploitable by Water-resistant threats.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Suicune's ability to take physical hits while outspeeding fully invested base 55 Speed Pokemon, including lesser-seen but dangerous threats like Marowak. The defensive EVs give Suicune 401 HP, ensuring that it survives 4 uses of Seismic Toss in sand and 5 outside of it, which can be important if Blissey tries to fish for full paralysis on a Suicune paralyzed by Thunder Wave. The Defense investment avoids a guaranteed 3HKO from threats like Choice Band Aerodactyl and Choice Band Metagross even in sand. An alternative is to run around 68 Speed EVs to outrun maximum invested neutral Speed Tyranitar as well as slower Pokemon around that range, such as offensive Swampert and Body Slam Jirachi.</p> <p>As Suicune needs several boosts to become a threat, many teams check it by whittling it down with offensive pressure or walling it, forcing it to use Rest, and phazing it with Spikes up. Thus, this Suicune is generally meant to be played carefully until its impediments are identified and the appropriate lines of play become clear. Blissey and Celebi should be PP stalled to set up an eventual sweep, while offensive counters should be worn down and removed. Using weather-clearing moves to remove sandstorm or spinners to remove Spikes throughout the game is also critical to keep Suicune from accumulating chip damage and being forced to use Rest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune has a number of compromising issues that it appreciates teammates' abilities to handle. Spikes are a consistent thorn in Suicune's side, whittling away at it on the switch and making it difficult for it to stand up to physical attackers such as Salamence and Metagross. Claydol's Rapid Spin removes Spikes, while its solid bulk and resistance to Rock allow it to fend off Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Magneton, on the other hand, can trap Skarmory, limiting the layers of Spikes it can put down and destroying a phazer that can disrupt Suicune's attempts at sweeping, as well as switch into Aerodactyl's Rock Slide and potentially trap Choice Band Metagross. Beyond the Spikes weakness, pairing Rock-resistant Pokemon with Suicune is generally prudent to keep it from being exploited by sand and Rock Slide flinches— Metagross and Jirachi are other such Pokemon. Despite sharing a dislike of Skarmory, Metagross threatens Blissey, Snorlax, and other special walls that switch into Suicune with its powerful Meteor Mash and fends off Tyranitar and Aerodactyl consistently. Jirachi can form a Calm Mind core with Suicune, where they weaken special walls in tandem. Jirachi can also spread paralysis via Body Slam or Thunder and pass Wish to help Suicune's longevity.</p> <p>As far as mitigating Suicune's weaknesses and counters go, support is generally easy to come by. Suicune's weakness to Electric-types—primarily Zapdos, as well as Jolteon to a lesser degree—can be covered by partnering it with Blissey or Celebi. Like Jirachi, Blissey can run Wish or spread paralysis for Suicune, while Celebi can support Suicune with Leech Seed and Baton Pass. Spikers like Skarmory and Forretress act as backup physical walls, switch into Celebi, and help non-Ice Beam Suicune take advantage of Roar and rack up Spikes damage on its counters. With some chip damage, Dugtrio can trap and remove Celebi, Jirachi, Tyranitar, and Metagross, which Suicune generally appreciates. As an additional support option, Dugtrio can run Sunny Day, threatening to trap Tyranitar and clear its sand to give Suicune free rein. Choice Band Salamence is a strong pivot against physically based threats, and its Intimidate can help ease Suicune's entry or cover its back when weakened. Gengar's disruptive abilities are generally appreciated by Suicune, and its Will-O-Wisp can compromise special walls and open a window for Suicune to go to town.</p>"

        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Suicune is an omnipresent threat defined by its versatility, having a number of move choices that can ease certain matchups and bypass particular checks while being consistently threatening to standard bulky offense. This set focuses on the variant without Substitute, which is devastating to all but Blissey and Milotic.</p> <p>Calm Mind gives Suicune a way to push through defensive checks such as Zapdos, Celebi, and Snorlax, . Hydro Pump is the preferred STAB option, as its higher damage is critical in OHKOing uninvested Tyranitar and wearing down Pokemon like Snorlax. One can run Surf if concerned about Hydro Pump's low accuracy and PP, though.</p> <p>Ice Beam hits Pokemon that resist Water like Celebi and Salamence. While defensive Celebi can theoretically switch into slower Suicune and attempt to hold it off with Leech Seed and Recover, Suicune frequently has the upper hand; the odds of Suicune landing a critical hit or freeze in four turns is about 50%. Ice Beam also gives Suicune a reliable way of hitting Zapdos and knocking out weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>Roar's primary purpose is to maintain momentum. It prevents other Calm Mind users like Celebi and Jirachi from checking Suicune by boosting alongside it and phazes opposing slower Suicune. This can be important on teams with multiple offensive Calm Mind users that favor momentum over a defensive backbone; these teams can be crushed if the opponent sets up earlier or in a favorable position. Roar also occasionally allows Suicune to rack up Spikes damage, given that offensive Suicune is pretty good at forcing switches against some common Pokemon like Tyranitar, Salamence, and Swampert.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used in place of Roar to inflict heavy damage on opposing Suicune before it gets a chance to set up or phaze. It also crushes Swampert and helps Suicune get past Milotic and Vaporeon. It is a good choice when one has Calm Mind checks like Snorlax and other phazers.</p> <p>Offensive Roar and three-attacks Suicune tend to require support against checks like Blissey and Zapdos. Toxic provides another interesting support alternative, compromising Zapdos and opposing Suicune while either forcing Blissey and Celebi to switch or wearing them down to the point that one-on-one battles are feasible. Toxic is particularly deadly when paired with Dugtrio, which can switch in to pick off the weakened Blissey or Celebi. Rest is an option to shrugs off status that would otherwise put Suicune on a timer and gain longevity against checks like Seismic Toss Blissey, allowing Suicune to boost with impunity and burn through their PP.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune's EVs vary widely, as there are a number of tradeoffs to be made in Speed, power, and bulk. Relevant Speed benchmarks are 16 EVs for Marowak and some Milotic, 68 EVs for neutral Dragon Dance Tyranitar, offensive Swampert, and Body Slam Jirachi, 152 EVs for all Tyranitar, Adamant Metagross, Modest Magneton, and slower Celebi and Jirachi, and 228 EVs for Jolly Metagross and Breloom, Timid Magneton, Cloyster, and a larger proportion of Celebi and Jirachi, which have a wide variance in Speed. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Heracross, Modest Moltres, and some Zapdos and Salamence, but this sacrifices a significant amount of Special Attack.</p> <p>Every EV taken out of Special Attack and HP is a compromise. The yardstick of any Water-type in ADV is its ability to deal with Tyranitar. Even with maximum Special Attack investment, Suicune's Hydro Pump has a slim chance of leaving bulkless Tyranitar standing. To make matters worse, even maximum HP Suicune has a decent chance of getting 2HKOed by Adamant Dragon Dance Tyranitar should it miss Hydro Pump or get flinched by Rock Slide. Considering the complexities of Suicune's interactions, EV spreads for Suicune are extremely subjective. Some helpful concrete benchmarks, however, include 56 HP and 128 HP EVs to survive Aerodactyl's Double-Edge with and without getting KOed by sand and 120 HP EVs to survive Modest Zapdos's Thunderbolt in sand.</p> <p>Offensive Suicune has potential utility in all phases of the game, depending on the particular variant being used and the matchup. Traditionally, Roar, three-attacks, and Toxic variants shine as leads or early- to mid-game threats, creating immediate pressure against most leads, threatening to punch through shakier checks like Snorlax, Celebi and Skarmory from the get-go, and easily switching out of passive counters like Milotic and Blissey. Suicune switch into offensive threats like Metagross and Tyranitar early-game to wrest back momentum, if its team lacks a sturdier switch-in. However, Suicune can also be used late-game to clean up teams that are weak to offensive Water-types, such as offensive teams that try to use Aerodactyl, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Salamence as late-game sweepers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Suicune fits best on offensive teams; it features most prominently in special offense, especially teams with multiple offensive Calm Mind users, namely Celebi, Jirachi, and sometimes Raikou.</p> <p>Dugtrio synergizes extremely well with Suicune. It is almost always required on Spikesless specially offensive teams for its ability to remove weakened Blissey or, if it runs a specially defensive spread, 2HKO it while surviving Ice Beam in a one-on-one situation. Common methods of weakening Blissey are sacrificing a Calm Mind-boosted Pokemon like Jirachi, Celebi, or the occasional Jynx and luring it with Gengar or Regice and using Explosion. Gengar has the added benefit of being a switch-in to Snorlax, which is often the special tank that threatens specially offensive teams the most; Regice switches into Zapdos and Starmie and can also use Explosion on lured Snorlax. One does not necessarily need to weaken Blissey— even passing multiple Calm Mind boosts from Celebi to Dugtrio so that it is 3HKOed by Blissey's Ice Beam is a possible strategy for removing it. Dugtrio removes weakened Celebi and Jirachi too, which are much easier for Suicune to handle but can still be impediments due to their Leech Seed and status moves. Defensively, Dugtrio serves as a check and revenge killer to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which is a weakness generated from using offensive Suicune instead of a bulkier Water-type like Swampert.</p> <p>Suicune does not have to be confined to specially offensive teams. It generally synergizes well with physically offensive Pokemon — Metagross, Snorlax, and Tyranitar all exert massive pressure on special walls that check Suicune. Metagross's Rock resistance helps cover Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, while Snorlax can switch into Zapdos and Jolteon, and Tyranitar's sand helps pressure Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi. Heracross is another dangerous physical attacker that can switch into Blissey and Celebi and threaten to cleave defensive teams open, aiding Suicune immensely. Pairing Suicune with Spikes is also a viable option— Skarmory can take over switching into Metagross early-game, and Spikes can chip away at Suicune's checks, particularly in conjunction with Roar. Offensive Swampert sets pair extremely well with Suicune in a double Water-type core, as Swampert and Suicune can pressure their shared answers while improving a team's defense against dangerous physical threats. Jirachi provides a Rock-type resistance to back up Suicune against Aerodactyl; defensive sets offer Wish support, while offensive sets can help to overload shared counters. Together with Dugtrio, Suicune and Jirachi provide not only significant offensive potency but also a decent defensive backbone against Aerodactyl and Tyranitar.</p>"
        },
        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute Suicune is a variant of offensive Suicune that generally has more utility in the late-game. This analysis primarily explores maximum HP Substitute Suicune, which can beat Blissey one-on-one outside of sand thanks to its 101 HP Substitute withstanding Seismic Toss. Substitute also provides protection against status from Milotic, Leech Seed from Celebi, and Explosion from slower Pokemon like Metagross and Snorlax, turning what would ordinarily be checks into setup fodder. The downside to Substitute Suicune is that unlike standard offensive Suicune, it cannot phaze or take out opposing Suicune, and maximum HP versions need to drop coverage or rely on partners for sand removal.</p> <p>Ideally, Substitute Suicune obtains enough Calm Mind boosts to overwhelm the opponent, so the extra power Hydro Pump offers over Surf is unnecessary. This is by far the dominant preference. However, Surf Suicune usually needs to be at full HP to beat Blissey. Where that condition is a challenge, using Hydro Pump instead gives Suicune the possibility of taking out Blissey with one less boost. Also, Hydro Pump with high Special Attack investment gives Suicune the possibility of OHKOing Dragon Dance Tyranitar should Suicune need to be used defensively.</p> <p>Ice Beam hits Celebi and Salamence, and provides Suicune a reliable way of hitting Zapdos hard. It is mostly used when the team has a Rain Dance or Sunny Day user to remove sand. Without a weather changer, Rain Dance becomes a key move of the set. Rain Dance Suicune is a potent weather changer, as it can clear sand in time to beat Blissey even in the face of Tyranitar by forcing Tyranitar out. Note that rain multiplies damage on top of Calm Mind boosts, making it easier to take out Blissey too.</p> <p>While Substitute Suicune is known for its late-game prowess, Toxic makes it a good lead that can immediately provide pressure as the opponent switches to Blissey or Celebi. It also helps take out these special walls in the late-game. As Toxic takes several turns to accumulate damage, this set is sometimes better used mid-game, especially when Pokemon like Salamence or Zapdos remain.</p> <p>There are a couple of fringe sets that require heavy support to function. Roar in the last slot prevents Suicune from being walled by opposing Suicune, but dropping Ice Beam makes dealing with Celebi tricky. The ability to set up on opposing Suicune and Milotic unimpeded is a huge asset on rain-based teams, which naturally have a weather changer already; there, the most straightforward way to deal with Celebi is to lure it with Explosion Gengar and follow up with Dugtrio. Short of entirely removing Celebi, Spikes with Speed investment on Suicune to block Leech Seed is an interesting way of mitigating those issues; after six boosts, Suicune can phaze Celebi. The opponent is then forced to give up the Pokemon brought in or switch back to Celebi, which takes Spikes damage and then gets 2HKOed. The same can be done to Milotic, which does not get 2HKOed without significant Special Attack investment. Protect is another viable option on rain-based teams. Protect increases Suicune's longevity significantly in the absence of sand and allows Suicune to set up on Blissey and Swampert more comfortably; in the right circumstances, it even allows Suicune to set up on Snorlax, Starmie and mixed Salamence.</p> <p>As far as EVs go, Substitute Suicune by and large uses maximum HP to ensure that Blissey's Seismic Toss does not break Substitute. This unfortunately starves Suicune of offensive investment, and subjective tradeoffs have to be made. 172 and 96 Special Attack EVs are needed to 2HKO Blissey with 252 and 44 HP EVs, respectively. Unfortunately, the former only leaves enough Speed to outrun Body Slam Jirachi and neutral Dragon Dance Tyranitar; strictly speaking, only 64 Speed EVs are needed, leaving a spread of 192 SpA / 64 Spe. The latter, which outspeeds all Tyranitar, Adamant Metagross, Modest Magneton, and slower Celebi and Jirachi, frequently lacks in power against Blissey and other checks Suicune can potentially break through like Celebi, Zapdos, Snorlax, and Heracross; again, only 152 Speed EVs are needed, leaving a spread of 104 SpA / 152 Spe. Given these massive tradeoffs, a minority of Substitute Suicune simply forgo HP in favor of Speed and Special Attack. This is a good option on teams that are comfortable facing Blissey but not Celebi, such as those with Snorlax or mixed Metagross.</p> <p>Note that Suicune usually needs to be a turn ahead to reach +6 and beat Blissey convincingly. This requires Blissey to switch into Suicune as it starts setting up, or, less preferably, trick Blissey into using a status move as Suicune uses Substitute. Careful planning is paramount to getting Substitute Suicune to work.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Suicune works best on offensive teams, though in a somewhat distinct manner from standard offensive Suicune. Its ability to set up on Blissey comes with a set of hurdles that usually have to be supported by teammates.</p> <p>Removing sand is necessary for non-Rain Dance Suicune to beat Blissey. Ideal weather changing teammates should have relatively disposable moveslots, be difficult to trap, and be fast or bulky enough to clear the weather before they get KOed. Such partners include Rain Dance Zapdos, Sunny Day Dugtrio, Sunny Day Moltres, and possibly Kingdra on rain teams. Rain Dance Magneton is easily trapped, but has two disposable moveslots and can run an Endure + Salac Berry set if one is really desperate. Note that Dugtrio is helpful for permanently removing Tyranitar but is not necessary.</p> <p>As Suicune usually needs to be near full HP to beat Blissey, mitigating Spikes is important. Magneton traps Skarmory and Forretress in an attempt to limit them to one layer of Spikes and makes sure Skarmory does not continuously accumulate damage on Suicune by phazing. Alternatively, one can use a spinner like offensive Claydol, whose Explosion has a myriad of uses like removing Zapdos and Celebi and weakening Tyranitar for a Dugtrio trap, which enables permanent sand removal later. Choice Band Metagross and Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax can also lure and remove Skarmory and Forretress.</p> <p>As Suicune needs to preserve its HP if it wants to beat Blissey, it prefers not to act as the bulky Water-type early-game and so appreciates partners that can check or at least trade with physical threats like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence. These include offensive or Endeavor Swampert, Dugtrio, and mixed Metagross. This division of labor is highly efficient, because it's more likely that the teams that can overwhelm these teammates and require your Suicune to be used defensively are physically offensive and lack passive Pokemon that require Suicune's Substitute. Kingdra performs a slightly similar function on rain teams, though a more accurate description of its role is to conquer offensive teams, while Substitute Suicune dominates defensive teams.</p> <p>Another way to keep Suicune's HP up is Wish, which eliminates damage that Suicune takes from being used defensively, using Substitute, and switching into Spikes. The best Wish users for supporting Substitute Suicune are reasonably fast because they can use Wish right before sacrificing themselves so that Suicune gets the Wish without getting hit. These include Salamence, Jirachi, and Jolteon.</p> <p>Removing and pressuring Suicune's checks is always appreciated. Mixed Explosion Metagross lures in Zapdos and Celebi; it can also use Pursuit to chip Gengar into KO range of Suicune's Surf. Snorlax can switch into opposing Suicune and threaten to use Self-Destruct. If Suicune does not have Ice Beam, then having other sources of Ice-type coverage and switch-ins to Salamence like Porygon2 and, again, offensive or Endeavor Swampert is immensely useful. Suicune without Ice Beam will also need to remove Celebi, in which case Dugtrio, with its added utility of changing weather and revenge killing physical threats, becomes a prime partner. Pokemon that appreciate sand removal like Salac Berry Heracross and Snorlax make for natural partners to Rain Dance Suicune.</p>"
        },
        "Modest RestTalk": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Modest RestTalk Suicune is an offensive Suicune variant designed to combine longevity with consistent damage and offensive pressure. Its premise is simple: RestTalk affords it both recovery and the ability to continuously boost and attack, rendering it practically immune to status and a threat to phazers. Its simplicity belies its effectiveness, however, as it can easily accumulate boosts against unsuspecting checks and snowball its way through a team. This Suicune is, in particular, a stallbreaker that attempts to exploit the single turn of Sleep Talk by threatening to hit phazers with Sleep Talk Surf for massive damage as they switch in, all without the opponent making any progress. The result is a sweeper that can find early-game setup opportunities and exert constant pressure until a window emerges for it to sweep.</p> <p>An important factor in understanding Suicune's use involves the mechanics behind Sleep Talk; if Suicune switches out immediately after using Sleep Talk, then the turns spent sleeping are reset to zero, thereby giving it two further sleep turns. However, if Sleep Talk is not used on Suicune's next turn of sleep before switching, Suicune wakes up as normal. Suicune can thus use Sleep Talk while the phazer comes in and simply continue sleeping on the turn it is phazed. When all is said and done, Suicune awakens quickly and the phazer has had no opportunity to do damage or, in the case of Skarmory, lay Spikes. Furthermore, when combined with teammates that provide consistent and constant pressure on Skarmory, the phaze rarely brings in Pokemon that Skarmory can set Spikes on without being punished.</p> <p>This Suicune is particularly threatening to teams with Skarmory + Swampert + Blissey cores, as it can switch in easily throughout the game and accumulate boosts, use Rest at opportune moments, and then let loose with Surf against the lineup of Pokemon that don't resist Water. The EV spread tends towards power and bulk, with a little Speed to ensure that Suicune outruns slower wallbreakers like Marowak. Other Speed benchmarks like 68 or 152 EVs to outrun Adamant or Jolly Dragon Dance Tyranitar can also be used. Taking out EVs from either HP or Special Attack can be reasonable; surviving an extra Seismic Toss isn't that important when Suicune can boost while sleeping anyway.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As potent as RestTalk Suicune is, its reliance on Surf leaves it slowed down by Pokemon that resist Water such as other Suicune, Celebi, Salamence, and Vaporeon. Thus, this Suicune set partners well with offensive threats that appreciate its ability to switch into Swampert and Blissey consistently and constantly pressure TSS teams. In particular, offensive Explosion users like Metagross and Snorlax can switch into some of Suicune's answers while luring opposing Suicune and Celebi, easing Suicune's path to a sweep. Mixed Metagross in particular is another Pokemon that targets TSS cores while luring Zapdos and Celebi, while Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax tends to lure Explosion, which could stop Suicune, from opposing Metagross. Endeavor Swampert is an interesting partner, threatening to remove RestTalk Suicune counters in opposing Suicune and Celebi via Endeavor and providing Ice Beam coverage for Salamence. Most of these offensive threats not only prepare Suicune's sweep but also maintain the pressure on Skarmory should it phaze Suicune, preventing it from setting Spikes freely. Should one want a Spikes setter, Taunt Skarmory or Forretress can fulfill that role and prevent opposing Skarmory from setting Spikes as well.</p> <p>With regard to defensive synergies, Porygon2 can switch into mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence indefinitely and trap Dugtrio before it gets a chance to remove Suicune while sleeping. Claydol provides a Thunderbolt switch-in, a Rock resistance, and the ability to remove Spikes to facilitate Suicune's entrance. While not as common, Flygon is a good partner, as it is a Spikes-immune Pokemon that can check Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and non-Hidden Power Ice Zapdos while appreciating Suicune's ability to carve up Swampert + Skarmory + Blissey cores. Wish users like Salamence, Blissey, and Jirachi can assist Suicune by easing its entry while sleeping. Celebi can support Suicune against Electric-type attacks while checking opposing Suicune, and it can support Suicune's longevity and offensive pressure with Leech Seed and Baton Pass.</p>"

Even if Forretress's only attacks are Earthquake and Rapid Spin, it can often stall the Choice Band set out of PP while slowly whittling it down with Rapid Spin. Steelix, Metagross, Rhydon, and Golem take virtually no damage from Swellow even from sets packing Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting and can OHKO with Rock Slide. Aerodactyl has to be wary of switching in on Facade, but it outspeeds and OHKOes Swellow with Rock Slide. Ghost-types such as Gengar and Dusclops can switch into Swellow's STAB Normal attacks and KO it, but if Dusclops's only attack is Shadow Ball or Night Shade, it won't do anything back. In short, anything that can take a hit and strike back with a super effective move checks Swellow pretty well, as it is frail.</p>",

Facade is to take advantage of Guts, making a burned Swellow a definite force to be reckoned with, while Return / Double-Edge allow Swellow to do damage without being statused. This set works very well in tandem with Medicham, as the latter takes out Rock- and Steel-types and resists Rock-type attacks (although it can only take one or two hits before going down, anyway). Medicham also lures out Weezing and Dusclops like no other, and Swellow can switch into Will-O-Wisp to activate Guts and sweep their team, though it will probably have to switch out of Dusclops and come back for a sweep late-game when the latter has been weakened sufficiently. Quick Attack can go over one of the Normal-type moves for taking out users of Salac + Flail / Reversal. Hidden Power Fighting is primarily for OHKOing Tyranitar, while Hidden Power Ground hits Metagross hard. Skarmory and Normal-types are hit harder by Return no matter which Hidden Power you choose, however. Sleep Talk can be used over one of the other moves, but since Facade is not boosted by sleep, you are better off not using this.

Return is better for general sweeping purposes, but Quick Attack works as a way of finishing off Salac Berry users and helps against Ninjask. Swellow can set up a Substitute safely if it switches into something it forces out, such as Heracross or Blissey. Once you see what they switch to, you can decide if you want Swellow to attack them or Baton Pass your Substitute to a teammate that will survive the foe's hit. If Swellow gets down to low health and is ready to Endeavor, but you know that the opponent will KO next turn, it can always Baton Pass the Liechi Berry boost out to a sweeper to soften up their team and switch in late-game to clean up. This is the advantage of Swellow's Speed--it doesn't need a Salac boost to be fast enough to Endeavor properly. You can just keep Swellow in the wings, threatening to Endeavor whatever late-game enemy is blocking a member of your team or simply take out weakened enemies along the way. Swellow also doesn't need to use Endeavor immediately after Substituting down to low HP.</p> <p>Other options for the item are Salac Berry and Petaya Berry depending on your team, but Liechi is guaranteed to at least help Swellow (especially if you have Return). Starf is a real option, though; no boost is useless when Swellow can pass it to the appropriate team. For example, Choice Band Salamence is nigh-unbeatable when their counter takes 50% damage from it and can no longer OHKO with Ice Beam thanks to +2 Special Defense. Similarly, Heracross can survive Aerial Ace from Dugtrio with +2 Defense and KO back with Megahorn.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Pelipper differentiates itself from the other bulky Water-types in Wailord, Dewgong, and Whiscash by being immune to Spikes and taking neutral damage from Grass-type attacks. These factors increase Pelipper's longevity, since it's not exposed to constant chip damage and is not at risk of being removed by Hidden Power Grass from Flareon or Torkoal as easily as other Water-types are. Additionally, Pelipper is a rather solid Hitmonchan check, only fearing the not-so-common Rock Slide, and handles other threats like Metang rather well. Unfortunately, Pelipper is unable to check Rock- and Water-types like Relicanth, Pupitar, and Wailord as favorably as other bulky Water-types, and it's unable to reliably perform as anything other than a wall due to being outclassed offensively by other Water-types like Huntail, Wailord, and Dewgong.</p>",

Hidden Power Flying lets Pelipper deal with Roselia and Hitmonchan more effectively. Offensive sets with Agility are feasible due to Pelipper's good coverage, but other offensive Water-types provide more utility or power and are thus preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pikachu, Plusle, and Minun all outspeed Pelipper and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Furthermore, forcing Pelipper out allows them to set Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Wailord and Dewgong dislike being poisoned by Toxic, although they take little damage from Pelipper's attacks and OHKO it in return with Hidden Power Electric. Octillery can viably use Lum Berry to prevent Pelipper's Toxic from being as annoying and easily OHKOes it with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p><strong>Roselia</strong>: Roselia isn't 2HKOed by Pelipper's Ice Beam and can set Spikes fairly safely against it.</p>",

Toxic is an alternative to Ice Beam that allows Pelipper to cripple opposing Water-types in Wailord and Dewgong. Rest increases Pelipper's longevity and cleanses it of poison from Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Metang. Sleep Talk makes it harder for foes to take advantage of Pelipper while it's asleep. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature helps Pelipper switch into Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Metang, and Murkrow more reliably, while the remaining 4 EVs are thrown into Speed so Pelipper outspeeds uninvested Roselia.</p> <p>It's very important to be cautious when switching into certain Pokemon; offensive Hitmonchan variants sometimes carry Rock Slide for Flying-types like Pelipper, and Metang almost always has Explosion, which can heavily dent Pelipper. Although Surf is a relatively low-drawback move to use, it's helpful to predict switches to Roselia and Cacturne by using Ice Beam, which helps dissuade them from setting Spikes. Similarly, using Toxic is a good way to punish Water-type wallbreakers in Wailord and Dewgong that may switch into Pelipper. Thanks to Pelipper's Spikes immunity, it doesn't have to worry as much about switching out after using Rest, so don't feel obligated to keep Pelipper in to brute force through sleep turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Pelipper is incredibly vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, it appreciates Pokemon like Roselia and Lickitung that can switch into such attacks; additionally, both provide cleric support and check offensive Water-types well. Pelipper also benefits from Rock-type checks like Hitmonchan and Chimecho. Pokemon like Pikachu, Lickitung, and Chimecho appreciate Pelipper's handling of Hitmonchan as well as Metang, which threatens to power through the latter two with its strong Meteor Mash.</p>"

Even without the boost from its Petaya Berry, Masquerain can threaten many attackers and physical walls such as Rhyhorn, Castform, and Staryu. With Substitute, Masquerain can more reliably self-activate Petaya Berry. Hydro Pump is Masquerain's strongest move and has a chance to OHKO both Elekid and Aipom when at +1. Giga Drain provides Masquerain with a form of recovery while keeping it from relying on Hydro Pump's poor accuracy against Rock- and Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Cubone. Agility allows Masquerain to outspeed and threaten faster attackers such as Aipom, Elekid, and Chinchou. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to hit bulky Grass-types such as Sunflora, Bayleef, and Lileep which otherwise wall Masquerain. Ice Beam also allows Masquerain to focus its efforts on wallbreaking rather than relying on Agility to clean. Intimidate allows Masquerain to pivot in on weaker physical attackers, such as Koffing, or attackers that lack strong coverage, such as Shuppet. Masquerain's mediocre base Speed means it appreciates the boost that a Timid nature provides it. This allows it to Speed tie with other base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Wailmer and Growlithe. Modest can also be used but the only notable thing it can accomplish is securing a more favorable chance to OHKO Aipom, which requires the use of Agility.</p> <p>Masquerain thrives on bulky offense builds that appreciate special wallbreakers or late-game cleaners. Masquerain appreciates paralysis support from Pokemon such as Nosepass, Magnemite, and Chinchou. Chinchou deserves a special mention, as it's able to switch into Electric- and Ice-type moves for Masquerain and paralyze offensive threats that outspeed it, such as Elekid and opposing Chinchou. Other sweepers like Bagon, Mankey, and Croconaw appreciate Masquerain's role compression, which allows it to act as a sweeper or wallbreaker. Physical attackers such as Pidgeotto, Aipom, and Cubone can threaten special walls such as Delcatty and Dustox for Masquerain. These physical attackers also threaten Substitute + Calm Mind Spoink, which otherwise turns Masquerain into setup fodder. Dustox makes for a fantastic partner; it can phaze out Spoink with Whirlwind while walling special attackers that threaten Masquerain, such as Elekid and Chinchou. It's also a more reliable check to Koffing, which helps prevent Masquerain from being statused.

Brick Break threatens both Rhyhorn and Onix, which take on non-Swarm Signal Beam. Quick Attack provides Volbeat with a valuable form of speed control, allowing it to revenge kill common pinch Berry users such as Abra, Beedrill, and Quilava. Double-Edge provides Volbeat with a nice midground for bulky Poison-types such as Koffing and Ariados, which otherwise come in for free.

Strong physical attackers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Ponyta can overload Volbeat's defensive checks such as Tropius, Ariados, and Koffing. Conversely, Volbeat can neuter these defensive checks with Trick, allowing the aforementioned physical attackers more consistency when wallbreaking. Doduo and Ponyta are exceptionally good at this because of their Flying- and Fire-type STAB attacks.

Onix is worth a special mention, as its access to Explosion allows it to soften or remove bulkier foes and provide momentum, which can help open up a late-game scenario where Volbeat can clean. Volbeat is incredibly vulnerable to status, so Pokemon with Heal Bell, such as Mightyena, Flaaffy, and Delcatty, make for good teammates.

      "overview": "<p>Solrock is a staple in UU play for a good reason: it's immune to Earthquake, resists Normal and Flying, can hurt its opponents, set up dual screens, Baton Pass goodies, and use Explosion whenever it wants. It's been so influential that standards have changed: Gligar packs Toxic, Steel Wing or Iron Tail to deal with it, Fearow uses Steel Wing and some Ground-types use Hidden Power Bug or Ghost. Still, it's good to go. In standard, it can counter some Choice Banders like Salamence and Tauros pretty decently, but you'll have to predict even more accurately because despite its good HP and Defense, it takes quite a beating from neutral or super effective hits.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Psych Up, Solrock can surprise Snorlax in standard play. Come in when it has some Curses, copy them, and either try to take it out by yourself, or Baton Pass to something to handle it and the rest of your opponent's team. You may want to watch out for Shadow Ball variants though. Cosmic Power can be Baton Passed as well, but usually begs for critical hits, which you don't want. Light Screen, like Reflect, helps Solrock and the rest of the team to take hits better. Since Solrock lures Water- and Grass-types, it's not a bad idea at all.</p> <p>Body Slam can paralyze opponents sometimes, and Fire moves can hurt Steel-types like Skarmory and Forretress in OU. Toxic can help to wear down the Water-types that switch in on Solrock all the time, and finally, he doesn't make a bad Rest / Sleep Talk user. It does take away a lot of its offense though.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For most tankish Solrock, a +Defense nature like Impish is preferred. Max out its HP before working on its defenses; put its Defense somewhere between 260 and 280 to live through most hits decently. Special Defense is welcome to take on Psychic-types. A few Speed EVs isn't a bad idea either, especially if you're using Shadow Ball. Solrock ties Speed with Claydol, and of course it helps against enemy Solrock too.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In OU, Metagross awaits it with its resistance to Rock Slide and Explosion, and a STAB super effective Meteor Mash for the OHKO. Earthquake without a Choice Band will only 3HKO Metagross, so watch out. Jirachi with Reflect or Wish can be annoying to an extent, but it needs Thunderbolt and a Calm Mind to really hurt Solrock. Swampert's, Milotic's, and Suicune's high durability and STAB Surfs will be a huge problem as well, try to remove them with Explosion and sweep with something else. Check for Protect Swampert first though, or do it on the switch. Skarmory and Forretress take jack from any physical hit you throw at them. Both will put up Spikes, and Forretress sometimes uses Hidden Power Bug. Celebi can Recover off all your hits, and may pack a Grass move to really put a hurting in you. Dusclops can kill you with Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp you, block Explosion and Rest/Pain Split off the damage.</p> <p>For UU, generally Water-types and Grass-types can come in on anything Solrock does, and use their STAB attacks to put a hurting in you. Most notably Quagsire, Whiscash, Blastoise, Poliwrath (usually has no Water moves though), Politoed, and Slowking on the Water side, and Meganium, Vileplume, Bellossom, and Tangela on the Grass one. Banette can be a pain with Will-O-Wisp but won't be switching in on Rock Slides or Shadow Balls. You must beware of it when you want to use Explosion though, and the same goes for when your opponent uses Misdreavus.</p>",

Castform can use Thunderbolt to hit Water-types such as Seaking harder on the switch. However, Castform fails to 2HKO Corsola without Hidden Power Grass, which makes this change usually not worth it. Ice Beam can be used on the tank set to threaten Pokemon such as Tropius and Lileep more directly.

Castform sets itself apart from other bulky Normal-types, such as Noctowl, with its higher offensive stats and its ability in Forecast that allow Castform to answer weather-based teams more reliably. Return deals decent damage to the majority of the tier. Alternatively, Double-Edge can be used in order to threaten physical walls such as Koffing for more damage at the cost of recoil, which can put Castform in range of being KOed by Pokemon such as Choice Band Aipom. Hidden Power Grass covers Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Corsola and Rhyhorn, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. Toxic lets Castform threaten general physical walls such as Tropius and Lileep. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon such as Aipom and Gloom, making Castform a decent bulky paralysis user. Protect gives Castform a way of scouting Choice Band Pokemon such as Aipom and stalling weather turns. Castform also greatly benefits from the extra passive recovery from Leftovers that using Protect provides. Castform's EV spread allows it to survive a variety of Pokemon such as an OHKO from Choice Band Aipom, a 2HKO from Silk Scarf Ponyta and a 2HKO from Seaking under rain. The Speed investment allows Castform to outspeed base 45 Speed Pokemon like Flaaffy and Magnemite. The rest of Castform's EVs are put into Attack to make it as threatening as possible.</p> <p>Castform fits on a variety of team styles such as balance, bulky offense, and general offense teams, as many teams appreciate the defensive attributes Castform provides combined with its offensive presence. Pokemon like Abra, Aipom, and Quilava appreciate Castform's ability to check Ponyta, with the latter additionally appreciating Castform as a partner to overwhelm Normal-resistant Pokemon like Corsola. Fast Pokemon such as Ponyta and Abra appreciate Castform spreading paralysis to make them much harder to revenge kill. Castform's Toxic wears down walls such as Tropius that otherwise wall physical wallbreakers such as Aipom. Castform itself does not appreciate taking status, so Heal Bell users such as Flaaffy and Mightyena make great partners. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Quilava appreciate Castform's ability to check Rain Dance Seaking, which can take advantage of them to set up. Other setup sweepers such as Beedrill appreciate Castform checking priority users such as Ponyta. While Castform is quite bulky, some physical wallbreakers like Doduo and Meditite can threaten to OHKO it. Pokemon like Koffing can check Meditite and potentially use it as offensive momentum, while Pokemon such as Rhyhorn can switch into Doduo locked into Double-Edge to start wallbreaking.</p>"

It is a real shame, as is the case with most cool Pokemon, that it sadly isn't good enough to fit into the standard metagame. However, it is still fun to use against new players.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>EVs</h3> <p>I didn't put much in Speed when I was testing Castform. It is already so delicate that I felt it was much more important to make sure it could both withstand and dish out attacks. My EVs were pretty much 252 Attacking Stat/252 Defensive Stat/4 Speed. Nature could be either +Attack or +Defense. I tried to compensate for its lack of defenses by concentrating on only one defensive stat and using it only against Pokemon primarily of that alignment. Although it melts against attacks it isn't designed to take, this setup actually gives it decent durability. It is more vulnerable, but it is probably more effective overall. Castform really is not designed to be easy to play. If you really wanted to use mixed defenses go ahead, but I don't think it would be effective at all. I would like to see how Castform does in the UU metagame, however, which I sadly haven't played at all.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tyranitar counters almost any Castform, except perhaps ones with HP Fighting. Almost anything can potentially counter Castform. However, Castform is pretty versatile (considering that is the whole idea of him even having Forecast and Weather Ball) and you have a decent shot at surprising your opponent and maybe even scoring a kill. I don't think most people are aware of the attack options available to Castform (as far as types go). However, you probably aren't going to hurt anyone who's on top of their game (since they are evil and will just switch a wall in), but Castform is pretty fun to use regardless.</p>",

Flamethrower also has 5 more PP, but Castform will never survive to use even half of Weather Ball's PP anyway. It seems to be able to 2HKO a lot of things, but it is completely ineffective against things like Blissey and Gyarados. Tyranitar could screw up this set if it catches you on a Solar Beam, especially if it has Substitute. If it's Tyraniboah, that Substitute can hurt you pretty badly. This set can actually beat Suicune head-to-head assuming Castform gets a free Sunny Day. The time I tested it though, Castform barely survived, so there is probably a good amount of luck involved. It was still cool though.</p>"},

  "Chimecho": {
    "ru": {"sets": {"Bulky Calm Mind": {}, "Defensive Utility": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Chimecho has a very distinct niche in NU as being one of the very few Psychic-types in the tier and the most splashable one by far. This is because, unlike Metang, Chimecho resists Fighting, making it a better answer to Hitmonchan, and Chimecho is way, way bulkier than Abra, giving it far more utility. With access to a wide movepool and a decent stat spread, Chimecho is super versatile in what it can do for its team, being able to go offensive or defensive with ease. Its deep movepool and pure Psychic typing also lets Chimecho blanket check a ton of threats in the tier, from dangerous sweepers like Huntail and Haunter to defensive stalwarts like Swalot and Relicanth. All things considered, there's very little downside to using Chimecho, and it's a Pokemon to consider on every team you make.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chimecho's movepool is pretty expansive, but most of the notable examples have been mentioned already. Chimecho can fit Rain Dance and Sunny Day on any set pretty easily to support a weather-sweeping teammate. Skill Swap can be used to really mess with certain threats like Flareon and Huntail, allowing offensive Chimecho to even countersweep Huntail's team if done correctly. Psych Up can prevent Calm Mind Sableye from using Chimecho as complete setup bait. Curse can be used on Chimecho's Calm Mind sets to make it super hard to break both physically and specially--it just can't make use of the Attack boosts that come with it. Icy Wind is an interesting option to slow down certain threats like Vigoroth before Chimecho is KOed, allowing a teammate to more easily revenge kill it. Nightmare can be paired with Hypnosis, and in general is a fun move to mess with the large amount of RestTalk users in the metagame.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metang is probably the best all-around answer to Chimecho thanks to its 4x resistance to Psychic, neutrality to Hidden Power Electric, and immunity to Toxic. It can easily remove Chimecho with Explosion or whittle it down with Meteor Mash faster than Chimecho can wear it down; however, it needs to be wary of Hidden Power Fire. Dark-types are also very good switch-ins to Chimecho as they are immune to Psychic. Cacturne is probably the best example, as it also resists Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Dark and easily 2HKOes Chimecho with Hidden Power Ghost. Murkrow and Crawdaunt also easily 2HKO Chimecho with Shadow Ball and Crunch respectively, although they need to be very wary of Hidden Power Electric. Calm Mind Sableye can use most of Chimecho's sets as setup bait and eliminate it with Hidden Power Dark, though it really doesn't like Toxic unless it's running RestTalk. Mawile and Lairon can switch into Chimecho if needed and blast it with their STAB moves. While Chimecho is decently bulky, it falls short of avoiding 2HKOes from the hardest hitters in the tier, with strong Choice Band attackers like Raticate, Pidgeot, Vigoroth, Piloswine, and Flareon all being able to easily 2HKO even the most physically defensive Chimecho if it isn't behind a Reflect.</p>",

        "Defensive Support": {
          "description": "<p>This set is one of the best blanket checks in the NU metagame, in particular being a fantastic answer to the omnipresent Hitmonchan. With the given EV spread, Chimecho avoids a 2HKO from non-Choice Band Hitmonchan's Hidden Power Ghost and Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck, and it survives even Huntail's Modest rain-boosted Hydro Pump at full health. Besides being a great check to a multitude of threats in the tier, this set also supports the team in multiple ways, including crippling troubling defensive threats like Sableye with Toxic, healing status on your own Pokemon with Heal Bell, and buffering attacks with a screen of choice to make setup easier for a teammate. Yawn is a good choice to force switches or put a foe to sleep, which when combined with screen support can create a very good setup opportunity for a teammate. As a support Pokemon, this Chimecho set fits on a wide range of teams, with stall teams finding its access to Heal Bell almost invaluable and offensive teams appreciating its ability to pivot around Hitmonchan and other threats.</p> <p>Chimecho is highly flexible in its EV spread and move choices; it all comes down to what gaps you want Chimecho to fill on your team. More Defense EVs can be added to let Chimecho more reliably answer Hitmonchan and other offensive monsters like Pupitar. Alternatively, Chimecho can add more Special Defense investment to let it take on special attackers like Haunter, as Chimecho's resistance to Fighting allows it to check Hitmonchan reliably enough with just maximum HP investment.</p> <p>There's a ton of move choices that can be added and swapped around, all with their own perks and downsides over the moves listed. Icy Wind can allow Chimecho to lessen the threat of a Pokemon like Raticate that it wouldn't be able to KO with Psychic before being KOed itself. Chimecho can set up Rain Dance or Sunny Day to allow a weather sweeper like Huntail or Bellossom come in and start wreaking havoc. Finally, Taunt or Torment can allow Chimecho to effectively stallbreak when combined with Toxic and Heal Bell.</p> <p>Being able to check Hitmonchan is one of the biggest draws to using Chimecho, and using it to fill a Hitmonchan weakness is one of the easiest ways to fit it onto teams. There are some great defensive cores that Chimecho fits on to fulfill this purpose, such as with Kecleon and Relicanth or Mawile and Flareon. As a support Pokemon, Chimecho should be used to patch weaknesses in your team and its goal is not to sweep itself, but there are a few Pokemon to keep in mind that Chimecho simply can't touch with this set, most notably Steel-types like Metang and Dark-types like RestTalk Sableye. Flareon is a particularly useful partner to ensure these Pokemon don't become too problematic, and on stall teams, Wish Flareon + Sableye + Heal Bell Chimecho is one of the sturdiest defensive cores in the metagame. Finally, a dedicated sweeper like Huntail, Tangela, or Dragon Dance Pupitar should be paired with Chimecho in some manner, as it can protect their vulnerable defenses with a screen of choice and heal any status they may accrue with Heal Bell.</p>"

        "Defensive Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<p>Chimecho has many fantastic qualities of a late-game sweeper with great bulk, few weaknesses, good resistances, access to a great boosting move, and a reliable enough mono-STAB attack. Relying on just Psychic to sweep is doable in NU thanks to the general lack of Dark-types aside from Sableye, and only one of the three common Steel-types (Metang) can take repeated blows from this set. Thanks to RestTalk, Chimecho also doesn't care too much about status, allowing it to steamroll stall teams as a last Pokemon if they lack Perish Song. In the mid-game, Chimecho also has utility as being one of the best Hitmonchan checks in the tier, and thanks to Calm Mind, Chimecho can throw out some decent hits with a boosted Psychic to help secure a sweep.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs are run to outspeed minimum Speed Dewgong, with the rest of the EVs invested in making Chimecho as physically defensive as possible, as it will be boosting its Special Defense through Calm Mind to make up for the lack of investment. With the given defensive investment, Chimecho just barely avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Relicanth's Rock Slide and at +1 avoids the 2HKO from Huntail's Hydro Pump out of rain. While focusing on Defense investment is probably the better route to take, focusing on Special Defense is an option and can make Chimecho nearly impregnable from the special side. With full Special Defense investment and at +1, Chimecho avoids the 2HKO from Huntail's Hydro Pump in the rain, quite the major feat for a Pokemon that doesn't resist Water.</p> <p>This set requires some team support to work, as there are a few key threats that need to be removed before trying to sweep. This set works best against slower stall teams that lack a way to break through it outside of status, with the only major roadblock on these teams being Sableye. Pokemon that can lure in Sableye and remove it are the best partners to this set, and this includes Hitmonchan with Toxic, mixed attackers like Crawdaunt and Seviper, and super strong physical attackers like Choice Band Graveler and Piloswine. The other common Dark-type to be wary of is Murkrow, which is significantly easier to lure in and remove than Sableye due to its frailty. Other major threats that need to be removed are strong physical attackers that can 2HKO Chimecho, which includes Choice Band users, such as Raticate, Pidgeot, and Flareon. Having a super defensive teammate like Relicanth that can tank attacks from these threats and remove them is necessary.</p>"

        "Offensive Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<p>This set makes Chimecho as dangerous as possible as quickly as possible, pressuring the opponent and making it hard to switch into thanks to a good amount of power and awesome coverage. Psychic + Hidden Power Fire gets incredibly good neutral coverage in NU, with Hidden Power Fire getting a much needed super effective hit on two of the three Steel-types in Metang and Mawile, as well as a decent hit on most the dangerous Dark-types in the tier, particularly Sableye, Murkrow, and Cacturne. While Hidden Power Fire is preferred for its greater super effective coverage, Hidden Power Electric gets better neutral coverage with Psychic and is Chimecho's best weapon against the Dark-types, in particular gaining super effective hits on Murkrow and Crawdaunt. The last slot goes to the move that best supports Chimecho's team, and there's a few different choices for the last slot that each have a lot of merit. Reflect protects Chimecho from Hidden Power Ghost from Hitmonchan and Shadow Ball from other physical attackers like Raticate and Vigoroth, allowing it to beat them one-on-one. Heal Bell allows Chimecho to steamroll through defensive teams that rely on Toxic to beat it, as well as supporting the team and helping RestTalk users. Finally, Yawn can completely cripple a Pokemon on the opponent's team or force switches, allowing Chimecho more time to gain boosts with Calm Mind.</p> <p>There's quite a few directions you can take Chimecho's EV spread in, with the given one making Chimecho as powerful and bulky as possible while outspeeding minimum Speed Dewgong. Running max Speed investment with a Timid nature is an option that allows Chimecho to Speed tie with Adamant Hitmonchan and outrun Timid Tangela before it can hit Chimecho with Sleep Powder. Another option is running more defensive investment to make Chimecho more of a tank, but that's generally done better when using a RestTalk set. If you need Chimecho to check Huntail, 252 HP and 80 SpD EVs need to be run to avoid the OHKO from Hydro Pump in the rain. For alternate move choices, Hidden Power Ice is an option in the second moveslot to gain a super effective hit on Ground-types, but it comes at the cost of losing the super effective hit on Steel-types. Hidden Power Dark actually provides the best neutral coverage for Chimecho, and it gains a super effective hit on opposing Chimecho and Abra. Substitute is a fantastic move to protect Chimecho from status conditions and can be very difficult for the opponent to play around once Chimecho racks up a couple of Calm Mind boosts. Shock Wave can be used in the last slot alongside Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Dark to increase Chimecho's coverage as much as possible, although Chimecho benefits from the ability to support its team with this set.</p> <p>Spikes support is great with this set to pressure the opponent and push foes into easier KO range, particularly specially-weaker Pokemon like Piloswine and Graveler. Even without much defensive investment, Chimecho is a great answer to Hitmonchan, making Mawile and Kecleon ideal offensive partners to capitalize on this fact. Pokemon that can switch into the physical attacks that will be thrown at Chimecho make the best teammates for this set, Relicanth and Sableye in particular being good examples. Offensively, Murkrow is a great partner for Chimecho as it switches into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks easily despite its frailty and is extremely dangerous for Bellossom and Cacturne, both of which can interrupt a sweep from Chimecho.</p>"
        },
        "Offensive Support": {
          "description": "<p>This set takes a more tank-based approach to Chimecho, allowing it to retain the ability to check Hitmonchan by OHKOing it with Psychic while being very hard for the opponent to switch into. Psychic + Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Electric has very good coverage in NU, the choice between the Hidden Powers coming down to the Pokemon you wish Chimecho to beat back. Hidden Power Electric gets a neutral hit on Dark- and Steel-types, as well as scoring a super effective hit on Murkrow and Crawdaunt, while Hidden Power Fire blasts Steel-types and OHKOes Tangela in its own sun. The last two moveslots allow Chimecho to deal with stall teams, with Toxic crippling major defensive threats like Sableye and Dewgong and Taunt preventing them from healing. However, Taunt only lasts two turns, making Heal Bell a decent alternative that allows Chimecho's team to better take on stall teams and not fear status as much. Finally, Yawn can be used to force switches or put a foe to sleep, which can create a great setup opportunity for a teammate.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to make Chimecho as strong as possible while outspeeding a decent portion of offensive and defensive threats. At max Speed, Chimecho outruns Jolly Pupitar and Speed ties with neutral-natured Flareon. If running Speed investment seems unimportant to you, moving those EVs to HP is an option and makes Chimecho significantly more bulky, in particular giving it a chance to survive a Hydro Pump from Huntail in the rain and being able to OHKO Huntail in return with Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p>There are a ton of alternate move options that can be used effectively on this set, depending on what you want Chimecho to accomplish. Reflect or Light Screen can turn the tide against certain attackers, effectively allowing Chimecho to tank a hit from a foe it wouldn't be able to otherwise and KO it. Protect can be used in the last moveslot to help rack up Toxic damage and scout Choice Band users' moves. An alternate Hidden Power can be chosen if you want Chimecho to pick and choose its victims, with Hidden Power Dark being able to remove opposing Chimecho quite handily. Finally, running Substitute is an option to protect Chimecho from status and make it harder for the opponent to revenge kill Chimecho.</p> <p>This set forms a very good balanced core with Relicanth and Kecleon, with the three together checking almost every major offensive threat in the tier. This set works very well with Wish support, making Lickitung and Flareon great defensive partners as well. Pokemon that can capitalize on Chimecho's ability to break down the opponent's defenses are needed as teammates as well, with fellow special attackers, such as Huntail and Bellossom, being of particular importance. Finally, a check to opposing Calm Mind versions of Chimecho is needed when using this set, making a Dark-type like Murkrow or super strong physical attackers like Piloswine appreciated as teammates.</p>"

Ariados easily takes Sludge Bomb and threatens Koffing with Psychic, but it prefers not to take a Will-O-Wisp or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ponyta, Quilava, and Magby can take advantage of Will-O-Wisp and switch in to threaten Koffing out, though they don't enjoy taking Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Flaaffy, Elekid, and Wartortle require minimal chip damage to KO Koffing thanks to its lower special bulk, though Elekid and other frail special attackers like Chinchou and Staryu don't switch into Sludge Bomb comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Tentacool, Beedrill and Anorith can utilize Substitute to avoid Will-O-Wisp and use Koffing as setup fodder. Flamethrower and Hidden Power Water can respectively break the Substitutes of Beedrill and Anorith though.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Koffing is a great defensive answer to physical attackers and Grass-types like Meditite, Gloom, and Tropius thanks to its good physical bulk, Poison typing, and Levitate. Sludge Bomb threatens offensive Pokemon like Aipom, Seaking, and Doduo and prevents frailer special attackers that would otherwise threaten Koffing like Abra, Quilava, and Elekid from switching in safely. Hidden Power Water 2HKOes Anorith, is likely to 2HKO Cubone, and OHKOes Rhyhorn. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass hits Corsola hard and retains a good matchup against Cubone and Rhyhorn. Will-O-Wisp debilitates physical attackers like Aipom, Meditite, and Doduo. Flamethrower is a less passive alternative to break Beedrill's Substitute, prevent Magnemite from switching in, and hit Gloom and Ariados harder. Pain Split is Koffing's only recovery option besides Leftovers, but its low base HP means Pain Split gives it decent longevity and easily wears down healthy and high-HP foes like Noctowl, Tropius, and Rhyhorn. A Relaxed nature ensures Koffing's power isn't hindered while trading off Speed that is mostly useless given Koffing usually goes second against most foes, and outspeeding Corsola is less important than losing out on extra power on Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Koffing is a good fit for balance and defensive teams thanks to it taking on prominent physical attackers like Aipom, Doduo, and Meditite. Pokemon that struggle against Gloom and Tropius such as Corsola, Wartortle, and Chinchou greatly appreciate Koffing. Delcatty is a standout partner, as it complements Koffing with its special bulk, can keep Koffing healthy with Wish, and appreciates Koffing neutralizing Pokemon like Gloom, Tropius, and Meditite that could overwhelm it. Koffing's vulnerability to special attackers like Abra, Ponyta, and Quilava makes special walls like Porygon, Drowzee, and Noctowl great options to form defensve cores with Koffing, as they appreciate it taking on physical attackers like Seaking and Anorith. Offensive teammates like Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava love Koffing debilitating other offensive Pokemon so that they can more easily clean up weakened teams. Setup sweepers like Beedrill and Anorith are enabled by Koffing softening up teams for them, and they can take advantage of burned Pokemon for easier setup opportunities.</p>"

        "Sun Setter": {
          "description": "<p>Koffing works as a physically bulky sun setter, setting up in front of Pokemon such as Beedrill and Anorith that threaten other sun staples. Sludge Bomb is able to greatly pressure opposing Grass-types such as Tropius while also being able to discourage physically frail Pokemon like Abra from switching in. Hidden Power Grass is able to chunk threats like Rhyhorn, Corsola, and Seaking. Pain Split allows Koffing to stay healthy throughout the battle while potentially weakening other Pokemon. Explosion can turn Koffing into a sacrifice, potentially setting up a late-game closer like Tropius for victory. The EVs are invested into Defense to make Koffing a bulky physical wall, taking attacks like Double Edge from Ponyta and Doduo.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Tropius and Gloom are great partners for Koffing, being able to exploit the sun very well, while Gloom can also patch up Koffing's lower Special Defense. Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava also appreciate Koffing's sun-setting capabilities, being able to hit even harder with Fire Blast. Castform also benefits from the sun, nuking opposing Pokemon with Weather Ball. On the flip side, powerful special attackers along the lines of Abra can easily OHKO Koffing on the switch or in a one-on-one scenario. Opposing Ponyta and Quilava are also scary for Koffing, taking advantage of the sun and Koffing's lower Special Defense. Against these Pokemon, bulky Pokemon like specially defensive Mightyena and Noctowl work nicely. +1 Corsola is also really hard for Koffing to break through and take attacks from, even with the sun up and Hidden Power Grass. Chlorophyll users like Tropius and Gloom can deal with Corsola thanks to Solar Beam, although they must be weary of Ice Beam.</p>"

It can ruin boosting physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and Haze, so it is a great switch-in to Snorlax too. Finally, it gives Baton Pass chains a hard time as long as it isn't put to sleep or trapped and outstalled.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder are alternate attacking options that give Gyarados trouble while simultaneously hitting Skarmory. Shadow Ball can hit Dusclops and Gengar a bit harder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic is a great counter to Weezing as it can take advantage of poison or burn from Sludge Bomb and Will-O-Wisp with Marvel Scale. Other counters include Fire-types, who are immune to Will-O-Wisp; Houndoom in particular can hit Weezing with Pursuit as it switches out. Ghost-types such as Dusclops and Gengar stop Weezing cold as well. Skarmory can absorb Will-O-Wisp, set up Spikes, and Rest off the damage or be healed by Blissey or Celebi afterwards, but it needs to watch out for Flamethrower and Thunderbolt. Swellow can switch into Will-O-Wisp, activate Guts, and OHKO Weezing with a Choice Band Facade and some prior damage; Ursaring is even worse news with its huge base 130 Attack.</p>",

Steel- and Rock-types with Substitute might give Weezing problems here, but Flamethrower can deal with the former.</p> <p>The EV spread simply maximizes Weezing's HP and Defense to give it optimum physical bulk. Due to its low HP stat, Weezing gets more physical bulk by maximizing HP than by putting EVs into Defense. Thus, if you don't wish to maximize Defense, just use a lot of Defense EVs with a Defense-boosting nature, and put the rest in Attack or Special Attack.</p>"},

      "overview": "<p>Trapinch is actually not really a great Pokemon, but it has its uses, like everything. You could use Skarmory to lure Magneton, trap and kill it with Trapinch (needs prediction to work), then start Spiking away with Skarmory. It has a decent shot at killing Blissey (as long as she doesn't have Counter or Ice Beam) as well, while Dugtrio needs Adamant for this. However, this thing also cannot switch in on anything that attacks, unless the enemy is paralyzed and is using an attack with low Base Power.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>This is where you say \"Hidden Power random\". Hidden Power Flying could kill Breloom or Heracross, but good luck surviving their hits.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're playing Trapinch with paralysis support, you'll want to bring it to about 99 Speed, which requires 176 EVs. This will ensure that the only Pokemon faster than Trapinch after they are paralyzed are Ninjask (who will never ever be paralyzed, anyway, if you are playing a decent player) and Electrode (who will, in the unlikely event that it is paralyzed, almost certainly Explode immediately after you manage to paralyze it), so, for all intents and purposes, Trapinch will be faster than any paralyzed opponent. Otherwise, Speed is mostly irrelevant on Trapinch, as it is second only to Shuckle for the rank of slowest Pokemon in the game. The remaining EVs for a Trapinch based around paralysis, therefore, should be something resembling 80 HP, 252 Attack, 176 Speed, Adamant. This is, interestingly enough, the exact point in HP after which Trapinch is best optimized by splitting defenses while pumping HP--at or below 80 HP EVs, you want to only invest in HP to optimize defenses, but after it, you'll want to invest in HP, Defense, and Special Defense.</p> <p>172 HP, 40 Defense, and 44 Special Defense EVs will optimize Trapinch's defensive stats with the EVs leftover after maxing Attack. This will make you 2HKOed by Tyranitar's Choice Band Hidden Power Bug or Rock Slide, 3HKOed by Heracross Choice Band or Guts activated Rock Slide, 2HKOed by non-Choice Band / Dragon Danced Tyranitar / Salamence Earthquake, and you'll usually survive Calm Mind Jirachi / Celebi Psychic if they don't invest in Special Attack EVs. If you want to make it guaranteed survival from Jirachi and Celebi (assuming they don't invest Special Attack), 152 HP and 104 Special Defense is the spread that guarantees survival and increases physical defensive abilities the most with the 256 EVs remaining after maxing Attack. If you want, you can lower Attack slightly to 232 EVs, and give Trapinch 28 HP and 248 Special Defense EVs, as this will guarantee survival from Modest Magneton Hidden Power Ice (and thus also guarantee survival from Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ice from any Magneton, Raikou, or other non-Zapdos Electric). This will, coincidentally, allow Trapinch to always survive one Modest 252 Special Attack EV Blissey Ice Beam with at least 2 HP remaining.</p> <p>Always give Trapinch an Adamant nature, it really needs it to help damage stuff, and it's the only one of Trapinch's stats that really benefits from a 10% increase.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hit it on the switch. You can't really counter a trapper since counters should be able to switch in, and if you're trapped by this thing you cannot switch (thanks Captain Obvious). Usually, after killing something (especially if it took damage), Trapinch becomes worthless for the rest of the match, and it'll be dead weight on the team it's on.</p>",

        "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This set can do some damage in normal play, and has an even easier time in UU. You can kill Hidden Power Fire Magneton with it, and with some Special Defense EVs it can survive an Alakazam Psychic and Earthquake back for the KO. Or with more Defense investment, survive Metagross Meteor Mash and kill it. Further, you can come in on very low HP Pokemon, especially those Flail / Reversal Pokemon, and kill them with Quick Attack. If you use another Quick Attacker for this, you will find they will switch out and come back later to kill something. But against Trapinch, no switching is allowed unless said Pokemon is a Flying type or has Levitate. Hidden Power Bug is for the OHKO on Celebi--if you can switch this in on Recover, Heal Bell or something, you will survive Psychic and kill it.</p>"},

  "Flygon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Flygon is a decent Pokemon thanks to its offensive and defensive traits that suit the metagame well. For one, its incredible typing and ability provide a resistance to Rock and immunities to sand, Spikes, and Electric- and Ground-type attacks. These traits improve longevity and make it one of, if not the, best counter to Dragon Dance Tyranitar in the entire tier and a good check to Hidden Power Grass Zapdos lacking Toxic, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. Its offenses are also quite good, as its Earthquake is strong enough to hit offensive Pokemon quite hard, and its coverage makes the majority of the offensive metagame think twice before coming in. This offensive prowess is furthered by Flygon's very good base 100 Speed, which lets it outspeed common Pokemon like Heracross, Metagross, some Zapdos variants, and bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar at +1. However, Flygon has some major shortcomings that prevent it from being considered a top-tier threat. While it has great defensive merit, its typing leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type coverage from the likes of Gengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, Blissey, and offensive Water-types. It also often relies on trapping support from Magneton and Pursuit Tyranitar, as Skarmory and Gengar are unfazed by Flygon and can use it to generate free turns. While it's quite strong, Pokemon like defensive Swampert, Skarmory, and Milotic are able to take Flygon's attacks and recover them off. Its matchup against most common Toxic + Sandstorm + Spikes teams featuring SkarmBliss cores requires quite a bit of support from Spikes and trapping due to those teams being able to take Flygon's hits easily and even use it for free turns. Flygon also faces stiff competition from Swampert; despite Flygon being Spikes immune and not having to worry about being lured in and removed by sets like Hidden Power Grass Zapdos and Jolteon, Swampert's typing and greater bulk let it answer a lot more of the overall metagame and make it easier to fit on teams. As a result, Flygon is a more specialized, matchup-based pick in comparison.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ghost can be used to hit Gengar harder than any other move and does decent damage to Celebi, which makes Flygon less reliant on a Pursuit Tyranitar partner. However, this is all it does, and it's a more situational move than Hidden Power Bug on sets that run it. Hidden Power Flying can be used on teams that have issues dealing with Heracross. However, this is all it does, and Heracross can be pressured in other ways, usually via overloading it with offense. Hidden Power Grass or Giga Drain can be run on a special attacking set to lure in and take a large chunk out of Swampert and do more to Skarmory with fully invested Fire Blast. However, this usually isn't very effective because Flygon's Special Attack stat is quite mediocre, Swampert can heal off Giga Drain over time anyway, and having a weaker Earthquake hurts the Tyranitar and Metagross matchups. A pinch Berry set utilizing Liechi Berry with Substitute or Salac Berry with Endure can be used to help give Flygon some extra cleaning ability late-game; a Salac Berry + Endure set can also act as a failsafe against fast Pokemon and setup sweepers, giving Flygon an extra hit before going down. However, this comes at the cost of the increased longevity granted by Leftovers, making Flygon a less reliable check to Rock-types. Pinch berry sets are hence most appropriate for short games.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert are able to take Flygon's hits well and threaten it out with strong Water- or Ice-type coverage. Defensive Swampert in particular is a fantastic answer, as, in tandem with being able to heal in sand with Leftovers and use Protect, it also isn't too bothered by Toxic due to Refresh. However, Suicune and Milotic are both vulnerable to sand, so Flygon's damage is going to stick, and Suicune lacks any recovery outside of Rest. Choice Band sets can also pressure all of these Pokemon if they directly switch in, especially in sand for the former two and if Spikes are down for all three of them. Offensive Swampert also takes a lot from Earthquake and is completely crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Earthquake, isn't hit that hard by any of Leftovers Flygon's moves depending on its physical bulk investment, and can OHKO Flygon with Ice Punch. It can also use Will-O-Wisp, crippling either Flygon or whatever switches into Gengar as Flygon gives Gengar a free turn. However, multiple Rock Slide in sand can start to sting from Leftovers Flygon, and Choice Band sets do a ton of damage, leaving Gengar unable to fulfill other potential defensive duties throughout the game. Gengar is also very vulnerable to Pursuit Tyranitar, a common Flygon partner.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon Flygon is typically meant to counter or at least check, like Tyranitar, Zapdos, and Jolteon, are all able to potentially lure it in and take it out with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice. However, these moves can be scouted with smart play. Ice-type coverage can also be seen on other Pokemon like Jirachi, Porygon2, Starmie, and Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 is able to come into Flygon thanks to copying Levitate with Trace, taking little damage from Flygon's coverage options, and having longevity thanks to Recover. It's also able to use Ice Beam on Flygon to take it out and can cripple potential switch-ins with Thunder Wave. While Toxic is a good stop to it in most cases, Porygon2 can trace a Natural Cure user to heal the poison. However, Porygon2 gives free turns to common Flygon partners, namely Spikers, especially when Porygon2 has to recover.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp on Pokemon like Moltres and especially Gengar makes Flygon have to switch out, as burns remove any offensive threat it may have while chipping it beyond what Leftovers heals. Toxic poison ruins Flygon, as it forces Flygon out more often and makes it take constant chip damage so it can't counter or check what it's meant to. This is compounded on when Protect users are on the opposing team, which they very often are. Paralysis from Body Slam Jirachi means Flygon is outsped by the entire metagame.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory doesn't take much from any attack Flygon has besides Fire Blast, and if it lacks said move, Skarmory is free to lay up Spikes in Flygon's face and take its attacks with ease. However, Fire Blast will sting Skarmory, and Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide can do some noticeable damage. It also doesn't help Magneton can easily be employed to remove it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Flygon sports a unique combination of speed, power, and defensive utility. Its unique typing, Spikes immunity, and decent bulk allow it to pivot into threatening attacks like Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Zapdos's Thunderbolt at any point in the game, making Flygon one of the few Pokemon that can turn the momentum around against offensive teams. It can be difficult to pivot into, because it punishes physical walls with its powerful Earthquake especially with Spikes on the field and has the appropriate coverage moves for hovering checks. As Flygon outspeeds most of the metagame and can hold its ground against several faster Pokemon like Hidden Power Grass Jolteon and Aerodactyl, it can frequently sweep weakened teams too.</p> <p>Earthquake can take out most Tyranitar and Metagross variants with a little bit of chip damage. Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Gyarados hard while also doing relatively solid damage to Gengar as it switches in. Hidden Power Bug does a lot of damage to Celebi and hits Claydol quite hard, preventing these common switch-ins from being totally safe, and also preventing Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi from freely passing boosts. Substitute is preferred in the fourth moveslot, as it punishes switches and certain Choiced-locked Pokemon, lets Flygon evade status from status spreaders like Zapdos and Milotic, and allows it to fire off at least one free attack. Fire Blast can be run over Substitute if Skarmory and Forretress are a bigger concern and denies them from setting up Spikes, which helps against Spikes-centric builds and makes Flygon less reliant on a potential Magneton partner while also doing decent damage to Gengar and Celebi on the switch. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Timid Moltres and offensive Celebi and at worst Speed tie with Zapdos and Jirachi rather than risk being outsped. An Adamant nature lets Flygon threaten the bulky teams it's supposed to more effectively but makes it unable to outspeed a large fraction of offensive Celebi and tie with offensive Jirachi, making it an overall inferior choice on most teams. When using Fire Blast, Naive and Naughty should be used over Jolly and Adamant to preserve the much needed power on Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar is a fantastic partner because it brings sand to wear down Pokemon like Zapdos, Snorlax, Suicune, Celebi, and Gengar so Flygon's damage sticks while also trapping the aforementioned Gengar, which is a massive nuisance to this set, and it can even slam Swampert with Hidden Power Grass so Flygon can more easily take it out. Magneton is another good partner, as it traps Skarmory, Forretress, and Choice Band Metagross not locked into Earthquake, which is a move that Flygon can dissuade thanks to Levitate, so Flygon can more easily threaten teams that rely on Skarmory for handling Ground-types and drop Fire Blast for Substitute more reliably. In return, Flygon can force Skarmory and Forretress to come in so Magneton can come in on a double switch to trap them, as well as handle Tyranitar and come in on many Choice Band Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to take out Magneton, like Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Spikes setters like Skarmory and Forretress are great to have, as they make Flygon's attacks sting even more, especially since some of Flygon's best answers, namely Milotic, Swampert, and Blissey, are very vulnerable to Spikes and Spikes synergize well in tandem with the sand likely to be up. These two also bring some much-needed defensive stops to Pokemon like non-Hidden Power Fire Metagross and physical Salamence. This Flygon is also able to threaten spinners like Claydol and opposing Forretress if it has Fire Blast, keeping the Spikes up and letting the Spikes setter on Flygon's team come in less often, helping it stay healthy to check what it needs to. Flygon is also able to wall Pokemon like Aerodactyl and physical Tyranitar in tandem with these Pokemon because they bait Rock Slide from these and let Flygon get safely in, compensating for its lack of bulk. Flygon can even force in a potential Porygon2 so the Spiker can set Spikes on it. Gengar makes for a good partner, since it can spread residual damage through Will-O-Wisp burns and check Salamence, Heracross, and Snorlax while taking advantage of Flygon checking Pursuit Tyranitar lacking Ice Beam. It can even take advantage of the holes Flygon breaks in the opposing team to sweep late-game, and it even fits on many of the same Spikes-based teams that this Flygon is meant to be on. They can also both pivot around many Pokemon with their defensive synergy, namely Choice Band users and weakened Hidden Power Grass Zapdos.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert are able to switch into physical attackers like Metagross, MixMence, and Swampert and potentially even spread status for residual damage, while Flygon can break down their checks with its powerful attacks, namely Celebi, Zapdos, Snorlax, and Jolteon. Defensive Swampert, in particular, is a good partner because it can take the pressure off Flygon to handle physical Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, which can often overwhelm this Flygon set due to its lack of bulk investment and Protect. It also helps that all three of these Water-types fit on the same Spikes-based builds Flygon does. Zapdos is able to take on Water-types, Skarmory, Heracross, and spread status so Flygon can have an easier time making damage stick while even having the potential to run Baton Pass to get Flygon in safely. Flygon can also switch into Rock Slides for Zapdos to gain offensive momentum and potentially do a lot of damage to Pokemon like Snorlax and Celebi so Zapdos has an easier time spamming Thunderbolt late-game while also acting as backup Ground-type check so Zapdos isn't as pressured to come into them. Metagross is a great partner for this Flygon because it can elect to run a mixed or bulky physical attacker Leftovers set if Flygon is running Fire Blast, which can help to lure in and remove Skarmory, and more bulk on Metagross means Flygon is relied on less to take on Rock-types. Meanwhile, Choice Band sets can use Explosion on Skarmory or Swampert and wallbreak so Flygon can clean through weakened walls.</p> <p>Specially defensive Celebi is able to handle Gengar and Water-types while piling on the residual damage to get Pokemon in range of Flygon's attacks with Leech Seed (which can also give Flygon extra longevity that it wouldn't have), while Flygon can offensively handle Metagross and pivot into Rock Slide, Earthquake, or Hidden Power Bug from Aerodactyl or Tyranitar well. Blissey can pivot into many special attackers, including Zapdos, Jolteon, Jirachi, Moltres, certain Gengar variants, and Water-types, while even potentially passing Wishes to keep Flygon healthy so it can threaten the bulky teams it's supposed to. Meanwhile, Flygon can offensively handle Pokemon that wall and use Blissey for free turns, like Tyranitar, as well as come in on some resisted hits that are often targeted at Blissey, namely Rock Slide and Earthquake, to get a chance to fire off a free hit. Moltres can roast Skarmory, Celebi, and Forretress and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp for residual damage so Flygon's damage sticks better, while Flygon can switch into physical Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and Salamence and start wallbreaking on top of wearing down Water-types with its powerful Earthquake so they're more hesitant to come into Moltres. Moltres also improves the Metagross matchup quite a bit, which teams featuring Flygon over Swampert can often struggle switching into due to Flygon's lack of a Meteor Mash resistance.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Flygon is a good Spikes-immune check to common threats like physical Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, and Electric-types lacking Hidden Power Ice or Toxic. It also bolsters the team's resilience against Metagross and Dragon Dance Salamence.</p> <p>Protect allows Flygon to receive a free turn of Leftovers recovery, scout Choice Band users, and rack up potential poison and sand damage. Rock Slide gives nearly perfect coverage in tandem with Earthquake and hits Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, and Aerodactyl hard while also not giving Gengar entirely free entry, wearing it down over time. Fire Blast can be used if getting good damage on Skarmory and Forretress and relying less on Magneton to handle them is preferred, but it's usually better to just pair this set with Magneton because Rock Slide's coverage is too valuable to pass up on a lot of the time. Toxic cripples Pokemon like non-Refresh Swampert, Zapdos, Porygon2, Suicune, non-Refresh Claydol, and opposing Flygon. It also forces Celebi to switch at some point to remove poison, which can give you a free turn as it switches. The EVs let Flygon outspeed maximum Speed positive-natured Tyranitar, allow it to survive two hits from Metagross, help it take Tyranitar's uninvested Ice Beam, and help it handle physical attackers as well as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar is this set's best partner, as its sand is important to negate Leftovers from many foes, namely defensive Zapdos, Gengar, Celebi, and Suicune. Pursuit trapping Gengar and Celebi so Flygon can more effectively spread poison with Toxic is absolutely crucial as well, and Tyranitar can even lure in and destroy Swampert, Skarmory, Forretress, and Claydol with the appropriate coverage. Physical sets are able to check and take out Blissey, Ice Punch Jirachi, and Hidden Power Ice Zapdos. In return, Flygon can pivot into Earthquakes from Pokemon like Claydol and Tyranitar while also being able to pivot around Electric-types and Aerodactyl in tandem with Tyranitar, as they can wall Zapdos and Jolteon when played properly.</p> <p>Gengar makes for a good partner, as it can spread residual damage through Will-O-Wisp burns and threaten bulkier teams that Flygon struggles with via Taunt + Will-O-Wisp sets while also taking out Skarmory and taking advantage of Flygon checking Pursuit Tyranitar lacking Ice Beam. They can also both pivot around many Pokemon with their defensive synergy, namely Choice Band users and weakened Hidden Power Grass Zapdos and are both Spikes immune, making them fit on similar structures. Skarmory can set Spikes to help Flygon get lasting damage on the opposing team as a lot of Flygon's defensive answers, like Milotic, Swampert, and Blissey, are very vulnerable to Spikes and will likely be taking damage from sand and Toxic poison from Flygon too. Skarmory also provides a switch-in to Pokemon like Snorlax lacking Fire Blast and defensive Swampert. In return, Flygon can take on Electric-types like Zapdos and Jolteon as well as scout Fire-type coverage from Pokemon that run it, namely Metagross, Salamence, and Tyranitar. Flygon even poisons Spikes-immune Pokemon like Claydol, Zapdos, and Moltres with Toxic.</p> <p>Flygon fits very well on teams that have many Spikes-immune Pokemon to minimize the control Spikes have on the game, reducing the need for Magneton support in the process. With these things in mind, Zapdos is a great partner because it's able to take on Water-types, Skarmory, and Heracross and spread its own status in tandem with Flygon while contributing to the anti-Spikes idea this Flygon often fits on so well. Moltres improves the Metagross matchup quite a bit, which these teams can often struggle switching into due to Flygon's lack of a Meteor Mash resistance, while Flygon can spread poison with Toxic on bulky Water-types and pivot into Rock- and Electric-types well. Specially defensive Jirachi can take Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Gengar, opposing Jirachi, and Suicune, which these teams can sometimes struggle to take, and passes Flygon and its other teammates Wish to keep sustain throughout the game. This is especially important given many Pokemon on these teams can't recover with Leftovers due to being vulnerable to sand. It can even potentially spread paralysis or Toxic poison of its own to suffocate the opposing team in tandem with Flygon. In return, Flygon switches into Earthquakes and strong physical attackers that may overwhelm Jirachi on its own. Plus, most synergistic specially defensive cores in ADV cover Electric-types and Water-types, so the combination of Flygon + Zapdos + Jirachi makes a good specially defensive core without having a dedicated special wall. They can also wall Zapdos completely in tandem with each other because Jirachi handles Hidden Power Ice variants and Flygon stonewalls Thunder Wave variants, as they run Hidden Power Grass. Aerodactyl takes advantage of the residual damage Flygon spreads to make late-game sweeps more easily accomplished while providing these teams with a good form of speed control and even being Spikes and sand immune, making it fit on these structures even better.</p> <p>Specially defensive Celebi is able to handle Gengar and Water-types while piling on the residual damage in tandem with Flygon with Leech Seed, while Flygon can handle weakened Metagross and pivot into Aerodactyl. Blissey can pivot into many special attackers, including Zapdos, Jolteon, Jirachi, Moltres, certain Gengar variants, and Water-types, in a similar way to Celebi. It can even potentially pass Wishes to keep Flygon healthy. Meanwhile, Flygon can pressure and potentially force out physical attackers that scare Blissey, like Metagross, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar. Zapdos is able to take on Water-types, Skarmory, Heracross, and spread its own status in tandem with Flygon.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Flygon is a wallbreaker that can easily get onto the field due to its unique typing and its immunity to Spikes and Sand. It boasts the strongest Earthquake in the metagame, severely threatening even the most resilient physical walls.</p> <p>Earthquake OHKOes some Tyranitar and Metagross variants from full thanks to Choice Band, takes out pretty much all of them after a layer of Spikes, and gets good damage on Suicune and Milotic, especially if sand is up. Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Moltres, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Gengar, and Gyarados really hard. Hidden Power Bug smashes Celebi and hits Claydol really hard, preventing these common switch-ins from being safe with proper prediction. Gust takes out Heracross and Breloom, which teams with this Flygon set often have a very rough matchup against. Alternatively, Toxic cripples Porygon2, offensive Swampert, Zapdos, and Moltres and makes them incapable of coming in as safely or staying in for long periods of time. Fire Blast can also be run to hit Skarmory and Forretress and denies them from setting up Spikes; it also does decent damage to Gengar and forces Celebi to use Recover. A Jolly nature is preferred because it lets Flygon outspeed Timid Moltres and offensive Celebi and at worst Speed tie with Zapdos and Jirachi rather than risk being outsped. However, Adamant is better for some teams, as it allows Flygon to threaten the bulky teams it's supposed to more effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar is an essential partner, as it brings sand to wear down Pokemon like Zapdos, Snorlax, Suicune, Celebi, and Gengar so Flygon's damage sticks while also trapping Gengar and Celebi and even threatening Zapdos with a potential Ice Beam so Flygon can begin to more freely throw around Earthquakes. It can even slam Swampert with Hidden Power Grass so Flygon can more easily take it out later in the game with Earthquake. Magneton is another almost mandatory partner, as it traps Skarmory and Forretress, two Pokemon that can take Flygon's attacks with ease and use it for free turns. Flygon can force Skarmory and Forretress to come in so Magneton can come in on a double switch to trap them. Conversely, Flygon can come in on many Choice Band Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to take out Magneton like Metagross, Aerodactyl, Salamence, and Tyranitar. If Magneton is not used as a partner, other measures of dealing with Skarmory's Spikes will be necessary. Forretress is great partner in this regard not only because of its ability to spin and lay its own Spikes, but also because it synergizes with Pursuit Tyranitar.</p> <p>Skarmory acts as a more reliable answer to Rock-types, Salamence, and Celebi while also setting Spikes so Flygon can wallbreak even more effectively. It's often worth running Drill Peck on the types of teams this Flygon fits on, as they're often weak to Heracross, which Flygon can sometimes have a tendency to let come in. Flygon is able to take on Electric-types relatively well in return while even doing a ton of damage to the spinners of the tier, so Spikes are likelier to stay up. Specially defensive Celebi is able to handle Gengar and Water-types while netting residual damage to get Pokemon in range of Flygon's attacks with Leech Seed, which can also give Flygon extra longevity that it wouldn't have, while Flygon can offensively handle Metagross and pivot into Rock Slide, Earthquake, or Hidden Power Bug from Aerodactyl or Tyranitar well. It also fits on many of the Spikes-based builds this set does.</p> <p>Metagross is able to run a bulkier Protect set to handle Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Salamence, and Aerodactyl, as Flygon is unable to handle these Pokemon reliably due to lacking Leftovers. Milotic works well on the same builds this Flygon can, stops non-Choice Band Salamence, Claydol, Tyranitar, and Skarmory, and forces Suicune to use Rest, while Flygon threatens Snorlax, Celebi, and Zapdos for it. It can even come in on Rock Slide from Tyranitar, which Milotic often encourages it to do for free damage. Suicune can do largely the same thing as Milotic except it gives up reliability in countering threats in the long run for more initial bulk and more of an offensive presence. Defensive Swampert is a particularly good partner, as it can take the pressure off Flygon to handle Rock-types, which can overwhelm this Flygon set due to its lack of bulk investment and Leftovers; it can even wall Electric-types in tandem with Flygon, as they can take the Hidden Power the other can't. Because of this more reliable backbone and decreased offensive pressure, Flygon is able to come in more sparingly throughout games and keep healthy so it can be a threat in the long run.</p>"

Lileep also has Recover to continuously counter Pidgeotto, while Rhyhorn can be problematic for Pidgeotto's team if Pidgeotto gives it a free turn of setup.

          "description": "<p>Pidgeotto stands out as a great physical wallbreaker thanks to its great STAB moves in Double-Edge and Aerial Ace, which can 2HKO common walls such as Dustox, Delcatty, and Bayleef, and its good speed tier outpacing Pokemon such as Butterfree, Castform, and Chinchou. Pidgeotto faces competition from another Normal / Flying type, Taillow, who has a better Speed and a useful ability in Guts. However, Pidgeotto has better attack and bulk. It also avoids OHKOs from walls such as Dustox and Delcatty after Double-Edge recoil, as well as outright OHKOs from powerful attacks such Double-Edge from non-Choice Band Aipom and Castform, and Aerial Ace from Choice Band Delibird. Return can be used over Double-Edge to help Pidgeotto stay healthy, but it will be harder to get targets into KO range. STAB Quick Attack revenge kills faster Pokemon such as Aipom, Elekid, and Delibird. Hidden Power Fighting can threaten Pokemon that don't mind Pidgeotto's STAB combination such as Rhyhorn, Magnemite, and specially defensive Lileep. Steel Wing can be used to ease prediction versus Shuppet, or if you are using Hidden Power Flying over Aerial Ace for the power. Here, Steel Wing lets Pidgeotto still threaten Rock-types like specially defensive Lileep and Nosepass. However, without a super effective Hidden Power, Pidgeotto cannot threaten to 2HKO Steel-Types such as Magnemite.</p> <p>Pidgeotto fits very well on balance and offense teams as a wallbreaker. It can remove Pokemon such as Delcatty, Dustox, and Bayleef, which can open up teammates such as Elekid, Staryu, and Rhyhorn. Pidgeotto appreciates Spikes support from Snorunt and Pineco, which helps chip Pokemon like Elekid and Aipom into Quick Attack range over time. Spikes also allows Pidgeotto to 2HKO Pokemon it normally can't like bulky variants of Rhyhorn. Special walls such as Chinchou and Delcatty are excellent checks to faster special attackers such as Elekid and Staryu, with Delcatty also offering cleric support if Pidgeotto gets burned by Pokemon such as Koffing. Rock-types such as Rhyhorn and Nosepass can switch into Aipom and Taillow's STAB moves as they try to revenge kill Pidgeotto. Nosepass has the added benefit of trapping Magnemite, a common Pidgeotto check. Also, Pidgeotto's Grass resistance also helps Rock-types versus Pokemon such as Bayleef and Butterfree. Special attackers such as Elekid and Spoink can remove physical walls such as Rhyhorn, Magnemite, and Koffing, which allows Pidgeotto to use its STAB moves without being punished.</p>"

    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Raticate stands out as the fastest unboosted attacker in the tier (not counting the irrelevant Voltorb) and is an extremely potent offensive threat on teams built with the focus of sweeping with it. Apart from its Speed, which places it just above the base 95 Speed tier occupied primarily by Plusle and Haunter, it boasts a great STAB type in Normal, decent coverage options, a great ability that can take its threat level to 11, and enough flexibility to keep its opponents on their toes the second it makes its presence known. The only major downside to bringing Raticate is that nearly every team is going to be naturally prepared for it, whether that be through the near-omnipresence of Hitmonchan in the tier or through the presence of physically bulky checks to it like Sableye and Relicanth. Regardless, Raticate's deadliness is undeniable, and it's definitely worth consideration for building a team around.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Silk Scarf can be used in place of Choice Band, which can be great for bluffing; Double-Edge packs about as much power, and Raticate can switch moves. However, Raticate loses a ton of power on its other moves, which may or may not be worth it, depending on your team.</p> <p>As a Normal-type, Raticate has quite the expansive movepool, but almost none of it is worth using due to Raticate's stats. Substitute can be used with Silk Scarf, which can help with predicting and protects Raticate from Thunder Wave. Super Fang is an option on any Raticate set, and when used with Substitute it turns Raticate into a decent stallbreaker; unfortunately, Raticate's would-be main target, Sableye, is immune to it. Finally, Thunder Wave and Toxic are options to weaken some of Raticate's main checks, including Sableye and Relicanth.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Haunter is immune to basically every one of Raticate's moves apart from Shadow Ball, meaning it'll generally have a safe switch into Raticate and at worst will be able to easily revenge kill the Choice Band set. Steel- and Rock-types resist Raticate's STAB moves and can usually tank Hidden Power Ground, even when it's Guts-boosted, although they must all be wary of the Reversal set. Hitmonchan easily OHKOes Raticate with Mach Punch, but it cannot safely switch into most of Raticate's moves. Swalot checks the Choice Band set and almost completely walls the Reversal set, but it must be wary of accidentally giving Raticate a Guts boost. Defensive Tangela can easily tank anything from either set but isn't strong enough to 2HKO in return, so be careful when using it.</p>",

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Raticate is the fastest Choice Band user in the tier, and it is still just as strong as Pidgeot, cementing it as an undeniably scary offensive presence in the tier. With just Double-Edge, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Ground, Raticate covers every Pokemon in the tier that it needs to, meaning the last moveslot will mostly be filler. Quick Attack is probably the most useful of Raticate's options, protecting it from getting picked off by a weakened Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and weakened weather sweepers like Bellossom and Huntail. Facade is another option that becomes stronger than Double-Edge without the recoil should you be able to switch Raticate into a Toxic, which also powers up Raticate's other moves thanks to Guts.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to outpace the base 95 Speed tier, which includes dangerous threats such as Plusle and Haunter, both of which Raticate OHKOes with the appropriate move. Super Fang is a good option for the last slot to spread around damage on the opponent's team if you can support Raticate well enough to get in and out quickly, and it is Raticate's best option for wearing down Relicanth and Mawile. However, Super Fang should only be used if you can expect to be able to switch Raticate out immediately, as being locked into Super Fang can create clear setup opportunities for dangerous threats like Huntail.</p> <p>When playing with Raticate, do all in your power to switch it into a Toxic to activate Guts, which takes Raticate from a moderately dangerous, semi-truck of an attacker to a nuclear-warhead-attached-to-a-wrecking-ball-being-launched-off-a-rocket sweeping powerhouse. This requires playing a bit riskily and predicting your opponent heavily, but the reward is worth the risk tenfold, and when playing against stall-centric teams, where Toxic is most likely to get thrown at your team, the risk level for playing hard and fast with Raticate is usually pretty low.</p> <p>Haunter is immune to three of the four moves on this set, so you need to bring a decent switch-in to it when using Choice Band Raticate, preferably something very specially bulky like Flareon or Chimecho. Spikes support is exceptionally good with this set as well, as nearly every check or counter to Raticate, apart from Haunter, is grounded, making Glalie and Roselia good teammates to lead off the team with. Rock- and Steel-types easily tank even a Guts-boosted Facade, making Water- and Grass-types good offensive teammates to bring with and wallbreak for Raticate. Finally, physically defensive Swalot and Lickitung can tank a Double-Edge from full health, making other physical attackers like Piloswine good teammates to bring with Raticate as well.</p>"

        "Reversal": {
          "description": "<p>The idea of this set is pretty simple; get Raticate down to 1 HP and unleash hell the likes of which your opponent has never seen. The best way to accomplish this is to bring Raticate in on something that can likely OHKO it, like Hitmonchan without Mach Punch, use Substitute during the proceeding attacks or Endure the hit, and attack with Reversal from 1 HP, which after a Liechi Berry boost OHKOes even fully physically defensive Relicanth, and watch as your opponent's team just crumbles before you. This set is best used late-game so that switching Raticate in on something that will likely annihilate it doesn't look as suspicious. The choice between Substitute and Endure comes down to personal preference and your team build: if you are positive you can keep Spikes off the field or won't have to switch Raticate in on anything to eat a hit, using Substitute is probably the safer option; if you are confident in your prediction skills and don't want to have to accommodate for Rapid Spin on your team, Endure is probably the better option.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is needed so that Haunter, Chimecho, and Sableye don't just completely wall this set. The choice between Quick Attack and Return is tough. Quick Attack is a better option than any other STAB move apart from Return because a full-powered Reversal is nearly as strong as a full-powered Facade (which is hard to use on this set considering if Raticate is poisoned or burned, it won't be at 1 HP for long, and if it's paralyzed it's too slow to sweep anyway). Quick Attack also protects Raticate from Mach Punch and other Quick Attacks thrown its way. Return is still an option if having a strong STAB move when not at 1 HP is desired, and Return is Raticate's best option for Poison-types if you're scared of your opponent packing an Arbok or Swalot.</p> <p>Liechi Berry with a Jolly nature is the main option due to the fact that Raticate is the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier when Jolly, meaning a Speed boost from Salac Berry will usually be unwarranted. Salac Berry does have its use when used with an Adamant nature, as Raticate is then able to hit slightly harder when unboosted as well as outspeed Sunny Day Bellossom and Rain Dance Huntail once boosted. However, Raticate loses a ton of power without the Liechi Berry boost.</p> <p>Endeavor is an option on the set as well in place of Quick Attack, which can bring any one Pokemon down to 1 HP before Raticate goes down itself. This will rarely be helpful, but if you're unable to remove the opponent's Swalot, this will be Raticate's best option to help the rest of team. Taunt can be used to force the opponent into attacking Raticate and activating its Berry, which eliminates any mind games the opponent can play with you and prevents Raticate from getting hit by status, but if the opponent attacks the turn Raticate uses Taunt and OHKOes it, all will have been for naught.</p> <p>Physically defensive Swalot is about the only major block to this set, making Chimecho and Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates. Diglett deserves a special mention for basically ensuring Swalot is removed or at least weakened enough for Raticate to break through. Physically defensive Whiscash and Wailord can tank a +1 Reversal, meaning Grass-types are good partners as well to eliminate or weaken them before sweeping. Defensive Pelipper is another good check to Raticate, making Plusle a good teammate (and Hidden Power Grass Plusle will blow past Whiscash as well). Finally, Venomoth and defensive Tangela can check this set as well, making Flareon a good teammate.</p>"

It resists Rock Slide from Tyranitar and Aerodactyl pretty well, you may want to try it out sometime.</p> <p>In UU, Sandslash is a monster. It rivals Quagsire and Gligar as the best Ground around. It can 2HKO Quagsire and Blastoise with a Swords Dance, and if Gligar comes in on a Swords Dance it can take it out one on one, barring Toxic. Its great Defense and the use of Hidden Power Ghost or Rock makes it an alright Solrock switch-in (though Reflect will be annoying), and it can hurt its counters quite well. Be aware of Sandslash's great sweeping powers, whether you're using it or not.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A great example in standard is Snorlax: try coming in on a Curse. Snorlax might be afraid you're going to Swords Dance up on him and will try to attack you, and a Counter will put a big dent into him. It will also be of great use against Choice Banders such as Salamence in standard or Fearow in UU.</p> <p>You can use Rest for that, but Sandslash may have a hard time surviving this without Heal Bell or Aromatherapy somewhere on your team. Same for UU, except that is even more fast-paced. Protect can be handy for lingering Toxic, gaining Leftovers recovery and scouting for Explosion or Choice Banded moves.</p> <p>Focus Punch can come handy if Skarmory comes in on your Swords Dance, but usually it will not hurt anything more than Earthquake and Rock Slide together will. Flail simply doesn't work well as Sandslash doesn't have STAB on it and isn't fast enough to pull it off. Hidden Power Ghost hits Gengar and Misdreavus harder than Rock Slide, and still puts a dent into Celebi, Solrock and Lunatone, and Hidden Power Flying is an awesome option to scare Heracross and Breloom, and it still hits Celebi, so it's pretty useful when you're using this guy in standard. Sandslash makes an average Sleep Talker thanks to his great defense, but you'll be wasting his awesome Swords Dance potential, and the most common Sleep moves come from Milotic, Jynx and Grass-types, none of which Sandslash likes to face.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>It outspeeds Blastoise with no Speed EVs, with the recommended spread, as well as anything slower (Hypno, Solrock, and anything else with 70 base or lower). You'll generally want a ton of Attack, with the rest of the EVs in HP.</p> <p>If you're using Counter, you may want to take EVs from Attack and Speed and put them into HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Its biggest weakness is that it's slow and doesn't take special hits very well, but most special attackers do not take his Earthquakes that easily either.</p> <p>In standard, Skarmory walls Sandslash to an extent. Toxic will mess it up badly, Spikes will hurt the team and Roar and Whirlwind negate Swords Dance. However, Sandslash can also Rapid Spin off the Spikes, and hit Skarmory with a Swords Danced Focus Punch, or try to wear it down with Rock Slide (Swords Danced Rock Slide does about 40%). Suicune, Milotic and Swampert can OHKO with Surf or Hydro Pump, and their high HP and Defense will be troublesome in the early stages. If their health falls below 50%, however, a Swords Danced Earthquake will kill all three of them (except a Bold max Defense max HP Suicune, who has a chance to survive). Salamence and Gyarados can be a pain with Intimidate and immunity to Earthquake, but unless they're using a Special Attack like Hydro Pump, Sandslash can just Swords Dance on the switch and beat them with Rock Slide. Claydol is immune to Earthquake and resists Rock Slide, and usually packs Toxic or a super effective Ice Beam, however he is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug without Swords Dance. Zapdos and Raikou, as well as other Special Attackers that outspeed Sandslash, can come in on a non-attacking move or after Sandslash killed something to finish it off.</p> <p>In UU, a Gligar with Counter or Toxic can mess up Sandslash somewhat, and Quagsire, Blastoise and Walrein can hold the boat to the same extent Suicune, Milotic and Swampert can in standard. Solrock can Reflect up and Lunatone can use Ice Beam, but they should beware of Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug. Any STAB Water, Grass or Ice attack will (nearly) kill Sandslash. Meganium makes a great counter with Giga Drain, Razor Leaf or Hidden Power Grass, perhaps in company of Reflect and / or Leech Seed, but once again watch out for Hidden Power Bug. Make sure to use Synthesis to keep it alive.</p>",

Take note of how much damage you do. When they take two more hits to finish off, Swords Dance on the switch, then take them out.</p>"},
        "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Return helps to 2HKO most Gligar, but that's the only Pokemon it's hitting, so Rapid Spin is an option if you really want to get rid of Spikes. Don't use this set in OU, however, because Donphan outclasses it there.</p>"},
        "Counter": {
          "description": "<p>This set is designed to specifically counter some of the biggest threats in the UU metagame, while still being able to get most of the 2HKOs and OHKOs that it needs to. Counter is a great addition to the sweeper set, as it allows Sandslash to destroy many of the Grass-type Pokemon which normally stop it, since their strongest move is Hidden Power Grass, which can be Countered. The basic strategy is to bring Sandslash in on a weak physical attack such as Rock Slide, or any Electric attack. Swords Dance on the switch and then start sweeping. This set allows you to take out Blastoise, Walrein, and Meganium - all common switch-ins to Sandslash -and continue sweeping what you can. Greedy Gligars also get taken out it they try to KO with only +2 or +4 Atk (depending on EVs and nature of the Gligar).</p> <p>Another bonus is that with the 252 HP EVs, and 36 SpD EVs you always survive various STAB Surfs and Ice Beams, while being faster and being able to 2HKO. For example, you can Swords Dance on your opponent's switch to Walrein or Blastoise, and then hit it for a 2HKO with Rock Slide (only on Walrein) or Earthquake, and live through the Surf / Ice Beam to hit them for the KO. Additionally, Sandslash will always survive a Timid Manectric's Hidden Power even after a Petaya boost, as well as almost always surviving a Timid Electabuzz's Ice Punch after a Petaya boost.</p> <p>Rock Slide is the preferred move in the 4th slot, because it has the flinch rate, and Sandslash is able to outspeed most walls. It also allows Sandslash to take out fliers and Levitators that would not take themselves out with Counter, such as Misdreavus and Xatu, but more importantly, Altaria (which is outsped by this variant of Sandslash, allowing you to Rock Slide and possibly flinch before you get hit with Haze or Perish Song). Furthermore, it helps with Scyther and Yanma, not allowing them to set up while you try to Counter. Hidden Power Bug hits Grass types that do not attack with Hidden Power Grass, such as Bellosom and Tangela, and can hit Meganium hard if it uses Light Screen or Leech Seed. Hidden Power Bug also hits Solrock / Lunatone for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ghost, on the other hand, hits not only the previously mentioned Lunatone / Solrock for super effective damage, but also Misdreavus and Xatu as well. Counter takes care of Fearow, so it is not a big trouble if it walls those two attacks. It should be noted, however, that Rock Slide does have lower accuracy than Hidden Power</p>"

STAB-boosted Sludge Bomb is incredibly dangerous to switch into for non Steel- or Poison-type Pokemon due to its high chance to inflict poison. Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon, most notably Rhyhorn and Cubone, are dissuaded from switching in because of the poison chance due to their tendency to use Substitute. Return provides Nidorino with an option against opposing Poison-types that may attempt to switch in such as Dustox, Grimer, and Koffing. Hidden Power Fighting allows Nidorino to threaten Steel-type Pokemon like Aron and Magnemite. Facade allows Nidorino to deal some semblance of damage even after being burned by Koffing. An Adamant nature is chosen to make use of Nidorino's fantastic Attack; using Jolly doesn't enable Nidorino to outspeed anything notable.</p> <p>Nidorino fits best on balance and offense teams that appreciate the likelihood of it spreading poison. Nidorino's access to Poison Point in conjunction with Sludge Bomb can open up opportunities for wallbreakers and setup sweepers by poisoning bulkier Pokemon. Other physical attackers such as Aipom, Rhyhorn, and Cubone appreciate Nidorino as a secondary wallbreaker. Due to its lacking Speed, Nidorino appreciates help from Thunder Wave users such as Nosepass, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Chinchou deserves a special mention, as it's able to threaten Koffing as well as Rock- and Ground-types that Nidorino can only hope to poison such as Rhyhorn and Cubone. Butterfree makes for a fantastic partner, as it's able to remove Koffing with Psychic and use Sleep Powder against Pokemon that would otherwise threaten Nidorino such as Chinchou. Nidorino struggles against special attackers, so specially defensive Pokemon such as Castform, Dustox, Delcatty, and Sunflora are integral for supporting it. Specially defensive Poison-types such as Dustox and Grimer are often forced to come in on Nidorino in fear of a Sludge Bomb, so special attackers such as Elekid and Chinchou appreciate Nidorino's ability to weaken them with its Normal coverage.</p>"

This makes it one of the best checks to the best Pokemon in the tier, Hitmonchan, given it is not running the uncommon Rock Slide. Golbat's base 80 Attack is decent, especially given its powerful physical STAB attack in Sludge Bomb. However, Golbat struggles to deal with the multiple good Rock-types that are in the tier. It also struggles with Steel-types, especially Mawile, as it forces Golbat to predict with Hidden Power Ground and even then can become setup fodder that allows Mawile to Baton Pass to a teammate.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set utilizing Screech is a good option to help Golbat wallbreak, being able to 2HKO even the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier with neutral attacks. More importantly, it allows Golbat to be able to beat Sableye easily late-game. It also forces a lot of switches, making Golbat pair nicely with Spikes support. A bulky set with Substitute can be used to help ease prediction. An even more bulky EV spread can be run to check the likes of Hitmonchan more effectively, but this takes a lot away from Golbat's offensive presence. Haze can be run to prevent Pokemon from setting up on Golbat, and Thief can be used to cripple Pokemon dependent on Leftovers as their source of recovery. Curse is an option for Golbat to set up itself, but it reduces Golbat's appealing Speed that makes Golbat a popular option. Sunny Day can be used to set up sun for another Pokemon to take advantage of while also removing rain to prevent Huntail and Swift Swim Relicanth from utilizing it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mawile is immune to Golbat's STAB Sludge Bomb, resists Aerial Ace, and forces Golbat to predict with Hidden Power Ground to even hit it for chip damage. Even Choice Band Golbat will do less than 40% to Mawile with Hidden Power Ground, letting it set up for almost no cost and then Baton Pass the boosts and possibly a Substitute to one of its teammates. Sableye completely walls the Choice Band set, as Golbat cannot 2HKO it with any move, and Sableye only fears Toxic from the bulky Leftovers set. Rock-types such as Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Graveler resist both of Golbat's STAB attacks and can punish back with a super effective Rock Slide, but the latter two must watch out for a potential Giga Drain. While it can't take a Hidden Power Ground well, Plusle will always have at least one chance to KO even bulky Golbat from full health, so you need to predict well when anticipating it to come in, as it will almost always force Golbat out. Pikachu is also a potential revenge killer that forces a Speed tie with Jolly Golbat. Poison-types such as Swalot and Arbok check Golbat well, and Chimecho fares well against it unless Golbat is holding a Choice Band.</p>",

Sludge Bomb is Golbat's main STAB attack, hitting Grass-types very hard and neutral targets for good damage. Aerial Ace is the preferred STAB Flying-type attack to allow Golbat to run Hidden Power Ground. Hidden Power Ground hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Golbat usually struggles with. The last slot goes to Giga Drain, which hits Relicanth and Graveler harder than Hidden Power Ground would. Shadow Ball can be a good alternative option to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Chimecho and Haunter super effectively. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Naive nature ensures that Golbat will hit as hard and as fast as possible and will at worst Speed tie with opposing Vigoroth and Venomoth.</p> <p>Golbat is one of the best offensive switch-ins to Hitmonchan, but Rock Slide should be scouted for to ensure that Golbat is not KOed. Golbat should be kept as healthy as possible to check Fighting- and Grass-types to its maximum potential, as without Leftovers, it gets worn down quite easily. It outspeeds the majority of the tier and can be used to clean up late-game as long as all Rock- and Steel-types are properly dealt with beforehand. Golbat should avoid getting locked into moves without knowing or being able to guess most of the opponent's team, as it can become potential setup fodder for Pokemon like Pupitar, Mawile, and Plusle. Golbat has the option of running Quick Attack to beat out weakened threats, Double-Edge for an overall powerful attack, and Shadow Ball over Giga Drain to hit Psychic-types like Chimecho harder.</p> <p>Golbat appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types. Whiscash is a particularly good partner for this reason. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Tangela help eliminate Rock- and Ground-types that wall Golbat.

Sludge Bomb is Golbat's main STAB attack, hitting Grass-types very hard and neutral targets for good damage. Aerial Ace is the preferred STAB Flying-type attack to allow Golbat to run Hidden Power Ground. Hidden Power Ground hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Golbat usually struggles with. Toxic allows Golbat to put a foe on a timer, wearing down potential walls that might switch into Golbat. Whirlwind phazes the opposing Pokemon, resetting stat boosts and potentially revealing more of your opponent's team. Taunt can be used to prevent setup and other status moves, and can potentially allow Golbat to outstall certain Pokemon like Sableye by blocking its use of Recover. Giga Drain is an option to hit Relicanth, Pupitar, and Graveler harder than Hidden Power Ground would. Protect over Hidden Power Ground is an option that allows Golbat to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, which greatly increases longevity, as Hidden Power Ground isn't doing much to common Steel-types without the power of Choice Band behind it. The given EV spread maximizes HP and has enough Speed investment to make Golbat outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan, with the rest of the EVs thrown into Attack to boost Golbat's offensive potential.</p> <p>This Golbat set can be used to switch into Fighting-types more liberally, having the passive recovery of Leftovers to help it out. Golbat can also be used to deal with Grass-types, which usually rely on their STAB moves to defeat foes.

Whiscash, Hitmonchan, and Graveler are particularly good partners to perform this task. Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Dewgong, Seadra, and Mawile can cover Golbat's Ice weakness. In return, these Pokemon like the removal of Fighting-types, which Golbat does well. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Tangela help eliminate Rock- and Ground-types that wall Golbat. Diglett can remove Rock- and Steel-types, particularly Mawile, which Golbat has significant trouble playing around without good prediction.</p>"

Sludge Bomb is used to hit defensively weak Pokemon for respectable damage, scoring an OHKO on Abra and a 2HKO on Ponyta and Doduo. Hidden Power Grass is used to hit opposing Water-types like Chinchou, Wartortle, Seaking, and especially Corsola. Razor Leaf is a more niche alternative Grass-type STAB move that can be a strong option versus Calm Mind-boosted Corsola by threatening with a higher chance of a critical hit. Leech Seed can enable progress on threats that resist Gloom’s attacks like Ariados and Koffing, and it also provides safer switches for Gloom’s team. Stun Spore provides Gloom and its team speed control, which can make common threats like Ponyta, Aipom, and Beedrill much more manageable and also enable slower partners like Clamperl to outspeed and OHKO foes. Moonlight is chosen over Synthesis because it is compatible with Leech Seed. Leftovers is chosen to give Gloom additional recovery and longevity.</p> <p>This Gloom set fits best as a defensive backbone on balance teams that need support against specially offensive threats like Seaking, Flaaffy, and Corsola. Intimidate Mightyena has strong defensive synergy alongside Gloom, helping to deal with otherwise threatening physical attackers like Anorith, Aipom, and Volbeat. Mightyena can also serve to check certain special attackers that threaten Gloom such as Abra as well as other Psychic-types like Drowzee, Exeggcute, and Smoochum. Heal Bell on Mightyena is a great option that can patch up a statused Gloom. Heal Bell Flaaffy is an alternative cleric that can allow Gloom to stay in on more threats like opposing Fire Punch Flaaffy without fear of permanent burn. Gloom’s reluctance to stay in versus Quilava makes bulky Water-types such as Corsola, Seaking, and Wartortle as well as Flash Fire Ponyta strong pairings alongside Gloom. Corsola is another excellent defensive ally that fits nicely on Gloom teams, since the two cover up each other’s weaknesses with their typings. Corsola can be especially useful for helping Gloom switch out from strong Choice Band users like Aipom, Ponyta, and Doduo. Ponyta and Quilava both appreciate a strong switch-in against Water-types like Corsola and Seaking and thus pair nicely alongside Gloom. Stun Spore is an excellent way to enable slower offensive attackers like Clamperl, Cubone, and Rhyhorn. Poison-types like Koffing, Dustox, Ariados, and Beedrill can wall Gloom, especially when it's not running Leech Seed. This makes heavy hitters like Abra and Anorith great teammates to break walls that otherwise slowly deal with Gloom one-on-one. Other physical walls like Flamethrower Koffing can also be great partners to help Gloom better manage Poison-type and Bug-type threats alike. Swords Dance Tropius is another great option that can help manage Pokemon that resist Gloom's attacks, but it can expose the team with a greater Fire weakness. Specially defensive Gloom can unfortunately be exploited as setup fodder in the face of Anorith, Beedrill, and Abra. This makes priority attackers like Ponyta, Volbeat, Doduo, and Meditite great teammates that can alleviate this weakness. Gloom’s weakness to Noctowl offers another reason why certain physical attackers pair nicely with it, like Anorith and Rhyhorn.</p>"

It also threatens certain Poison-types such as Koffing, Ariados, and Beedrill. Synthesis provides Gloom with recovery to help it remain healthy while it trades blows with foes such as opposing Gloom and Koffing. The given EV spread maximizes Gloom's Special Attack while allowing it to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Elekid, while in sun. The longevity provided by Leftovers can be eschewed in favor of Lum Berry preventing a foe such as Porygon from paralyzing Gloom once.</p> <p>Gloom best fits on offense teams looking for a potent sun sweeper, being mandatory on dedicated sun teams and excellent on semi-sun teams. Gloom and other Chlorophyll sweepers such as Tropius and Exeggcute are able to weaken and remove each other's shared checks. Sun setters, such as Ponyta, can help Gloom by setting up sun and luring in Pokemon it checks such as Corsola and Clamperl. Gloom is notably very effective at removing Water-types such as Corsola, making it a natural teammate for Pokemon such as Aipom, Doduo, and Ponyta. Gloom struggles with Fire-types such as Ponyta and Quilava; while sun is active, Gloom can deal heavy damage to them with Solar Beam, but is usually OHKOed back; outside of sun, Gloom is completely helpless. Checks to them such as Flash Fire Ponyta and Chinchou make for great partners as a result. While it also hates taking Fire-type moves, Tropius can take advantage of Gloom's sun with Chlorophyll and, depending on its Attack investment, even OHKO most Fire-types with Earthquake. Offensive variants of Tropius can serve as potent checks to Gloom, outspeeding it even in sun and 2HKOing it with Hidden Power Flying or Fire, making checks to it such as Porygon good partners. Castform is a danger to most sun teams due to its good bulk and ability turning it into a Fire-type while in sun, making checks to it such as wallbreakers in Aipom and Doduo and bulky Pokemon in Noctowl and Koffing good teammates.

Gloom can almost never break Koffing on its own, so it appreciates partners that can handle Koffing, such as Seaking, Corsola, and defensive Noctowl. Fast cleaners like Abra, Quilava, and Volbeat greatly benefit from Gloom breaking holes in teams so they can more easily finish off weakened targets. Psychic-type moves from Pokemon like Abra, Drowzee, and Smoochum chew through Gloom, so Mightyena and Magnemite are helpful to mitigate these threats. Fast Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava are a threat to Gloom, and teammates like Wartortle, Castform, and Lileep manage these foes for it. Gloom struggles to prevent Beedrill from setting up freely on it, so it benefits from partnering with Quick Attack users like Ponyta, Quilava, and Doduo to prevent Beedrill from sweeping. Flaaffy threatens to 2HKO Gloom with Fire Punch, so partners that check it, such as Chinchou, Dustox, and Delcatty, are all helpful.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Parasect is NU for a good reason: its typing is awful. With two 4x weaknesses (to Fire and Flying) as well as weakness to Ice Beam, it really has a hard time coming into anything. Its really, really low Speed isn't helping either. Even in NU it is outclassed both as a Grass and a Bug Pokemon by Sunflora and Roselia for the former and Dustox for the latter. It does get some very good moves like Aromatherapy and Spore, but overall it isn't exactly worth it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Parasect could try out using Thief, but this works best if it has a physical attack or two, as otherwise, it might end up stealing a Choice Band, thus rendering itself fairly useless. Parasect has a decent amount of Defense, and thus can survive even a Choice Band Pidgeot Return without any EVs whatsoever, and max HP allows it to survive a Choice Band Double-Edge, which can take quite a few enemies by surprise, but watch out for Flying moves. Stun Spore is good for alternate status and completely screws up Pidgeot and Fearow. Aerial Ace can be used with Hidden Power Bug, but it hits so few things it's not generally worth it.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Needs a lot of HP so it can last at least one turn. A few Speed EVs can be useful, primarily for Sudowoodo. Other than that, you'll want to give it a lot in the attacking stat of choice on the attacking sets, and boost the defenses for support-oriented Parasect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ariados is immune to Spore thanks to Insomnia, and resists Hidden Power Bug and Sludge Bomb. However, it has to beware of Hidden Power Rock, as it will take a large chunk out of it. Mawile is immune to its main attack, Sludge Bomb, and resists just about anything else Parasect can throw at it, especially with that Intimidate, letting it potentially set something up with a Swords Dance or a Substitute. Glalie, although not particularly sturdy against Parasect's attacks, can scare it off with STAB Ice Beam and use that to set up Spikes. Sudowoodo shrugs off whatever Parasect might do, and attacks with STAB Rock attacks, but greatly fears special attacking sets. Murkrow and Pidgeot are also the big threats to Parasect, but have to worry about Hidden Power Rock, and even Sludge Bomb takes a hefty chunk of life. Murkrow, however, has the advantage of being immune to Spore, but Pidgeot resists Hidden Power Bug.</p>",

Only use Hidden Power Rock in NU, Hidden Power Bug is superior in UU.</p>"},
        "Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>Because people expect Spore, you might not want to use that right away. For instance, if they have Murkrow, you've just given them a free switch to come in and use Choice Banded Drill Peck on your team; the same goes for Sludge Bomb Ariados. For this reason, it's generally best to open with Swords Dance if you predict a Sleep Talker, or Hidden Power Rock if you predict one of those two. Hidden Power Rock is a good opener if you have no idea what to do, because the common switches into Parasect are weak to it. Hidden Power Ground can do something to Mawile and maybe Sudowoodo, but Sudowoodo has STAB on Rock Slide, so you can't stay in on it. Once again, only use Hidden Power Rock in NU, Hidden Power Bug and Ground are superior in UU.</p>"},
        "Special Attacker": {"description": "<p>This set's main power is that it can kill its main counters through surprise. For instance, Mawile will take quite a bit of damage from Hidden Power Fire, and Sudowoodo is 2-3HKOed by Giga Drain. If you use Hidden Power Ice, you can still hit Murkrow and Pidgeot on the switch super effective, so they'll likely think you're using Hidden Power Rock. For this reason, Growth and Sunny Day should generally be used later on in the match (and also because you need to make sure they don't have any guys that can OHKO Parasect). This is inferior to Pokemon like Vileplume in UU; the accuracy of Spore over Sleep Powder does not make up for the worse stats and ability.</p>"}

  "Venomoth": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Venomoth's Speed advantage over other common leads combined with Sleep Powder makes it easy for it to provide early-game support. After neutralizing a foe, Venomoth can easily make use of Baton Pass and Substitute to freely get a teammate into an advantageous position. Furthermore, despite Venomoth's uninspiring damage output, Baton Pass helps it keep momentum up against possible switch-ins like Metang and Sableye. Unfortunately, Venomoth is rather limited beyond these options, and its fragility makes it a poor check to Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Arbok that it'd like to switch into. Venomoth also has no means of boosting its stats apart from Silver Wind and Berries and has to use its much lower Attack stat if it wants to make use of its STAB moves. Despite these faults, Venomoth makes for a capable lead and team player on offensively inclined teams that are looking for something a little different.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Lead Support": {
          "description": "<p>Venomoth's biggest perk is that it's one of the fastest Pokemon in NU with a sleeping move, and this set aims to make the most of this fact. Venomoth works very well in the lead slot, as it outspeeds most of the other common leads, primarily Glalie and Hitmonchan, and instantly puts them out of commission with Sleep Powder. Substitute allows Venomoth to safely Baton Pass out to a teammate. Sludge Bomb or Psychic ensure Venomoth isn't set up bait. Sludge Bomb gets a great hit on Flareon, Bellossom, and Roselia, while Psychic has a bit more oomph against Arbok and Hitmonchan. Stun Spore is a decent alternative in the third moveslot that helps support the team and can deter some dangerous Pokemon like Murkrow from freely switching into Venomoth.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment is needed to Speed tie with opposing Venomoth and Golbat and securely outspeed Seadra and Glalie. Maximum HP investment allows Venomoth to more easily check the likes of Hitmonchan, and it can allow Venomoth to more easily reenter the field and attempt to land another Sleep Powder later in the match. A Petaya or Liechi Berry can be run to give Venomoth the option of Baton Passing a stat boost to a teammate. Lum Berry is another option to win the rare Venomoth duel and secure a sleep against the opponent. Thief and Toxic are good options to cripple the defensive Pokemon that would otherwise have an easy time switching into Venomoth like Sableye and Flareon.</p> <p>Diglett pairs naturally well with Venomoth, as it can trap and eliminate a few of the Pokemon that have an easy time switching into Venomoth, namely Flareon, Mawile, and Metang. Venomoth fits best on offensive teams that need the immediate momentum provided by Sleep Powder and need Glalie's Spikes prevented from being set up from turn one. Good offensive teammates that pair well with Venomoth include Murkrow, Plusle, and Raticate, as they can blow through a few of the Pokemon that are likely to switch into Venomoth and don't require setup to become offensive threats.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Venomoth's usable movepool is quite shallow, and most other offensive or supportive variants are going to be done better by Pokemon like Haunter and Chimecho. One option not mentioned so far is Screech, which when combined with Baton Pass, can be an infuriating set for your opponent to deal with, as they have to choose whether to stay in and brunt the incoming Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ground from Venomoth at -2 or allow Venomoth to scout their switch-in with Baton Pass. For other special attacking options, Giga Drain and Hidden Power Fire have some use as coverage for specific Pokemon, namely Relicanth for Giga Drain and Metang for Hidden Power Fire, but overall Venomoth is better suited to switching out of these targets to a teammate with Baton Pass.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Countering Venomoth is not difficult, as it isn't exactly Earth-shatteringly powerful, but it is tough to pin it down because of Baton Pass allowing it to keep momentum. RestTalk Dewgong and Wailord are probably the best overall switch-ins to Venomoth, as they can absorb Sleep Powder and other status from Venomoth and take a pittance from any of its moves apart from rare Screech sets, while they can easily 3HKO Venomoth with Surf and Ice Beam in return. Murkrow can switch into Sleep Powder and Psychic for free, easily outspeeds Venomoth, and OHKOes it with Drill Peck. Once Sleep Powder is out of the equation, countering Venomoth becomes an entirely easier ballgame. Chimecho and Flareon easily OHKO Venomoth with Psychic and Fire Blast. Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Relicanth have to be wary of Giga Drain but will otherwise be able to tank Venomoth's moves and OHKO it with Rock Slide. Finally, faster Pokemon such as Pidgeot, Raticate, and Haunter can easily outspeed and KO Venomoth.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Diglett is an extremely metagame-defining and unique Pokemon in NU because of its ability Arena Trap, which allows it to trap and remove many key threats in the tier, including Flareon, Pikachu, and Pupitar, as well as weakened Hitmonchan and Sableye. It also possesses a great Speed tier, making it one of the best revenge killers available, and it has good coverage and just enough offensive power to get the job done. However, Diglett has almost no defensive utility at all, making it difficult to directly switch into Pokemon it would want to trap.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Diglett could potentially run an Adamant nature to help secure KOs on bulky Pokemon like Metang, but it then fails to outspeed the multitude of Pokemon with a base 90 Speed stat. Substitute and Liechi Berry can be used to give Diglett a damage boost versus faster foes and the ability to switch moves, but this combination is sometimes unreliable factoring Spikes or prior chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Diglett is extremely weak, and even resisted attacks can KO it. Additionally, almost anything faster than Diglett can revenge kill it. The best way to deal with Diglett is to not bring too many Pokemon weak to it and have Pokemon that can set up on Choice-locked Diglett's Earthquake. Chimecho is unable to be trapped by Diglett and is able to set up on Choice-locked Diglett's Earthquake, and Sunny Day + Solar Beam users like Bellossom and Tangela can as well. Many defensive Pokemon like Sableye and Wailord can survive Diglett's relatively weak attacks and take advantage of Diglett's pathetic defenses.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Trapper": {
          "description": "<p>Arena Trap is what sets Diglett apart from the other Ground-types in the tier that are more bulky and powerful, allowing it to strategically remove many Pokemon in the tier. Diglett's only job is to trap and remove the opponent's Pokemon. Therefore, EVs are placed fully into Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature to make it as fast and powerful as possible, Speed tying with Plusle and outspeeding a crowded base 90 Speed tier with Pokemon like Pikachu, Golbat, Ponyta, Venomoth, and Vigoroth. Earthquake + Rock Slide provide EdgeQuake coverage that lets Diglett hit the Flying-types that it cannot trap with its ability. Sludge Bomb provides a way for Diglett to damage Grass-types such as Tangela and Bellossom, though both need to be significantly weakened and Sunny Day must not be in effect before Diglett attempts to trap them. Double-Edge provides good, powerful neutral coverage that can help clean up at the end of the game, provided there are no Ghost-types remaining on the opponent's side. Toxic can be used to badly poison Pokemon that Diglett cannot KO and would normally switch out to avoid Toxic from other Pokemon like Relicanth, such as Sableye and Vigoroth. Hidden Power Bug can be used over Sludge Bomb for more consistent damage to Chimecho, but it hits Grass-types for significantly less damage.</p> <p>Diglett is extraordinarily frail and is best used as a revenge killer for Pokemon like Flareon and Mawile, as well as weakened Pokemon that need to be finished off. Scouting for Baton Pass, phazing moves, and attacks that can KO Diglett is very important. Despite Mawile being something that Diglett wants to trap and remove, it can easily Baton Pass straight out of trapping if Diglett hard switches into it. Diglett also risks getting hit by an attack, and while Diglett will barely survive an uninvested Brick Break from full health, it will always be KOed by Hidden Power Steel. As a result, Diglett appreciates Baton Pass support from Pokemon such as Mawile, Plusle, and Venomoth to allow it to get in safely. Mawile in particular is useful for its ability to lure in Flareon, which Diglett can trap and remove effectively. Plusle can lure in Pupitar and weakened Roselia, so Spikes support is very useful. Diglett appreciates Spikes support from Pokemon like Roselia and Glalie, as it helps Diglett get Pokemon into range of Earthquake to be removed.</p>"

It is highly unlikely Persian is going to pull off anything game breaking against someone who knows what he's doing. The fastest Hypnosis in the game is nice to shut down at least one counter though.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Screech forces your opponent to either switch out, or stay in and eat double damage, but should only be used with Spikes. Hyper Beam can be used for some last-effort damage if Persian is going to die anyway, or to finish off something when it's not expecting Persian to do more damage. Thief is good to steal these Leftovers or Choice Band from your counter, you may want to put it on the Liechi set and use it when you're about to die. Toxic is a way of forcing permanent damage on things like Gligar and Solrock in UU, or Swampert in standard, but it doesn't help if your opponent has Aromatherapy, Rest, or Heal Bell. Thunder or Thunderbolt can be used in standard as they hurt Skarmory.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If Persian has 341 Speed (this requires 176 EVs and a Jolly nature), it is faster than all Pokemon in UU except Electrode, as well as Persian and Sneasel with more Speed EVs, so this is a good point to aim at. Then, max Persian's Attack and dump any leftover EVs into HP or a defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that resists Normal. For standard, this includes Skarmory and Forretress, who can Spike up against Persian, as well as Metagross, Rhydon and Tyranitar. Metagross can OHKO with Meteor Mash, Rhydon with Earthquake, and Tyranitar with Focus Punch, but Tyranitar can also opt to 2HKO with Rock Slide (or, if it's Choice Banded, OHKO). Hidden Power helps against Tyranitar to an extent, but Metagross isn't even 2HKOed by Choice Band Hidden Power Ground. Regirock, Scizor and Registeel can take Persian's hits as well and set-up against it. Weezing doesn't resist Normal but nonetheless takes anything that's not a Choice Band Double-Edge easily, it can Will-O-Wisp Persian and Sludge Bomb it to death. Besides all this, lots and lots of things with some kind of Defense and attacking potential can take a hit and beat Persian one-on-one. Swampert, Suicune and Milotic can beat Persian, though Choice Band STAB attacks will bite.</p> <p>In UU, Golem takes anything like a champ and cripples Persian with Earthquake. Solrock doesn't like Shadow Ball or Iron Tail much but it can help it with Reflect and start pounding on Persian with STAB Rock Slide as well. Gligar has to avoid STAB Choice Band Normal hits but takes anything else just fine. Mawile's Normal resistance combined with Intimidate makes it quite a good counter, but beware Hidden Power Fighting or Ground. The same goes to Aggron: it takes no damage from anything but these Hidden Powers.</p> <p>And in the end, Persian still cannot take a hit, so when in doubt just hit Persian with your most powerful move and it will die in two hits maximum.

      "overview": "<p>Golduck stands out in ADV UU as a fast offensive Water-type that has access to Calm Mind. Its strong STAB Hydro Pump rips through even specially bulky foes like Kangaskhan and Ampharos. Golduck is also gifted with a unique ability in Cloud Nine, making it able to put a stop to weather-based hyper offense teams. Cloud Nine disables the Speed boost from Swift Swim and Chlorophyll, allowing Golduck to revenge kill Rain Dance Omastar and Gorebyss and Sunny Day Vileplume, as well as ignoring Sunny Day Arcanine attempting to weaken Hydro Pump by setting up sun. Golduck is a more aggressive alternative to another offensive Water-type in Slowking because of its good Speed, Cloud Nine, and no Rest turns to exploit, making it a better pick on hyper offensive teams that need a backup weather answer.</p> <p>However, Golduck faces competition from the plethora of other offensive Water-types in the tier, such as Rain Dance Omastar, Swords Dance Tentacruel, Gorebyss, and Feraligatr. It lacks the defensive profile that enables Pokemon like Slowking to play the long game, which leaves it easily worn down by stray attacks and status as it tries to set up, and Golduck only makes up for it with its moderately fast base Speed stat. Additionally, Golduck's ability to revenge kill weather sweepers is replicated by Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask, which can also revenge kill other fast Pokemon like Scyther and Tentacruel.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used over Psychic to maintain a strong hit on Vileplume while having coverage for Cradily and Altaria, but Golduck would lack coverage for Tentacruel unless it uses Hidden Power Electric, which can't OHKO Omastar. Hypnosis lets Golduck shut down slower Pokemon that threaten it like Ampharos and Lanturn, giving it reliable setup turns. However, dropping any coverage Golduck has severely limits its ability to threaten its checks, and it can be risky to rely on Hypnosis's meager 60% accuracy. Lum Berry prevents Golduck from being worn down by status, letting it attack or set up against an incoming Toxic or paralysis move. Mystic Water allows Golduck to have the damage of a Modest nature on its STAB moves while maintaining the speed tie with Jolly Gligar that Timid provides. However, it's worth noting that while Golduck is not as reliant on the passive recovery of Leftovers as an offensive sweeper, any amount of passive damage, from Spikes to Toxic, permanently sticking makes Golduck much more fragile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Golduck is threatened by every common Electric-type in the tier. Ampharos has good special bulk and a Thunderbolt that can OHKO an unboosted Golduck, Lanturn has ample opportunity to gain entry with its Water resistance, and all other Electric-types, such as Electrode, Electabuzz, and Manectric, outspeed Golduck. However, Ampharos can't switch in too many times throughout a battle and has to stay out of range of a boosted Hydro Pump, while the faster Electric-types can't switch in well at all.</p> <p><strong>Cradily</strong>: Cradily is a bulky special wall that can put Golduck on a timer with Toxic, and it can also use Recover to take advantage of Hydro Pump's low PP as well as rack up Toxic damage. However, Golduck can take advantage of Cradily's general passivity to boost, and it doesn't take much damage from Cradily's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Because Golduck is reliant on its Speed to make successful sweeps, paralysis from Kangaskhan's Body Slam, Vileplume's Stun Spore, or Misdreavus's Thunder Wave stops Golduck dead in its tracks and allows more Pokemon to take advantage of its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon with phazing moves like Walrein, Altaria, and Blastoise stand in the way of Golduck's sweep with their good bulk and force it to start again from square one. However, most of these Pokemon don't like taking initial damage from Hidden Power Grass, and they can't threaten Golduck back aside from phazing it.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Golduck can find opportunities to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon such as Omastar, Gligar, or Kangaskhan after it uses Rest. The threat of Calm Mind can prevent Kangaskhan from using Rest to stall Golduck, as +1 Hydro Pump 2HKOes specially defensive variants. It can also set up by forcing out a Rock- or Ground-type such as Solrock or Gligar, on which Golduck can enter with a double switch, after they KO Golduck's teammate, or after a teammate has used Explosion. Psychic is used to hit Poison-types that resist Water like Tentacruel, Vileplume, and Qwilfish. Hidden Power Grass is used for other Water-types, notably OHKOing Omastar and 2HKOing Gorebyss, which Golduck can revenge kill by ignoring Swift Swim. While Hydro Pump is Golduck's preferred STAB option, Golduck can also feasibly run Surf over Hidden Power Grass to have guaranteed accuracy against super effective targets while also preserving Hydro Pump's minimal 8 PP.</p> <p>A Timid nature allows Golduck to, at worst, speed tie with other base 85 Speed Pokemon like Gligar, Qwilfish, and Nidoking. A Modest Golduck hits harder with its coverage, allowing for reliable 2HKOs on Vileplume and Tentacruel and a 3HKO on Lanturn without boosts while still outspeeding Omastar, Gorebyss, and Vileplume.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golduck fits well on hyper offensive teams as a Water-type setup sweeper that helps its frail teammates avoid being bowled over by weather sweepers. Golduck appreciates Spikes support from offensive spikers such as Qwilfish and Glalie, which lay as many layers of Spikes down as possible before they use Explosion to bring in an offensive teammate. Yawn Kangaskhan can create entry points for Golduck by threatening the opponent with sleep, which can force out or disable Electric-types and bulky Water-types that would give Golduck trouble when it sets up. Due to Golduck's difficult matchups against Electric-types, it appreciates Ground-types that reliably check them and keep up offensive pressure like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Sandslash; Nidoqueen and Nidoking are fast wallbreakers with great coverage, whereas Sandslash is a Swords Dance sweeper with great physical bulk. In return, Golduck can adequately handle any Water-types that give these Pokemon trouble. If Golduck ever faints before it can complete a sweep, it appreciates a cleaner that can take advantage of the damage Golduck has done and revenge kill foes, such as Scyther, Arcanine, Haunter, or a fast Electric-type like Electrode.</p>"

Light Screen is in itself a good support option, but Golduck isn't the best user of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos is one of the best counters to Golduck. In addition to packing a super effective STAB Thunderbolt, the common RestTalk Zapdos doesn't mind Hypnosis, while most defensive sets can take several hits--even the super effective Ice Beam.

STAB-boosted Cross Chop threatens common physically defensive walls such as Nosepass and Lileep while 2HKOing bulkier Pokemon that don't resist Fighting such as Cubone and Croconaw. Lileep finds itself as the physically defensive backbone on a plethora of different teams, and this allows Mankey to standout because of its adeptness at threatening it with Cross Chop. Earthquake provides Mankey with a more accurate option against Fire-types like Growlithe and Cyndaquil and Electric-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Elekid. Mankey is able to outspeed the previous two and is able to avoid being OHKOed by Elekid's Thunderbolt while at full health. Rock Slide threatens Dustox and Flying-types like Pidgeotto, Tailow, and Delibird that may try to switch in on an Earthquake. Because of the sheer amount of switches Mankey forces, Focus Punch is a viable option, allowing it to heavily damage or OHKO would be switch-ins like Bayleef. Vital Spirit provides Mankey with an opportunity to switch into Butterfree on a Sleep Powder; however, Mankey Speed ties with maximum Speed Butterfree and gets OHKOed by Psychic if it loses the tie.</p> <p>Mankey excels on balance and offense teams that need a dedicated offensive Lileep check. Normal-types such as Pidgeotto, Aipom, and offensive Castform, as well as Petaya Berry Butterfree, appreciate Mankey being able to remove Lileep for them. Special attackers such as Chinchou, Elekid, Growlithe, and Staryu can remove Koffing, which otherwise completely walls Mankey. Dustox makes a great partner, as it walls Koffing and can threaten it with Psychic. Because of its poor bulk, Mankey struggles with faster attackers such as Elekid, so Pokemon with access to Thunder Wave such as Aipom, Nosepass, and Magnemite pair well with it. Utility Aipom appreciates how much Mankey threatens Lileep, which it otherwise struggles to remove due to its lack of Choice Band. Additionally, Nosepass also makes for a great partner, as its excellent bulk makes it an excellent pivot for Mankey into faster attackers like Pidgeotto. Special walls such as Delcatty, Sunflora, and Grimer can shut down special attackers that Mankey can't outspeed such as Elekid, Staryu, and Butterfree.</p>"

STAB-boosted Reversal, when at full power, OHKOes almost every Pokemon that doesn't resist Fighting bar Bayleef. Earthquake provides Mankey with an option to hit Pokemon without relying on a weakened Reversal. It also threatens Poison-types that resist Reversal such as Grimer and Dustox while also threatening Shuppet, which is otherwise immune to Fighting. Bulk Up allows Mankey to function outside of or in conjunction with its Salac Berry as a setup sweeper. The most notable instance of this is allowing it to 2HKO Dustox with Earthquake at +2. Additionally, at +1, Mankey has a chance to OHKO Bayleef with a full-power Reversal.</p> <p>Mankey fits best on bulky offense and balance builds that require a late-game sweeper.

It relies heavily on sleep inflicting moves like Sleep Powder to come in, which is risky business. In both standard and UU, it can put a great hurting into teams, provided you know how to predict and eliminate its many counters.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Primeape can Overheat Skarmory, but its STAB Cross Chop and Focus Punch will be much more useful in other situations, and it's more of a one-time deal anyway as it sharply cuts your Special Attack. It won't even OHKO Skarmory (though Forretress and Scizor will be fried). Thunder or Thunderbolt work against Skarmory as well, and nothing else. Ice Punch, as idiotic as it seems, is good in UU because it hits Gligar and will usually 2HKO it. Thief can be used to steal Leftovers or Choice Band from something that walls you, comes handy in both standard and UU. Screech can force switches or cause massive damage from Cross Chop. With Taunt, you stop status from hitting you, but it's more likely that Primeape will be hit up straight on his weak defenses. This is why you may want to use Counter, with or without Taunt. Taunt / Counter Primeape can surprise the hell out of Gligar, Vileplume, Skarmory, Gyarados and some other things if they come into you.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For every usual non-Reversal set, minimally 300 in standard to beat Adamant Salamence and everything else with 100 base Speed and no boosting nature. In UU, 296 is a nice number as well to beat Jolly Gligar (rare, but nice anyway), but 308 is preferable for Adamant Fearow and Jolly Kangaskhan. Use 264 Speed minimally for standard Reversal sets, and make sure your HP is not divisible by four when using Substitute with it. For the rest, Primeape should stack its Attack as much as possible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>One great counter is Gligar, as it takes neutral damage or not very effective from all Primeape's attacks not named Ice Punch, and has decent Defense. Not a lot can switch in on Primeape in UU matches; utilizing two Pokemon to deal with Primeape is another method you could try. The Choice Band set will lose to a combination of Misdreavus and Muk or Vileplume. In all honesty the best way to beat Primeape is to attack it before it attacks you.</p>",

The IVs given are for Hidden Power Flying. Outside of that, there is little reason to use Hidden Power Flying, unless you really want to hurt Heracross and Breloom badly in standard. The rest of Primeape's move's uses in UU are quite easy to tell: Hidden Power Ghost is for Hypno, Grumpig and Misdreavus and Rock Slide for random Fliers.</p>"},

There will always be something that walls you, but this set requires less prediction and can really screw opponents over in late game, or if they rely on something like Toxic to stop Primeape.</p>"},

Coming from a respective 339 Attack, Primeape can be quite a monster with this set, provided there is no Sand Stream up and no Quick Attack (or a similar move) in the way.

It's unlikely that something like Quick Attack Fearow or Fake Out Kangaskhan is going to switch into that. Use Bulk Up for an easier set-up, or Focus Punch to do some good damage on something like Skarmory before it Drill Pecks you to death. Endure can be a safer route in some situations, and usually works better with Endure.</p>"}

Fast physical wallbreakers are themselves problematic to Growlithe before it has set up Agility, so Rock-types, Steel-types, and Shuppet support Growlithe by checking them.

Water-types such as Staryu and Chinchou can usually beat Growlithe one-on-one if they switch into its Fire-type attacks, so special sponges such as Castform and Dustox make great partners. Chinchou itself is a great partner, with it able to break through the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that annoy Growlithe and spread Thunder Wave to shore up Growlithe's average Speed; in return, Growlithe can break through Grass-types for it. Physical wallbreakers such as Aipom and Taillow also work well because of their ability to break through both Water-types and special walls that could overwise beat Growlithe. If a team doesn't have a Rock-type, a Steel-type, or Shuppet, such as on certain hyper offense teams, Growlithe can sometimes be used as a check to physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Aipom and Taillow, though it shouldn't be a team's sole check to them.</p>"

Calm Mind makes Abra an even stronger attacker and allows it to 2HKO even special walls like Porygon and Delcatty with Psychic after a single boost. Encore disrupts setup sweepers like Anorith and Beedrill as well as defensive threats like Wartortle and Delcatty by locking them into an unthreatening move. This offers Abra more setup opportunities and can make up for its poor defenses. Substitute pairs well with Petaya Berry to ensure it can be activated and is a safer way to boost Abra's offensive power without risking an OHKO. STAB Psychic threatens a 2HKO on many common foes such as Flaaffy and Seaking, making Abra very difficult to switch into and very powerful as a revenge attacker. Hidden Power Grass threatens mainly Corsola with the potential to OHKO it without a boost but can also serve to hit Water-types really hard and KO them with additional damage. Ice Punch threatens Tropius with 4x super effective damage and can also be an option over Hidden Power Grass to hit Mightyena and Lileep slightly harder. Petaya Berry coupled with Abra’s Special Attack allows it to swiftly clean up chipped teams, even 2HKOing special walls like Delcatty and Porygon with a +1 Psychic. Lum Berry is a great alternative to absorb and return status to preserve when Abra can be a threat without the additional power from Petaya. Lum Berry is ideal when running Encore + Calm Mind and no substitute. A Timid nature is recommended to outspeed the entirety of the tier outside of Voltorb and Elekid as well as Ponyta, which Abra Speed ties with.</p> <p>Abra fits both on offensive and defensive teams as a late-game sweeper and constant disruptor with the threat of Encore. Abra is at its strongest when it’s preserved to clean up late-game after its checks are dealt with or in a health range that allows Abra to KO them. This makes defensive pivots critical on any team with Abra to cover a number of common threats. Koffing can take on common physical attackers like Ponyta, Beedrill, Anorith and common Choice Band users like Meditite, Doduo, Seaking, and Aipom when they’re locked into a resisted move. Intimidate Mightyena and Normal-resistant Pokemon like Corsola, Rhyhorn, and Anorith can come in on Quick Attack users as well as opposing Abra and also do respectable damage to special walls that can get in Abra's way. Abra benefits greatly from a safe switch in due to its fragility, which makes strong Baton Pass users such as Ariados, Meditite, and Delcatty great pairings. Ariados can come in on Mightyena and threaten it out with a strong STAB Signal Beam while also taking on other threats with good coverage in Sludge Bomb and Psychic for Koffing and Beedrill. Abra’s extremely poor bulk makes it an easy target for priority users, notably Doduo, Ponyta, and Meditite. Specially defensive pivots are required alongside Abra to counteract opposing special walls that are not yet in range of a KO. Ariados can serve as a strong Mightyena switch-in and additionally functions as a slow pivot via Baton Pass. Delcatty can serve as a special wall and cleric support for Abra and other offensive threats on the team. Specially defensive Gloom and Noctowl can be great alternative options. Gloom can come in on many threats like Corsola and Mightyena and force progress with Stun Spore or Leech Seed. Noctowl can slowly wear down Pokemon that Abra doesn’t threaten like Mightyena or Drowzee. Abra enjoys being paired with additional sweepers that can enable its sweep. Options like Anorith can break through special walls like Noctowl, Delcatty and Porygon that can get in Abra's way. Weather sweepers like Seaking and Tropius can also open up Abra's offensive gameplan by putting opposing teams in KO range of its attacks. Choice Band wallbreakers like Ponyta and Mightyena can offer much of the same by damaging foes that tend to slow down Abra.</p>"

This combination is supplemented by useful utility in Substitute and Endure as well as decent coverage options, which help Abra avoid being easily revenge killed or walled. Unfortunately, Abra's bulk is nonexistent; even Choice Band Hitmonchan's resisted Mach Punch can KO Abra after one layer of Spikes, and almost anything naturally faster than Abra such as Raticate or Murkrow will easily OHKO it. Additionally, certain Pokemon like Chimecho, Sableye, and Kecleon will always reliably check Abra defensively, meaning it requires a fair bit of support to bypass such checks.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If coverage is wanted over the utility of Substitute, Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit Crawdaunt super effectively while letting Abra OHKO Pupitar and Whiscash without needing to use Calm Mind. Thunder Punch can also be considered to hit both Crawdaunt and Murkrow; it's also Abra's best way to damage bulky Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong. Encore lets Abra lock foes into non-attacking moves, which can give it the opportunity to set up Calm Mind; however, Abra rarely gets the chance to use it. Hidden Power Dark gives Abra a much greater matchup against Calm Mind Chimecho, although it provides overall worse coverage than Fire Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Even with Spikes support and Calm Mind, Abra struggles to break through Sableye before it uses Recover to gain back any lost HP and KOes Abra in return with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Raticate, Murkrow, and Pidgeot can't reliably switch into Abra, but they easily OHKO it. Additionally, Haunter's Explosion can bypass any Calm Mind boosts Abra accrues. Diglett in particular is problematic, since it can remove Abra if it ever enters the field by trapping it.</p> <p><strong>Chimecho</strong>: Chimecho can switch into Abra's +1 Fire Punch and boost with Calm Mind alongside it, although its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and potentially Rest can make checking Abra a bit dicier.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Kecleon, Vigoroth, and Wailord have the bulk to take at least one boosted hit from Abra and OHKO or severely dent it.</p>",

        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind makes Abra an even scarier attacker and helps it bypass Pokemon like Flareon, Metang, and Torkoal. Psychic has good neutral coverage and hits prominent Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Roselia, and Golbat hard. Fire Punch complements Psychic well by targeting foes resistant or immune to it like Metang, Mawile, and Cacturne; it's also Abra's best way to hit Chimecho and Sableye. Substitute provides Abra with insurance against revenge killers and helps activate Salac Berry. Endure is an alternative to Substitute that lets Abra get its Speed boost from its Berry when faced with a faster attacker, although it's much more prediction reliant and can lead to Abra giving up momentum. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Abra hit hard and Speed tie with Pokemon like Golbat and Pikachu. 4 HP EVs allow Abra to activate its Berry after three uses of Substitute. Salac Berry enables Abra to be even scarier late-game, giving it the jump on Pokemon like Haunter, Plusle, and Murkrow.</p> <p>Abra's main focus should be on sweeping late-game once its checks are weakened and removed, although it can make use of its solid Speed tier and great power to revenge kill early- and mid-game. By bringing Abra in against a Pokemon like Roselia that it can easily force out, you gain a free turn to boost with Calm Mind or set up Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes from Roselia, Glalie, or Cacturne benefits Abra greatly, helping it get by Pokemon like Lickitung, Torkoal, and Flareon more easily. Similarly, special wallbreakers such as Haunter, Flareon, and Wailord wear down switch-ins to Abra like Kecleon and opposing Wailord. Haunter in particular is a solid partner—especially Thief variants—because it's great at drawing in and weakening Sableye and Chimecho. Due to Abra's extremely poor bulk, it's very prone to being revenge killed by attackers like Raticate and Pidgeot; as a result, pairing it with sturdy checks such as Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Sableye is beneficial. A slow Baton Pass user like Mawile is also great, since it can make getting Abra safely onto the field much easier.</p>"

  "Machoke": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Machoke is largely, if not almost completely, outclassed by Hitmonchan in almost every role that it would aim to fill on a team. However, as the only other available Fighting-type, and because it is far more physically bulky, it does have an advantage over Hitmonchan in its ability to both switch into and threaten certain physical attackers, particularly Pupitar, Raticate, and Piloswine, and holds a niche in the tier as a Bulk Up sweeper. Machoke also has a great ability in Guts, which allows it to hit astronomically harder than Hitmonchan if you play your cards right. Ultimately though, Hitmonchan's unpredictability, splashability, great STAB options, Speed, and ability to break through certain counters that Machoke cannot means you're unlikely to see Machoke much in the tier.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Machoke is capable of running a few other sets and alternative move options, but most are done almost 100% better by Hitmonchan. Most notably, Substitute + Bulk Up and Substitute + Focus Punch sets are pretty viable, but Substitute works counter to Guts, which is one of Machoke's biggest selling points. For alternative move options, Machoke is bulky enough to make use of Counter pretty effectively, but most attacks coming its way are likely going to be special. Body Slam and Rock Tomb give Machoke a way to slow down the opposition and can make switching into it a bit harder for the opponent. Light Screen can be used pretty effectively to protect Machoke from Chimecho and Haunter switch-ins and give it the chance to take them out, but there are typically better options for doing so and Machoke still isn't really specially bulky enough to fully take advantage of it. Finally, Low Kick is another alternative STAB option, but the NU metagame is pretty light, meaning it'll likely be outdamaged by Machoke's other STAB options most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chimecho is the top counter to any Machoke set, as it can easily switch in, outspeed, and OHKO even max HP Machoke with Psychic. Haunter can also switch into most of Machoke's attacks, although it has a bigger fear of Hidden Power Ghost than Chimecho, and easily OHKO with Psychic. Sableye has to be wary of giving Machoke a Guts boost, but without one it completely walls Machoke unless Machoke gathers too many Bulk Up boosts. Defensive Tangela isn't 2HKOed by anything Machoke can throw at it except a Choice Band-boosted Focus Punch, and it can easily Leech Seed stall out Machoke. Arbok and Swalot can wall Machoke pretty effectively if it lacks Earthquake and proceed to take it out with a couple of Sludge Bombs, but they need to be careful of giving Machoke a Guts boost. Pelipper resists Machoke's Fighting STAB moves and can proceed to stall Machoke out or easily 2HKO it with Hydro Pump if using an offensive set, although it doesn't like Rock Slide. Most Bug-types, particularly Venomoth, are also good switch-ins if they avoid Rock Slide. Finally, most special attackers are generally good answers to Machoke, as its Special Defense pales in comparison to its Defense.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Bulk Up": {
          "description": "<p>After a Bulk Up, Machoke becomes incredibly hard to break physically, making it a great option to plow through the abundant Rock- and Steel-types in the tier and meaning it's tough for Flying-types to revenge kill it. Revenge is the chosen STAB move because Machoke will almost always be going second, and this set is meant to tank through the opponent's team, meaning it thrives on being hit first and dishing the damage back out. Cross Chop is still an option for an always-powerful move, though the accuracy hurts its viability a bit. Hidden Power Ghost is needed coverage for Haunter and Chimecho, though Machoke should never stay in versus Chimecho, as it's almost always OHKOed by Psychic. Earthquake is Machoke's best option to take out Swalot and Arbok as well as being Machoke's best move for Roselia and Sableye. Rock Slide helps take out the Bug- and Flying-types likely to switch into Machoke, although Revenge will normally be doing enough to the two main Flying-types, Pidgeot and Murkrow, as they're neutral to Fighting. Lastly, Encore is also a very viable option which can make setting up far easier and forces switches. Locking something like Mawile into a status move also gives Machoke the Guts boost it loves.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs let Machoke outpace minimum Speed Mawile and other base 50s. More or less Speed can be run depending on how you want to play Machoke, with 0 Speed being an option to ensure Machoke goes second against as many Pokemon as possible in order to power up Revenge. A physically or specially defensive spread can also be used by moving the Attack EVs to whichever defensive stat you want, since even with no Attack investment, at +1 and with a Guts boost Machoke is going to be hitting like a truck regardless. A specially defensive spread can help Machoke take out the likes of Dewgong and Glalie, while a physically defensive spread can allow Machoke to more easily switch into Rock-types like Pupitar.</p> <p>Focus Punch and Brick Break can be used as alternative STAB moves, but both are less useful than Revenge and Cross Chop in most cases. If using a Substitute + Bulk Up set, with Substitute used in the last slot over Rock Slide or Encore, Focus Punch becomes a far more desirable option to consider, as the additional power is incredible for breaking normally safe switch-ins like Chimecho. If using Machoke as a lure to open up a Hitmonchan sweep, Hidden Power Bug is also an option to destroy defensive Tangela, but overall Hidden Power Ghost is more important for Haunter and Chimecho.</p> <p>Special walls are needed teammates to bring when using Machoke to switch in on the inevitable opposing Chimecho and Haunter, making Kecleon, Dewgong, and Lickitung good teammates. Hitmonchan is a good teammate to consider, as most teams will be unprepared to take on two strong Fighting-types, allowing either Hitmonchan or Machoke to weaken their counters for the other to sweep.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Machoke's great coverage and high Attack stat scream for a Choice Band set, and because Machoke is significantly tankier than Hitmonchan physically, it does hold a viable niche in the tier. Cross Chop is the recommended STAB move due to its high power and relative consistency, but the accuracy can be gut-wrenching at times, making Brick Break a decent alternative. Hidden Power Ghost is needed for Haunter and Chimecho and generally pairs well with Machoke's Fighting-type STAB move. Rock Slide lets Machoke take out certain Flying- and Bug-types looking to switch into Machoke's Fighting STAB move, particularly Pelipper and Venomoth. The move in the last slot will be rarely used, but Earthquake is still needed for Swalot and Arbok, and it is Machoke's hardest hit against Sableye.</p> <p>The biggest difference when using Choice Band Machoke over Choice Band Hitmonchan is you want to try to switch Machoke into predicted status moves to activate Guts. While Hitmonchan would be utterly crippled and walled by Toxic Sableye, Machoke can actually use it to its advantage and cleanly 2HKO even 252 / 252+ Sableye with Earthquake if it's hit by Toxic. This makes Machoke theoretically a better choice to combat heavy stall teams, but in practice Machoke will still be worn down pretty quickly and is more easy to outspeed than Hitmonchan, meaning even the slower stall teams won't find it too difficult to revenge kill Machoke.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs let Machoke outpace minimum Speed Mawile and other base 50s. From there, Attack is maxed out and the remaining EVs are placed into HP to increase Machoke's bulk as much as possible. Focus Punch can be used over any of the moves on this set, and after a Guts boost it becomes the single strongest attack in the tier without any needed setup. It can be pretty tricky to use, but it has a ton of payoff if it connects over Cross Chop, notably OHKOing Huntail, 2HKOing Chimecho, and OHKOing defensive Tangela after a Guts boost. Revenge is another alternative reliable STAB option, but it doesn't garner any notable KOs over Brick Break, and Machoke typically wants to outspeed what it can with this set. Finally, Facade can be used somewhere on this set to take advantage of the status that Machoke will likely absorb for your team, and it'll hit nearly as hard as Cross Chop without the risk of missing.</p> <p>Teammates are needed to take on Chimecho and Haunter, making special walls like Kecleon and Dark-types like Murkrow good teammates. Flying- and Bug-types are pretty dangerous for this set as well, particularly bulky examples like Pelipper, making Rock- and Steel-types good teammates, particularly Mawile and Relicanth.</p>"

However, Cross Chop's low PP and subpar accuracy hinder Machamp significantly. While it is an easy switch-in to many Pokemon, Machamp is so slow that it can't really sweep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It can Encore boosting moves such as Calm Mind and Dragon Dance, which is very helpful alongside Substitute. Also of note is Light Screen, which can help Machamp gain a few Bulk Up boosts. Counter nabs a quick OHKO on Skarmory and non-Choice Band Salamence. Hidden Power Bug is handy for getting rid of Celebi on the switch, but Machamp will need a Choice Band or some other kind of Attack boost to OHKO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Machamp has no surefire counters. Your best bet is prediction, and to hit it hard before it hits you, which is doable since Machamp is rather slow and has only average defenses. Gengar can come in on any Fighting move nicely, but will be 2HKOed by Rock Slide and usually OHKOed by Hidden Power Ghost. Dusclops is sturdier, but unlike Gengar, he cannot really hit back that well. Note that both these Ghosts should not Will-O-Wisp Machamp, as this will only make it more powerful. The same goes for Weezing; it must beware of inflicting status on Machamp with Sludge Bomb or Will-O-Wisp. If Machamp packs Facade, Weezing is dead, but it can otherwise take hits well and Pain Split off damage. Celebi makes a good counter overall, as Machamp cannot 2HKO it without Hidden Power Bug or a boosted Hidden Power Ghost; Celebi can use Recover or Leech Seed to heal, or attack with STAB Psychic. Salamence and Gyarados have Intimidate to lower Machamp Attack, and resist Fighting moves as well. Rock Slide can 3HKO them even after Intimidate, though. Finally, Skarmory is generally a reliable switch-in to Machamp, but note that a Choice Band-boosted critical hit Cross Chop will OHKO both it and Salamence.</p> <p>Basically, your safest bet is switching around with common sense, and not giving Machamp too many opportunities to come in. Sand Stream ruins Machamp's durability even more.</p>",

Facade can seriously damage Weezing if you have trouble with it, while Hidden Power Ghost eliminates Gengar and Psychic-types.</p> <p>Choice Band variants can run more Speed to beat Skarmory; Machamp will need about 128 EVs.

However, Weepinbell is exceedingly frail, being 2HKOed even by neutral hits such as Mawile's Hidden Power Steel and Relicanth's Rock Slide. Weepinbell is also not particularly fast outside of sun, making it susceptible to being revenge killed.

However, such a set makes it hard for Weepinbell to distinguish itself from other special Chlorophyll sweepers such as Tangela and Bellossom. Leftovers gives Weepinbell gradual recovery, but Weepinbell is so incredibly frail that what little health it would restore pales in comparison to the extra damage output Poison Barb offers Sludge Bomb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golbat is the ultimate check to Weepinbell, as it resists all three of its attacks and KOes back with Aerial Ace. Golbat must be careful of the rare Hidden Power Rock, however. Pelipper is another great check to Weepinbell, as it can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb and fire back with Ice Beam. Tangela can also act as a stop to Weepinbell, as the Sunny Day sweeper set outspeeds Weepinbell and KOes it with Hidden Power, and the physically defensive set can stomach an unboosted Sludge Bomb and retaliate with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Any Pokemon that is faster than Weepinbell outside of sun, including Hitmonchan, Haunter, and Pidgeot, can take advantage of its frailty.

Pokemon that can beat both Golbat and Pelipper such as Sudowoodo, Pikachu, and Plusle can help Weepinbell sweep. Weepinbell should be brought in late-game, as it lacks the power to immediately break through bulky Pokemon such as Sableye without a Swords Dance boost but excels at cleaning up thanks to its high Speed in the sun and mixed capability, making it rough for offense teams to face.</p>"

Psychic weakness doesn't help either. His immunity to Toxic and resistance to Water and Ice helps a lot though, it makes him a great counter to Milotic and Suicune in standard, as well as Blastoise and Walrein in UU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physical Hidden Power (most likely Ground, but Fighting works too) is Tentacruel's only real option for attacking, aside from Sludge Bomb, to take advantage of Swords Dance.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Usually Tentacruel should have 310 Speed in UU, unless it is a more defensive set, is an important point to hit, as the only used Pokemon that will be faster than you are the occasional Jolly Fearow, and Timid Manectric / Electabuzz. Hasty is the best nature for mixed sets, as Tentacruel's massive Special Defense is one of its major selling points, but if you're not using your Attack or Special Attack at all, Timid or Jolly should be used respectively. Stack the attacking stat(s) you're using on sweeping Tentacruel, otherwise you'll want to max out HP and put some in Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Standard: Swampert is the best all-around counter for Tentacruel, as long as Tentacruel isn't packing the rare Giga Drain. It can soak up Sludge Bombs thanks to its resistance, and use its STAB Earthquake to dish out damage. Steels like Skarmory and Metagross get in the way when Tentacruel wants to sweep with Swords Dance, because Skarmory will Roar / Whirlwind away the boosts while Metagross will Earthquake. A few Surfs or Hydro Pumps should do them in though. Gengar is 4x resistant to Sludge Bomb and can Thunderbolt Tentacruel, but again, beware of Surf or Hydro Pump. Zapdos, Jolteon and Raikou may take quite some damage from a Swords Danced Sludge Bomb, but they're quite fast (Zapdos ties with Tentacruel, the other two are faster) and pack STAB Thunderbolts. Beware of Mirror Coat, however. Salamence and Gyarados can Earthquake Tentacruel and resist his Water moves, but their Intimidate won't work on Clear Body versions and Salamence has to watch out for Ice Beam.</p> <p>UU: Quagsire is an even better counter than Swampert because of Water Absorb, for the rest he works in the same way. Whiscash plays a mini-Swampert as well, but to a lesser extent. Hypno with some Defense EVs and Reflect can pose trouble, paralyzing Tentacruel with Thunder Wave or hitting hard with STAB Psychic. A Swords Danced Sludge Bomb will bang him up sooner or later though. Kangaskhan can take a beating and try for a paralysis with Body Slam or hit hard with Earthquake. Walrein can Earthquake, or Encore Substitute or Swords Dance, but again these Swords Danced Sludge Bombs hurt. For the rest, Tentacruel is pretty hard to beat in UU. Your best bet is hitting it hard when you can, preferably with Earthquake.

The main physical walls are Walrein (who cannot touch Tentacruel with the standard set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, Ice Beam), Gligar (who is OHKOed by a Water move), and Solrock (who is also OHKOed). In OU, you have stuff like Suicune with Roar, Weezing, Swampert, and the like around to ruin your fun.</p> <p>Surf has the obvious accuracy advantage over Hydro Pump (and the slightly less obvious PP advantage, but that's not that big of a deal, as the Water move's function is solely to hit a very limited number of Pokemon), but Hydro Pump's power can come in handy. With these EVs, Surf will never OHKO max HP Aggron, but Hydro Pump always will. Hydro Pump will easily OHKO Gligar, even if it has max HP, while Surf will always OHKO min HP Gligar, but bulkier versions will survive.

Tentacruel's Special Defense is pretty good, so just by maxing HP, you will survive even a max Special Attack Zapdos Thunderbolt as long as you're on full health. Giga Drain can be used to keep Quagsire and Swampert off your ass, but Toxic will stop them from stalling against you and either switch out or attack you straight up. Hydro Pump is there for some general STAB damage.</p> <p>While it looks nice on paper, it usually won't work that well. You'll find a lot of people trying to set up something like Substitute or Calm Mind from the likes of Raikou, Gengar and Alakazam on Tentacruel, which he cannot really do anything against. Sometimes they will just weaken with Tentacruel with something else, and then kill you with their Thunderbolt. Or they could repeatedly Earthquake you until it goes critical, which pierces Barrier's defense boost. Still, it can be very neat, and this set actually makes a decent Suicune counter, as even if it Calm Minds to the max, it won't OHKO with Surf and risk a Mirror Coat to the face, not to mention Toxic will keep forcing it to Rest.</p> <p>For UU, this might work against Lunatone or Manectric, but again beware of Substitute and Calm Mind.</p>"

Come in on Waters (especially Cloyster) to Rapid Spin those Spikes away or to Toxic foes. Haze helps against Suicune's Calm Mind, or when Curse Snorlax is taking a nap. Note that Haze is illegal with Rapid Spin. Surf or Hydro Pump is there to hit Gengar who may try to block Rapid Spin and Toxic, but it won't do much against Dusclops or Misdreavus. Fillers like Mirror Coat and Sludge Bomb can be put in the last slot. The main problem with this Tentacruel set is that it's weak to many common attacks, and that Blastoise fills its role pretty much better in UU.</p>"}

  "Graveler": {
    "pu": {"sets": {"Offensive": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Graveler is one of many Rock-types in the tier, but it separates itself from the pack by getting STAB on Earthquake, carrying Explosion in its back pocket, and being immediately stronger and physically bulkier than Pupitar. What's more, it has a great base 95 Attack stat which is made even better when backed by a Choice Band, and Graveler makes a good check to the multitude of Normal- and Flying-types of the tier. However, Graveler needs to be very wary of Hidden Power Grass that's often carried on sets specifically to take it, Relicanth, and Whiscash out in one move. It's also extremely slow, and despite its advantages, it faces stiff competition from Sudowoodo and Relicanth for the Rock-type team slot as they are much more flexible in their movesets, sport better defensive stats and typings that make them less susceptible to their foe's coverage moves, and provide all-around better team synergy than Graveler.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set is certainly viable, as Graveler packs the typing and bulk to check Normal-, Flying-, and Poison-types throughout a game. However, a full defensive set is almost entirely outclassed by Relicanth due to its higher bulk and slightly better typing. A SubPunch set is powerful, but less useful on Graveler than on Sudowoodo due to Graveler getting STAB on Earthquake. As for individual moves, Counter can be a nice tool to use, but most of its targets are going to be hit harder by Rock Slide or Earthquake. Finally, Rock Tomb can allow a teammate to initiate a sweep against a target like Vigoroth, but most times the higher damage output from Rock Slide is just going to be more useful, and the only major target that Graveler is going to outspeed itself after using Rock Tomb is Dewgong.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best initial check to Graveler is any Water-type with decent physical bulk; examples include Wailord, Whiscash, and Kingler. The Graveler user won't typically Explode immediately, so they will usually have a safe first switch in and can easily OHKO with any Water move. Defensive Tangela is probably the best overall counter to Graveler, and it really only fears Explosion, since it can shrug off Hidden Power Bug from full health, and if Graveler uses Hidden Power Bug that just opens up an easy switch-in opportunity for a large portion of the tier. Hitmonchan resists Rock Slide and can KO Graveler with Sky Uppercut, but it can't risk switching into Earthquake.</p> <p>Relicanth and other Rock-types can switch into Rock Slide and particularly Explosion easily enough, but they must be very wary of Earthquake. If Graveler is locked into Earthquake, then Chimecho, Haunter, Pelipper, and a whole mess of other Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate can switch in for free. Choice Band Diglett can trap and OHKO Graveler with Earthquake after a layer of Spikes but cannot switch into it at all. Finally, there are a lot of Pokemon that can easily fit Hidden Power Grass onto their moveset to eliminate Graveler specifically, such as Murkrow and Plusle, and even weak ones from the likes of Pidgeot will do a massive amount of damage to Graveler.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>This set is the best way to take advantage of Graveler's good bulk and great Attack stat. Rock Slide + Earthquake is amazing STAB coverage in the tier, and they're the main moves that are going to be used most of the time; just be wary of using Earthquake and giving the opponent a free switch to Pelipper, Chimecho, Haunter, or other Ground-immune Pokemon. Double-Edge is a great safety move that doesn't have any recoil thanks to Rock Head and should be used when you're not sure what the opponent will do and has an option for both Earthquake and Rock Slide. Explosion is a good replacement and a great tool to take out the opponent's Water-type or threatening Pokemon like Hitmonchan that Graveler tends to lure in. Hidden Power Bug removes Chimecho and Grass-types from the equation and even 2HKOes defensive Tangela after a layer of Spikes. However, Explosion is also an option here in the last slot to be used alongside Double-Edge if Hidden Power Bug isn't needed, and Explosion is a great tool to take out Tangela and other Grass-types too.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs are used to outpace minimum Speed Kecleon, with the rest pumped into HP and Attack to increase overall bulk and damage output. The Speed EVs can be easily dropped and placed into HP to max out bulk, since outpacing Kecleon isn't that important most of the time, although by doing so you will also typically outrun Sudowoodo, so it really just depends on how you feel about it. Leftovers is an option over Choice Band that increases Graveler's longevity and allows it to switch moves. This is particularly useful when Graveler is being used as the team's primary check to Flying- and Normal-types, which will be running coverage specifically for Graveler and other Rock-types.</p> <p>Toxic is an option on this set, more so with Leftovers than Choice Band, to cripple the bulky Water-types that are likely to switch into Graveler. Toxic is also a good safety move in general, as Poison-types are highly unlikely to switch into Graveler. Graveler should only be chosen over other Rock-types for a team to make use of its secondary Ground typing, which brings an Electric immunity and a powerful STAB Earthquake to the table over the likes of Relicanth and Sudowoodo. Therefore, teammates that are weak to Electric, such as Pidgeot and Huntail, are ideal and both appreciate Graveler's ability to blow through sturdy checks like Mawile and Kecleon.</p> <p>Graveler is exceptionally weak to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks, being OHKOed by most of them, so unless you can time Explosion well to eliminate these threats as they come in, good defensive teammates are needed so that Graveler can switch out safely. Specially defensive Flareon, Venomoth, and Murkrow are good teammates to switch into Grass-type attacks, while Grass-types like Roselia and Electric-types like Plusle are a good option to remove Water-type attackers. Finally, Hitmonchan can switch into Rock Slide rather easily and KO Graveler in return with Sky Uppercut, making Pokemon like Haunter, Chimecho, and Flying-types valuable teammates as well.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ponyta can use Toxic on its mixed attacker set to help against Lileep and Water-types, but this necessitates the loss of Quick Attack or its coverage move, which hinders Ponyta's offensive capabilities. Ponyta can opt to compress both its mixed attacking set and its Sunny Day set into one set; however, this requires the loss of Quick Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Ponyta can be walled by bulky Water-types like Wartortle, Corsola, and Seaking. Seaking can tank a Double-Edge into a Quick Attack with no defensive investment and remove Ponyta with Choice Band-boosted (hyphen) Return or a Water-type move on its Rain Dance set. Corsola is a common check, as Double-Edge into Hidden Power Grass from Ponyta does not KO it. However, Corsola is unable to reliably OHKO Ponyta in return with Surf and must be wary of Hidden Power Grass on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>Castform</strong>: Castform can completely shut down and threaten to 2HKO Sunny Day Ponyta with Return and its ability Forecast. Mixed attacker Ponyta doesn't fare much better, as Double-Edge 3HKOes bulky Castform, while Castform's Return always OHKOes Ponyta after Double-Edge recoil. Moreover, if Ponyta lacks a Lum Berry, it is easily crippled by Castform using Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Lileep, Tropius, and Mightyena can prove to be troublesome for Ponyta. Lileep can completely wall mixed attacker Ponyta, and Sunny Day Ponyta fails to 2HKO Lileep with Fire Blast without the weather boost. Tropius can tank a Fire Blast outside of sun and threaten Ponyta with Earthquake. Moreover, Tropius outspeeds Ponyta with Chlorophyll activated. Mightyena can prove to be a nuisance for mixed attacking Ponyta with Intimidate and its customizable bulk.</p> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Toxic users such as Quilava, Mightyena, Porygon, and Drowzee are able to heavily reduce the number of times Ponyta can use Double-Edge. Paralysis spreaders like Porygon, Drowzee, Magnemite, and Gloom can invalidate Ponyta's usefulness as a fast attacker. Porygon and physically defensive Drowzee can wall mixed attacker Ponyta and cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Due to Ponyta's poor Defense, it becomes extremely susceptible to being revenge killed by other priority users like Volbeat, Doduo, and opposing Ponyta. Choice Band Doduo can 2HKO Ponyta with Quick Attack.</p>",

        "Fast Mixed Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Ponyta cements itself as a metagame-defining threat thanks to its incredible Speed and Attack stats. As a fast mixed attacker, Ponyta can threaten a majority of the metagame. Moreover, Ponyta's ability Flash Fire grants it excellent defensive utility against other Fire-types like Quilava and Magby and lets it absorb Hidden Power Fire from sun sweepers. Double-Edge is Ponyta's strongest option due to the lack of offensive Normal-resistant Pokemon. Ponyta tends to get worn down fairly quickly while using Double-Edge; Return is a viable option over Double-Edge to prevent this. The only downside is a 15% decrease in power, making it more difficult for Ponyta to threaten foes it soft checks like Castform, Tentacool, and Chinchou. Fire Blast threatens physically bulkier foes like Tropius, Gloom, and Magnemite. Hidden Power Grass threatens Corsola with a 2HKO, preventing it from switching in safely. Hidden Power Ground can be used for a better matchup against Fire-types such as opposing Ponyta, Quilava, and Magby. Quick Attack provides Ponyta with a valuable form of speed control, allowing it to revenge kill common pinch Berry users like Abra, Quilava, and Beedrill. Choice Band can be used over Silk Scarf to guarantee the Quick Attack KO on Salac Berry Beedrill and Quilava after activating their Berry. Choice Band also allows Ponyta to OHKO Quilava and opposing Ponyta with Hidden Power Ground. Due to Double-Edge being generally riskless, using Leftovers is a viable option to help mitigate the recoil. This decrease in power means Ponyta requires chip damage on Pokemon like Aipom and Quilava before it can threaten them.</p> <p>Ponyta's excellent Speed tier, its potency as a mixed attacker, and its priority access allow it to excel in almost any team structure. Fast physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Volbeat, and Doduo appreciate Ponyta's ability to threaten physical walls such as Corsola, Koffing, and Mightyena. In return, Ponyta appreciates the added offensive pressure these attackers provide, which can help open an endgame in which Ponyta can clean. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Corsola, Tropius, Gloom, and Koffing appreciate Ponyta checking physical wallbreakers Aipom, Volbeat, and Doduo. Corsola is worth a special mention, as Ponyta can threaten Gloom for it. In return, Corsola can set up on common Ponyta checks like Porygon, Castform, Wartortle, and bulky Mightyena. In that same vein, special walls like Drowzee, Gloom, Porygon, and Delcatty appreciate how Ponyta can check Aipom, Volbeat, and Doduo. Special attackers such as Clamperl, Flaaffy, Quilava, and Abra appreciate Ponyta weakening special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, Gloom, and Delcatty. Flaaffy can check Corsola for Ponyta, allowing it the freedom to use Hidden Power Ground. In return, Ponyta checks Quilava, which OHKOes Flaaffy with Overheat.</p>"

        "Sunny Day": {
          "description": "<p>Ponyta's excellent Speed tier and strong special moves allow it to shine as the premier Sunny Day user. Besides supporting its teammates, Sunny Day allows Ponyta to weaken incoming Water-types that may attempt to check it, such as Corsola, Wartortle, and Seaking. Fire Blast, while threatening on its own, becomes incredibly hard to withstand while boosted by sun. Solar Beam allows Ponyta to threaten the previously mentioned Water-types and Rock-types. It's important to note that Ponyta has a chance to OHKO bulky Wartortle with Solar Beam if it first switches into a Fire Blast. Hidden Power Ground allows Ponyta to threaten Fire-types such as Quilava, Ponyta, and Magby. Quick Attack may also be used as a safety net against Salac Berry users. It is recommended to not run maximum Speed on Chlorophyll teammates. Toxic weakens potential switch-ins early in the game before using Sunny Day later. Lum Berry allows Ponyta to disregard status users such as Porygon, Magnemite, and Gloom, resulting in more opportunities to use Sunny Day. Charcoal increases the potency of Fire Blast, and it most notably decreases the chip damage needed to KO Gloom and Tropius with Fire Blast outside of sun. It also secures the Fire Blast 2HKO on Porygon while sun is active. Run Away is used instead of Flash Fire so that Ponyta can reliably damage Porygon if it attempts to switch in.</p> <p>Ponyta fits almost exclusively on teams that center around the usage of Sunny Day. Moreover, its viability as a Sunny Day user allows it to function on semi-sun teams as well. Chlorophyll users like Gloom, Tropius, Sunflora, and Nuzleaf all benefit from Ponyta as a Sunny Day user. These Chlorophyll users can set Sunny Day on their own as well, which prevents Ponyta from needing to come in multiple times to use it. Tropius is worth mentioning, as Ponyta can weaken or remove physical walls that may prevent Tropius from sweeping. Ponyta appreciates physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Seaking, Volbeat, and Doduo to weaken or remove special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, and Tentacool. On semi-sun teams, if Ponyta chooses to use Charcoal, then a Heal Bell user such as Flaaffy or Mightyena is beneficial. Flaaffy is worth noting, as it forms a potent special attacking core with Ponyta. Flaaffy also benefits from Sunny Day, as it can OHKO Volbeat and reliably 2HKO specially defensive Gloom with Fire Punch in sun.</p>"

Rapidash's redeeming factors are Baton Pass and Hypnosis mostly, so try to use these when using Rapidash. You really should only use Rapidash in UU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quick Attack is present just to counter Pokemon with Reversal and the like. It can use Double Kick on a physical attacking set to open up room so you don't have to use Hidden Power Fighting, and this works against Substitute Tyranitar in standard to an extent.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Rapidash needs 307 Speed minimum to be faster than Jolly Kangaskhan, and a load of other UU threats like Gligar. This requires 244 Speed EVs without a nature, and, if you're going that high, you might as well max it out to go for the tie against other Rapidash, Modest Electabuzz, and Modest Manectric. Alternately, you can use a +Speed nature and bring yourself to 310 Speed, which still beats all Kangaskhan, but also outpaces the aforementioned Modest Electabuzz / Manectric, which requires 144 EVs and a +Speed nature. Most sets will then max one of the attacking stats, and then pump the rest of the EVs into the other attacking stat if you're using a mixed Rapidash, or HP if you are not. The Baton Passer should have more HP EVs than that, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune and any other Water-type shuts it out. Dugtrio can actually survive anything Rapidash throws at it except Fire Blast, and then trap it and kill with Earthquake. Aerodactyl has the advantage of resisting Fire, is faster, and has two moves that can OHKO (Earthquake and Rock Slide). Salamence easily beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Ice, same for Dragonite. All these counters should be careful for Hypnosis, if it hits of course. In Underused matches other Fire-type Pokemon generally stop it dead, if you don't have Hidden Power Ice then Altaria counters Rapidash quite easily being resistant to Fire Blast and Solar Beam and Natural Cure takes care of Hypnosis. Walrein can stall it out with Toxic, thanks to Thick Fat, or just attack it outright with Surf, same goes for Blastoise. Quagsire beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Grass. Hypno can stall out anything but a Toxic variant. Cradily stops all but the Sunny Day set, and even that one can easily get PP stalled, because the chance to get a Critical Hit is small with only 8 Fire Blast PP, and Flamethrower won't do enough.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Hypnosis is an option on this set if your opponent doesn't have a Pokemon that Rapidash can scare off (like Skarmory), giving you a free turn to set up a Substitute / Agility. Fire Blast will keep Skarmory and Weezing from erasing your boosts, so you can Substitute as they go to, say, Blissey, and then Baton Pass that Substitute to Gengar and Focus Punch it. Obviously, this set works in UU as well.</p> <p>You may not need as many Speed EVs if you are using Agility, but it might come handy to get in that crucial Hypnosis or Hidden Power. The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice, which should generally only be used in OU, as Hidden Power Grass is more important to hit Waters like Blastoise, Walrein, and Quagsire there.</p>"},

Sunny Day as they come in, Hypnosis. If they stay in, they have to eat boosted Fire Blasts, and if they switch out, they're switching to something that isn't their main special wall, so if they try and come back in, you can just use Hypnosis again on them. Hidden Power Ice hits Salamence in OU, but the main Pokemon for which it's used in UU, is Gligar, who is OHKOed by Fire Blast, and almost always OHKOed by Flamethrower anyway, so Hypnosis is probably better. Sunny Day keeps Rapidash safe from Surf as it attacks.</p> <p>Once again, the IVs are only if you choose Hidden Power Ice.</p>"},

It is a fairly safe switch-in to Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Salamence, can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, or be a true tank with Calm Mind. However, it is inferior to standard bulky Water-types, namely Milotic, Swampert, and Suicune, for a few reasons. Unlike Swampert, it isn't immune to sandstorm and lacks a resistance to Rock; unlike Milotic, it has neither Marvel Scale nor Recover, and has to rely on Rest. Finally, Slowbro's Psychic typing renders it weak to Shadow Ball and Crunch, the former of which is on some Metagross, while the latter leaves it open to Tyranitar. All in all, while Slowbro isn't the best bulky Water-type out there, it definitely has its uses.</p>",

Psych Up is handy against opponents that boost their Speed or defenses, while Yawn forces switches effectively. Sleep Talk is an option on the Calm Mind set; it makes Slowbro an even better tank. Growl is a fun option that further boosts Slowbro's walling capabilities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Snorlax, Blissey, and Suicune are hands down the biggest threats to Slowbro. Snorlax and Blissey have large HP and Special Defense stats that let them shrug off attacks easily, while Suicune can quickly reduce the PP of Slowbro's attacking moves due to Pressure. Lanturn and Ludicolo can also tank Slowbro's Water- and Ice-type attacks easily, while Celebi resists both its STAB moves.

Using Substitute allows Magnemite to rack up more Toxic damage while also letting it go for a paralysis if using Thunder Wave. Toxic helps break through walls like Porygon and Drowzee and is Magnemite's only good option against Chinchou. Thunder Wave hinders faster foes like Aipom and Volbeat and punishes Toxic-immune Pokemon like Gloom and Dustox.

Fire-types like Ponyta can also easily blow through Magnemite, so Water-types like Wartortle and special walls like Porygon can help by safely switching in on a Fire Blast. Bulky Electric-immune or -resistant Pokemon like Chinchou, Flaaffy, and Gloom can be difficult for Magnemite to handle because they exert enough pressure to outlast Toxic or are just immune to its moves. Powerful wallbreakers like Aipom can help KO or significantly chunk these threats.

Skarmory and Forretress are Magneton's primary targets, as they are potentially OHKOed by Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire and they give Magneton a free switch in when they are setting Spikes.</p> <p>Magneton can do much more in a battle than trap Steel-types. For example, it can defensively check some threats, including Choice Band Salamence locked into Hidden Power Flying; Choice Band Metagross locked into Meteor Mash; Snorlax in sand lacking Earthquake or Fire Blast; and Choice Band Aerodactyl, Zapdos, and non-Fire Punch Gengar, albeit only once, with its many resistances. Additionally, Magneton can pressure some defensive teams with its sheer power combined with the threat of status: Thunderbolt threatens Suicune and Milotic, while Toxic forces out Blissey and Celebi, and the switch-in either takes a chunk from Thunderbolt or gets hit by a nasty status ailment.</p> <p>Magneton's overall good defensive typing often gets overshadowed by its 4x weakness to one of the most common attacks in ADV OU: Earthquake. This weakness means that it will be OHKOed by most physical attackers, including Tyranitar, Metagross, Salamence, Swampert, Snorlax, Flygon, and Claydol. The weakness is especially exploited by Arena Trap Dugtrio, which can switch into Magneton's Thunderbolt and trap Magneton; to make things worse, Dugtrio is commonly used alongside Magneton's primary trap target, Skarmory, turning the trap into a one-for-one trade at best. Furthermore, offensive Skarmory can potentially outspeed and OHKO Magneton with Hidden Power Ground, while Forretress can sometimes survive Hidden Power Fire and OHKO back with Earthquake, which makes trapping these foes more difficult. Metagross and Jirachi at full health also generally win one-on-one against Magneton, meaning Magneton can't trap them without prior chip damage. Magneton's Fire- and Fighting-type weaknesses are also very relevant drawbacks, as they turn Moltres, mixed Salamence, and mixed Tyranitar into effective revenge killers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magneton only needs Thunderbolt + Hidden Power to function, which leaves it two free slots for some interesting options; Endure allows Magneton to activate Salac Berry. After the boost, Timid Magneton can outrun the entire OU metagame barring Jolteon and Aerodactyl, and it critically becomes faster than Dugtrio, meaning it cannot be successfully trapped. Additionally, it becomes faster than offensive Starmie and can check it in a pinch, and it can be used as a surprise weapon to check Flygon and Salamence with Hidden Power Ice. Alternatively, or in conjunction with Endure, Magneton can be an effective weather clearer with Rain Dance or Sunny Day; removing sand is used to great advantage when it is partnered with sand-weak Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Celebi. Metal Sound allows Magneton to scare off special walls like Blissey and Celebi and can potentially enable it to trap specially defensive Wish Jirachi from full HP; Metal Sound can also prevent last Pokemon Snorlax from sweeping your team. Swagger is an effective alternative when paired with Thunder Wave to generate key free turns for setup sweepers, Substitute users, and stat passers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Substitute Heracross, Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, and Ninjask. Charcoal is an alternative to Magnet, as it drastically increases the chances to OHKO Forretress and opposing Magneton with Hidden Power Fire; for this reason, it is sometimes seen on Skarm-Mag builds. Magneton can run the admittedly unreliable Thunder to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory when using a set without Magnet.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio is a very effective counter to Magneton, trapping and OHKOing it. Dugtrio can also switch in on Thunderbolt and revenge kill Magneton after it has successfully trapped Skarmory. It is frequently possible to infer the presence of Magneton on a team and double switch Dugtrio in as Magneton tries to trap Skarmory; this is often a game-winning play. The only things Dugtrio has to fear from Magneton are potential Hidden Power Grass on the switch and the Endure + Salac Berry set.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Celebi</strong>: Blissey and Celebi can switch into Magneton and negate the Thunderbolt damage with their recovery moves, but they are forced out by Toxic, especially when it's paired with Protect or Substitute; for this reason, teams that rely on Blissey or Celebi to sponge Magneton are often troubled by the combination of Thunderbolt + Toxic. The occasional Metal Sound or Screech might also give Blissey and Celebi issues.</p> <p><strong>Claydol</strong>: Claydol is a decent check to Magneton because it can switch into Thunderbolt and threaten an OHKO with Earthquake, although it doesn't enjoy switching into Toxic or Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Flygon</strong>: Flygon is effective at punishing Magneton, as it can switch in on Thunderbolt or for a revenge kill after Skarmory was trapped to get a free Substitute as Magneton switches out or stays in to use Toxic; since Magneton rarely runs Hidden Power Ice, Flygon only has to fear for Toxic on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While not many Pokemon can take Magneton's powerful Thunderbolt, many are just fast enough to OHKO it before it can do anything, including Salamence, Aerodactyl, Moltres, Charizard, and Brick Break Heracross.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Magneton's offensive movepool consists mainly of Thunderbolt, which hits everything in the metagame except for Ground-types and dedicated special walls like Blissey and Celebi for solid damage. Thunderbolt can OHKO specially defensive Skarmory, 2HKO maximum HP Metagross, and 4HKO Snorlax in sand. Hidden Power Fire covers Forretress and opposing Magneton, but Hidden Power Grass is very common to cover Ground-types such as Swampert and Claydol as well as catch Dugtrio on the switch. With Hidden Power Grass, Magneton can run 31 Speed EVs, guaranteeing at least a Speed tie with Jolly offensive Skarmory.</p> <p>Magneton is often packing a status move, either Thunder Wave or Toxic; the former is very effective at crippling Jirachi as well as annoying Metagross and opposing Magneton, while the latter cripples Ground-types like Swampert, Claydol, and Flygon on the switch. Toxic also forces out Blissey and Celebi so that the incoming Pokemon has to take a powerful Thunderbolt. Since Hidden Power Grass covers Ground-types, it gets usually paired with Thunder Wave, while Hidden Power Fire is most often paired with Toxic.</p> <p>Protect is commonly paired with Toxic to increase the rate of poison damage, and it scouts foes' attacks, especially Choice Band users such as Salamence and Aerodactyl. Substitute can pair with both Toxic and Thunder Wave; the former helps in forcing out Blissey and Celebi, while the latter can generate a free turn with a timely full paralysis, allowing Magneton to safely stay behind the Substitute. Substitute also has nice synergy with Leech Seed, allowing Magneton to wall slower threats like Suicune and Snorlax as well as guaranteeing Metagross traps by weakening it into KO range.</p> <p>Magnet critically gives Magneton a much better chance to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory. The difference between OHKOing and 2HKOing Skarmory is huge, as it often translates to an extra layer of Spikes for your team to deal with but could also translate to Skarmory phazing Magneton, giving it a chance to make a comeback in later stages of the game, especially if paired with Dugtrio or a Wish user such as Blissey. Magneton can alternatively use Leftovers considering it's immune to sand, and when paired with Protect or Substitute, it can become much more annoying to deal with via repeated chip damage. Leftovers makes Magneton a lot more robust against Aerodactyl, Blissey, and Electric-types.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Magneton's offensive potential and guarantees Speed tying with opposing Magneton with the same Hidden Power type. A Modest nature maximizes the odds of OHKOing Skarmory and is sufficient for outspeeding most Metagross, but it leaves Magneton slower than or Speed tying with Adamant offensive Skarmory, which can OHKO Magneton with Hidden Power Ground. A Timid nature allows Magneton to trap Adamant Skarmory and opposing Modest Magneton but gives up the favorable roll to OHKO specially defensive Skarmory. Timid is frequently used when the team has a spinner such as Claydol and thus does not mind Skarmory sticking around for a little longer or when it is beneficial for Magneton to trap opposing Magneton, most notably with Skarmory as a partner. For the latter purpose, a good benchmark is having 32 Special Defense EVs to survive opposing Magneton's Hidden Power Fire. An alternative bulky spread is 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe with a Modest nature; this is designed to always survive Adamant Skarmory's Hidden Power Ground while retaining the Speed for standard specially defensive Skarmory. However, if Magneton seeks to survive Forretress's Earthquake, it needs to use 252 HP / 84 Def / 156 SpA / 16 Spe with a Modest nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton is a key component in physical offense teams by virtue of removing Skarmory, which is the premier physical wall in ADV OU. Physical attackers like Gyarados, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Flygon greatly benefit from the absence of Skarmory, while other threats like Metagross, Heracross, and Snorlax also appreciate the removal of Skarmory as a Spiker and phazer. On physical offense squads, Gyarados and Salamence often run a sweeper set with Dragon Dance, while Metagross can run a cleaner set with Agility, a luring set for Swampert with Hidden Power Grass, or a physically defensive set with Protect. Heracross uses Substitute + Salac Berry to sweep late-game, while Snorlax can run a lure set with Self-Destruct to get rid of a key wall or be a late-game sweeper with Curse + Rest. Physical offense tends to be weak against Gengar, so Pursuit Tyranitar, or sometimes Houndoom, is a nice fit; Pursuit support also enables Curse + Earthquake Snorlax as well as a niche Pokemon like Steelix. A bulky Water-type like Swampert or Suicune often rounds out the team by giving it a check to physical attackers.</p> <p>Magneton is also a cornerstone on defensive teams that aim to get rid of Skarmory and Forretress to contain Spikes. Since these teams are generally weak to Spikes, they always pack a spinner with Magneton to make sure the entry hazard pressure is totally negated. The most common spinners paired with Magneton are Claydol and Starmie; a less common one but still seen in OU is Donphan. A defensive Celebi with Leech Seed is a common sight on these teams, since it's a set that struggles with both Skarmory and Forretress, and Leech Seed synergizes well with Substitute Magneton. Milotic and Suicune are also very common on these teams, most often paired with Claydol to form a defensive core that is resilient to offensive pressure as well as entry hazards. A bulky Metagross with Protect can be an alternative defensive backbone for the team, especially when paired with a bulky Rapid Spin Starmie. These teams often rely on a bulky setup sweeper like Curse + Rest Snorlax or Calm Mind + Rest Suicune as the late-game sweeper; since they really hate Spikes and getting phazed by Skarmory when they go through Rest cycles, Magneton is a clear necessity on these teams. Pursuit support from Tyranitar and the rare Umbreon can facilitate the use of Rapid Spin, enable Donphan, and support CurseLax sets without Shadow Ball. A Ground-immune or Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Choice Band Salamence, Zapdos, or Moltres often rounds out the team.</p> <p>Magneton is also commonly seen paired with Skarmory, forming the popular Skarm-Mag core. Magneton not only can trap opposing Skarmory and Forretress, ensuring your Skarmory will win the Spikes war, but it can also trap opposing Magneton, saving your Skarmory from getting trapped. These teams often feature a sturdy special wall, like Blissey or Celebi, in combination with a powerful wallbreaker like Choice Band Salamence to provide offensive pressure paired with Spikes. Alternatively, a fast sweeper like Aerodactyl is used in combination with a soft Zapdos check like Venusaur or Jirachi to keep up offensive momentum. A physical wall like Swampert, Metagross, or Flygon rounds out the team, together with the ever present Tyranitar for sand support. Tyranitar can also provide Pursuit support for Flygon and Skarmory, which really hate Gengar. Additionally, Pursuit can be used to chip Forretress into Magneton's Hidden Power Fire KO range.</p> <p>Magneton is also featured on Baton Pass teams, since they are weak to being phazed by Skarmory's Whirlwind. Physical Baton Pass teams feature either Swords Dance + Baton Pass Celebi or Swords Dance + Baton Pass Ninjask, rarely both. The most common recipients of the boosts are Dragon Dance users like Salamence, Gyarados, and, less frequently, Tyranitar, as well as Agility Metagross and Substitute + Liechi Berry Aerodactyl; paired with Ninjask, slow sweepers like Marowak and Medicham are also common. Alternatively, specially based Baton Pass teams featuring Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi are sometimes seen with Magneton, as Skarmory would be able to safely switch on Celebi and phaze it, thus ruining the chain; additionally, these teams don't generally pack a spinner and therefore don't appreciate Skarmory setting multiple layers of Spikes.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Salac Berry set with Flail and either Substitute or Endure can turn Doduo into a setup sweeper, but Doduo's bad defensive profile makes it an inconsistent sweeper, and ADV ZU has a plethora of Quick Attack users between Ponyta, Quilava, and opposing Doduo. Hidden Power Fighting covers Corsola, Mightyena, and Magnemite in one slot but makes Doduo's Speed IV a point lower, causing it to lose instead of speed Speed tie against opposing Doduo, Beedrill, and Anorith.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Corsola can switch into Doduo and can heal off any damage with Recover, while Doduo needs chip damage to 2HKO Corsola with Hidden Power Ground as it switches in. Tropius and Lileep can withstand attacks other than Drill Peck and force Doduo to wear itself down with Double-Edge recoil. Mightyena's Intimidate makes Doduo easier for it and its teammates to handle. Koffing and Wartortle can withstand a Double-Edge and potentially KO Doduo once it's chipped enough.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava outspeed and easily OHKO Doduo or force it out due to its frailty. Abra OHKOes Doduo but must be wary of Quick Attack as do other weakened or frail faster attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Voltorb. Ponyta and Quilava themselves can use Quick Attack to outprioritize Doduo.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Doduo's low HP stat and recoil from Double-Edge quickly wear it down and can potentially KO it. The turn-ending effect of Doduo KOing itself can be used to deny recovery to defensive Pokemon like Corsola, Gloom, and Lileep in order to set up a teammate to finish them off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Doduo is frail and easily worn down by the recoil from Double-Edge, so it does not want to risk even switching into Toxic from passive targets like Mightyena, Porygon, and Noctowl. A burn from Koffing's Will-O-Wisp will neutralize Doduo. Paralysis from Thunder Wave from Porygon and Castform as well as Flaaffy's Static is debilitating to Doduo given its frailty and reliance on its Speed to avoid being KOed itself.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Doduo is a powerful Choice Band wallbreaker and revenge killer in ADV ZU on account of its good Speed, great Attack, and few defensive answers to Normal-types in the metagame. Many Pokemon slower than Doduo like Seaking, Clamperl, and Meditite are OHKOed by Double-Edge. Certain physical walls like Koffing and Tropius cannot reliably switch into Doduo, while Mightyena and Wartortle are worn down switching into repeated attacks. Quick Attack compensates for Doduo's good but not amazing Speed and picks off weakened offensive Pokemon like Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava, notably OHKOing Abra. Quick Attack is useful to finish off weakened Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Tropius, Gloom, Beedrill, and Ariados. Drill Peck deals over 80% damage to physically defensive Gloom, reliably 2HKOes physically defensive Tropius, and lacks the recoil damage of Double-Edge. Hidden Power Ground is Doduo's best coverage move for the few relevant physically bulky Pokemon that resist Normal in the tier, enabling it to 2HKO Corsola with some chip damage, OHKO Magnemite, and 2HKO Rhyhorn.</p> <p>Doduo is a good fit on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate both wallbreaking and revenge killing. Aipom is Doduo's most significant competition thanks to its greater bulk, Speed, and coverage, although Doduo's greater power and Quick Attack distinguish it from Aipom. Doduo threatening specially bulky Pokemon like Porygon, Noctowl, and Delcatty is appreciated by special attackers like Sunny Day Gloom, Abra, and Quilava, which return the favor to Doduo by beating physical walls like Corsola, Koffing, and Magnemite. Doduo's frailty leaves it unable to deal with Pokemon it invites in like Corsola, Mightyena, and Lileep, so it depends on defensive partners like Gloom, Corsola, and Koffing to compensate for its lacking defensive value. Doduo's frailty leaves it quickly worn down when using Double-Edge and rarely able to switch in for free, so partners using Baton Pass like Delcatty can bring Doduo in safely. Toxic users like Ponyta, Mightyena, and Porygon support Doduo by chipping down foes, wearing down Heal Bell Mightyena, and luring in Delcatty for Doduo to dispatch. Pokemon like Gloom, Koffing, and Corsola struggle against late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Abra, Ponyta, Quilava, and Sunny Day Gloom and Tropius, so Doduo's strong Quick Attack is much appreciated.</p>"

  "Dewgong": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Dewgong is a fantastic Water-type in the NU tier and a staple of heavy stall teams thanks to its great bulk, ability to hard counter Huntail, and access to Perish Song. A resistance to Water- and Ice-type attacks and lack of a 4x weakness to Grass are the main advantages Dewgong has over Whiscash and Relicanth, and Dewgong even sports a resistance to Fire as well thanks to Thick Fat. Weaknesses to Rock- and Fighting-type attacks limit Dewgong's effectiveness overall as a defensive threat, particularly physically defensively, meaning its specially defensive set is far more common. Overall, Dewgong is a great choice for defensive teams needing a solid backing.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive set is certainly doable, particularly since Dewgong's STAB moves completely crush the multitude of Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types of the tier, all of which are slower than Dewgong as well. However, Dewgong can effectively check these Pokemon using a specially defensive set, and Dewgong still takes too much damage from most Rock- and Fighting-type attacks when using a physically defensive spread.</p> <p>Blizzard is a viable alternative to Ice Beam despite the shoddy accuracy thanks to its incredible damage output when it connects. Body Slam is a decent move to use on the defensive set to spread paralysis, which can make sweeping for slow Pokemon like Octillery much easier. Finally, Safeguard is a great move to protect Dewgong and its team from Toxic and other status, and Dewgong is probably the best user of the move since it outspeeds the other defensive Pokemon of the tier. However, Encore is generally more effective in this regard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmonchan fears little from Dewgong, outspeeds it, and pulverizes it with STAB Sky Uppercut. Plusle and Haunter have a tougher time switching in, but both do a lot with Thunderbolt, and Plusle can lock Dewgong into a useless move with Encore. Defensively, Kecleon and Lickitung fear almost nothing from Dewgong apart from Toxic. However, if Dewgong is running RestTalk at most they will stall Dewgong down to a stalemate. Calm Mind Chimecho has a very easy time setting up on Dewgong lacking Perish Song.</p> <p>Rock-type attacks in general do a ton to Dewgong; however, the only Rock-type that can effectively take on Dewgong one-on-one is Relicanth thanks to its resistance to Ice Beam and neutrality to Surf. Steel-types like Mawile and Metang also resist Ice Beam and are immune to Toxic, though they need to be careful of Surf. Finally, offensive Grass-types like Bellossom and Tangela can blow through Dewgong with Sleep Powder and Solar Beam, though they do not like Ice Beam.</p>",

        "Specially Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>This set is one of the best checks to special attackers in the tier, despite its weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type attacks. With max Special Defense investment, Dewgong is only 4HKOed by Huntail's Hidden Power Electric, giving it an obvious niche in the tier as a check to offensive Water-types. Ice Beam is chosen as the main STAB move, as it prevents Grass-types from switching in easily and gives Dewgong a tool to check Sunny Day Tangela and Bellossom, and STAB Ice Beam is kind of hard to switch into in general. Surf is a good choice for the second slot as a secondary STAB move that has fantastic coverage with Ice Beam, allowing Dewgong to effectively threaten Fire- and Steel-types. Alternatively, Toxic or Perish Song can be chosen instead, the former giving Dewgong a tool to wear down Pokemon that would otherwise be able to wall it endlessly like Kecleon and Lickitung, and the latter making Dewgong one of the best checks to Calm Mind Chimecho in the tier. The last two slots are dedicated to RestTalk, which is the best method for keeping Dewgong around for the whole match and lets it absorb status like Toxic as well.</p> <p>Toxic and Protect can be run together in the last two slots over RestTalk to increase Dewgong's flexibility and allow it to scout for the opponent's movesets. However, the longevity provided by RestTalk is usually far more preferable. Encore can be used in the second moveslot to disrupt an opponent's defensive Pokemon or lock an offensive Pokemon into an ineffective move. More Speed can be run, but Dewgong is already the fastest defensive Pokemon in the tier. Generally, just dropping a couple more EVs in Speed will ensure that the offensive Pokemon using minimum Speed Dewgong as their target won't be able to outspeed it.</p> <p>Most Rock- and Ground-types can't switch into Dewgong safely, but Dewgong still needs a teammate that can switch into Rock-type attacks. Piloswine, Whiscash, and Mawile are all good options to take on the few Rock-type attacks that Dewgong can't ward off on its own. Hitmonchan is a major threat to Dewgong, especially considering it has a high base Special Defense stat, meaning Chimecho, Haunter, and Flying-types are good teammates to help combat it. Physically defensive Chimecho also has an easy enough time with most of the Rock-types that threaten Dewgong.</p> <p>Plusle and strong Grass-type attackers like Sunny Day Bellossom can still run straight through Dewgong despite its massive Special Defense, making a Pokemon like Roselia or Kecleon still a good teammate to have around, but be careful of stacking too many Pokemon on your team susceptible to Hitmonchan and other physical threats like Vigoroth. For this reason, Swalot makes a very effective physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Dewgong, as it can also take on the few special attackers that give Dewgong trouble.</p>"

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Dewgong has an advantage as a special attacker in NU in that it is both very bulky and fast enough to outrun every major defensive Pokemon without any Speed investment. Ice Beam is an incredible STAB move in the tier, blasting apart the Grass-types that would normally give Dewgong trouble and being generally super hard to switch into safely. Surf pairs exceptionally well with Ice Beam and takes out the Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types that may be able to stomach an Ice Beam. Hidden Power Electric completes the coverage against opposing Water-types, though Hidden Power Grass may be chosen for a better hit on Whiscash and Relicanth.</p> <p>The last slot on this set is almost completely filler, and it depends entirely on what you'd like Dewgong to do for the team when blasting the foe isn't the best option. Encore prevents the opponent from setting up against Dewgong and can lock a defensive Pokemon into a non-damaging move. Toxic can wear down the defensive Pokemon that can comfortably wall Dewgong's attacks, particularly Kecleon and Lickitung. Perish Song ensures that Dewgong can't get run over by a late-game sweeper like Calm Mind Chimecho, and it forces switches against other bulky setup Pokemon like Wailord.</p> <p>Dewgong naturally outpaces every other major defensive Pokemon in the tier, meaning it can devote EVs that would normally be spent on Speed to HP to increase its overall bulk. However, running Speed is still an option, and max Speed ensures that Dewgong can outspeed certain attackers, most notably Flareon, as well as unboosted Pupitar, Tangela, and Huntail. However, even with max Speed Dewgong fails to outrun its most dangerous threats, namely Hitmonchan, Plusle, and Haunter, so in the end investing in bulk will probably be the most helpful.</p> <p>Icy Wind can be used on this set pretty effectively to allow another slower teammate to come in against a switch-in to Dewgong and outspeed it. This is particularly effective for counteracting the opponent's Hitmonchan and Plusle. This set is much harder for something like Hitmonchan to switch into, and Spikes makes this set even more effective, meaning Roselia is a fantastic teammate, particularly as it can provide a secondary check to Grass- and Electric-types. An offensive Pokemon that can switch into Hitmonchan is still recommended, particularly Chimecho and Haunter, as they can keep up offensive momentum. Special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung are of particular concern when using this set, making strong physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Piloswine, and Flareon good teammates. Finally, a teammate that can switch into Plusle and Haunter is needed for this set to work effectively, making dedicated special walls like Kecleon good team choices as well.</p>"

Maximum investment into Grimer's special bulk allows it to sponge special hits as effectively as possible, complimenting Curse's Defense boost.</p> <p>Grimer best fits on teams looking for a win con that can also function as a special wall against threats such as Elekid and Cyndaquil. Grimer traditionally sees itself used on balance and bulky offense teams, though Rain offense can also make use of its high special bulk and ability to pick off weakened foes. Grimer is incapable of making any meaningful progress against Magnemite, Rhyhorn, and Aron, and thus checks to them are essential for it to function. The former can be handled by special tanks and walls, such as Chinchou or bulky variants of Castform, who have the added benefit of acting as a substitute special wall if Grimer is forced out while asleep. Rhyhorn and Aron, on the other hand, can usually be checked by Water- and Grass-types such as Staryu and Bayleef. Koffing is another notable partner, as while it and Grimer share the same typing, Koffing completely walls Rhyhorn and Aron, neutering 2 of Grimer's worst matchups, while in return, Grimer handles special attackers that give Koffing trouble. Delcatty is another partner that deserves a special mention, as it can use Wish and Heal Bell to keep Grimer healthy, but its cleric sets also struggle to touch the same Pokemon Grimer struggles with. Finally, Rock- and Steel-types such as Lileep and Magnemite make good partners due to their ability to check powerful Normal-type attackers such as Aipom and Taillow, who can usually overwhelm Grimer before it can set up.</p>"

Memento can make your opponent's Pokemon harmless, so you can set up a Belly Drummer next turn. Explosion is more recommended for suicide, though. Rest, with or without Sleep Talk, makes your Muk live longer. It's really an easy switch for counters though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Muk is hard to counter. Its first set isn't shut down by anything completely, except Misdreavus and Shedinja if you run Hidden Power Grass, or Quagsire / Whiscash if you have Hidden Power Ghost. Nidoking and Nidoqueen can take one or two Ice Punches and Earthquake Muk to death.</p>",

The following content is no longer accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the ADV OU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Muk loses to many common Pokemon in standard play. This is not because of its stats or movepool, but thanks to its weakness to the most-used physical attack in the game: Earthquake. Overall, you won't find Muk doing much except surprising opponents and of course Exploding.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can paralyze the opponent, which is always handy. Imprison is unorthodox and might work in rare circumstances, but it is recommended that you stay away from it until you've tried out more standard variants. Memento can make your opponent's Pokemon harmless and set up a sweep for a Belly Drum user; Explosion is more recommended for suicide, though. Flamethrower and Thunderbolt are alternative options to hurt Skarmory, but their more powerful variants are generally superior. Rest--with or without Sleep Talk--extends Muk's lifespan; however, it provides Muk's counters with an easy switch-in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types, particularly Jirachi, Skarmory, and Metagross, are immune to Sludge Bomb. They tend to take quite some damage from either Focus Punch or Fire Blast, but with Earthquake, or in Jirachi's case, Psychic, most of them should be able to best Muk one-on-one.</p> <p>Ground-types such as Claydol, Rhydon, Swampert, Donphan, and Golem can pick Muk off with STAB Earthquake; furthermore, they resist Sludge Bomb and pack enough Defense to shrug off most of Muk's other attacks. Focus Punch might hurt Rhydon and Golem, though, and the rarely-seen Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass can shut them down for good.</p> <p>As for Rock-types, Regirock also packs Earthquake while resisting Sludge Bomb and Explosion, and has such high Defense that it doesn't much care about Focus Punch. While Tyranitar can't take Fighting attacks, it resists Sludge Bomb and Fire moves, and often packs Earthquake.</p> <p>Suicune can take most of Muk's physical assaults, Roar away Curse boosts, Calm Mind up, then Surf Muk into oblivion. Gengar 4x resists Sludge Bomb and is immune to Explosion and any Fighting or Ground moves Muk might be packing, so unless Muk carries Hidden Power Ghost or a move such as Thunderbolt or Fire Blast, Gengar will beat it one-on-one, especially if Gengar carries Psychic. Weezing can cripple Muk with Will-O-Wisp unless it puts up a Substitute in time.</p>",

Muk needs a Special Attack stat of 182 to 2HKO Skarmory with Fire Blast or Thunder; a stat of 197 is needed if using their less powerful alternatives, Flame thrower orThunderbolt.

  "Cloyster": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Cloyster has a solid niche in ADV OU because it is a Spiker with unique traits. Being a Water-type means that it naturally matches up well against opposing Water-types by freely setting Spikes against the likes of Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic, and not being a Steel-type means that it isn't trapped by Magneton unlike Skarmory and Forretress. However, it misses out on the immunities to sand and Toxic that the Steel typing provides and the many useful resistances to common attacking types.</p> <p>Compared to the other Spikers in the tier, Cloyster is not only a better choice against Magneton but also a much more threatening attacker with its good Speed combined with the coverage of its STAB Water- and Ice-type attacks that can threaten most foes. Notably, it threatens a very common spinner in Claydol but fails to threaten another common one in Starmie. Additionally, its Explosion can be used to create a hole in the enemy team by severely damaging a wall, preventing the opponent from setting up with their sweeper, or ending the turn and giving your own sweeper a free opportunity to set up.</p> <p>Despite all this, Cloyster has many shortcomings that hold it back from seeing more usage as a Spiker in OU. First, it struggles to make progress against Rapid Spin Starmie; second, its Water / Ice typing sports many weaknesses to common attacking types such as Rock, Electric, and Grass and, paired with its low Special Defense, means it is threatened by the majority of the tier; third, it's easily worn down by residual damage because it lacks access to a recovery move and is weak to sand, Spikes, and Toxic, which is why it isn't seen much on teams that want to simply outlast the opposition.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cloyster doesn't have a lot of other options, as its movepool is limited, and its niche in the metagame is very defined. Sometimes it can run a surprising Hidden Power in the third moveslot to catch certain threats off guard; for example, Hidden Power Fire can 2HKO Forretress, Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO Swampert, and Hidden Power Electric can 2HKO Gyarados. Toxic can also replace Rapid Spin or Ice Beam to cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Jolteon; however, it does nothing against Steel-types, Gengar is immune to it, and Starmie shrugs it off with its ability Natural Cure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Cloyster's weakness to Thunderbolt combined with its awful Special Defense stat means that it is threatened by most special attackers in the tier. Zapdos and Jolteon outspeed it and threaten to OHKO it, and although Magneton can outspeed Cloyster only with a beneficial nature, it can switch in safely because it resists both Ice Beam and Explosion; however, it is worth noting that Surf can 2HKO non-bulky variants. Gengar is a very annoying offensive check because it can spinblock in addition to threatening Cloyster with its powerful special attacks. Offensive variants of Jirachi can also threaten Cloyster with Thunderbolt, Thunder, and Hidden Power Grass while resisting Ice Beam and Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Unfortunately, Cloyster is weak to every type of residual damage: sand, Spikes, and status. As Cloyster can't afford to run Rest, it can't shrug off Toxic, and, combined with Spikes and sand, this means its longevity is very poor.</p> <p><strong>Spinners</strong>: Despite Cloyster's very good matchup against Claydol, the other spinners are quite annoying to deal with. Forretress resists both Ice Beam and Explosion and is only 5HKOed by Surf, meaning it has plenty of time to use Rapid Spin but must be really careful of letting Gengar switch in for free. Starmie is the most difficult spinner for Cloyster to deal with; the defensive variants take little damage from both of Cloyster's STAB attacks and can regain health with Recover, as well as threatening a 2HKO in sand with Psychic, while the offensive variants can threaten Cloyster with a vicious Thunderbolt that can OHKO in sand. One can perform a risky pivot into an Electric-type or Gengar on a Rapid Spin; however, blowing up on Starmie with Explosion is occasionally reasonable, but keep in mind that Cloyster's teammates frequently lack the offensive prowess to punch through the opposing walls without the presence of Spikes on the field.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Spiker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Cloyster can switch safely into bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic or physical threats like Snorlax and Flygon and proceed to set up Spikes for its teammates; then, it can explode for big damage and simultaneously let a sweeper come in at full health.</p> <p>Surf allows Cloyster to 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar and dent Steel-types. Rapid Spin can be very useful in situations when a Skarmory or Forretress is trying to set Spikes alongside you, giving you the option to deny theirs and keep yours up; due to its decent Speed, Cloyster can also switch in against slow threats to sacrifice itself in order to spin away three layers of Spikes in a situation where its team really needs it. However, keep in mind that Cloyster is not the world's best spinner, as it has poor longevity and is weak to Gengar, the only spinblocker in OU. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to 2HKO Zapdos and OHKO Flygon while hitting Celebi for meaningful damage.</p> <p>Coming off a nice base 95 Attack, Explosion does a lot of damage to every threat that doesn't resist it, even with no Attack investment and a hindering nature; this means that if Cloyster blows up on a predicted switch, it can trade with all its offensive checks except Gengar and Jirachi. Additionally, blowing up on a wall like Blissey, Snorlax, Celebi, or a bulky Water-type enables a follow-up threat to come in safely and set up for a sweep.</p> <p>Cloyster's high Speed investment allows it to set Spikes against the likes of Tyranitar and Metagross and outspeed slow Water-types like Swampert, Milotic, and most Suicune;  notably, this benchmark guarantees Cloyster to outspeed all variants of Tyranitar and Swampert. 72 HP and 244 Special Defense EVs allow Cloyster to always survive Timid Starmie's Thunderbolt outside of sand; this is crucial, as Starmie is Cloyster's best check. The Special Defense investment also means that Cloyster will survive two Hydro Pumps from maximum Special Attack Suicune and Swampert, while 8 Special Attack EVs are to always 2HKO bulkless Tyranitar with Surf.</p> <p>Keep in mind that Cloyster has poor longevity because of the lack of a recovery move combined with its weak defensive typing and weakness to Spikes, sand, and status. In fact, most of the time Cloyster won't have the opportunity to set all three layers of Spikes because it is so easily threatened by a large majority of the metagame; as such, Cloyster commonly sets up one layer of Spikes and explodes immediately after. However, Cloyster can be punished if it's too eager to blow up early-game when it is facing a team with a spinner; if Cloyster has exploded too early and the spinner manages to get a Rapid Spin off, Cloyster's partners will very much struggle to sweep without the necessary chip damage provided by Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cloyster is featured on offensive teams that make use of the presence of Spikes and its fast Explosion enabling offensive setup; the games tend to be quick, as Cloyster has poor longevity and doesn't transition well in the long game.</p> <p>Since Cloyster's partners rely on Spikes chip damage to boost their offensive prowess, it is natural to team up with a spinblocker to prevent opposing spinners from ruining your day; therefore, Gengar, the only spinblocker in OU, is an excellent addition to every Cloyster team. The most common set that Gengar runs on Cloyster teams is Explosion + three attacks; this set has three coverage moves to hurt most of the metagame with Spikes up, as well as having the option to lure in and blow up a special wall like Blissey to clear the way for special sweepers like Jolteon and Starmie. Alternatively, Hypnosis or Will-O-Wisp + Taunt can force a Natural Cure Pokemon to keep switching out, taking even more Spikes damage as a result.</p> <p>Fast sweepers like Jolteon, offensive Starmie, and Aerodactyl fit well on Cloyster's Spikes teams because they can clean up late-game once their grounded checks have been weakened from Spikes; additionally, the momentum generated by Cloyster getting a quick layer and then exploding is very well exploited by Speed-boosting sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Agility Metagross, and even Agility mixed Zapdos. Jolteon, Zapdos, and Moltres can wear down opposing special walls with Roar and rack up Spikes damage on the entire enemy team; alternatively, Jolteon and Zapdos can use Baton Pass to generate momentum by letting a powerful wallbreaker like Metagross or Tyranitar get in safely, and Jolteon can also act as a pseudo special check thanks to Volt Absorb. Offensive Starmie cannot phaze or generate momentum with Baton Pass, but if the opposing special wall has been weakened or removed it is one of the most threatening sweepers in the game with Spikes up due to the combination of its flawless coverage, speed, and power.</p> <p>Aerodactyl and Dragon Dance Tyranitar are popular late-game cleaners on this archetype; they love the chip damage on Swampert and Metagross and the dissuading of easy switches that Cloyster's Spikes provide. Additionally, Explosion on the right target can give Tyranitar the crucial setup turn. Due to its amazing Speed, Aerodactyl can also act as a revenge killer and defensive insurance against opposing sweepers like Super Celebi, Super Jirachi, and offensive Starmie.</p> <p>Cloyster pairs well with mixed attackers and wallbreakers like mixed Salamence, mixed Metagross, mixed Tyranitar, and mixed Swampert; all these threats benefit greatly from Spikes making it even harder for the opponent to pivot around their coverage. Mixed Tyranitar deserves a special mention, as it is a great lead that can set sand, which is crucial to chip opposing walls like Celebi, Suicune, Milotic, Blissey, and Snorlax. Additionally, Explosion users such as Metagross, Snorlax, Gengar, Claydol, Weezing, and Regice fit nicely with Cloyster alongside a last Pokemon sweeper like Calm Mind Suicune.</p> <p>Cloyster is sometimes featured on more conventional TSS (Toxic, Sandstorm, Spikes) builds because it's a Spiker that is not trapped by Magneton; to make up for its frailty and lack of a recovery move it is often paired with a Wish user such as Blissey or Jirachi, but remember that poison still ruins it. Pursuit Tyranitar is sometimes used to trap Gengar, allowing Cloyster to be a more reliable spinner.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Psychic is Gastly's most spammable attack, notably hitting opposing Poison-types like Koffing and Gastly super effectively while providing a strong hit against Diglett. Sludge Bomb deals decent damage to mixed bulky attacker Wailmer without activating Sitrus Berry, giving it high odds of being KOed by Thunderbolt afterwards. It also OHKOes Cacnea while having decent odds to do the same to Exeggcute, and it can possibly weaken other targets with its chance to poison. Shadow Ball is an alternative, also giving Gastly high, albeit slightly worse, odds of KOing mixed bulky attacker Wailmer when used before Thunderbolt. It's also Gastly's strongest move with no drawbacks against Duskull and Abra, KOing the former after Thunderbolt or Psychic and OHKOing the latter, though Gastly still loses one-on-one to them. Thunderbolt primarily hits Flying- and Water-types, damaging the aforementioned Wailmer and OHKOing foes like Doduo and Staryu. Thief is an alternative to let Gastly steal a foe's Sitrus Berry after Gastly has used up its own, notably preventing Porygon from using Recycle to stay healthy. Explosion lets Gastly sacrifice itself to OHKO most targets, including extremely bulky ones like Wailmer and Porygon. The given EV spread alongside a Hasty nature maximizes Gastly's Speed while providing enough Attack to OHKO Porygon. 76 Special Defense EVs let Gastly never be OHKOed by mixed bulky attacker Wailmer's Surf, with this matchup also being why Hasty is chosen over Naive. Of what is left over, 36 EVs are used to augment Gastly's Special Attack as much as possible, while the remainder is put into its Defense.</p> <p>Gastly is a natural fit on teams looking for a switch-in to Choice Band Doduo's Normal-type moves and Self-Destruct and Explosion users such as Wailmer, Koffing, and opposing Gastly, on teams that prefer Gastly's explosive offensive power over Duskull's better defenses. Essentially the entire metagame appreciates this support, with teammates unable to outspeed and OHKO these foes like Wailmer and Chinchou especially appreciating Gastly as a teammate. It is recommended that Gastly not reveal itself too early but instead switch in when it's clear the mentioned examples are committing to their Normal-type move. Either way, if the foe sacrifices itself for nothing or Doduo locks itself into a move that does no damage, Gastly will almost always get a KO in those situations. Gastly is also an effective answer to Porygon, as being able to KO it with Explosion is usually an advantageous trade, though players must be wary of not being too predictable and risking the opponent switching in their own Ghost-type. Beyond switching into Self-Destruct, Gastly also reliably handles Wailmer, helping Pokemon that struggle against it like Diglett, Elekid, and Koffing. Gastly primarily struggles with foes that are faster than it, such as Staryu, making a teammate like Chinchou useful at checking it. Gastly has an abhorrent matchup against Abra, being outsped and OHKOed by its STAB Psychic, with Abra even able to switch into many of Gastly's moves. Gastly is generally best off staying in to stop Abra from setting up, and once it's KOed, it can let in a faster teammate, like Elekid or Diglett, or a priority user, like Doduo, to revenge kill Abra.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Haunter is one of the tier's most potent offensive Pokemon due to its solid coverage, great power, and nearly unrivaled Speed tier, letting it pose a threat to revenge killers like Murkrow and Pidgeot as well as walls like Sableye, Wailord, and Roselia. Additionally, Haunter is quite self-sufficient; it can utilize utility moves such as Thief and Toxic to make breaking through foes such as Chimecho and Flareon easier. Haunter can even function as a late-game sweeper, utilizing Endure and a Berry to boost its Speed or Special Attack to become an even greater threat to weakened teams. Furthermore, Haunter is one of two viable Ghost-types in the tier and possesses a great amount of defensive utility; it can spinblock against Hitmonchan, check Normal-types like Pidgeot, and switch into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Relicanth. Haunter's only real shortcoming is its pitiful bulk, although even then it can take advantage of Choice-locked foes like Hitmonchan and Raticate to switch in and set Substitute.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypnosis can give Haunter free opportunities to set Substitute, but its shaky accuracy makes it unreliable. Destiny Bond works well on Haunter due to its great Speed and is useful for removing problematic foes that its teammates can't remove themselves. If using Haunter in the lead slot, Taunt lets it disrupt other common leads like Glalie and Venomoth, preventing them from setting Spikes and Substitute. Additionally, Taunt can shut down walls like Lickitung and Roselia.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chimecho</strong>: Chimecho can take multiple Thunderbolts from Haunter and easily OHKOes with Psychic in return. Although Haunter can cripple it with moves like Thief and Toxic, Chimecho can potentially have Rest, which helps with its longevity against Haunter.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Normal-types like Kecleon and Lickitung take negligible damage from Haunter's Thunderbolt and can remove poison with Rest and Heal Bell. Vigoroth is similar but can also use Haunter as setup fodder with Bulk Up. Flareon has the bulk to take repeated attacks from Haunter too and can sustain itself with Wish. Although Sableye is pressured by Spikes, it can generally take one Thunderbolt and safely use Recover afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Cacturne</strong>: Although not too common due to the competition it faces from Roselia, Cacturne fears little from Haunter outside of Explosion or Toxic and can easily OHKO it with Hidden Power Dark.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Psychic are the strongest special attacks Haunter gets and provide it with nearly unresisted coverage, only relevantly missing out on Cacturne. Substitute prevents Haunter from being revenge killed by Pokemon bulky enough to take a hit from it such as Chimecho, Flareon, and Cacturne. Explosion is useful for removing anything in KO range, be it weakened walls like Lickitung or offensive Pokemon like Bellossom. Additionally, Haunter is the fastest Explosion user the tier has, which makes it more reliable as a way to remove faster Pokemon. Thief is helpful for crippling common Haunter switch-ins like Chimecho and Sableye by removing their Leftovers, which makes them much easier to take down with repeated Thunderbolts. Toxic is also usable to cripple similar Pokemon and has great synergy with Substitute. Will-O-Wisp is very effective for crippling Metang and still does a good job of nullifying the Leftovers recovery of Pokemon such as Chimecho, Sableye, and Lickitung. Hidden Power Grass has a narrow scope of targets, but it's very beneficial for teams weak to Pupitar and is Haunter's best move to hit Whiscash with. Finally, Perish Song is a fantastic way to put a stop to Baton Pass chains. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Haunter as strong as possible and lets it outspeed Pokemon like Murkrow and Pikachu. If running Explosion, a Naive nature is preferred to not reduce its damage. Leftovers is ideal to provide Haunter with additional longevity, although if Haunter is running Thief, it should forgo holding an item. Levitate lets Haunter switch into Pokemon such as Relicanth and Hitmonchan that are Choice locked into a Ground-type move and grants it immunity to Spikes.</p> <p>There are few things in ADV NU scarier than a Haunter behind a Substitute; its great Speed and power allow it to 2HKO much of the tier, and the safety Substitute provides it with prevents bulkier attackers from taking a hit and retaliating. Haunter's bulk is terrible, but its defensive typing and ability enable it to switch into attacks such as Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut and Choice Band Metang's Earthquake, granting it a chance to set Substitute and wreak havoc. Haunter very typically draws in Pokemon like Sableye, Chimecho, and Lickitung; Thunderbolt is its best way of dealing damage to such targets, although if you opt for Thief, removing their Leftovers on their first switch in makes them much easier to break later on. While it may be tempting to use Explosion on the latter two and against other targets like Flareon and Kecleon, it should be noted that due to Haunter's low base Attack, it requires a fair bit of chip damage to KO them with Explosion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Roselia or Glalie is crucial so Haunter can pressure switch-ins like Sableye, Flareon, and Metang more effectively, especially when running Thief. Late-game sweepers such as Bellossom, Huntail, Pupitar, and Calm Mind Chimecho appreciate Haunter's ability to weaken or remove their checks. In particular, Chimecho is helpful because it provides a sturdier Hitmonchan answer. Haunter cannot deal with Normal-type walls like Kecleon, Vigoroth, and Lickitung by itself, so physical wallbreakers like Hitmonchan, Choice Band Metang, and Choice Band Relicanth make good teammates.</p>"

        "Berry": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Psychic threatens Pokemon like Roselia, Hitmonchan, and Arbok, while Thunderbolt is Haunter's best form of damage against common switch-ins such as Chimecho, Sableye, and Flareon. Endure enables Haunter to take a hard hit and activate its Berry. Alternatively, Substitute lets Haunter more reliably activate its Berry and capitalize on forced switches. Hidden Power Fire hits Cacturne and Metang harder than any of Haunter's other moves, although because Haunter must run 30 Speed IVs to use it, it's only recommended alongside Salac Berry. Alternatively, Explosion lets Haunter remove a weakened defensive Pokemon like Lickitung, Chimecho, or Kecleon. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Haunter as strong and fast as possible. If running Explosion, a Naive nature is preferred to not reduce its damage. Salac Berry makes Haunter the fastest threat in the tier, letting it avoid Speed ties with opposing Haunter and Plusle and outspeed Raticate, and enables it to run Hidden Power Fire much more reliably, although Petaya Berry is an option to boost Haunter's already amazing damage output further. Levitate lets Haunter switch into moves like Earthquake and Hidden Power Ground from Choice Band Hitmonchan and Pidgeot.</p> <p>The key to this set is preserving Haunter for late-game; although it's still a fantastic wallbreaker, the goal should be to use Endure to enable a sweep after the opposing team has been sufficiently weakened. Furthermore, avoid revealing this set's identity; by using Hidden Power Fire, you let your opponent know they aren't at risk of Speed tying with Haunter with a base 95 Speed Pokemon of their own. If it seems unlikely that Haunter will get an opportunity to clean the opposing team, using Explosion against a Pokemon like Chimecho or Flareon may open the door for another teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although Haunter is capable of pressuring its own checks, other special wallbreakers such as Wailord and Flareon make it easier for Haunter to clean late-game. In return, Haunter can pressure bulky Water-types like opposing Wailord and Dewgong. Spikes from Pokemon like Roselia and Glalie are also useful for weakening Haunter switch-ins like Sableye, Torkoal, and Metang. Between Psychic and Thunderbolt's good damage output, Haunter is still an effective wallbreaker; as a result, other late-game sweepers like Bellossom, Huntail, and Agility Metang are solid teammates.</p>"

Dropping Substitute hurts Onix's defensive utility, going without Explosion takes away from Onix's offensive potential, and not using Protect hinders Onix's longevity and ability to scout.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: Water- and Grass-types like Seaking and Gloom have no problem OHKOing Onix with their 4x super effective STAB attacks, and Abra hardly needs any prior chip damage to OHKO Onix.

          "description": "<p>Enormous Defense and a Rock typing give Onix a helpful position in ADV ZU as a check to physical attackers like Doduo, Beedrill, Anorith, and offensive Mightyena. Onix's solid base 70 Speed makes it a uniquely fast tank compared to other Rock-types like Corsola and Rhyhorn, as it can get the jump on otherwise troublesome special attackers like Flaaffy, Seaking, and Chinchou. Substitute lets Onix use the free turns it generates against Normal-types like Aipom and Doduo to better position itself against potential switch-ins like Corsola and Rhyhorn, and revenge killers like Hidden Power Grass Ponyta, Quilava, and Abra are thwarted by Onix's Substitute. Explosion lets Onix remove or make enormous dents in troublesome walls like Gloom, Porygon, and Koffing. In addition, it lets Onix trade with major offensive threats like Clamperl and Seaking that it wouldn't otherwise OHKO. Substitute synergizes with Explosion by letting Onix scout common users of Protect, such as Castform, Noctowl, and Seaking. Onix can use Protect itself over Explosion, enabling it to scout faster Choice Band users like Aipom, Doduo, and Volbeat for their Ground- and Fighting-type coverage moves. Protect also grants Onix extra passive recovery from Leftovers, which is an asset considering it has no other recovery. 176 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature make Onix faster than Meditite, neutral-natured Seaking and Chinchou, and offensive Mightyena. Choice Band Doduo only has a 1.2% to 2HKO Onix with Hidden Power Ground after Leftovers recovery when it has 176 HP EVs. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to give a much-needed boost to Onix's power, notably pushing Explosion over OHKO thresholds against targets like Porygon, Gloom, and Cubone, and the extra power helps Onix wallbreak more effectively against foes like Noctowl and Flaaffy without opening itself up to being KOed back.</p> <p>Onix shores up both the defensive backbone and speed control of offense and bulky offense teams. Its Explosion removing or heavily damaging bulky foes can open up a variety of teammates; Ponyta, Quilava, Beedrill, and Anorith thrive as cleaners from the holes Onix can blow into cores relying on bulky Water-types like Clamperl, Seaking, and Wartortle; Abra and specially offensive Ponyta love Porygon being out of the picture and having a Rock-type like Onix to tank Quick Attack from Doduo; Meditite can finish off weakened Koffing and Tropius, and Onix can handle faster Normal-types like Aipom and Doduo for it. Special walls like Gloom, Porygon, and Noctowl make up for Onix's awful special bulk, and they form complementary defensive cores with it thanks to its ability to answer physical attackers like Anorith and Beedrill. Wish support from Delcatty and Drowzee and Leech Seed support from Gloom and Tropius can provide some additional recovery for Onix, which otherwise lacks recovery beyond Leftovers. Onix is quite passive, even against targets it hits super effectively like Corsola, so it depends on more offensive teammates to pick up its slack; Seaking and Ponyta can handle Koffing, Clamperl and Gloom pressure Corsola, and offensive Mightyena and Meditite can beat Castform and Porygon.</p>"

Fortunately, there is Onix, which can utilize its decent base 70 Speed to reliably set up Sunny Day and use Explosion to conserve precious sun turns. Onix also possesses key resistances to Flying, Fire, and Poison, which makes it a great teammate for Chlorophyll users such as Bellossom and Tangela, which are predominantly Grass-type. However, using Onix has several downsides, such as the fact that it's fairly one-dimensional. Onix's Special Defense stat is also absolutely abysmal, leaving it susceptible to common special attackers such as Huntail and Chimecho. Lastly, Onix isn't that great because it only fulfills its niche on full sun teams, an archetype that isn't necessarily viable in NU.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Sunny Day allows Onix to provide utility to its teammates by activating their Chlorophyll or boosting their Fire-type STAB attack. Explosion gains momentum for the team, allowing a Chlorophyll sweeper such as Bellossom to come in without fear of taking a hit. Block, in tandem with STAB Earthquake, gives Onix the capability of beating certain Pokemon such as Swalot one-on-one. Earthquake also prevents Onix from becoming overly passive. These last two moves are fairly situational, however, as Onix's main purpose is to set up the sun and bring in a teammate.</p> <p>Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature and a potential boost from Salac Berry improve Onix's odds of reliably setting up Sunny Day. 144 Attack EVs guarantee the KO with Explosion on Pidgeot, while the remaining 112 EVs go into HP to increase Onix's overall physical bulk so that it can switch into Pidgeot and other Flying-types repeatedly if need be. While Sturdy and Rock Head are both completely useless for Onix, Rock Head could be useful for certain Trace and Skill Swap users such as Porygon and Kecleon, which would suddenly no longer take recoil from Double-Edge. As such, Sturdy is Onix's better ability. Chlorophyll users such as Bellossom, Tangela, and Tropius make great teammates for Onix, as they greatly benefit from the offensive utility it provides. Fire-types such as Flareon can also make use of the sun Onix provides, as it gives a power boost to their STAB attacks. Spikes support from suicide lead Glalie is helpful, not necessarily for Onix but for sun hyper offense teams as a whole.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A lead set utilizing Endure over Block allows Onix to more reliably activate its Salac Berry, nearly guaranteeing that it can use Sunny Day. Be aware that Onix loses to a majority of opposing leads such as Glalie, Hitmonchan, Vigoroth, Magby, and Venomoth. Rock Slide can be used over Earthquake as Onix's attacking option, nailing Flying-types such as Murkrow and Pidgeot without having to sacrifice itself with Explosion prematurely. However, Onix has likely already set up Sunny Day by the time the aforementioned Flying-types have switched in, so it's okay if it sacrifices itself. Rock Slide is also less useful than Earthquake when up against Swalot, which can Rest off the damage more easily and KO Onix with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p>Opposing Chlorophyll users such as Tropius, Tangela, and Bellossom can all wreck Onix with Solar Beam, put it asleep with Sleep Powder, or set up Swords Dance in Tropius's case. Other Grass-types such as Roselia can also make quick work of Onix, although not quite as reliably. Water-types such as Wailord, Dewgong, Kingler, and Whiscash can douse Onix with Surf or Hydro Pump. Pelipper and Huntail are considerably dangerous, as Pelipper is immune to Earthquake and has immense physical bulk, while Huntail is slower than Onix and can set up Rain Dance after Onix uses Sunny Day to countersweep with Surf. Hitmonchan can deal massive damage with Sky Uppercut and pick off a weakened Onix with Mach Punch. However, Hitmonchan still takes a lot from Earthquake and Explosion. Electric-types such as Plusle and Pikachu carry Hidden Power Grass from time to time, nailing Whiscash, Graveler, Pupitar, and, of course, Onix. Even if they opt to run Hidden Power Ice, Onix will be severely crippled due to its pitifully low Special Defense stat.</p>"

That said, with access to Double-Edge and a Speed stat that puts it above all of the common defensive Pokemon in the tier to back up its massive Attack, Kingler is still a very dangerous Choice Band attacker and late-game sweeper to look out for. It also has a nice base 115 Defense stat, meaning it doesn't simply fall over to the few priority attacks that exist in the metagame and can pull off an effective defensive set as well. While Kingler seems scary at first glance, its shallow movepool, terrible Special Defense, middling Speed, and poor coverage all attribute to its downfall, and it is ultimately effectively walled by most of the popular walls available in the tier if played around correctly.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A straight Swords Dance sweeper is a doable take on Kingler, but the immediate power of Choice Band is typically more appealing, and the fact that Kingler isn't really going to be using much other than Double-Edge means it won't necessarily appreciate the ability to switch moves with a Swords Dance set. Apart from that, there's really not much else to do with Kingler; its movepool is so shallow that there is nothing else to mention, except that Rock Tomb and Mud Shot are \"usable\" on all the above sets but probably not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Switching into Kingler is a daunting task, but Pokemon that resist Normal are a good place to start. Sableye is probably the safest answer to all Kingler variants, as it's immune to Double-Edge and Flail and takes a pittance from Kingler's coverage moves; the only things it has to really worry about are a Swords Dance-boosted Kingler and Toxic from the defensive set. Defensive Relicanth and other Rock- and Steel-types are the next best answers to Kingler, although a multitude of the latter two need to be wary of Hidden Power Ground and Surf. Defensive Tangela is a pretty surefire check to any Kingler set; it just needs to watch out for Blizzard and the rare Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p>Kingler isn't exactly bulky, so taking it out offensively and revenge killing it is a pretty easy task if you lack a good defensive answer to it. Plusle and Haunter easily OHKO any Kingler set with Thunderbolt. Offensive Grass- and Water-types will also easily OHKO with Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Grass. The main thing to keep in mind when checking Kingler offensively is to not be baited into activating its Salac Berry and then staring down the barrel of a full-powered Flail sweep.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Kingler's Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge easily OHKOes dangerous attackers like Hitmonchan and offensive Chimecho and cleanly 2HKOes bulky walls like Kecleon, physically defensive Lickitung, physically defensive Whiscash, and Dewgong after a layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Ghost ensures that Kingler isn't completely walled by Ghost-types, particularly Haunter and Shedinja, though Hidden Power Ground can be chosen instead, as it gets the same hit on Sableye while giving Kingler a much better tool for Swalot, Mawile, and Relicanth than Kingler's other moves.</p> <p>Kingler's viable physical movepool stops there, though there are other Hidden Power types worth considering. Hidden Power Rock has pretty good coverage with Double-Edge and rips apart Dewgong, Pelipper, and Golbat. Hidden Power Bug gives Kingler a reliable hit on Tangela and is a stronger option for Bellossom and Chimecho.</p> <p>The last two slots have to go to special moves in order to fill Kingler's moveset. As it happens, Surf isn't an absolutely terrible move to get locked into. Kingler's Special Attack is just high enough to make it the better option for taking out a few Rock-types, particularly Graveler, as well as Magcargo, Lairon, Sudowoodo, and Pupitar if not running Hidden Power Ground. Blizzard is Kingler's best attack for Tangela, but it doesn't have much use outside of that. The last slot can also go to Flail, but it's probably more situational than Blizzard is considering how difficult it is to use it effectively.</p> <p>A Naughty nature is used so as to not lower the power of Surf and Blizzard while giving Kingler as much power behind its physical attacks as possible. A Naive nature can be used to outrun positive-natured base 65 Speed Pokemon, particularly maximum Speed Flareon and Adamant Hitmonchan, the latter of which would make it worth it, though maximum Speed base 65 Speed Pokemon are rare. Kingler does get access to Mud Shot and Rock Tomb as alternative physical move options, which can allow Kingler to use a different Hidden Power type like Ghost more comfortably, but they're so weak that it really isn't worth getting locked into either one of them in the long run.</p> <p>Choice Band Kingler should be used primarily as a wallbreaker for another physical attacker to sweep late-game, or as part of a physical onslaught core with the goal of overwhelming the opposing team with multiple Choice Band attackers. Kingler makes for a good fit for the latter with its access to Surf and Blizzard, which can be used to remove a wall that resists Normal, such as Graveler, which would otherwise be pesky for other typical members of the team, like Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Raticate, to break through.</p> <p>Kingler is easily revenge killed by fast special attackers like Plusle and Haunter, so packing a special wall or tank is highly recommended when using Kingler, with Flareon and Sableye among the best choices for teammates. Lickitung and Kecleon are also solid choices, with Kecleon also making for a good choice for physical onslaught teams if using a Choice Band set. Having a teammate to take on defensive Tangela and Bellossom is also recommended, as they can tank an attack or two from Kingler and OHKO it in return with their Grass-type STAB moves. Murkrow stands out as a great offensive partner to switch into them, while Flareon is a great defensive choice.</p>"

        "Flail": {
          "description": "<p>A 200-Base Power Flail coming off of Kingler's base 130 Attack stat straight-up OHKOes pretty much every offensive Pokemon in the tier, and after a Swords Dance boost, it OHKOes everything save for Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types. Here are some calculations to highlight the sheer power of Kingler's Flail against a selection of common Pokemon in the tier:</p> <ul> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Hitmonchan: 120.2 - 141.7%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Bellossom: 93.8 - 110.6%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Huntail: 91.2 - 107.5%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Pidgeot: 98.3 - 115.9%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/0 Flareon: 108.3 - 127.5%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 4/0 Vigoroth: 95.3 - 112.2%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 0/252+ Wailord: 56.5 - 66.7%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 0/252+ Wailord: 113 - 133.2%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Lickitung: 53.9 - 63.5%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Lickitung: 107.5 - 126.5%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Swalot: 48 - 56.6%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Swalot: 95.7 - 112.8%</li> <li>200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Mawile: 31.5 - 37.1%</li> <li>+2 200 Base Power Flail vs 252/252+ Mawile: 62.8 - 74%</li> </ul> <p>Hidden Power Ghost has the best two-move coverage with Flail, ensuring that Haunter and Shedinja don't just completely wall Kingler. However, Hidden Power Ground is an option, as it gives Kingler a move to 2HKO maximum Defense Mawile without a Swords Dance boost, and OHKO it with a boost. Hidden Power Ground is also Kingler's best hope against defensive Relicanth, but it still manages to 2HKO maximum Defense Relicanth at +2. If you don't think that Kingler will be able to find the time to boost with Swords Dance, Surf is a decent option in its place, as it is Kingler's best option for Graveler, Pupitar, Magcargo, and Sudowoodo, OHKOing the former three and cleanly 2HKOing 252 HP versions of the latter.</p> <p>Kingler makes for an amazing late-game sweeper with this set if you can bait something like Plusle or Haunter into attacking Kingler, use Endure as they use Thunderbolt, obtain the Salac Berry's Speed boost and a full-powered Flail, and proceed to just mangle everything left on the opponent's team. Be wary of both of these Pokemon and other similar frail attackers like them using Substitute before attacking Kingler. If you aren't confident in your baiting skills, Substitute is a much safer option to bring Kingler down to 1 HP to begin the sweep; just be sure to keep Spikes off the field so that it will work correctly.</p> <p>There really aren't any other options to consider in regards to EVs or nature; however, a positive Speed nature is worth considering in order to allow Kingler to outpace Adamant Hitmonchan before attempting to boost. Considering Hitmonchan is one of the few Pokemon with access to priority in the tier, removing it when possible is desirable when using this set. That said, without a positive Attack nature, many of the KOs and 2HKOs listed above, and many more not listed, are just missed out on.</p> <p>If using Substitute, Kingler should have 8 HP EVs to try make it easier to bring it down to low health manually; however, the prevalence of Spikes in the tier makes it incredibly hard to bring Kingler down to 1 HP correctly. Substitute does come with the benefit of blocking status and protecting Kingler from priority if done correctly, but it also requires Kingler to get in on a foe it outspeeds, which is not always possible. Both Endure and Substitute have a major risk factor attached to them, but Endure is generally the better choice for the most situations in this tier.</p> <p>This set can only 2HKO most defensive threats without a Swords Dance boost, and even many offensive Pokemon with some HP investment avoid the OHKO, increasing the importance of making this set a late-game sweeper once most Pokemon on the opposing side have been weakened, and preferably with a layer or two of Spikes set up to push a few of those aforementioned calculations into guaranteed KOs. Tangela, Rock-types, and Steel-types are particularly important to remove or weaken before bringing out Kingler and attempting a sweep. Diglett is a good Pokemon to consider to use with Kingler to remove, or at least heavily weaken, the latter two obstacles. Murkrow and Flareon are both good options to consider to take on Tangela and defensive Bellossom.</p>"

Body Slam is the main attack due to its paralysis chance, and with the given EVs, it'll almost always 2HKO 4/0 Hitmonchan and Pidgeot. Knock Off is actually surprisingly good in the NU tier due to the prevalence of Spikes, and without their Leftovers, defensive Pokemon like Lickitung and Sableye become much more exposed to various 2HKOs they otherwise just barely avoid. Toxic conflicts with Body Slam a bit, but it is a great tool when combined with Knock Off to quickly wear out the likes of Sableye and other defensive Pokemon likely to switch into Kingler, like non-RestTalk Relicanth and Tangela. The last slot is largely filler, but Surf prevents Rock-types like Graveler and Pupitar from switching freely into this set, even when Kingler's using an Adamant nature. Hidden Power Ground is a good alternative if a weak Surf is undesirable, and it is Kingler's best weapon against Mawile.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment increases Kingler's overall bulk substantially due to its low base HP stat. 72 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Modest Huntail before it sets up rain, and the remaining EVs are placed into Attack to beef up Body Slam to allow Kingler to better threaten targets like Chimecho, Kecleon, and Hitmonchan. No Defense or Special Defense EVs are needed, as the investment in HP increases Kingler's bulk enough, and further defensive investment leaves Kingler outclassed by Wailord and Whiscash.</p> <p>A main goal of this set is to spread paralysis with Body Slam and generally weaken the opponent's team to allow another teammate to come in later in the match and clean up. This means that slower, but stronger sweepers that love having the opposing team paralyzed make for the best teammates, which include special Flareon, Choice Band Piloswine, and Swords Dance Tropius.</p> <p>Plusle and Haunter easily KO this set with Thunderbolt, and Haunter is usually immune to three out of the four attacks, making special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung particularly good teammates to use with this set. Kecleon is also a good check to offensive Huntail, which can otherwise set up on Kingler and KO it quite easily, although it faces the risk of getting paralyzed by Body Slam. Most Grass-types dislike getting paralyzed or poisoned by this set, but they will OHKO Kingler quite easily, making Flareon and Murkrow good teammates to use with Kingler too. Finally, Mawile makes for a particularly good defensive partner to this set, and together with a special wall like Kecleon, it can form a solid defensive core to take on a majority of the tier quite effectively.</p>"

Magnet is another, more offensive item option that boosts Voltorb's Thunder. Again, though, Voltorb's primary purpose is setting up Rain Dance and getting off the field, and it would miss the power boost to Explosion greatly. Hidden Power Grass nails Whiscash but doesn't really hit much else. Lead Whiscash is also extremely uncommon, and even if Whiscash tries to switch into Voltorb, Voltorb can just use Explosion the following turn. Thunderbolt has a more reliable accuracy than Thunder outside of rain, but because Voltorb's primary function is to set up rain, Thunder is more often than not a better option.

However, Voltorb telegraphs strongly that the opponent is facing full rain offense, which in itself is a weakness to using Voltorb, as the element of surprise is completely lost. Ghost-types such as Haunter and Sableye can even immediately switch into Voltorb turn 2 to absorb its Explosion. Furthermore, several Pokemon can check the team archetype of full rain. Opposing Huntail may win the Speed tie and countersweep Voltorb's team, RestTalk Dewgong checks Huntail and Seaking, Bellossom can eat an Ice Beam in a pinch and countersweep with Sunny Day, and Tangela sets up on Relicanth and similarly countersweeps with Sunny Day.</p>",

Explosion allows Voltorb to conserve precious turns of rain so a Swift Swim teammate such as Huntail can attempt to sweep.</p> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Voltorb to outspeed the entire metagame, while maximum Attack EVs enable the strongest Explosion possible. Because Voltorb also has Thunder and acts as a suicide lead, running a Naive nature is more optimal than running a Jolly one. Static is fairly situational, but it is infinitely more useful than Soundproof and can potentially paralyze an opposing lead to potentially generate free turns once a Swift Swim user such as Huntail comes in. Silk Scarf increases the power of Voltorb's Explosion, severely denting opposing leads such as Glalie and Hitmonchan. Offensive Pokemon that have access to Swift Swim such as Huntail, Relicanth, and Seaking are mandatory teammates for Voltorb, as they need rain being up to function and sweep. While opposing Sunny Day users such as Bellossom and Tangela are extremely threatening for rain teams and can easily survive Voltorb's Explosion, Voltorb can use Taunt to prevent them from setting up Sunny Day and countersweeping the turn it uses Explosion.</p>"

Thief gives Voltorb another option to cripple opposing Pokemon by removing their recovery in Sitrus Berry and using it itself or denying a sweep by removing their pinch Berries. Substitute is used to punish status attempts from slower Pokemon such as Porygon and Chinchou, giving Voltorb a free turn to attack or cripple the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Hidden Power Grass OHKOes Rock / Ground types such as Larvitar and Onix and lets Voltorb fight Electric-immune Pokemon without committing to Explosion. It is also worth mentioning that Hidden Power Grass into Thunderbolt KOes mixed bulky attacker Wailmer. Finally, Explosion OHKOes most of the tier, preventing troublesome Pokemon like Abra and Bagon from snowballing out of control and allowing it to beat otherwise strong checks in Chinchou and opposing Voltorb. Caution should be taken to avoid using Explosion into a Ghost-type, however.</p> <p>Voltorb pairs well with Pokemon that have trouble with Diglett and Trapinch, such as Houndour, Abra, and Elekid. Voltorb is an appealing target for Diglett and Trapinch, allowing it to force them out early, as well as having the potential to trade with them, albeit unreliably. Elekid in particular forms a potent offensive core with Voltorb, overloading their shared checks and smothering offense with their Speed and support options, like Light Screen and Thunder Wave. Wailmer is a good teammate, as it can struggle into Doduo, Staryu, and Gastly, and is a great switch-in to the Ground-types that will inevitably trap and remove Voltorb. Voltorb has strong synergy with Cacnea, as it can use Spikes against Diglett, Cubone, Trapinch, and Chinchou lacking Ice Beam. Voltorb in turn switches into Doduo locked into Drill Peck. Lastly, (add comma) Porygon and Trapinch can reliably remove Diglett in the event that Voltorb loses the Speed tie and remain healthy enough to check Abra or Elekid later in the match.</p>"

Swords Dance makes Cubone capable of blowing through even physical walls like Koffing and Tropius, and it can use it to take advantage of opponents attempting to switch in a weakened Pokemon as a sack. Double-Edge has effectively perfect coverage with Earthquake, destroying Koffing, Noctowl, and Volbeat. Substitute protects Cubone from Koffing's Will-O-Wisp and Mightyena's Toxic, and these two Pokemon would otherwise be the only Pokemon that can switch in and take a hit after Cubone has used Swords Dance. Similar to Swords Dance, Substitute also capitalizes on the switches Cubone often forces as a wallbreaker. Additionally, Substitute gives Cubone a cushion against revenge killers given its lackluster Speed. Rock Head lets Cubone use Double-Edge without fear of recoil damage. Thick Club is required to power up Cubone's underwhelming Attack stat, and the flexibility to switch moves that it provides differentiates Cubone from Choice Band wallbreakers like Anorith, Volbeat, and Doduo.</p> <p>Cubone fits best on balance and offense teams looking for an especially powerful wallbreaker. Balance teams can compensate for Cubone's defensive shortcomings with bulky partners like Koffing, Tropius, Delcatty, and Noctowl.

Fast offensive Pokemon, including Ponyta, Abra, and Aipom, can more easily clean up teams that Cubone weakens, and they compensate for its underwhelming Speed. Paralysis support from Gloom, Flaaffy, Porygon, and Castform enables Cubone to outspeed and run over paralyzed foes. Baton Pass users like Aipom, Ariados, and Delcatty offer Cubone much safer positioning, and they tend to lure in physical walls and Rock-types for it to threaten.

Ludicolo can come in more effectively because of its dual typing, but it is still susceptible to Marowak's strong hits.

It can easily utilize both physically and specially defensive sets, depending on your team's needs, although it has a tougher time going mixed, as its bulk is just not quite there to allow for it. Unfortunately for Lickitung, it is yet another defensive Pokemon in NU that's weak to Hitmonchan, decreasing its effectiveness slightly as a physically defensive Pokemon. Despite that, Lickitung is a Pokemon to strongly consider on defensive teams looking for role compression.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lickitung's movepool is huge; it just lacks the stats to really make use of most moves. Lickitung is one of the few Pokemon with access to Swords Dance in the tier, and it can use its bulk to find the time to gather boosts. Curse just usually proves itself more effective due to Lickitung's already low Speed, and the Defense boosts it gives let Lickitung out-tank much of the tier. However, Curse is illegal with Wish. Belly Drum is another way to take Lickitung on the offensive, and thanks to its good bulk, it has a chance to boost on a weak attacker without the need of setting up a Substitute for protection, but again, its low Speed and lack of priority can make it hard to use effectively. Substitute + Focus Punch can be used as an effective stallbreaker and lure against the Pokemon that will usually switch into Lickitung, such as Mawile.</p> <p>Lickitung is probably one of the best users of Counter in the tier, as it isn't OHKOed by almost anything in the tier, letting it take out select threats for your team in a similar way to Explosion lures like Sudowoodo. Psych Up is an option to copy the boosts of dangerous setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sableye and outstall them. A specially offensive set can be super tricky for your opponent to play around, as Lickitung's special movepool features very dangerous options across the board, including Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, and Surf. The only major thing holding this kind of set back is Lickitung's pitifully low Special Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmonchan is the best all-around answer to Lickitung, as it can OHKO even fully physically defensive sets with its Choice Band-boosted Sky Uppercut. Haunter is typically immune to everything that Lickitung can throw at it and will eventually run Lickitung out of Wish PP. Steel-types, such as Mawile, Lairon, and Metang, are the next most reliable answers to Lickitung, as they are immune to Toxic and take little damage from Lickitung's STAB attacks and typical coverage options. However, most are not strong enough to threaten Lickitung with a 2HKO, allowing it to heal up with Wish and safely switch to a teammate. Strong Choice Band users like Piloswine and Pidgeot will be able to 2HKO even fully physically defensive Lickitung, although Lickitung has a chance to Wish stall Pidgeot out of health if it uses Double-Edge. Finally, RestTalk users with Toxic like Relicanth can outstall Lickitung in the long run if played right.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>The most important thing to note about this set is that the playstyle and set remain the same whether you choose to go physically or specially defensive; Lickitung just ends up walling different Pokemon depending on whichever you choose. Specially defensive is the most common choice and arguably a better way to use Lickitung due to the fact that it has no special weaknesses, and physical walls are far easier to come by in the tier. With a specially defensive spread, Lickitung is one of the few Pokemon that can avoid a 2HKO from Huntail's Surf in the rain, allowing it to stall out rain turns and paralyze or poison Huntail in return. Wish and Protect provide Lickitung with reliable recovery, and it is one of the few Pokemon in the tier with access to Wish, giving it a major leg-up on its main competition in Kecleon.</p> <p>Lickitung's main niche in the tier is that it is able to run both Wish and Heal Bell on one set, allowing it to function as a kind of one-stop-shop for stall teams looking to compress roles in one team slot. Heal Bell is pretty invaluable for stall teams in NU, as a lot of stallbreakers rely on Toxic to break through some of the main defensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably Sableye and Flareon, but also other defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and Tropius. Alternatively, and also somewhat ironically, Toxic is probably the best way Lickitung is going to spread damage on the opponent's team and allows it to outstall Pokemon like Flareon with the combination of Wish and Protect. So, if you have Heal Bell covered elsewhere on your team, likely by Chimecho, Toxic is typically going to be the best choice for the third slot. Seismic Toss is the main option in the last slot to spread consistent damage on the opponent's team due to Lickitung's abysmal attacking stats and allow it to prevent Pokemon from using it as complete setup bait, particularly Substitute users. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used, since it still does a decent amount of damage to frailer special attackers like Plusle and can paralyze foes if that's desired for your team.</p> <p>If you already have a special wall on your team, Lickitung can play around with its defensive EVs to better suit your team's needs. A fully physically defensive spread can be used by moving the Special Defense EVs to Defense and changing the nature to Impish. With a physically defensive spread, Lickitung can actually outstall a lot of the physical attackers in the tier not named Hitmonchan, notably Choice Band Sudowoodo (avoiding Focus Punch and Explosion), Kingler, Flareon, and Murkrow. Lickitung can also run a more balanced EV spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with a Careful nature, which can allow it to take on a broad range of unboosted threats in the tier. With that spread, Lickitung has just enough physical bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and enough Special Defense to avoid the 2HKO from Bellossom's Solar Beam.</p> <p>Lickitung's movepool is absolutely gigantic, so there's lots of room to play around with its last two slots; feel free to fill them in with whatever best suits your team. One thing to note is that Lickitung's Special Attack is actually higher than its Attack, so its special movepool options aren't out of the question. The most prominent alternative is Shadow Ball, which allows Lickitung to actually touch Haunter, something it can't do with the given set. Knock Off can be used somewhere on the set to help its team win stall wars, as Pokemon like Sableye become significantly easier to 2HKO without their Leftovers recovery, and Choice Band threats like Hitmonchan are significantly easier to wall without their item. As for special attacking options, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Grass all have their uses and allow Lickitung to better combat certain threats like Tangela, Huntail, and Pupitar should your team need it.</p> <p>Regardless of the EV spread chosen for this set, Hitmonchan remains a major threat, as it can easily OHKO Lickitung with Sky Uppercut, even if Lickitung is running a fully physically defensive spread. Chimecho, Haunter, Swalot, or Pelipper is a required teammate if using Lickitung to assuage this issue. Physically defensive Pokemon like Pelipper and Relicanth love Lickitung as a teammate, as Lickitung can wall nearly every Electric-, Grass-, and Water-type attacker in the tier effectively, giving them a solid backbone to fall back on and pivot around, and Lickitung can pass them Wishes because they lack solid recovery of their own. Unfortunately for Lickitung, Rain Dance Huntail can 2HKO it with Hydro Pump, even with a fully specially defensive EV spread, but Lickitung can effectively stall it out if it hits Huntail with Toxic as it uses Rain Dance and continues to cycle with Wish and Protect. This should be a last resort strategy for dealing with Huntail when using a stall team, however, so a primary answer is needed, making specially defensive Bellossom a desired teammate.</p> <p>If using a physically defensive spread, a specially defensive teammate like Swalot or Whiscash is recommended; Swalot in particular can still wall Hitmonchan effectively if it's running a specially defensive EV spread. Spikes support makes this set much more effective, as Lickitung can force out a lot of Pokemon and, combined with Toxic, really build up passive damage. Roselia is the best in this regard, as it resists Fighting unlike Cacturne and Glalie, and it is the best fit for the kinds of stall teams you would be using Lickitung on.</p>"

In addition, the move lets Rhyhorn maximize its passive recovery from Leftovers. 204 HP and 20 Defense EVs give Rhyhorn enough bulk to generally avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Aipom's Brick Break and survive Swords Dance Anorith's boosted Brick Break. 136 Speed EVs let Rhyhorn outspeed uninvested base 40 Speed Pokemon like Gloom and Porygon, Corsola, and bulky Clamperl variants. The rest of Rhyhorn's EVs are funneled into Attack to maximize its damage output.</p> <p>Rhyhorn is a good fit for bulky offense teams to shore up their defensive backbones against physical attackers, and it doesn't exacerbate passivity issues like Lileep and Onix would. Specially bulky Pokemon like Gloom and Porygon can compensate for Rhyhorn's vulnerability to special attackers, and Rhyhorn returns the favor to them by checking physical attackers they would otherwise struggle against. Castform is especially good against weather users like Ponyta, and it manages Hidden Power Grass variants of Ponyta for Rhyhorn too. Ariados handles Gloom, a major threat to Rhyhorn, while Rhyhorn can switch into and pressure Doduo and Anorith for it. Baton Pass Ariados variants further support Rhyhorn, pivoting to it after drawing in vulnerable Rock-types like Onix, weakened Corsola looking to heal up, and Anorith. Fast attackers like Ponyta and Quilava enjoy the holes Rhyhorn opens up in teams relying on bulky Water-types like Seaking and Wartortle, as such holes enable them to more easily clean up. Additionally, both of these Fire-types offensively threaten Grass-types like Tropius and Gloom for Rhyhorn. Rhyhorn is vulnerable to Water-types and Water-type moves given its 4x weakness and poor special bulk, so Seaking, Gloom, and Chinchou pair very well with it. Koffing hard walls Rhyhorn, which can be mitigated by partners like defensive Ariados, Seaking, and Wartortle.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Rhydon is hard to use, but can prove effective. While it does have several glaring weaknesses, it also possesses awesome attacking potential and crucial resistances to Normal, Rock, and Flying. It does a great job at countering Normal-types and can work around Skarmory and Weezing; it's even immune to Thunder Wave. However, it has trouble against the common bulky Water-types. Rhydon greatly appreciates paralysis support from the likes of Body Slam Snorlax and Thunder Wave Blissey, as this allows the Choice Band set to stay in and 2HKO the Water-types that can otherwise take it out, and enables the Substitute variant to fish for full paralysis and set up safely.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar works against Snorlax to an extent, as does Curse, but Swords Dance is preferred as Rhydon's typing is so poor defensively that it needs to take down opponents as quickly as it can. Counter is great against users of Fighting- and Ground-type moves as Rhydon can usually survive at least one of these. However, this strategy won't work against opponents that play it safe and switch to a special attacker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert are probably the best counters to Rhydon. If it doesn't have Megahorn, Celebi and Claydol trump it. Weezing and Skarmory also do well in general. Prediction is your best bet, as Rhydon can do more than 40% to any Pokemon. However, conversely, Rhydon is easily taken down by any special attack.</p>",

However, if you need Rhydon for its resistances, use a different set, as this one lacks Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>Focus Punch hurts Skarmory and Double-Edge provides a 100% accurate option against Weezing. Hidden Power Rock can reliably take down Flying-types; it actually does more damage on average than either Rock Blast or Rock Slide do. Furthermore, Rhydon can't take much advantage of Rock Slide's flinch chance due to its low Speed; it doesn't even much mind being phazed out by Skarmory, so even that benefit is lost.</p> <p>Choice Band is a good item for Rhydon because most of its switch-ins are Pokemon such as Suicune and Zapdos, who are faster and can easily OHKO it. Rhydon therefore often plays as a hit-and-run Pokemon, so it rarely notices the locking effect of the Choice Band.</p>"},

      "overview": "<p>Not only is Tangela a very threatening offensive Pokemon in the tier, it's also one of the better defensive stalwarts available, giving it a nice pedestal to stand on over many other similar choices. Offensively, Tangela and Bellossom can be considered rivals somewhat; while Tangela boasts slightly higher Speed and power and much better physical bulk to make end-game sweeping easier, Bellossom has much, much better special bulk to take better advantage of its typing against major metagame threats like Huntail and is therefore easier to fit on teams. Defensively, Tangela has few rivals when it comes to physical bulk; it's almost unmatched in its ability to wall Rock-types (outside of not resisting Explosion), and it easily checks the likes of other huge physical threats like Hitmonchan and Raticate. Regardless of whether Tangela is running an offensive or defensive set, Sleep Powder will be its ace in the hole, crippling many Pokemon in the tier. All in all, Tangela holds a very secure spot as one of the top Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tangela has access to Growth, which on paper sounds awesome on the Sunny Day sweeper set, but it only gives +1 to Special Attack and it won't do anything to help Tangela get past its main counters in Swalot, Flareon, and Kecleon. A more effective set that was not included above is a SubSeed set, which Tangela can actually pull off pretty effectively with its decent Speed stat and high Defense, made even better with its low HP stat. However, defensive Tangela will tend to get more mileage out of spreading status, and a SubSeed set is even more walled by Roselia than just the defensive set.</p> <p>More gimmicky options include a RestTalk set, which can make Tangela very hard for opposing defensive teams to take on, but Tangela has massive four-moveslot syndrome as it is; making room for both Rest and Sleep Talk will leave Tangela completely walled by a huge number of Pokemon while not walling much more than it otherwise would in return. Tangela's Attack is pretty terrible, but it does get Endure and Flail, which can surprise a couple of its common specially defensive counters while it cannot be walled by Rock-types in return thanks to its Grass STAB. Finally, Psych Up can allow Tangela to get the jump on a Calm Mind-boosted Chimecho or Sableye, but it doesn't have much use outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Swalot, especially specially defensive RestTalk variants, is the most surefire counter to any set Tangela may be running, as it's not even 4HKOed by anything Tangela can throw at it apart from Hidden Power Psychic (which is never seen), and it isn't fazed by any status Tangela can inflict, even passively harming Tangela throwing out Giga Drain and Leech Seed with its ability Liquid Ooze. Next in line are Fire-types, particularly Flareon and Torkoal, which accomplish pretty much the same as Swalot minus packing Liquid Ooze but gaining power to their STAB moves under Sunny Day. Venomoth and Roselia are practically immune to Tangela's Grass-type STAB attacks and can put the hurt on Tangela with Hidden Power Fire, but they will take a lot of damage from Tangela's own Hidden Power Fire in return.</p> <p>Pidgeot and Murkrow resist Tangela's Grass-type attacks, and Murkrow is even immune to Sleep Powder, but they need to be healthy to effectively take on Tangela under the sun, as Solar Beam will still be doing a ton of damage to both. Haunter is even frailer than those Flying-types but still resists Grass and will cleanly OHKO Tangela in return, which neither Flying-type can cleanly accomplish, though Murkrow almost always will with Drill Peck if Tangela is running 0 HP EVs. Finally, Glalie doesn't resist Solar Beam and will take a ton of damage from Hidden Power Fire, but it will easily OHKO Tangela in return with Ice Beam.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Sunny Day Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>This set is best brought out in the end-game, when most of the opponent's specially defensive Pokemon have been worn down and most users of Ice- and Fire-type attacks have been removed. Sleep Powder is what makes this set as dangerous as it is, completely invalidating a Pokemon late in the game and opening up an opportunity for Tangela to set up Sunny Day. From there, Solar Beam will hit like a wrecking ball, with Hidden Power Fire complementing it almost perfectly. It should be mentioned that Morning Sun is a viable option in the second moveslot to make the most of Tangela's bulk and sustain its sweep, especially if you already have a sleep inducer elsewhere on your team.</p> <p>There are many different viable EV spreads to consider when using Tangela. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature is recommended, as the base 50 and base 60 Speed tiers are heavily contested, and winning the Speed tie outside of sun could be game-changing. With maximum Speed and a Modest nature, Tangela will outrun Timid Bellossom by one point, allowing Tangela to keep its power level while giving it the possibility to beat Bellossom one-on-one if the latter is partially damaged beforehand. However, with a Modest nature, Tangela is left outsped by Jolly Pupitar by two points and will be outsped by other dangerous neutral-nature base 65 Speed Pokemon like Flareon and Chimecho. Therefore, Timid is the preferred nature, giving Tangela the ability to outspeed these threats as well as Pokemon with base 70 Speed and a neutral nature like Castform, along with giving Tangela the best possible chance of beating other Tangela under the sun. A bulkier spread is also efficient and pairs best with Morning Sun. Just 24 Speed EVs are needed with a Modest nature to outpace the entire unboosted tier under the sun; the remaining EVs should be put into HP to give Tangela some bulk to ease setup. It's important to keep in mind, though, that Tangela will have almost no chance of beating Flareon regardless of EV spread outside of crippling it with Sleep Powder, and Tangela can only hope to beat Bellossom that have taken upwards of 25% damage; Tangela will otherwise fail to KO with Hidden Power Fire under the sun and Bellossom will always have a guaranteed OHKO back.</p> <p>There's very little that can stand in Tangela's path once the sun is up, but there are a few immediate threats that must be taken care of before successfully sweeping with Tangela, most notably including Flareon and Torkoal. Both avoid even a 4HKO from Tangela's attacks and easily OHKO in return with Flamethrower, meaning even if they are hit by Sleep Powder at full health, Tangela has almost no chance of KOing them before they wake up. These two make Diglett a very valuable teammate to employ to ensure they are removed before attempting to sweep with Tangela, but Diglett can be pretty hard to use. Other choices include Rock-types like Sudowoodo, Water-types like Dewgong, and other Pokemon to lure them in and cripple them with Toxic. Specially defensive Swalot completely walls this set, it too avoiding a 4HKO from any of Tangela's moves and easily KOing back with either Sludge Bomb or Ice Beam. Diglett again comes in handy here for taking it out, while other Ground-types like Graveler or a Psychic-type like Chimecho can be used to try to knock it out before bringing out Tangela. Finally, specially defensive Kecleon and Lickitung are only 3HKOed by Tangela's attacks, making a physically inclined partner like Hitmonchan a valuable teammate to take them out ahead of time.</p> <p>Spikes support will ensure that Tangela will come out on top against a myriad of other Pokemon in the tier, including Hitmonchan, Bellossom, and Venomoth, ensuring an OHKO on the latter after a layer of Spikes and getting super close after two layers on the former two. Other Pokemon that need to be weakened before bringing out Tangela include Haunter, Chimecho, Murkrow, and Pidgeot, all of which can tank any one of Tangela's moves and all of which but Pidgeot can OHKO back after a layer of Spikes.</p>"
        },
        "Physically Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>65/115 physical bulk is amazing on a Pokemon that resists Earthquake in the NU tier, and Tangela puts that bulk to use with this set. Between Giga Drain and Leech Seed, Tangela will usually be getting enough health back to not warrant the use of Morning Sun, but the instant recovery is useful in certain situations. Double status is a good strategy to use with Tangela in order to cripple as much of the opponent's team as possible. Stun Spore is best used if your team needs Tangela to be able to cripple offensive Pokemon like Arbok, Vigoroth, and Murkrow. Toxic is better on teams with multiple RestTalk or Protect users to stall for Toxic damage and better allow Tangela to help the team come out on top against stall cores of Sableye, Flareon, and Dewgong.</p> <p>Giga Drain is the recommended STAB move thanks to its passive healing; however, its PP is really low, meaning Hidden Power Grass is a good alternative that has a bonus of being slightly stronger. Leech Seed is the main option in the last slot to increase Tangela's overall longevity and spread more residual damage around the opposite team. Toxic can be used here as well, which makes Tangela much less susceptible to Grass-types save for Roselia.</p> <p>There's not much point to running Special Defense EVs, as Bellossom just does a specially defensive set a million times better. Some Speed can be run to allow Tangela to hit some other defensive Pokemon with Sleep Powder before they can status Tangela in return, though Tangela typically wants maximum Defense to tank attacks from the likes of Hitmonchan better. Hidden Power Fire can be used in the last slot with Giga Drain to ward off Grass-, Bug-, and Steel-types looking for an easy switch into Tangela. Tangela also has access to Reflect, which can make it nigh impregnable physically and possibly allow Tangela to turn the tides against a Flying-type switch-in such as Murkrow. Hidden Power Ice is a good offensive option if going this route to turn Tangela into a lure to open a sweep for something weak to Flying-types such as Hitmonchan. Finally, Protect is a decent option to include somewhere on this set to allow Tangela to scout the opponent's attacks, rack up passive damage, and stall for more Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery.</p> <p>Swalot completely mangles this set thanks to its huge Special Defense, resistance to Grass, and ability in Liquid Ooze, which turns Leech Seed into a hindrance for Tangela and its teammates. This makes Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates to have to switch into Swalot and other Poison-types to threaten them out with a STAB Earthquake. Chimecho is also a good teammate to have for this reason, and it also helps immensely with combating opposing Roselia, which can otherwise switch into this set without fear and shrug off any status with Natural Cure.</p> <p>In general, defensive Tangela should be used as part of a defensive core and thus needs a specially defensive teammate to work effectively for the team. Kecleon, Flareon, and Dewgong make great teammates to accomplish this and pair well with Tangela typing-wise. Dewgong is particularly effective for taking on Fire-types and can tank attacks from the common Flying-types as well if need be. Having Spikes support will increase the effectiveness of the passive damage Tangela will spread around the opposing team with Toxic and Leech Seed, and all of its moves tend to cause switches, which will rack up damage. Finally, because Tangela almost completely walls most Ground- and Rock-types, having a late-game sweeper that can take advantage of their absence is best to have along, with examples including Plusle, Pidgeot, and Raticate.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is one of the most used Pokemon in the UnderUsed environment. Bulky defenses, high HP, above-average Speed, high Attack with a fantastic movepool and Normal STAB makes Kangaskhan very dangerous. Kangaskhan can be difficult to stop; more than one resist is often necessary to handle it. When building your UU team, make sure that your team can handle Kangaskhan!</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used as your Normal move for Paralysis. Roar can stop random stat uppers, especially the odd UU BP team (as Mr. Mime cannot stand up to STAB Returns to block your Roar), and Yawn works as a sort of pseudo-phazing move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Near max HP and a lot of Attack in the first set, with the rest in Speed. On the Choice Band set, just max out Attack and Speed. On the Reversal set, max out Attack to ensure that Reversal can do a decent amount of damage. Speed will have to be 264 in OU, with an Adamant nature, but in UU, you can use much lower speeds, such as 251 to beat an Electrode without +Speed, or even less, depending on just how much you fear Electrode. The remainder of EVs should go into either Defense. Use no HP EVs so that you end up with 1% after 4 Substitutes, instead of 25% after 3, or Reversal will be much weaker. Of course, the extra EVs elsewhere will do virtually nothing, so you'll most likely just want to max your Speed to keep other Salac Pokemon from outspeeding you.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Often more than one Rock-type is needed to fully stop Kangaskhan. A bulky Omastar can handle it, Reflect Solrock can handle it. Golem, which is rather uncommon, can switch into it and scare off Kangaskhan, unless it is of course packing Earthquake or Focus Punch. Walrein and Blastoise can easily stall it with Rest and Toxic, unless it's holding a Choice Band. If it has a Choice Band, you'll need to use resists.</p>",

Return or Shadow Ball anything in sight until your HP is at around 50%. Then Rest the damage off and wait for one Sleep turn, thanks to Early Bird. Kangaskhan can also use Double-Edge effectively. Wish is also an option; with some defensive EVs, Kangaskhan can be bulky, which will allow it to be an effective Wish-passer. Watch out for status.</p>"},
        "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Kangaskhan is no Slaking, but it can act as a Choice Bander quite well. Its Speed is rather high in UU to pull this off. Because Focus Punch hits very few things in UU, Fake Out can be used to stop Pokemon with Substitute and a Salac, or just for a little bit of extra damage against a Pokemon you normally couldn't take. However, Focus Punch can be useful to predict Walrein and Cradily, and guarantees an OHKO on Aggron, who can potentially survive your Earthquake only to Counter it back.</p>"},
        "Wish Staller": {"description": "<p>This set simply refuses to die, as very few things can do enough to Kangaskhan to overcome Wish and 2 turns of Leftovers for each hit, and those few Pokemon (for instance, Hitmonlee) often have very low Defense, letting your STAB Normal hit them hard. It's completely walled by Aggron, but Wish support lets Pokemon like Gligar switch into that all day. Counter can stop that nicely, but you risk being Thunder Waved or having Aggron just set up a Substitute. You could also stick Roar on there over Protect or Return if you have some Spikes down for even more stall. You may want to focus on more Special Defense if you have Counter to ensure that Counter KOs the opponent when they use a physical attack.</p>"},
        "SubPunch": {"description": "<p>105 base Hit Points and a decent Attack make this moveset very good on Kangaskhan. Make sure when you are using this set, to make sure you have 404 HP or more (at least 212 HP EVs) to make 101 HP Substitutes, as this means Seismic Toss will need two hits to break the Substitute.</p>"},
        "Reversal": {"description": "<p>Flail would have worked better, actually. If you think about it, Flail would save some room for Focus Punch. Too bad, though. The Reversaler set is in fact the unexpected set for Kangaskhan.</p>"}

It's very one-dimensional, but a decent choice for high offense teams. Most other Water-types in the tier are too weak, too slow, or need setup to be useful, and Seadra is just good right off the bat. However, it's relatively easy to wall and has no way of breaking its usual counters, as it doesn't have a way of boosting its attacks outside of Rain Dance, which doesn't give it a Speed boost, unlike its main competition in Huntail. All in all, Seadra is a great choice, just make sure Huntail isn't a better choice for your team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There really isn't much more for Seadra to do, as its movepool is pretty barren. Rain Dance is an option to boost its STAB attacks and form a dual-sweeping core with Huntail. Blizzard offers more power than Ice Beam and can make Bellossom a more risky switch-in to Seadra, but the accuracy just kills it as a reliable option. Finally, Hidden Power Dark gives Seadra a super effective hit on Chimecho.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Specially defensive Bellossom is probably the best answer to Seadra available, as it can withstand an Ice Beam or two and proceed to OHKO Seadra back with any of its STAB moves. Dewgong is the next best answer, as it is avoids the 3HKO from Hidden Power and can proceed to 2HKO back if it's carrying its own Hidden Power or 3HKO with Surf or Ice Beam. Specially defensive Lickitung, Swalot, and Kecleon are the next best answers, as they are not threatened by a 2HKO from any of Seadra's moves and can proceed to stall it out. Finally, Seadra is relatively easily revenge killed by most Pokemon with neutral or super effective special attacks. Plusle and Haunter both outspeed Seadra and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Roselia can tank an Ice Beam and OHKO with Giga Drain. Maximum Special Attack Chimecho can easily OHKO with Hidden Power Electric and tank a Hydro Pump.</p>",

While Huntail is more powerful and faster in rain, Seadra does not need to rely on rain being active in order to outspeed a huge portion of the metagame and blast foes with its STAB move, making it a bit more reliable in that regard. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is the age-old story of power vs accuracy. Hydro Pump is generally preferred due to the chance to break through defensive stalwarts like Swalot and Lickitung; however, the tier is pretty specially frail on the whole, making Surf a decent option.</p> <p>Ice Beam and either Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Electric give Seadra almost perfect neutral coverage on the tier, which Seadra is thankful for because it really does not have a movepool outside of that, making the last slot somewhat of a filler option. Substitute is nice to protect Seadra from being revenge killed by the likes of Plusle and Haunter, and it can be used with a Petaya or Salac Berry to give Seadra an extra boost to possibly sweep the opposing team. Toxic is a great way to cripple the special walls that can tank its attacks well, particularly Kecleon and Bellossom. Finally, Agility can turn the tables on the opponent late-game and let Seadra outrun even Huntail in the rain.</p> <p>A Timid nature is needed to let Seadra outspeed Glalie and the rare Fire-types that sit near its Speed tier, like Charmeleon and Magby. Modest is still a choice though if you're looking for straight power and is recommended if you're using Hydro Pump. Speaking of power, Mystic Water can be used to give Seadra's Water-type STAB move a bit more bite and ensures a 2HKO on physically defensive Swalot with Hydro Pump and 2HKO on Choice Band Hitmonchan with Surf. Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Electric to nail Whiscash, but Electric is generally better, as it provides better neutral coverage and has a more desirable super effective hit on Pelipper.</p> <p>Spikes is central to hyper offense teams, making Roselia, Glalie, and Cacturne required teammates, with Roselia in particular sporting great type synergy with Seadra. Bellossom is a huge threat to this set, as it is tanky enough to withstand Ice Beam and easily OHKOes Seadra with any of its STAB moves. Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like Flareon are thus good offensive teammates to pair with Seadra, as they can take advantage of Bellossom and OHKO it, and in Flareon's case, enjoy a nice Sunny Day boost as well should Bellossom choose to set up. Plusle and Haunter are the main revenge killers to watch out for when using this set, making a special tank a recommended teammate; Chimecho is a good team choice, as it can continue to pressure the opponent with offensive Calm Mind sets. Finally, Hitmonchan is a great offensive partner to blow through a few of the special walls that stand in Seadra's way, while Seadra soaks the physical walls that give Hitmonchan some trouble.</p>"

Megahorn drills through specially bulky Pokemon such as Castform, Drowzee, and Lileep, and it's stronger and more reliable than Hydro Pump against Mightyena if Seaking hasn't been affected by Intimidate. Hidden Power Rock nails Noctowl and Dustox; lacks the shaky accuracy of Hydro Pump to reliably hit Ponyta, Anorith, and Quilava; and keeps Seaking threatening to certain Swords Dance sweepers like Beedrill and Tentacool.

          "description": "<p>Seaking's high Attack and solid movepool make it a threatening wallbreaker and lead. Double-Edge is Seaking's most spammable attack, something helped by the rarity of Normal-resistant foes in ZU. Megahorn targets Grass-types, though its use is limited by the fact that ZU's best Grass-types, Tropius and Gloom, are neutral to Bug and thus take the same amount of damage from Double-Edge; in general, Megahorn provides an equally powerful attack as Double-Edge with no recoil, a midground in the event the opponent switches to a Pokemon that resists Normal, and the ability to 2HKO all variants of Mightyena. Hydro Pump OHKOes Rock-types such as Rhyhorn and Anorith and Ground-types such as Cubone, and it is Seaking's strongest move against certain physical walls such as Koffing. Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes an unboosted Corsola, preventing it from switching into Seaking. Water Veil is used to prevent Seaking from being crippled by Will-O-Wisp from foes such as Koffing and burns from Fire-type attacks from foes such as Ponyta and Quilava.</p> <p>Seaking best fits on offense and balance teams looking for a threatening wallbreaker with few true walls. While it is best used in the lead slot, it is not confined in such a role and can be used in the back on teams with another Choice Band user or another dedicated lead. Corsola is Seaking's hardest check, with it having reliable recovery while not being 2HKOed by any of its moves barring Hidden Power Grass. Once Corsola sets up Calm Mind, Seaking is helpless against it. Thus, checks to Corsola such as Flaafy, Tropius, and Gloom make for great partners. Seaking struggles against Grass-types such as Gloom and Tropius, making it appreciate the support of teammates such as Ponyta, Quilava, and one's own Tropius. In return, Seaking is an effective check to aforementioned Fire-types themselves. Speedy offensive foes such as Elekid, Abra, Choice Band Aipom, and Choice Band Doduo can outspeed and KO Seaking, making bulky Pokemon such as the aforementioned Grass-types, Mightyena, and Corsola good teammates. Seaking can be used on sun teams, with it acting as an effective check to special walls and Fire-types.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Starmie is a formidable late-game threat and a reliable Rapid Spin user thanks to its blazing Speed, powerful Hydro Pump, and useful coverage. The only common threats that can outspeed it are Jolly Dugtrio, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. Starmie's presence forces faster-paced teams to carry revenge killers or checks that can withstand two hits, while slower teams are forced on the back foot as Starmie removes their Spikes on a forced switch to a passive special wall. This cements Starmie's placement on Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams as a spinner and late-game cleaner.</p> <p>Thanks to Recover and Natural Cure, Starmie can also run a bulky Rapid Spin set to repeatedly remove Spikes throughout the game. Starmie's main competitors as a spinner -- Claydol and Forretress -- struggle against status, residual damage, and Skarmory, although Starmie still dislikes Toxic. A bulky Starmie can also check common Pokemon such as offensive Swampert, Metagross, Cloyster, Breloom, Moltres, and Charizard. Additionally, Starmie can pair with other Natural Cure users like Blissey and Celebi to absorb status, pressuring status-reliant walls like Milotic, Swampert, and Blissey.</p> <p>Starmie is held back by its inability to play offense and defense simultaneously. Offensive variants cannot switch directly into attacks; are easily revenge killed by Aerodactyl and Jolly Dugtrio; must land the imperfectly accurate Hydro Pump against dangerous foes such as Magneton, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Swampert; and struggle to muscle through defensive answers such as Snorlax, Celebi, Jirachi, and especially Blissey without sand and Spikes. On the other hand, defensive Starmie is quite passive and setup fodder for Pokemon such as Celebi, Snorlax, Suicune, Heracross, Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, and Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados. Starmie's bulk and defensive typing are poor, forcing even bulky variants to use Recover often, and it is easily put into KO range of Pursuit Tyranitar’s Crunch and Cloyster’s Explosion through chip damage like sand and Spikes. Starmie's competition as a spinner in Claydol and Forretress have much higher bulk and utility; both are immune to sand and Claydol is immune to Spikes. Starmie is also vulnerable to mind games against teams with Gengar and Toxic + Protect Skarmory, which can spinblock while Toxic wears it down.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Starmie has other niche options for its last moveslot. Hidden Power Grass guarantees a 2HKO on Swampert without having to use Hydro Pump while also hitting the rare Lanturn. Surf can be run alongside Hydro Pump to accurately hit Pokemon that will KO Starmie if Hydro Pump misses, such as weakened Metagross, Magneton, or Aerodactyl. Thunder over Thunderbolt can be used to hit Skarmory much harder and 2HKO Milotic in sand, which will otherwise stall out Starmie with Toxic and Recover, but beware of its low accuracy. It also generally hits Electric-weak threats like Skarmory much harder than Thunderbolt. On the defensive set, the most prominent alternative option is Toxic. Its forced damage is sometimes more valuable than Thunder Wave, helping beat Swampert more easily and eventually forcing Blissey out. However, Skarmory, Gengar, and Forretress are immune to it, making Toxic Starmie worse as a spinner. Starmie also has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, which can assist teammates and let it withstand Explosion or Pursuit from Tyranitar. However, Starmie can only fit one screen without getting too passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Even offensive Starmie will make little progress against special walls like Blissey, Snorlax, defensive Jirachi, specially defensive Celebi, and even Regice and Registeel. Blissey is the best Starmie counter. Snorlax and Regice are less bulky but can take multiple hits and respond with powerful attacks. Jirachi and Celebi can heal and 2HKO back with Electric-type coverage or Hidden Power Grass. However, Celebi needs to be careful, as Ice Beam forces repeated Recover uses. Registeel takes little damage from anything Starmie can do. While these Pokemon wall the defensive set easily, they allow Starmie to spin for free, while some such as Blissey and Registeel are quite passive and invite in dangerous physical Pokemon like Tyranitar, Metagross, Snorlax, and Fighting-types.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon, Zapdos, Lanturn, and Raikou can tank a hit from offensive Starmie and easily remove both variants with Thunderbolt. Jolteon outspeeds all Starmie variants, whereas Raikou can Speed tie with Starmie. Both are bulky enough to take one hit after three Spikes layers, while Raikou can sometimes take Hydro Pump twice from full HP. Lanturn easily takes on Starmie's coverage. Zapdos is the only prominent Starmie check immune to Spikes, but it can't outspeed offensive Starmie; bulky sets can take Ice Beam twice, while offensive sets can take any attack once and remove Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Offensive Starmie's damage output often makes switching in quite hard, but upon sacrificing a Pokemon, a healthy or faster check can switch in and remove Starmie. Jolly Dugtrio and Aerodactyl only need a small amount of chip damage to remove Starmie without bulk investment, whereas Swampert and Metagross can survive Hydro Pump at reasonable health and hit hard in return. In desperate situations, maximum HP Tyranitar can take Timid offensive Starmie's Hydro Pump and hit hard with Hidden Power Bug or OHKO back with Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gengar and Dusclops can spinblock Starmie. Gengar can also hit Starmie hard with Thunderbolt, OHKOing offensive Starmie if Gengar has significant Special Attack investment. However, both Starmie sets can greatly threaten Gengar; if Gengar switches in on anything but Rapid Spin, it will be KOed by the ensuing Hydro Pump or Psychic from offensive Starmie, whereas the defensive set can cripple it with Thunder Wave or hit it with Psychic. Dusclops is rare but is much bulkier than Gengar, not weak to Psychic, and able to retaliate with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup Pokemon that can shrug off status and Surf can use defensive Starmie as setup fodder. Examples include Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi, Curse Snorlax, Taunt or Rest + Dragon Dance Gyarados if Starmie lacks Thunderbolt, and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi. These Pokemon, especially Calm Mind Jirachi, Curse Snorlax, and Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune, often heavily threaten teams Starmie finds itself on.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Checks</strong>: Defensive Starmie can do little damage to bulky Water answers such as Milotic and Celebi and is completely walled by Vaporeon. Against offensive Starmie, these checks can bait out a weaker coverage move like Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to switch into a teammate that can't take Hydro Pump twice.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pursuit Tyranitar can KO defensive Starmie after some damage and is commonly found on teams with Forretress lacking Hidden Power Bug, but it is 2HKOed by Surf and takes heavy damage from offensive Starmie's Hydro Pump. Umbreon can more reliably Pursuit trap Starmie thanks to its high special bulk and Toxic, but it cannot KO a healthy Starmie with Pursuit. It is also exploited by much of the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross can easily OHKO Starmie and only needs a small amount of bulk to take any Psychic. Heracross can also set up Substitute and Swords Dance on defensive Starmie, while Guts Heracross does not mind taking Thunder Wave to become even more powerful.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is a must despite its unreliability, as it can potentially OHKO Claydol, can OHKO Tyranitar that don't invest heavily in bulk, has a chance to 2HKO Forretress, and always 2HKOes Gengar. With Spikes, Starmie becomes even harder to check, wearing down defensive Jirachi; threatening a 2HKO on Metagross and a 3HKO on Snorlax; and guaranteeing an OHKO on Tyranitar. Ice Beam hits Salamence, Zapdos, and Venusaur hard while forcing Celebi to repeatedly use Recover, whereas Thunderbolt nails Skarmory and Water-types like Milotic, Suicune, Gyarados, Vaporeon, and opposing Starmie.</p> <p>Starmie has multiple options for its last move. Rapid Spin works as an emergency removal for Spikes on a forced switch. It is also quite effective in faster paced games such as those against Jolteon Spikes, as Starmie only needs to spin once. Since this Starmie is offensive, do not expect it to spin multiple times. Additionally, it can't afford to be spinblocked, as Gengar will take Hydro Pump and potentially KO back with Thunderbolt. Psychic is a nice option for Gengar and Venusaur as well as Fighting-types such as Heracross, Hariyama, and Breloom. Specifically, it can KO specially bulky Gengar with some prior damage and gives Starmie reason to switch into Gengar's Ice Punch, Taunt, or Will-O-Wisp. It also lets Starmie threaten an OHKO on Breloom and chipped Heracross without bulk investment and a 2HKO on bulky Heracross and Hariyama. Recover negates chip damage if the team already has a spinner or does not value Psychic's coverage. It allows Starmie to absorb status with Natural Cure and repeatedly force out Moltres, mixed Salamence, and Charizard. Starmie can also drop one of its coverage moves to run both Recover and Rapid Spin to give it more reliability as a spinner. It switches into Blissey early-game, as it doesn't give up momentum and shrugs off Blissey's attacks barring Thunderbolt. Offensive Starmie almost always have maximum Speed to outpace everything up to Salac Berry-boosted Swampert. Starmie can run a Modest nature to OHKO maximum HP Tyranitar and more likely 2HKO Skarmory. This is often done if using Starmie without Spikes or alongside support for removing Gengar.</p> <p>Starmie should be brought in only at opportune moments such as predicted switches, when a Pokemon faints, or resisted moves from something it threatens out, like Moltres, Gengar, or Claydol. Beware of trying to use it to check Skarmory and Forretress early-game, especially if Skarmory has Toxic and Protect or Forretress has Hidden Power Bug; this often leads to a situation where one layer of Spikes is still up and Starmie is too low on HP to perform properly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie needs specific support to cleave through teams. First and foremost, Tyranitar's sand helps make residual damage stick for easier sweeping, and Starmie can threaten out sand-immune Rock- and Ground-types with Hydro Pump and 2HKO most Steel-types bar defensive Jirachi and Registeel. Tyranitar is also a fantastic switch-in to Blissey, Snorlax, and defensive Jirachi without Hidden Power Fighting or Toxic. It can also use Focus Punch on Swampert and Metagross, weakening them for Starmie's Hydro Pump. Other strong attackers can fill this niche as well, such as Metagross, Focus Punch Swampert, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Another way to use Starmie is to control the Spikes game: keep up more Spikes than the opponent. Good Spikes users include Skarmory and Forretress, although Cloyster and Smeargle are niche options for faster paced teams. Skarmory is the most common choice thanks to its defensive utility. Gengar is also nice on these teams, as it is the best spinblocker and can help remove special walls with Explosion or use Taunt + Will-O-Wisp to prevent them from healing. Another option to keep the Spikes advantage is to use Claydol alongside Starmie, which frees Starmie up to run Psychic or Recover, provides a Rock resistance, and threatens special walls with Explosion. Due to Starmie's defensive liabilities, it commonly prefers defensive teammates on Spikes teams, such as strong special walls like Blissey and Jirachi and good physical walls such as Swampert, defensive Metagross, and Flygon. These options often make up the core of common Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams alongside Tyranitar, Gengar, and Skarmory.</p> <p>To further support Starmie, Explosion users like Gengar, Weezing, and Regice can lure in Blissey and often weaken it enough so that Dugtrio or residual damage can finish it off. Even without Explosion, Dugtrio is a fantastic partner with a good Blissey lure like Baton Pass Zapdos; Beat Up Dugtrio can easily remove it, defensive Jirachi, and Celebi. Additionally, other staples of special offense such as Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi, offensive Swampert, mixed Metagross, Calm Mind Jirachi, Calm Mind Suicune, and Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar weaken special checks for a Starmie sweep. Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is particularly synergetic, as it can pass Calm Mind to Starmie to more easily muscle past its checks.</p> <p>Strong Fighting-types like Hariyama, Heracross, Breloom, Machamp, and Medicham are especially good alongside Starmie, as they help punch through bulky Normal-types like Blissey and Snorlax. They work especially well alongside Recover + Rapid Spin Starmie, as they can repeatedly fire off Focus Punch into Toxic + Protect Skarmory, while Starmie beats Drill Peck versions. Starmie is also a nice check to Salamence, a common Fighting answer.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Starmie is one of OU's three consistent spinners and checks many dangerous threats with its speed, Recover, and Water / Psychic typing.</p> <p>With maximum HP investment and Recover, Starmie is bulky enough to repeatedly remove Spikes. Running 40 Special Attack EVs guarantees a 2HKO on maximum HP Tyranitar with Surf, while 216 Speed EVs with a Timid nature beat Gengar, only falling short of opposing Starmie, Salac Berry-boosted Swampert, and Raikou. In the last moveslot, Starmie has several options. The most prominent of these is Thunder Wave; Thunder Wave paralyzes dangerous setup threats not bothered by Starmie's weak Surf, like Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragon Dance Gyarados without Taunt, and Calm Mind Jirachi. It also cripples bulky Pokemon like Toxic + Protect Skarmory and slows down Speed-reliant Pokemon like Zapdos and Gengar, making them easier to revenge kill if they KO Starmie and weaker in general. For other options, Psychic is fantastic against Gengar trying to spinblock and Fighting-types. Thunderbolt assists Starmie against Gyarados, Cloyster, and Skarmory. Ice Beam allows Starmie to be a strong Salamence, Flygon, and Breloom answer while being less passive against Zapdos and defensive Celebi. The best coverage choice generally depends on the team's major weaknesses, whereas Thunder Wave is the best for general purposes.</p> <p>Defensive Starmie generally competes with Claydol, as Forretress typically requires Pursuit support to handle Gengar. In comparison to Claydol, Starmie is easily chipped by sand and Spikes, lacks a Rock resistance, cannot directly remove threats such as Celebi, Suicune, and Salamence with Explosion, and struggles against Toxic Skarmory without Refresh. On the other hand, Starmie has good speed control, stronger coverage, Natural Cure, and Recover while beating all non-Toxic variants of Skarmory. These traits allow Starmie to survive throughout the game and even PP stall with its large amount of PP. Since Starmie is easily chipped by sand and Spikes, it is very vulnerable to Pursuit Tyranitar. Starmie isn't especially bulky either, often being forced into Recover loops against the various threats it checks with some chip damage, making it harder to spin should it be too cavalier with its health early-game.</p> <p>Starmie can run 32 Special Defense EVs to avoid an OHKO after sand damage from Pursuit Tyranitar. Additionally, Starmie can forgo the extra Special Attack EVs for maximum Speed investment to outrun Salac Berry-boosted Endeavor Swampert instead of spamming Recover as it uses Endeavor. Starmie can also run considerably less Speed depending on the team's needs, such as 176 Speed EVs to outrun Adamant Dugtrio; 136 Speed EVs for Salamence, Zapdos, and Charizard; 56 Speed EVs for Moltres; or even a Bold nature with heavy Defense investment to better check physical Tyranitar, Metagross, Swampert, and Aerodactyl. Starmie should run a minimum of 16 Speed EVs to outspeed Pokemon like Heracross and Suicune. How Starmie is played changes with different Speed investment; slower Starmie sets often are played similarly to Milotic, whereas faster Starmie sets are better against Spikes teams due to outspeeding Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Starmie typically fits on balanced teams that need Spikes removal and can afford its passivity. Due to Starmie's ability to defeat Spikes users other than Toxic + Protect Skarmory and Hidden Power Bug Forretress, Starmie teams typically beat Skarmory down with threats such as mixed Tyranitar and Salamence with Fire Blast instead of using Magneton. However, to afford Starmie's passivity, it commonly needs to be paired with strong physical and special switch-ins. Physically defensive Metagross with Protect can handle Snorlax and most Jirachi while generally tanking boosted threats such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Dragon Dance Gyarados, whereas Blissey or specially defensive Celebi deals with Suicune along with forming status pivots with Starmie for stalling out Milotic and defensive Jirachi. Pursuit Tyranitar can remove Gengar once Starmie has paralyzed it. Balanced teams struggle with Heracross and commonly carry Salamence or Gengar to switch into Megahorn. Starmie also fits well alongside Fighting-types like Medicham and especially well with those with Guts such as Hariyama, Heracross, and Machamp, as they can beat Toxic + Protect Skarmory and repeatedly fire off Focus Punch for free because such Skarmory will typically lack Drill Peck.</p> <p>Starmie can also pair with general Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes teammates such as Tyranitar, Swampert, Gengar, Blissey, and Skarmory; however, make sure that the team isn't too passive due to lacking a strong cleaner. These types of teams sometimes run Dugtrio for removing foes weakened by Spikes in longer games and prominent Starmie answers such as Calm Mind Celebi, Pursuit Tyranitar, and even paralyzed Blissey and Jirachi. Dugtrio can also trap Heracross, the one Fighting-type Starmie struggles against, and Starmie deals with Pokemon immune to Ground for Dugtrio such as Salamence, Gyarados, Charizard, and Moltres.</p> <p>As a niche option, defensive Starmie can work on paralysis focused teams with Pokemon such as Porygon2, defensive Jirachi, Thunder Wave Zapdos, and Snorlax. These types of teams commonly struggle with Spikes and benefit from the unique array of Pokemon Starmie can check, such as Moltres, Charizard, Swampert, and Metagross. However, Starmie should not be the only check to these Pokemon, as it can be easily overwhelmed. Still, this allows them to use more offensive lures to Skarmory, such as Choice Band Metagross and Guts Hariyama, Heracross, and Machamp. In addition, slow and powerful Pokemon such as Marowak, Substitute Tyranitar, Curse Swampert, and Rhydon fit well here. Marowak is especially nice, as it can provide a passable Rock resistance while heavily threatening most of the metagame.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Scyther is an excellent offensive Pokemon with one of the highest Speed stats in the tier and an exceptional base 110 Attack. It capitalizes on the progress made by its teammates, allowing it to function as a wallbreaker, revenge killer, cleaner, and sweeper. Scyther's sheer power with its STAB moves lets it 2HKO or 3HKO many relevant Pokemon, such as Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Ampharos, Solrock, and Vileplume. Swarm punishes any Pokemon swinging at it, as its bulk lets it dodge an OHKO from most neutral attacks, like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge. Scyther works very well on offense and balance teams that uphold Spikes pressure and need a backbone of fast offense and priority, and this makes it one of the best late-game Pokemon.</p> <p>Scyther can, however, have a lack of longevity, as it has weaknesses to common attacking types in Electric, Ice, Fire, and Rock, and it hates being statused by paralysis and Toxic. Choice Band sets can end up being reliant on prediction, and they can allow more Pokemon to gain entry. It can be hard to find entry for Scyther due to its reliance on being kept healthy late-game and its common switch-ins forcing its team to play on the defensive, only coming in through Ground-type moves, double switches, or revenge kills.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used on the Choice Band set over Hidden Power Ground to hit all of Cradily, Granbull, and Walrein on the switch in. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Flying-types like Altaria while maintaining coverage for Arcanine and Walrein as they switch in. Both Hidden Power choices lower Scyther's Speed IVs, which guarantees opposing base 105 Speed Pokemon can revenge kill it, so Hidden Power Ground, Bug, and Flying are preferable choices. On Reversal sets, Salac Berry can be substituted for Liechi Berry to make Reversal stronger, but this comes at the cost of risking the Speed tie against base 105 Speed foes and being too slow to avoid a revenge kill from Electrode and Ninjask.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar can comfortably switch into Scyther with its Normal and Flying resistances coupled with its sky-high Defense, and it can aptly pressure with Surf or lay down Spikes. Aggron and Golem pose similar problems and can OHKO Scyther with Rock STAB attacks. Although Aggron fears Hidden Power Ground, Omastar and Golem can tank it at least a few times. Other Rock-types like Cradily and Solrock can come in on moves they resist and threaten Scyther back, but they have trouble dealing with Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Altaria and Gligar can both defensively check Scyther with their great bulk, Bug-type resistance, and Spikes immunity while also offensively checking Scyther with super effective coverage. Altaria is very bulky and uses Scyther as an opportunity to use Heal Bell, and it can use Roar on Swords Dance Scyther, forcing it to start the process all over again. Gligar can gain turns to set up its own Swords Dance boosts, hits back hard with Hidden Power Flying, and has priority to beat Salac Reversal sets. Both still need to take caution against Choice Band variants, as Hidden Power Flying and Double-Edge can 2HKO Gligar and non-physically defensive Altaria.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is a mixed wall that zaps Scyther with a strong STAB Thunderbolt and can come in on Scyther's contact moves, potentially paralyzing it through Static. While other Electric-types lack Ampharos's bulk, they can Speed tie Scyther or outspeed in the case of Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Walrein</strong>: Walrein is a bulky wall that can threaten Scyther with its STAB Ice Beam, and it can phaze out any attempts of sweeping with Swords Dance through Encore or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Granbull and Arcanine’s Intimidate softens the blow of Scyther’s moves and forces Scyther's team to play on the defensive. Arcanine has a brutal STAB Fire Blast, resists Hidden Power Bug, and has priority to stuff any revenge kills at low health and stop Scyther from Reversal sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask can reliably revenge kill Scyther and can use their entry as an opportunity for their own offense.</p>",

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Scyther is the most common set for its immediate power and ability to revenge kill fast Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Tentacruel. Scyther also has an incredible max Speed of 339, which is only outsped by Electrode and Ninjask, rivaling its Choice Band user competition like Fearow, Nidoking, and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>Hidden Power Bug is Scyther's main STAB attack for hitting neutral targets and is very powerful when Scyther is in Swarm range. It also provides coverage for Psychic-types, like Slowking and Solrock, and it can be used as a way to avoid contact abilities like Static. Double-Edge provides a very powerful neutral hit to most targets, including Flying-types like Gligar and Altaria, and its recoil can be helpful in pushing Scyther into Swarm range for a boosted Hidden Power Bug. Aerial Ace hits opposing Scyther, Vileplume, Ghost-types like Haunter and Misdreavus, and Fighting-types like Hitmontop. Quick Attack provides very useful priority against Reversal sweepers like opposing Scyther, serves as an additional check to chipped weather sweepers like Sunny Day Vileplume and Rain Dance Gorebyss, and helps check other priority from Arcanine. Silver Wind and Hidden Power Flying can be used as alternatives to Hidden Power Bug and Aerial Ace. This gives Scyther less contact moves, a stronger Flying STAB attack, and access to possible omniboosts with Silver Wind. Using both Silver Wind and Aerial Ace allows Scyther to use another Hidden Power over Double-Edge, such as Hidden Power Ground for Arcanine and Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types that like to come in on Choice Band Scyther.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Scyther fits well onto Spikes offense with Omastar and Qwilfish. Spikes help Scyther break through bulky Pokemon more easily and wears down its checks as they switch in. Omastar is also a physical wall that can help to check Kangaskhan, Granbull, and opposing Scyther. Since Scyther is very status-prone, cleric Pokemon like Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria can heal off any stray Toxic or paralysis thrown at it. Scyther also appreciates a check to Arcanine, such as Tentacruel or Blastoise. Scyther is less effective at wallbreaking after Intimidate, and these teammates allow for safe switch-ins and can remove Spikes for Scyther's team. Lanturn can resist any BoltBeam coverage thrown Scyther's way from Electric-types, Walrein, offensive Omastar, and special attacking Ghost-types. Pokemon that block Rapid Spin, like Haunter and Misdreavus, help keep Spikes on the opposing side of the field and provide valuable offensive utility, such as Haunter's Thief, Will-O-Wisp, and Destiny Bond and Misdreavus's Thunder Wave.</p>"
        },
        "Salac Reversal": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Salac Reversal Scyther is a dangerous late-game sweeper that is nearly impossible to stop without a priority move post-Speed boost. The choice of Hidden Power is mostly up to personal preference; Hidden Power Bug is boosted by Swarm and hits Psychic-types hard, while Hidden Power Flying has better coverage for Poison- and Ghost-types. Substitute is used to bring Scyther's HP down to 1% and capitalize on switches, allowing Scyther to use Swords Dance behind the Substitute. Scyther's HP cannot be divisible by 4 for Substitute sets to activate Salac Berry, so 4 EVs should be put into HP to make four Substitutes and for Reversal to be at maximum power. Endure allows Scyther to reliably get into Salac Berry range even if it took damage prior, lets it take hits from faster Pokemon, and gives it more freedom to set up Swords Dance at least once against most targets, since it is rarely OHKOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Salac Reversal Scyther fits very well onto hyper offense teams, as it can outspeed and sweep every Pokemon without priority, and it can force damage onto bulkier targets. It can generally force the removal of at least one Pokemon for sweeper teammates to capitalize on. This Scyther set appreciates Spikes set early in the match for it to sweep more easily, benefitting from leads such as Qwilfish and Glalie that get as many layers of Spikes as possible then use Explosion to keep up momentum. Scyther also loves support that helps it enter freely, such as Yawn Kangaskhan, to force a switch or give Scyther a way to prey on the slept Pokemon. Explosion users, such as Electrode, Solrock, Haunter, and Muk, fit well as teammates, as they can remove key Pokemon for Scyther to make a full sweep or at least provide valuable chip if Explosion fails to KO, as well as giving free entry for Scyther. Since Arcanine and Gligar stand in the way of Reversal Scyther's sweep, it appreciates offensive teammates that force damage onto them early, such as Arcanine, offensive Kangaskhan, and Water-types like Gorebyss, Golduck, and Feraligatr. Ground-types like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Sandslash can check opposing Electric-types that threaten Scyther while making significant progress of their own.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Scyther is a fast setup sweeper that can clean up late-game with its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ground as well as break holes in the opposition for teammates to capitalize on and clean up.</p> <p>Scyther prefers dual STAB moves on Swords Dance sets, usually using Silver Wind and Aerial Ace. Silver Wind is its primary STAB move, giving it access to dangerous omniboosts, and it is further boosted when Scyther is in Swarm range. Aerial Ace allows for useful coverage against various Flying-, Fighting-, and Ghost-types like Gligar, Haunter, Misdreavus, and Hitmontop. These options free up a slot for Hidden Power Ground for hitting Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-types like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Omastar, and Aggron. Alternatively, Quick Attack gives Scyther a priority move if it can forgo the coverage of Hidden Power Ground, allowing access to a Hidden Power with STAB.</p> <p>The item choice can be team-dependent but is mostly up to preference. Leftovers helps Scyther passively heal any damage it takes and have more longevity, while Lum Berry is used when Scyther doesn't have cleric support and lets it set up in the face of Toxic or paralysis that would otherwise shut down any chance Scyther has at sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Omastar and Qwilfish helps Swords Dance Scyther muscle past bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Walrein. Thief support from Omastar, Tentacruel, Arcanine, Haunter, and Electabuzz further facilitates the sweep by removing Leftovers from defensive Pokemon that rely on passive recovery, meaning the damage they take from Scyther's boosted moves and Spikes will be permanent. Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel, Walrein, and Lanturn synergize well, as they can threaten Omastar, Arcanine, Altaria, and Walrein, which can otherwise stand in the way of Scyther's sweep, and they are good at making progress for Scyther to take advantage of. Fearow and Gligar make for good partners, as they are fast mid-game wallbreakers that can back up Scyther's general lack of priority and make for a brutal one-two punch of Flying offense.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can hurt Metagross and Jirachi, do a little more to Regice, and also screw up the uncommon Scizor and Registeel switch-ins. Jynx can also learn cool support moves, such as Wish, Reflect and Light Screen, but many other Pokemon are more durable and are much more effective in a support role. There's nothing noteworthy in the rest of Jynx's movepool: it learns a few physical moves, but it does not have the Attack stat to use them effectively; this would also require taking EVs out of Special Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metagross and Jirachi resist Ice Beam and Psychic, and have high defensive stats to take a few hits. Sleep Talk Metagross is particularly threatening, while Jirachi can set up with Calm Mind alongside Jynx. Houndoom's Early Bird makes Lovely Kiss hard to use; it also resists Ice Beam, is immune to Psychic, and can decimate Jynx with both STAB Flamethrower and Pursuit. Blissey takes very little from anything Jynx can do, but will just be setup bait unless something else has already been put to sleep. Snorlax has Thick Fat and often runs a Sleep Talk set, which really screws over Jynx. Registeel and Regice take little from Jynx's Ice Beam, but without Psych Up, Seismic Toss, or Earthquake, Regice can't beat Calm Mind Jynx.</p>",

You could use Barrier to try and make Electabuzz survive a little longer / survive a STAB Earthquake and Counter it back for a quick kill. Thief is just an awesome move. Steal Leftovers from the most annoying staller you can find and laugh.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll need at least 244 Speed EVs to hit 307, beating Jolly Kangaskhan. Alternately, you could use 136 Speed EVs with a +Speed nature. Give it -Attack or -Defense, depending on whether you are using a Fighting move. Put the rest in Attack and Special Attack, always focusing more on Special Attack. The only time you're going to want to put some in Defense is for the last set, where you should focus on Defense, HP and Special Attack, with a little bit in its mediocre Special Defense, making it either Modest or Timid. A +Speed nature is almost exclusively to beat out Fearow, a very deadly UU Choice Bander. Otherwise, Electabuzz beats mostly the same things regardless of nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grumpig and Hypno are easily able to switch into it with their beefy Special defense and Muk is quite useful, seeing as it will soak up any of Electabuzz's moves with its HP. You might also try Lanturn and Ampharos, as Electabuzz is unable to really put a big dent into them, due to their resistance to most of Electabuzz's moves, and high Special Defense stats. Meganium and Vileplume could put up a fight, despite being weak to one of its moves.</p>",

Watch out for Thieving from Grumpig, however, as it might be a Trickbanding variant (if it tries to Trick right away, though, you'll just steal the Choice Band, and it will Trick it right back onto itself, so you do a 40 power Super Effective move for free). Substitute is to block status and help with prediction. Not much is hit in UU by Focus Punch / Cross Chop that isn't hit harder by your other moves, which is why it's not on here.</p>"},

If Focus Punch comes just short of killing the foe, Electabuzz will be forced to switch out for fear of Earthquake from Tyranitar, Thunder Wave or Seismic Toss from Blissey, or anything from Snorlax. If running Cross Chop, however, Electabuzz will be able to hit the opponent once as it switches in, and then immediately deal the finishing blow.

Pinsir suffers the most from not having a decent STAB attack, but, with the element of surprise backing, he can be a worthwhile investment. It has the advantage of not being walled by Solrock, and has a likely 2HKO with Rock Slide or Brick Break on Walrein with a Choice Band set, same for Return on Gligar, which are the 3 main physical walls used in UU. The Swords Dancer also has the ability to set up on almost anything in a UU team, and Solrock can't come out to try and abuse your weakness to Rock due to the threat of Hidden Power Bug.</p>",

Double-Edge can be used over Return in case Gligar gets really defensive.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll want an Adamant nature most of the time, but sometimes, Jolly can get you just enough Speed to put you above foes like Kangaskhan and enemy Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fearow can come in on Earthquake or Hidden Power Bug and OHKO with Choice Band Drill Peck. Golem has high defenses and STAB Rock Slide to take Pinsir out. Ninetales, Magmar, and Rapidash resist Hidden Power Bug and have STAB on Flamethrower, but Earthquake or Rock Slide will spell their end.

Intimidate, an excellent ability on any sweeper, gives Tauros more opportunities to switch in and ravage the opponent's teams. Unfortunately, Tauros's pros end here. Skarmory and Forretress, both common Pokemon in ADV, completely wall Tauros and can set up entry hazards while taking little damage from any of its moves. Additionally, Tauros has a shallow physical movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power to get past most of its checks. Don't let these faults deter you from using Tauros though, as it can easily sweep through teams once Skarmory and Forretress are eliminated.</p>",

Iron Tail can be used for Gengar and Tyranitar, while simultaneously giving you a weapon against Aerodactyl, but the 75% accuracy is almost never worth it. Sleep Talk can make Tauros a makeshift sleep absorber. This can be particularly helpful on more offensive teams that will commonly lack a more reliable sleep absorber or cleric. A Substitute set with Leftovers could work, but Tauros is better off with Choice Band. As Tauros's physical movepool is so mediocre, it should just stick with the moves mentioned on the set. Body Slam is useful for paralyzing opponents, but Tauros doesn't really need the paralysis support as it's so fast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned before, Forretress and Skarmory are the most common and best checks to Tauros; they take little damage from Tauros's moves bar Fire Blast and can set up Spikes to give their team the upper hand. Jirachi and Metagross can switch in on a predicted Return and proceed to hit back with Fire Punch and Meteor Mash, respectively. Although uncommon, Regirock and Registeel take little from Return, and can set up with Curse and proceed to do a number to your opponent's team. Dusclops, a staple on many stall teams, takes little damage from any of Tauros's moves bar Hidden Power Ghost, and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>If you lack Skarmory or Forretress, it's important to switch in your Pokemon that resist Normal moves on Return and try to defeat Tauros that way. Although Tauros is somewhat bulky, it can still be revenge killed by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Jolteon, Gengar, and even Alakazam.

Double-Edge serves as an alternative to Return; it hits significantly harder, but causes recoil damage. Earthquake is the secondary move of choice as it allows Tauros to combat the likes of Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi, who all do not fear STAB Return or Double-Edge. Hidden Power Ghost hits Gengar, one of the most common and powerful Pokemon in ADV, for super effective damage.</p> <p>The EV spread is rather simple; maximize Attack to make Tauros hit as hard as possible and maximize Speed to ensure Tauros can outpace as many Pokemon as possible. Choice Band is easily the best option for Tauros as it hits incredibly hard with the aforementioned item.

Magneton is easily Tauros's best partner as it can not only prevent Skarmory and Forretress from switching out, but also OHKO them with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Snorlax and Salamence with Fire Blast and Metagross with Thunder Punch or Hidden Power Fire can surprise the aforementioned Steel-types, who might expect a boosting move or a resisted STAB move.</p> <p>Other good partners are physical attackers that can break through the defenses of Forretress and Skarmory. Choice Band Medicham can 2HKO the aforementioned Steel-types with a little bit of prior damage, which might enable Tauros to sweep later in the game. Choice Band Slaking with Focus Punch also works similarly to Medicham by breaking through Steel-types with relative ease. Additionally, powerful special attackers, such as Zapdos and Jirachi, also make quick work of Forretress and Skarmory with Thunderbolt and Fire Punch, respectively.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Gyarados is a Pokemon with decent bulk that can function as both an early-game pivot with Intimidate and a late-game threat with Dragon Dance. Unlike other physical sweepers such as Tyranitar and Salamence, it has both an immunity to Ground-type attacks and doesn't have much trouble with bulky Water-types. It can also destroy defensive Pokemon one-on-one with Rest.</p> <p>However, it is countered by Zapdos, and its Attack stat can be underwhelming, preventing it from OHKOing bulky Gengar, Metagross, and Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome because it needs different Hidden Power types to hit Aerodactyl and Celebi and Taunt to prevent status and phazers from ruining its sweep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used against Pokemon such as Refresh Swampert, Milotic, Forretress, Claydol, Metagross, and Snorlax to block status, exploit the inaccuracy of moves such as Rock Slide, and scouts Explosion. Hidden Power Ghost lets Gyarados OHKO bulky Gengar and offensive Starmie after one Dragon Dance, but Hidden Power Flying or Hidden Power Rock is generally preferred. Choice Band can be considered, though such a set is generally outclassed by Choice Band Salamence because Salamence has Rock Slide for Zapdos and Aerodactyl, Brick Break for Tyranitar and Blissey, and a better Speed stat to outspeed Suicune, Moltres, Heracross, and Venusaur. Don't be tempted to use a special set to surprise usual Gyarados counters, as it is far too weak and is outclassed by other special attackers such as Starmie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zapdos is the best counter because it resists Hidden Power Flying, is immune to Earthquake, and OHKOes Gyarados with Thunderbolt. It can also use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis against Gyarados teams and Agility to use Gyarados as setup fodder. Although Rest Gyarados tanks Thunderbolt from bulky Gengar and 2HKOes it with +1 Hidden Power Flying, bulky Gengar tanks +1 Hidden Power Flying from standard Gyarados and strikes back with Thunderbolt or Explosion. It can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Gyarados teams. Physical Salamence can outspeed Gyarados and set up with Dragon Dance or use Rock Slide. Aerodactyl and Jolteon are faster than Adamant Gyarados even after a Dragon Dance boost and revenge kill it with their STAB moves. However, these Pokemon don't enjoy taking Thunder Wave from Gyarados.</p> <p>Skarmory beats Gyarados one-on-one with Drill Peck. If Gyarados lacks Taunt or Rest, Toxic and phazing moves, especially from Swampert, will prevent it from sweeping. Porygon2 shrugs off Gyarados's attacks with ease and threatens it with an Electric-type move and status. Starmie and Regice also survive Gyarados's attacks to counter with decently powerful Electric-type moves or Thunder Wave; however, with investment in special bulk, Gyarados tanks Thunderbolt from offensive Starmie and 2HKOes it with +1 Hidden Power Flying. Thanks to Taunt or Rest, it can also shrug off Thunder Wave from defensive Starmie. Pokemon such as Celebi can deal with Hidden Power Rock variants of Gyarados.</p> <p>Weezing can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Gyarados and can batter Gyarados down with Sludge Bomb. If needed, it can even pack an Electric-type move or Explosion to defeat Gyarados. Gyarados can also fall easily to a surprising coverage move, such as Zap Cannon from Forretress, Thunder Punch from Metagross, Hidden Power Electric from Pokemon such as Suicune, Thunderbolt from Pokemon such as Blissey, and Counter from Snorlax. Finally, Gyarados can't come into status moves well unless it can use Rest in a late-game one-on-one situation against Pokemon such as Blissey and bulky Water-types.</p> <p>The number of Pokemon that reliably counter Gyarados may be quite limited, but there are plenty of Pokemon that can prevent Gyarados from sweeping by checking in a pinch. Snorlax, Metagross, and even Claydol can survive anything Gyarados throws at them and use Explosion to trade, while Tyranitar can survive boosted Earthquake to KO Gyarados with Rock Slide.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Standard Gyarados can be sent out against foes that cannot threaten it very much like Swampert and Suicune. In addition, it is a good switch-in to Heracross thanks to Intimidate and a resistance to its STAB moves, but it must be careful, as it doesn't take even -1 Rock Slide well. Furthermore, Gyarados can be switched into Celebi on predicted Recover.</p> <p>Dragon Dance is often used late-game when checks like Zapdos, bulky Gengar, and physical Salamence have been sufficiently weakened. Hidden Power Flying is generally superior to Hidden Power Rock because it not only receives STAB but also hits Pokemon such as Heracross, Celebi, Gengar, Claydol, Flygon, and Breloom. Hidden Power Rock deals heavy damage to Zapdos, which is one of Gyarados's main counters, as well as Aerodactyl, which usually walls Gyarados, though Hidden Power Rock variants must run a Jolly nature so that they outrun Aerodactyl after Dragon Dance. Earthquake is for Tyranitar, Metagross, and Jirachi, but at +1 it still doesn't OHKO them.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Double-Edge gives extra power needed to finish off Pokemon such as Zapdos (if using Hidden Power Flying) and Starmie. Alternatively, Taunt blocks phazing moves from Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune, Toxic from Pokemon such as Milotic and Blissey, and Will-O-Wisp from Moltres. It also prevents offensive Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Salamence and Substitute + Endeavor Swampert, from setting up on Gyarados. Lastly, Thunder Wave cripples switch-ins such as Zapdos, Gengar, Salamence, and Aerodactyl, which can be useful early-game.</p> <p>With 188 Speed EVs, Gyarados outspeeds all unboosted Tyranitar, as well as offensive Starmie after a Dragon Dance. 208 Speed EVs let +1 Gyarados outrun Jolly Dugtrio. When a Jolly nature and Hidden Power Rock are chosen, 172 Speed EVs let Gyarados beat out Jolteon and Aerodactyl after a Dragon Dance, while 232 Speed EVs let Gyarados outpace Modest Moltres. However, Adamant is generally preferred, as the extra power is crucial in giving Gyarados a chance to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton traps Skarmory, which walls Gyarados and even wears Taunt variants down with Drill Peck. It also chips Metagross and defensive Jirachi, making it easier for Gyarados to sweep. Dragon Dance Tyranitar offers a secondary wincon and punishes Zapdos, which annoys Gyarados. In return, Gyarados deals with bulky Water-type Pokemon, Choice-locked Dugtrio, and Heracross. Dragon Dance Salamence has both offensive and defensive synergy with Gyarados: one acts as a wallbreaker, and the other acts as a sweeper, with the idea that many answers to Dragon Dance sweepers are only one-time checks. The double Intimidate combination on a frail hyper offense team also provides additional insurance against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Metagross not only can provide a resistance to Rock-type attacks but also can either soften Zapdos for Gyarados with Rock Slide or exploit Gyarados's chip damage to sweep with Agility and Meteor Mash. Special sponges such as Snorlax deal with special attackers like Zapdos, Starmie, Jolteon, and Porygon2, which Gyarados dislikes. With Earthquake, Snorlax helps to provide the chip damage needed to bring Tyranitar and Metagross into boosted Earthquake's KO range. Pursuit users trap Gengar most of the time, which helps Gyarados, especially if it chooses Hidden Power Rock. Pursuit Tyranitar also chips down Aerodactyl, Choice Band Salamence, and Zapdos, all of which are threats Gyarados wants weakened. Ground-type Pokemon such as Claydol and Swampert act as both Pokemon that resist Rock-type moves and pivots for Electric-type attacks. Swords Dance Celebi can Baton Pass its boosts to Gyarados, alleviating its lack of power.</p> <p>If a Jolly set with Hidden Power Rock is used to lure Zapdos and Jolteon, Suicune is an ideal partner. If Thunder Wave is used for switch-ins such as Gengar, Zapdos, Salamence, and Aerodactyl, slow wallbreakers such as Heracross, Marowak, Machamp, and Rhydon can be considered.</p>"

        "Rest": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rest allows Gyarados to shrug off damage and status from Pokemon such as Blissey without Thunderbolt, Milotic, Refresh Claydol, defensive Jirachi, defensive Starmie without Thunderbolt, and defensive Swampert, which are commonly seen on defensive teams. However, after it uses Rest, it can lose momentum. A big negative is that setup sweepers can capitalize on Gyarados's sleep turns, so Rest is best used in the endgame so that Gyarados can beat non-Thunderbolt Blissey and Toxic-wielding bulky Water-types one-on-one.</p> <p>The investment in special bulk lets Gyarados survive Thunderbolt from Pokemon such as offensive Starmie and bulky Gengar. It also tanks other special attacks such as Salamence's Dragon Claw well. However, it is also possible to use a bulkier spread. For example, 248 HP / 56 Def / 112 SpD / 92 Spe lets Gyarados soak up not only Rock Slide from Adamant Tyranitar and +1 Salamence but also Thunderbolt from offensive Starmie in sand while still letting it outrun Pokemon such as offensive Calm Mind Jirachi and Jolly Salamence after a boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton is nearly mandatory, as this set does nothing with Skarmory around. Steel-types such as Metagross and the rare Steelix take Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Aerodactyl. Gyarados and Steelix form an interesting synergistic combination in checking all common special threats bar Starmie. In return, Gyarados takes Ground- and Fire-type attacks from threats such as Swampert, Moltres, Claydol, and Flygon. Salamence provides a Gyarados team with another Intimidate Pokemon, providing more safety against physical attacks. Pursuit Tyranitar traps Gengar most of the time and chips down Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Choice Band Salamence, of which Gyarados takes advantage. Pokemon such as Snorlax, Celebi, and Blissey deal with special attackers such as Zapdos and Jolteon, which Gyarados dislikes. As Rest Gyarados is prone to being exploited by Tyranitar or taken out by Metagross's Explosion while it is asleep, Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax can be a great partner that baits and removes these powerful physical threats.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>With a huge 130 base HP stat, decent stats all around, an excellent offensive movepool coverage-wise, and a great ability in Water Absorb, Lapras looks awesome in theory. However, it has major issues in practice. First of all, Lapras is outclassed by other OU Water-types, notably Vaporeon (who also has Water Absorb), Milotic, and Swampert, in the role of bulky Water. This is because many of the Pokemon that bulky Waters typically check, such as Tyranitar and Metagross, beat Lapras one-on-one due to its irksome secondary Ice typing, which gives it many qualities undesirable in a bulky Water, most notably a weakness to Rock and a neutrality to Steel. In addition, Lapras is outclassed as a Dragon Dance sweeper by other Pokemon with higher offensive stats, physical STAB, and a better physical movepool, such as Salamence. Finally, Lapras is outclassed as an all-purpose special wall by the likes of Regice due to the fact that Lapras has two special weaknesses to common attacking types, namely Electric and Grass, and is also vulnerable to all forms of passive damage and status.</p> <p>In general, Lapras works best against teams that rely on defensive type synergy and resistances, as opposed to those that rely on dedicated special walls to counter special attackers. Lapras has one major niche in OU: Toxic enables it stall out bulky Waters such as Milotic, and Roar enables it to phaze boosting Waters such as Suicune, and rack up Spikes damage as well. However, note that if it lacks Roar, Lapras is a poor answer to Suicune, as Suicune will then be able to Pressure stall it with ease.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lapras has an interesting boosting move in Dragon Dance and could potentially occupy a niche as a bulky boosting sweeper with Dragon Dance and 101 HP Substitutes, as well as either the unresisted combination of Hidden Power Ground and Ice Beam, or Return and Surf. Surf is a decent STAB move that provides some coverage; not only is it Lapras's best option against Metagross, it might allow Lapras to take Tyranitar by surprise and hit it for good damage. Surf can also nail Houndoom, but note that Surf forces Lapras to forgo one half of the BoltBeam combination--usually Thunderbolt. There's always Hydro Pump as well, but this is inferior to Surf on a tank such as Lapras due to its lower accuracy and PP.</p> <p>Sing is a good option for the Utility set as it lets Lapras put an unsuspecting switch-in to sleep, but its accuracy is shaky, and it leaves Lapras vulnerable to status and unable to wear down its counters. Psychic can catch Heracross off-guard, but is generally not worth it as it provides no notable coverage outside of Heracross. Perish Song is an interesting option for an alternative phazing move that can deal with threats such as the feared last-Pokemon Calm Mind Suicune; it can also work decently in conjunction with Chaosbreon. Finally, Lapras can function as a decent Curse user, but it is weak to the most common special type in the game, and is easily OHKOed or 2HKOed by all STAB Thunderbolts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Special walls in general, such as Blissey and Snorlax, shrug off anything that Lapras can throw at them; Curse Snorlax can even set up on Lapras that lack phazing utility, while Blissey can heal its teammates of status that Lapras has spread. Specially defensive and Light Screen Forretress variants can use Lapras as Spikes fodder if Lapras is not carrying Surf or Hydro Pump. Regice laughs at anything Lapras throws at it and can hit it hard with Thunderbolt. Dusclops completely walls Lapras and can status it with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, and its Pressure ability lets it beat even RestTalk Lapras.</p> <p>Heracross has the Special Defense to take hits from Lapras, and can hit it with a super effective Fighting move. In addition to being immune to Toxic, Metagross can also take all of Lapras's hits, then swiftly 2HKO it with Meteor Mash. Tyranitar needs to watch out for Surf and Toxic, but once it's safely in, it can dispatch of Lapras with a powerful Rock Slide or set up with Substitute or Dragon Dance on a predicted switch; uninvested Tyranitar outspeeds Lapras by one point. Houndoom is a good answer to Lapras as it is not even 3HKOed by Thunderbolt and can deal a good 45% with Fire Blast. However, as with Tyranitar, it needs to be cautious of Surf and Toxic. Specially defensive Zapdos is a decent answer to Lapras despite being hit super effectively by Ice Beam; Ice Beam is a 3HKO while Zapdos's Thunderbolt 2HKOes Lapras. SubCM Jirachi makes an excellent Lapras counter as it can boost up to make its Substitutes unbreakable, is immune to Toxic, and immediately threatens Lapras with Thunder or Thunderbolt. SubCM Raikou is in a similar boat to Jirachi, but needs to watch out for Toxic on the switch. Lanturn and Magneton both resist the BoltBeam combination and can hit Lapras for super effective damage with their STAB Electric moves. Thick Fat Hariyama resists Ice moves and can hit Lapras hard with Cross Chop.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Switch this into a bulky Water and predict accordingly; either use Roar to rack up hazard damage, or hit the incoming Electric-type with Ice Beam. Otherwise, the idea of this set is to function as a general tank and status absorber. Rest and Sleep Talk enable Lapras to stay alive for long periods of time, recover its health back, and not be dead weight when asleep.</p> <p>Thunderbolt gives Lapras a good answer to Water-types such as Vaporeon, while Roar makes it a reliable phazer that capitalizes on Spikes support. Note that Roar only really works alongside Spikes support; without it, Lapras will be ironically stalled to a rather boring death by the status-inflicting Water-types it usually likes to switch into. Forgoing Thunderbolt for Roar, however, leaves Lapras with major issues with special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax. The latter in particular can fearlessly set up multiple Curse boosts on it and proceed to do huge damage to your team.</p> <p>Maximize Lapras's HP to optimize its tanking ability. The given spread provides roughly equal defenses so that Lapras can take both physical and special hits decently enough. The Special Attack investment enables Lapras to deal out decent damage to the Water-types it can absorb status from, such as Toxic Milotic.</p> <p>This set works best alongside Spikes support, but unfortunately, none of the three most common OU Spikes users synergize particularly well with Lapras: Skarmory shares a crippling Electric weakness with Lapras, while Cloyster shares the exact same typing as Lapras. Your best bet for Spikes support is Light Screen or specially defensive variants of Forretress, which can defend itself to some extent against neutral special hits, such as Gengar's Thunderbolt. Despite the Electric weakness, however, Skarmory is a decent Spikes user because it can switch into and set up on Blissey and Snorlax, while Curselax forces Forretress to Explode at some stage. Furthermore, Forretress and Skarmory make decent switch-ins to Metagross, and the latter also counters Heracross; both are foes that Lapras fears. Swampert makes for an excellent partner to Lapras thanks to its ability to check Tyranitar and Metagross; it is also immune to the Electric-type attacks that Lapras hates. However, beware as Swampert has issues with Electric-types that utilize Hidden Power Grass, which most do nowadays.</p>"

          "description": "<p>This Lapras, while bereft of recovery aside from Water Absorb, can provide very effective team support. The idea behind this set is to switch into Water-types and heal off any prior damage by absorbing Surf, then proceed to deal out damage, phaze, spread status, or provide cleric support. Toxic is preferred over Heal Bell as catching the likes of Raikou on the switch disables it from sweeping, but Heal Bell is also a good option because Lapras is a relatively durable cleric. On the flip side though, Toxic leaves Lapras vulnerable to status itself, especially poison, while Heal Bell often renders it unable to inflict decent residual damage. Roar is an important aspect of the set as it enables Lapras to capitalize on forced switches, rack up Spikes damage, and also phaze opponents that try to set up on it. It is possible to forgo Roar to accommodate both Toxic and Heal Bell, but this is inadvisable.</p> <p>The EV spread is standard; max HP optimizes its ability to take hits in general. The Defense EVs are invested to roughly equal out both of Lapras's defenses. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Attack so that Lapras packs a little more offensive punch with its Ice Beams and Thunderbolts.</p> <p>If Lapras chooses not to use Heal Bell, physically defensive Heal Bell Celebi makes a good partner as it resists the Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks that plague Lapras's existence, while also removing Lapras's vulnerability to status. Note that Heracross, OU's premier Fighting-type, beats them both unless Celebi has substantial Speed investment, so it's advisable to also pack a Heracross counter, such as Skarmory. Swampert makes a decent partner thanks to its resistances to Rock and Steel, as well as its immunity to Electric; it can also check threats to Lapras, such as Tyranitar and Metagross. Both share a weakness to Grass though, so be sure to pack a teammate that resists Grass, such as Skarmory or Salamence, which are both good Heracross checks as well. Claydol makes an excellent partner to Lapras thanks to its ability to check Tyranitar, as well as its key resistances to Rock and Fighting, and its immunity to Electric. In addition to spinning away the Spikes that wear Lapras down, Claydol can also bait Water moves from the likes of Milotic to heal Lapras. Yet again, though, Heracross beats both Claydol and Lapras, so Skarmory or another of the aforementioned Heracross counters is recommended.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charm can frustrate physical sweepers with Curse and Dragon Dance. Rest is not as support-oriented as Wish is, but Vaporeon is crippled by status otherwise, so it's a viable option. Vaporeon can also Baton Pass Curse boosts. Hidden Power Electric is the only way Vaporeon can beat Taunt Gyarados, and it also helps against other Water-types as Vaporeon does have a respectable Special Attack stat to work with. A Modest nature is an option on sets with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Electric if you feel Vaporeon needs the extra power. Wish + Baton Pass sets can also run a Relaxed nature with a Speed IV of 0 so that Vaporeon can take a hit and allow a frail sweeper to switch in safely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gyarados can Taunt Vaporeon and set up Dragon Dance with little risk to itself, unless Vaporeon has Hidden Power Electric. Quagsire is immune to Surf thanks to Water Absorb and can set up Curse against sets that lack Haze or Roar. As Tentacruel has high Special Defense and resists both Surf and Ice Beam, it can set up Swords Dance easily. Snorlax can set up Curse boosts on Vaporeon with ease or just wall its hits and prevent it from successfully passing a Substitute. Celebi can set up Calm Mind in Vaporeon's face and Baton Pass to a recipient of its own, or slam it with boosted special attacks. Suicune too can Calm Mind up and Roar out Vaporeon, but unless Spikes are down, Vaporeon can just come right back in and wall mono-attacking Suicune.</p> <p>Lanturn resists Surf and Ice Beam and has STAB Thunderbolt to smack Vaporeon with. Raikou, Jolteon, and Zapdos can easily 2HKO it too; Zapdos has to watch out for Ice Beam if it doesn't invest heavily in Special Defense, however. Porygon2 has the stats to take Ice Beams easily, can Trace Water Absorb to make Surf less than useless, and can nail Vaporeon with Thunderbolt. Trace Gardevoir functions similarly, except it has Wish over Recover, and can set up Calm Mind. Venusaur and Meganium can take on sets without Ice Beam if they have a Grass-type move to smack Vaporeon with.

Vaporeon's Substitute has more than 100 HP, so Seismic Toss will not break it. This Vaporeon combines nicely with heavy hitters, as they will have more turns to hurt their counters or set up and sweep; examples are Gengar, Heracross, and Rhydon.</p>"},

Wish + Protect forms a makeshift Recover for Vaporeon, and allows it to heal its teammates too. Protect further eases prediction against Choice users and, in conjunction with Toxic, helps Vaporeon stall out threats that can't 2HKO it.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Vaporeon survive two hits from Choice Band Salamence, which allows it to switch in with ease and OHKO back with Ice Beam.</p>"},
        "Phazer": {"description": "<p>Haze provides more security against Suicune, as Suicune is faster and can Roar Vaporeon away before the latter can do the same to it; Haze also works against Soundproof Pokemon. However, with Roar, Vaporeon can blow away Substitutes and inflict Spikes damage on opponents. Several moves are viable in the last moveslot: Ice Beam destroys Dragon-types such as Salamence, Protect eases prediction and pairs well with Wish, while Toxic cripples walls that lack Rest or Natural Cure.</p>"},
        "Acid Armor + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This set works best on a dedicated Baton Pass team. Acid Armor allows Vaporeon's teammates to set up on powerful physical attackers such as Salamence and Snorlax. With Acid Armor, Vaporeon also becomes the next best counter to Choice Band users outside of Scizor and Mawile. Substitute is preferred in the fourth moveslot for its general utility, especially if you have another Wish user such as Celebi for a teammate; Vaporeon's ability to pass Substitutes that stand up to Seismic Toss is another major plus. However, if you don't have a team slot to spare for a Wish user, then Vaporeon itself can run Wish over Substitute.</p>"}

      "overview": "<p>With base 110 Special Attack and base 130 Speed, Jolteon can both force numerous switches to rack up damage from Spikes early-game and act as a cleaner late-game. Thanks to Volt Absorb and decent Special Defense, it can also act as a pivot against numerous special attackers including Gengar, Zapdos, and to a lesser extent Starmie, though it can be crippled by all forms of status.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used, as it also cripples most Pokemon hit by either Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass. However, Toxic damage racks up too slowly for the fast-paced teams on which Jolteon usually fits to take advantage of. Stat-boosting Berries such as Petaya, Salac, and Liechi Berry can come in handy when passing Substitute to make another member of the team more dangerous. In particular, Petaya Berry has the added benefit of being useful to Jolteon itself. However, in order to get into the activation range of these Berries, Jolteon must be worn down much more quickly, which detracts from its pivoting ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax easily shrug off Jolteon's attacks. Celebi is another good counter to Jolteon because it doesn't even fear Hidden Power Ice. Bulky physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Metagross can check Jolteon with the threat of Earthquake. Ground-type Pokemon such as Flygon, Swampert, and Claydol can handle Jolteon, but Flygon cannot wall Hidden Power Ice variants and Swampert cannot take on Hidden Power Grass variants. Though they are uncommon, Camerupt and Steelix are probably the best counters to Jolteon, as they can take any attack Jolteon can throw at them. Porygon2 is an interesting counter because it can acquire Volt Absorb with Trace. Roar Jolteon itself can check an opposing Jolteon, but it must be wary of Thunder Wave.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Jolteon's main STAB move, dealing significant damage to any foe that doesn't resist it except special walls. Hidden Power Ice KOes Pokemon such as Salamence and Flygon. Hidden Power Grass can be used to threaten Swampert instead. Baton Pass allows Jolteon to escape from Dugtrio, rack up damage from Spikes, and keep up the momentum. Roar racks up plenty of residual damage on foes in combination with Spikes. Thunder Wave is useful due to Jolteon's ability to outspeed most offensive threats and safely cripple them. Combined with Baton Pass, Substitute is great to support dangerous Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Metagross because Jolteon attracts special walls like Blissey. It also blocks status moves such as Thunder Wave from Zapdos. Wish is an option that allows Jolteon to heal its teammates. Jolteon's lack of bulk may make this move seem undesirable, but the fact that it draws in a large number of passive Pokemon can make it an effective Wish passer.</p> <p>76 HP EVs allow Jolteon to survive Hydro Pump from offensive Starmie after sand and three layers of Spikes, as well as Rock Slide from Aerodactyl. Maximum Speed investment lets Jolteon outspeed the majority of the metagame and Speed tie with Aerodactyl and opposing Jolteon if necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jolteon fits comfortably on offensive teams with Spikes, making Spikes users such as Skarmory and Cloyster great partners. Jolteon also pairs well with physical attackers such as Tyranitar and Metagross, as its Baton Pass can bring them in against special walls. Lastly, Pokemon that can attract Electric-type attacks such as Starmie pair nicely, allowing Jolteon to come in and regain health.</p>"

    "ru": {"sets": {"Mixed Offensive": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Flareon's one of NU's best wallbreakers thanks to its combination of raw strength, good versatility, and useful defensive traits. It can run a mixed set with a very potent Double-Edge to lure in and chunk bulky Water-types and Quick Attack to pick off weakened foes like Pikachu and Huntail. Alternatively, it can go specially offensive to amp up its Fire Blast's damage and give it better odds against Sudowoodo, Relicanth, and Whiscash with Hidden Power Grass or Pelipper with Hidden Power Electric. Flareon's coverage is superb regardless of which set it uses, and teams usually must rely on smart pivoting around its attacks to prevent it from wreaking havoc. Flareon's also hard to revenge kill because most faster attackers can't reliably KO it without significant chip damage. Its defensive prowess also lets it check foes such as Haunter, Bellossom, and Torkoal. The most noticeable downside to Flareon is its reliance on Double-Edge to significantly damage Wailord and Dewgong, and depending on which Hidden Power it uses, varying foes like Pelipper, Whiscash, and Sudowoodo can pose problems. Flareon is also weak to common Water- and Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Wailord, Glalie, and Metang, which can make fitting it onto teams difficult.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Specially defensive EV spreads with Wish and Baton Pass make Flareon much more secure against foes such as Haunter, Bellossom, and Plusle while keeping it from being too easily trapped by Diglett, although they falter against Water-types such as Wailord and Huntail. Alternatively, physically defensive spreads are workable due to Flareon's fantastic natural special bulk, make it harder for Haunter to pick it off with Explosion, help against Flying-types such as Murkrow and Pidgeot, and ensure Diglett's Earthquake never OHKOes Flareon. A Lum or Chesto Berry makes the Bellossom and Venomoth matchups trivial by cleansing sleep, and the latter has more general use if Flareon opts for Rest. Salac Berry in conjunction with Endure and Flail makes Flareon a potent late-game sweeper if the opponent lacks a priority move user, with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass ensuring its coverage remains solid. Curse + Baton Pass with White Herb supports physical powerhouses like Hitmonchan and gives Flareon a way to boost its own Attack, but Curse's Speed drop means you really only have one chance to make this strategy work. Hidden Power Water or Rock offers niche coverage for opposing Fire-types in Torkoal and Flareon, with the latter also hitting Pelipper, although they're generally outclassed. Choice Band lets Flareon net higher KO thresholds than Silk Scarf against foes like Wailord, Chimecho, and Dewgong when using Double-Edge, but this set makes Flareon more trappable and easier to take advantage of.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Wailord, Pelipper, and Whiscash all easily tank Flareon's Double-Edge, although the latter two must first scout which Hidden Power type it has. Offensive Water-types like Huntail, Octillery, and Crawdaunt take significantly more damage from Flareon's attacks, but they threaten to KO it back. Seadra and Dewgong get special mentions here for being faster than Flareon and KOing it with Hydro Pump and Surf, though the latter needs prior chip damage to do so.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Sudowoodo and Relicanth resist Flareon's strongest attacks, and the latter can EV to avoid being OHKOed by Hidden Power Grass. Pupitar can use non-Hidden Power Grass Flareon as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Torkoal and Sableye</strong>: Torkoal takes a pittance from any attack of Flareon's. If Flareon has Substitute + Toxic, though, it's wholly walled unless running a niche attack like Rock Slide. Meanwhile, Sableye can shut down mixed Flareon because it can stall Flareon out of Fire Blast PP, but it falls flat against special attacking sets.</p>",

        "Mixed Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Silk Scarf Flareon has few reliable answers because of how absurdly strong its Double-Edge is; even Water-types like Wailord and Pelipper are 2HKOed unless they run significant bulk investment. Fire Blast targets Haunter, which otherwise walls this set, as well as Metang and Mawile. On the other hand, Overheat can KO Metang with much less chip damage needed. Hidden Power Grass hits Rock-types such as Sudowoodo and Relicanth while offering more damage against Whiscash than Double-Edge. Alternatively, Hidden Power Electric is Flareon's best damaging move for defensive Pelipper. 228 Attack EVs with a Lonely nature guarantee Flareon's Quick Attack KOes bulkless Diglett after Spikes and ensure Double-Edge 2HKOes offensive Wailord.</p> <p>Alternatively, Flareon can replace Double-Edge with Return or Silk Scarf with Leftovers for more longevity. Leftovers sets may invest more EVs into Special Attack to improve the Sableye matchup at the cost of damage against Wailord and Dewgong.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flareon is fantastic at luring in Water-types and severely weakening them with Double-Edge, making Huntail, Agility Pelipper and Metang, and Pupitar good teammates. Torkoal is also a common switch-in to Flareon, so damaging it supports late-game sweepers like Bellossom, Reversal Raticate, and Agility Metang. To supplement Flareon's wallbreaking prowess, Spikes from Glalie, Roselia, or Cacturne is a must; it synergizes well with Flareon's tendency to force switches and weakens grounded checks like Wailord, Torkoal, and Sableye. Other offensive teammates like Hitmonchan and Haunter are valuable too to weaken shared checks like Pelipper and Sableye, respectively.</p>"

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass give Flareon great coverage across the tier; few Pokemon consistently switch into this combination, and those that do struggle to keep up with Flareon's damage if Spikes are up. Instead of Hidden Power Grass, Flareon can run Hidden Power Electric for a better Pelipper matchup, although this compromises its overall coverage. Substitute lets Flareon take advantage of foes like Torkoal, Roselia, and Mawile that can't threaten it with their attacks, and it can use Substitute alongside Baton Pass to guarantee safe entry for its teammates. Alternatively, Toxic helps Flareon beat Fire- and Water-types like Torkoal, opposing Flareon, and Pelipper, whereas Wish helps Flareon check Pokemon such as Haunter and Bellossom throughout the game while supporting teammates like Metang and Chimecho that are prone to being worn down. Flareon can even forgo Hidden Power entirely to run Toxic alongside some combination of Substitute, Baton Pass, Wish, and Protect depending on your team's needs. Keep in mind that Protect should almost always be run alongside Wish or Toxic.</p> <p>A moveset of Flamethrower / Hidden Power Grass / Overheat / Protect is also possible. Overheat does absurd damage to nonresistant targets like Hitmonchan and Vigoroth, and Protect gives Flareon extra Leftovers recovery while blocking Haunter's and Torkoal's Explosion.</p> <p>8 HP and 84 Defense EVs prevent Adamant Glalie's Earthquake from OHKOing Flareon, though Soft Sand variants make this a damage roll. 224 Speed EVs let Flareon outspeed Jolly Pupitar. A Petaya or Salac Berry can be considered instead of Leftovers; Substitute makes it easier to activate, and Baton Pass lets Flareon supply a teammate with the boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set takes a bit more of a supportive approach, taking advantage of Flareon forcing switches to safely set Substitute and pass it to a teammate. Pikachu benefits from Flareon drawing in Water-types for it to KO, whereas Diglett enjoys being safely brought in against Fire-types to trap them. On the other hand, if Flareon has Toxic instead of Baton Pass, it can cripple Water- and Fire-types like Dewgong, Torkoal, and opposing Flareon. This helps Pokemon like Huntail and Bellossom sweep late-game. Naturally, Spikes are great in ADV NU, and Glalie is a fantastic supplier of them that also can take on bulky Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong.</p>"

Thunderbolt deals significant damage to Corsola and Clamperl, which otherwise switch in on Return and threaten to respectively wall and break through Porygon, and it's stronger against other Water-types like Wartortle, Horsea, and Staryu. Return is a stronger alternative to 2HKO Ponyta and Quilava, notably OHKOing Abra, and it doesn't leave Porygon reliant on Toxic to beat Chinchou. Ice Beam is strong against Gloom and Tropius and keeps Porygon threatening against physical attackers like Cubone and Rhyhorn. Toxic wears down offensive foes like Seaking, Ponyta, and Quilava while Porygon recovers, puts walls like opposing Porygon and Lileep on a timer, and forces Pokemon with ways to mitigate status like Corsola and Noctowl to switch out in Corsola's case or use Refresh and Rest respectively. Thunder Wave is an alternative to Toxic to neutralize fast attackers like Ponyta and Quilava, but it leaves Porygon more passive and unable to wear down opposing walls and Chinchou. Trace has interesting utility perks for Porygon, potentially allowing it to use Corsola's and Staryu's Natural Cure to heal off status and become immune to Flash Fire Ponyta's STAB moves.</p> <p>Porygon's sole Fighting weakness means special attackers like Ponyta, Quilava, and Abra struggle to break through it without support, so it's a great fit for bulky offense and balance teams. Physically defensive Pokemon like Corsola, Gloom, and Koffing are great partners for Porygon given their complementary bulk, making defensive cores that are tough to break, and all of them can absorb Toxic for Porygon and handle offensive Poison-types like Beedrill and Ariados. Tropius is another physically defensive Pokemon that particularly appreciates Porygon handling Ponyta and Quilava, and in return, it can handle Aipom and Meditite for Porygon. Mightyena helps neutralize physical attackers for Porygon with Intimidate and provides cleric support in case Porygon is afflicted by status. Setup sweepers like Beedrill, Anorith, and Abra benefit from Porygon wearing down foes with Toxic so that they can more comfortably sweep. Fast wallbreakers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Quilava benefit from Porygon handling faster special attackers like Abra, Ponyta, and Elekid for them. Porygon struggles to deal with Magnemite, so teammates like specially defensive Gloom, Ponyta, and Flaaffy should handle it for Porygon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Omastar is widely regarded as one of the best Pokemon in UU due to its excellent defensive and offensive qualities. Omastar's access to Spikes is incredibly important for virtually every playstyle, and it finds itself to be the easiest Spikes setter to fit on teams due to its great Defense and decent defensive typing in Water / Rock, which gives it useful resistances to Flying- and especially Normal-type moves; these traits also make it one of the best leads in the metagame and a solid check to powerful Pokemon like Scyther, Fearow, and Kangaskhan. Additionally, Omastar's sky-high Special Attack prevents it from being completely passive when running defensive sets, threatening most of the Pokemon it checks with a strong, STAB-boosted Surf, and allows it to become an extremely deadly rain sweeper when paired with Swift Swim that can completely decimate teams once its checks have been taken down. However, while Water / Rock does provide some handy resistances, it also gives Omastar very common weaknesses to Grass-, Electric-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves, making it more difficult for it to consistently check Pokemon like Choice Band Granbull and Kangaskhan and lessening its effectiveness as a check to Fire-types like Ninetales, since they often run Grass-type coverage. Omastar also suffers from poor special bulk, meaning strong neutral or super effective special attacks will often severely cripple or outright KO it. Omastar's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to status don't help it either, since Leftovers can instantly be negated by poison or burn and offensive sets detest being paralyzed due to their reliance on outspeeding foes. Omastar is also extremely slow without Swift Swim, so it often must take a hit before it can do anything.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Electric may 3HKO Tentacruel depending on the set Omastar is running and lets it deter Tentacruel without having to worry about Hydro Pump's unreliable accuracy. However, using Hidden Power Electric over Hidden Power Grass leaves Omastar vulnerable to Lanturn and Quagsire. RestTalk improves Omastar's longevity and also prevents it from being worn down by status, but it makes Omastar more passive and leaves it setup fodder for Pokemon like Slowking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are able to remove Spikes from their side of the field and deal with Omastar in their own ways. Tentacruel is a fantastic counter to Omastar in general, since it has great special bulk, resists both Water-type STAB move options and Ice Beam, is neutral to Hidden Power Grass, is immune to Toxic, and can 2HKO Omastar with Hydro Pump or OHKO it with Giga Drain. While Hitmontop is the least effective of the Rapid Spin users and does not resist Omastar's attacks, it can inflict poison to Omastar with Toxic and wear it down with Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Walrein, Lanturn, and Slowking are 3HKOed at best by Hidden Power Grass and are able to take down Omastar with their STAB moves or through other methods. Walrein can 3HKO it with Surf or inflict it with Toxic. Lanturn can paralyze Omastar with Thunder Wave and has a STAB in Thunderbolt to OHKO Omastar. Slowking can easily tank a Hidden Power Grass before a Calm Mind boost, use Omastar as setup fodder, and OHKO it at +2. If Omastar does not have Hidden Power Grass, Quagsire, although fairly uncommon, can completely wall it and threaten to 3HKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Due to Omastar's 4x weakness to Grass, Grass-types such as Vileplume and Meganium pose a massive threat to it; the former also threatens to immobilize Omastar with Sleep Powder. However, these Pokemon are weak to Ice Beam, so they aren't always reliable answers.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Electabuzz, Manectric, and Electrode are all very fast and threaten to OHKO Omastar with their super effective STAB moves, which make them huge problems. However, these Pokemon are all frail and would never want to take a STAB Hydro Pump from Rain Dance Omastar.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Poison and burn will instantly negate Leftovers recovery and quickly wear down Omastar due to its lack of reliable recovery. Rain Dance Omastar strongly detests being paralyzed, since that means that even under rain it will fail to outspeed many threats, most notably Electric-types like Electabuzz.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: While special walls such as Hypno and Kangaskhan still take a large chunk of damage from a rain- and STAB-boosted Hydro Pump, they are still able to stall out Rain Dance turns and Hydro Pump PP with Wish and Protect. Hypno and Kangaskhan don't fear anything from offensive and defensive Spikes sets apart from Thief and Toxic, and they can inflict Omastar with Toxic of their own to take it down. However, they do not do much to prevent Spikes from being set up.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes is an incredibly powerful support tool, since it wears down grounded foes every time they switch in, limiting their opportunities while also making it easier for Omastar's teammates to take down bulkier threats. STAB Surf lets Omastar take down Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Ninetales, Gligar, and Lunatone. Toxic cripples and stacks offensive pressure on most Pokemon that try to switch into Omastar, which gives it more opportunities to set Spikes. Protect helps Omastar rack up Toxic damage, gives it a turn of free Leftovers recovery, and allows it to scout for super effective attacks. Hidden Power Grass is an option to threaten an OHKO on opposing Omastar while also hitting other Water-types like Blastoise, Lanturn, and Quagsire. Another option is Ice Beam to take down Scyther and Altaria, which could become dangerous if not taken care of, and prevent Grass-types like Vileplume from freely switching in.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature let Omastar take multiple Earthquakes from Kangaskhan lacking Choice Band and use it as setup fodder for Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, it has to worry about being worn down by Spikes and status, especially poison. Thus, Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are useful teammates. In particular, Tentacruel's resistance to Water, neutrality to Grass-type moves, and immunity to Toxic are very helpful. Moreover, clerics such as Granbull and Vileplume make for great allies. Specifically, Granbull has Intimidate to weaken physical attackers and Thunder Wave to slow down fast Pokemon, and Vileplume has useful resistances to Water, Grass, Electric, and Fighting as well as Sleep Powder to immobilize critical threats. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Banette can block Rapid Spin to keep Omastar's Spikes from being removed, making them useful partners. Grass- and Electric-types like Vileplume and Electabuzz are very dangerous to Omastar, so Pokemon that can check them such as Muk, Cradily, and Camerupt are good choices for their defensive synergy. Wish passers such as Hypno and Kangaskhan are very helpful to increase Omastar's longevity, due to its aforementioned lack of reliable recovery. They can also make use of Protect and Toxic to rapidly wear down foes in combination with Omastar's Spikes. Hypno is an especially synergistic teammate due to its resistance to Fighting-type moves and good special bulk. Lastly, strong attackers such as Scyther and Kangaskhan greatly appreciate Spikes support, since it wears down several common checks and counters and makes bulkier threats much easier to take down.</p>"

Surf is the STAB move of choice due to its higher accuracy and PP over Hydro Pump. Ice Beam takes down Pokemon like Scyther and Altaria as well as Grass-types such as Vileplume, Meganium, and Shiftry. Thief is Omastar's only way of doing anything significant to one of its strongest counters, Tentacruel, taking away its Leftovers and leaving it much more prone to being worn down by Spikes and chip damage.

Since this set should primarily be used on offensive teams, Pokemon that appreciate Omastar's ability to easily set up Spikes early-game such as Electabuzz, Nidoking, and Scyther are excellent partners, as it turns many 3HKOs into 2HKOs, notably giving Nidoking a chance to win against Walrein after two layers of Spikes. Omastar's team needs Spikes to stay up as long as possible, so Rapid Spin users such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, and especially Tentacruel are very problematic. Electric-types such as Electabuzz and Manectric can threaten Blastoise and Tentacruel for Omastar with their super effective STAB moves; Kangaskhan also makes a very good answer to Tentacruel, since it usually runs Earthquake. Meanwhile, Psychic-types such as Hypno and Lunatone can check Hitmontop, as they can tank Brick Break and Hidden Power Ghost and put it down with Psychic. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Banette are also useful partners, but due to their mediocre-at-best bulk, they have to watch out for STAB Hydro Pump from Tentacruel and Hidden Power Ghost from Hitmontop.</p>"

Hydro Pump is preferred over Surf on this set due to its significantly higher power, allowing Omastar to grab many KOs more easily at the cost of lower PP and unreliable accuracy. Ice Beam threatens to KO Flying-types like Fearow, Altaria, and Scyther and Grass-types like Vileplume and Meganium. Hidden Power Grass makes Omastar a more consistent sweeper, preventing it from being defenseless against Quagsire and giving it a better matchup against other Water-types like Blastoise. Although using Spikes over Hidden Power Grass can make Omastar a less effective sweeper, it is still an excellent tool to ease sweeping for Omastar's team and can lull the opponent into a false sense of security about its moveset.</p> <p>Mystic Water raises the power of Hydro Pump and allows Omastar to OHKO Pokemon like Hypno and Cradily under rain if three layers of Spikes have been set up. Instead of opting for the power of Mystic Water, Omastar can use Leftovers to increase its longevity.

Omastar can run as low as 96 Speed EVs to invest into defenses, which would let Omastar survive a Hidden Power Grass from Walrein and still allows it to outspeed Scyther and most Electric-types under rain, although this leaves Omastar more vulnerable outside of rain, since Pokemon like Lunatone will be able to outspeed it and hit it with Psychic or Hypnosis, and also means that it will be unable to outrun Electrode under rain, which can threaten to OHKO it with STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite Omastar's high damage output under rain, it is walled by bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Walrein, and Lanturn, so Electric-types like Electabuzz and Manectric and Grass-types like Vileplume make for good teammates. Vileplume is notable in that it has access to Aromatherapy, which helps offset Omastar's vulnerability to status, particularly Thunder Wave. Baton Passing Calm Mind boosts is very helpful for Omastar, making its already powerful attacks even stronger and helping it tank special attacks; therefore, Hypno and Lunatone can be valuable partners. Hypno notably has good special bulk, resists Fighting-type moves, and has access to Wish to alleviate Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, although Wish and Baton Pass cannot be used together. Choice Band Nidoking and other Ground-types with Choice Band also make for good teammates, since the bulky Water-types that can stop Omastar from sweeping will be significantly weakened if they are forced to take a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. These Ground-types can also serve as pivots for Electric-type attacks aimed at Omastar.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Omastar is one of the premier rain sweepers in ADV Ubers, utilizing Swift Swim to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame in rain barring very fast Pokemon such as Ninjask and Deoxys-S, as well as Rayquaza with its unique Air Lock ability. Omastar exerts strong offensive pressure with its high Special Attack stat and punishes switches by laying down Spikes to wear down the opponent's team. Its Rock typing and high Defense also protects it from the premier revenge killer in the metagame, Deoxys-A, instead revenge killing it in rain. Offensive rain teams appreciate Omastar's wallbreaking ability and how it reliably forces progress through setting Spikes and using Thief to steal items, limiting the longevity of opposing teams. Omastar does suffer from having very low special bulk and weaknesses to common offensive types, meaning that many Pokemon it can't OHKO such as Latios, Mewtwo, and Groudon can easily take it out, neutering offensive potential from the teams Omastar finds itself on. It also faces some competition from Qwilfish, another Swift Swim user with access to Spikes and a useful tool in Self-Destruct.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mystic Water and Toxic are both options Omastar can use instead of Thief, letting it hit harder and threaten poison on walls, respectively. The presence of Refresh Latios and Latias makes the latter much harder to pull off, though, with them threatening it out while no longer fearing losing an item. Protect Snorlax with Immunity can also take even Mystic Water-boosted hits while not fearing Toxic. A Modest nature can also be run to give Omastar more power while still outrunning maximum Speed neutral nature Deoxys-A, but no longer outspeeding maximum Speed positive nature Deoxys-A can be costly. A Petaya Berry set with Substitute can make Omastar a potent late-game sweeper, but it loses the utility of Thief or immediate damage from other options like Mystic Water.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre—Omastar's best partner—is also one of its hardest walls. Hydro Pump does little damage even in rain, and Kyogre can threaten it with an OHKO from Surf or Hydro Pump, inflict paralysis with Thunder Wave, or heal off any damage Omastar does with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey easily survives multiple Hydro Pumps and can spread status or set up Light Screen to further wall Omastar. However, it hates having its Leftovers stolen by Thief and being worn down by Spikes as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Rayquaza</strong>: Rayquaza can effectively disable Swift Swim with Air Lock, allowing it to outspeed Omastar and OHKO with Earthquake even in rain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Revenge Killers</strong>: Omastar struggles to OHKO some very powerful but bulky Pokemon even in rain such as Mewtwo, the Lati twins, and Choice Band Snorlax or Metagross, meaning they can often force Omastar to switch out or sacrifice itself for some damage.</p> <p><strong>Groudon</strong>: Groudon setting sun makes Omastar essentially unviable, removing its revenge killing niche. Groudon can also easily outspeed Omastar in sun and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Omastar functions best as a revenge killer and should be used very offensively, forcing switches against weakened or offensive Pokemon and threatening bulky ones with its item displacement ability and Spikes. Fast-paced rain teams love Spikes and Omastar's wallbreaking wearing down and threatening defensive Pokemon. When boosted by rain, Hydro Pump is an incredibly powerful STAB option, being used over weaker, more accurate Water-type moves to achieve feats such as possibly 2HKOing specially bulky Pokemon like Deoxys-D and Jirachi. Ice Beam is used for Dragon-types like Latios, Latias, and the rare defensive Salamence, as well as bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Celebi, being strong and having a good amount of PP to fire off in a longer game. Thief is a very useful move that Omastar is one of the few users of, being able to remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Blissey and Snorlax while holding no item, as well as the very important Soul Dew from Latios and Latias. This deters a lot of Pokemon from switching into Omastar making Thief a very effective and important part of its success. A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs is used to outrun maximum Speed Deoxys-A in rain.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to it succeeding best on offensively-inclined rain teams, Omastar's best partners are ones that can take advantage of it setting Spikes and stealing items to chip down common threats. Kyogre is a mandatory partner, being the only way to set permanent rain for Omastar to thrive in. With an extensive movepool, it can also pressure Blissey, Latios, and Latias, which Omastar loves having chipped or removed from the game. Petaya Berry Deoxys-A is another potent rain attacker, using mixed wallbreaking power with Superpower to threaten checks to Omastar such as Blissey and Snorlax while heavily denting others like Latias with boosted Ice Beam. Snorlax serves as a bulky check to offensive Pokemon that Omastar can't break past unless chipped, such as the Lati twins and Mewtwo, while appreciating Spikes wearing down its own checks like Forretress and Metagross. With Spikes being such a crucial part of Omastar's gameplan, Gengar works as a solid offensive spinblocker to deter Forretress, which can live a Hydro Pump from Omastar in rain. Gengar also has access to Thief, enabling a double Thief core that can displace multiple important items from the opponent.</p>"

Earthquake Snorlax and Blissey, as well as bulky Water-types such as Starmie, Suicune, and Milotic, can all take its hits easily and eventually beat it. Trace Porygon2 and Gardevoir counter the Swift Swim variant if they have Thunderbolt. Dugtrio can finish non-Swift Swim-boosted Omastar at about 60% health or lower. Just about any neutral special attack will OHKO or 2HKO Omastar, while any Grass-type move will OHKO it.

The other two moves should be used along with Leftovers. Protect can stall for additional Leftovers recovery and scout Choice Band users. This can significantly reduce prediction as, for the most part, they only have Earthquake and STAB Fighting moves with which to threaten Omastar.</p> <p>As Omastar will not be tanking any special attacks regardless of investment, it should focus on physical bulk to sponge attacks from the likes of Salamence.

Thief can be useful for stealing items, such as Choice Band and Leftovers, to help make life hard for your opponents, but Knock Off is the superior option. Confuse Ray can give you a bit more time to sweep. Body Slam has the chance to paralyze the target, which can also be useful.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Kabutops need a Speed stat of at least 264 for the Endure set. Rain Dance Kabutops only needs 8 Speed EVs to get it at 198. Swords Dance versions might want to get the maximum amount of Speed Kabutops can get. Maximum Attack is always good on Kabutops as well. Don't use a nature that lowers Kabutop's Special Attack if you plan on using a special attack, since its Special Attack is already below-average. If you're using Substitute with Flail, make sure your HP is not divisible by 4 so you are able to Substitute four times and maximize Flail's power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golem, Solrock, and Aggron counter most of Kabutops's sets because of their high Defense. but they are all weak to Surf. Kabutops cannot really hit Meganium and KO it quickly, so Meganium can Counter an attack back or KO it outright. Blastoise has good defensive stats, and because it is a Water-type, Kabutops cannot get around its Defense without being hit hard by it. Hypno can wall Kabutops fairly well because of Wish, Reflect, and its ability to status Kabutops. However, if Kabutops removes Hypno's Leftovers with Knock Off, it has a chance to put a dent in Hypno. Quagsire and Whiscash counter Kabutops in the same way Swampert does: they resist its Rock-type attacks and have decent Defense while packing a STAB Earthquake.</p>",

Surf is useful, though, for beating things like Solrock, since it and other similar Pokemon don't take as much damage from Rock Slide.

A large draw for Aerodactyl is its resistance to Normal, forcing common Choice-locked Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Rayquaza, and Snorlax to switch out, giving Aerodactyl an opening to wallbreak. Aerodactyl is still slower than Deoxys-A—the tier's best revenge killer and one of the most common Pokemon, so Aerodactyl can only act as a temporary answer to Choice Band Extreme Speed. This makes it much harder to utilize than Deoxys-A, as giving an opponent's Deoxys-A room to attack can be devastating.

Earthquake forms the EdgeQuake combination with its STAB Rock Slide to pressure a large majority of the tier, but Earthquake is punishable by the many Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate in the tier. Hidden Power Ghost deals more damage to Latios, Latias, Dusclops, and Gengar but doesn't have the STAB boost and lack of immunities that Hidden Power Flying has.

Aerodactyl's secondary Flying typing blesses it with an immunity to Earthquake and, more importantly, Spikes, allowing it to hit hard throughout the match. Finally, as if it could get any better for Aerodactyl, it's tied for the fastest Pokemon in ADV OU with Jolteon, which is OHKOed by Earthquake. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl's weakness to Ice Beam, Surf, Rock Slide, and other common moves in the ADV OU metagame prevent it from switching in as often as one would hope. Additionally, Aerodactyl's defenses are far from stellar; even non-STAB super effective moves will do significant damage to Aerodactyl, if not OHKO it outright.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aerodactyl has a pretty big movepool, but it should really stick with the given set. The only other viable set would consist of Rock Slide, Earthquake, Double-Edge, and Substitute with a Liechi Berry and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 SpD. This set takes full advantage of Aerodactyl's ability to force switches and hit hard behind a Substitute. Toxic can be used over Double-Edge to cripple incoming Water-types; if using Toxic, be sure to use Pressure as Aerodactyl's ability. Fire Blast might seem useful to roast Skarmory, but Aerodactyl can beat Skarmory with Rock Slide. Taunt might also seem viable, but that would mean forgoing the necessary Choice Band for the mediocre Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Aerodactyl is hard to counter, as it can strip away a win from you with an untimely flinch. However, Aerodactyl does have a good number of checks. Metagross and Jirachi can switch into Aerodactyl's STAB moves and retaliate with a super effective move of their own. Jirachi deserves a special mention, as it can set up Reflect and Wish, further aiding your team by lessening Aerodactyl's sweeping prowess. However, Wish + Reflect Jirachi is not a strong check to Aerodactyl, as Jirachi will forgo super effective coverage if it runs Reflect. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert can take any one attack from Aerodactyl and return the favor with a STAB Surf or Hydro Pump. Physically defensive Celebi can switch into any of Aerodactyl's moves bar Hidden Power Flying and set up Calm Mind or cripple it with Leech Seed.</p> <p>On more offensive teams, Intimidate users such as Salamence and Gyarados can lessen Aerodactyl's sweeping prowess while giving your own team a chance to sweep. It's worth noting that Salamence and Gyarados share excellent defensive synergy with Jirachi and Metagross, as they can switch into an Earthquake that was meant to hit Metagross or Jirachi, set up a Dragon Dance boost, and proceed to sweep. Claydol can take a couple of Aerodactyl's hits in the early-game and retaliate with Ice Beam; however, Claydol is sure to lose in the late-game due to its lack of reliable recovery. Although Flygon can't switch into Double-Edge, having a Rock-type resistance is necessary to prevent Aerodactyl from running through your team. Also, Flygon pairs well with Metagross and Jirachi, ensuring that you have an offensive core that will give Aerodactyl trouble due to such a pair's excellent defensive synergy. Skarmory can switch into any of Aerodactyl's moves, set up Spikes, and heal off any damage taken wth Rest. More uncommon checks to Aerodactyl include Donphan and Steelix. Steelix in particular can take on Aerodactyl throughout the game due to its resistance to most of Aerodactyl's moves and its excellent Defense stat. Remember that an untimely flinch can spell doom for your Aerodactyl check, so it's a good idea to have two Aerodactyl checks, or at least two Pokemon that can take a hit and OHKO Aerodactyl before it runs through your team. A bulky Gengar set can play such a role, as it can take Rock Slide and hit back with Thunderbolt.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Behold: one of the most dangerous late-game sweepers in ADV OU. Rock Slide is Aerodactyl's main STAB move, and combined with a Choice Band, it gives Aerodactyl the ability to demolish even sturdy walls such as Suicune and Milotic into oblivion thanks to the move's high flinch chance. Other than making foes flinch to death, Rock Slide is also useful for defeating Zapdos, Gyarados, Salamence, and opposing Aerodactyl. Double-Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest move, and combined with Rock Head, Aerodactyl can spam Double-Edge throughout the match. Double-Edge is also Aerodactyl's best choice against bulky Water-types in the early-game, ensuring that Aerodactyl can deal a blow heavy enough to where it or a teammate can sweep later in the game. Earthquake is chosen as the third option, as it provides excellent coverage alongside Rock Slide, and Flygon and Claydol, the two Pokemon that resist the combination, are hit hard by Double-Edge. Additionally, Earthquake also slams Jirachi and Metagross, two common Aerodactyl switch-ins. Hidden Power Flying rounds off the set by giving Aerodactyl a strong secondary STAB move that is useful against Fighting-types and Celebi. Hidden Power Bug hits Celebi a lot harder, and is especially useful for stopping the Calm Mind + Baton Pass variant. Hidden Power Fighting is a niche option that allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar in the presence of Spikes when the team lacks a sturdy Tyranitar counter.</p> <p>Choice Band is necessary to ensure that Aerodactyl can sweep late-game. The EV spread listed takes full advantage of Aerodactyl's excellent offensive stats; maximum Attack investment is necessary to ensure that Aerodactyl hits as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed every Pokemon with the exception of Jolteon and other Aerodactyl; the IVs ensure that Aerodactyl can Speed tie with opposing Aerodactyl and Jolteon when using Hidden Power Flying. An EV spread of 32 HP / 248 Atk / 8 SpD / 220 Spe is another viable option; this spread allows Aerodactyl to survive Gengar's Thunderbolt while still being able to outspeed Timid Raikou and Starmie.</p> <p>Aerodactyl really appreciates Spikes support to turn 3HKOs into possible 2HKOs, such as with Double-Edge against Suicune and Milotic. Specially defensive Skarmory makes for a great partner, as it can switch into a lot of the Pokemon that switch into Aerodactyl, such as Metagross, Suicune, Milotic, Swampert, and opposing Skarmory. Pokemon that can lure and either weaken or defeat Aerodactyl's checks are also fine partners. Tyranitar is one of the better offensive partners for Aerodactyl, as it can deal huge chunks of damage to many of Aerodactyl's checks and can also negate their Leftovers recovery with Sand Stream. Metagross shares good defensive synergy with Aerodactyl and can take out Skarmory and bulky Water-types with Thunder Punch and Explosion, respectively. Zapdos and Celebi are also great partners due to their ability to force out bulky Water-types, ensuring that Water-types have to switch into Spikes one more time if they want a chance to beat Aerodactyl.</p> <p>Aerodactyl really shines on offensively based Explosion teams. Prominent offensive Explosion users such as Metagross and Snorlax can defeat or severely weaken most of Aerodactyl's checks, as most teams can't handle more than one Explosion. After Water-types are eliminated, Dugtrio can trap and defeat weakened Normal-type switch-ins, such as Jirachi and Metagross, increasing Aerodactyl's chances to sweep later in the game. It's important to remember that Aerodactyl really doesn't need too much support, as it can cut through most teams with a lucky flinch. Thus, Spikes setters are probably Aerodactyl's best partners, as the move supports both Aerodactyl and the entire team. Once again, specially defensive Skarmory is an excellent Spikes user alongside Aerodactyl.  Finally, bulky Taunt + Will-O-Wisp Gengar with maximum Special Attack EVs not only blocks Rapid Spin, but also has the potential to defeat Suicune and Milotic, both of which are common Aerodactyl switch-ins.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With its high bulk, strong Attack, and expansive movepool, Snorlax is one of the tier's most effective offensive and defensive Pokemon. Curse Snorlax is one of the most difficult Pokemon to check around, being difficult to KO, offensively threatening, and able to customize its set to defeat its potential counters. Defensively, Snorlax is one of the most important checks to Latios and Latias, and it soft checks a variety of other threats including Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, Jirachi, and Regice. Snorlax is also a highly effective wallbreaker, capable of forcing trades with Curse or with STAB Self-Destruct, which is stronger than every Explosion. Immunity and Thick Fat are both useful abilities on an already good defensive Pokemon, blocking one of the most prevalent ways of stalling Snorlax out or making it a highly effective Ice- and Fire-type sponge. However, Snorlax's unboosted physical bulk is not great, and many Pokemon run Fighting-type moves almost exclusively to take advantage of it. Snorlax is also very slow and has no options to rectify this weakness beyond spreading paralysis, meaning that once it is at low health, it is effectively KOed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snorlax has the bulk to utilize Counter, but it's a high-risk, high-reward choice. Toxic can seriously punish a few conventional Snorlax responses, but most of Snorlax's common switch-ins are immune to this move. Belly Drum boosts Snorlax's Attack to absurd levels and could be paired with Rest and a Chesto Berry for instant recovery, but Snorlax checks and potential revenge killers are very common, so this set is largely outclassed by those already discussed. Sunny Day is a very niche option that can be used to punish Kyogre.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Dusclops, Gengar, and Shedinja are immune to Snorlax's most spammable move, and potentially to its entire moveset. Beyond this, each of them also has potential tools to debilitate or defeat Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Forretress</strong>: Skarmory and Forretress have high Defense, resist Snorlax's STAB moves, and are immune and neutral to Earthquake, respectively. They can proceed to set up Spikes, but they, especially Forretress, fear getting caught by Fire Blast in sun. Note Skarmory can also phaze Snorlax, while Forretress may be forced to check it via Explosion after boosts.</p> <p><strong>Other Steel-types and Regirock</strong>: Pokemon such as Metagross, Steelix, Registeel, and Regirock have high defenses, resistances to Snorlax's STAB moves, and the power to hit back hard with strong physical moves, but they fear coverage moves such as Earthquake, Focus Punch, or Fire Blast in sun.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre and Groudon</strong>: Although they dislike switching into Snorlax and may take heavy damage from its STAB attacks, Kyogre and Groudon have the sheer power to easily beat Snorlax one-on-one or break through its Curse set.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Lugia</strong>: Defensive Lugia has the bulk and longevity to pivot into Snorlax and set Reflect or threaten Curse sets with Whirlwind. However, defensive Lugia is also KOed by Self-Destruct, does not like getting hit by Toxic, and cannot threaten Snorlax if Snorlax is the last Pokemon available.</p>",

        "Offensive CurseLax": {
          "description": "<p>Curse helps Snorlax cover its mediocre physical bulk while simultaneously building enough power to wallbreak or clean late-game. Body Slam for STAB is fairly strong, accurate, and has a high chance to paralyze foes, which can help teammates, allow Snorlax to actually outspeed a threat, or grant Snorlax even more turns to set up or heal. Return is also an option for additional power, which can especially help for muscling through Pokemon such as Groudon, Kyogre, Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo. Protect is a valuable move to increase Leftovers recovery and scout moves, especially from Choice Band users—which teammates can easily handle if they lock into a Fighting-type move—or Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct such as Metagross, Forretress, and Mewtwo. Shadow Ball and Earthquake are both worthy coverage options to combat the Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-types intent on countering Snorlax such as Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, Steelix, Omastar, Dusclops, Gengar, Shedinja, Regirock, and Registeel. Shadow Ball is more common because Earthquake leaves Snorlax completely helpless against Gengar and Shedinja. Fire Blast is also notable, especially on sun teams, for blasting Skarmory and Forretress; two common Snorlax switch-ins that seek to lay Spikes. Self-Destruct sacrifices longevity and cleaning ability for maximum wallbreaking potential. Rest allows Snorlax to remove status and continue boosting against Pokemon that are unable to 4HKO it, which form a substantial portion of the tier after a Curse. Rest is most potent against stall teams, and it should typically be run alongside Shadow Ball; no Pokemon is immune to both Ghost and Normal, letting Rest Snorlax eventually break through all foes with enough boosts. Sleep Talk can be used alongside Rest to make the most of its sleep turns.</p> <p>252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature are important to minimize damage from Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo, and because Special Defense is the defensive stat Snorlax cannot increase via setup. 136 Defense EVs allow Snorlax to always avoid being 2HKOed by Groudon's Earthquake after one Curse. The remaining 120 HP EVs further increase Snorlax's overall bulk, but these can also be placed in Attack for additional damage output early on, which can be especially helpful when running Return. A more offensive EV spread of 104 HP / 152 Atk / 252 SpD can be justified on sets with Protect to supplement recovery, and it further increases Snorlax's wallbreaking potential against Kyogre, Latios, and Latias. Immunity or Thick Fat is utilized depending on team needs; Immunity prevents Toxic from debilitating Snorlax or forcing it to use Rest, while Thick Fat helps it tank attacks such as Latios's Ice Beam and Mewtwo's Fire Blast.</p> <p>CurseLax functions on a variety of teams and archetypes, and it can customize its movepool, EVs, and even ability to meet specific needs of a team. This particular set appreciates cleaners and sweepers that appreciate Snorlax's ability to pressure Groudon, Kyogre, Latios, Latias, and defensive Steel-types. Offensive CurseLax especially appreciates secondary and tertiary Latios and Latias checks, which relieve its pressure to check these threats while allowing it to wallbreak more aggressively. Therefore, Pokemon capable of taking Thunder such as Steelix, Shedinja, Blissey, Groudon, and Swampert, or Dragon Claw such as Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, or Registeel, are good teammates. Pokemon that pressure Kyogre and Groudon can help Snorlax break through them, such as Mewtwo, Metagross, Ho-Oh, Steelix, and Rayquaza. Spikes support makes offensive CurseLax especially potent, as it wears down several of its major checks, so setters such as Forretress, Skarmory, Deoxys-D, Deoxys-S, Omastar, and Qwilfish are great choices. Trappers such as Magneton and Dugtrio that can remove Steel-types are natural offensive partners.</p>"

        "Amnesia CurseLax": {
          "description": "<p>Curse helps Snorlax cover its mediocre physical bulk while simultaneously building enough offensive power to clean. Amnesia makes it nearly impossible for special attackers to break through Snorlax, being especially helpful for Latios, Latias, Kyogre, and Mewtwo. Importantly, it also lets Snorlax continually threaten several Calm Mind users and use Rest less often. Rest allows Snorlax to remove paralysis and burns, and it keeps Snorlax a long-term threat against Pokemon that are unable to 4HKO it, which form a substantial portion of the tier once it has boosted its defenses. Body Slam for STAB is fairly strong, accurate, and has a high chance to paralyze foes, which can be exploited by teammates, allow Snorlax to actually outspeed a threat, or grant Snorlax even more turns to set up or heal. The EV spread allows Snorlax to check Latios, Latias, and bulky Ho-Oh long-term; it also performs especially well against Groudon and lets Snorlax weather Mewtwo Self-Destruct into Spell Tag Deoxys-A Superpower. Immunity is utilized to prevent Snorlax from needing to use Rest for Toxic.</p> <p>Like Curse Snorlax as a whole, Amnesia CurseLax is very customizable to a team's needs and fits on many archetypes. It still appreciates a secondary Latios and Latias check to relieve its pressure to check them, especially ones that can take Thunder such as Steelix, Shedinja, Blissey, Groudon, and Swampert, or Dragon Claw such as Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, and Registeel. Pokemon that can pressure Kyogre and Groudon facilitate Snorlax cleaning through them, such as Mewtwo, Metagross, Ho-Oh, Steelix, and Rayquaza. Spikes support makes CurseLax especially potent, as it wears down several of its major checks, so setters such as Forretress, Skarmory, Deoxys-D, Deoxys-S, Omastar, and Qwilfish are great choices. Trappers such as Magneton and Dugtrio that can remove Steel-types are natural offensive partners.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>A Choice Band brings insane power to the most powerful explosion move in the game, and it further boosts Snorlax's coverage options to potentially blow past conventional checks. Shadow Ball allows Snorlax to hit Gengar and Shedinja, which it could otherwise not touch, and also tackles Dusclops. Fire Blast can be used over Shadow Ball with sun support for hitting Skarmory and Forretress. Focus Punch is viable, as it's typically only used when the opponent is forced to switch, and it does major damage to most Normal-resistant foes. Earthquake also hits most Steel- and Rock-types hard, but it has overall lower power than Focus Punch and is potentially easier to exploit with immune foes. Body Slam is a strong and accurate STAB move with a high chance to paralyze foes, which can be exploited by other teammates, allow Snorlax to potentially outspeed a target it's hit, and make Snorlax more difficult to switch into. Alternatively, Return's additional power is great for blasting through many important Pokemon such as Groudon, Kyogre, Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, and Ho-Oh. STAB Self-Destruct with a Choice Band is absurdly powerful, OHKOing any Pokemon that does not resist it and even OHKOing some that do. Immunity allows Choice Band Snorlax to safely switch into Blissey and forces Pokemon such as Lugia and Skarmory to use moves other than Toxic. Thick Fat allows Snorlax to \"resist\" Ice Beam and Fire Blast, especially from the likes of Mewtwo. A Brave nature should be used if running Fire Blast.</p> <p>Choice Band Snorlax functions best on offense teams that have several other Latios and Latias checks, thereby allowing Snorlax to take a more offensive role, so offensive checks such as Metagross, Ho-Oh, Steelix, Regice, and Deoxys-A are great picks. Spikes support helps Choice Band Snorlax break through Steel-types, Groudon, Kyogre, and several other foes more easily, so setters such as Forretress, Skarmory, Deoxys-D, Deoxys-S, Omastar, and Qwilfish make good teammates. Trappers like Magneton and Dugtrio can remove Steel-types and serve as great offensive partners. Choice Band and mixed wallbreakers or cleaners such as Groudon, Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, Ho-Oh, Metagross, Rayquaza, and Heracross can help Snorlax to overload defensive cores, especially ones with opposing Groudon and Kyogre.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a special wall with a great defensive and offensive presence thanks to its Curse set as well as its access to Self-Destruct, as taking out an extra opposing Pokemon or a sweeper that wants to overpower it can be crucial for a game. While it does have some weaknesses, namely mediocre Defense, low Speed, and a vulnerability to Spikes and sand, its strong points make it the force that defines ADV OU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast is a traditional answer to Steel-types such as Skarmory, Forretress, Metagross, and Magneton. Brick Break is not as powerful as Focus Punch, but it is an immediate answer against Tyranitar. Thunder is a powerful choice for combatting Aerodactyl, Gyarados, Cloyster, and Skarmory, and it provides a great paralysis rate. However, the accuracy is rather low, so it may mandate rain support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most counters depend on Snorlax's set.</p> <p>Skarmory, Metagross, and defensive Celebi are some of the biggest checks to Snorlax. Skarmory can come in, set up Spikes, and phaze Snorlax. If Snorlax doesn't have Earthquake, it won't do much damage to Metagross. Without Hidden Power Bug or a boost from Curse, Snorlax cannot easily 2HKO Celebi, which means it can outstall Snorlax with Leech Seed and Recover. It also shrugs off Body Slam paralysis thanks to Natural Cure and Heal Bell. To prevent itself from losing to a Snorlax with Rest, Celebi can set up Calm Mind and take down Snorlax with Psychic, as long as it is safe with Recover. However, it needs to be wary of Self-Destruct.</p> <p>Besides Skarmory and Metagross, other Steel- or Rock-types resist Snorlax's STAB attacks. Snorlax without Earthquake will be setup fodder for Calm Mind Jirachi, but Wish Jirachi can only reliably deal with the Curse non-Earthquake set. Under sand, Magnet Magneton can make Snorlax use Rest repeatedly and beat the utility set if it's not running Earthquake or Brick Break. Forretress can run Explosion or Counter to handle the utility set, though it must be wary of Fire Blast and Curse versions. The seldom-used Steelix can run Roar to phaze Snorlax and Explosion to do a ton of damage to it. If Snorlax doesn't have Focus Punch or Brick Break, it can be setup fodder for Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which also kicks up a sandstorm, which is very important for teams that lack a reliable Curse Snorlax counter to prevent it from setting up comfortably. Although Aerodactyl may be scared of being paralyzed by Snorlax's Body Slam, it can click Rock Slide to possibly make Snorlax flinch. Knock Off / Harden / Rest Armaldo is the greatest counter of all time to Snorlax, though it's uncommon.</p> <p>Virtually any Snorlax set is walled early-game by Suicune, which can remove its Curse boosts with Roar. However, Suicune gets worn down by hits pretty quickly, and Snorlax can do some major damage to it with Self-Destruct.</p> <p>If Snorlax doesn't have the right moves for Gengar, it will be beaten. However, note that Curse Snorlax can outstall Gengar that lack Taunt or Perish Song, even if it doesn't have anything to hit Gengar with.</p> <p>Fighting-types make for offensive checks or counters to Snorlax. None can repeatedly come in on STAB Return, Body Slam, or Double-Edge and live to tell the tale, but they can switch into predicted Rests, Curses, and, to an extent, coverage attacks. Afterward, Fighting-types can capitalize on Snorlax's relatively poor Defense. Importantly, Focus Punch will hurt Snorlax even after multiple Curse boosts. Heracross puts a big dent in Snorlax with Focus Punch, Brick Break, and Megahorn. Machamp and Hariyama are also decent checks.</p> <p>Weezing is physically bulky enough to take most boosted hits and can use Pain Split to feed off Snorlax's higher HP. Furthermore, Weezing has access to moves such as Haze, which will eliminate any boosts Snorlax can muster from Curse. Besides, Weezing's Will-O-Wisp will harshly reduce Snorlax's Attack while also causing a little damage. Weezing can hit relatively hard with Sludge Bomb, and if required, turn to Explosion to finish off Snorlax.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "CurseLax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Curse Snorlax can be a secondary check for special attackers such as Zapdos because it is usually buffeted by Sandstorm and doesn't have a reliable way to restore its HP. If Curse Snorlax is the last Pokemon on your team, there will be a strong possibility that you can make a comeback, as Snorlax can boost up and beat down phazers such as Skarmory, Suicune, and the rare Steelix, which can no longer use Whirlwind or Roar against it.</p> <p>Curse and Rest are obligatory moves. Since Curse Snorlax usually works as a late-game Pokemon and doesn't care about spreading paralysis as much as KOing the foe, Return is generally chosen. However, Body Slam is still an option for overall utility. Earthquake hurts Tyranitar, Jirachi, Metagross, and Magneton. Shadow Ball hits Gengar, Celebi, and Starmie for super effective damage. Hidden Power Bug strikes Celebi and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Steel not only hits Gengar but also has the benefit of hitting Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. Sleep Talk prevents Snorlax from being helpless during its two turns of Rest, though it's a niche option because of sleep turns resetting if Sleep Talk is used before switching out. Shadow Ball + Earthquake provides wide coverage, but Suicune can set up on and take out Snorlax lacking a STAB move faster than Snorlax can kill it, and even other special attackers such as Zapdos and Moltres can score critical hits if Snorlax spends too many turns attempting to take them out.</p> <p>Immunity is generally the preferred ability because it allows Snorlax to deal with Toxic users such as Blissey, Zapdos, Magneton, Milotic, and Porygon2, thus becoming a status pivot. Thick Fat has its niche because Moltres does a lot of damage to Snorlax with its Fire-type STAB moves, but Toxic is more common.</p> <p>The specified EVs allow Snorlax to guarantee a 3HKO on near-maximum physically bulky Suicune with +1 Return after sandstorm damage. 144 HP and 136 Special Defense EVs help Snorlax wall special attackers such as Zapdos and Suicune better. If your Snorlax runs Body Slam, you may wish to consider running 116 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature to OHKO 4 HP Dugtrio. If you need a better matchup against physical attacks, Impish will be an ideal nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Above all, Magneton is almost always paired with Curse Snorlax for its ability to take out Skarmory, Magneton, and a weakened or Choice-locked Metagross. Magneton can also run Rain Dance or Sunny Day, thus letting Snorlax avoid being buffeted by sandstorm. A Pursuit user such as Tyranitar traps Gengar, thus creating a juncture for Snorlax without Shadow Ball to sweep late-game. Dugtrio matches well with this set, being able to trap Celebi and Heracross as well as Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Magneton. Psychic-types such as Celebi and Claydol are common teammates. The former's Baton Pass can let trappers, namely Magneton and Dugtrio, work more easily, while the latter can not only remove Spikes with Rapid Spin but also act as a pivot for Electric-type attacks that would normally wear down Snorlax.</p>"

        "Utility Lax": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Self-Destruct is Snorlax's strongest attack, powerful enough to even damage Rock- or Steel- types. Snorlax usually uses Body Slam with this set, especially if it runs standard non-maximum Attack EVs, because paralyzing Suicune, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Skarmory is quite nice. Return has extra power, and if you invest enough Attack EVs, it can 2HKO some versions of Zapdos. Shadow Ball hits Gengar super effectively if your team doesn't have Pursuit support and does good damage to Celebi and Starmie. Focus Punch OHKOes Tyranitar on the switch or when it clicks Dragon Dance and does good damage to Skarmory, though you should be wary of Drill Peck variants. Earthquake hurts Tyranitar, Jirachi, Metagross, and Magneton. Curse + Self-Destruct deals with Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Metagross. Counter is a decent answer to physical attackers such as Metagross.</p> <p>The specified EVs allow Snorlax to guarantee a KO on 4 HP Dugtrio with Body Slam. The Speed investment makes Snorlax just faster than paralyzed 394 Speed Pokemon, namely Aerodactyl and Jolteon. If your team wants Snorlax to hit Skarmory harder with Focus Punch, you may want more Attack investment. 24 HP and 184 Special Defense EVs are needed to take Modest 252 Special Attack Zapdos's Thunderbolt and +1 Modest Suicune's Hydro Pump more comfortably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snorlax without Focus Punch is best suited to a Magneton-aided balance or offense team, especially Magneton-based physical spam. With Hidden Power Fire, Magneton can trap Earthquake Forretress more reliably. If Snorlax runs Focus Punch, it should generally be used on offensive teams without Spikes. Flying-types such as Salamence and Gyarados are great partners because Snorlax appreciates their Fighting-type resistance. If Snorlax can remove its typical counters such as Metagross and Tyranitar, it will be easier to sweep. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar combine with Snorlax excellently, being able to trap Gengar, thus letting Snorlax give up Shadow Ball and use Self-Destruct more comfortably. Although Houndoom is a niche Pokemon, it removes defensive Celebi, which is a solid answer to Snorlax without Hidden Power Bug.</p>"

The HP investment lets Dragonite take Ice Beam from most Swampert, and the Speed EVs enable unboosted Dragonite to outspeed neutral-natured Magneton and Breloom, as well as Pokemon that hit 361 Speed after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Dragonite works best when used on a team that can force switches and provide Spikes support. You can consider using Heal Bell to let Dragonite set up on Thunder Wave, but if not, you should play him carefully and make sure to keep him healthy.</p>"

Nothing resists both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt except Shedinja, Lanturn, and Magneton: of these, Shedinja dies to sandstorm damage, the former two are uncommon, and the latter two can be taken care of by Focus Punch. Special walls, such as Regice, Blissey, and Snorlax, also can't take a super effective Focus Punch to the stomach. SubPunch Dragonite doesn't pack the punch that the Dragon Dance variant does, and can't clean up as easily, but it sure is something to watch out for if you don't carry the right counters.</p> <p>The SubPunch set is the toughest to EV. You'll want to concentrate on Dragonite's HP, as well as his offensive stats. Pick either an Attack- or Special Attack-raising and Speed-lowering nature, and balance both his offenses.</p>"},
        "Mixed Attacker": {"description": "<p>This set is a variation to the one above, but has a more specific idea behind it. With the EVs listed, Dragonite should be able to dent Regice, Snorlax, and Blissey severely with Focus Punch, to the point where even sandstorm damage will finish them off. Hidden Power Flying is stronger and makes Dragonite a better finisher, but Hidden Power Grass lets Dragonite 2HKO Swampert, and isn't much weaker than Thunderbolt against Waters such as Milotic and Suicune. However, note that said Water-types outspeed Dragonite and often pack Ice Beam. The moves in the last moveslot are interchangeable to an extent; it all depends on your team. Speaking of teammates, this Dragonite should be paired with Tyranitar for residual sandstorm damage.</p> <p>Go with the EVs listed unless running Hidden Power Flying; if so, Dragonite will need less Attack EVs to finish off the targeted special walls. You can put these leftover EVs into HP or Special Defense.</p>"},
        "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>The main reason to use Choice Band Dragonite over Salamence is the movepool difference. Dragonite has Focus Punch, which can do huge damage to Suicune and other Water-types; in fact, it hits just as hard as Choice Band Tyranitar's Focus Punch. Dragonite can also hit these threats hard with an Electric move, and Thunder's paralysis chance might help as well. Ice Beam is an option here to deal more damage to Donphan, Claydol, and other Ground-types not named Swampert, but Dragonite will have to take out Skarmory with Focus Punch or in another way.</p> <p>Aim for as much Attack as possible, enough Speed to hit a stat of 244, and put the rest in HP.

        "Offensive Dragon Dance": {"description": "<p>This Dragonite is nearly guaranteed to take out Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert if they switch in on Dragonite when he is at full health. This set works as follows: Dragon Dance on the switch-in, then use Hidden Power Flying to weaken them. Dragonite should survive the Ice Beam, but be weakened enough that Liechi Berry will trigger. Hidden Power Flying will KO most opponents bar a low damage roll, but this is where the massively powerful Double-Edge comes in. Dragonite should usually survive the recoil, but even if he doesn't, you can now bring in one of the many Pokemon that have a great chance at sweeping opposing teams lacking a capable bulky Water.</p> <p>The EVs listed are most effective, but if you want to variate, just make sure Dragonite can survive a non-STAB Ice Beam off around 263 Special Attack.</p>"}

  "Mewtwo": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Mewtwo is one of the fastest Pokemon in the Ubers metagame, with a practically unmatched base 130 Speed. It also possesses a Special Attack stat that even surpasses Kyogre, a movepool that covers almost every scenario, and the bulk to back it all up. Mewtwo's movepool is vast enough that it leaves the opponent always guessing what moveset it's running, with even physical sets also being an option. However, its Psychic typing leaves it susceptible to some of the metagame's biggest threats in Snorlax and Deoxys-A, which check it defensively and offensively, respectively. Moreover, Mewtwo often struggles to fit everything it wants in just four moves. While its potential is practically limitless, its sets are usually telegraphed based on just the item revealed. However, mind games can still be played with the opponent up until the final move is revealed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed set similar to the Bulk Up set carrying Ice Beam or Thunder instead will have a better matchup versus Lugia and Ho-Oh, but it both sacrifices bulk and worsens your matchup against Snorlax. Choice Band Mewtwo can be a powerful breaker that overwhelms its checks alongside other strong physical attackers, but it can only realistically fit on teams that aim to blow up on their competition, something that regular Mewtwo can already do while simultaneously breaking physical walls with its strong special attacks. Taunt is an option on the lead set to be able to take on Deoxys-D leads, but the utility Calm Mind provides is way more valuable in most cases, especially since Taunt only lasts for two turns in ADV. Hidden Power Rock on more physically inclined sets lets Mewtwo defeat Ho-Oh without relying on Thunder's low accuracy and weather, but it is extremely situational, as it only hits one specific threat that can be dealt with through Mewtwo's teammates.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is a great answer to Mewtwo sets not running Focus Punch, being able to take on the combination of any special attack followed up by Self-Destruct while threatening to 2HKO with either Shadow Ball or Return. Snorlax can also use Protect on a predicted Self-Destruct to save its HP. However, if it's more offensive rather than bulky, it has to be wary of Thunder's damage output and chance to paralyze.</p> <p><strong>Deoxys-D</strong>: Deoxys-D can stop Mewtwo from setting up with Taunt, slowly chip it with Night Shade, remove its item with Knock Off, and inflict it with status, but it has to be wary of sets running Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Dusclops</strong>: Dusclops can switch in on Mewtwo's Self-Destruct while also having enough bulk to take on its special attacks and retaliate with Shadow Ball or keep its HP high with Pain Split. It has to be wary of sets running Taunt, though, as they tend to shut it down completely.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh is usually seen on sun teams and can rely on Thunder's low accuracy and its natural bulk to be able to take on any of Mewtwo's other moves while threatening it out with a strong physical attack. If Thunder does land, however, Ho-Oh will take a lot of damage, so it has to be extremely careful.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Weather sweepers like Exeggutor, Victreebel, and Omastar, Jolly Aerodactyl, and priority users in Rayquaza and Deoxys-A can all attack before Mewtwo and pick it off with their strong attacks if it's been sufficiently weakened. Deoxys-A in particular can always outspeed and threaten to OHKO Mewtwo with Shadow Ball. None of them can safely switch in, though, as they can be OHKOed by Mewtwo's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross can OHKO Mewtwo with Megahorn and either force it to switch out or use Self-Destruct, but it has to scout for the rare Fire Blast, which can easily OHKO it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Boom Lead": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is designed to beat all of the common leads while also having staying power if you decide to keep it around for later use. Ice Beam and Thunder threaten Groudon and Kyogre, allowing your respective weather setter to set themselves up nicely while also paving the way for Mewtwo's teammates to sweep. Ice Beam also 2HKOes the common Latios lead, while Mewtwo isn't threatened by any move it runs, thus forcing it out early. It similarly pressures Latias leads, which are KOed by the combination of Ice Beam and Self-Destruct. Thunderbolt is an option over Thunder if you are scared of the low accuracy that Thunder has outside of rain. It also provides a consistent way to damage Ho-Oh in sun, a common switch-in, but it comes with the downside of worsening the Kyogre matchup. Self-Destruct allows Mewtwo to trade itself for one of the opponent's valuable team members, giving control of the game's momentum at any given time. This can be used to remove a foe like Blissey, which cannot survive the combination of a special attack followed up by Self-Destruct, or offensive Ho-Oh, or it can be used to severely chip a defensive wall that is problematic for the rest of your team. Due to the turn ending once Mewtwo uses Self-Destruct, the opponent cannot recover HP afterwards. Calm Mind allows Mewtwo to set up in front of the aforementioned Latios and Latias. Importantly, this allows Mewtwo to OHKO Kyogre and Groudon with Thunder and Ice Beam, respectively, and avoid the OHKO from any of their offensive moves. Mewtwo has to be wary of Hydro Pump variants of Kyogre, however, as it cannot survive a hit without a Calm Mind boost, but it also can't set up consistently in front of Kyogre because Surf variants can 2HKO regardless. Some Snorlax sets can be 3HKOed by +1 Thunder while Mewtwo avoids the 2HKO from Body Slam. Fire Blast can deal with the Steel-types that might want to try and switch in to take Self-Destruct, such as Jirachi and Metagross, as well as lead Heracross, which otherwise threatens Mewtwo into switching out or trading itself. Attack investment isn't necessary, seeing how Mewtwo's Attack stat is just large enough to get the KOs it is after with some prior chip. A Mild nature optimizes Mewtwo's lead matchup, avoiding the OHKO from physical attacks such as Groudon's Earthquake and Snorlax's Body Slam and special attacks such as from Latios and Latias. Lum Berry allows Mewtwo to act as a pseudo-status absorber, ignoring potential Thunder Waves from Kyogre and Groudon, as well as the secondary effects of Ice Beam, Thunder, and Body Slam. Mewtwo's base 130 Speed allows it to outspeed positive-natured base 110 Pokemon such as Lugia, Latios, and Latias with a neutral nature. A spread running 220 Speed EVs and 36 HP EVs lets Mewtwo take hits just a slight bit better while still outspeeding the same targets, but it comes at the cost of always losing the mirror matchup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mewtwo can fit on pretty much every team and playstyle, but it's preferable on offense for its ability to effectively remove any threat with Self-Destruct or even act as a wallbreaker utilizing Calm Mind. Kyogre allows Mewtwo to hit perfectly accurate Thunders and appreciates Mewtwo weakening its checks in Latios, Latias, and Blissey. Similarly, Mewtwo enjoys Kyogre dealing with the Steel-types that it cannot always beat and Kyogre's ability to sponge hits from its checks such as Ho-Oh and Deoxys-A. Groudon can cover most of what Mewtwo cannot, being an effective check to Snorlax and Deoxys-A that also enjoys the Eon twins being either weakened or removed entirely. Offensive Groudon sets such as the SubSalac set can sweep the opposing team with more ease if its checks like Lugia and Ho-Oh have been damaged enough. Physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Heracross and Metagross pair up well with Mewtwo, with Mewtwo exposing their checks' usually low Special Defense sets or trading its health with their own. Snorlax similarly enjoys Mewtwo being able to check Latios and Latias so that it can function more as a mid-game breaker rather than a wall. Deoxys-A shares a lot of checks with Mewtwo and can thus overwhelm with its strong physical moves once they've been weakened enough.</p>"

        "Substitute + Bulk Up": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to lure in common switch-ins to the standard Mewtwo set and blow them back with a physical move. Substitute in tandem with 204 HP EVs allows Mewtwo to create Substitutes that can withstand a Seismic Toss from Blissey and Dusclops and lets Mewtwo fish for misses from inaccurate moves such as Heracross's Megahorn and Thunder outside of rain. Bulk Up allows Mewtwo to beat common physical walls such as Forretress and boost alongside Snorlax. Shadow Ball hits Latios and Latias for super effective damage and is Mewtwo's best move to spam, as it hits most of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Focus Punch pairs well with Substitute and has perfect coverage with Shadow Ball. Earthquake is an option to hit Steel-types such as Metagross and Jirachi harder than Focus Punch while also not requiring a Substitute or correct prediction to function, serving as a strong midground. 96 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Mewtwo to hit 352 Speed, which is just enough to outpace maximum Speed Latios, Latias, and Lugia.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong Normal-type attackers such as Snorlax and Slaking form a good pair with this Mewtwo set, as there is good offensive overlap. Mewtwo shares checks with them, so they all benefit from Steel-types such as Forretress being gradually chipped from their strong physical attacks. Mewtwo also significantly damages common answers to these Normal-types like Deoxys-D and Lugia. Kyogre pairs quite well, being able to switch into the physical attacks thrown Mewtwo's way while also dealing with the walls Mewtwo struggles to break such as Ho-Oh. Mewtwo can chip Latios, Latias, and Blissey in return, all of which are roadblocks for Kyogre. Groudon is a fantastic partner regardless of its set, with the defensive set being able to take on the physical attackers that Mewtwo can't switch into such as Deoxys-A and Ho-Oh, while the SubSalac set uses the Steel-types that Mewtwo invites in as setup opportunities. In return, Mewtwo removes opposing Psychic-types that often stop Groudon in its tracks such as the Eon twins, opposing Mewtwo, and Lugia. Magneton can remove the Steel-types that Mewtwo sometimes struggles to deal with such as Forretress and also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave so Mewtwo can set up Substitute more freely. Spikes from Deoxys-D, Skarmory, and Forretress is much appreciated, as Mewtwo forces multiple switches upon its set reveal. It also turns various 3HKOs into 2HKOs, such as Metagross switching into an Earthquake.</p>"

        "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to utilize Mewtwo's demonstrably large Special Attack and good bulk to act as either a mid-game breaker or even a late-game setup sweeper. Thunder and Ice Beam have perfect coverage, only being mutually resisted by Magneton, which easily gets overwhelmed by this set. Thunderbolt is a safer option to deal with sun teams better, but the drop-off in power is immediately noticeable, with Ho-Oh and Forretress both avoiding the 2HKO from it. The HP EVs allow Mewtwo to create Substitutes that can withstand a Seismic Toss from Blissey and Night Shade from Deoxys-D. Substitute is utilized to avoid status moves and also scout for the foe's set, avoiding unfavorable trades such as Explosion from Metagross and Self-Destruct from Snorlax. 220 Speed EVs let Mewtwo outspeed positive-natured base 110 Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Lugia.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Groudon is a good partner, as it provides sun support for Mewtwo so that it can't get frozen by Ice Beam. In return, Mewtwo can deal with Kyogre, Latios, and Latias, all of which are common switch-ins for Groudon. Moreover, Groudon can spread status with either Thunder Wave or Toxic and scare out common Mewtwo checks such as Steel-types and Snorlax. Physical variants of Deoxys-A can pick off weakened foes with its strong attacks or chip the opponent's Steel-types so that Mewtwo can more easily sweep in the later parts of the game. Ho-Oh is also a fantastic partner, being able to burn physical attackers with Sacred Fire, hinder them with Toxic, or deal a great deal of damage with Hidden Power Flying and Shadow Ball. Meanwhile, Mewtwo can stand up to physical walls that Ho-Oh is unable to immediately break, such as Groudon and Lugia. Mewtwo doesn't want to immediately take on the various Steel-types, so Forretress and Skarmory both chipping them gradually with Spikes support and also being a switch-in to their strong physical attacks makes them ideal partners for Mewtwo. Latios is a fantastic partner for this Mewtwo set because they both pressure Snorlax with their special attacks, making Snorlax struggle to cover both of them.</p>"

        "StallTwo": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set attempts to act as a stallbreaker, a job Mewtwo can fulfill rather well thanks to its great Speed tier and large support moveset. Taunt shuts down opposing walls in tandem with Pressure, easily PP stalling them. It also lets Mewtwo beat Pokemon that don't run any attacking moves, such as Lugia. Toxic can put bulky walls and powerful attackers on a timer alike. Flamethrower lets Mewtwo hit the Steel-types that Toxic doesn't affect while also dealing decent neutral damage if rain isn't up. Thunder can be used if you're opting to run rain, hitting Steel-types for a decent amount of damage, as well as Ho-Oh, which otherwise is unfazed by the rest of your set. The EVs provided allow Mewtwo to outrun positive-natured Latios, Latias, and Lugia while maximizing Mewtwo's special bulk. This allows Mewtwo to inflict them with Toxic effectively and use Taunt on them to stop them from recovering their HP or curing their status affliction with Refresh.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mewtwo is susceptible to getting functionally removed from the game if it gets frozen, so Groudon pairs nicely by setting sun, which also boosts up Mewtwo's damage output with Flamethrower. In return, Mewtwo can deal with the special attackers that wish to take advantage of Groudon. Cleric support in case Mewtwo gets statused is very beneficial, so Blissey and Celebi can both provide that while checking various breakers that Mewtwo cannot such as Calm Mind Kyogre and Curse Snorlax, respectively. Physically defensive Spikes setters such as Deoxys-D, Skarmory, and Forretress form a good pair with Mewtwo, as Mewtwo can take on the special attacks thrown their way while forcing switches while they take on the breakers Mewtwo invites in such as Snorlax. Ho-Oh fits on teams that feature this Mewtwo set quite well, being able to take on opposing Ho-Oh, which is a major threat to Mewtwo, while Mewtwo can take on the physical walls that Ho-Oh struggles with such as Deoxys-D and Blissey if not running Hidden Power Flying. Kyogre can take on Groudon and Ho-Oh, both of which can deal with Mewtwo to some extent, and give it a perfectly accurate Thunder.</p>"

        "Calm Mind MonoAttacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set aims to take over the game once the foes that threaten to OHKO Mewtwo are gone. Taunt, while lasting only for two turns, allows Mewtwo to beat phazers and opposing setup sweepers alike. This combination of moves allows Mewtwo to take on Blissey and defensive Lugia regardless of their sets. Ice Beam hits the greatest array of physical attackers for at least neutral damage, with notable exceptions being Steel-types and Thick Fat Snorlax. Psychic deals more damage to Ho-Oh and Snorlax but comes at the cost of dealing significantly less damage to the many Psychic-types of the metagame such as Latios, Latias, and Lugia while still being resisted by Steel-types, most of which are physical attackers and can thus break through Mewtwo. The given EV spread with a Timid nature always makes it faster than Latios, Latias, and Lugia while giving it as much physical bulk as possible to better take on physical attackers such as Groudon and Snorlax and survive a hit from Choice Band Deoxys-A.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Groudon sets sun so that Mewtwo cannot be frozen and is thus less vulnerable to RNG while also scaring away Steel-types. In return, Mewtwo can deal with problematic physical walls such as Deoxys-D, Celebi, and Lugia, which can all be cumbersome for Groudon to bypass. Spikes makes Mewtwo's job of sweeping much easier by providing some nice passive damage. As a result, Deoxys-D, Skarmory, and Forretress can all make for great partners while also dealing with the Steel-types that otherwise make Mewtwo's job rather difficult. Mewtwo struggles to break past Steel-types, so teammates that can answer to their attacks such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh pair well with it. In return, Mewtwo can take on their checks such as Blissey and the Eon twins. Choice Band Deoxys-A can revenge kill Mewtwo if Mewtwo has taken any chip, so Pokemon that can remove Deoxys-A are appreciated. Pursuit users such as Metagross, Umbreon, and your own Deoxys-A force Deoxys-A out and remove it quite effectively. As this set is usually fit for bulkier teams, cleric support from the likes of Blissey or Celebi is appreciated. They can take Kyogre and Snorlax on, respectively, both of which stop Mewtwo short from sweeping.</p>"

Hypnosis can take a Pokemon out of commission, but its horrible accuracy and direct competition with Thunder Wave mostly makes it undesirable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Mew's offensive stats are not good enough to break through Ho-Oh, which can avoid a 2HKO from Thunder and force Mew to use Explosion in quite a telegraphed manner.

Fire Blast puts Groudon in KO range of Explosion and beats Steel-types that might want to switch in to take the Explosion. Explosion removes anything that doesn't resist it, paving the way for sweepers such as Mewtwo and Deoxys-A. 80 Defense EVs avoid a 2HKO from standard Groudon and an OHKO from Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball, while 52 Special Defense EVs allow Mew to avoid being 2HKOed by Latios's Dragon Claw and OHKOed by offensive Kyogre's Hydro Pump. 20 Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed Deoxys-D and most defensive Kyogre and Groudon.

To ensure the stats recipient is as safe as possible, both Reflect and Light Screen as well as Substitute should be set before passing stats to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Ledian only fits on Baton Pass chains, ideal teammates are stat passers like Mawile, Plusle, and Delcatty as well as a recipient. Octillery is the best option as a recipient due to Suction Cups preventing it from being phazed and its great power and coverage making it essentially impossible to wall once it has stat boosts.</p>"

There is absolutely no chance that Crobat will ever break past the likes of Swampert, Skarmory, Steelix, Weezing, Donphan, and Forretress. Suicune's high Defense lets it take Sludge Bomb well, and while Milotic's Defense isn't as good, Marvel Scale will make it even bulkier if Milotic is poisoned.

In addition, Lanturn is one of the few Pokemon that can effectively stop offensive Calm Mind Suicune, who is a huge threat that many teams have difficulty dealing with.</p> <p>However, without large investment in Special Attack, Lanturn lacks firepower. It suffers from a crippling weakness to the very common Ground-type attacks, and its lack of phazing capability leaves it setup bait to the likes of Calm Mind Celebi and Curse Snorlax. It is also vulnerable to all forms of passive damage, and hates poison unless it is running a RestTalk set. Nonetheless, its glut of resistances and immunities to common attacks, along with its good bulk, makes it a worthwhile addition to most teams that need a bulky Water-type.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Substitute + three attacks set works well on Lanturn; once Blissey and Celebi are removed, it will prove to be a thorn in the side of typical stall teams that use a combination of Suicune, Zapdos, and Skarmory. Dugtrio therefore makes a good partner to the aforementioned set due to its ability to remove Blissey and Celebi. However, this set is setup fodder for Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax, and is also unable to recover efficiently.</p> <p>Toxic is an interesting option to use over Confuse Ray on the parafusion set; it can even be considered over Surf on the RestTalk set, but is not recommended as it allows Dugtrio a free switch. Nonetheless, it can wear down Lanturn's counters, such as Swampert. Hydro Pump is an alternative STAB option, but its low PP is an issue in longer games, and it does not give enough extra power over Surf to merit use. Thunder is a viable option on the RestTalk set if you want Lanturn to be able to spread status, but its low accuracy is a major turn-off. Even though Lanturn is bulky enough to afford the occasional miss, it could miss a crucial KO on a threat such as Explosion Cloyster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Celebi is the best Lanturn counter in the game as it resists both Lanturn's STAB moves, does not fear paralysis, and is able to use Leech Seed to chip away Lanturn's HP. Celebi can also set up Calm Mind boosts on Lanturn with impunity. Swampert is immune to Electric-type attacks, takes little from Surf, and can do heavy damage with Earthquake or set up with Curse; it needs to watch out for Toxic, however. Snorlax has an awesome Special Defense stat, can take any hit that Lanturn dishes out, and sets up Curse on it fearlessly. Blissey stops Lanturn cold, but can't really hurt it back. It will always win a stall war one-on-one, however. Metagross can take anything Lanturn throws at it and can OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p>Venusaur resists both of Lanturn's STAB moves and can wear it down with Leech Seed or hit it hard with Razor Leaf. It can even set up with Swords Dance on it. However, Venusaur needs to avoid paralysis and Ice Beam. Exeggutor is in the same boat as Venusaur, but it also needs to watch out for paralysis and Ice Beam if attempting to sweep.</p> <p>Finally, although it can't switch in on Surf or Ice Beam, Dugtrio can trap and revenge kill Lanturn.</p>",

With reliable recovery in Rest and Volt Absorb constantly bringing it back up to high health, it is very durable. Sleep Talk stops Lanturn from being dead weight when asleep, and also means that it is not reliant on cleric support. Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB move that provides decent coverage alongside Surf. Alternatively, Ice Beam provides better coverage in general, allows Lanturn to hit Zapdos harder, and also puts a large dent into Grass- and Dragon-types--such as Venusaur and Flygon, respectively--that love to switch in on it. Celebi, however, shrugs off Ice Beam damage and can Recover any lost health.</p> <p>This set is easily trapped and killed by Dugtrio as it has to Rest at some point, which allows Dugtrio to switch in freely; Dugtrio can alternatively come in on a predicted Thunderbolt. When using this set, make sure that Lanturn attacks first with Surf or Ice Beam--as opposed to Thunderbolt--so that Dugtrio cannot freely switch in. Be careful about when you choose to let it use Rest as well.</p> <p>The given spread allows Lanturn to reach 401 HP, which means that it can survive five Seismic Tosses with Leftovers recovery, switch into three layers of Spikes four times, and also survive eight turns of Leech Seed damage. Maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature allow it to deal decent damage. The rest of the EVs are placed in Special Defense to maximize Lanturn's special bulk.</p> <p>Skarmory is an awesome partner for this set because of its immunity to Ground and 4x resistance to Grass, as well as its ability to check physical threats such as Snorlax and Salamence. In return, Lanturn can switch into Electric- and Fire-types attacks while beating Skarmory's counters, such as Starmie, one-on-one.</p>"

        "Parafusion": {
          "description": "<p>This set, as opposed to absorbing status like the RestTalk set, aims to spread status of its own around the opponent's team. It is best utilized alongside Spikes support, as Spikes puts opponents in a catch-22 situation; they are forced to make the difficult decision between staying in on Lanturn while confused and possibly taking confusion damage, or switching out and taking Spikes damage. Parafusion is also an excellent method to allow your hard-hitting Pokemon to switch in with more ease. Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray are the two most important moves on this set as they form the parafusion combination, while Thunderbolt is an obligatory STAB. There are two choices for the last slot--Surf provides another reliable STAB, while Ice Beam is an option for better type coverage, especially on the Grass-types that Lanturn despises. When using this set, like the RestTalk set, attack first with Surf or Ice Beam so Dugtrio can't just freely switch in and dispatch Lanturn.</p> <p>The issues with this set are its lack of reliable recovery outside of Volt Absorb and its vulnerability to being stalled or poisoned. Despite the fact that Lanturn can switch into Electric-type attacks with impunity and regain health, a good opponent can predict its switch-ins and wear it down by Spikes, sandstorm, status, or simply prediction. Additionally, many Electric-types now favor Hidden Power Grass or Toxic over Hidden Power Ice to hit Swampert, which reduces Lanturn's ability to wall them.</p> <p>This set synergizes excellently with all three of OU's premier Spikes users--Cloyster, Forretress, and Skarmory--not only type-wise, but also by forcing switches through inflicting confusion. Cloyster is also a large help to Lanturn in that it spins away the Spikes that this Lanturn dislikes. This set also works well alongside sweepers and hard-hitters such as Gyarados and Aerodactyl. Not only does Lanturn make it easier for them to switch in and fire off attacks or set up by paralyzing and confusing the opponent's Pokemon, the two aforementioned Pokemon also bait Electric-type moves for Lanturn to switch into and gain health from. This set is easily worn down by status; as such, clerics in general make good partners.</p>"

Alongside Early Bird, Reflect, and Rest, Natu is able to become a relatively bulky sweeper. However, this set takes many turns to become a threat and Natu is still susceptible to being overpowered even through Reflect and Calm Mind. Any other variant of Calm Mind is mostly outclassed by Spoink, which has much better defensive use and a wider movepool. Wish can be used as a foe is switching out to recover health on Natu or a teammate, but Natu's poor defenses make this a risky option to use. Night Shade can deal damage for very percentages of health in the very low HP stat metagame of ZU. But Natu's main STAB attack, Psychic, has good neutral coverage and power already and many of its checks don't even resist it, although Night Shade does hit Steel-types harder. Baton Pass could be used to generate momentum for powerful wallbreakers as foes switch out, but this would force it to drop Substitute.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types have the bulk and resistance to take Psychic while also being immune to Toxic. Magnemite and Aron can comfortably take any move Natu commonly uses and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Natu's Speed tier is quite good, but it's not elite. Faster offensive Pokemon like Pidgeotto, Elekid, and Delibird can outrun and threaten to OHKO Natu if it is not behind a Substitute. Aipom deserves special mention, as it has the natural bulk to comfortably take a Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If they manage to avoid a Toxic, specially bulky Pokemon like Chinchou and Lileep can switch into a Psychic and threaten Natu with their STAB attacks. However, they can be stalled out by Natu if they swap directly into a Toxic or Substitute. Delcatty is especially good in this role; it has the special bulk to tank Psychics, can 2HKO Natu with Body Slam, and can even remove status from itself and its teammates with Heal Bell.</p>",

        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<p>Despite seemingly being outclassed due to Spoink's superior base stats and defensive utility, Natu has some key traits that allow it to carve out a niche as a Substitute and Toxic user. Psychic is a solid STAB-type with few checks in the tier. Notably, a super effective hit on Poison-types like Dustox and Grimer narrows the pool of Pokemon that can check Natu. Thanks to Natu's solid base 70 Speed, it can use Substitute in front of Pokemon that could tank a Psychic such as Spoink and Chinchou, while at minimum Speed tying Castform, which regularly does not fully invest in Speed. Toxic racks up damage on the many special tank checks to Natu like Castform and Lileep, particularly synergizing with Substitute due to the free turns it provides. Protect primarily allows Natu to stall more turns while the opponent is badly poisoned, but the extra turns of recovery from Leftovers and scouting it provides are appreciated as well. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative that allows Natu to immediately KO even specially defensive variants of Rhyhorn and pressure defensive Staryu without expending Psychic PP, although it becomes easier to force Natu out when it can't Protect to force additional Toxic damage. Maximum Speed and a Timid nature are used so that Natu can confidently outspeed Pokemon like Seaking, Chinchou, and Cyndaquil. 12 EVs HP are used to maximize Leftovers recovery, while the rest are dedicated to Special Attack. Both of Natu's abilities can be useful; Early Bird allows Natu to switch directly into Butterfree's Sleep Powder and wake up relatively quickly, while Synchronize can punish the very common Thunder Wave, Will-O Wisp, and Toxic at the cost of crippling Natu.</p> <p>Natu should be used on balance and offense teams which can take advantage of the pressure it applies, and Pokemon that serve as reliable switch-ins to faster attackers that threaten to OHKO Natu are ideal teammates. Spikes have excellent synergy with Natu, as the damage dealt to foes switching in combined with Toxic's increasing damage makes it very difficult to answer. Snorunt stands out as a Spiker with a strong offensive profile, although Pineco's Explosion can also get the ball rolling for Natu. Elekid sits in a nearly uncontested Speed tier, allowing it to clean up teams Natu has weakened and revenge kill targets like Pidgeotto and chipped Aipom. Swift Swim attackers like Horsea are similarly effective, running through teams once roadblocks like Chinchou and Bayleef have been put into KO range. Natu isn't powerful enough that it can threaten immediate KOs for offense teams, so other Pokemon that can such as Wailmer, Choice Band Aipom, and Seaking are great partners. Natu provides very little defensive utility, so it requires partners that can swap into attacks directed at it. Magnemite is a great partner, resisting many common Rock- and Normal-type attacks, keeping up offensive pressure, and even potentially trapping the other Steel-types that wall Natu. Koffing is another great pairing thanks to its mix of offense and defense. Its great physical bulk allows it to easily switch into unboosted physical attacks and threaten foes with Will-O-Wisp or its strong attacking movepool.</p>"

Xatu is simply outclassed by so many Pokemon, it's rarely worth the effort. At least it can come in on Choice Band Earthquakes.</p>",

Xatu resists Fighting x4, so if you give it Quick Attack, it can be a Reversal counter.

Xatu can use Hidden Power Ice to get a surprise OHKO on Gligar, something Hypno and Grumpig can't do without taking a Swords Danced hit, and Gligar might expect Ice Punch from them and switch out, anyway.</p> <p>Rest can be used with the Trait Early Bird to make Rest last a single turn, or you can use it with Synchronize to switch into status, Synchronize it, and then Rest off the status later, and when you wake up, Xatu can Synchronize someone else. This is probably best done with a Sleep Talk set, however, so Xatu isn't completely a sitting duck while it's Sleeping. Thunder Wave or Toxic can be added on as status.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Xatu should go to 310 Speed max, as that will make Xatu faster than neutral nature Scyther, Electabuzz, and Manectric, as well as Jolly Kangaskhan and Timid Pikachu; this requires 224 Speed EVs and a +Speed nature. 301 Speed makes it faster than Jolly Hitmonlee, Adamant Fearow, and neutral nature Tentacruel, as well as Jolly Gligar; this requires 192 EVs and a +Speed nature. 280 Speed beats Adamant Kangaskhan and Modest Pikachu; Xatu needs 216 EVs and a neutral nature to reach this. The lowest most Xatu should go is probably 270 Speed, to beat Adamant Gligar; this needs 176 EVs and a neutral nature.</p> <p>Supporter Xatu should max HP, and put the rest in Special Attack, whereas sweeper Xatu should do the opposite--max Special Attack, and put the rest in HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>OU counters: Snorlax, Regice, and Blissey will easily stop any special set, and won't take enough damage from a physical hit if you try and run a Choice Band Xatu for the surprise factor to make it worth it. Xatu can potentially use Wish and Calm Mind to actually beat Blissey, unless it has Toxic, or can Calm Mind itself, but even Thunder Wave will ruin Xatu's chance at a sweep when they just bring in a physical attacker and OHKO you. Tyranitar and Metagross laugh at anything Xatu can throw at them, except Dragon Dancing Tyranitar won't like Thunder Wave. Raikou, Zapdos, and other Electric Pokemon can do more damage than Xatu can defend against with Calm Mind and Wish. Any physical attacker that isn't weak to Psychic can put the hurt on Xatu, really.</p> <p>UU counters: Manectric, Electabuzz, and other Electrics can damage Xatu too fast, just like in OU. Solrock and Lunatone laugh at anything Xatu can throw at it, save Hidden Power Dark, and even that won't do enough to counter Solrock's Rock Slide or Shadow Ball. Aggron doesn't care about Thunder Wave that much, resists Psychic and Hidden Power Dark, and has STAB Rock Slide to annihilate Xatu. Sableye is immune to Psychic and can hit Xatu hard with STAB Shadow Ball or Feint Attack. Banette OHKOs Xatu with Shadow Ball, but doesn't have the Special Defense to switch in that often. Kangaskhan takes very little from Xatu's attacks, and can just beat it down with STAB Return or Shadow Ball, and, if it is abusing Early Bird Rest, you can't even cripple it with Thunder Wave. Hypno and Grumpig can just come in and Calm Mind up with you, and they will win the Calm Mind war most of the time, especially if they have Ice Punch or Thunder Punch.</p>",

Hidden Power Ice is an option to compress the means to hit both Ground- and Grass-types into a single moveslot and is notably Flaaffy's strongest option against Tropius, even OHKOing some variants. However, Hidden Power Grass is Flaaffy's only means to hit Chinchou, and thus it's very difficult to drop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Due to Flaaffy's low physical bulk, Ground-types such as Cubone can easily OHKO it and it usually fails to OHKO them first.

Flaaffy has significant competition with Delcatty in this role, though Flaaffy justifies its use with its solid offensive presence, making it effective at taking on some physical walls and Electic-weak foes such as Koffing, Clamperl, and Noctowl. While Flaaffy can be used to defensively check some foes such as Elekid and Koffing, it is quite frail and thus should generally avoid taking hits; as a result, bulky teammates such as Tropius, Mightyena, and Gloom make great partners. Bulky attackers such as Tropius and Castform can also form potent offensive cores with Flaafy, with them able to KO or status each other's checks. Flaafy can't break through some special walls such as Porygon, making wallbreakers such as Choice Band Aipom useful partners. Flaaffy has the tendency to get worn down quickly due to its lack of reliable recovery, making Wish users such as Delcatty and Drowzee good teammates on more defensive teams.

A neutrality to Electric and missing STAB on Earthquake can be a significant downside when considering it over Graveler and other Rock-types like Pupitar, but a wider movepool, including access to both Explosion and Focus Punch, ensures it has a place on teams needing a solid Rock-type that doesn't just cave in to the abundance of Grass- and Water-types in the tier.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sudowoodo has a surprisingly large movepool, but like most Pokemon in NU, there's little reason to use most of it. An Endure + Salac Berry + Flail set can hit like a truck, but Sudowoodo is excruciatingly slow; although with max Speed EVs, +1, and a Jolly nature it does outspeed max Speed Adamant Hitmonchan. Unfortunately, it loses out to anything faster than Hitmonchan. A more defensive RestTalk set is definitely viable; however, it's largely outclassed by Relicanth, which is more physically bulky and sports a slightly more useful defensive typing.</p> <p>As for single move options, Rock Tomb can allow Sudowoodo to get the jump on some defensive Pokemon like Kecleon. Block can prevent an Explosion target from escaping if the opponent predicts wrong. Finally, Calm Mind is an interesting option to allow Sudowoodo to tank a super effective Water- or Grass-type attack and blow the target up with Explosion. Please don't try to sweep with Calm Mind, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best initial switch-ins to Sudowoodo are defensive Grass-types, particularly Tangela, as they take little damage from Rock Slide, resist Earthquake, and can outspeed and threaten it with their STAB moves. Defensive Water-types, particularly Whiscash because it resists Rock Slide, are other good initial switch-ins. Both types really need to be wary of Explosion, however. Other Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-types are good switch-ins as well, as the former resist Sudowoodo's STAB moves and the latter two resist Explosion; good examples being Graveler, Relicanth, and Mawile. However, they all need to watch out for Focus Punch and Earthquake. Hitmonchan also resists Rock Slide and can take Sudowoodo out with Sky Uppercut. Finally, Haunter and Sableye get a special mention for being immune to Explosion and Focus Punch, and Haunter is even immune to Earthquake.</p>",

          "description": "<p>The good thing about Sudowoodo when choosing it as a Choice Band user is that it is quite flexible in what it can do. Rock Slide and Hidden Power Rock are the STAB move options; the choice comes down to whether you want perfect accuracy in Hidden Power Rock or a bit more power in Rock Slide. Earthquake pairs perfectly with its Rock-type STAB move to form near-perfect neutral coverage. Focus Punch can be used in the third slot to annihilate the foe if a switch can be predicted, but it can be kind of hard to use correctly. This makes Brick Break a decent alternative that still hits the defensive Normal-types in the tier harder than Sudowoodo's other moves. The last slot is dedicated to Sudowoodo's Normal move of choice. Explosion can take out nearly any Pokemon in the tier when backed by Choice Band, and in fact it is the strongest unboosted attack in the tier. Alternatively, Double-Edge is a fantastic safety move that can be great for when the opponent has both Pelipper and Hitmonchan waiting in the wings and you're not sure which they'll go to, and it doesn't have any recoil thanks to Rock Head.</p> <p>Sudowoodo is very slow, so simply maxing out HP and Attack is generally the best thing to do when using it. Running enough Speed to outpace Kecleon, Lairon, and Graveler is an option, but there's ultimately not much use in doing so, as the former two don't necessarily threaten Sudowoodo and the latter wins regardless. However, a couple EVs can be transferred from HP to Speed to make sure Sudowoodo can outpace Magcargo and Lickitung.</p> <p>There's not a lot of other options that can really find a spot on this set, since Sudowoodo gets such good coverage with the moves provided; however, Hidden Power Ghost can be used for a better hit on Haunter and Chimecho. This set works well as a lead for offensive teams that have a reliable answer to Hitmonchan, as it easily OHKOes common leads like Glalie, Venomoth, Flareon, and Mawile. Because Sudowoodo is so slow, it's easily revenge killed even by most defensive Pokemon running 0 Speed, so it needs some defensive support to work properly. Defensive Grass-types in particular have an easy time with Sudowoodo, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Pidgeot good teammates. Grass-types of your own make good teammates to pair with Sudowoodo, as they can switch into the multitude of Water-types in the tier, and Sudowoodo has an easy time with the aforementioned Flying-types to protect them. Specially defensive Normal-types like Lickitung and Kecleon make for great team choices to form a good defensive core with Sudowoodo. Finally, Chimecho and Haunter are good teammates to check Hitmonchan, as it can otherwise easily switch into Rock Slide and blow Sudowoodo away with its Sky Uppercut.</p>"

        "SubPunch": {
          "description": "<p>This set takes a more conservative approach to playing with Sudowoodo, taking advantage of the switches it causes to allow it to choose the correct move against the incoming Pokemon. Focus Punch pairs naturally well with Substitute, providing an extremely strong attack with good coverage when paired alongside Sudowoodo's Rock-type STAB move. The last slot depends on how you want to use Sudowoodo. With Explosion, Sudowoodo becomes a fantastic lure to be able to take out specific Pokemon with a level of certainty from behind a Substitute, particularly the Grass- and Water-types likely to switch into it. However, if you want Sudowoodo to stick around, Earthquake completes Sudowoodo's fantastic coverage and gives it a reliable tool for taking out Steel-types like Mawile.</p> <p>Running more Speed on this set has merit, as getting a Substitute up before a defensive Pokemon like Sableye or Kecleon can use Toxic is fantastic. How much Speed is up to you, but in doing so be aware that Sudowoodo's bulk drops significantly the more HP you take away due to its low base HP.</p> <p>This set tends to cause a lot of switches, making Spikes phenomenally useful, which also means Glalie and Roselia are good teammates. As Sudowoodo will largely be picking and choosing its target with Explosion on this set, if you choose to use it, having a Pokemon that thrives with the removal of the opponent's bulky Water- or Grass-type is highly recommended. Examples include special attacking Flareon or Plusle, depending on your target. Sudowoodo still easily counters most Flying- and Normal-types with this set, making it a good defensive teammate for Pokemon like offensive Grass-types and special walls like Kecleon. Finally, defensive Grass-types, namely Tangela, have an easy time countering this set, even with the threat of Focus Punch, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Pidgeot good teammates.</p>"

Aipom has a variety of utility options such as Taunt, Toxic, and Thunder Wave, but Aipom's its frailty makes it outclassed at using these moves. Shadow Ball provides Aipom with the means to threaten Shuppet, but its rarity makes Shadow Ball generally not worth using.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Corsola and the rare Lileep take minimal damage from Aipom's STAB moves, aren't 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Brick Break, and can heal off damage with Recover, making them Aipom's hardest check. Rhyhorn lacks reliable recovery, but it can easily tank Aipom's STAB moves and threaten it and its team with heavy damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: While they are usually OHKOed back, faster foes such as Abra and Ponyta can easily revenge kill Aipom after it has taken the smallest amount of chip damage. Weather sweepers, such as Gloom, can easily OHKO Aipom when their favored weather is active, though they usually take heavy damage or are OHKOed outright by Aipom's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Shuppet</strong>: Since Aipom usually only runs Normal- and Fighting-type attacking moves, it cannot damage Shuppet at all.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: With its resistance to Normal, Magnemite can tank Aipom's STAB moves and threaten it and its team with heavy damage and status, though it cannot switch into even resisted Choice Band-boosted Normal-type attacks and must be wary of Aipom's Fighting-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Tropius</strong>: Offensive variants of Tropius can easily tank even a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge and threaten heavy damage in return, notably with Tropius able to set up sun to outspeed Aipom next turn. Defensive variants of Tropius are bulky enough to not even be 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge, letting it wall Aipom.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Being burned completely ruins Aipom, preventing it from meaningfully damaging most foes. Paralysis is similar, making Aipom easy to KO due to its frailty. While Toxic doesn't immediately stop Aipom, it tends to be worn down very quickly by poison damage and Double-Edge recoil.</p>",

Brick Break targets Rock-types such as Corsola and Rhyhorn, as well as hitting Magnemite. Baton Pass lets Aipom pivot out, easing prediction against foes likely to switch out against it. Return provides a powerful hit without costing Aipom's HP, but its lower power matters in some matchups, such as it failing to 2HKO physically bulky variants of Gloom and Koffing. Both of Aipom's abilities are useless; it does not matter which is chosen.</p> <p>Aipom best fits on offensive and balance teams looking for a potent wallbreaker, something helped by the lack of viable Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves. The ability to remove physical and special walls and tanks such as Koffing, Noctowl, and Flaaffy makes it a great partner for offensive teammates such as Elekid, Ponyta, and Gloom. Calm Mind Corsola is Aipom's hardest counter, taking minimal damage from Double-Edge and failing to be 2HKOed by Brick Break. Grass-types such as Tropius and Gloom can break through Corsola before it accumulates too many boosts, though they must watch out for Ice Beam. Powerful wallbreakers such as Clamperl and Cubone can break through Aipom's defensive checks like Corsola, Rhyhorn, and Lileep, while it in return provides them with the means to switch in with Baton Pass. Toxic users such as Porygon can also cripple these foes, limiting their ability to check Aipom. Aipom struggles with faster Pokemon such as Ponyta and Abra, making bulky Pokemon such as Mightyena and Tropius good teammates.

Brick Break lacks Double-Edge's recoil as a coverage move for Pokemon that resist Normal like Lileep, Magnemite, and Rhyhorn, though Double-Edge is still stronger against most of them, including Anorith. Return trades Double-Edge's recoil drawback for lower power, though this is helpful to Aipom given its lack of defensive utility and longevity. Focus Punch can catch Corsola and other Pokemon weak to Fighting like Mightyena and Lileep trying to switch into Aipom, dealing way more damage than Double-Edge or Brick Break despite the riskiness of using it. Baton Pass enables Aipom to be an offensive pivot, taking advantage of switch-ins to switch to an appropriate teammate and letting Aipom escape bad matchups against defensive Pokemon such as Corsola. A Silk Scarf maximizes the power of Aipom's STAB moves and lacks the drawbacks of locking in that Choice Band inflicts.</p> <p>All-out Attacker Aipom fits more offensive teams as a cleaner thanks to its high Speed, and its utility as a revenge killer is also appreciated by bulkier teams. Wallbreakers like Seaking, Quilava, and Ponyta can soften up teams for Aipom to clean up while checking opposing Ponyta. Choice Band wallbreakers such as Doduo, Volbeat, and Meditite can respectively break down physically defensive Pokemon such as Koffing, Mightyena, and Corsola for Aipom. Pokemon that can check or counter Koffing such as Tentacool, Drowzee, and Dustox are helpful teammates for Aipom due to it struggling to overcome Koffing on its own. Physically defensive Gloom and Tropius are a pain for Aipom to break without support, so it appreciates help from partners like Koffing and Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava to neutralize them. Aipom appreciates bulkier partners that can check the few Pokemon faster than it; Castform and Wartortle can handle Ponyta, Mightyena and Porygon check Abra, and Chinchou and Delcatty answer Elekid. Aipom especially struggles to break Corsola, so it appreciates checks to it such as Flaaffy and Gloom.

Hidden Power Fire prevents Pokemon such as Bayleef, other Sunflora, or Magnemite from walling Sunflora. It's also boosted by Sunny Day allowing Sunflora to almost always 2HKO Dustox.

There are also certain physically defensive walls that Yanma cannot break even at +1, such as Relicanth, Torkoal, and Sableye. Lastly, although they are few and far between, Pokemon such as Golbat and Wailord can phaze Yanma with Whirlwind.</p>",

        "Substitute + Reversal": {
          "description": "<p>Substitute shields Yanma from status and, more importantly, cuts down its HP by 25%, allowing it to accumulate several Speed boosts as it brings itself to 1 HP for maximum Reversal Base Power and the activation of its Liechi Berry. Reversal is Yanma's most spammable move once it gets down to 1 HP, OHKOing a multitude of Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Flareon, and Mawile. Hidden Power Flying provides STAB and synergizes well with Reversal, hitting Bug- and Poison-types such as opposing Yanma, Venomoth, and Roselia super effectively. Protect ensures that Yanma's Speed Boost activates before attempting a sweep, eliminating the majority of the risk associated with utilizing other Endure and Substitute + Reversal Pokemon, which can be outsped by the opposition.</p> <p>An Adamant nature alongside maximum Attack and Speed EVs gives Yanma the best opportunity to sweep late-game. Because Yanma will almost always use Protect turn one, it's more advantageous to utilize an Adamant nature over a Jolly one. Unless Yanma can be guaranteed to KO the opposing Pokemon, using Substitute until it's at 1 HP is by far Yanma's safest play. It's important to utilize the lack of a Team Preview to your advantage by not bringing Yanma in until late-game when it has the greatest chance of sweeping. Specially attacking teammates such as Huntail and Haunter that can break down physical walls such as Relicanth, Torkoal, Sableye, and Shuckle all help Yanma sweep late-game by removing some of its greatest checks. Spikes support is important for Yanma, as all of its best checks are grounded, and Yanma needs help getting KOs considering its low Attack. Roselia is the most reliable setter available, as it is the bulkiest and has access to reliable recovery, although Glalie and Cacturne work fine too. Keep in mind that Yanma, Roselia, Cacturne, and Glalie all share a common weakness in Fire and that they will need proper team support to help cover these extra weaknesses.</p>"

  "Espeon": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>I can't stress enough how much Espeon does not have to be a special sweeper just because of its high Special Attack and Speed stats. Assuming this does a great disservice to the sexiness that is Calm Mind and Baton Pass, and Espeon can arguably pull this combination off the best, being only weak to Dark attacks specially. I honestly think that nothing can really \"counter\" EspyJump straight up, with Baton Pass and great Speed, besides Dugtrio if you don't have a Substitute up and are at full or near-full HP (Adamant Dugtrio does a maximum of 79% damage with Earthquake).</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Water can go over Baton Pass if you want a chance to take down some common Pokemon that think they've got Espeon in the bag: Metagross, Tyranitar, and Houndoom. You can also use Morning Sun for more staying power. Bite is an option for other Psychic-types but I wouldn't recommend it, because the more powerful Hidden Power Dark would be better since the Pokemon that are weak to Dark attacks, Psychics and Ghosts, are all usually faster than Espeon (read: Alakazam, Gengar, Starmie), so you won't be flinching the Pokemon that Bite is super effective against. Charm is there for annoyance, although it is still a move better suited for a Pokemon that is designed to actually take physical blows, like Umbreon. The same goes for Wish, really. Reflect can let Espeon keep up a Substitute against both physical and special attacks, but the only thing you could really drop for that is Psychic, which is just going to make life easier for phazers like Skarmory.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>EspyJump, surprising as it may seem, is a special tank. It is there to lull special attackers into a false sense of security, and then belie its charming exterior by setting up until your opponent realizes you've got three Calm Minds and a Substitute and there's no way that they can break your Substitutes efficiently. For this reason, I prescribe a Timid nature, putting 200 EVs in HP for 321, 236 in SpD for 285 and 72 in Speed for 301. This used to be 296 Speed because when I devised EspyJump in 2004, Choice Band Salamence and its 299 Speed had yet to be created; rather, Heracross and its max-295 speed was the thing to beat. 321 HP is used over 320, as this allows for an extra Substitute, since it's conceivable that Espeon takes no direct damage, thanks to Calm Mind and Substitute blocking attacks, especially if someone attempts to status Espeon, giving you a free turn. Remember, Espeon is not Alakazam, and it doesn't need to outspeed that much, especially if you have a Substitute up and can Baton Pass your Calm Minds to an appropriate teammate anyway before threats like Tauros and Slaking can get you.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Aerodactyl sacrifice and Dugtrio combo can counter this and like 90% of the things in the game, but I'll mention it again. The aforementioned Metagross, Tyranitar, and Houndoom are all effective counters to EspyJump somewhat, as is Claydol (they will all fall to Hidden Power Fire/Water though), but that is what Baton Pass is for, being faster than all of those Pokemon save Houndoom, whose attack you should be protected against via Substitute or Calm Mind anyway. Tyranitar messes with EspyJump the most, its Sand Stream negating the Leftovers that are integral to its efficacy. And of course I can't forget the obligatory Blissey mention, but again, Baton Pass (to a CursePert for example) makes the strategy behind EspyJump virtually uncounterable. Snorlax also forces a Baton Pass, and Skarmory and Suicune will Roar you the hell out if you don't attack them soon enough, and they of course aren't OHKOed anyway. Again, I feel that nothing can really be a \"counter\" to EspyJump unless it manages to phaze it, which Skarmory and a Roaring Suicune can do, which is why you shouldn't always just sit there and set up. If you're worried about getting Roared out, jack up its Special Attack--I'm an extremist and I know that putting absolutely no EVs into a Special Attack is so sexy (394 highest) is somewhat of a crime.</p> <h3>Jumpman16's Final Thoughts</h3> <p>Oh EspyJump, you are my first love. This Pokemon has no business being used so little, and I feel that it is often overlooked because most players think that it is just a weaker version of Alakazam. Espeon was just about my favorite Pokemon in GS because of its looks, and with what I learned it can do in Advance play my love for it just skyrocketed. It is an awesome Pokemon, and I suggest you all give it a try.</p>",
      "sets": {"EspyJump": {"description": "<p>Baton Pass is your friend. So is Calm Mind. You are encouraged to have a good special recipient of EspyJump's Calm Minds, though the Special Defense boost is always welcomed. You can bring it out against a non-STAB-boosted special attack as well, and then use your head and try to outpredict your opponent's status or attacking attempts. And honestly, I'm trying to think of a better Celebi counter than EspyJump, and I really can't. If you manage to status some of your opponent's Pokemon and Celebi pops out, you should immediately be salivating at your keyboard. The predictable Heal Bell, and the high probability that Espeon's \"nemesis\" Blissey is not also being used by your opponent, gives you a great opportunity to set EspyJump up if you play it smart, and Substitute regardless of whether they Leech Seed or switch.</p>"}}

It can make a great wall as well as a good supporter, and contributes Mean Look, Wish, Charm, and good Substitutes to a Baton Pass chain. It might open your team up to powerful hits such as Heracross's Megahorn and Focus Punch, though, so be careful. Pairing it with Dugtrio and using Baton Pass the first turn Umbreon is out is a good way to quickly patch up this weakness, however.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Umbreon can soften up opponents with Charm and Tickle for a teammate to sweep. It can also run Charm along with Wish to counter Curse users pretty easily. Torment can further aggravate opponents and Pursuit can be used as an offensive option, but these are generally not recommended due to their unreliability. Umbreon can also use Snatch with Baton Pass to catch boosts such as Dragon Dance and Curse as it is typically setup bait. Psychic can hurt common switch-ins such as Gengar and Heracross, but it has little other use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Jolteon, Espeon, Mr. Mime, and other fast Substitute + Baton Pass users are Umbreon's best checks, while Taunt users such as Gyarados, Gengar, and Houndoom can prevent Umbreon from doing anything. If Umbreon doesn't invest in Speed, Taunt + Dragon Dance Tyranitar can set up on it too. Medicham, Primeape, Breloom, Hariyama, and Heracross can use their STAB Fighting- or Bug-type moves to stop Umbreon, and the Guts users among them love Toxic as well.</p>",

Wish is better if you can use it with proper prediction, especially as it can potentially heal a teammate, but Moonlight's instant healing is also highly useful.

  "Murkrow": {
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Murkrow is one of the most simple, yet one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the NU metagame. An extremely high Speed stat, STAB Drill Peck, and really high Attack when combined with a Choice Band give it an incredible offensive presence on the battlefield. While it's extremely similar to Pidgeot, which even boasts the same Speed stat, Murkrow has a slightly better typing, ability, and overall coverage than its brother-in-wings. Insomnia makes Murkrow a golden answer to a majority of the Grass-types in the tier (though it needs to be really wary of Stun Spore), and its Dark typing means it can get a free switch into Chimecho's STAB Psychic and threaten it back with Shadow Ball. While it is much, much frailer than Pidgeot, and its STAB Drill Peck is leagues weaker than Pidgeot's Double-Edge, there's still very little risk to using Murkrow. Quoth the raven: \"your walls will be nevermore.\"</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There's a lot Murkrow \"can\" do but not a lot it \"should\" do. Losing the power of Choice Band is almost sickening, but forgoing it and replacing Double-Edge with Substitute and Choice Band with Liechi Berry is an option, and doing so can help when you're unsure of what your opponent will do next while protecting Murkrow from status from defensive teams. Thunder Wave can cripple a switch-in, but most Pokemon that will be switching into Murkrow are super slow already. Perish trapping the opposing Pokemon is an option, but Murkrow hardly lacks the bulk to effectively pull this off in any capacity. Finally, Calm Mind is there, but Murkrow's strongest STAB move, Feint Attack, is horribly weak even at +1, and Murkrow has no coverage other than Hidden Power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The number one counter to Murkrow is defensive Mawile. Intimidate removes Hidden Power Ground as an effective answer to it, and in return, Mawile can slap Murkrow around with Hidden Power Steel or use Murkrow as setup bait. Defensive Relicanth is a close second, though it fears Hidden Power Grass more than it would like. That said, nothing else from Murkrow is going to leave a lasting scratch on it. Other Steel- and Rock-types, such as Metang, Lairon, Graveler, and Sudowoodo, are great answers to Murkrow, though they all have to be more wary about Hidden Power Ground, especially if Spikes are on their side of the field.</p> <p>Apart from those that resist Drill Peck, generally physically bulky Pokemon like Piloswine can tank an attack and easily KO Murkrow back; other examples of which include Whiscash, Wailord, Dewgong, and Swalot. Plusle and Haunter cannot switch into Murkrow safely, but they outspeed Murkrow and easily OHKO it with Thunderbolt, and Raticate does the same with Double-Edge.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Murkrow's STAB Drill Peck is, undeniably, one of the best moves in a tier where Hitmonchan, Grass-types, and Bug-types abound. What's more, it's powerful enough to 2HKO 252 HP Piloswine and OHKO Raticate when boosted by a Choice Band, indicating its pure unadulterated power. Hidden Power Ground takes out the Rock- and Steel-types bold enough to try stepping into the path of Murkrow's Drill Peck, easily 2HKOing Sudowoodo, Lairon, Metang, and Graveler after a layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Ground is preferred to Hidden Power Fighting for its super effective hit on Poison-types, particularly Swalot, but Hidden Power Fighting offers a super effective hit on Normal-types and doesn't let the multitude of Ground-immune Pokemon switch in for free. Shadow Ball and Double-Edge are largely filler but can be used as safety moves when you're unsure of which way your opponent is going to go. Shadow Ball is particularly nice for its super effective hit on Chimecho and neutral hit on Rock-types.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is absolutely needed to not only get the Speed tie with other Murkrow and Pidgeot but also outspeed the base 90 Speed tier, which notably includes Venomoth and Vigoroth. Dropping down to Adamant gives Murkrow more power, but losing those Speed ties and getting outsped by positive-natured base 80s like Glalie is a death wish. Sharp Beak can be used to bluff a Choice Band while keeping high power on Drill Peck and gaining the ability to switch moves, although the drop in power on its other moves is super noticeable. There are only two notable move changes to consider on this set. The first is replacing Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting with Hidden Power Grass and using a Naughty nature, as doing so gives Murkrow an easy way to blow past its biggest nemesis in Relicanth along with Graveler and Whiscash. Hidden Power Ground will be better most times, however, particularly against the likes of Mawile and the other Steel-types. The second is Pursuit, which can be used effectively in the last moveslot over Double-Edge when you know your opponent is going to switch, in particular being a nice tool for Chimecho; just be sure to change Murkrow's nature to Naughty when doing so. Pursuit is a terrible move to be locked into, though, so it's recommended to only use it with Sharp Beak.</p> <p>Spikes support is incredible with this set, as it pushes a ton of Pokemon into 2HKO range, particularly the Rock- and Steel-types weak to Hidden Power Ground, and the only Pokemon that can really tank attacks from Murkrow are grounded (Pelipper being about the only exception). Due to this, Glalie and Cacturne make exceptional offensive Spikes partners to use with Murkrow, and both have an easy time OHKOing the Rock-types that can withstand Murkrow's attacks.</p> <p>Murkrow is a great counter to the defensive Grass-types in the tier and a great check to the offensive ones, meaning Rock- and Water-types such as Sudowoodo and Seadra appreciate having Murkrow as an offensive teammate to eliminate them. Murkrow also generally has an easy time with Chimecho, if it avoids Hidden Power Electric anyway, meaning Hitmonchan likes having Murkrow as a teammate too. Loading on Choice Band users on your team is a good strategy when using Murkrow, as very little in the tier can take on that kind of onslaught, particularly if Murkrow is used with its partner in crime Pidgeot.</p> <p>Defensive Relicanth and Mawile are probably the best switch-ins to Murkrow, with the former only really fearing Hidden Power Grass and the latter weakening Murkrow with Intimidate. Due to this, Murkrow absolutely needs teammates that can reliably switch into these Pokemon and try to eliminate them. If your prediction is good, Diglett is an almost surefire way of trapping and getting rid of Mawile. Otherwise, a Grass-type like Tangela has a very easy time with Relicanth and other Rock-types, while Fire-types like Torkoal can switch into Mawile with impunity and force it out with Fire Blast. Plusle and Haunter have an easy time revenge killing Murkrow, so bringing something to absorb Electric attacks is a good idea; Grass- and Ground-types being good general partners to do so.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Slowking is one of UU's premier Calm Mind sweepers and bulky Water-types. Slowking can be immediately threatening even with a single boost thanks to its nearly unresisted dual STAB combination. Its huge bulk allows for ample setup opportunities against the tier's numerous Water- and Ground-types such as Omastar, Tentacruel, and Gligar, with most special coverage options bouncing off of it. This is complemented nicely by Rest, which allows Slowking to continue its sweep and remain threatening for the long haul. Slowking can be very hard to KO without enough offensive pressure, allowing it to easily punish most bulky builds that aim to take the game slower, and it is a great fit on bulky balance and offense teams that can open up opportunities for Slowking to wreak havoc.</p> <p>Despite its great bulk and defensive typing, Slowking is very slow and can get easily overwhelmed by offensive pressure and forced into using Rest early, something further compounded by Spikes, which makes it difficult for it to switch in. Slowking's reliance on Rest for recovery is exploitable through lost momentum, especially by sweepers that can win the game on the spot, such as Swords Dance Scyther. Slowking is also very susceptible to critical hits, as only one can put it out of commission as it's getting pressured because it has a hard time finding another opportunity to use Rest.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave is useful for turning the tides on switch-ins like Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Electabuzz and allows for earlier opportunities to set up or use Rest. Dropping Psychic for Thunder Wave is useful on paralysis spam structures, though dropping Psychic will hurt Slowking's ability to hit other Water-types and Vileplume. Dropping Rest for Thunder Wave is situationally useful on hyper offensive structures where Slowking's bulky setup sweeper nature trades longevity for speed control, but it then loses out on crucial recovery to sustain itself through its sweep. A Psychic + Calm Mind + RestTalk set reduces Slowking's coverage, but it allows Slowking to maintain itself as an offensive threat while asleep and boost more freely without losing any momentum.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Offensive variants of Kangaskhan can muscle through Slowking's physical bulk and prevent it from Rest looping with Double-Edge being a 3HKO. Specially defensive variants also work well in a pinch, forcing Slowking into a bad spot with Toxic and having reliable ways to recover off the damage Slowking deals with Wish and Early Bird Rest. Roar variants of Kangaskhan can hard stop Slowking's sweep, forcing it out of its Calm Mind boosts. However, Slowking can take advantage of Kangaskhan's Rest turns by setting up and hitting back hard with a boosted Surf.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir pose a dangerous threat to Slowking, smashing through it with super effective STAB moves. Choice Band Scyther has a lot of immediate power with Hidden Power Bug or Silver Wind, KOing even from 60% and potentially OHKOing in Swarm range. Although Swords Dance Scyther and non-Adamant Pinsir need to set up to 2HKO Slowking, they can use Slowking's Rest turns to boost and threaten to sweep. Both Pokemon can hit Slowking very hard, but they get hit hard in return if they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Ampharos, Lanturn, and Electabuzz are great at handling Slowking, since their STAB Thunderbolts are mostly unperturbed by Special Defense boosts and prevent Slowking from Rest looping. However, if they have taken prior chip damage, Slowking can occasionally take the trade to KO them after Calm Mind, and the faster Electric-types have trouble directly switching into its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon with Roar such as Altaria, Walrein, Blastoise, and occasionally Kangaskhan can tank any boosted attacks and force Slowking out, making Slowking start back at square one on its sweep and potentially forcing it to switch in with Spikes up. If Slowking is low without using Rest, it's very hard to find an opportunity to recover and Slowking's team becomes on the back foot. However, some of these Pokemon usually don't make much progress of their own on Slowking one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore users like Walrein, Cacturne, Mr. Mime, and Raichu can lock Slowking into Calm Mind, hard stopping its sweep and preventing it from healing off damage while they use the free turns to pressure its team. Some of these Pokemon need a read on Calm Mind, as they don't comfortably switch into Slowking's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: An Explosion user such as Solrock, Electrode, Muk, or Glalie can stop Slowking's sweep by trading with it. This often opens up a gateway for a Slowking-weak Pokemon like Arcanine or Gligar to safely clean.</p>",

Its naturally high special bulk coupled with greatly invested physical bulk and a lack of common physical weaknesses means Slowking can survive numerous uses of STAB Earthquake, Hidden Power Electric, and Hidden Power Grass thrown its way, with the latter two doing little damage at +1 Special Defense. Psychic allows Slowking to hit Water- and Grass-types such as Tentacruel and Vileplume. Rest gives Slowking longevity to keep sweeping the opposing team and to offset the damage it takes from a multitude of attacks, Spikes, and Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes are the bane of Slowking, so a Rapid Spin user such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, or Hitmontop is mandatory with it, allowing for safer switches on Pokemon like Gligar and Arcanine. A cleric such as Ampharos, Vileplume, or Altaria can wake up Slowking after it uses Rest, letting it hit the field again for another Calm Mind-boosted assault. Kangaskhan provides the team another special sponge for opposing Water- and Electric-types, and it can pass a Wish to Slowking to keep it healthy when needing to switch into certain threats with Spikes up or if it took prior chip damage. Since Choice Band Scyther is an immediate threat to Slowking, Pokemon that can check it such as Granbull, Arcanine, and Gligar are good partners, establishing their own offense that complements Slowking by cleaning up late-game. Pokemon that can check Electric-types such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, Cradily, and Nidoqueen can passively damage or wallbreak through them to enable Slowking to sweep and be not as easily forced out.</p>"

Its coveted Ghost typing accompanied by Levitate give it a very valuable defensive niche by being immune to Spikes and checking physical attackers such as Gligar and Scyther, as well as Kangaskhan, Granbull, and Nidoqueen lacking Shadow Ball. Its good base Special Defense also lets it check Tentacruel and Blastoise to spinblock them more reliably than the other Ghost-types, Haunter and Sableye. Misdreavus also provides other methods of defensive support with tools like Thunder Wave, Pain Split, and Perish Song, which makes it a solid stopgap to most forms of offense.</p> <p>However, Misdreavus's defensive capabilities are also met with having issues with passivity. Its main way of dealing damage comes from relying on Spikes, Toxic, and hitting super effectively, as its neutral damage is very pitiful. Misdreavus also struggles at taking hits from stronger opponents that hit it neutrally due to its low base HP, which harms its matchups against Pokemon like Arcanine and Solrock. It also means untimely critical hits are annoying as Misdreavus tries to wall Tentacruel and Blastoise. While Misdreavus can situationally check Kangaskhan by virtue of PP stalling, the matchup is flipped if Kangaskhan is running Shadow Ball, and the same applies to other Pokemon Misdreavus would like to consistently check such as Granbull and Nidoqueen, forcing it to scout their coverage.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Misdreavus can run Mean Look and Perish Song over its standard attacks as a surprise way to make progress by removing bulky targets that cannot threaten it such as Kangaskhan without Shadow Ball that would otherwise think it wins through walling Misdreavus. Protect can also be ran over a status move on this set to guard itself against stray attacks while the Perish Song counter goes down and gain more Leftovers recovery. Misdreavus can run an Imprison-focused set with Imprison, Shadow Ball, Toxic, and Rest to be able to stonewall every Kangaskhan variant once it sets up Imprison, denying Kangaskhan from using Rest to cure itself from Toxic. This also applies to other Pokemon Misdreavus can wall that rely on Shadow Ball to hit it such as Granbull and Nidoqueen. However, this set isn't foolproof to beat Kangaskhan, as it still doesn't like switching into Shadow Ball, and it gets outsped by Jolly variants before it can use Imprison. Additionally, its good matchup into Kangaskhan is offset by its terrible matchups into everything else, including Scyther and Gligar, as well as foes it is meant to spinblock. Misdreavus can go the offensive route with a Substitute + Calm Mind set to avoid being statused by Kangaskhan's Toxic and using it as setup fodder, but Misdreavus's damage is still extremely weak, even with boosts, compared to other Calm Mind sweepers and is less consistent than standard defensive sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Despite its immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type moves and resilience against Toxic when backed by cleric support, Misdreavus has issues into Shadow Ball variants of Kangaskhan that hit it meaningfully, forcing it into a defensive position while it struggles to break Kangaskhan by itself. Misdreavus also is extremely vulnerable to SubPunch Kangaskhan, as it can't rely on walling Kangaskhan with status and Pain Split and can't break Kangaskhan's Substitute in one hit, letting Kangaskhan freely pressure it back with a strong Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ampharos</strong>: Ampharos isn't damaged meaningfully by Misdreavus while also being able to cure itself and its teammates from status Misdreavus throws out with Heal Bell, and it can retaliate with a strong Thunderbolt that can break past a potential Rest cycle.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Coverage</strong>: While Misdreavus can wall certain physical attackers, some of them can use Ghost-type coverage for Misdreavus that can pressure it in the forms of Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Ghost. Kangaskhan, Granbull, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Hitmontop, Hitmonlee, and certain Swords Dance Tentacruel variants are all able to threaten Misdreavus and prevent it from walling them if they run Ghost-type coverage moves. This is especially important for Hitmontop, which Misdreavus would be able to consistently spinblock otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Without Perish Song, Misdreavus struggles against Calm Mind users even when it can hit them super effectively. They can also be apt at dodging status, as Slowking and Xatu use Rest, Grumpig and Lunatone can run Substitute, and Golduck can run Lum Berry. After the Calm Mind users have had opportunities to boost, Misdreavus struggles to take their hits and deal any meaningful damage back.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks</strong>: Although Misdreavus is formidable at taking weaker special attacks from the likes of Tentacruel and Blastoise, it struggles to take stronger hits that can overwhelm it quickly from the likes of Arcanine, Rain Dance Omastar, and offensive Lapras.</p>",

        "Defensive Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With a defensive set, Misdreavus does well at taking hits from and pestering common offensive Pokemon, such as Scyther and Gligar, as well as Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel to keep Spikes on the opposing side of the field. Since Misdreavus tends to check Pokemon that are Spikes-immune, it can force Spikes damage onto many of its switch-ins.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Psychic are relatively interchangeable, as both can hit Tentacruel, and Hidden Power Ice is needed if Misdreavus is used to check Gligar. Thunderbolt is Misdreavus's strongest neutral attack with PP advantages over Psychic in longer battles, and it allows Misdreavus to provide more immediate damage onto bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Omastar, and Feraligatr. Thunderbolt is also able to threaten Scyther with a 2HKO, which avoids putting it in Swarm range unlike Hidden Power Ice and is safer against Swords Dance variants with Lum Berry or Substitute. Psychic can be used for a super effective hit into Hitmontop to apply pressure back while it is using Hidden Power Ghost, and it's Misdreavus's best move into Kangaskhan through Special Defense drops that can force it out and rack up more Spikes damage on the opposing team. However, it leaves Misdreavus unable to meaningfully damage Blastoise and has worse PP than Thunderbolt. Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Gligar and can 3HKO Altaria at minimum depending on what spread it's running. If Misdreavus doesn't need to be used as a Gligar check, Misdreavus can run both Thunderbolt and Psychic together to have better neutral coverage and threaten every spinner. Thunder Wave is used to hinder the Speed of Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Arcanine, Tentacruel, and Scyther to make them less effective at hitting Misdreavus, letting Misdreavus use Pain Split before they attack and potentially annoying them with full paralysis. Toxic can be used instead to put bulky Pokemon like Blastoise, Lanturn, and Cradily on a timer. Pain Split is a form of instant recovery and synergizes well with Misdreavus's low base HP to trade well with Kangaskhan. Rest is an alternative option to cure status while healing Misdreavus back to full health and helps in PP stall wars against Kangaskhan. Perish Song can be used alongside Hidden Power Ice to phaze bulky setup sweepers and force switches to rack up more Spikes damage.</p> <p>Maximum HP and 84 Defense EVs allow Misdreavus to live Swords Dance Scyther's +2 Hidden Power Flying from full health. The rest is put into Special Defense in order to spinblock Tentacruel better. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to take physical attacks like Hitmontop's Hidden Power Ghost better while still dodging a 3HKO from Tentacruel's Surf. 52 Special Attack EVs can be used to guarantee a consistent OHKO on Gligar with Hidden Power Ice, although it usually isn't worth sacrificing defensive EVs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order for Misdreavus's team to be effective at making progress, it is best paired with Spikes that it can uphold by spinblocking common spinners. Omastar is a great candidate to set Spikes, as its massive Defense allows it multiple opportunities to come in mid-game to lay Spikes against Kangaskhan, Scyther, Solrock, and Granbull, meaning Misdreavus doesn't have to be a sole check to these Pokemon. Misdreavus is also a cornerstone of Spikes+paralysis spam teams, as its ability to keep Spikes on the field combined with Thunder Wave enables slow but dangerous wallbreakers such as Choice Band Solrock and Choice Band Golem. On these teams, Misdreavus is usually paired with Spikers such as bulky Qwilfish or Roselia, which can paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore as well as providing other means of team support such as Self-Destruct and Aromatherapy. Misdreavus also pairs well with wallbreakers and late-game cleaners to provide a much-needed source of offense that takes advantage of Spikes chip on bulky foes. Pokemon like Arcanine, Feraligatr, Nidoqueen, Grumpig, and Swords Dance Tentacruel are all apt wallbreakers with Spikes that can break open holes for late-game cleaners like Choice Band Scyther to clean up.</p> <p>Since Misdreavus is worn down by status and using Rest makes it more passive, it appreciates being paired with a cleric such as Ampharos, Vileplume, and Lapras. Ampharos and Vileplume especially appreciate Misdreavus's ability to check Gligar. Defensive Kangaskhan is able to provide Misdreavus with Wish support so it isn't pressured as much to use Pain Split or Rest for recovery, and Kangaskhan can also take on special attackers that Misdreavus can't handle on its own such as Arcanine, Walrein, and bulky Electric-types such as Ampharos and Lanturn. Misdreavus can struggle against some physical wallbreakers that have coverage for it or hit it neutrally such as offensive Kangaskhan and Solrock, so physically defensive pivots such as Omastar, Granbull, and Hitmontop help against these threats. If Misdreavus isn't running Perish Song, it relies on other Pokemon to check bulky setup sweepers such as Slowking, Curse Muk, and Curse Lapras. Pokemon with Roar such as Blastoise and Lapras are phazers that pair beautifully with Misdreavus, as Roar also helps spread Spikes chip and pressures switches well.</p>"

Nonetheless, Perish trapping is just as--if not more--effective in ADV thanks to Taunt. Trap the foe, Protect to regain health from Leftovers, then use Perish Song or Taunt depending on who is on the field. Stall with Protect and Taunt until it falls, then switch out. Use Destiny Bond if you are sure Misdreavus isn't going to survive the three-turn setup Perish Song needs.</p> <p>This set works best when partnered with Jirachi, who can provide Wish support.

It also works nicely alongside Hidden Power Ice--which forces Ground-types to switch--to help spread paralysis.</p>"}

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are four ways to customize Unown: its Hidden Power type, its held item, its EV spread, and its team slot. One of the most common Hidden Power types seen on Unown other than Psychic is Hidden Power Fighting, which in just about any other metagame would make sense, as it super effectively hits Dark-types that would use Hidden Power Psychic Unown as setup fodder. However, two of the best Dark-types in NU, Murkrow and Sableye, are neutral or immune to it. Other Hidden Power types that threatening Pokemon such as Vigoroth and Flareon might be immune to, including Ghost and Fire, are not recommended. All physical variants of Unown should move the Special Attack EVs into Attack, change the nature from Modest to Adamant, and equip Unown with a Choice Band. Chimecho is a worthwhile replacement for your Unown team slot, as they both have Levitate, and Chimecho has better base stats than Unown in all departments except for Attack, which neither one uses on their primary set. Abra is a frailer alternative to Unown that gives up a type immunity for blazing Speed and extraordinary Special Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dark-types such as Poochyena and Carvanha completely wall Hidden Power Psychic, Ghost-types such as Shuppet and Duskull wall Hidden Power Fighting, and Normal-types such as Igglybuff and Azurill wall Hidden Power Ghost.

Twisted Spoon boosts Hidden Power Psychic, allowing it to 2HKO Hitmonchan and ∞HKO Dark-types such as Sableye, Murkrow, and Cacturne. Levitate gives Unown a type immunity and allows it to switch into top-tier threats such as Choice Band Hitmonchan locked into Earthquake.

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Due to its access to Shadow Tag, Wobbuffet stands as one of the main trappers in ADV Ubers, along with Magneton, Dugtrio, and Umbreon. Wobbuffet separates itself from the other trappers with its superior bulk and the ability to immediately trap any foe. Shadow Tag has no limitation on what can be trapped, which allows Wobbuffet to remove at least one opposing Pokemon in most games. In addition, Wobbuffet's access to Encore prevents it from becoming setup fodder. Encore in conjunction with Shadow Tag can provide teammates with valuable setup opportunities as well.</p> <p>However, Wobbuffet's utility in ADV Ubers is limited due to the overall lack of Choice Band users, as Pokemon that can utilize Choice Band often prefer other items. In addition, most Pokemon carry at least one non-damaging move, which forces Wobbuffet into mind games with Encore. Its passive nature is also exploited by some setup sweepers, meaning that one incorrect read can prove devastating. While Wobbuffet's bulk may ease predictions, its inability to hold Leftovers limits the number of hits it can take: Wobbuffet is banned from holding Leftovers, as Wobbuffet vs. Wobbuffet will always result in an unending battle due to ADV's Struggle mechanics.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With only eight available moves, Wobbuffet's other options are rather limited. Either Tickle or Charm can be used to prevent physical attackers from successfully setting up.</p> <p>Other than alterations to Speed investment, no other EV modification will prove very effective. Spreads with 252 HP EVs and either 252 Defense or 252 Special Defense EVs do not change any crucial 2HKOs into 3HKOs. Most boosted attacks from strong setup sweepers will 2HKO Wobbuffet regardless of its HP investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>A key definition of a counter is having the ability to switch in and remove or force out a target Pokemon. By virtue of its ability in Shadow Tag, it may be said that Wobbuffet does not have any true counters. The best way to defeat it is by exploiting its passive moveset and low Speed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: The easiest way to stop Wobbuffet is by utilizing a fast Taunt user. Taunt Mew and Mewtwo can bypass Encore and proceed to set up on Wobbuffet. Skarmory and Deoxys-D can similarly stop Encore and Safeguard to set up Spikes or use Toxic. Additionally, any faster Pokemon with the ability to poison or burn Wobbuffet will quickly neutralize it. However, be wary of becoming locked into a status move, as Wobbuffet can set up Safeguard and switch out into a dangerous setup sweeper.</p> <p><strong>Counter-trappers</strong>: Dugtrio and Umbreon can counter-trap Wobbuffet. However, Dugtrio must get around Counter to defeat it. Umbreon can trap Wobbuffet with Mean Look and use Baton Pass to bring in a setup sweeper, leaving Wobbuffet helpless as the foe sets up safely behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon with physical moves such as Gengar and Dusclops can attack Wobbuffet without the fear of retaliation from Counter due to their Fighting immunity. However, they must be wary of Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Strong Setup Sweepers</strong>: Strong setup sweepers that can 2HKO Wobbuffet can force awkward predictions. Kyogre deserves a special mention due to its ability to 2HKO Wobbuffet with its rain-boosted attacks prior to any setup. Therefore, Wobbuffet must win a 50/50 with either Encore or Mirror Coat to get around Kyogre. The same holds true for any setup sweepers that boost as Wobbuffet switches in, given that they can 2HKO Wobbuffet after setting up.</p> <p><strong>Self-Destruct and Explosion Users</strong>: Self-Destruct and Explosion from the likes of Metagross, Forretress, and Snorlax will OHKO Wobbuffet, or at least weaken it to the point that it is essentially out of the game.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Using Wobbuffet is simple. Lead with it or switch it in for a revenge KO. Given its good bulk, it can also directly switch into some attacks. Thereafter, Encore is usually the move of choice. If the opposing Pokemon is locked into a damaging move, use Counter or Mirror Coat accordingly. If the foe is locked into a status move, take the opportunity to freely switch into a setup sweeper. Safeguard is usually the preferred final move to protect Wobbuffet and other team members from status. This is especially useful for providing setup sweepers with a safe switch. Alternatively, Destiny Bond can be used to better deal with Pokemon that lack status moves. Against a foe that can 2HKO or 3HKO Wobbuffet, Destiny Bond can at least either punish further setup or force a trade.</p> <p>Wobbuffet is best at removing Choice item users. These include Deoxys-A, Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, Metagross, and, less frequently, Groudon, Snorlax, and Lugia. No single attack from these Pokemon can OHKO a full-health Wobbuffet without a critical hit, and Counter will easily KO back. Choice Band Heracross not locked into Megahorn can also be removed. Lum Berry is the preferred item to cure Wobbuffet of status once.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wobbuffet is a generalist when it comes to trapping. Unless an opposing Pokemon can outpace Wobbuffet and afflict it with poison or burn, it is a target for removal. In theory, Wobbuffet can support any Pokemon.</p> <p>Since most priority users hold Choice Band, Wobbuffet can give Salac Berry users like Groudon, Heracross, and Kyogre an opportunity to sweep. Removing the likes of Choice Band Deoxys-A and Ho-Oh can also increase the sweeping potential of Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Latios, and Latias.</p> <p>The combination of Encore and Shadow Tag also makes strong yet frail setup Pokemon good partners. Pokemon that usually have a difficult time finding setup opportunities can take advantage of Wobbuffet's ability to provide a safe setup turn. This makes Pokemon such as Belly Drum + Baton Pass Smeargle, Substitute Deoxys-A, and Dragon Dance Rayquaza good teammates. Choice Band Swellow can also be an interesting partner; simply lock a foe into a status move, switch Swellow in, and freely spam boosted Facade. A teammate with Roar and Whirlwind such as Kyogre, Groudon, and Ho-Oh can also be used as insurance to prevent foes locked into a setup move from becoming an issue.</p>"

Lum Berry is the preferred item, as it cures Wobbuffet of status once. The given Speed EVs allow Wobbuffet to outpace most special walls, while the given Defense EVs allow Wobbuffet to take a +6 Body Slam from an uninvested Snorlax.</p> <p>Once in play, Wobbuffet can proceed to either use Safeguard against predicted status moves or use Encore to lock opposing Pokemon into both damaging and setup moves. Counter is preferred over Mirror Coat, as it allows Wobbuffett to damage Snorlax locked into a physical move. Destiny Bond ensures that Wobbuffet can secure trades, even against special attacking walls.</p> <p>Against Seismic Toss users, it is advisable to not use Encore until Wobbuffet is within 3HKO range. If a trapped Pokemon lacks any damaging moves, Wobbuffet will likely PP stall it due to Counter and Safeguard’s high PP.

      "overview": "<p>Forretress has established itself as a strong pillar of the ADV metagame due to its access to both Spikes and Rapid Spin. Its Steel / Bug typing, solid resilience, and role compression give common Toxic + Spikes + Sandstorm teams versatility in fitting other Pokemon. Forretress can use its good bulk to set up Spikes on Pokemon that cannot threaten it effectively, such as Skarmory, most Metagross, most Blissey, Milotic, some Celebi, some Zapdos, defensive Swampert, and Porygon2. With Pursuit support, it can also be an effective counter to many TSS teams due to its prowess as a spinner.</p> <p>Forretress is commonly compared to Skarmory and Cloyster as a Spiker and Claydol and defensive Starmie as a spinner. In comparison to Skarmory, Forretress is much more difficult to trap with Magneton, as Forretress's Earthquake OHKOes variants not specifically EVed to survive it. In addition, Modest Magneton's Hidden Power Fire has only a 25% chance to OHKO Forretress, whereas Magneton's Magnet-boosted Thunderbolt is much more likely to eliminate Skarmory. Forretress is much more resilient than Cloyster due to its Toxic and sand immunity as well as superior special bulk. As a spinner, Forretress is a better counter to Skarmory than Claydol and Starmie due to its Toxic immunity; Claydol can run Refresh but is vulnerable to Skarmory's Taunt. Skarmory can still use Taunt on Forretress to prevent Spikes or actively wear it down with Drill Peck, however.</p> <p>Forretress's primary faults lie in its tendency to get worn down, weakness to specially defensive Gengar, and relative passivity. Forretress performs worse as a physical wall than Skarmory despite its numerical bulk advantage, as it can't phaze, typically can't fit Protect to passively recover health, and is damaged by Spikes. Cloyster's superior Speed, resistance to Water, and immunity to being trapped by Magneton allow it to be used on offensive teams that can't fit the rigid support Forretress teams need. Unlike Claydol, Forretress is not immune to the Spikes it is removing, and unlike Starmie, it cannot use a recovery move nor heal status by switching. Forretress is also vulnerable to surprise Fire-type moves from Pokemon such as Metagross and Blissey, which often greatly weaken or OHKO it. Additionally, due to the prominence of specially defensive Gengar, which can't be OHKOed by Tyranitar's Pursuit, Forretress will struggle to use Rapid Spin, as its sets typically have very weak or no options to hurt it. Forretress is also quite easy to set up on with Pokemon like Curse Snorlax, Substitute Heracross, and Jirachi, as its only counterplay is to use Explosion or hit them with weak coverage moves.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Forretress is generally required to be specially defensive, but it has quite a few options for its last moveslots. One of the more prominent of these is Counter, which can defeat Hidden Power Fire variants of Magneton, mixed Metagross, and Celebi—Counter always succeeds against Hidden Power in ADV. Counter also allows Forretress to act as a physical wall, notably improving its matchup against Metagross, Tyranitar, Snorlax, Gyarados, Heracross, and Dugtrio. Forretress survives Snorlax's +6 Earthquake, avoids a 2HKO from even +1 Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash, and takes any of +2 Heracross's attacks bar Focus Punch. Forretress can also use Counter to surprise threats like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Tyranitar, as they need multiple boosts to OHKO Forretress. Counter additionally improves Forretress's matchup against Drill Peck Skarmory—a common way to chip Forretress is using Drill Peck whenever it tries to remove Spikes, but Forretress outdamages Skarmory with Counter.</p> <p>Zap Cannon is often used in tandem with Counter or even over Rapid Spin. It allows Forretress to chip and paralyze Gengar and hit Skarmory fairly hard. Notably, Zap Cannon + Pursuit from Tyranitar is a guaranteed KO on 248 HP / 112 SpD Gengar in sand. Zap Cannon's unreliability is its main drawback, but against Skarmory, Forretress has quite a few chances to use it. Forretress can use a variety of Hidden Power types, such as Hidden Power Fire for completely invalidating opposing Forretress—it does 38.4 - 45.1%—and doing some small chip damage to Skarmory, Hidden Power Ghost for hitting Gengar as hard as possible, and Hidden Power Flying for teams horribly weak to Heracross. These alternate Hidden Power types allow for versatility in choosing teammates—Hidden Power Fire can cover for a lack of Gengar to block opposing Forretress's Rapid Spin, as an example. For both Hidden Power Fire and Zap Cannon, make sure to give Forretress a Sassy nature to increase power.</p> <p>Toxic is also a very nice choice on Forretress, as many of its common switch-ins, such as non-Refresh Claydol, Starmie, Moltres, and Salamence really hate being poisoned. It additionally improves Forretress's match-up against Cloyster considerably; watch out for Gengar or Magneton switching into Toxic, however. Forretress can also run Protect to help with residual damage or Light Screen to assist with tanking special hits from Magneton or to help teammates; however, these moves are often difficult to fit.</p> <p>Despite being very slow, maximum Speed investment allows Forretress to use Explosion on most Claydol sets before they can remove Spikes on aggressive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar spinblocks and forces Forretress out, making it take more Spikes damage when it switches in again to remove Spikes. Defensive Gengar avoids the OHKO after sand from Pursuit Tyranitar, whereas offensive Gengar can run Hidden Power Grass, Hypnosis, or even Focus Punch to defeat Pursuit Tyranitar on the switch. Even a defensive Gengar hit by Pursuit on the switch is a risk to Forretress, as Forretress commonly runs sets that do little or no damage to Gengar. If Forretress chooses to stay in, it risks being burned or possibly OHKOed by Gengar's Fire Punch. Dusclops is rare but threatens Forretress the same way.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Forretress can beat Magneton, but Magneton will always do major damage to Forretress with Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt before falling to Earthquake if it switches in safely. Additionally, Magneton can use an EV spread of 240 HP / 80 Def to survive Forretress's Earthquake. Hidden Power Fire Magneton should be careful of the occasional Counter, which will always OHKO it if it uses Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Forretress is not immune to Spikes, and therefore, it can be worn down easily if not played carefully. An example of this unfavorable situation is Skarmory using Taunt against Forretress to prevent Spikes, then switching to Gengar on the ensuing Rapid Spin. Being forced in via Roar with Spikes down wears Forretress down quite a bit.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves and Pokemon</strong>: Teams with multiple Pokemon using Fire-type moves, such as Moltres, Charizard, Blaziken, Fire Blast Tyranitar, and Fire Blast Salamence as well as surprise ones from Blissey, Metagross, Snorlax, Porygon2, and Regice, can greatly damage, if not OHKO, Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Setup Threats</strong>: Forretress and its common partners are frequently weak to Calm Mind users such as Jirachi, Celebi, and Suicune. Forretress without Hidden Power Bug or Explosion is setup fodder for these Pokemon, and it is generally scared of Jirachi and Celebi's Fire-type coverage. This weakness is exacerbated by Forretress's most common phazer teammates being Pursuit Tyranitar and Swampert with Surf as its only attack, both of which don't have strong offensive pressure and are defensively poor against Grass- and Water-type coverage. Forretress's offensive output besides Explosion does not scare physical sweepers like Curse Snorlax, Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Substitute or Swords Dance Heracross. While these Pokemon typically won't try to switch in and counter Forretress, they can be very dangerous against Forretress and its common partners with momentum.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Claydol, Starmie, opposing Forretress, and even Donphan can easily remove the Spikes that Forretress sets up. While Forretress can combat these Pokemon, they can easily weaken Forretress so that another threat such as Magneton or Dugtrio can remove it with certainty. Forretress needs Hidden Power Bug to have any chance against Starmie and Claydol, whereas Forretress will stalemate with itself unless it has Hidden Power Fire. Donphan doesn't particularly care about anything Forretress runs besides Toxic and Explosion.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Forretress sets Spikes up against a wide variety of Pokemon and can often do so multiple times a game due to its bulk. With maximum special bulk and Leftovers, Forretress shields itself as much as possible against Magneton and greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can use Spikes on, like Milotic and Zapdos. In addition, this allows Forretress to better combat defensive Starmie trying to remove Spikes. Almost all Forretress run Rapid Spin due to Spikes's prominence in the metagame. Beware of teams likely to have defensive Gengar, as opponents will often liberally bring it in on Forretress with their Spikes laid to prevent losing them as well as to force Forretress out.</p> <p>After Spikes and Rapid Spin, Forretress's options open up quite a bit, letting it defeat some of its counters or be a general threat with Explosion. Hidden Power Bug helps against Claydol and Starmie as well as Celebi and Tyranitar. It is a guaranteed 3HKO at least on both Claydol and Starmie—this discourages them from performing their duty of removing Spikes. It also 2HKOes all variants of Celebi, which is useful due to Forretress teams frequently being weak to Celebi passing Calm Mind or Swords Dance. If Gengar tries to block Rapid Spin, Hidden Power Bug can remove it after sand if it was hit by Pursuit upon switching out, easing Forretress's ability to keep Spikes off the field. Earthquake Forretress OHKOes most Magneton and damages Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi. If you suspect Magneton is on the opposing team, aggressively using Earthquake as it comes in can be a game-winning play. Earthquake's utility against Metagross can be very important to stop it, especially Choice Band sets, from accumulating chances for Meteor Mash boosts and potentially steamrolling Forretress's team, especially since the best common option to phaze Metagross is a Roar Swampert that lacks its own Earthquake. Earthquake also gives Forretress an option to combat Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Substitute non-Fire Punch Jirachi in desperate situations. Forretress can additionally use Explosion, which notably prevents setup from Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Salamence. It can additionally eliminate threats coming in, such as Moltres and Charizard. Smart uses of Explosion include against incoming Claydol and Starmie to keep Spikes up, on paralyzed threats to end turns—since Explosion prevents action by slower threats in ADV—or even against Rock-resistant Pokemon or walls to set up an Aerodactyl or mixed Salamence sweep. Be careful of Gengar switching in, however. Picking two of Hidden Power Bug, Earthquake, and Explosion is up to personal preference outside of teams with specific needs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress needs specific support from its teammates in order to be most effective: Pursuit support for removing Gengar, special walls for the strong threats like Moltres it often attracts, good physical answers for the threats that try to set up on it, like Salamence and Snorlax, and Pokemon that take advantage of the extra residual damage Spikes provides. Tyranitar is by far the best partner for Forretress. It not only sets up the sand that helps make Spikes damage stick, but it also Pursuit traps Gengar, acts as a solid answer to Moltres as well as some Snorlax, and takes advantage of Spikes with Roar or a well-timed Focus Punch. With smart play, Pursuit Tyranitar can remove Claydol and Starmie to prevent Rapid Spin, but be careful of their Earthquake and Surf, which will typically 2HKO Tyranitar. However, Forretress's Pursuit trapper does not have to be Tyranitar—Umbreon and Houndoom are other options that can also free up Tyranitar to run a physical set, such as Choice Band, Dragon Dance, or bulky physical attacker, that benefits more from Spikes. Forretress can also be run without a Pursuit Pokemon if it has additional assistance from another Rapid Spin user such as Claydol, though this pairing is relatively niche. Gengar is another good Forretress teammate because it not only greatly appreciates Spikes, but it also helps keep Spikes up against Claydol, Starmie, opposing Forretress, and even the rare Donphan. A Forretress, Gengar, and Tyranitar core is commonly used to take advantage of Spikes and keep them up against spinners while also finding opportunities to trap and remove them.</p> <p>As for special walls, the standard on many Forretress teams is Blissey, often with Wish to help Forretress deal with residual damage. It also commonly runs Counter, sometimes with Wish as well, due to Forretress teams generally being weak to mixed sweepers such as Salamence and Tyranitar. This point is especially true when the team does not have strong physical walls. However, the special wall can easily be Jirachi, which has an easier time fitting Wish, works well with Pursuit trappers to prevent Gengar from burning it, and shores the team up against physical threats such as Metagross, Fighting-type Pokemon, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar. Wish support in general from not only Blissey and Jirachi but also Salamence and Umbreon can be helpful to keep Forretress and its teammates healthy, especially if Spikes can't be removed as easily. Celebi can fill the specially defensive role, as it is stronger against defensive Water-types such as Rest Suicune and switches into Leech Seed from opposing Celebi and Venusaur. Beware of offensive Water-types such as fast Calm Mind Suicune and Starmie hitting hard or freezing with potentially boosted Ice Beam, however. Specially defensive Roar + Rest Zapdos is a good choice on these teams, as it provides additional support against Calm Mind Pokemon like Celebi, Jirachi, and Suicune and mixed Salamence, which often tries to take advantage of Forretress. It also is great as additional support against offensive Water-types, such as the aforementioned Suicune and Starmie, which love to spam Hydro Pump against Forretress and its common teammates. Furthermore, it stops Gyarados from taking advantage of Forretress's passivity. Zapdos can even use Light Screen to give Forretress a better chance against Magneton.</p> <p>For physical walls, Forretress appreciates Pokemon like Swampert and Flygon to help the team handle physical threats such as Tyranitar and Salamence. Defensive Metagross, Milotic, and bulky Roar Suicune can also work on some Forretress teams, as they check the Rock-type threats and Metagross that can break apart Forretress teams. Milotic is especially nice here, as it also is a fantastic counter to Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard as well as mixed Salamence, which prey on Forretress and its common teammates. Dugtrio can also be helpful on some Forretress teams because it can trap threats such as Calm Mind Celebi, Calm Mind Jirachi, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Heracross—dangerous Pokemon that are typically difficult to handle for many Forretress teams.</p> <p>Forretress really appreciates Pokemon that can take advantage of Spikes. Roar is a good option to repeatedly force Spikes damage on foes, and it can easily be fit on essential teammates, such as Pursuit Tyranitar, Swampert, Suicune, and even mixed Salamence. Outside of Roar users, Zapdos, physical Tyranitar, Gengar, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Venusaur, and Moltres work well. Aerodactyl is especially strong, as it not only benefits from a good Skarmory answer and Pursuit support, but it also cleans effectively with Spikes and helps against Calm Mind and Swords Dance Baton Pass Celebi with Hidden Power Bug. Moltres is a nice middle-ground switch-in against Gengar, as it is immune to Gengar's Will-O-Wisp and takes a pittance from Grass-type coverage and Focus Punch meant for catching Pursuit Tyranitar. Moltres, Salamence, and Gengar also provide a switch-in to Heracross—a dangerous threat that takes advantage of the lack of Drill Peck Skarmory on these types of teams. Very aggressive Forretress teams can also run their own Fighting-type Pokemon such as Medicham, Breloom, or Hariyama, as its role compression of Spiker and spinner allows TSS teams to fit a variety of Pokemon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Everyone loves Dunsparce, but no one loves to be on the receiving end of its haxing skills. I believe he is always a good choice for a UU team. He can take a fair few hits, and deal back some slow, steady damage, while the opponent can't do a thing and you restore health with Leftovers! Just don't overestimate his lifespan and be too risky... but other than that, have fun!</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quite a few options here, most of which take advantage of Serene Grace. That 20% chance of a full stat boost from Ancient Power is always good, which can potentially make Dunsparce a good Pokemon (:o indeed!) Glare can paralyze more Pokemon than Thunder Wave or Body Slam can, being able to hit both Ground- and Ghost-types, but that accuracy winds me up sometimes. Ice Beam has that 20% chance of a freeze, but I don't use it much, as Dunsparce is all about paraflinch. Water Pulse has a 40% chance of confusion, quite chancey, always up for consideration. Attract can get piss annoying, and will at least force a switch, as does Yawn, but remember it doesn't go hand in hand with paralysis. And Counter is a nice surprise; you don't see it much on this Pokemon.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>I usually max out HP, load quite a bit into Attack, and distribute the rest into its defenses. Go with Adamant. Unless, of course, you do decide to use one of those special attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>He may have a buttload of HP, but he can't really take a strong attack, least of all a Brick Break. His low Speed leaves him susceptible to status effects as well, like sleep and so forth, shutting down his whole operation. Watch out primarily for the likes of Machamp, Hariyama, Jumpluff and friends. And getting burned by Banette is never cool.</p>",
      "sets": {"Paraflinch": {"description": "<p>Dunsparce is a highly diverse Pokemon; I find it works better as a physical sweeper in a UU game. Flinching enemies constantly with Serene Grace + Headbutt is very annoying, and no Pokemon will score it more than Dunsparce, especially when a paralyzed foe is left in. Basically, use Thunder Wave (or Body Slam if you want the 60% chance of paralyzing a Ground Pokemon), maybe again if you predict a switch. Then Headbutt or Rock Slide for some major flinching!</p> <p>Shadow Ball is really only there to hit Ghosts, and with repeated Special Defense drops, it can trigger a switch later on. Rock Slide is primarily there to take out the common Jumpluff, Fearow and Swellow, but if you decide to risk using Dunsparce outside of UU, you may be able to score a KO against Skarmory... something I have managed to do with this Dunsparce many times.</p>"}}

  "Gligar": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Gligar stands out in ADV UU as one of the best Ground-types and Swords Dance sweepers, being one of the most consistent punishers of the ubiquitous Kangaskhan's Rest. Gligar's Ground / Flying typing gives it a very good offensive and defensive profile. Many tier staples, such as Omastar, Arcanine, Tentacruel, and Ampharos, are weak to Earthquake; combine this with the fact that these Pokemon are commonly paired together, and Gligar can actively threaten a majority of team's defensive cores. Gligar separates itself from other Swords Dance users such as Scyther and Pinsir by being quite the apt physical hit-taker, not only with its good base Defense but also with its bevy of resistances and immunities as well as Hyper Cutter to block Intimidate from physical walls such as Granbull and Hitmontop.</p> <p>However, Gligar's typing is a double-edged sword, making it 4x weak to Ice-type moves from the Electric-types like Ampharos, Electrode, Electabuzz it would ideally check otherwise. Gligar's measly base Attack also means its damage can be disappointing without Swords Dance boosts or a Choice Band, having trouble pressuring bulky targets without Spikes up. This means that even when Gligar can hit a foe super effectively, it has worse potential to trade damage when their response can OHKO it back, notably in the cases of Omastar, Ampharos, and Nidoqueen. While Gligar has a Speed tier atop many Pokemon, it isn't enough for other common offensive threats that can outspeed it, such as Arcanine, Scyther, Tentacruel, and Hitmonlee, making it more easy to offensively check.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Bulky EV spread using 96 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Def / 140 Spe with an Impish nature lets Gligar avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Flying, which makes it better at weathering hits from physical wallbreakers. Gligar can use different secondary attack options over Hidden Power Flying, such as Rock Slide to OHKO Scyther without boosts and hit other Flying-types like Altaria, Xatu, and Fearow or Hidden Power Ghost to hit Solrock, Lunatone, and Misdreavus super effectively. Gligar's good physical bulk makes it an effective Counter user, letting it check Solrock without the need for Iron Tail and giving it a way to retaliate against offensive Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Granbull. Toxic is able to cripple Gligar's common switch-ins such as Solrock, Blastoise, and Walrein, setting them on a timer and slowly pushing them into range of Gligar's boosted attacks. Substitute can also be used alongside Toxic to stall for Toxic damage against defensive Pokemon, although this comes at the cost of limited offensive presence without Swords Dance. Rest can be used on semi-stall teams with cleric support to maintain a long-term offensive threat and shrug off status. Steel Wing can be used in place of Iron Tail for its perfect accuracy, but Iron Tail is preferred for its ability to OHKO most offensive Solrock variants at +2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Lapras, Walrein, and Slowking are great at withstanding Gligar's attacks and OHKOing it back with Surf or Ice Beam. Even Ground-weak Water-types can withstand its weak unboosted Earthquake in the case of Omastar, outspeed it in the case of Tentacruel, or prevent its possible entry in the case of Lanturn. Water-type sweepers such as Rain Dance Omastar, Gorebyss, Feraligatr, and Golduck can also use their entry on Gligar to set up and threaten to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Most Flying-type Pokemon can check Gligar by being immune to Earthquake while shrugging off its other coverage. Altaria is one of the best Gligar checks, tanking any boosted attack from Gligar with ease and threatening it back with an Ice Beam OHKO. Xatu outspeeds Gligar and 2HKOes it with Psychic, using Reflect to tank its hits and Early Bird + Rest to heal off any damage it lands. Even though Gligar can come in on Scyther's Bug-type moves and threaten it back, it must be careful when switching into Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Flying or Double-Edge. While uncommon, Fearow can offensively threaten Gligar in a similar way to Choice Band Scyther with a stronger Flying-type STAB option in Drill Peck, having the benefit of not being weak to Gligar's Hidden Power Flying.</p> <p><strong>Levitate Users</strong>: Levitate users are immune to Gligar's Earthquake and can tank Gligar's other hits decently. Solrock and Lunatone both resist Hidden Power Flying while threatening Gligar with Choice Band Rock Slide or Ice Beam, respectively. However, they have to respect the possibility of Gligar running Iron Tail, which can flip these matchups. Misdreavus can survive a boosted Hidden Power Flying while OHKOing Gligar back with Hidden Power Ice. While Haunter is frailer than Misdreavus, it can outspeed Gligar and use Will-O-Wisp to take negligible damage, or it can take the simpler route of OHKOing Gligar with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon</strong>: While Gligar isn't slow, many common wallbreakers can get the Speed jump on it and take advantage of Gligar's low Special Defense in the cases of Arcanine, Tentacruel, and Electabuzz. Scyther can also use the Speed advantage to respond to Gligar with Choice Band Double-Edge or Hidden Power Flying to prevent its entry or revenge kill it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Gligar primarily takes the role of a Swords Dance sweeper that uses its good bulk to set up on physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Scyther and break through common defensive cores. Hidden Power Flying provides a secondary STAB option for Scyther while also dealing more meaningful damage to Vileplume and Hitmontop. For Gligar's last move, Quick Attack can be used for a priority option to check pinch Berry sweepers such as Reversal Scyther and Petaya Berry Electrode and Manectric, and it can pick off faster foes like Tentacruel with prior chip damage. Iron Tail is an alternative option to hit Solrock and Lunatone, which resist both of Gligar's STAB attacks. A Jolly nature allows Gligar to Speed tie with other base 85 Speed foes such as Qwilfish, Nidoking, and Pinsir, while an Adamant nature increases its general damage in conjunction with Swords Dance. 16 Special Defense EVs can be used to consistently survive Timid Arcanine's Fire Blast from full health, allowing Gligar to respond with Earthquake. Substitute can be run over Quick Attack or Iron Tail with a Salac Berry to mitigate Gligar's low Speed and pose a more dangerous sweeping threat late-game, as it isn't KOed at 25% health from all common forms of priority. With this set, Gligar's HP should be divisible by four so Salac Berry can be consumed at 25% health or after three Substitutes maximum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gligar struggles with what last move it wants to run between Quick Attack and Iron Tail, but good team support can alleviate these issues. If Gligar lacks Quick Attack, it appreciates teammates with their own priority moves for fast sweepers, such as Arcanine with Extreme Speed and Scyther with Quick Attack. If Gligar lacks Iron Tail, it likes Pokemon that are able to reliably switch into and check Solrock such as Omastar, Blastoise, and Hitmontop. The best way that Gligar can gain a Swords Dance boost is by coming in on Kangakshan's Rest, therefore, it's good to pair it with Pokemon that can lure Kangaskhan with Toxic, such as Omastar, Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Lanturn, and bulky attackers that can trade hits well with Kangaskhan, such as Arcanine, Lapras, and Walrein. Gligar heavily appreciates Spikes support to make up for its lack of power in pressuring switches, incrementally helping to push bulky foes in range of its boosted Earthquake. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie are good Spikes setters to accomplish this, as they can also help against bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Walrein that Gligar can have trouble with. Omastar can use Toxic or Hidden Power Electric to chip them, while Qwilfish and Glalie can use Explosion to break open a hole in the opposing team that Gligar that can capitalize on. Having Pokemon to switch into Water-types is also helpful if Gligar is forced out, making Kangaskhan, Walrein, Lanturn, and Lapras good defensive partners. While Gligar can threaten Electric-types, all of them pose the threat of Ice-type coverage to scare it out. Therefore, Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn can help by reliably switching into them. Gligar swotching into passive Pokemon makes it vulnerable to status from Kangaskhan, Hitmontop, and Vileplume. Clerics such as Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, and Granbull can help with this and increase Gligar's longevity as an offensive threat.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>When holding a Choice Band, Gligar acts as a conventional wallbreaker that pressures soft checks to Ground-types such as Blastoise, Walrein, and Lapras, and its access to both Hyper Cutter and a priority move sets it apart from other Choice Band users. Hidden Power Flying is a secondary STAB option for Ground-immune Pokemon like Scyther, Misdreavus, and Altaria while hitting physically defensive Pokemon like Vileplume and Hitmontop hard as well. Iron Tail complements Gligar's STAB moves by hitting Solrock and Lunatone while also consistently 2HKOing Cradily. Finally, Quick Attack lets Gligar deal with pinch Berry sweepers such as Reversal Scyther, and it can pick off faster foes like Arcanine and Tentacruel when they're chipped. An Adamant nature maximizes Gligar's immediate damage, letting it 2HKO bulky Kangaskhan variants and OHKO offensive Solrock with Iron Tail, but a Jolly nature can be used instead to Speed tie with other base 85 Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Pinsir, and Nidoking. 16 EVs can be placed in Special Defense to consistently survive Timid Arcanine's Fire Blast from full health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Choice Band Gligar has substantial power, it appreciates Spikes support to pressure bulky targets trying to switch in. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie are great Spikes setters, with Omastar providing extra defensive support against Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Solrock, and Qwilfish and Glalie using Explosion against bulky Water-types. Due to Gligar's hit-and-run nature while needing to Choice lock, it will likely be switching multiple times throughout a match and thus appreciates a good defensive backbone. Since Gligar doesn't have Leftovers to bolster its defensive utility, it appreciates Wish support from Kangaskhan to increase its longevity. If Scyther, Solrock, or opposing Gligar come in on Earthquake, Gligar appreciates physical walls like Omastar, Granbull, and Blastoise being able to switch into them. Gligar beating down bulky Water-types mid-game is appreciated by offensive Pokemon that like them weakened, such as Arcanine, Swords Dance Tentacruel, and Rain Dance Omastar.</p>"

However, it isn't used much because of its subpar offenses; base 85 Attack is not impressive at all, and consequently, quite a few standards take little damage from its attacks. It is far from unusable, though; it is one of the best BL Pokemon available.</p>",

In general, any Water-type with decent defenses can come in easily, shrug off Steelix's hits, and OHKO or 2HKO it with Surf; examples include Suicune, Swampert, Milotic, Slowbro, and Vaporeon.

Iron Tail and Hidden Power Steel are both options for its Steel-type STAB, and the choice between them comes down to a simple power vs. accuracy argument; the former is preferred as it is Steelix's most powerful option against Gengar, Aerodactyl, and Regice. There are three options for the third moveslot: Double-Edge is a powerful move with good neutral coverage, while Hidden Power Rock and Rock Slide deal heavy damage to Zapdos.

      "overview": "<p>Scizor is an interesting Pokemon. Its type, Bug / Steel, is a cool defensive type with only one weakness (4x to Fire). It has a base Attack of 130. It can learn Agility to make up for its low Speed. Finally, it can survive most Explosions with about 10% or 20% to spare. So, the question remains: why the hell isn't it used more often?</p> <p>Simple: its offensive movepool sucks. The only useful attacks it gets are Silver Wind, Steel Wing, and Hidden Power. While it does get STAB off Silver Wind and Steel Wing, their low Base Powers mean they won't do any major damage to teams. Physical walls and tanks completely shut it down, any Fire-type attack will always OHKO it, and even Blissey can hurt it with Thunder Wave if it lacks Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>However, for what it has to work with, Scizor isn't too bad. On occasion, Silver Wind can give stat boosts and provide it with some additional staying power. Agility grants it the potential to sweep. It can OHKO Psychic-types that lack a Fire move, such as Alakazam without Fire Punch; it can survive any attack from Aerodactyl and OHKO back with Steel Wing; finally, it can OHKO Jolteon with Hidden Power Ground. Scizor is not a bad Pokemon, but requires some setup and, occasionally, a little luck.</p>",

Aside from Mawile, it is the only Baton Pass user that resists Normal-type attacks, and it has the HP and Defense to back this up.

Agility ensures Scizor will go first, while Scizor's Steel typing ensures it won't die to sandstorm after using Endure.</p> <p>Don't be tempted to use either Salac Berry or Substitute; keep Scizor's poor base 65 Speed in mind. Even after the Salac boost, it cannot outspeed Jolteon and Aerodactyl, but Agility lets it outspeed everything but Ninjask. In fact, if you like, you can give Scizor 176 Speed EVs to let it outrun Adamant Ninjask, but even with the full 252 Speed EVs, Scizor cannot outspeed Jolly Ninjask, and it's not worth it to run a Jolly nature purely to beat out Ninjask.</p>"},

      "overview": "<p>With its high Attack stat and powerful STAB Megahorn, Heracross is one of the most fearsome wallbreakers in ADV OU that threatens slow-paced teams with Pokemon such as Claydol and defensive Celebi. Even its checks are not foolproof, as Gengar dares not burn it because of Guts, while Dugtrio risks being caught by Substitute or Salac Berry variants. Generally speaking, with support from trappers, Choice Band Heracross's STAB moves can easily overwhelm an opposing team.</p> <p>However, although Heracross can pivot into bulky Water-types such as Milotic, it doesn't contribute much defensively; Salamence is troublesome for offensive teams with Heracross, while some balanced teams with Heracross suffer against Moltres. In addition, a well-switched Dugtrio can remove Heracross before it works.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Chesto Berry and Hidden Power Ghost, Heracross can lure and wear down Hypnosis Gengar. Chesto Berry can also be used alongside Rest for extra longevity. Endure or Substitute + Reversal sets can be really powerful, but sand limits their viability. Still, these sets can be used with weather changers like Charizard and Kingdra, and even without Reversal, Heracross pairs well with them anyway, exploiting their Dugtrio synergy and acting as an offensive pivot into special walls. Hidden Power Rock doesn't have accuracy issues compared to Rock Slide, and Rock Tomb might help Heracross overcome hovering threats by lowering their Speed or even deter Salamence or Gyarados from setting up with Dragon Dance. Hidden Power Flying can be used on teams weak to opposing Heracross. Thief potentially steals Leftovers from Salamence and Gengar, which are notoriously difficult to lure and remove entirely. A Bulk Up set with three attacks is an interesting prospect for Heracross. Although it is generally outclassed by its Swords Dance counterpart, with Salamence and Gyarados still OHKOing it even at +1 Defense anyway, Bulk Up allows Heracross to survive Dugtrio's Aerial Ace. Earthquake is a reliable option for Metagross and Jirachi, but Megahorn usually does enough to them. Body Slam, with some luck, can be used to paralyze and disable almost all hovering threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Salamence and Gyarados resist Heracross's STAB attacks, have Intimidate to reduce damage, and can OHKO back with Hidden Power Flying or threaten to take the opportunity to set up with Dragon Dance. Mixed Salamence also has Fire Blast for Heracross. Still, Rock Slide hits both of them hard. Skarmory resists Megahorn, takes about 30% from Brick Break, hits Heracross hard with Drill Peck, and can take the opportunity to lay Spikes. However, it is unreliable because it can be severely damaged by Focus Punch and trapped by Magneton. Offensive Zapdos outspeeds Heracross, can use Roar to prevent it from setting up, and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt or OHKO it with Drill Peck, but it is not a reliable check at all, as it can get taken out by successive hits of Megahorn and Rock Slide. Furthermore, Choice Band Heracross can OHKO Zapdos with Rock Slide. Aerodactyl can pivot into unboosted attacks and OHKO Heracross with Hidden Power Flying, but it will not survive Focus Punch or boosted Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Gengar can use Fire Punch to 2HKO Heracross, Explosion to trade, or Hypnosis to put Heracross to sleep. It can also burn Swarm Heracross with Will-O-Wisp. Weezing resists Megahorn and can eliminate Heracross with Fire Blast, Flamethrower, or Sludge Bomb. Especially with Gengar, one might want to avoid inflicting Heracross with status through Will-O-Wisp for fear of activating Guts.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can trap and take out Heracross with Aerial Ace. However, it's not going to take hits bar Rock Slide and Hidden Power Ghost and is very prone to allowing Salac Berry variants to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Moltres and Charizard resist STAB moves from Heracross and can OHKO uninvested variants, but they are OHKOed by Rock Slide. Houndoom outspeeds Heracross and OHKOes it with Fire Blast.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set mostly acts as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker, capitalizing on bulky Psychic-, Normal-, and Water-types. Megahorn OHKOes Celebi and Claydol, has a chance to 3HKO defensive Suicune and Swampert, and 2HKOes Blissey and Snorlax. Furthermore, it can also allow Heracross to hold its ground against more offensive non-hovering special threats by threatening to 2HKO offensive Suicune and OHKO Jolteon. Rock Slide punishes switch-ins such as Salamence, Gyarados, Zapdos, and Moltres. Focus Punch is for a predicted switch to Skarmory, thus being mostly used when Magneton is absent on the team. In addition, it exploits Rest Pokemon such as Snorlax and Hariyama. Otherwise, Brick Break 2HKOes Snorlax and Blissey without the inaccuracy of Megahorn and OHKOes Magneton.</p> <p>When it comes to the last slot, Swords Dance gives Heracross the ability to sweep bulkier teams and can be used set up on a predicted switch or a Choice-locked Earthquake. After a Swords Dance, Rock Slide OHKOes Zapdos and offensive Gengar and has a chance to OHKO Adamant Gyarados and slower variants of Salamence. Substitute pairs well with Focus Punch, allowing Heracross to scout for Drill Peck on Skarmory and potentially play mind games with it. Substitute can also catch an attempted sacrifice into a Dugtrio trap, protect Heracross from Forretress, bring Heracross into Swarm range, and exploit the miss rate of Swampert's Hydro Pump. Adamant Hidden Power Ghost comfortably KOes Gengar in sand after Megahorn, making Heracross a Gengar lure.</p> <p>Guts is generally the preferred ability on this set to allow Heracross to face Gengar and Zapdos without fear, but Swarm is appropriate when the team has additional Gengar pivots like Starmie and when Heracross's HP can be controlled with Substitute. An Adamant nature increases the odds that Suicune, Swampert, Snorlax, Metagross, Gengar, and Gyarados are taken out with one less hit, but Jolly allows Heracross to outspeed slower variants of Salamence, Modest Zapdos, and Modest Moltres. Jolly Heracross only needs 216 Speed EVs to outspeeds Modest Moltres and Timid Venusaur, so the rest can be allocated to bulk.</p> <p>Heracross can also be given varying amounts of bulk. Bulk EVs are useful on the Leftovers set, as this Heracross doesn't get chipped into KO range by sand. Although maximum Speed is straightforward, a little bulk can go a long way; lowering the Speed to 250 and putting the remaining EVs in HP lets Heracross outspeed Adamant Claydol while increasing the odds of surviving Jirachi's and Celebi's Psychic, fast variants of which offensive teams frequently use to check Heracross. Swarm might be preferred here, as Heracross gets a 50% chance to OHKO bulkless Jirachi after taking Psychic. An alternative way to EV Heracross is to make it bulky with 144 HP / 184 SpD, which allows Heracross to survive Timid Zapdos's Thunderbolt twice, Timid Moltres's Flamethrower in sand, and +1 Adamant Dragon Dance Tyranitar's Rock Slide in sand. The rest of the EVs are split between Attack and Speed; Heracross should achieve at least 244 Speed to outrun Jolly Tyranitar, but it is recommended to add more Speed EVs to creep Celebi, Jirachi, and Zapdos that also try to achieve the same benchmark.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dugtrio easily traps Heracross without Substitute or Salac Berry, so having one's own Dugtrio or Porygon2 as a partner can be helpful either to trap Dugtrio beforehand or to revenge kill it. By using Heracross as bait, this core also paves the way for other Dugtrio-weak teammates like Tyranitar, Celebi, Jirachi, and Raikou to shine. Porygon2 also defensively synergizes with Heracross; of all Dugtrio-immune threats, Salamence is the one that Heracross finds the hardest time breaking through, but apart from Choice Band-boosted Brick Break, Porygon2 nullifies whatever Salamence throws at it. In addition to the Dugtrio revenge kill tactic, offensive Celebi and Jirachi also appreciate the chip damage that Heracross induces on Salamence and Zapdos, bringing them into KO range of boosted Psychic. Defensively, with Dugtrio, Jirachi suffices as a Rock-resistant Pokemon that only needs to halt Aerodactyl, because Heracross exerts massive offensive pressure on Tyranitar, and Dugtrio can revenge kill Tyranitar should something go wrong. Celebi and Jirachi also appreciate Heracross's ability to pivot into Hidden Power Bug or Earthquake from Tyranitar, and Heracross gets to come in for free after Dugtrio takes the grounded Psychic-types out.</p> <p>Paralysis support such as Thunder Wave from Zapdos onto opposing Zapdos or Jolteon or Thunder Wave from Gyarados onto the opponent's whole slew of fast threats allows Heracross to fully exploit its high Attack without being forced out. Substitute Heracross can also exploit opportunities generated by full paralysis. Through Baton Pass or double switching, Zapdos provides entry points for Heracross by luring Blissey, Celebi, Snorlax, Claydol, and Tyranitar. Furthermore, Zapdos provides coverage against Dugtrio-immune threats like Gyarados, Skarmory, Gengar, Moltres and Charizard, which all annoy Heracross. Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert check Salamence, which comes in rather freely on Heracross. Suicune can pivot into Moltres and Charizard, while Swampert can also pivot into and play mind games with Zapdos. In addition, they can lure and weaken Zapdos.</p> <p>Other physical threats can also complement Heracross. Choice Band or mixed Metagross can lure Skarmory and Zapdos in and either wear them down or take them out with Explosion and Thunder Punch or Rock Slide. Occasionally, Heracross's Ground resistance allows it to be a pivot into Claydol's Earthquake for Metagross. As a Water-type pivot, Heracross can bear the brunt of the opponent's bulky Water-types, softening the opponent's team before Tyranitar presents itself. Chipping Metagross, Gengar, and Zapdos with Heracross is going to be immensely useful in preparing for a sweep by Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, or mixed Salamence. To obtain these setup opportunities, Dragon Dance sweepers can capitalize on Choice-locked Aerial Ace from Dugtrio, and conversely, Heracross can exploit Dugtrio revenge killing Tyranitar or Metagross in the same vein as Jirachi to chip its checks.</p> <p>Finally, Magneton can be used with Heracross to remove Skarmory, but this is perhaps the set that least requires Magneton support due to Focus Punch. Still, removing Drill Peck Skarmory in particular eliminates the need for making predictions with Focus Punch.</p>"
        },
        "SubSalac": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The key to this set is that with Swords Dance, Swarm, and Salac Berry, Heracross becomes a threatening sweeper that outspeeds and annihilates almost the entire metagame with Megahorn. Substitute is primarily used to activate Salac Berry and to get into Swarm range, but it also blocks status moves and eases prediction. The last move depends on whether or not Magneton is present on the team to eliminate Skarmory. Without Skarmory around, Rock Slide provides better coverage; after a Swords Dance, Rock Slide OHKOes bulkless Salamence and Gyarados 75% of the time even after Intimidate, and OHKOes Moltres, Charizard, and defensive Zapdos as well. Note that with Swarm and STAB, even resisted Megahorn is almost as strong as super effective Rock Slide and will OHKO offensive Zapdos and Aerodactyl after Swords Dance. Focus Punch 2HKOes Skarmory and combines well with Substitute to alleviate predictions, especially against Drill Peck Skarmory. With 30 HP IVs, Salac Berry activates after the third Substitute, preventing sand from immediately KOing Heracross before it can sweep.</p> <p>This Heracross plays out rather differently depending on the filler move. With Rock Slide, the preferred gameplan involves taking out Heracross's checks before revealing itself, as it cannot do much with unboosted Megahorn early-game. However, with Focus Punch, Heracross can also do some wallbreaking early-game so that even if it eventually finds its HP too low to sweep, it has paved the way for teammates to take over. In brief, the Focus Punch variant lends itself to more fluid situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In general, Salac Berry Heracross features on fast-paced offensive teams. With Rock Slide in the filler moveslot, it requires Magneton support to remove Skarmory. Gengar doesn't necessarily prohibit Heracross from sweeping, but Heracross falls short of OHKOing it after a Swords Dance and Swarm boost. So, Pursuit Metagross helps to obtain that chip damage on Gengar; compared to Pursuit Tyranitar, it not only avoids setting up Sand Stream, which chips down Salac Berry Heracross, but also has more offensive presence with Explosion. Speaking of sand, having a fast Pokemon with Rain Dance or Sunny Day such as Zapdos, Salamence, or Suicune helps to clear the sky for Heracross's longevity. Magneton can also clear sand, but it is unreliable for doing so due to its propensity of being trapped and its lackluster Speed. With Magneton for first trapping Metagross, it is also possible to use offensive Snorlax with Earthquake and Self-Destruct to bait and remove Tyranitar for the weather change. Offensive Suicune is a partner with complementary sweeping abilities; while Heracross is impressive at taking out stall teams but may have some trouble breaking through a well-played Salamence, especially with Intimidate drops, or staying alive with sand in play from late-game Tyranitar, offensive Suicune tends to be able to clean up against these physical or mixed threats. Salamence can be a partner with multiple functions: mixed Salamence can lure in and chip Gengar, and with its Speed, it can even clean up if Heracross misses a hit, while Dragon Dance Salamence complements Heracross in its ability to cleave through offenses while Heracross punches through stalls. It can take over the sweep if the opponent sacrifices a bulky Pokemon in order to take down Heracross. Finally, as a minor point on Magneton, although it can be revenge killed by Dugtrio, many teams with Skarmory and Dugtrio tend not to have other Heracross checks, so Heracross can sometimes even take the opportunity to set up on Choice-locked Dugtrio after the revenge kill.</p> <p>The Focus Punch variant similarly belongs on fast-paced offense, but without Magneton. It appreciates teammates that can similarly lure and mount a lot of pressure on Skarmory, such as Choice Band Metagross and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, to take it down in tandem. The availability of more offensive options due to relinquishing the Magneton slot also makes sand removal support less necessary. Substitute + Baton Pass Vaporeon is an interesting partner, for Vaporeon can force in Blissey and pass a 101 HP Substitute out to Heracross, giving Heracross a free opportunity to fire off Focus Punch without predicting. Vaporeon can also turn the momentum on Celebi by hitting it hard with Ice Beam and bringing Heracross in on Recover.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Heracross primarily seeks to use its boosted STAB moves to overwhelm the opponent after its most resilient checks such as Skarmory and Gengar have been removed. Megahorn OHKOes Celebi and Claydol, but with the boost from Choice Band, it also OHKOes Tyranitar and bulkless offensive Swampert and threatens to OHKO Blissey. The boost significantly shortens the lifespan of physical walls, allowing Megahorn to 2HKO Metagross and defensive Swampert with certainty and do likewise against defensive Suicune with good odds. Boosted Megahorn's ability to 2HKO Zapdos also allows Heracross to stay in, take a Thunderbolt, and finish off its check. As Megahorn can fall just shy of OHKOing Blissey and Snorlax, Brick Break is run to KO them more reliably. If Magneton is not used on Heracross's team, Heracross can run Focus Punch for a 25% chance to OHKO Skarmory. Rock Slide OHKOes Aerodactyl and Moltres, 2HKOes Salamence, and is likely to OHKO offensive Zapdos. Hidden Power Ghost OHKOes Gengar. The damage output of these boosted coverage moves allows for a high-risk, high-reward play where a prediction is all that is needed to take out a check.</p> <p>An Adamant nature increases the odds that many of Heracross's targets are taken out with one less hit and is the preferred nature because Choice Band Heracross operates in a hit-and-run manner, pivoting in on slower threats and switching out after. However, Jolly allows Heracross to outspeed slower variants of Salamence, Modest Zapdos, and Modest Moltres.</p> <p>Choice Band Heracross gets worn down to low HP pretty frequently, and sometimes the best way to deal with it is to stall it out in sand. Thus, getting the extra power on the last few hits with Swarm can go a long way, OHKOing Aerodactyl, non-defensive Metagross, and bulkless Magneton as well as nearly OHKOing Zapdos and Swampert. Guts can be used to exploit status moves from Blissey and allows Heracross to stay in on Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Heracross prefers support from trappers to remove its sturdiest checks. Magneton traps Skarmory, letting Heracross drop Focus Punch, and Forretress, which resists Megahorn. Pursuit Tyranitar wears down hovering threats that resist Megahorn such as Gengar, Choice Band Salamence, and Aerodactyl; with some prediction, it also chips Zapdos and Moltres. Porygon2 removes Dugtrio, which can revenge kill Heracross; Porygon2 can get the opportunity to do so when Dugtrio KOes Magneton or Tyranitar.</p> <p>To mitigate the momentum lost from being locked into a move, Choice Band Heracross tends to be used on more balanced teams with defensive backbones compared to its other sets. Porygon2 nullifies most of what Salamence tries to throw at Heracross, though it can be taken out by Choice Band Brick Break with proper prediction. Celebi can force switches with Leech Seed and pivot to Heracross safely through Baton Pass, especially against Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar, either during an expected switch or by utilizing Leech Seed's recovery. Leech Seed's recovery can be important for mitigating damage from sand, which Heracross cannot compensate for due to its lack of Leftovers. Celebi also checks Zapdos. Milotic shrugs off damage from Salamence, Moltres, and Charizard with Recover and can slowly chip Zapdos.</p>"

Unfortunately, both of its STAB types are special, and it only has base 35 Special Attack, meaning Sneasel must use non-STAB moves if it wants to make use of its much higher Attack stat. Sneasel is also exceedingly frail and has five glaring weaknesses, necessitating an immense amount of team support in order for it to function. Even so, Sneasel has perfect neutral coverage in Shadow Ball + Brick Break, and in a metagame dominated by Psychic-types such as Hypno, Solrock, Lunatone, and Grumpig, as well as Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Cradily, and Walrein, perhaps it's not all bad for everyone's favorite icy weasel.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set is more suited to revenge killing than Sneasel's Swords Dance set, making use of moves like Focus Punch and Hidden Power Flying, the latter of which is extremely useful against walls like Hitmontop, Vileplume, and Meganium that Sneasel would otherwise have trouble with. However, Sneasel faces heavy competition as a revenge killer from Persian, which gets STAB on Double-Edge, allowing it to always OHKO Hasty Tentacruel and hit Scyther significantly harder than Sneasel ever could. Substitute and Endure are both options to help Sneasel more safely bring its HP down to the activation range of its Liechi Berry. Focus Punch can be used alongside Substitute as a stronger alternative to Brick Break. Sneasel can also use Substitute in tandem with Toxic to wear down the foe. Quick Attack can be utilized as a priority move that picks off weakened Pokemon. However, Sneasel already has the necessary Speed tier to adequately perform this role, and giving up an important move for Quick Attack is not justifiable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types such as Poliwrath, Primeape, and Hitmontop can easily OHKO Sneasel with their STAB attacks. Hitmonlee and Hitmontop also have access to Mach Punch, which ignores Sneasel's absurd Speed stat. Additionally, Hitmontop's Intimidate softens the incoming attack before Hitmontop revenge kills Sneasel with Mach Punch. Walls such as Blastoise, Hypno, Granbull, and the aforementioned Hitmontop can all pivot into Sneasel easily and 2HKO it back, especially the latter two with their access to Intimidate. Due to its extreme frailty, Sneasel gets easily crushed by Rock-types such as Omastar, Solrock, and Lunatone; burned alive by Fire-types such as Ninetales, Camerupt, and Magmar; swarmed by Bug-types such as Scyther and Pinsir; and hammered by Steel-types such as Aggron.</p>",

Because Shadow Ball and Brick Break do not receive STAB, Double-Edge becomes Sneasel’s strongest attack against targets that are hit neutrally by the first two attacks. Swords Dance boosts Sneasel’s Attack stat by two stages with each use and allows it to perform the role of a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Liechi Berry is Sneasel's best option for a held item, as it is likely to take a massive hit to activate it or use Double-Edge enough to activate it through the recoil.

Maximum Speed and Attack EVs allow Sneasel to outspeed the entire tier and hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature is utilized so that Sneasel can outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Scyther, Manectric, Rapidash, and Electabuzz. Sneasel is hard to use because it's so incredibly frail and cannot be directly switched into basically anything. As such, Sneasel should only be switched in via a slow Baton Pass or after a teammate has fainted so that it can revenge kill the foe. Furthermore, bulky attackers such as Kangaskhan and Lunatone can ease pressure off Sneasel with their ability to take a hit yet still maintain offensive momentum. Spikes setters such as Omastar are incredibly useful for chipping away at the opposing team for Sneasel to clean up later.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Ursaring is the epitome of power, with a whopping base 130 Attack and an excellent ability in Guts. However, its rather lackluster Speed and vulnerability to all forms of residual damage certainly don't do it any favors. It's also rather difficult to switch in on anything other than a predicted switch, a Ghost-type attack, or a status move. However, Ursaring can serve as a potent mid-game wallbreaker with a Swords Dance or Choice Band set and can even clean up late-game with Bulk Up. Above all, it is extremely difficult for the opponent to switch anything in on Ursaring as it deals good damage to almost everything in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ursaring can utilize a RestTalk set for the Guts boost while asleep, but it is inconsistent overall; Ursaring has to forgo a coverage option, doesn't have the bulk, and is walled even harder by Skarmory. Facade, Double-Edge, and Body Slam are other interesting options for an alternate STAB move, but bear in mind that sleep does not boost Facade. Ursaring also has Brick Break and Rock Slide in its movepool, but these are inadvisable as they do not provide any notable coverage; Earthquake OHKOes Tyranitar with either a Choice Band or a Guts boost, and Rock Slide's only possible use is for Aerodactyl, not to mention that it requires Ursaring to give up another coverage move. Counter can work if you try and force Skarmory to attack Ursaring with Drill Peck by showing Focus Punch, which acts as a pseudo-Taunt in that situation.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ursaring is a Pokemon that is incredibly difficult to directly counter; its only real safe switch-ins are Skarmory and Forretress, and even then only to a slight extent. However, the Choice Band set can be defeated with superior prediction, and both boosting sets are vulnerable to simply being outpaced and revenge killed by Pokemon that can hit it adequately hard or super effectively, such as Heracross and Medicham. Choice Band Metagross is also an excellent counter because it will always OHKO in sandstorm with Meteor Mash and resists Return, Ursaring's main STAB option. Ursaring also needs to avoid Choice Band Salamence because of its Intimidate ability and the possible threat of Brick Break.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>This set can be highly effective if used correctly. The premise is simple: switch Ursaring into a status move such as Will-O-Wisp or Toxic and predict switches accordingly. Return is a basic powerful STAB move and hits many opponents very hard. Earthquake hits Pokemon such as Metagross on the switch, while Hidden Power Ghost allows Ursaring to hit Gengar and Dusclops for good damage. Focus Punch takes a massive chunk out of Skarmory switch-ins, but if your team is desperately in need of a sleep absorber, Ursaring can use Sleep Talk in the fourth slot as Guts gives it an Attack boost while asleep. This set should be played aggressively, and a player with good prediction skills will benefit from using it.</p> <p>This set also works decently in the lead slot as it scares away threats such as Gengar, Regice, Snorlax, and many others. The EV spread allows Ursaring to outspeed Vaporeon, Umbreon, and Claydol, making it an excellent switch-in to them as they all often carry Toxic and have no real offensive presence. Ursaring can go slightly faster with an alternate spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe to outspeed all non-Agility variants of Metagross and non-Taunt Skarmory, both of which are prime counters to the bear.</p> <p>Ursaring pairs excellently with Substitute + Baton Pass Zapdos, which resists the Fighting-type attacks that Ursaring doesn't enjoy, scares out Skarmory, and can pass Substitutes to Ursaring or simply dry pass on predicted switches. Like all physically attacking Normal-types, Choice Band Ursaring enjoys Magneton support to remove Skarmory and Forretress.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>As opposed to the hit-and-run approach that the Choice Band set employs, this set aims to break down stall by boosting Attack, and it truly shines at doing so. The basic idea behind the set is to bring it in on a wall such as Blissey or Dusclops, Swords Dance on the switch (usually to Skarmory if you're playing against stall), and choose the appropriate attack. Focus Punch is the preferred move because of its ability to hit Skarmory hard before it Roars. With Guts activated and a Swords Dance boost, Ursaring will almost OHKO the metal bird with Focus Punch. However, Earthquake is also an option for its ability to hit Metagross and Tyranitar, but it leaves Ursaring completely walled by Skarmory. When playing with this set, it is important not to be afraid to stay in and take damage.</p> <p>Bulk is much more important to this set than to the Choice Band one, so that it can switch in and stay in, so a faster EV spread is a poor option. Even the bulkiest of Water-types, Suicune, does not make a safe switch-in as a +2 non-Guts Return will 2HKO it most of the time in sandstorm or with one layer of Spikes.</p> <p>Due to its lack of recovery and the fact that it will probably be taking heavy damage, this set adores Wish support; Jirachi in particular forces Skarmory out and can use the free turn to pass a Wish along. Magneton is not as important a partner for this set as this Ursaring can beat Skarmory itself by Focus Punching on a predicted Roar.</p>"
        },
        "Bulk Up": {
          "description": "<p>This Ursaring plays very similarly to the wallbreaker set, but it can tank hits slightly better and also clean up balanced teams late-game to a certain extent. However, as this set does not hit as hard off the bat, it struggles with Skarmory and bulky Water-types such as Suicune, which will tank its comparatively weaker hits and phaze it away without fear. Return is a powerful STAB move, Hidden Power Ghost offers coverage against Dusclops and other Ghost-types, and Earthquake is preferred as this set does not aim to beat Skarmory itself but to clean up after it has been removed. Earthquake also allows Ursaring to stand a chance against most variations of Metagross after a Bulk Up, although it does help if the opponent's Metagross is weakened in advance. However, Focus Punch is usable if your team does not have the necessary support for the bear.</p> <p>Another issue with this set is that Ursaring is vulnerable to Spikes and sandstorm, which massively lowers its durability. Therefore, Starmie is a great partner as it beats Skarmory and can Rapid Spin away all hazards on the field to aid Ursaring's sweep. Magneton also makes an ideal partner for this set--even more so than others--due to its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and prevent it setting up the Spikes that Ursaring dislikes. Other good teammates for this set include Zapdos, and Jolteon to an extent. Ursaring has surprising mixed bulk that can be utilized with a set such as this.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Piloswine is an undeniably cool Pokemon with a unique typing, but unfortunately those factors do not do it any favors on the battlefield. Having Ice STAB is decent, but Rock STAB would be better when combined with Piloswine's Ground STAB and overall stat spread. Regardless, Piloswine is a veritable tank in the tier, being very hard to OHKO and usually being able to OHKO the foe back with the right move. However, low Speed, a lack of resistances, and a vulnerability to the many Grass-, Fire-, and Water-types in the tier, as well as Hitmonchan, lower Piloswine's general effectiveness. Still, its lack of a Ground-type weakness is nice, and its access to a plethora of moves outside of Earthquake like Roar gives it some utility over its main competition in Graveler.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Similar to the screen lure set, Piloswine can make use of a Substitute + 3 attacks set to protect itself from an attack and possibly KO the opponent in return. However, using a screen not only allows Piloswine to do the same but also supports the rest of its team. Still, Piloswine can make 101 HP Substitutes, and Substitute blocks all status, allowing it to really work its magic against a stall-heavy team where a screen would not. As for other sets, the only one not really mentioned is a RestTalk set. However, Piloswine's lack of resistances makes this set undesirable compared to the tank sets provided above.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best initial switch-ins to Piloswine are bulky Water-types, as they aren't weak to any of the moves that Piloswine carries save for Toxic and can remove Piloswine with a STAB Water move. Dewgong and Pelipper in particular make exceptional switch-ins if they avoid Rock Slide, and Wailord, Whiscash, and Huntail all can make quick work of Piloswine with Surf. Grass-types such as Bellossom, Tangela, and Cacturne resist Earthquake and take little from Piloswine's other physical moves, although they all will take a hefty chunk from Blizzard. Fire-types like Flareon and Charmeleon cannot switch into Piloswine very safely, but they can take it out easily with STAB Fire Blast once in.</p> <p>Hitmonchan easily takes out Piloswine with Sky Uppercut, but it too has a hard time switching directly into Earthquake and dislikes Toxic. Physically defensive Lickitung with Heal Bell is probably the safest switch-in to Piloswine in the tier, although it's massive setup bait for much of the tier and needs to be careful of the screen lure set. In the same vein, Heal Bell Chimecho can switch into most Piloswine easily but needs to be careful of Choice Band-boosted attacks like Double-Edge. Finally, Bulk Up Vigoroth can usually use non-Choice Band Piloswine as setup fodder, but it needs to be careful of Toxic and can get phazed if it doesn't have Encore.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>A strong, STAB Earthquake is the main selling point of this set and should be used at every opportunity with gusto. Rock Slide completes almost perfect coverage alongside Earthquake and takes out Flying-types and Haunter. Ice Beam and Blizzard both get STAB, and even without any investment, they get a really good hit on defensive Tangela and the other Grass-types in the tier without having to reach for the recoil-inducing Double-Edge. That said, Double-Edge is super strong and generally hits the Pokemon that resist or are immune to Earthquake for really good damage, making it a good safe move to use when unsure of what the opponent is planning to do next.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs let Piloswine outspeed minimum Speed Swalot and Relicanth, with the remaining EVs pumped into HP and Attack for bulk and power. A Naughty nature ensures that Ice Beam and Blizzard aren't reduced in power. More Speed can definitely be run, even up to max Speed if overall bulk isn't needed, which gets Piloswine the jump on other major defensive Pokemon like Dewgong, Chimecho, Flareon, and Pelipper.</p> <p>Toxic is an option to cripple the bulky Water-types that are likely to switch into Piloswine, particularly Pelipper. However, with a layer of Spikes on the opposing side of the field, Piloswine cleanly 2HKOes even fully physically defensive Whiscash and isn't OHKOed by Surf in return, assuming the above EV spread. Piloswine tends to draw in Fire-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks, making special walls like Flareon, Kecleon, and Dewgong really important teammates to bring with Piloswine. Venomoth and Flying-types also make good switch-ins to Grass-type attacks, while Grass-types like Roselia and Electric-types like Plusle can scare out most Water-types.</p> <p>Hitmonchan is very dangerous for this set to deal with, making Chimecho, Haunter, and Flying-types important teammates to bring when using Piloswine. Piloswine also makes a really good check to Plusle and Haunter, unlike most of the other Ground- or Rock-types in the tier, due in part to its higher bulk, its immunity to Electric, and the fact that it's not totally destroyed by Grass- or Ice-type attacks. With this fact in mind, Piloswine also makes a good partner to Pokemon especially weak to the aforementioned Pokemon, such as Huntail and Mawile.</p>"

        "Tank": {
          "description": "<p>Piloswine is the epitome of the word \"tank,\" and it really shows its true colors with this set. While not packing as much power as with a Choice Band, this set aims to take attacks and dish them out, spreading and taking as much damage as possible before going down. This set is very flexible thanks to the ability to switch moves, and Piloswine's longevity is truly surprising with just Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>To give an idea of Piloswine's tankishness, with the given EV spread, Piloswine avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Raticate's Return after Protect and easily 2HKOes with Earthquake in return. This set is also less susceptible to special attackers like Plusle and Haunter than most of Piloswine's other sets due to its ability to stall for Leftovers recovery and switch moves to play around those sporting Levitate.</p> <p>Ice Beam and Blizzard do a good amount of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake, as well as to Tangela. Toxic + Protect allows Piloswine to spread residual damage around the opponent's team and stall for Leftovers recovery. However, either can be replaced with Roar, which is an actually highly sought-after move in the tier and allows Piloswine to phaze dangerous setup sweepers like Bulk Up Vigoroth and rack up potential Spikes damage.</p> <p>The Special Attack investment of this set allows Piloswine to OHKO Tangela, offensive Shelgon, and Murkrow with Ice Beam as well as get the 2HKO on Haunter. With the same spread, Blizzard has a chance to OHKO even Pidgeot and ensures the OHKO on Graveler. Brave is the needed nature to make sure Earthquake does enough damage to relevant targets like Swalot, with which Piloswine easily 2HKOes physically defensive variants. All this said, the STAB Ice move and Special Attack investment can be dropped in favor of Rock Slide or Double-Edge with the EVs pumped into Attack instead. However, doing so removes a lot of utility and uniqueness that Piloswine holds by making use of its Ice STAB.</p> <p>Piloswine is a little harder to switch into with this set for defensive Pokemon, as many do not like taking a potential Toxic, but Grass- and Water-type switch-ins will still be the most common. RestTalk Dewgong in particular can switch into this set without much fear, so a teammate that can take it out like Hitmonchan is a must. Flareon, Murkrow, and Haunter make good teammates to capitalize on the opponent's Grass-types and appreciate Piloswine's ability to spread damage around the opposing team, making a few KOs for the latter two in particular easier when Toxic and Spikes damage have been spread around a bit. As always, Hitmonchan is super threatening for Piloswine, making Chimecho a brilliant teammate as well as Poison-types such as Golbat and Swalot.</p>"

The latter two are actually weak to Piloswine's STAB moves, and because of this fact, this set is extremely effective at getting the jump on those Pokemon by using Light Screen as a buffer shield as they switch in and causing them to fail to KO Piloswine while it easily KOes back with the appropriate move. Piloswine also lures in Hitmonchan too, making Reflect a decent alternative to Light Screen, although Piloswine will only be doing 72.3 - 85.5% to 4/0 Hitmonchan with Earthquake and the given EV spread.</p> <p>Screen support in general is great in NU. To give an idea of its effectiveness, Modest Huntail can't even OHKO Piloswine with Surf in the rain with Light Screen up, while Piloswine in return can rack up damage with Toxic or Earthquake or safely switch out to a teammate like Plusle to take it head on. The possibilities are truly endless with this set, allowing Piloswine to tank attacks from Pokemon it otherwise fears, such as Flareon, Tangela, and Roselia, and really turn the tables on them, with the only caveat being you must be able to predict and set up the Light Screen on the switch. The combination of a screen and Roar also makes Piloswine arguably the best phazer in the tier, for five turns at a time anyway, and prevents really dangerous threats from being able to use Piloswine as setup bait.</p> <p>The EV spread includes Special Attack investment to allow Piloswine to OHKO Shelgon, Tangela, and Murkrow with Ice Beam and OHKO Pidgeot and Graveler with Blizzard. Blizzard also allows Piloswine to 2HKO bulky Sunny Day Bellossom after Spikes while only taking roughly ~60% in return from Solar Beam from behind a Light Screen.</p> <p>Plusle absolutely adores this set as a teammate, as Piloswine most commonly lures in Water-types, and from behind a Light Screen Plusle can switch in especially easily and force the foe out or KO it with its STAB Thunderbolt. Pokemon that enjoy Fire- or Grass-types out of the way make the best possible teammates for this set, as they can then capitalize on their absence and hopefully sweep. Good examples of these include Mawile, Kingler, Dragon Dance Pupitar, and frail sweepers like Pikachu.</p> <p>Pokemon that can make use of the screen support, particularly setup sweepers, make especially good teammates as well. Bulk Up Vigoroth, Swords Dance Tropius, and weather sweepers like Huntail and Bellossom are all exceptionally dangerous when protected by the right screen. As a bonus, the weather sweepers in particular have an easy time switching into the attacks that are normally directed at Piloswine too. Finally, Hitmonchan is as always a threat to this set, and while rare, it could also be carrying Brick Break, making a teammate that can take it out like Chimecho or Pidgeot essential to this set's success.</p>"

Octillery is also the best recipient of stat boosts via Baton Pass in the tier thanks to its ability Suction Cups, which prevents foes from dealing with it by phazing it, and it can also utilize Thunder Wave to help make up for its poor Speed. Unfortunately, because of said meager Speed, Octillery heavily struggles against faster foes like Haunter, Plusle, and Pikachu if it lacks Speed boosts or doesn't get the chance to paralyze them. Additionally, Octillery is outclassed both offensively and defensively by Wailord and Dewgong due to its poor bulk and inability to get past checks with utility moves like Self-Destruct and Encore.</p>",

Do note, however, that Octillery will serve as an even worse switch-in to resisted attacks. A Lum Berry can be utilized on the Baton Pass-based set to make Octillery less vulnerable to status, especially if it isn't being Baton Passed a Substitute.

Hidden Power Electric rounds out Octillery's coverage by hitting Water-types like Wailord, Dewgong, and Pelipper super effectively, although Hidden Power Grass works as an alternative to target Relicanth as opposed to Pelipper for 4x super effective damage. Thunder Wave helps make up for Octillery's poor Speed and lets it support its team by crippling faster Pokemon like Golbat and Pidgeot. 84 Speed EVs let Octillery outspeed Relicanth, while the remaining EVs with a Modest nature make Octillery stronger and bulkier. Leftovers provides Octillery with useful recovery so it can pivot into certain attacks like Flareon's Flamethrower and Wailord's Surf more frequently, although Lum Berry is a great option if Octillery is being used as a lead to improve its matchup against Venomoth. Suction Cups is mostly useless, although it's nice to prevent the foe from phazing Octillery to rack up Spikes damage.</p> <p>If Octillery isn't being used as a lead, it is ideal to bring it in on weak, resisted attacks such as Flareon's Flamethrower and Wailord's Surf to preserve its HP. Once on the field, the goal should be to take advantage of Octillery's great coverage to hit predicted switch-ins such as Roselia and Pelipper with the appropriate coverage move. If the opponent has a dedicated special wall like Kecleon or Vigoroth, paralyzing it with Thunder Wave or simply switching out to a check is ideal. When Octillery is in the lead slot, the main goal will be to force out opposing leads with Octillery's positive matchup against them to reveal other members and get hard hits off early-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Pupitar, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Haunter appreciate Octillery's wallbreaking support enabling them to clean late-game more effectively. Because Octillery isn't as reliable as other Water-types at switching into Fire- and Water-type attacks, Pokemon like Flareon and Roselia are useful to provide secondary switch-ins to such attacks. Flareon can also bring Octillery in against Pokemon like Torkoal and Relicanth with Baton Pass, Roselia's Spikes help support Octillery's wallbreaking, and both can switch into Grass-type attacks. Normal- and Flying-types such as Raticate, Pidgeot, and Murkrow benefit from Octillery pressuring Rock- and Steel-types; in return, they help against special walls.</p>"

Hidden Power Electric gives Octillery a way to threaten Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong. Substitute shields Octillery from status moves and critical hits. 144 Speed EVs enable Octillery to outspeed Raticate after two Speed boosts, while the remaining EVs with a Modest nature improve its bulk and attacking power.

Delcatty gives Octillery its Special Attack and Special Defense boosts and can even pass Wish in case Octillery is entering a field with Spikes.

Additionally, Delibird benefits from the ability to switch moves against Flying-resistant foes like Rhyhorn and Magnemite. Quick Attack picks off frail fast attackers like Abra and Salac Berry users like Beedrill. However, Delibird struggles to fit it over any of its coverage moves without becoming less effective as a wallbreaker, and the accuracy nerf applied by Hustle can lead Delibird to totally flop when trying to finish off dangerous foes like Ponyta and Elekid. Focus Punch can deal a huge chunk of damage to Corsola as it switches in, but this requires great prediction, usually getting Delibird behind a Substitute, and for the move not to miss because of Hustle. Additionally, giving up Hidden Power Ground or Ice Beam for Focus Punch makes Delibird overly prediction-reliant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Delibird cannot 2HKO Corsola, even with Hidden Power Ground, and Corsola can 2HKO Delibird or just use it as setup fodder. Clamperl and Seaking are generally 3HKOed by Delibird's Aerial Ace and can OHKO Delibird outright. Defensive Wartortle can take repeated hits from Delibird and 2HKO it with Surf, and offensive variants can even OHKO Delibird.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Aipom can take one attack from Delibird and OHKO it with a Normal-type move. Ponyta, Quilava, Elekid, and Voltorb can all switch into both Aerial Ace and Ice Beam and threaten to OHKO Delibird, but only Quilava can take Hidden Power Ground. Volbeat can switch into anything but Aerial Ace and proceed to KO Delibird with Double-Edge. Abra can OHKO Delibird outright, but it can only switch into a predicted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types</strong>: Castform, Delcatty, and Porygon are not 2HKOed by Delibird, and they threaten to 2HKO it themselves given its terrible bulk. Delcatty and Porygon outright wall Delibird thanks to their access to reliable recovery. Defensive Noctowl can 2HKO Delibird and avoid a 2HKO, while offensive Noctowl can OHKO Delibird. However, Noctowl can be overwhelmed if Delibird sets up a Substitute as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Mightyena</strong>: Intimidate softening Aerial Ace makes Mightyena a workable stop-gap to Delibird, though it doesn't work behind Substitute.

Aerial Ace is Delibird's most reliable strong attack by circumventing the accuracy nerf of Hustle, and it threatens Bug-types such as Ariados, Beedrill, and Dustox. Ice Beam best complements Aerial Ace by threatening physically bulky Pokemon like Onix, Koffing, and Rhyhorn. Hidden Power Ground covers Electric-types like Chinchou, Magnemite, and Flaaffy, and it's Delibird's strongest attack against Corsola. 68 Special Attack EVs let Delibird 2HKO Koffing and Lileep. Delibird hardly has the bulk to make its choice of defense-lowering nature matter, but a Hasty nature at least gives Delibird an 88.3% chance to avoid a 2HKO from physically defensive Mightyena's Crunch. A Naive nature keeps it out of range of Doduo's Quick Attack slightly better, which is helpful when Delibird risks putting itself into range of Quick Attack when using Substitute.</p> <p>Offense teams benefit from Delibird's presence as an especially threatening wallbreaker, but balance teams can make up for Delibird's lack of defensive value by relying on bulkier Pokemon to get it into good positions. Bulky Water-types like Wartortle and Seaking can intercept fast Fire-types for Delibird, while Delibird threatens Grass-types for them. Bulky Normal-types like Castform and Porygon can similarly check Ponyta and Quilava, and they also have good matchups against the fast Electric-types, Elekid and Voltorb. Delcatty is an especially good bulky Normal-type to pair with Delibird, as it can pivot it in safely with Baton Pass. Electric-types like Flaaffy and Chinchou threaten bulky Water-types that would check Delibird, while Delibird pressures bulky Grass-types like Gloom and Tropius that would wall its Electric-type partners. Bulky Normal-types, Electric-types, and Gloom can all support Delibird by spreading paralysis, enabling Delibird to outrun and dispose of fast, frail offensive threats. Delibird's unable to break through Corsola and other bulky Water-types like Seaking and Wartortle on its own, so it depends on support against them, which can include Gloom, Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Thunderbolt variants of Porygon.</p>"

Skarmory's utility movepool allows it to fill multiple roles by offering Spikes support, phazing, and Taunt backed up by a decent Speed tier. However, Skarmory's Flying typing makes it even more susceptible to being trapped by Magneton than Forretress, and it takes neutral damage from Latios's, Latias's, and Mewtwo's Ice Beam.

Its Steel / Flying typing is also perfect for its role as a wall, leaving it without any physical weaknesses and with a resistance to all but two physically attacking types, namely Rock and Fighting. However, two exploitable weaknesses to specially attacking types make it vulnerable to Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Despite this, Skarmory is an incredible Pokemon that should always be considered.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest can be used, allowing Skarmory to cure itself of status and regain health at the cost of being inactive for two sleep turns. Soft Sand on the offensive Spikes set can be used to have a better chance to OHKO bulky Magneton, though Skarmory will miss out on recovery from Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skarmory is quite easy to counter due to its lack of offensive presence and low Special Defense. Magneton is the best counter to Skarmory; thanks to Magnet Pull, it can switch in, trap Skarmory, and KO it with Thunderbolt. It is to be emphasized that Timid or bulky Magneton variants are more reliable at trapping offensive Spikes Skarmory; however, Timid Magneton has a lower chance to OHKO standard Skarmory with full investment in special bulk. Any decently strong special attacker with a Fire- or Electric-type move can scare Skarmory, especially if it is not concerned about Toxic or Drill Peck, such as Jirachi.</p> <p>Most of the time, the main issue for the opposing team is dealing with Spikes set by Skarmory.

While Rapid Spin is not commonly found on offensive teams, they usually have at least five members that can deal with Skarmory. As offensive teams usually don't switch enough for Spikes damage to really rack up, it may be fine for them if there are one or two layers of Spikes on their side.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes allows Skarmory to apply residual damage to the opposing team and is the primary reason to use it. Roar is one of the main reasons to use Skarmory over other Spikers because most of the time it prevents Skarmory from being setup bait for foes. It also allows Skarmory to take advantage of Spikes by phazing foes and racking up residual damage. Protect gives Skarmory an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and is quite effective due to Skarmory's immunity to Toxic, Sandstorm damage, and Spikes. It also gives Skarmory a method of scouting for unexpected Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Taunt is an option that allows Skarmory to stop opposing Spikers from laying Spikes. Toxic allows Skarmory to threaten spinners such as Cloyster and non-Refresh Claydol, both of which can switch in and remove Spikes without fear. It also allows Skarmory to threaten many other Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Swampert without Refresh, Zapdos, Salamence, Suicune, Jolteon, and Porygon2. Furthermore, it pairs great with Protect to apply more damage to the foe; even defensive Starmie has trouble with Toxic + Protect Skarmory. Drill Peck is an option that allows Skarmory to do a lot of damage to Fighting-types such as Heracross, prevent Gengar from switching in for free, and hurt Taunt Gyarados. It also prevents Refresh Claydol and Forretress from regaining health with Leftovers against Skarmory. Drill Peck can also be used alongside Toxic in place of Protect at the cost of recovery and scouting ability.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Skarmory's special bulk. This allows Skarmory to take advantage of weak special attackers such as defensive Swampert with ease. It also gives it a better chance to survive Magneton's Thunderbolt. If Taunt is used, it is recommended to run a decent amount of Speed investment to outspeed opposing Skarmory.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded walls and makes powerful attackers such as Tyranitar more difficult to switch into. Blissey forms the fearsome SkarmBliss core with Skarmory: Blissey can handle special attackers that trouble Skarmory, while Skarmory can handle physical attackers such as Snorlax that take advantage of Blissey. Gengar not only takes advantage of Skarmory's Spikes but also has the added benefit of being able to block Rapid Spin, which makes it a great teammate. Swampert can back Skarmory up as a physical wall and run Roar to utilize Spikes even better. Fast sweepers, such as offensive Starmie and Aerodactyl, appreciate Spikes wearing down the opponent's team so that they can clean late-game. Pokemon such as Jolteon that force a lot of switches are also great with Spikes support, as the switches they force become much more potent with the additional residual damage. Dugtrio or Hidden Power Fire Magneton can trap opposing Magneton, which can often be disastrous for teams that rely on Magneton to check Skarmory. At the very least, they can revenge kill Magneton after it has trapped Skarmory, making a one-for-one trade.</p>"

Taunt shuts down opposing Skarmory and helps Skarmory beat Blissey without a Fire-type move. Roar can almost always force out setup sweepers that try to set up on Skarmory and can rack up residual damage as well.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Skarmory's Attack and Speed, which enables it to outspeed Modest Magneton that has Hidden Power Fire and OHKO it with Hidden Power Ground.

Jolteon absorbs Electric-type attacks for Skarmory, and its STAB Thunderbolt synergizes well with Spikes because Pokemon immune to Spikes are often vulnerable to Electric-type attacks. Gengar acts as a spinblocker for Spikes from Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Dark-, Ghost-, and Psychic-type attacks for Gengar. Offensive Swampert can be an excellent glue, while Skarmory can switch into Grass-type attacks for Swampert. Bulky Tyranitar resists Fire-type attacks and can take some Electric-type attacks for Skarmory, and Spikes support makes it harder for foes to switch into its STAB Rock Slide. Moltres can pivot into Fire-type moves for Skarmory and run Roar to better utilize Spikes.

However, Houndoom is capable of filling an often pivotal role: Pursuit-trapping the spinblocker Gengar while also providing a consistent switch-in to Celebi and Superachi with its immunity to Psychic, resistance to Grass, and powerful Fire Blast. Its ability to remove Gengar is especially significant, as it allows for the likes of Forretress and Cloyster to successfully Rapid Spin with greater ease. Pursuit also helps open up a sweep from the likes of Earthquake Curselax and allows Explosion to be used with less fear.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest is workable on Houndoom, as Early Bird halves its sleep duration. This markedly improves Houndoom's longevity; however, it can be dangerous as a sleeping Houndoom is easy Dugtrio prey—be sure to scout. Beat Up can work on Houndoom if you have a team heavy on physical attackers, as it has the potential to 2HKO the likes of Calm Mind Blissey. However, in doing this you often sacrifice coverage or status, and if your team is physically strong enough for Beat Up, then it shouldn't have problems with the special sponges. If you do use it, though, be sure to use nicknames so as not to prematurely reveal your team! Houndoom can exchange Early Bird for Flash Fire in order to get a boost off a predicted Fire attack, but it loses the ability to wake up more quickly from the likes of Gengar's Hypnosis and also gains a counter in Porygon2. Houndoom can potentially use a SunnyBeam set to clean up late-game, but it is generally far too slow to sweep, and this defies its main purpose as a Pursuit trapper. Sleep Talk without Rest is decent, due to the popularity of Hypnosis Gengar against Pursuit users, especially if you have no sleep absorber; however, it can be somewhat of a waste of a moveslot in a lot of cases.</p> <p>Houndoom can use Counter alongside Will-O-Wisp, the idea behind the set being to catch Tyranitar or Snorlax on the switch-in with Will-O-Wisp and then survive an unboosted burnt Rock Slide or Earthquake to Counter it back for the KO. It can also do the same against burnt Aerodactyl's Rock Slide with 52 HP and 48 Defense EVs. However, in most cases you are better off switching to a defensive Pokemon such as Swampert or Skarmory, who can easily take these attacks and do damage or set up Spikes in return, because Tyranitar and Aerodactyl nearly always have no recovery or way to remove status and Snorlax sometimes will not Rest either.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Being a specially oriented, frail Fire-type, Houndoom is countered by a vast array of Pokemon. The special walls Snorlax and Blissey easily defeat it, sponging Fire Blasts merrily while either statusing Houndoom or just bashing away at it. Non-Rest Snorlax needs to watch out for Will-O-Wisp though, as this can cripple it and remove its offensive presence. Milotic and Suicune can switch into Houndoom repeatedly and threaten it with STAB super effective Surfs. Milotic is especially notable as it loves to absorb Will-O-Wisp thanks to its Marvel Scale ability. It also has instant recovery, unlike Suicune, which is forced to use Rest. However, Milotic must watch out for Toxic, as this will greatly decrease its longevity.</p> <p>Dugtrio can trap and OHKO with Earthquake if brought in on a predicted switch or when Houndoom has just made a kill. However, one must remember that it cannot switch in on an awake Houndoom without the heavy risk of an OHKO from Fire Blast. Tyranitar, Salamence, Aerodactyl, Flygon, and Gyarados are all in the same boat when it comes to Houndoom: they are all fairly decent answers to it, resisting Fire moves and KOing back, but being physical attackers without a way to remove status, none of them can deal well with a Will-O-Wisp burn. RestTalk Zapdos can deal with Houndoom outside of sand or if it has Flamethrower instead of Fire Blast.</p>",

Fire Blast is generally the better choice for the next slot, as Flamethrower can fail to OHKO the likes of Metagross with some HP investment. Crunch is the primary choice for the third slot, as the threat of Pursuit often dissuades Gengar from switching out and it can land an OHKO on any brazen enough to stay in. Crunch can also actively threaten the rarer Dusclops, which can weaken Houndoom if it only has Pursuit. Hidden Power Grass can also fill the third slot to take a huge chunk out of Swampert and dent other Water-types. Finally, Hidden Power Ice can take out Salamence and Flygon, as Houndoom outspeeds their standard sets. The fourth slot can be filled by one of two status moves, namely Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. Will-O-Wisp is better against physical attackers such as Gyarados, Flygon, Tyranitar, Aerodactyl, Utilitylax, and Salamence, while Toxic cripples non-Rest Swampert and Milotic, and is also better in last-Pokemon situations.</p> <p>The EVs given hit 300 Speed, beating all standard Salamence and Flygon. If using Hidden Power Ice, you should drop Houndoom's Attack and Defense IVs to 30 as opposed to dropping its Speed IV. 56 HP gives a total divisible by 16 for optimal Leftovers gain. Maximum Special Attack is used rather than significant defensive investment because Houndoom is painfully frail and unlikely to stay around for a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>Houndoom is a useful partner for the Spikes-laying spinners Forretress and Cloyster, as the pair have difficulty successfully executing a spin against more defensive Gengar and Dusclops in Cloyster's case and any Ghost-type whatsoever in Forretress's. With spinblockers out of the way, both Forretress and Cloyster will be able to more effectively keep Spikes off your side of the field. Houndoom also synergizes very well with Gengar, being immune to Psychic-type moves and resisting Ghost- and Dark-type moves, whilst Gengar is immune to Fighting- and Ground-type moves and can help Houndoom's Spikes-using partners keep their entry hazards up. Roar also works very well in conjunction with this combination of Pokemon to take advantage of Spikes to their fullest. However, this can be a dangerous strategy if the opponent has Dugtrio. Houndoom also enjoys support from Pokemon that are able to switch into bulky Water-types, such as RestTalk Zapdos and Celebi. Zapdos is useful in that it can absorb Gengar's Hypnosis, which can put Houndoom out of commission for a while, and also does not share a weakness to Dugtrio. However, Celebi also checks Snorlax and Blissey with the combination of Leech Seed and Calm Mind.</p>"

Its good bulk and defensive typing allow it to consistently set up Rain Dance. This makes it a good cleaner, especially against frailer offensive teams. Compared to offensive Starmie, it outspeeds more Pokemon when rain is active  and has more bulk, which lets it offensively check physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Salamence, and Aerodactyl. It also outspeeds many notable Pokemon that offensive Suicune does not like Zapdos and Gengar. Additionally, the threat of Kingdra can scare frailer offensive teams into sacrificing important special checks like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Snorlax to prevent it from sweeping, enabling specially offensive partners like Suicune, Zapdos, Jirachi, and Celebi.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Kingdra cannot boost its power outside of Rain Dance and has poor coverage. As such, it struggles to deal with special walls and  Pokemon that resist Water. Notably, it is completely walled by Blissey, specially defensive Jirachi and Celebi,  and common bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune. Explosion users such as Metagross, Gengar, and Forretress can also check it in a pinch if they are healthy. Finally, Kingdra's sweep can also be neutered by status and Tyranitar's Sand Stream. It also faces stiff competition from offensive Starmie and Suicune. The former naturally outspeeds most Pokemon, has better coverage, and has access to Rapid Spin. The latter has far more wallbreaking power thanks to Calm Mind. Kingdra isn't seen often due to the above reasons, but it is a formidable threat if given the right support.</p>",

Mystic Water may be used to improve the odds to OHKO bulkless Zapdos and some Metagross sets with rain-boosted Hydro Pump. 188 Speed EVs may be used to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Claydol and Timid Vaporeon. Maximum Speed EVs may be used to Speed tie with Heracross and offensive Suicune, although this is rarely ever useful, and the bulk drop required to meet these Speed benchmarks is noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey can stomach any hit from Kingdra and retaliate with Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Seismic Toss. However, it does have to beware Kingdra's frequent teammate Dugtrio, which can trap and 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can come in after Kingdra gets a KO and swap Kingdra's rain for sand, cutting its sweep short. However, it loses 1v1 to Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Suicune</strong>: Suicune can come in on any of Kingdra's attacks and set up on it with Calm Mind.

However, Subsitute + Petaya Berry variants can break through it.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Users</strong>: If healthy, Explosion users like bulky Metagross, Cloyster, and Forretress can take a hit and OHKO non-Substitute variants of Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Non Lum Berry Kingdra is vulnerable to Thunder Wave from Jolteon and Zapdos while setting up. This ruins its Speed and stops it from sweeping most of the time. Toxic from Skarmory, Swampert etc. can also cut a potential sweep short, especially in conjunction with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Protect Users</strong>: Protect can be used to stall out rain turns. Once rain runs out, Kingdra becomes far less threatening.

However, Hydro Pump hits some notable benchmarks like OHKOing bulkless Tyranitar outside of rain and having a chance to OHKO bulkless Zapdos and Jolteon in rain. Ice Beam hits Salamence, Celebi, Flygon, and Venusaur. Hidden Power Grass cleanly 2HKOes defensive Swampert without risking a Hydro Pump miss and 2HKOes  offensive Starmie. Hidden Power Electric hits Gyarados hard. Toxic cripples Suicune and is also useful for chipping Blissey into Dugtrio range, forcing it out to let Kingdra damage another Pokemon. This also means that your momentum doesn't come to dead stop upon Blissey coming in. Substitute lets Kingdra avoid status, especially from Zapdos, Jolteon, Skarmory, and Swampert. It can also be used to avoid Explosion, especially from Metagross and Gengar,  and take advantage of opponents using Protect or sacrificing weakened Pokemon to stall out rain turns. 152 Speed EVs allow Kingdra to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, and 104 HP EVs let it survive Salamence's Dragon Claw. Trading Speed for additional bulk is perfectly fine as well, as Kingdra still outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in rain even with no investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send Kingdra in late-game after special walls like Blissey and Snorlax have been removed or heavily chipped and preferably after Tyranitar has been KOed. Beware of paralysis or poison while setting up if lacking Lum Berry. Kingdra can set up on most Pokemon that don't have Explosion or a super effective attack on it that it can threaten back. If it's supporting Substitute + Calm Mind (SubCM) Suicune against a defensive team that Kingdra is unlikely to sweep against, it can be used to clear weather for Suicune's benefit with Rain Dance. Kingdra often forces in passive special walls like Blissey and bulky Water-types like Milotic. These can be taken advantage of by well-timed double switches to Dugtrio or SubCM users against Blissey and special sweepers like Zapdos, Jirachi, SubCM Suicune, and Raikou against bulky Water-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kingdra mostly fits on offensive teams with Dugtrio and multiple special attackers. Kingdra requires support against special walls like Blissey, specially defensive Jirachi, Celebi, and bulky Water-types like Milotic and Suicune, as these wall it endlessly. It also requires opposing Tyranitar to be KOed before attempting a sweep. There are two main categories of Pokemon that have good synergy with Kingdra: ones that can lure in and KO special walls and bulky Water-types and ones that can take advantage of the passivity of special walls and bulky Water-types to set up.</p> <p>In the category of lures, Dugtrio is an excellent partner as it can trap and 2HKO Blissey, Jirachi, and Celebi. It can also trap and OHKO Tyranitar after some chip damage. Zapdos, especially with Substitute + Baton Pass, can bait special walls like Blissey and pass to Dugtrio to trap them. It can also threaten Milotic and Suicune. Gengar can lure in and use Explosion on Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi, and its Will-O-Wisp can also cripple Snorlax and Regice.  Metagross can bait in and use Explosion on Suicune and Milotic. Regice can lure in Blissey and use Explosion on it. Note that weak Explosion users like Gengar and Regice may require Dugtrio to follow up by trapping and KOing Blissey. Offensive Snorlax can pressure Milotic and Blissey and use Self-Destruct to remove Suicune and Celebi. Curse + Self-Destruct sets can also lure in and take out Metagross and Tyranitar. On the rare occasion where Kingdra comes out before Snorlax does, it can also remove sand and enhance Snorlax's longevity.</p> <p>The category of Pokemon that set up on Kingdra's counters is comprised of Calm Mind users. Substitute + Calm Mind (SubCM) Suicune can set up on Blissey, Jirachi, and Milotic. Kingdra's removal of sand allows Suicune to beat Blissey as long as it comes in first and at full HP. Offensive Suicune also pressures Snorlax, Celebi, Jirachi, and Regice in general. SubCM and Wish + Calm Mind Jirachi can also set up on Kingdra's counters, especially Milotic, Blissey, and Regice. Offensive Jirachi also lures in and chips Kingdra checks like Tyranitar and Snorlax.</p> <p>As with any specially offensive Pokemon, Kingdra appreciates Calm Mind + Baton Pass support from Celebi, which allows it to secure crucial OHKOs on Metagross, bulkless Zapdos, and Skarmory with Hydro Pump in rain. This setup also helps Kingdra to break through some of its soft checks like Jirachi, Celebi, and offensive Suicune (if running Hidden Power Grass or Electric). The pairing with Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is not wasted even in the presence of a sturdy wall like Blissey or Milotic, as Celebi can exploit their passivity to set up and pass to more appropriate targets like Jirachi and Zapdos. In conjunction with using partners that break special walls, one can also pair Kingdra with Pokemon that are strong against the entire stall matchup. Bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar is very strong against Suicune or Milotic + Blissey cores, as they tend to come with flimsy Tyranitar checks like Claydol and Dugtrio. Claydol removes Spikes, which are commonly laid by Skarmory after a Dugtrio trap, keeping Kingdra's natural bulk intact. It also checks Zapdos and Tyranitar, which Kingdra teams typically struggle with, and can lure and remove bulky Water-types with Explosion as well.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Donphan's main advantage over Claydol, Starmie, and other Rapid Spin users is its ability to actually hurt the most common spinblocker: Dusclops. However, Donphan faces serious problems in a lack of a reliable recovery move, as well as the fact that it's hurt by the Spikes it's coming in to spin. It also has trouble with poison status, which Starmie can shrug off thanks to Natural Cure. While Donphan makes an excellent Dragon Dance Tyranitar counter, it has some troubles with TyraniBoah variants. All in all, it is a solid Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter is a nice surprise, but Donphan won't be taking much physical damage anyway, and does enough damage to Tyranitar with STAB Earthquake. Body Slam can cause paralysis, but that's about it. The Rapid Spin set can use Substitute in place of Rest to beat Dusclops one-on-one and to ease prediction, but Donphan will be worn down much more quickly. Toxic can be used to cripple Swampert and other Waters that often switch in on Donphan.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Donphan falls to any special attack; the trick is to switch your special attacker in without it dying to Donphan's powerful attacks. Bulky Water-types and Celebi make solid counters to the defensive set, but the Choice Band do can serious damage to almost all of them. Skarmory and Flygon fare well against the Choice Band, and prediction in general will usually work against it.</p>",

        "Tank": {
          "description": "<p>Donphan is a typical physical tank and spinner. Switch it into one of the many physical attackers it can handle, then fire off attacks or use Rapid Spin. Thanks to its high base Attack stat and powerful STAB Earthquake, Donphan's damage output is a lot higher than almost every physical wall in OU. Hidden Power Rock is generally superior to Rock Slide because Donphan is too slow to take advantage of the flinch chance, and Hidden Power Rock does more damage on average. Additionally, Hidden Power Rock has more PP; this can be quite useful when facing a stall team, which is when Rapid Spin Donphan really shines. While Donphan is one of the few good users of Rapid Spin, it can also use Roar to phaze Pokemon such as Snorlax, Salamence, and Ninjask.</p> <p>You'll generally want to maximize Donphan's HP and invest fairly equally into its Attack and Defense. 24 Speed EVs allow Donphan to outspeed Relaxed Swampert, but if you aren't worried about the mudfish, you can dump the EVs into Attack or Defense instead.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>This set is useful for multiple reasons. The first is that as long as your opponent packs a Ghost, such as Dusclops or Gengar, standard Donphan won't be able to Rapid Spin. With a Choice Band, however, Donphan can 2HKO Dusclops with Earthquake and Gengar with Rock Slide. Second, Donphan has a horrible typing, as far as special resistances go, in addition to an equally bad Special Defense stat. It will therefore have to either OHKO the incoming special attacker or switch out; Choice Band perfectly suits this sort of hit-and-run style of play. The final reason is sheer surprise: Donphan OHKOes Celebi with Hidden Power Bug, for instance, and 2HKOes all bulky Waters bar Suicune with Earthquake. Hidden Power Ghost can be used over Hidden Power Bug to OHKO Gengar and still do some damage to Celebi.</p> <p>Choice Band Donphan needs a bit more Attack than its Rapid Spin counterpart does. The remaining EVs are split between HP and Defense for maximum physical survivability.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Porygon2's main function is trapping Dugtrio to allow grounded attackers to shine. Its ability, Trace, also gives it cool tricks such as blanking Claydol's Earthquake, absorbing Jolteon's Thunderbolt, and stealing Natural Cure. Furthermore, thanks to great bulk, solid Special Attack, and BoltBeam coverage, Porygon2 is able to counter dangerous sweepers such as Salamence and Gyarados. However, Porygon2 is usually the sole Pokemon with no pace on offensive teams, so it can be exploited by setup attackers such as Curse Snorlax and Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rain Dance can be used to clear sand for Pokemon such as Salac Berry Heracross. Hidden Power Fire does significant damage to Forretress and hits Metagross. Hidden Power Fighting pressures Tyranitar. Sharpen can be used to set up on Dugtrio and attempt to sweep the opposing team with boosted STAB Return. However, it is not useful in matchups where Dugtrio isn't present. Furthermore, even if Porygon2 manages to set up, there are still numerous things that can stop it such as Explosion and Fighting-type moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon like Snorlax, Substitute Jirachi, and Metagross that don't care too much about Porygon2's attacks or status moves are solid counters to it. Curse Snorlax and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi can set up on Porygon2, while Metagross hits it hard with its STAB Meteor Mash. Forretress can lay Spikes on Porygon2 quite easily. Tyranitar does not appreciate Porygon2's status moves, but it can generally do great damage to Porygon2, especially if it can hit Porygon2 with Focus Punch. Additionally, although Dragon Dance Tyranitar is not a check to Porygon2, it can set up on it Porygon2 while avoiding status with Lum Berry or Taunt, which is dangerous because opposing players will aim to use Porygon2 as setup fodder when it's used on offensive teams with frail defensive backbones. Blissey is easily forced out by Toxic, but it can use Toxic, Thunder Wave, or the rare Sing to make Porygon2 rather useless. Suicune takes solid damage from Porygon2's Thunderbolt or Thunder when its Special Defense isn't boosted, but if it is, Suicune can set up on Porygon2. Celebi can easily pivot in, shrug off damage by using Recover, and switch out to prevent status from crippling its teammate unless Porygon2 predicts the switch. Furthermore, Baton Pass + Calm Mind or Swords Dance Celebi can also set up on Porygon2. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Heracross, Machamp, and Hariyama threaten Porygon2 with their STAB moves and don't take much damage from it. Finally, although Porygon2 has potential to remove status by getting Natural Cure via Trace from Pokemon such as Blissey and Starmie, it is otherwise quite afraid of status, which severely hinders its ability to do its job.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover makes it hard to wear down Porygon2. Ice Beam lets Porygon2 take on Pokemon such as Dugtrio, Salamence, and Flygon. Thunderbolt or Thunder does some damage to Skarmory and turns Porygon2 into one of the best Gyarados counters in ADV OU. While the raw power and paralysis rate of Thunder can be helpful, the accuracy of Thunderbolt makes it more reliable. Alternatively, Toxic hits common targets such as Tyranitar. Thunder Wave cripples threats like Jirachi, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. Using a set with double status is a viable option, because an Electric-type attacking move is not very useful on teams with Magneton.</p> <p>The physical bulk investment allows Porygon2 to avoid being 2HKOed by Adamant Dugtrio's Earthquake in sand, which is important because Porygon2 cannot guarantee an OHKO on Dugtrio with Ice Beam. A more offensive spread can be used as well. For example, an EV spread of 252 HP / 192 Def / 64 SpA with a Modest nature allows Porygon2 to guarantee an OHKO on 8 HP / 40 SpD Dugtrio with Ice Beam. However, this comes with the risk of being worn down by Pokemon such as Salamence and Aerodactyl more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Porygon2 fits on Calm Mind spam teams, where it traps Dugtrio for key threats such as offensive Celebi, Jirachi, and the rare Raikou. Dugtrio itself appreciates opposing Dugtrio being removed too, because it can use Hidden Power Bug and Aerial Ace without worrying about being revenge trapped. The combination of Porygon2 and Dugtrio also checks Salamence, Tyranitar, and Flygon, allowing a team to use a more offensive check to them like Suicune. Meanwhile, with support from Porygon2, Heracross, Tyranitar, Magneton, Starmie, and offensive Swampert no longer worry about being trapped by Dugtrio. In return, they can deal with Porygon2's counters such as Snorlax, Metagross, and Jirachi.</p>"

Split the rest in Attack and HP so he'll survive and get more from Leftovers. For the Calm Mind set worry more about Special Attack and Speed over everything else, maybe a little in HP too.

Use Extreme Speed in this mode of play: it helps against the likes of Rayquaza. As Smeargle's ally uses Explosion or Self-Destruct, Smeargle should Endure the hit. Next, send in a Pokemon that has Fake Out--Jynx is preferred, but Persian works as well. If one enemy is faster than your Fake Out user, Spore that one and target the other with Fake Out; otherwise, Spore the Pokemon less likely to be carrying a Lum Berry (as there is Item Clause, only one Lum Berry is allowed per team).

          "description": "<p>The highlight of this set is Focus Punch backed by 176 Attack EVs which allows Elekid to beat Diglett as long as Elekid is behind a Substitute. This can be the key to victory in some battles, as players will often send Diglett in on Elekid even when Elekid is behind a Substitute. This is because specially defensive Diglett, the most common Diglett set, will always beat Elekid barring a critical hit or freeze from Ice Punch. 80 Special Attack EVs are used to boost Thunderbolt's damage as well as to ensure a clean 2HKO on Porygon without triggering its Sitrus Berry by using Thunderbolt then Focus Punch. Thunder Wave has great utility and gives Elekid opportunities to fish for the opponent to be fully paralyzed, making it much easier to pull off a Focus Punch. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass in combination with Thunderbolt allows it to beat common Pokemon such as Chinchou and Wailmer, as well as the more niche Onix, and is worth considering if its team already has paralysis support elsewhere.</p> <p>The two strengths of the SubPunch set are its ability to take out Diglett and its ability to spread paralysis, but it still has some weaknesses to cover. Slow Pokemon like Cubone and setup sweepers like Bagon and Larvitar that can take advantage of the paralysis Elekid spreads to the opposing team are good partners. As previously mentioned, without Hidden Power Grass, this set really struggles with Chinchou and Wailmer. A Pokemon that can handle both of them like Staryu or Porygon makes a good partner for Elekid. Elekid is also still vulnerable to Trapinch and Cubone, so a strong Water-type like Wailmer, Staryu, or Chinchou that can revenge kill Ground-types is a good idea too. Porygon is another good teammate for Elekid, as it can counter-trap and eliminate Trapinch and has a good matchup versus Cubone.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Blissey is incredibly specially bulky and has no special weaknesses, making it a fantastic general purpose special wall. Its options for team support are also superb, as it possesses one of the most valuable support moves in the tier, Heal Bell, plus moves such as Wish and Toxic. Blissey's physical bulk is surprisingly acceptable, but it still leaves it weak to the strong physical attackers in the tier, such as Deoxys-A and Groudon.</p> <p>Unfortunately, its offensive presence is minimal, forcing it to rely on Toxic and Seismic Toss to pressure foes, which can't significantly threaten foes such as Snorlax and Metagross. This passivity has also given rise to specialist sets from special attackers that can beat it one-on-one by taking advantage of its reliance on Toxic to set up, such as Substitute + Calm Mind Mewtwo and Rest + Calm Mind Kyogre. Furthermore, it has a significant Spikes weakness and lets its users in easily. Finally, it faces competition as a check to Latios and Latias from Snorlax, which has much more offensive presence but somewhat less bulk and longevity.</p> <p>Blissey generally fits best on defensive or balance teams that can provide the significant support it needs and take advantage of the equally significant support it provides.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind / Thunder / Ice Beam / Soft-Boiled set with a Calm nature and a 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 SpD spread is okay against other setup users and can threaten Steel-type switch-ins more effectively, but Blissey cannot threaten most of its switch-ins without Toxic and it offers significantly less team support without Heal Bell. Ice Beam or Thunder can be used over Seismic Toss to hit certain targets—either Groudon and Latios or Kyogre—more effectively, but generally not effectively enough, as Blissey cannot afford to invest in its somewhat weak Special Attack. Finally, Thunder Wave and Sing are status options over Toxic; they lose the important function of beating most setup sweepers but can still be useful. Thunder Wave can help teammates like Kyogre and Groudon fish for full paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status-Blocking Setup Sweepers</strong>: Despite Blissey's incredible special bulk, it will still lose to Substitute + Calm Mind Kyogre and Mewtwo, Rest + Calm Mind Kyogre, and Refresh + Calm Mind Latias; even Mewtwo without Substitute can use Self-Destruct to remove it and create a massive hole in Blissey's team.</p> <p><strong>Spikes Users</strong>: Forretress, Deoxys-D, and Skarmory can significantly impede Blissey's longevity by forcing it to take damage when switching in. All three of these can switch into Blissey, although Deoxys-D must be wary of taking Toxic on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-Immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Metagross and Immunity Snorlax can freely switch in on any move but Seismic Toss and generally aren't significantly harmed by even that; they can hit Blissey hard on its weaker Defense or, in Snorlax's case, set up Curse.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers such as Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Deoxys-A generally can't come in on Blissey easily for fear of Toxic, but they can threaten its weaker Defense significantly if they do.</p> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Wobbuffet and Dugtrio, though rather less common than the above, can generally remove Blissey very effectively—Wobbuffet by PP-stalling it and Dugtrio by hitting it with Earthquake.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blissey's flagship set stonewalls most special attackers, including Kyogre, Mewtwo, Latios, and Latias; it cleanly beats any sets that don't have means to combat status, and it can even force Refresh Latios and Latias to use a move—Recover or Refresh—that a teammate such as Deoxys-A can switch in on to threaten them. Soft-Boiled combined with Natural Cure allows it to continue to take powerful special attacks indefinitely and be resilient to status. Toxic and Seismic Toss together can at least mildly threaten most foes. Heal Bell provides invaluable support to the team, but Wish is a usable alternative. The EVs provided maximize its mixed bulk; a Bold nature can be used over Calm to improve its matchup against physical attackers such as Ho-Oh and support Groudon, but the improved special bulk is generally more important.</p> <p>Instead of Seismic Toss, Light Screen can give a phazer, usually Lugia, a chance to beat setup by protecting it while it phazes, but it worsens Blissey's matchup against Steel-types. Snatch can defeat Latias and Latios by preventing them from removing Toxic with Refresh, as well as cushioning Blissey against Substitute + Calm Mind users by stealing Calm Mind from them. Other possibilities for the moveslot are Psych Up, which can boost its Special Defense alongside Calm Mind users similarly to Snatch, and Icy Wind, which can slow Latias down for Taunt + Toxic Deoxys-D to beat. Flamethrower or Fire Blast can be used instead of Seismic Toss on sun teams to hit Steel-types significantly harder at the cost of being worse against most other targets and being disruptable by Kyogre's rain. It is also possible to run a spread of 180 HP / 76 Def / 252 SpD to avoid being 2HKOed by Kyogre's Hydro Pump in rain even when switching in on a Calm Mind, although this will immensely reduce Blissey's ability to take physical hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey needs ironclad switch-ins to Metagross, Snorlax, Forretress, and Deoxys-A, some way to confront the specialized setup that can beat it, a spinner to remove the Spikes that plague it, some countermeasure to the physical attackers that can threaten it, and usually Spikes to help pressure its often Spikes-weak switch-ins to patch up its passivity. Forretress is almost always used alongside Blissey, being the tier's most viable user of Rapid Spin, a switch-in to Metagross, Snorlax, and Deoxys-A, a user of Spikes, and a means to beat Latias via Explosion. Lugia is also a common partner, checking Snorlax, Metagross, and nearly every other physical attacker that threatens Blissey out; it can also set up Reflect to cushion Blissey against physical attacks, including weaker Explosions, and it benefits greatly from Blissey's Heal Bell. Salamence can check Deoxys-A and Groudon and bolster Blissey's Heal Bell support with its own Wish support, and it enjoys said Heal Bell. Deoxys-D can threaten Latias and Latios more immediately with Knock Off and set up Spikes for Blissey, and it can in turn take advantage of Heal Bell. Metagross can check Snorlax and Deoxys-A and use Explosion to remove some of the specially offensive sets that can beat Blissey. Latias or Latios can be used to defeat Kyogre variants that Blissey cannot: Substitute + Calm Mind and Rest+Calm Mind. Groudon can help Blissey by setting up sun, significantly lowering Kyogre's damage output and preventing Blissey from being frozen. Ho-Oh benefits from Light Screen softening damage from Latias and Latios, allowing it to more freely hit them with Shadow Ball. Ho-Oh and Deoxys-A can take advantage of Blissey forcing Latias and Latios to use Recover or Refresh to freely switch in and threaten them.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Blissey is the defining special wall of ADV OU. It has no special weaknesses and shrugs off special attacks with impunity, countering a wide range of special threats and minimally acting as a safe pivot into those that run utility moves to get past it. Because it takes so little damage, it can choose not to recover after taking a hit even under sand or after taking Spikes damage, generating free turns that can be used to gain momentum via its punishing moves or double switches. Its moveset can be customized to suit both defensive and offensive needs; it can apply three different kinds of status, support teammates with Wish or Heal Bell, fire off punishing elemental coverage moves, and even pull off a surprise Counter in the face of a physical threat. Due to its enormous HP stat, Blissey can also deal with a number of physical moves from mixed attackers like Salamence, Zapdos, and even mixed Tyranitar or defensive Swampert to some extent.</p> <p>Blissey's main weaknesses are its lack of resilience against powerful physical moves and relative passivity. This makes it easy for Metagross, physical Tyranitar, and Snorlax to exert pressure on Blissey and for Calm Mind users, especially those with a healing move, to overwhelm Blissey with boosted special attacks. Blissey can also be forced out by status and is easy to set Spikes against. Still, many of these weaknesses can be patched by the appropriate filler moves. Blissey on non-Spikes teams usually carries Wish and is ideal for supporting bulky wallbreakers like Choice Band Salamence, Metagross, and Suicune.</p> <p>Blissey is mostly used with Spikes, and it is especially resilient in the face of Spikes and sand compared to other special tanks like Celebi, Snorlax, and Regice. It is by far the most commonly used special wall in the Toxic + Spikes + Sandstorm (TSS) archetype. However, it can also be used without Spikes to shield and support a late-game setup sweeper like Curse Snorlax or Calm Mind Jirachi. Blissey can also be used on non-Spikes offensive teams as a robust special wall and one of the few Gengar checks.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snatch can be used with Toxic alongside mixed sweepers to sustain the chip on Milotic, Suicune, and Celebi, never letting them exploit Blissey's passivity to recover. It also helps Blissey deal with Calm Mind users a little better. For example, as Suicune is worn down by Toxic and is about to use Rest, a surprise Snatch can cause Suicune to get KOed by Toxic and sand damage. Light Screen can be used to support Skarmory or Forretress against Magneton.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Threats</strong>: Tyranitar, Metagross, Snorlax, and offensive Swampert all force Blissey out. Snorlax can exploit Blissey's passivity to set up with Curse, especially out of sand, and Tyranitar with Lum Berry can set up with Dragon Dance on Blissey. These physical threats, however, need to be careful of Blissey's mitigating strategies: Toxic for Tyranitar and Swampert, Fire Blast for Metagross, and Counter for all of them. These physical threats can also have their progress stalled out by Wish. In addition, these Pokemon have to be wary of double switches into Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Heracross and Breloom exert immense pressure should they get a switch-in on Blissey. Heracross's Guts allows it to absorb status from Blissey rather well. Hariyama also comes in easily on Blissey with its high HP and makes progress with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Standard Dugtrio can pick off a weakened Blissey, and bulky Dugtrio, especially on special offense teams, can even threaten to 2HKO Blissey and live to tell the tale.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic forces Blissey lacking Heal Bell out and threatens to cripple the incoming Pokemon. It also frequently weakens Blissey enough to make it susceptible to a Dugtrio trap.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt Skarmory and Gengar prevent Blissey from recovering after coming in. Skarmory can proceed to set Spikes, apply Toxic poison, or attack Blissey, while Gengar's Will-O-Wisp puts immense pressure on Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Blissey's huge HP stat can feed Celebi and, to some extent, Venusaur indefinitely thanks to Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Many teams use Blissey to compensate for huge special weaknesses on the rest of the team. It's very easy to draw Blissey in with a special threat and double switch or phaze to get Spikes damage.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Soft-Boiled is mandatory because Blissey tends to participate in mid- and slow-paced games and will likely get worn out over the course of a game. Blissey can usually wait to take two or three hits before using Soft-Boiled because of its amazing bulk.</p> <p>The second move ensures that Dugtrio does not simply remove Blissey with zero effort. Ice Beam hits Gengar and allows Blissey to check mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence somewhat reliably. Counter is good for teams with a Pursuit trapper to get rid of Gengar or for teams that are just a little soft against physical attacks like Metagross's Meteor Mash, Swampert's Earthquake, mixed Tyranitar's Brick Break, and any of Aerodactyl's attacks. Counter should not be the primary means by which these attacks are dealt with because Blissey is usually vital to preserve for mid-game, but late-game, Blissey can lure in and take out physical or mixed attackers just as the opponent thinks a sweep is assured. Pursuit trapper + Forretress teams benefit from Counter, as well as teams that form soft-checking cores between Pokemon like Flygon, Metagross, and offensive Suicune with Zapdos or Moltres to handle physical attackers like Tyranitar and Metagross, with Superman teams—teams that use hovering Pokemon to avoid Spikes—being a prominent example of them. Ice Beam and Counter are not mutually exclusive. Traditionally, Counter, unlike Ice Beam, ensures that Dugtrio gets OHKOed regardless of its bulk. However, the emergence of Beat Up on Dugtrio, which cannot be Countered, puts forth a strong case for Ice Beam to be used alongside Counter.</p> <p>By doing a fixed amount of damage regardless of the foe's defensive boosts, Seismic Toss is the most consistent attacking move because it allows Blissey to force Suicune to use Rest and beats chipped or statused Calm Mind users that have no ability to recover like offensive Celebi, Jirachi, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it still is not entirely reliable against these offensive Calm Mind users, as Blissey needs to recover quite a bit against them and can get affected by Special Defense drops or paralysis. Seismic Toss also allows Blissey to reliably chip most other Pokemon bar Gengar without concern of the incoming target's elemental resistances. Fire Blast and Thunderbolt relieve the Spikes pressure a bit by hitting Skarmory hard. Thunderbolt also clobbers Cloyster. Fire Blast 2HKOes Metagross and Heracross and OHKOes Breloom, while Thunderbolt puts immense pressure on Milotic, Suicune, Recover Starmie, and Gyarados. It also prevents Suicune from PP stalling with Rest if it is has not yet used Calm Mind, but Blissey should not be used solely to deal with Suicune in any case.</p> <p>Blissey can run a variety of status moves in its filler slot. Thunder Wave paralyzes most switch-ins such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Skarmory and helps slow Pokemon like Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross outrun them. Thunder Wave is also useful for stopping physical attackers in a pinch. It threatens to thwart Dragon Dance Tyranitar's and Agility Metagross's sweeps and gives Blissey an out against Aerodactyl by relying on full paralysis, all of which, while unreliable, is still notable. Thunder Wave also helps Blissey beat offensive Jirachi. Toxic is a much better status move against Tyranitar not only because it is the only way Blissey can consistently do damage to it, but also because paralysis allows Tyranitar to switch freely into Will-O-Wisp from Gengar. Toxic also forces out Swampert and Blissey and can be useful on Pursuit Tyranitar teams that do not have the physical pressure to otherwise punish opposing Blissey. Ice Beam + Fire Blast + Toxic is a good combination of moves that nails all of Blissey's common switch-ins—Metagross, Skarmory, and Tyranitar—at the expense of being beaten by Calm Mind users. Sing can completely shut down a huge threat like Tyranitar, Metagross, or Skarmory, which can help Pokemon like Jirachi and Aerodactyl. However, if it misses, it can also lure in sleep fodder like Magneton, Claydol, and Pursuit Tyranitar, all of which can be trapped by Dugtrio or one's own Pursuit Tyranitar. Sing, while unreliable, may help to take down tanks like Milotic, Rest Zapdos, and even other Blissey, denying them recovery opportunities as they get chipped down by Seismic Toss and perhaps Spikes damage.</p> <p>For supportive options, Wish is good for sustaining the team, especially on more offensive Skarmory + Blissey teams. For example, it heals Choice Band Salamence by using Wish as a Fighting-type or Celebi comes in, and it also supports soft Tyranitar checks like Metagross, Flygon, and Suicune as well as soft Metagross checks like Zapdos and Moltres. Wish also supports Skarmory, especially against mixed attackers that hit it hard but can't quite get rid of it and also supports defensive Suicune, which is a worse physical wall than Swampert in sand. Wish + Counter is a common pairing on teams with a Pursuit trapper that helps to minimize the reliance on dedicated physical walls.</p> <p>Heal Bell supports stall teams that use Wish or Rest on other Pokemon for longevity like Jirachi and Suicune, as well as Snorlax and Vaporeon occasionally, and also allows Claydol to use Explosion over Refresh on teams that have enough support to take down Skarmory. As an auxiliary benefit, Heal Bell also helps Blissey deal with foes that use Toxic like Swampert and Zapdos without having to switch out, possibly take Spikes damage, and perhaps let a teammate take a nasty hit or Toxic again. Note, however, that this can only be done occasionally due to Heal Bell's low PP.</p> <p>The listed EVs allow Blissey to OHKO bulkless Dugtrio with Ice Beam. If special attacks are not used on Blissey, the Special Attack EVs can do into HP or Speed, and the nature can be changed to Bold. A Bold nature can still be used with Ice Beam; this especially helps Blissey against mixed Salamence's and Tyranitar's Brick Break. Unfortunately, bulkless Dugtrio is OHKOed with full certainly only after one layer of Spikes instead.</p> <p>Switch Blissey into special threats or status moves. One of Blissey's biggest advantages early-game is its unrevealed moveset; one can play off the fear of firing off a status move to make a double switch to Skarmory or some other threat. Use Wish as a mid-ground move mid-game when it is unclear whether the opponent will pivot out. The key to winning games with Blissey is to exploit the free turns it gets from soaking special hits, either by forcing chip damage by itself on more defensive teams or by supporting offensive teammates with Wish, aggressive double switching, or exploiting its coverage on offensive teams such that the sequence loops in a way that is unfavorable to the opponent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey teams tend to play a mid- to slow-paced game and want a way to punish its switch-ins continuously. Spikes is really helpful for that, and the usual suspects are Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster. Skarmory is perhaps the most common partner, as it lures in all the special threats, which Blissey can fend itself off against, while Calm Mind users usually don't have enough power to really hurt Skarmory before they get phazed out. Skarmory's high Defense and immunity to Spikes also allow it to switch in against any Snorlax, Metagross, and, sometimes, Fighting-types that pivot in on Blissey. Forretress also acts similarly, giving up the ability to hit Fighting-types and phaze for spinning and the ability to OHKO Magneton on the switch. Blissey can also be used with Cloyster on offensive Spikes teams, where, despite the seeming mismatch of pace, it helps to pivot against Gengar and Zapdos.</p> <p>Spikes frequently comes with support aimed at getting more layers up than the opponent. Gengar spinblocks Claydol and Starmie and is great for mid- and fast-paced TSS teams, while Magneton traps opposing Skarmory and helps to enable physical attackers. Claydol and Starmie can spin away Spikes, and they can be used on TSS teams or slow-paced stall teams in conjunction with Magneton or Dugtrio. Finally, one's own Dugtrio and Magneton can trap opposing Magneton. Generally, spinning and trapping Skarmory are efforts geared towards mitigating Blissey's propensity to be Spikes fodder, while spinblocking and trapping Magneton are attempts at closing out the game by pressuring the opponent with one's own Spikes before one gets overwhelmed by the opponent's Spikes</p> <p>Tyranitar is a great partner because sand really makes Blissey's bulk shine; as a comparison, while Celebi can function as a solid special wall in a vacuum, its lower special bulk becomes notable in the presence of sand and Spikes. Tyranitar suited to the pace of Blissey teams are usually the bulky physical attacking set and Pursuit Tyranitar, but there is nothing strictly restricting the use of any Tyranitar set. Tyranitar + Skarmory + Blissey is the core that is synonymous with the TSS archetype. Tyranitar also helps to make progress against Snorlax and Suicune by retaining chip damage with sand, which otherwise come in almost freely on Blissey to dish out powerful attacks or set up.</p> <p>Using Blissey requires answers to physical threats like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence. Bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic help Blissey deal with them, and their passivity tends to invite Electric-types in, which Blissey can deal with. Suicune isn't too robust given it lacks the Rock-type resistance of Swampert and the immediate recovery of Milotic, so Wish or Aromatherapy support is a great option to go with Suicune. Another answer not to be missed is Dugtrio, which cannot switch into Tyranitar and Metagross but can trap them with some chip damage. Dugtrio also threatens to stop pesky Celebi from harassing Blissey with Leech Seed and Jirachi from setting up on Blissey.</p> <p>Offensive Pokemon with good pivoting abilities are great partners for Wish Blissey. Choice Band Salamence can come in on Fighting-types and Celebi. Metagross, Flygon, and Suicune can pivot in against Tyranitar. Moltres, Zapdos, and different Suicune variants can pivot in against Metagross. Most of these Pokemon are frail physical checks in a vacuum, but they become a lot more reliable when supported by Wish.</p> <p>Finally, bulky setup sweepers like Curse Snorlax and Wish Jirachi also appreciate Blissey's ability to support them with Wish or Aromatherapy, respectively, and they also appreciate Blissey's special walling presence mid-game so that their HP can be preserved for late-game.</p>"
        },
        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind Blissey was once a metagame staple that is rarely used nowadays. Despite its fall in relevance, it still offers some niche advantages over utility Blissey. Calm Mind allows Blissey to take on other Calm Mind users that don't have a phazing move. These include offensive Celebi and different variants of Jirachi and Suicune depending on the coverage moves chosen. Note that scouting for their movesets is necessary first, though, as Blissey can recklessly lose the Calm Mind war upon being phazed. It can also muscle past opposing Blissey without Toxic; although opposing Blissey can heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled, it is likely to get afflicted by status, fall to a critical hit, or run out of Soft-Boiled PP before it can stall Blissey out. Finally, Calm Mind Blissey also puts pressure on Milotic and Celebi teams, which otherwise have an easy time stalling Blissey out with Toxic and Leech Seed.</p> <p>Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are the more common coverage moves. Ice Beam confers Calm Mind Blissey all the advantages of standard Blissey when facing Dugtrio and Salamence and, with Calm Mind, allows Blissey to push its way past Celebi. Thunderbolt notably allows Blissey to 3HKO maximum HP Suicune with good odds and with certainty in sand. This is particularly relevant for beating RestTalk Suicune. Thunderbolt also exerts more pressure on Milotic and Cloyster than Hidden Power Grass and eases the matchup against Moltres and Charizard. Note that while Blissey theoretically wins the Calm Mind war with offensive Jirachi without Wish, Jirachi is favored to land a critical hit; this is especially true in sand. As alternative coverage, Flamethrower allows Blissey to 3HKO maximum HP Jirachi and reliably defeat Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi. It also heavily pressures Metagross and OHKOes Forretress. Hidden Power Grass helps to round out the coverage against Water-types, especially Swampert, but cannot be used to reliably beat Suicune.</p> <p>Calm Mind is rarely used early-game, as all of Blissey's checks are still around and need to be removed. Furthermore, revealing Calm Mind throws away the surprise value of this set. Calm Mind should only be used mid-game to force out Pokemon that try to stall out Blissey like Milotic and draw in specific targets like Metagross and Tyranitar that can be chipped or trapped. Once all of Blissey's checks are removed, it can set up at will and push its way past passive PP stallers and certain Calm Mind users.</p> <p>This set has very specific purposes, and its lack of a status or supporting move makes Calm Mind Blissey more of something to support rather than something that supports. It should therefore only be used with a very good reason.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Blissey has two huge weaknesses. First, it has no options for pressuring Tyranitar and Metagross; they can switch in endlessly and not fear getting hit by a status move or super effective coverage. Second, it is also helpless against Calm Mind users with a utility move that is useful against Blissey, like Roar Suicune, Wish Jirachi, and Leech Seed Celebi. Dugtrio is an excellent partner that covers both the physical weaknesses to Tyranitar and Metagross as well as the special weakness to Wish Jirachi and Celebi. It is also good at removing other Blissey, especially those carrying Toxic. Zapdos is a great Suicune check that can be used with Blissey; its Roar also helps as an emergency check against other Calm Mind users. Snorlax can also be used as a Suicune check, and Self-Destruct lets it lure in and severely dent or remove Tyranitar and Metagross.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Larvitar sets itself apart from Bagon as a Dragon Dance user thanks to its resistance to Normal-type moves. This allows it to set up a Dragon Dance against Aipom that is locked into Double Edge or Delcatty, which can often only hope to paralyze Larvitar with Body Slam. After one Dragon Dance, Larvitar is able to outspeed and OHKO most base 85 Speed attackers with either of its STAB moves. Earthquake OHKOes faster attackers such as Staryu, Mankey, and Aipom if Larvitar is holding Soft Sand while threatening Rock- and Electric-types such as Rhyhorn, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Rock Slide provides Larvitar with an option against Flying-types such as Delibird, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Butterfree while also threatening Dustox. Hidden Power Bug threatens bulky Grass-types such as Bayleef and Exeggcute, which otherwise OHKO Larvitar with their Grass-type STAB moves. Alternatively, Larvitar can use Facade to grant it a more powerful option when inflicted with status due to its ability Guts. Soft Sand notably allows Larvitar to always OHKO Aipom with Earthquake when at +1 instead of relying on a 93% chance to do so without it. Alternatively, Larvitar can hold a Lum Berry in order to prevent it from being paralyzed by Delcatty when it tries to set up, though this can be counterproductive if Larvitar is using Facade.</p> <p>Larvitar does its best work on offense teams that rely on special attackers. These teams appreciate Larvitar's usefulness in threatening common special walls like Dustox and Delcatty. Pokemon like Elekid, Chinchou, Staryu, and Croconaw all appreciate Larvitar for these reasons. These special attackers threaten Koffing, which otherwise walls Larvitar and has a chance to OHKO it with Hidden Power Grass. Chinchou is notable as a teammate, as its access to Thunder Wave can create more opportunities for Larvitar to set up or remove threats by remedying its poor Speed. Secondary sweepers that appreciate the removal of special walls and Aipom, such as Growlithe, Masquerain, and Butterfree, pair well with Larvitar. Butterfree's access to Sleep Powder makes it an incredible partner, as it provides Larvitar with more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Growlithe is worth noting, as it threatens Grass-types like Bayleef, which allows Larvitar to more safely use Facade over Hidden Power Bug. Larvitar fails to outspeed Elekid, Luvdisc, and Voltorb when at +1, so Pokemon that can check them, such as Castform and Dustox, are appreciated.</p>"

    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>A trolly base 51 Speed (getting to outspeed fully invested base 50s before boosting is pretty golden) and a great offensive typing are enough tools to give Pupitar an edge in the NU metagame, but what really makes Pupitar one of the absolute top offensive threats in the tier is its access to Dragon Dance. At just +1, Pupitar packs only slightly less power than Choice Band Relicanth while also outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in the tier. Its access to fantastic offensive STAB moves cannot be understated, and Hidden Power Bug and Hidden Power Flying both give Pupitar the coverage it needs. Even its ability Shed Skin is a gigantic perk that protects it somewhat against sleep, burn, and paralysis, and with a natural immunity to Thunder Wave, Pupitar has an easy time steamrolling over purely defensive teams. The only major downside is that Pupitar is rather slow before boosting, which can leave it vulnerable to more offensive teams. Outside of Dragon Dance, though, Pupitar is heavily outclassed by the other Rock-types in the tier, which are far stronger and bulkier, including Graveler, Sudowoodo, and Relicanth.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are a lot of different ways to play with Pupitar, but almost none of them will be as effective as the set above. Taunt + Dragon Dance and Substitute + Dragon Dance both have their perks and can secure a sweep where just having the coverage of Hidden Power Bug would not, but finding the time to use both moves can be a daunting task when a good portion of the tier has a move that will hit Pupitar super effectively. Adding Liechi Berry to the Substitute + Dragon Dance set is an option that has a huge payoff if done well. A bulky EV spread and the Dragon Dance set above can be done, but Pupitar doesn't have much bulk to speak of, and the only real benefit would be making Pupitar harder to KO with Hitmonchan's Mach Punch.</p> <p>A Choice Band set is certainly doable, and Pupitar has a huge perk in outspeeding max Speed Mawile and other base 50s like Piloswine. However, while there may be a bit of a surprise factor to running Choice Band, Pupitar will still be weaker than the likes of Sudowoodo and Graveler and would much rather keep its main advantage of outspeeding the tier after a boost rather than having immediately strong moves. Finally, Toxic is an option to get cripple defensive Tangela, but that's about the only target it'll make an impact on.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Physically defensive Tangela is probably the ultimate switch-in to Pupitar, as it's not 2HKOed by anything a +1 Pupitar can throw at it and easily OHKOes in return with Hidden Power Grass. Even at +5 Pupitar will fail to OHKO defensive Tangela with Hidden Power Bug. Physically defensive Whiscash, Wailord, and Kingler are probably the next best defensive switch-ins to Pupitar, as they can tank an Earthquake with ease and OHKO Pupitar in return with Surf. Physically defensive Relicanth can tank an Earthquake or two if using Protect and easily 2HKO Pupitar with its own Earthquake.</p> <p>Bulky Hitmonchan, Hitmonchan with Mach Punch, and Machoke can prevent Pupitar from getting too dangerous and pick off weakened ones easily enough. Defensive Bellossom takes a lot from Hidden Power Bug but also easily OHKOes with Hidden Power Grass or Giga Drain. Offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail will be able to tank an attack and OHKO in return, but they will leave the exchange heavily battered. It should be noted that Huntail can even use a +1 Pupitar as setup bait if Huntail is at full health, as it can tank an Earthquake, set up Rain Dance, and then outspeed and OHKO the next turn; Timid Huntail is fast enough to not fear Pupitar getting to +2 either. Finally, Piloswine can tank multiple attacks from Pupitar from behind a Reflect and easily OHKO in return with Earthquake.</p>",

        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Ideally, only bring out Pupitar late-game when the opponent's walls have been sufficiently weakened, set up Dragon Dance immediately, and pummel foes with the appropriate move. Earthquake + Rock Slide is great STAB coverage and all that Pupitar really needs most of the time. At +1, Rock Slide is a guaranteed OHKO vs 252 HP Glalie and offensive Pelipper, whereas Hidden Power Rock just falls short and doesn't come with a flinch chance, making Rock Slide the more desired option for Rock STAB despite the lower accuracy.</p> <p>Hidden Power Bug can be used in the last slot for a reliable 2HKO on all but the most physically defensive Chimecho and Grass-types like Bellossom and Tangela, though standard defensive Tangela can avoid the 2HKO and OHKO Pupitar in return with its STAB moves. Protect is a neat alternative that can bide time for Leftovers recovery, pushing Pupitar out of a 3HKO range from Seismic Toss and Night Shade. Protect also comes with the benefit of scouting the opponent's Choice Band moves and allows for extra turns to activate Shed Skin if needed.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed for Pupitar to outpace the entire unboosted tier after a single Dragon Dance, as well as ensure that Pupitar can outspeed maximum investment base 50s before boosting, primarily Timid Bellossom. An Adamant nature can be used, but this leaves Pupitar at only 302 Speed at +1, leaving it outsped by all maximum investment base 90s and up, including big threats like Venomoth, Haunter, and Plusle. Taunt is a great choice for the last slot as it prevents the opponent from setting up on it or healing and can bide time for extra turns of Leftovers recovery and Shed Skin activation. Hidden Power Flying is the best alternative to Hidden Power Bug as it gets a super effective hit on Hitmonchan and retains the super effective hit on Bellossom and Tangela. Rest can be used in the last slot to let Pupitar quickly recover health and remove status manually, and it has a high chance of wearing off early thanks to Shed Skin. This is difficult to pull off though, especially considering that even extremely defensive teams will have multiple moves that will easily 2HKO Pupitar. Finally, Double-Edge can fill out the set and is a great safety move to use when you're unsure of what the opponent will switch to next, although it does come with some recoil.</p> <p>Spikes are a great tool to generally weaken the checks and counters to Pupitar, as all of them are grounded, particularly the Grass- and Water-types. Flareon and Murkrow are good partners to take out the Grass-types that threaten Pupitar easily, while Plusle and Grass-types of your own can take out the Water-types that stand in Pupitar's path. Hidden Power Grass Plusle for example can eliminate Whiscash and nearly all of the other Water-types in the tier. Physically defensive Chimecho tank Pupitar's STAB moves and threatens an easy 2HKO back with Psychic if Pupitar lacks Hidden Power Bug, making Sableye and Metang good partners too.</p> <p>Pupitar can have a tough time setting up if it can't get in against a Normal-, Bug-, Rock-, or Flying-type locked into an ineffective move, making an Encore partner or a screen partner a good teammate as well to give Pupitar the best chance of setting up as possible. A particularly good screen partner is Reflect Piloswine, as it tends to lure in Hitmonchan and can eliminate its threat of Mach Punch before bringing in Pupitar to clean the rest of the opponent's team.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is the defining Pokemon of ADV OU. First, its ability Sand Stream alone tremendously shapes the strategies and team choices in the metagame. By damaging and nullifying Leftovers on non-Steel-, Ground-, and Rock-types, sand shifts similar roles towards Pokemon that are immune to or more robust under sand. Swampert more reliably checks physical threats than Suicune despite worse stats; Claydol is the preferred spinner over Starmie even with its middling Speed and offensive presence; Blissey's extreme special bulk keeps it around a lot longer under sand than Celebi, and it forms part of the Skarmory + Blissey core so frequently used on defensive teams with Tyranitar. As a result, sand defines one of the most prominent defensive archetypes in the metagame: Toxic + Sandstorm + Spikes (TSS). As an offensive tool, sand makes damage stick, greatly neutering the effectiveness of threatening setup sweepers like Suicune and Snorlax while also forcing frequent recovery from Celebi, Blissey, and Milotic. As a defensive tool, sand limits certain varieties of offense by placing Choice Band and Berry-focused Pokemon on a timer. Sand also provides a lot of information in battle, revealing the items on Pokemon like Salamence and Heracross and distinguishing Choice Band and Salac Berry sets from those running Leftovers. As a simulator mechanic, sand reveals the relative Speeds of the Pokemon on the field, dealing damage to the faster Pokemon first.</p> <p>Sand isn’t enough for you? Tyranitar itself is a behemoth in battle; with a strong stat distribution and large movepool, it can fulfill a variety of roles on almost every team. The Dragon Dance set can act as a wallbreaker or sweeper; Pursuit threatens to punish not just Gengar but also other hovering threats such as Choice Band Salamence, Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Claydol; the mixed set dismantles TSS-style teams; the bulky physical attacker set exploits Spikes really well by forcing switches; the Choice Band set provides a lot of immediate firepower if supported well or accompanied by good predictions; and the SubPunch set gives added protection against status from Blissey and Snorlax and can be a great lure. While these sets are mostly offensive in nature, Tyranitar's typing and decent defensive stats also allow it to pivot in on Normal-, Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic-type moves, guarding the team against Snorlax, Moltres, Aerodactyl, Salamence, Celebi, and Jirachi.</p> <p>While Tyranitar has an incredible number of strengths, it is not without weaknesses. It fails to outspeed just about every offensive Pokemon and even some defensive ones like Celebi without considerable Speed investment. Even with a Speed boost from Dragon Dance, it can be outsped by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Jolteon, and possibly Starmie. While its typing is mostly positive for it, the Water- and Ground-type weaknesses prevent it from staying in on bulky Water-types and allow it to be easily trapped by Dugtrio. In particular, teams that derive their value from Tyranitar through sand immunity usually leave themselves prone to offensive Water-types, as they usually rely on a single special wall as their Water-type check. Other weaknesses such as Fighting, Grass, and Steel allow many Pokemon to take out Tyranitar in up to two hits after some chip damage, and these attacks frequently come from Pokemon that Tyranitar is supposed to check or be able to do heavy damage to in the first place, like Salamence, Metagross, Gengar, offensive Jirachi, and Celebi. Keeping Tyranitar healthy enough to serve its purpose is key to using it successfully.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute Tyranitar can be an excellent wallbreaker. With 101 HP Substitutes, Tyranitar blocks status moves from Blissey and eliminates the prediction required to fire off Focus Punch. Follow up moves such as Hidden Power Grass, Fire Blast, and Thunder can then severely damage incoming checks like Swampert, Metagross, and Suicune. While mixed Substitute + Focus Punch sets are great lures, they require compromises in Special Attack EVs due to the need for maximum HP and sufficient Speed to outrun tanks while using a Speed-reducing nature. Thus, physical EVs with Rock Slide + Hidden Power Bug or Grass can also be used. Substitute Tyranitar fits well on paralysis-spam teams, allowing Tyranitar to fish for full paralysis.</p> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar can run Salac Berry with Fire-, Grass-, and Fighting-type coverage and offensive EVs just like the mixed Tyranitar set, giving it an extra opportunity to outspeed and trap Gengar while retaining its offensive abilities by using its relatively high Speed unlike bulky Pursuit Tyranitar. Getting into Salac Berry range is not as difficult as it sounds, as teammates can be sacrificed and Spikes damage can be used to manipulate Tyranitar's HP. Thunder Wave can be used, especially on Pursuit Tyranitar, as a nasty surprise against checks like Metagross and Suicune; Ice Beam + Hidden Power Grass coverage allows Tyranitar to deter Ground-types, which do not get affected by Thunder Wave.</p> <p>A variety of items can be used with Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Salac Berry can also be used on bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar to outspeed the entire metagame after a single boost; Endure goes well with that set. Liechi Berry can help with wallbreaking when a Water-type attack brings Tyranitar into activation range. Soft Sand can be used on Dragon Dance Tyranitar to nab the OHKOs on Metagross and Tyranitar after a single layer of Spikes.</p> <p>Protect is especially useful on lead Tyranitar; it scouts the item on lead Salamence and also scouts Choice Band Salamence's move. It also helps Tyranitar heal out of Dugtrio's Earthquake range, giving Tyranitar the chance to KO it. Protect is most easily placed on Pursuit Tyranitar, but it can also be used with bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Notably, Protect allows Tyranitar to survive two Surfs from uninvested Suicune and potentially two Surfs from Milotic too. These odds, compounded with those of Rock Slide flinching, make it very likely that Tyranitar breaks through Milotic.</p> <p>Curse + Rest can be used to turn the tables on Flygon and Claydol, but the prevalence of Water-type moves and the high chance of a critical hit while setting up makes the sweep difficult to pull off. Rest, perhaps even with Chesto Berry, can be used on bulky Tyranitar sets too, giving Tyranitar another lease on life after being burned in the process of trapping Gengar. Toxic can be used to slowly wear down Swampert and Suicune, but the prevalence of Refresh Swampert makes such an option unreliable. For this reason, it is a good idea to use Taunt alongside Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Tyranitar is extremely versatile, its checks and counters can be rather set specific.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types all have the ability to at least 2HKO Tyranitar. Swampert is the premier physical Tyranitar check, boasting the important Rock-type resistance and sand immunity. Unfortunately, Swampert is also the target of a wallbreaker set with Hidden Power Grass. Milotic and, to some extent, Suicune do much better at facing mixed Tyranitar, with the former shrugging its hits off and latter easily pivoting in on any move other than Hidden Power Grass to force Tyranitar out. Suicune, however, gets easily worn down due to its lack of instant recovery. Although Starmie is frail, it can come in on unboosted attacks or even pivot into mixed Tyranitar, outspeed boosted Tyranitar that lack a Speed-boosting nature, and attempt to KO back with Hydro Pump. Gyarados also deals with mixed Tyranitar lacking Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon resists Rock-type moves and is immune to Earthquake, making it a good check to physical Tyranitar sets. It needs to be wary of Ice Beam and Double-Edge, however, and offensive sets without much bulk can be flinched down by Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Claydol completely nullifies Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar and can hold its ground against other Tyranitar sets as long as it pivots into Rock Slide. Claydol, however, takes a great deal of damage from Hidden Power Bug and Crunch. Although rare, Donphan is also an excellent counter to physical Tyranitar that isn't too weak to Hidden Power Grass, and Steelix can survive two boosted Earthquakes from Jolly Dragon Dance Tyranitar with the help of Protect to 2HKO back.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio sets itself apart from other Ground-types with its ability to trap Tyranitar. Jolly Dugtrio can outspeed +1 Tyranitar and has a 75% chance to OHKO bulkless Tyranitar. It's also not too difficult to chip the bulky sets into OHKO range. Adamant Dugtrio cannot outspeed boosted Jolly Tyranitar, but it OHKOes bulkless Tyranitar with certainty and OHKOes full HP Tyranitar half the time.</p> <p><strong>Metagross</strong>: With a bit of bulk, Metagross can often come in on Rock Slide or Dragon Dance, survive the Earthquake, and OHKO back bulkless Tyranitar with Meteor Mash. Defensive Metagross can even survive two unboosted Earthquakes and still OHKO bulkless Tyranitar in return. Metagross can also survive Fire Blast and attempt to KO back. Regardless, Metagross is still a check, not a hard counter; care has to be taken not to switch Metagross into a super effective move unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Despite not being too robust under sand, Fighting-types resist Rock Slide and can OHKO Tyranitar and thus can serve as an offensive check to physical Tyranitar; Hariyama and Machamp are particular examples, with no special weaknesses to Tyranitar's coverage moves either. Breloom resists both Rock Slide and Earthquake and can potentially pack Mach Punch to turn the tables on Dragon Dance Tyranitar; however, Breloom has to be wary of Fire Blast and Ice Beam. Heracross does not resist Rock but can easily OHKO Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Salamence and Gyarados can be important pivots against Dragon Dance Tyranitar by using Intimidate to eliminate its boosts and pivoting or sacrificing themselves or another teammate to send in a check.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: This only applies to the mixed set. Fire-types like Moltres and Charizard have a niche in being able to resist three of mixed Tyranitar's moves and are able to hit back decently hard with Hidden Power Grass.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Fast Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fast Dragon Dance Tyranitar is unique in the metagame in that it can simultaneously function as a sweeper and wallbreaker. Dragon Dance raises Tyranitar's already impressive Attack to insane levels and boosts its middling Speed beyond everything in the entire metagame bar Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Jolteon.</p> <p>As a sweeper, Tyranitar's Rock Slide + Earthquake hits the whole metagame bar Claydol, Flygon, and Breloom for at least neutral damage. That is where the remaining move fills the gap. +1 Hidden Power Bug 2HKOes Claydol and has the added perk of OHKOing offensive Starmie and Celebi, which can OHKO back with Hydro Pump or attempt to use Leech Seed to heal up Tyranitar's checks, respectively. This overall coverage makes Tyranitar absolutely terrifying late-game.</p> <p>As a wallbreaker, Tyranitar's boosted Rock Slide minimally leaves checks like Milotic and Suicune at about 10-30% of their HP as it goes down, and it can even break through them with Rock Slide's high flinch rate. Hidden Power Grass severely dents Swampert, its main target, with a 92% chance to 2HKO the standard set of 248 HP / 44 SpD without Protect. Earthquake can KO Metagross with a bit of prior damage. This set is such a potent threat because its terrifying physical presence frequently locks the opponent into sending Swampert in even if they expect Hidden Power Grass coming.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a less common filler move primarily used to OHKO Flygon; it also has the auxiliary benefits of OHKOing Salamence through Intimidate and still hitting Claydol for respectable damage. Ice Beam notably hits Breloom hard, stopping it from comfortably checking Tyranitar. Double-Edge is an alternative that hits both Claydol and Flygon, and in some scenarios it gives the extra power needed to finish off the bulky Water-types; Spikes laid by a teammate can complement Double-Edge by bringing Tyranitar's checks into KO range. Regardless of its role, Lum Berry is the most useful item, allowing Tyranitar to set up on status moves like Zapdos's and Magneton's Thunder Wave, Gengar's Will-O-Wisp, Skarmory's Toxic, and Blissey's status move, all of which would hinder or entirely nullify Tyranitar in both of its roles.</p> <p>A spread of 244 Atk / 12 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature is recommended should Tyranitar use Hidden Power Grass to 2HKO Swampert if it does not use Protect and still has a high enough probability of doing so after a Protect to force a switch. With Ice Beam, no Special Attack EVs are needed. Hasty, Naughty, or Lonely can be used over Naive. By sacrificing physical instead of special defense, Tyranitar gains much better odds to survive two hits from offensive Zapdos and has better survivability under Spikes against non-Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump from Swampert and special attacks from Jirachi, but it gets OHKOed with certainty by Dugtrio and very likely also in the Dragon Dance Tyranitar mirror matchup. Using an Attack-boosting instead of Speed-boosting nature allows Tyranitar to wallbreak more effectively and sweep with less chip damage at the expense of not outspeeding Starmie, Adamant Dugtrio, and fast Gengar. Notably, the added Attack allows Tyranitar to OHKO uninvested Dragon Dance Salamence with certainty.</p> <p>Be sure to send Tyranitar out against foes that cannot threaten it from full health very much like Blissey, Magneton, Jirachi, Zapdos, Gengar, Choice-locked Salamence and Aerodactyl, and other weak attackers that cannot easily 2HKO it. These are the opportunities that Tyranitar needs to get that one—and sometimes even two—Dragon Dance up and wreak havoc. If you're intending to sweep with Tyranitar, make sure that the appropriate checks like Swampert and Milotic have been weakened to the point that they cannot contest its sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Building well with this set requires exploiting its strengths as a wallbreaker and sweeper. It is most frequently seen on fast-paced offenses with fluid gameplans that can materialize opportunities for either of its roles. These teams frequently feature other Pokemon that break walls or follow up Tyranitar's wallbreaking to sweep. One such wallbreaker is Metagross. Choice Band Metagross can take out Skarmory and bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic with an early Explosion; mixed Metagross can slowly wear Skarmory and Swampert down and still use Explosion on the other bulky Water-types; even Agility or Protect Metagross can do a lot of chip damage with help from Spikes. Offensive Swampert itself, including the Endeavor variant, is another wallbreaker that pressures opposing Swampert. While switching Swampert into opposing Swampert may seem disadvantageous, teams using Swampert frequently have no solid Swampert checks, encouraging the opposing Swampert to stay in to be chipped. With some planning and luck, activating Torrent could even let Swampert win the mirror matchup. Offensive Snorlax pivots into Water-types that scare Tyranitar out and gets important chip damage with Focus Punch on Metagross and Skarmory; this allows Metagross to be OHKOed by boosted Tyranitar and makes Skarmory a lot less reliable in checking it. Alternatively, offensive Snorlax can trade KOs with Metagross and Skarmory using Curse + Self-Destruct. Cloyster pivots into Water-types, sets Spikes, and chips its target with Explosion, which can turn 2HKOs on Metagross and opposing Tyranitar into OHKOs. Spikes does more than weaken the team for a sweep; it also makes it a lot harder for the opponent to stop the sweep by pivoting to Salamence for an Intimidate drop and then to Metagross to resist the Rock Slide. Finally, examples of follow-up sweepers should Tyranitar be used as a wallbreaker include physical threats like Dragon Dance Salamence, Agility Metagross, and Aerodactyl. Dragon Dance Salamence and Aerodactyl are also able to set up to sweep or revenge kill Dugtrio should it take out Tyranitar.</p>"
        },
        "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar distinguishes itself from the fast variant in that it intends to use Dragon Dance twice with its bulk to sweep. With its defensive EVs, it survives Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake, unboosted Metagross's Meteor Mash, and Starmie's and Suicune's Hydro Pump, and it comfortably takes two hits from Zapdos and offensive Hidden Power Grass Gengar. The bulk also allows Tyranitar to tank +1 Dragon Dance Salamence's Earthquake and possibly OHKO it back as a last-ditch check. Rock Slide + Earthquake hits the whole metagame bar Claydol, Flygon, and Breloom for neutral damage. Hidden Power Bug rounds out the coverage, allowing Tyranitar to plow through Claydol and bulkless Flygon with some chip damage while also giving it an easier time against Celebi, which can otherwise take out Tyranitar with its Grass-type moves and some luck. It also usually OHKOes offensive Starmie after a boost. Taunt prevents phazing from Skarmory and even Suicune or Swampert if one is willing to make a read, and it stops status moves like Toxic from Skarmory and Thunder Wave from Blissey from ruining a sweep. When used as a lead for setting up sand, Taunt also prevents Skarmory from freely laying down Spikes. It is possible to use Substitute in the filler slot with 252 HP EVs, which produce 101 HP Substitutes that block Blissey's Seismic Toss; this can be useful in fishing for paralysis in paralysis-spam archetypes while still doing the job of blocking status and setting up on slow Pokemon like Blissey, Porygon2, and Body Slam Snorlax.</p> <p>Since this set is EVed to survive, not to trade, it is not a wallbreaker but a sweeper. The general plan for sweeping with this Tyranitar should be to leave it mostly untouched while waiting for all of the opponent's Tyranitar checks to be worn down before setting up. Note that the vastly reduced Attack gives only middling odds for Tyranitar to take out Zapdos or Salamence without any boosts, and this is a likely scenario with Salamence's Intimidate in the picture. The same can also be said of Tyranitar's attempt to take out maximum HP defensively uninvested Claydol at +2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On the defensive side, taking even a tiny bit of damage nullifies this Tyranitar's benchmarks, so support to keep it at full HP is definitely helpful. Spinners such as Starmie and Claydol help to keep Spikes off the field. Wish support from Jirachi and Blissey, especially after a sacrifice, also allows Tyranitar to heal up right before sweeping. On the offensive side, this Tyranitar wants support to wear down its checks. Choice Band Metagross is particularly apt, as it lures in and removes Skarmory with Explosion without it laying a single layer of Spikes, allowing Tyranitar to fulfill all its defensive benchmarks when it enters the field. However, this set features relatively more on balanced teams that use Spikes from Skarmory and sometimes Cloyster to wear down the opponent's Pokemon uniformly so that Tyranitar's all-encompassing coverage can break through late-game. Spikes also makes it a lot harder for the opponent to stop the sweep by pivoting to Salamence for an Intimidate drop and then to Metagross to resist the Rock Slide. Additionally, bulky Dragon Dance Tyranitar has the advantage over the fast set here due to its ability to continue using Dragon Dance in the face of non-Choice Band variants of Salamence and Metagross.</p>"
        },
        "Bulky Physical Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Bulky physical Tyranitar commonly features on TSS-style teams; it sports immense bulk, an intimidating Attack stat, and a brutally varied selection of coverage. Its sheer power and coverage make this set a very realistic threat to any team. Capable of quickly wearing down Skarmory and Swampert with Focus Punch, even hard checks and counters need to keep an eye out while switching into this Tyranitar.</p> <p>With the first three attacks, Tyranitar can hit the entire tier for at least neutral if not super effective damage. Rock Slide is a great spammable STAB move that becomes very difficult to pivot around consistently when Spikes are up. Earthquake hits Metagross, Jirachi, and opposing Tyranitar hard and OHKOes Dugtrio should it try to trap Tyranitar and spoil the fun. Focus Punch hits Skarmory and Swampert for neutral damage, and Hidden Power Bug allows Tyranitar to reliably beat Celebi as well as hit incoming Claydol for meaningful damage. This all-round coverage makes Tyranitar an excellent at forcing switches out of the Pokemon standing right in front, making Focus Punch an excellent move for hitting Tyranitar's checks hard. Roar can be used on slower-paced teams where the Spikes damage can be expected to really rack up, and it provides a defensive lifeline against Rest Suicune lacking Sleep Talk and Curse Snorlax as well as the added bonus of disrupting Baton Pass teams at the cost of the huge damage that can be dished out from a well-timed Focus Punch. Roar can potentially double Spikes chip by forcing special walls in and then forcing them to pivot out to physical walls again, paving the way for a clean KO from threats like Dugtrio.</p> <p>The bulk EVs help Tyranitar survive boosted Dragon Dance Salamence's and Tyranitar's Earthquake, Metagross's Meteor Mash, Starmie's Hydro Pump, and Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake. Maximum Attack EVs are used to get the hefty damage from Tyranitar's coverage moves. The EVs also help against offensive Jirachi's Hidden Power Grass. Leftovers rounds up Tyranitar's defensive role, recovering a significant amount of HP each time it switches in on a passive Pokemon or a resisted attack.</p> <p>Bulky physical Tyranitar is great in the lead spot on TSS-style teams, as it gets up sand immediately, which is key to chipping down non-sand-immune Pokemon such as Suicune, which is immensely threatening to the TSS teams this set commonly finds itself on. You should not be attempting to sweep with this Tyranitar set; rather, focus on chipping down specific checks on your opponent's team to make an opening for a cleaner such as offensive Starmie or Choice Band Aerodactyl. Aim to support Tyranitar early-game with as many layers of Spikes that is safely possible, since it removes the need for Tyranitar to make any huge predicts in order to make significant progress against the opponent's checks. Attempt to get in Tyranitar repeatedly throughout the game against Pokemon such as Blissey, Choice-locked Salamence, Snorlax, and defensive Zapdos that it forces out in order to fully take advantage of the support it gets from Spikes. However, remember to watch out for Focus Punch from Snorlax and status moves such as Toxic from Zapdos and Blissey and take care to get Tyranitar in without sustaining too many smaller hits, as even with such good bulk, uninvested Thunderbolt and Seismic Toss damage can quickly rack up, especially when Spikes are on the field.</p> <p>Tyranitar should also not be overlooked as a defensive pivot that can force out unboosted Snorlax and decently checks defensive Celebi and Calm Mind Jirachi thanks to its bulk, typing, and sheer power. It should also be noted that sometimes, having Tyranitar at a good amount of HP can provide extra wiggle room against late-game threats such as Starmie, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. However, this line of play has to be performed pretty deliberately, as keeping Tyranitar at full throughout a game is not particularly easy due to how it is easily chipped by Spikes and weak attacks throughout a game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Naturally, this set fits best in Spikes-orientated teams due to its ability to force lots of switches and easily rack up chip damage. Because of this, you really can't go wrong pairing this set with most Spikers; both Skarmory and Cloyster fully appreciate its presence on a team and how Tyranitar likes to lure in defensive Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune and Steel-types, which are easy to set Spikes against. Additionally, Cloyster is armed with Explosion, which, if timed right, has the power to put some Tyranitar checks out of commission.</p> <p>Defensively speaking, special pivots such as Blissey, Celebi, and, to a lesser extent, Jolteon are all also appreciated by Tyranitar; the former two can absorb status with Natural Cure and even potentially heal up Tyranitar with Wish or Leech Seed, respectively. Jolteon appreciates Tyranitar for providing immense pressure against Blissey, and it makes a great momentum gaining target for Jolteon's Baton Passes while providing an absorber to strong Thunderbolts Tyranitar doesn't want to take. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert also make good partners; their ability to sponge Metagross's attacks is much appreciated, as it gives Tyranitar the space to play a longer game and fully take advantage of Spikes. Gengar also deserves a separate special mention, as between it and Tyranitar, all of Snorlax's coverage is walled flawlessly.</p> <p>Finally, offensive partners vary from Gengar, which also takes advantage of Spikes and has strong special attacks, to teammates built for late-game cleaning such as Aerodactyl, which hugely appreciates Tyranitar's ability to soften up Rock-resistant foes and make room for it to finish the job. Other potential offensive partners include the likes of Starmie and Moltres, providing support through cleaning and breaking, respectively.</p>"
        },
        "Pursuit": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar's main purpose is to trap Gengar, which can otherwise wreak havoc on teams that rely on Rapid Spin, lack burn pivots, or use physically offensive Pokemon with moves that Gengar soaks with its plethora of immunities and resistances. Pursuit also has the auxiliary benefit of forcing chip damage on Choice-locked Salamence and Aerodactyl. With some prediction or the benefit of its set being unrevealed, Pursuit Tyranitar can also chip Zapdos and Moltres or even remove Celebi and Claydol. With chip damage from Celebi's Leech Seed or even the occasional Breloom's Mach Punch, Pursuit can furthermore be used to revenge kill Dugtrio. Crunch is a safe move that allows Tyranitar to severely damage any Gengar that attempts to stay in on Pursuit, hits most of unrevealed Tyranitar's switch-ins—Swampert, Metagross, Suicune, Claydol, and Flygon—for at least neutral damage, and can threaten to take out even Snorlax and Swampert with Special Defense drops. Notably, Tyranitar can survive Hydro Pump from offensive Starmie and OHKO back with Crunch in a pinch; this is a scenario that appears rather frequently on teams running Pursuit Tyranitar with Magneton, and these teams are weak to Starmie more often than not.</p> <p>The third move is decided usually by the presence or absence of Magneton on the team. Fire Blast allows Tyranitar to 2HKO Skarmory, preventing it from running amok with Spikes; it also KOes Metagross after Crunch, and Tyranitar has enough bulk to survive non-Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash and perform the trade if necessary. Fire Blast also prevents Heracross and Breloom from coming in freely, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. With Magneton as a teammate, Skarmory and, to a lesser extent, Metagross can be trapped, so there is less of a need for Fire Blast. Ice Beam has several nifty uses here. First, if one can infer that the opponent is not using Gengar, Dugtrio can be baited to trap Tyranitar and be OHKOed in turn by Ice Beam. This frees up Magneton for trapping Skarmory without being concerned about a double switch to Dugtrio. Second, Tyranitar can survive Dragon Dance Salamence's boosted Earthquake and KO back. The decision to preserve Pursuit Tyranitar at full HP can be made when it is inferred that Salamence is the last Pokemon, because it is very likely that an opponent using Salamence will not be simultaneously using Gengar. Ice Beam also 2HKOes Zapdos and Aerodactyl, and it OHKOes Flygon.</p> <p>The last move is chosen to suit the pace of the team. Roar is usually the choice for slower-paced teams that use Spikes, such as those carrying Forretress. As physical Tyranitar is usually the Jirachi check for many teams, Pursuit Tyranitar-based teams can be slightly Jirachi weak. While Roar is not a direct answer to Jirachi, it helps to mitigate that weakness by racking up enough Spikes damage so that Jirachi cannot set up sufficiently later on to be threatening. Roar is also good for denying Suicune, Curse Snorlax, and Dragon Dance users like Salamence, Gyarados, and other Tyranitar setup opportunities should they try to take advantage of weakened Tyranitar or its lack of coverage. Hidden Power Grass is good for nailing Swampert and useful for physically offensive teams that appreciate taking a chunk out of Swampert or sand teams that don't have any Swampert checks. Brick Break prevents opposing Dragon Dance Tyranitar from setting up to +2 and hits Snorlax and Blissey hard. Speed EVs might be useful to outrun Blissey in case Brick Break is used, but its usefulness is limited because Blissey is not 2HKOed, and one should generally not count on Blissey being slow. Other options not mentioned are Earthquake, which gives Tyranitar some semblance of an ability to check Jirachi, Taunt, which halts Skarmory in its tracks and prevents Blissey from taking the opportunity to come in to heal, and Counter, which is a catch-all for Dugtrio, Metagross, and Salamence and lets Tyranitar lure in and remove Claydol, giving Spikers free rein. Note that mixed sets can run a Quiet nature, though that is not strictly necessary if Brick Break's sole purpose is stopping Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p> <p>Although Leftovers is the standard item and gives Tyranitar the longevity for drawn-out games involving Snorlax or Jirachi, Black Glasses can be used when removing, and not just heavily chipping, Gengar is absolutely essential. The scenario where this is most relevant is where Pursuit Tyranitar is used in conjunction with a Pokemon that has no coverage moves for Gengar, such as Curse Snorlax lacking Shadow Ball or Breloom. It provides about 2/3 odds of OHKOing Gengar with Pursuit at the expense of Tyranitar's longevity and nullifying many of its defensive benchmarks.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment gives Tyranitar the bulk to switch in and KO defensive Gengar without a Grass-type move down should Gengar decide to stay in while Tyranitar keeps using Pursuit. It also allows Tyranitar to survive Starmie's Hydro Pump, Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake, boosted Earthquake from Dragon Dance Salamence and Tyranitar, and Metagross's Meteor Mash with high odds after Spikes and Leftovers recovery. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Tyranitar to OHKO offensive Gengar with Crunch or Pursuit on the switch. More Speed at the expense of Special Attack and HP can be used to outrun Blissey and Skarmory at the expense of the aforementioned benchmarks.</p> <p>Even with all its strengths, Tyranitar is not an absolutely reliable trapper. Defensive Gengar is frequently EVed to survive Pursuit on the switch out, and Tyranitar can then be chipped down via burn or removed with Dugtrio. Gengar can also nullify Tyranitar with Hypnosis or play mind games with Tyranitar if it carries Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass. Even Gengar without these moves can play mind games with chipped Tyranitar. Thus, wherever possible, getting Tyranitar in the same turn as Gengar can greatly improve the odds of eliminating it. When Gengar is absent on the opponent's team, it may seem like Pursuit Tyranitar is useless for the battle apart from setting up sand, and one can be discouraged from sending it in. However, prudent use of Tyranitar can still maximize its utility in the battle by setting sand, trading, and exploiting its bulk. For example, if it is inferred that Pursuit Tyranitar is not needed for defensive purposes end-game, it can be switched into something like Snorlax mid-game, even if a stronger check like Metagross might be the more reliable switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit Tyranitar prevents Gengar from performing its defensive and offensive roles: spinblocking, spreading burns, threatening frail offenses that are not fast enough to contest it, and having a plethora of important immunities and resistances. As such, teammates that can exploit its removal are optimal.</p> <p>Defensively, Gengar's removal allows Forretress to use Rapid Spin without fear of getting spinblocked. Defensive Jirachi can fully exploit the Wish + Protect sequence without fear of burn damage accumulating over two turns. Defensive Flygon can be used as a Tyranitar check that is immune to Spikes. Celebi can drop Psychic in favor of a supporting move like Heal Bell or Baton Pass as long as the team has another way of checking Zapdos. With Magneton support, defensive Swampert can give up Hydro Pump and increase its durability tremendously by using both Protect and Refresh; Donphan can be used as a spinner that is a solid physical Tyranitar check; Steelix can be used both as a physical and Electric-type check.</p> <p>Offensively, Pursuit Tyranitar supports all variants of Salamence well, as Gengar is one of the few Pokemon that can survive +1 Salamence and OHKO back. Venusaur is also well supported by Pursuit Tyranitar, for Gengar is one of the few members of stall teams that freely switches in on it. Venusaur's Sleep Powder also gives Tyranitar free turns to come in and trap the sleeping Pokemon; this is especially useful if the opponent uses Claydol as sleep fodder. The combination of Pursuit Tyranitar and Magneton takes a multi-pronged approach in weakening or eliminating most hovering threats—Gengar, Skarmory, Choice Band Salamence and Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Zapdos—reducing the need for prediction when using Choice Band Flygon, Heracross, or one's own Aerodactyl and making up for Gyarados's limited movepool. This combination also allows Curse Snorlax to drop Shadow Ball in favor of the vastly more threatening Earthquake and allows Breloom to run a set with only Fighting-type moves. Notably, Breloom and Pursuit Tyranitar form a very synergistic core. Should Breloom get trapped by Dugtrio, Mach Punch puts it in range of Tyranitar's Pursuit. Tyranitar also pivots into and chips Choice Band Salamence and Moltres, both of which are checks to Breloom.</p>"
        },
        "Mixed": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mixed Tyranitar is a threatening wallbreaker that excels at dismantling slower teams with the versatile coverage granted by its expansive movepool. It weaponizes the element of surprise, drawing in the likes of Swampert and Metagross, which opponents will often switch in expecting physical sets with Rock Slide. With an early prediction, Tyranitar can heavily weaken these Pokemon as they switch in and compromise a defensive structure for an entire game. Its 243 Speed suits its role well; it is faster than the vast majority of Metagross sets, all Swampert sets, uninvested base 100s such as Celebi, Zapdos, and Jirachi, and base 70s with a neutral nature such as Magneton and Skarmory. Getting the first hit off is very valuable for Tyranitar, as this set is not at all resilient. It cannot switch into Zapdos's Thunderbolt, is OHKOed by Hydro Pumps from Torrent-active Swampert and Starmie, and most importantly is easily trapped and picked off by Dugtrio. Tyranitar will get KOed quickly and is not at all suited to drawn-out games, so sharp lines of play are required to harness its potential.</p> <p>Fire Blast scorches Skarmory and Metagross; it is a comfortable 2HKO on both. Skarmory is able to regain health later on with Protect and its excellent pivoting ability, but if Metagross takes a Fire Blast, it is essentially out of the game, and even if it manages to get in safely again later, it is forced to prematurely use Explosion. Hidden Power Grass targets the ubiquitous Swampert, a Pokemon that will switch into Tyranitar very often, as it is the ideal response to physical sets. When using this Tyranitar, bluffing a physical set such as Dragon Dance to lure in Swampert can be devastating and is not too difficult to pull off either. For example, bringing Tyranitar in at a natural Dragon Dance juncture such as versus weakened Blissey achieves this effect.</p> <p>Ice Beam is employed to cover the two 4x Ice-weak Pokemon in the tier, Salamence and Flygon. Salamence cannot use Dragon Dance against this Tyranitar, as it will be comfortably OHKOed. Having the OHKO move for Flygon available is ideal; Flygon is another desired response to Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and as such, mixed Tyranitar excels at luring it. Ice Beam is also the only move other than Focus Punch that mixed Tyranitar can use to OHKO Dugtrio; once Tyranitar has revealed a lack of Leftovers and Fire Blast, Dugtrio could otherwise freely switch into any move and trap it. Rock Slide is an alternative to Ice Beam that lets Tyranitar crush Moltres, and it is stronger against Zapdos. 16 Attack EVs are recommended with Rock Slide, as this allows Tyranitar to always OHKO Aerodactyl. Crunch is a third option, dealing strong neutral hits as a somewhat spammable move and being Tyranitar's only method of 2HKOing Claydol and its best move for dueling Celebi due to Fire Blast's extremely limited PP and imperfect accuracy. Crunch is also notable for OHKOing frailer Gengar sets. However, this Tyranitar is not particularly suited to switching into Gengar due to its poor bulk, and if Tyranitar shows no Leftovers, Gengar will rarely stay in to get hit by Crunch because Pursuit becomes considerably less likely. Crunch is also much worse than Ice Beam and Rock Slide against Zapdos and Salamence.</p> <p>Brick Break completes the set's rainbow of coverage. It is particularly useful in the Tyranitar mirror, with its universal 2HKO giving it the edge against all sets outside of Choice Band and Dragon Dance. It nonetheless stifles Dragon Dance Tyranitar, disallowing the setup of multiple boosts. Brick Break also prevents Blissey from switching into Tyranitar, particularly with Spikes up. However, Tyranitar sadly cannot 2HKO a fully healthy blob. Tyranitar can still potentially break through Blissey with chained Brick Breaks, as the repeated uses of Soft-Boiled that Brick Break forces give Tyranitar more chances for a critical hit and Lum Berry shields Tyranitar from that crucial Thunder Wave. Brick Break is also the best thing this Tyranitar can throw at Snorlax. Focus Punch is an alternative to Brick Break, best used alongside Rock Slide for a one-two punch of forcing Blissey to heal away Rock Slide damage then smashing it as it does so with Focus Punch. Focus Punch also denies Dragon Dance Tyranitar any setup opportunity whatsoever.</p> <p>Lum Berry is a fantastic item for this set; so many defensive teams lean on status to combat Tyranitar. A single-turn shield from Skarmory's Toxic, Gengar's Will-O-Wisp, Snorlax's Body Slam, and Blissey's Thunder Wave and Toxic grants Tyranitar a crucial lifeline that allows it to continue pressurizing for that extra turn or two, which can greatly swing the game's momentum. Leftovers can grant Tyranitar a few turns of passive recovery, especially as defensive teams often spend multiple turns pivoting or using Protect versus mixed Tyranitar. Hasty Tyranitar with Leftovers also consistently avoids being 2HKOed by Timid Zapdos's Thunderbolt. Naturally, one should not rely on this Tyranitar as a Zapdos stop at all, but this bonus is useful in a pinch. Salac Berry is also a viable alternative because Tyranitar is frequently chipped or can be manipulated into activation range by a combination of attacks and Spikes. It allows Tyranitar to fire off that extra super effective hit before it goes down.</p> <p>Hasty is the slightly preferred nature, as it gives Tyranitar a little more staying power against Gengar and Zapdos and enables it to always survives Torrent-boosted Surf from uninvested Swampert—even most of the time after one layer of Spikes. A Naive nature allows Tyranitar to survive two Aerodactyl Rock Slides almost all the time and improves Tyranitar's odds of surviving a MixMence's Brick Break after Spikes. Naive improves Tyranitar's staying power against Claydol's and Flygon's Earthquakes, avoiding the 2HKO from the former more often and the OHKO from all spreads of the latter. A Special Attack-boosting nature can replace the usual Speed-boosting one, and it makes Tyranitar's damage against Skarmory, Swampert, and Metagross stick a little more. However, being slower than the multitude of Pokemon between 221 and 243 Speed—Choice Band Metagross, Endeavor Swampert, uninvested base 100s, and Modest Magneton—is devastating.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is a lesser used option that can take fast Pokemon such as Gengar and Zapdos out of the game. It is also Tyranitar's best option for dealing with Superachi. Thunder Wave will likely replace the Fighting-type coverage move, and it is best used alongside Rock Slide, as paraflinching Blissey is Tyranitar's best way of getting past it with no Fighting-type move available. Finally, Thunder is usable for catching Milotic and Suicune on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Tyranitar is a fast-paced offensive Pokemon that finds its best use on similarly offensive teams built around cultivating momentum. It is extremely well suited to supporting late-game physical threats such as Dragon Dance Salamence, Agility Metagross, and Aerodactyl, all of which highly appreciate a weakened—or even KOed—Skarmory or Swampert. Mixed Tyranitar works well alongside other breaking Pokemon that effectively make use of momentum; doubling up on mixed attackers with a mixed Metagross or Salamence is a great combination for exerting high pressure. This Tyranitar also functions well on a more specially oriented offense, in particularly alongside the likes of Supercele and Dugtrio. This triumvirate has some excellent synergies; Dugtrio can trap other Dugtrio that have revenge killed Celebi, allowing Tyranitar to later attack with impunity and not fear being trapped. Celebi is also excellent at using the small selection of Pokemon that wall this Tyranitar, namely Milotic and defensive Suicune, to comfortably set up with Calm Mind and threaten to sweep. Dugtrio removes Metagross after it has been dented with Fire Blast, preventing a threatening trade from the opponent via Explosion, and also removes slightly weakened Starmie, which can otherwise exploit the specially offensive vulnerabilities of many offensive teams that contain this Tyranitar. On the topic of special attackers, Tyranitar needs a partner that can weather a special hit once or twice from the likes of Starmie, offensive Suicune, and Zapdos. Out of the limited repertoire of special walls in the tier, this will more likely be Snorlax than Blissey, as Snorlax is better suited to the fast offensive teams that this Tyranitar works best on, surrendering less momentum than Blissey. Finally, mixed Tyranitar also goes well with Spikes, as its rainbow of coverage and surprise factor give it an easy time forcing switches and racking up Spikes damage. On offensive teams, the Spiker of choice is frequently Cloyster, but it can easily also be Skarmory.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar is a potent wallbreaker; while mixed Tyranitar is surgically precise at dismantling TSS teams, Choice Band Tyranitar is an all-around great wallbreaker that is adept at switching into and forcing out special walls and denting the tier's selection of defensive Water-types. Rock Slide exerts tremendous pressure on bulky Water-types that do not resist Rock, namely Milotic and Suicune. The odds of 2HKOing Milotic under sand are overwhelmingly high, forcing Milotic to switch; the definite 3HKO on Suicune forces it to use Rest early. Sometimes, Tyranitar even gets away scot-free by flinching through these walls. Once Milotic and Suicune cede momentum, it is no longer a straightforward task bringing them in. Choice Band Tyranitar is essentially the strongest set against bulky Water-types. Focus Punch is Choice Band Tyranitar's main coverage move, smashing Water-types, Skarmory, Flygon, and Metagross on the switch when the opponent respects the possibility of losing the Pokemon right in front of them with Rock Slide. Notably, it threatens to 2HKO Suicune under sand, and it 2HKOes Swampert as well. Earthquake nails Metagross on the switch, keeps Jirachi under control defensively, and hits opposing Tyranitar hard. Hidden Power Bug OHKOes Celebi and 2HKOes Claydol. An alternative in the fourth slot is Double-Edge, which eliminates prediction by providing neutral coverage against bulky Water-types, Flygon, and Claydol as they come in, and, compared to Focus Punch, it does not require Tyranitar to switch out after. Another alternative is Brick Break, which helps against Curse Snorlax, Blissey, and opposing Tyranitar. It is advised to have other measures for Celebi such as Dugtrio and Moltres if these alternative fillers are used.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs help Tyranitar maximize the odds of KOing its walls. Maximum Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outspeed Milotic and Suicune, most offensive Swampert, and most Metagross. Other options are a Jolly nature, unfortunately with a huge reduction in power, and at least 188 HP EVs to get to 387 HP, surviving Dugtrio and helping with checking offensive Jirachi and Zapdos, but the lack of Leftovers and the ease of taking chip damage through Spikes and attacks from even passive Pokemon frequently nullifies those benchmarks; this spread is perhaps most useful when Tyranitar is passed Wish.</p> <p>This set is ideally played with emphasis on aggressive prediction as a fearsome lead that is very effective against Zapdos and its switch-ins, coming in on slow Pokemon like Blissey and Snorlax, using Focus Punch or Earthquake on predicted switches to Rock-resistant Pokemon. While Focus Punch does a ton of damage should the opponent switch, using Earthquake as a midground hits both Metagross and Water-type switch-ins really hard while not revealing the move choice when Zapdos uses Baton Pass and mitigating the risk of locking into Focus Punch against a Snorlax that decides to stay in and attack. A single turn can put an offensive team's physical defenses out of commission just like that. Its weaknesses lie in its momentum losses and lack of bulk, so aggressive double switches are preferred to coming in and taking damage. One has to be far-sighted using this set as the game goes on; being Choice locked is dangerous against offensive teams and allows them to set up or gain momentum. Without any bulk investment or Leftovers, Tyranitar gets annihilated by Dugtrio, and its offensive abilities are severely compromised by paralysis from Blissey, Snorlax, and Jirachi. It is also prone to getting burned by Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Surprisingly, this offensive set fits best with more defensive partners; being Choice-locked allows for easier setup from foes, so the team needs to be safe against boosting threats such as Dragon Dance Salamence. Skarmory and Swampert can soak hits from Metagross and Salamence, both common pivots into Tyranitar's most potent moves. Choice Band Tyranitar works nicely with Spikes support for additional pressure on Water-types and Metagross. Blissey and Jirachi can pass Wishes to Tyranitar; furthermore, Blissey absorbs Will-O-Wisp from Gengar too. Spinners like Claydol and Starmie can prolong Tyranitar's longevity in light of lacking Leftovers. Zapdos can use Baton Pass to bring Tyranitar in safely on an anticipated switch to Blissey, Snorlax, or Celebi. Dugtrio can trap Steel-types, allowing Tyranitar to mindlessly lock in on Rock Slide should the opponent not have another Rock-resistant Pokemon. Porygon2 can counter trap opposing Dugtrio, while Choice Band Tyranitar is also great at threatening Curse Snorlax, which Porygon2 lets in a lot. Physical late-game threats such as Aerodactyl and Salamence appreciate weakened Water-types. Aerodactyl especially fits well on the same teams that Choice Band Tyranitar fits on, and being faster than Gengar and Starmie is really helpful on those kinds of teams. Moltres is a particularly synergistic partner. It draws Blissey in and forces it to recover, allowing Tyranitar an entry point, while Tyranitar's chip damage on Water-types gives Moltres an easier time.</p>"

  "Lugia": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Lugia is a very versatile Pokemon in the ADV Ubers metagame, able to act as an offensive or defensive threat. Its great natural bulk, Pressure, and many good utility moves let it work incredibly well as a catch-all physical wall. Defensively, it fits best on stall teams to shut down many threatening physical wallbreakers such as Groudon and Rayquaza. Lugia also has strong attacks in Aeroblast and Earthquake, allowing it to act as a good wallbreaker with Choice Band and its workable Attack stat. However, Lugia's typing leaves it susceptible to many prevalent offensive types in the metagame such as Electric, Ice, and Ghost from strong attackers like Latios, Deoxys-A, and Kyogre. The defensive set's reliance on Whirlwind to make progress can also be a double-edged sword; it stops setup sweepers before the endgame but exposes Lugia to Substitute sweepers and Immunity Snorlax if they are the last Pokemon remaining.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used on either set to threaten Pokemon like Rayquaza and physically defensive Groudon, but its lack of power overall makes it somewhat situational. Recover can heal the Choice Band set on the switches it forces, but it's not a favorable move to be locked into. Toxic can similarly be used in the last moveslot, but it is a risky move to click early, as Steel-types are the traditional Lugia answer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Forretress, Skarmory, Metagross, and Steelix are immune to everything defensive Lugia does aside from phazing them, and the former two can use it to set up Spikes. Many Steel-types also resist Choice Band Lugia's Aeroblast, but Earthquake can still threaten Metagross and Steelix. Skarmory completely walls Lugia and can threaten to use Toxic while also setting up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Equipped with Refresh, Latios and Latias are completely unbothered by defensive Lugia and threaten it out with powerful Thunders or Ice Beams. Both Pokemon can also survive even a Choice Band Shadow Ball from Lugia without any defensive investment.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl outspeeds Lugia and does massive damage with its strong STAB Rock Slide that can flinch Lugia down. Its Rock typing also lets it pivot into Choice Band Lugia and offensively pressure it.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong Thunders from Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, and Kyogre can heavily chip Lugia and threaten paralysis, breaking through its massive bulk quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Blissey, Skarmory, Ho-Oh, and opposing Lugia all commonly carry Toxic, which heavily limits Lugia's long-term defensive capabilities. Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Kyogre and Groudon does the same, letting Lugia get beat out by Rock Slide Groudon and Roar Kyogre, as well as others like Heracross.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh can tank even Choice Band Aeroblast and use Pressure to stall Lugia out of moves to threaten it. Ho-Oh also carries Toxic and Sacred Fire commonly, threatening Lugia with a very debilitating status.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Fast Taunt users such as Deoxys-S, Gengar, and Mewtwo completely shut down defensive Lugia; however, they don't bother Choice Band sets.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Reflect and Whirlwind let Lugia be an effective stop to physical wallbreakers like Groudon, Heracross, and Rayquaza, using Reflect on their attacking moves to take more hits and phazing setup variants that boost too high for even Reflect to handle. Toxic is the main way Lugia makes progress, alongside Whirlwind. Poisoning foes like Ho-Oh severely reduces their longevity, and residual damage from Whirlwind with Spikes makes up for Lugia running no attacking moves. 96 Speed EVs allow Lugia to outrun maximum Speed base 90s with a neutral nature such as Groudon and Kyogre, as well as important slower foes such as Adamant Heracross. Lugia can also afford to run less Speed in favor of a tankier set, with only 16 Speed EVs being needed to outrun and set up Reflect against a -1 Speed Snorlax if Lugia gets paralyzed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lugia fits best on very bulky team structures that utilize its slow pace and walling abilities while defensively covering for its shortcomings. It has multiple exploitable weaknesses to common attacking types like Ghost, Electric, and Ice while also lacking any Special Defense investment. Blissey is a strong switch-in to special attackers like Kyogre, Latios, and Latias, can absorb status from Pokemon like defensive Ho-Oh, and can even provide Lugia with incredible Aromatherapy support. Blissey's Light Screen also lets Lugia take essentially any hit and respond with Toxic or Whirlwind, something important in the Calm Mind Kyogre matchup. Forretress is practically mandatory so Whirlwind can force progress with Spikes. It also provides a Ghost resistance to help against Pokemon like Choice Band Deoxys-A, which can overwhelm even Lugia. Deoxys-D is a good switch-in to most other strong special attacking Psychic-types like Latios and Latias, Mewtwo, and Petaya Berry Deoxys-A, which Lugia cannot handle itself. It also provides the crucial Spikes support Lugia wants and is another Pressure user, allowing for easier PP stalling against opposing defensive teams. Snorlax is one of the better pivots into Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo and has Immunity to cover for Lugia's terrible weakness to Toxic, making it a strong partner as well.</p>"

Aeroblast is a strong STAB move and is used most, breaking past most Pokemon that don't resist it. Shadow Ball is used to hit bulky Latias the hardest as well as dent opposing Lugia and Dusclops, which can Pressure stall Aeroblast. Earthquake is needed to threaten Metagross, and it also covers more niche Pokemon like Tyranitar and Steelix. Whirlwind can be a last-ditch effort against setup sweepers, using Lugia's massive natural bulk to stomach a hit and remove a threat like boosted Groudon in a pinch. The Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are needed to outspeed Modest Latias and Latios, and Lugia needs maximum Attack investment for power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton is an excellent partner for Lugia, removing Steel-types like Forretress and Skarmory to let it more easily spam Aeroblast. Latios and Latias provide Lugia with a lot of support by switching into Kyogre, which can threaten Lugia with Thunder, as well as being offensive but sturdier Groudon checks in combination with Lugia soft checking it. Deoxys-A appreciates Lugia's ability to bait in and chip Steel-types like Forretress and Metagross, which can take a few hits from Deoxys-A, and Lugia benefits from Deoxys-A baiting in Skarmory, which Lugia can't break with any attack. Fire-type coverage on Pokemon like Snorlax and Metagross in sun is also good for baiting in and weakening Steel-types like Forretress and opposing Metagross.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Ho-Oh is a seriously underrated Uber. 50% burn is nothing to play with. It is an extreme staller, as well, with Recover, 106 base HP, and 154 base Special Defense. The trick to Ho-Oh is to try and burn any physical attackers you can, and then use your massive Special Defense to keep you alive on that front. Unlike Lugia, who, with a Calm Mind set, likes some Defense EVs and tries to boost up in the face of physical attackers, Ho-Oh has the ability to severely cripple them. However, its mediocre Speed (tied with Kyogre, Groudon, and Deoxys-D as the slowest Uber) is what holds it back. It has trouble with the physical attackers, because they're likely faster and carry Rock Slide, and its weaknesses to Thunder, Thunderbolt, and Surf hurts its ability to wall special hits. Ho-Oh should always be used with Groudon. Kyogre is one of the most common Pokemon in Ubers, and you don't want Drizzle blocking your Sacred Fire. With Groudon, you can overwrite Drizzle with Drought to boost your Sacred Fire instead of weaken it. This also makes enemy Surfs be at half power, and Thunder gets 50% accuracy.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Whirlwind can make life hell for a lot of Pokemon, as it can Calm Mind and Whirlwind your Calm Mind's away. With Special Defense, you can even survive a hit or two from Kyogre. Safeguard + Recover owns Blissey. Reflect can help Ho-Oh take physical attacks better. Substitute is also of mention, since Ho-Oh can make 101 HP Substitutes for Deoxys-D and Blissey. Solar Beam has no charge up turns in the sun, but between Sacred Fire and Thunder(bolt), along with the threat of Kyogre or Rayquaza switching in and removing your sunlight, when are you going to use it?</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Max Special Attack for the first set, max Attack for the Choice Band set.</p> <p>For a fast sweeper, you'll want to make it 306 Speed (252 EVs with a +Speed nature). This ties at worst with Groudon, who is very important to outrun. This also often makes it faster than Rayquaza, who also usually has Rock Slide. If you can go before either of them, you can OHKO Groudon, or burn Rayquaza, thus keeping you safe from their Rock Slides.</p> <p>Tankish versions need more Special Defense and HP, which isn't as bad as it sounds. Ho-Oh is tied for Speed with Deoxys-D, Groudon and Kyogre, making it the slowest uber. It's never going to outspeed Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, almost any Latios or Latias, and will rarely beat Lugia, no matter how much Speed it has. It's faster than Metagross, too, since Metagross usually just pumps HP and Defense in place of Speed. Since Deoxys-D never has more than 24 or so Speed EVs for Tyranitar (and even that's considered fast), Speed EVs are really just to beat out enemy Ho-Oh, Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. Rayquaza has a higher base Speed, and will sometimes go Jolly to give those Latias and Latios that only run 307 Speed a scare with Choice Band Hidden Power Bug / Hidden Power Ghost, and you can only tie with Kyogre and Groudon. For this reason, Speed EVs aren't essential. Instead, you could run a 252 HP, 252 Attack, 4 Special Defense spread, as outlined in the Choice Band set, to be able to take more hits from the Pokemon that are faster than you anyway, and just try burning physical attackers on the switch. Of course, if you have Substitute, you need at least 204 HP EVs for 404 HP, allowing 101 HP Substitutes, which are unbreakable by Night Shade and Seismic Toss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kyogre can come on Sacred Fire most any time, as burning isn't nearly as bad as any other status to it, and absolutely loves Solar Beam, because it makes Solar Beam charge. Latias and Latios resist Fire and Electric, and usually have an Electric move, themselves. Tyranitar resists Sacred Fire, and gets STAB Rock, but doesn't like to be burned. Rayquaza Air Locks Sunny Day and also resists Fire, but unless it's a pure special version, it has to beware of the burn, too. Blissey and Deoxys-D can Paralyze / Toxic non-Safeguarders or Substituters. All of these should watch out for the Choice Band version, especially low defense Blissey, except for Rayquaza, unless Ho-Oh has Hidden Power Rock, in which case even Rayquaza isn't safe.</p>",

Hidden Power Flying is a safe move to use as it hits almost everything in the uber metagame with at least neutral damage except for Metagross and the rare Skarmory, both of which rarely switch in for fear of Sacred Fire. However, Shadow Ball hits more things super effective, and Earthquake has roughly the same power (5 less, with STAB) as Hidden Power Flying, so it would primarily be for when you can't decide between trying to hit Rayquaza or Kyogre, or something. Hidden Power Rock, however, allows you to OHKO enemy Ho-Oh, and possibly OHKO Rayquaza. Hidden Power Rock has more uses that aren't covered by your other moves better, but Hidden Power Flying is safer if you are having trouble predicting.</p>"}

  "Celebi": {
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Celebi is one of the most versatile Pokemon in ADV OU. With high stats across the board, it can easily run physically and specially defensive sets, momentum-maintaining Baton Pass sets with Calm Mind or Swords Dance, a special sweeper set, or a Substitute + Baton Pass set.</p> <p>Defensively, Natural Cure and crucial resistances to Electric-, Water-, Ground- and Fighting-type attacks allow it to pivot safely into Zapdos, Jolteon, Magneton, Swampert, defensive Suicune, Claydol, and Breloom without Hidden Power Bug and into status moves from Blissey, Snorlax, Defensive Jirachi, Milotic, and Porygon2. Leech Seed is the best move defensive Celebi can offer, allowing it to not only soften the impact of incoming threats but also chip bulky Pokemon into KO range of its teammates.</p> <p>Offensively, it is one of the few pivots that can easily turn the tides against Zapdos and Swampert by absorbing Thunderbolt or Hydro Pump, setting up, and Baton Passing out; it is perhaps the only common and reliable stat boost passer in the game. Celebi as a sweeper itself is often also very dangerous in an unconventional way, because its coverage and natural bulk allow it to challenge checks to more passive sets like Tyranitar, Salamence, and Metagross, while its ability to heal from Giga Drain may very well help to win the war against Snorlax and Blissey.</p> <p>Unfortunately, while Celebi's typing offers all its useful resistances, it is also the root of all its flaws. Weaknesses to very common attacking types like Flying, Fire, and Bug invite all sorts of threats like Salamence, Moltres, and Heracross, while its need to repeatedly use Recover in the face of Ice Beam to gain back a substantial amount of HP makes it very susceptible to freeze and critical hits. Its four-fold Bug weakness makes it susceptible to being trapped by Dugtrio, and its Dark weakness makes Pursuit Tyranitar a huge threat to any Celebi without Baton Pass. While Celebi can often be considered a special wall, its inability to pressure Skarmory and weaker special bulk make it relatively weaker to Spikes and sand than Blissey.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Celebi can really exist anywhere on the spectrum of defense to offense. The sets listed above are pretty much divided into day and night, but mid-paced Celebi sets are also entirely feasible on the right team. A set of Calm Mind, Leech Seed, and two of Psychic, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power Fire can be used with the appropriate trappers to exert a lot of pressure in the face of Blissey and Snorlax. Alternatively, Recover / Leech Seed / two attacks on an offensive set gives Celebi some defensive utility without compromising its ability to hit threatening switch-ins. Calm Mind / Leech Seed / Psychic / Baton Pass with Magneton support can be really helpful for forcing switches and getting the right foe in so that pass targets have an easier time, and this set also allows Celebi to set up in the face of Blissey and Snorlax. Toxic on the utility set permanently cripples a ton of Celebi's checks, especially Salamence, Moltres, and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Ice can be used on offensive Celebi to nab the surprise KO on Salamence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Flying-types</strong>: Salamence, Gyarados, and Aerodactyl can switch in safely on any of Celebi's sets and set up or threaten to hit Celebi very hard with a Choice Band-boosted attack. They cannot, however, take repeated hits of Psychic indefinitely, and mixed Salamence in particular struggles to break past Calm Mind Celebi. Note that none of these are foolproof answers to Baton Pass Celebi carrying boosts, as faster Celebi can outspeed them before taking any damage, and slower Celebi can be EVed to take a hit before passing the boosts out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Moltres and Charizard either OHKO many Celebi sets or come very close to doing so and are good pivots against defensive Celebi. Offensive Celebi can, however, beat Moltres and slower Charizard if it uses Calm Mind on the switch, and Baton Pass Celebi can safely pivot out by outspeeding either or tanking a hit if Moltres does not have Roar. Houndoom is a rare check that works in the same vein but can also use Pursuit to catch Celebi switching out.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Threats</strong>: Metagross and Tyranitar are usually able to exert enough pressure on defensive Celebi before it can take them out with its coverage moves. They won't stop Celebi from Baton Passing out its boosts, but Metagross can at least use Explosion, and Tyranitar can at least set up on the target with Dragon Dance. Roar Tyranitar can also stop a pass, but it is highly unreliable due to many Celebi packing Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Skarmory takes next to nothing from defensive Celebi's attacks. It can also stop Celebi from passing boosts while tanking Hidden Power Fire, though that is not an ideal position because it forces Skarmory to take damage without laying Spikes. Roar Zapdos and Moltres can easily phaze Celebi that don't have a move to hit them hard, like Psychic or Ancient Power.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can come in on weakened Celebi to trap and finish it off with Hidden Power Bug. Spikes and Toxic help to induce the chip needed for the KO.</p> <p><strong>Bug-type Moves</strong>: Heracross and Flygon don't switch in so well but can threaten to OHKO or 2HKO back with Megahorn and Hidden Power Bug, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Regice and Jynx hit Celebi very hard and undermine Celebi's role as a special tank as well as that of the Zapdos and Celebi core as a specially defensive core. These Ice-types, however, do not stop boosts and should be wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Skarmory and Forretress can freely set up Spikes on defensive Celebi to erode its defensive capabilities significantly. Celebi frequently relies on Recover to make progress against attacks that do less than 50% damage, so attacks crossing that threshold with Spikes damage place Celebi into unfavorable Recover loops.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Utility Celebi is unique in the metagame as a mixed wall that can deal with Electric-types, Water-types, and Snorlax as well as exert constant pressure with Leech Seed and the threat of trapper support.</p> <p>Leech Seed and Celebi's accompanying bulk are the main features of this set. Leech Seed is a move with both offensive and defensive utility that allows Celebi to chip a number of Pokemon while maintaining momentum via passive recovery for itself or its teammates. Offensively, the chip damage is excellent at wearing down bulky physical tanks, potentially putting Metagross and Tyranitar into OHKO range of boosted Salamence's, Aerodactyl's, and Dugtrio's Earthquake. It can also place Tyranitar into OHKO range of defensive Metagross and potentially into 2HKO range of Snorlax's Earthquake. Leech Seed is also excellent at wearing down Flying-types because of their lack of recovery and, in some cases, lack of sand immunity, allowing Water-types to threaten weakened Zapdos more easily, putting Moltres into 2HKO range of Pursuit Tyranitar, and placing Skarmory into OHKO range of Timid Magneton. Defensively, Leech Seed allows Claydol to keep spinning in the face of Drill Peck Skarmory, forcing Skarmory to switch out first, hence leaving no Spikes on the field. It is also serves to check Suicune and Snorlax by forcing them to Rest repeatedly, allowing a teammate to exploit those free turns. Finally, Leech Seed's passive recovery and ability to force switches can either provide Choice Band users like Salamence and Heracross with some added longevity or let them switch in freely.</p> <p>Recover allows Celebi to stick around for a long time and is especially needed in the face of repeated hits from Snorlax; Ice-type coverage from Water-types, Zapdos, and Gengar; Will-O-Wisp from Gengar; and Toxic from Blissey, Milotic, Swampert, and Zapdos. Celebi is bulky and does not have to use Recover frequently if it pivots only into resisted attacks. If the opponent has Dugtrio, though, Celebi should be kept near full HP through Recover, even though it can be tempting to maintain the pressure with repeated Leech Seeds.</p> <p>Psychic hits Gengar very hard, which is important because many teams rely exclusively on Celebi to pivot into its Will-O-Wisp. It also makes progress against many switch-ins, like Salamence, Moltres, Aerodactyl, Heracross, Flygon, and Heracross, and helps Celebi deal with Zapdos a bit more easily. Although most Zapdos are unable to severely threaten Celebi, Leech Seed's PP can easily be drained through Zapdos's Pressure, and the occasional Substitute Zapdos can completely turn the tables on Celebi lacking Psychic.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass allows Celebi to OHKO Dugtrio with minimal Special Attack investment, hits Tyranitar hard, and allows Celebi to be a Starmie pivot. On Spikes teams, it allows Celebi to threaten the two common spinners—Claydol and Starmie—should they attempt to spin on Celebi. Hidden Power Grass is mostly run when Celebi is not paired with Dugtrio or Porygon2. When paired with either, the preferred move is Baton Pass, as Celebi can scout for a Tyranitar or Dugtrio switch-in and pass out to either trapper. If Celebi is at full HP, it can also tank Hidden Power Bug and trap opposing Dugtrio by passing to one's own Dugtrio. When used with Magneton, Baton Pass also helps to catch Skarmory.</p> <p>As for less commonly used moves, Substitute in conjunction with Leech Seed and Baton Pass makes Celebi adept at inducing chip damage, eases trapping, and generates free turns for huge threats like Aerodactyl. Reflect neuters Metagross's Explosion and Snorlax's Self-Destruct, protecting one's bulky Water-types and also Celebi itself. Reflect also provides a crucial setup turn for sweepers like Curse Snorlax and Dragon Dance Salamence. Heal Bell can be helpful for teammates with Rest like Suicune, Snorlax, and Zapdos. Light Screen helps Forretress and Skarmory avoid being trapped and taken out by Magneton; Forretress can then KO back with Earthquake, while Skarmory can phaze Magneton and a reverse trap can be set with Dugtrio later on. Perish Song is a phazing move that stops Calm Mind users in their tracks and also deals with bulky setup sweepers in the endgame. The downside to using these alternative moves is that dropping a STAB move or Baton Pass for any of them compromises Celebi's ability to deal with both Gengar and Dugtrio at the same time. Gengar is easier to deal with than Dugtrio because Celebi can simply be paired with a Pursuit trapper, so Hidden Power Grass is frequently the attacking move kept when Celebi sports these alternate moves.</p> <p>The EVs are fashioned to survive Choice Band Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Bug and Salamence's Hidden Power Flying in sand, and they let Celebi comfortably survive Hidden Power Bug from Dugtrio. 40 Special Attack EVs are required to OHKO Dugtrio with Hidden Power Grass; variants lacking the said move can place the EVs in Special Defense or Speed. 32 Speed EVs are required to outrun all Tyranitar. Celebi can go for a faster benchmark like 136 Speed EVs, which gets the jump on Adamant Heracross and most offensive Suicune. Substitute Celebi can use a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe with a Timid nature to survive Adamant Dugtrio while outrunning Timid Moltres and neutral-natured Salamence, Zapdos, Flygon, and Charizard. With this spread, Celebi can also Baton Pass out of a significant number of Taunt Gengar that are EVed to survive Pursuit Tyranitar under sand and Dragon Dance Salamence. If Celebi is important as a special wall, a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 40 SpA / 120 SpD / 32 Spe with a Calm nature can be used; this spread also allows Celebi to survive Adamant Dugtrio's Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p>The key to using Celebi successfully is to generate entry opportunities for strong threats and trappers and to rack up enough chip damage to allow sweepers to run their course. Try to use Leech Seed to force switches and heal passively so that powerful threats can enter the field while taking minimum damage, but be careful to combine that with smart pivoting so as not to burn through Leech Seed's PP too quickly; common Leech Seed targets, especially Pokemon with Pressure like Zapdos and Suicune, tend to have the bulk to last quite a while. Conserving PP allows Celebi to be more threatening throughout the game, especially in the closing stages. Also, take advantage of Celebi drawing in many trappable checks, like Tyranitar, Metagross, Dugtrio, and Skarmory, especially by using Baton Pass if it is run. Finally, an aggressive sequence of consecutive Leech Seeds, especially with Spikes, can generate a lot of chip damage without having Celebi take any damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trappers are very common partners to utility Celebi. Magneton gets rid of Skarmory, which easily comes in and sets up Spikes on any variant of utility Celebi. Leech Seed also has nifty synergy with Substitute Magneton, which can trap and indefinitely wear down seeded Metagross and defensive Jirachi. Dugtrio traps chipped Tyranitar, Metagross, and opposing Celebi and can also take out opposing Dugtrio locked into Hidden Power Bug either from KOing or getting Baton Passed out of by Celebi. While Dugtrio does not directly help with Spikes control, taking out the bulky offensive Pokemon that exploit Celebi with Spikes around can allow Celebi to function reasonably well even under Spikes. Porygon2 is also a splendid partner that removes opposing Dugtrio and can indefinitely wall Salamence, one of the few common checks to Celebi that cannot be removed easily by trapping. Pursuit Tyranitar frees up Celebi to use a filler move instead of Psychic and can wear down Choice Band Salamence and Aerodactyl locked into a resisted move.</p> <p>Winning the Spikes war is one option for teams using utility Celebi. Bulky Spikers like Skarmory and Forretress are great for exploiting Celebi's switch forcing abilities. Together with Leech Seed, Spikes can generate a lot of chip damage for a sweeper like Aerodactyl to clean up the opposing team. Defensively, these Pokemon also help Celebi to deal with physical Metagross and Salamence. Claydol spins Spikes away, which is useful given Celebi's extraordinary propensity to attract Skarmory, and it can make use of Leech Seed's healing to stand its ground against Drill Peck Skarmory. Flygon's Spikes immunity and role as an Electric- and Rock-type check also help to compensate for Celebi's Skarmory attracting tendencies.</p> <p>Secondary special walls with a niche of their own, like Curse Snorlax and Rest Zapdos, make the team more robust against special attacks while offering their own utility. Celebi acts as a mid-game special wall, protecting Snorlax from taking chip so that it has the HP to perform a Curse sweep, while Snorlax can support Celebi should it falter against more potent special threats like Starmie, Calm Mind Suicune, Jirachi, and Celebi. Rest Zapdos helps Celebi deal with Suicune and other special threats, especially when Spikes are present, and can phaze Calm Mind Celebi.</p> <p>Hard-hitting physical Pokemon, like Heracross and Choice Band Salamence, benefit from the entry or healing opportunities presented by Celebi's Leech Seed and from their mutual synergy with trappers. Heracross batters down Salamence, which Celebi can threaten later with Psychic, and Celebi can absorb Thunderbolt from Zapdos should it be the opponent's Heracross check. Heracross also benefits from Celebi synergistically luring in Dugtrio to be revenge killed by one's own Dugtrio. Salamence provides robust defensive utility against Heracross and draws in Swampert and Zapdos, which Celebi can easily pivot in on.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types are appreciated teammates, as Celebi's checks are mostly physical attackers. Milotic is a physical and mixed wall that can continuously soak up hits from Salamence, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Flygon, which love coming in on Celebi. Suicune is less robust than Milotic, but it can make full use of Leech Seed's recovery to provide some mid-game utility and play a more targeted endgame through a Calm Mind sweep. These Water-types benefit from the Dugtrio synergy, which reduces the heavy burden of Tyranitar and Metagross using unresisted Rock Slide or Explosion on them. Using Swampert might be tempting, but the prevalence of Fire-types with Grass-type coverage makes the Celebi + Swampert core unreliable for the long haul, and such cores must win the game through aggressive plays and trades on the more offensive side of the team.</p> <p>Finally, as Celebi has a propensity to wear down physically defensive Pokemon, sweepers like Aerodactyl, Dragon Dance Salamence, Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Agility Metagross are all fine partners for taking down weakened teams.</p>"

        "Calm Mind + Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is an excellent offensive momentum reverser that can support both wallbreakers and sweepers. It is one of the few Pokemon on offense teams that can shrug off Zapdos's Thunderbolt and offensive Swampert's Hydro Pump and pressure the opponent by setting up. Its coverage moves hit phazers hard and force opposing Metagross and Snorlax to navigate a tricky decision of sacrificing themselves with Explosion or Self-Destruct, lest they miss their chance to take out an attacking Celebi or waste the sacrifice on an unfavorable target.</p> <p>Calm Mind does not merely function as a stat boost for passing, though—it provides Celebi with both offensive and defensive utility as well. Boosted Giga Drain allows Celebi to stay in on a Tyranitar switch-in and threaten to 2HKO it. The recovery allows Celebi to be brought back to full HP from any chip damage it might have received from pivoting in, giving it better survivability against Hidden Power Bug from Tyranitar. The boost also allows Celebi to OHKO Starmie under sand with Giga Drain, protecting it from the latter's Ice Beam. Boosted Giga Drain also OHKOes Dugtrio and heals back whatever HP was lost from taking a Hidden Power Bug, which might otherwise place Celebi into sand range. Finally, Giga Drain allows Celebi to take down any Swampert or Suicune that are brave enough to stay in to phaze or continue chipping down Celebi. Psychic is a notable alternative that allows Celebi to hit Taunt Gengar, Moltres, Roar Zapdos, Salamence, Heracross, Flygon, and Charizard hard, especially after a Calm Mind boost. Note also that the Special Defense boost protects Celebi from Moltres and mixed Salamence too. Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory hard, forcing it to waste a turn phazing Celebi so that no Spikes are laid on the field, and threatens Metagross. It also prevents Jirachi and other Celebi from checking this set easily by engaging in a Calm Mind war.</p> <p>Baton Pass is mostly used for passing Calm Mind boosts, but it can also be used without any to aid Dugtrio or Porygon2 in trapping incoming Metagross, Tyranitar, or Dugtrio. After all, the last thing a Baton Pass Celebi team wants is Metagross using a free Explosion or Tyranitar setting up on the Baton Pass target.</p> <p>All EVs spreads come with tradeoffs. The listed EVs give boosted Celebi good odds to 2HKO bulky Tyranitar and the assured OHKO on offensive Starmie in sand while outspeeding Timid Moltres and Adamant Salamence. They also give Celebi a chance to OHKO Dugtrio without a boost. The HP investment helps Celebi to survive Hidden Power Bug from Jolly Dugtrio and provides extra bulk against Ice-type coverage. Alternatively, one can place the Special Attack EVs into Defense to always survive Adamant Tyranitar's Hidden Power Bug under sand at the expense of all the odds and assurances above. A spread of 76 HP / 252 SpA / 180 Spe can be used to heavily pressure Skarmory with an almost assured 2HKO and turns all the above rolls into certainties. However, such a set is likely to be OHKOed by Hidden Power Bug from Dugtrio and Tyranitar. Finally, one can even lower the Speed investment to the level of outspeeding Adamant Heracross in order to strengthen Special Attack, resulting in a spread of 252 HP / 120 SpA / 136 Spe. This turns the offensive rolls into certainties without sacrificing bulk; it is especially useful when paired with Agility + Baton Pass Zapdos to make up for Celebi's lack of Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi is usually found on special and mixed offense teams. The key to choosing recipients for the Calm Mind boost is understanding which targets pivot nicely into Celebi's checks. The hard-hitting checks that Celebi cannot deal with reliably using its coverage moves fall into three categories: bulky physical threats such as Metagross, Tyranitar, and Snorlax; physical Flying-types such as Salamence and Aerodactyl; and Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard. Additionally, Blissey is a counter that falls into none of these categories.</p> <p>On mixed offense teams, one can consider the following Baton Pass targets. Offensive Swampert comes in safely on Metagross, Tyranitar, and Salamence lacking Choice Band, as well as on Thunder Wave Blissey. A Calm Mind boost allows Swampert to OHKO Tyranitar with Hydro Pump, as well as Metagross while in Torrent range. The Special Defense boost also prevents Swampert from getting 2HKOed by Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar, and if Swampert comes in at full HP, it can also prevent mixed Salamence from OHKOing it with Hidden Power Grass. Should Swampert enter the game first, it easily lures in Zapdos, which lets Celebi switch in easily. Fire-types like Charizard and Moltres are high-pressure wallbreaking pivots into Metagross that can also threaten Skarmory should the opponent send it in as Celebi Baton Passes out. Mixed Metagross is a nice Snorlax and Blissey pivot that can 2HKO Swampert with Psychic after a boost. Mixed Tyranitar and Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar can also pivot into Snorlax; a Calm Mind boost allows mixed Tyranitar to often OHKO Swampert and Metagross and allows Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar to comfortably 2HKO Swampert without worrying about getting taken out by Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Zapdos is a pretty unique partner, as it has Baton Pass and Agility. Baton Pass allows it to maintain boosts by sending them to a teammate and can be used with or without Agility. Just having Baton Pass allows Zapdos to be a specially offensive Baton Pass target that can keep the boost alive for a longer period of time should Celebi get battered down while boosting, and Zapdos will not be concerned with being walled when it can pass the boosts to a mixed wallbreaker. While having Baton Pass Zapdos is itself great, Agility takes the synergy to a whole new level. Celebi with a Speed boost no longer gets revenge killed by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Salamence, and the pairing allows Celebi to get by with lower Speed investment. Conversely, Agility and Calm Mind boosts allow Zapdos to be a great late-game sweeper, and if the time is not ripe, it can pass the boosts to mixed Swampert or mixed Metagross, annihilating potential checks and revenge killers like Gengar, Zapdos, mixed Salamence, Starmie, Dugtrio, and Aerodactyl. Natural Cure on Celebi is a subtle but important part of passing Speed; Thunder Wave is a common measure for negating Speed boosts, so Zapdos can first pass the boost to Celebi, which then heals itself of the paralysis by passing out. Since paralyzed Celebi is usually the slower Pokemon on the field, the intended target receives the boosts without ever taking a scratch. Salac Berry + Substitute Zapdos is another possibility for acquiring the Speed boost that eases the prediction-based sequences of Swampert to Snorlax and allows Zapdos to still get the boost in the face of an onslaught of attacks that would have KOed Zapdos trying to squeeze off an Agility boost.</p> <p>On special offense teams, one can use the following Baton Pass targets instead. Calm Mind Suicune, Jirachi, and Raikou all appreciate boosts as a head start in the attempt to muscle through Blissey. Suicune acts as a pivot into Fire-types and physical attackers, and upon Celebi's first entry, it can use the fear of Celebi's potential Psychic pressuring Moltres to attack directly to avoid Will-O-Wisp. Jirachi acts as a much-needed source of Rock resistance and is the most reliable Calm Mind user to take down Blissey lacking Thunder Wave and Snorlax. Porygon2 can trap Dugtrio, and though it does not have much offensive presence, it can come in indefinitely on Salamence's Hidden Power Flying. Regice is a great secondary special check to Zapdos, Suicune, and Starmie, and with Calm Mind boosts, it really pressures Blissey and Snorlax to come in and take the Explosion. The chip damage that Regice can induce on Tyranitar and Metagross is also highly appreciated by the other Calm Mind users. Kingdra can use a boost to nail the much-appreciated OHKOs on Zapdos, Gengar, and Skarmory with Hydro Pump. Starmie can also take advantage of a boost, and its Speed helps to maintain the team's momentum by minimizing revenge kill opportunities after being passed a boost.</p> <p>Finally, Dugtrio is a fine partner on any sort of team, and here it can remove Metagross and Tyranitar or trade Celebi with them, revenge kill opposing Dugtrio, and use the Special Defense boosts to safely take Blissey's Ice Beams to possibly 2HKO with Earthquake.</p>"

        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Offensive Celebi plays a unique role in ADV OU as a special sweeper and mixed wallbreaker. Although it is not as fast as Starmie and needs at least a turn to set up, it notably differs from other sweepers in that it frequently has the bulk to trade KOs with its checks, making it great at maintaining momentum. Unlike most special sweepers, many of its checks are physically bulky, allowing Celebi also to function as a wallbreaker for physically offensive Pokemon.</p> <p>With a boost, Giga Drain 2HKOes Tyranitar, Suicune, Claydol, and possibly Milotic, and it OHKOes Starmie, Dugtrio, and Swampert. Don't underestimate Giga Drain's healing abilities—it can increase Celebi's odds of surviving being trapped by Dugtrio by bringing it back to full HP after a KO as well as healing back the damage Dugtrio did to it, keeping Celebi out of sand KO range. Giga Drain's regeneration also helps Celebi survive Hidden Power Bug from Tyranitar and helps it when facing fast foes like Starmie. Notably, with enough boosts, Giga Drain in conjunction with Psychic gives Celebi a way to muscle past Blissey lacking a status move. Again requiring a boost, Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Metagross, often 2HKOes Skarmory, helps in tussles against Celebi and Jirachi, and usually OHKOes Forretress and Magneton. Psychic is Celebi's strongest STAB move and is the primary move used to wear down Snorlax and Blissey. With a boost, it also 2HKOes airborne Pokemon—Salamence, offensive Zapdos, Moltres, and Flygon—that would check or phaze Celebi, and it OHKOes Gengar and the Fighting-types Heracross and Breloom.</p> <p>Offensive Celebi can be used either mid-game or late-game. As a mid-game wallbreaker, bring it in against Zapdos or Swampert, and use it to trade KOs with mixed Salamence, Moltres, Snorlax, Metagross, and Tyranitar. It also prevents Skarmory from setting up Spikes by forcing it to phaze Celebi. With the aforementioned Pokemon worn down or removed, Celebi can also sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Celebi fits mostly on special offense teams, especially in conjunction with Calm Mind users, but can sometimes be used with Spikes. Ironically, it can also fit on physically offensive teams due to its ability to trade KOs with physical tanks like Tyranitar, Metagross, and Salamence, wear down Skarmory, get ahead of and take out Moltres, and pivot into Gengar's Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Dugtrio is a useful partner, and it is almost mandatory on special offense. It revenge kills opposing Dugtrio that end up trapping Celebi and can remove checks like Blissey, chipped Tyranitar and Metagross, and weakened Snorlax.</p> <p>Offensive Jirachi is an excellent partner. With almost the same coverage and natural bulk and shared Calm Mind usage, Jirachi is a Celebi lookalike. They share essentially all their checks, and a trade with one paves the way for the other to sweep. Speaking of trading checks, one common way to eliminate Dugtrio should Jirachi go down first is Porygon2, which also indefinitely checks Dragon Dance Salamence. Offensive Suicune is also an offensive pivot for Dragon Dance Salamence on Calm Mind teams. With Celebi around, Regice is a good secondary special check to Zapdos, Starmie, and Suicune that can also lure in and use Explosion on Blissey and Snorlax without worrying too much about compromising the team's special bulk. Regice also draws in and wears down Tyranitar and Metagross, which can be helpful for turning Celebi's 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p> <p>Offensive Celebi can be used on some Spikes teams too. Aggressive setters like Taunt Skarmory and Cloyster are possible partners. Gengar's spinblocking abilities are always useful with Spikes, but defensive Gengar also helps the team survive against Dragon Dance Salamence, while offensive Gengar's rainbow of coverage can provide the chip needed for Celebi to finish the opposing team off. Celebi is always a nice Aerodactyl partner, as it turns the tide on Electric- and Water-types. However, using offensive Celebi instead of defensive Celebi also makes Skarmory and Cloyster's weakness to Electric-types more pronounced, so having Aerodactyl to exert immense pressure on Zapdos is helpful.</p>"
        },
        "Leech Seed + 3 Attacks": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Leech Seed + 3 Attacks Celebi combines the coverage of offensive Calm Mind sets with the ability to force switches and heal in Leech Seed. This Celebi set takes advantage of the huge HP stat of special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax to potentially force them out to hit their teammates with strong coverage. Despite getting 3HKOed by Blissey’s Ice Beam, getting potentially even 2HKOed by Snorlax’s Shadow Ball, and despising potential paralysis or poison, hitting them with Leech Seed is often enough to force them out. Even without much defensive investment, Celebi is still bulky enough to switch into offensive Zapdos’s Thunderbolt and Swampert’s Hydro Pump, allowing it to heal off the damage with Leech Seed as it threatens them out.</p> <p>Giga Drain is highly valuable on Celebi to OHKO Swampert and Dugtrio, as well as potentially 2HKO Tyranitar and frailer Water-types such as Starmie. It also threatens Milotic and Suicune, but beware of its 8 PP. Giga Drain in conjunction with Leech Seed also helps keep Celebi healthy. Hidden Power Fire hits Skarmory, Metagross, Forretress, Jirachi, and opposing Celebi hard. While it only 3HKOes Skarmory, Metagross, and Jirachi, Leech Seed can potentially chip them into KO range. Psychic rounds off its coverage, pressuring Pokemon such as Gengar, Moltres, Zapdos, Flygon, Heracross, Salamence, and Charizard. Generally, offensive versions of these Pokemon are 2HKOed, while defensive versions are outsped and at least 3HKOed and none of them enjoy Leech Seed. The additional coverage is often surprising alongside Leech Seed, allowing Celebi to hit them hard with its coverage.</p> <p>Celebi has lots of possible EV spreads. As Celebi is pretty close to KO thresholds on Pokemon such as 2HKOing Tyranitar with Giga Drain, 2HKOing Skarmory with Hidden Power Fire, and 2HKOing Moltres with Psychic, it often runs maximum Special Attack EVs. To facilitate threatening Moltres, Heracross, slower Zapdos, and slower Salamence, the given EV spread outspeeds Moltres and neutral-natured Zapdos and Salamence. As Celebi is most often taking special hits such as Blissey’s Ice Beam, Swampert’s Ice Beam, and Gengar’s Ice Punch, the remaining EVs are put in Special Defense to help Celebi survive these attacks more easily. Beware that Dugtrio will almost always OHKO Celebi with Hidden Power Bug, however. The choice of a Modest or Timid nature depends on how valuable it is to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Salamence, Timid Moltres, and offensive Flygon. Modest is often preferred to pressure Skarmory more easily. There are many other choices, however. An example faster EV spread is 168 SpA / 160 SpD / 180 Spe with a Timid nature to outspeed up to Timid Moltres and avoid the 2HKO after Spikes to Modest Blissey’s Ice Beam. If Speed isn’t as important, Celebi can invest as low as 32 Speed EVs with an EV spread of 252 HP / 224 SpA / 32 Spe to outspeed positive-natured Tyranitar and be as bulky as possible. Celebi also doesn’t have to invest in Special Defense; it can invest the extra EVs in Defense, such as 140 Defense EVs to survive neutral-natured Dugtrio’s Hidden Power Bug or in HP to survive as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Leech Seed + 3 Attacks Celebi is excellent alongside more offensive teammates as a token Zapdos and Water-type check. Even with Leech Seed, Celebi doesn’t have a lot of longevity and needs an aggressive pace to compensate. One of its best teammates is Skarmory, as Spikes in conjunction with Leech Seed help wear down walls such as Blissey and Snorlax, making it more likely Celebi forces them out. Another excellent teammate is mixed or Dragon Dance Tyranitar, as they both threaten common defensive cores and Water-types trying to check them give Celebi a free switch-in. In a similar vein, other common choices include Agility Metagross and offensive Swampert, as these check Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, two Pokemon that can switch-in and potentially OHKO Celebi. Agility Metagross especially appreciates Celebi wearing down Zapdos and Skarmory. Other fast, strong offensive Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, offensive Gengar, offensive Starmie, and mixed Salamence can maintain the pace needed and appreciate Celebi wearing down foes. Offensive Starmie and Gengar are particularly good partners, as they can help Celebi check offensive Suicune, which if it gets Calm Mind, powers past Celebi.</p> <p>Celebi can also fit alongside another good special check such as defensive Jirachi, offensive Snorlax, or Blissey. These Pokemon ease Celebi’s burden of switching into both Zapdos and offensive Water-types, meaning it can use Leech Seed and its coverage offensively. Two common synergetic partners with these Pokemon are Claydol and defensive Starmie, as they spin away Spikes to maintain Celebi’s longevity. As Celebi is often faster than Heracross, it can lure in and KO it before it threatens Starmie and Claydol with an OHKO with Megahorn. Especially if Celebi is paired with Jirachi, offensive RestTalk Suicune is another common teammate, as it covers Charizard and Moltres, the two special threats they do not cover. Alongside Snorlax, Celebi fits well with common mixed offensive teammates such as Tyranitar, Agility Metagross, offensive Zapdos, Charizard, and offensive Swampert.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Celebi's main purpose is to pivot into special attacks or passive Pokemon and Baton Pass Attack boosts to physically offensive teammates. Leech Seed wears down physical tanks for the Baton Pass target and helps to force switches so that Celebi can set up on something favorable. This set is most effective when Swords Dance has not been revealed, as Celebi can surprise a Roar-less Zapdos or Blissey sent in to stall out Leech Seed PP with a boost and subsequent pass to Aerodactyl or Metagross. Recover helps Celebi to function as a tank akin to utility sets.</p> <p>Attacking filler moves can also be used to hit phazers and setup sweepers that try to ruin the pass. After a boost, Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes or comes close to OHKOing Tyranitar, Shadow Ball OHKOes Taunt Gengar, and Ancient Power has good odds to 2HKO defensive Zapdos and OHKOes Moltres. Hidden Power Bug is an option over Hidden Power Fighting when only a single attacking filler move is used. It still hits Tyranitar pretty hard and can finish off weakened defensive Taunt Gengar that barely survived Tyranitar's Pursuit.</p> <p>This set has several EV options with their own tradeoffs. The listed spread survives Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Bug and Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying under sand while also outspeeding Adamant Heracross. The slower option of 252 HP / 124 Def / 96 SpD / 36 Spe can be used to still outspeed all Tyranitar. When using attacking moves, 76 Attack EVs allow Celebi to OHKO Tyranitar and Gengar after a boost; take EVs out of Special Defense if need be. Alternatively, one can also go the fast route with 252 HP / 76 Atk / 180 Spe to outspeed Moltres, neutral-natured Salamence, and neutral-natured Flygon. Taking EVs out of Attack for 252 HP / 40 Def on the prior spread can also be done to survive Jolly Salamence's Hidden Power Flying while still outspeeding and passing out of Adamant Salamence. When not using Hidden Power Fighting, which requires 30 Speed IVs, Jolly Celebi can Speed tie with Speed-invested Salamence and Flygon, though this is extremely dangerous because Choice Band variants can OHKO Celebi should they win the tie. Note, however, that being slow can be advantageous, as Celebi taking the foe's move shields the pass target from any damage or status. This is helpful when passing to Aerodactyl or Agility Metagross, for example.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Celebi requires quite a bit of support. Magneton is almost always required to stop Skarmory from switching into Celebi and walling all its physically offensive teammates. Pursuit Tyranitar is needed for Gengar if Celebi is not carrying Shadow Ball or Ancient Power; Taunt Gengar prevents Celebi from passing, and is generally a huge threat to physical sweepers due to Will-O-Wisp and Ice- and Electric-type coverage to OHKO Salamence and Gyarados. Pursuit also limits the longevity of Choice Band Salamence and Aerodactyl, which otherwise enter freely on Celebi. Ice Beam on Tyranitar also allows it to pivot in on Dragon Dance Salamence and land an OHKO. Milotic is great as a reliable physically defensive wall that can continuously pivot into Salamence, which, again, Celebi can barely touch.</p> <p>As far as recipients go, Agility Metagross is a nice sweeper that can either use Explosion to take out bulky Water-types or boost and sweep. Dragon Dance Gyarados is one of the few pass recipients that does not fold to bulky Water-types. Notably, with a Swords Dance and a Dragon Dance boost, Gyarados OHKOes Zapdos with Double-Edge and OHKOes Aerodactyl that has been chipped by Pursuit Tyranitar. Dragon Dance Salamence has better coverage and power at the cost of being weak to Ice Beam; one can consider running a Jolly nature on it to outrun Moltres, neutrally invested Zapdos, and neutrally invested mixed Salamence. Substitute + Liechi Berry Aerodactyl is a very fast cleaner that needn't risk taking attacks for a boost, unlike Dragon Dance Salamence, despite being a little weaker. Mixed Zapdos can make use of the Attack boost to break past Blissey, Celebi, and Tyranitar or pass it further to another target. Lum Berry can be helpful on it to avoid Blissey's status moves. Finally, Snorlax is a decent physically offensive special tank that, when passed a boost, can OHKO Metagross and Tyranitar, lest the eventual Baton Pass target take an Explosion or be set up upon.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Defensive Calm Mind Celebi is a late-game sweeper. Early-game, it functions like typical utility Celebi, but Calm Mind provides pressure against PP stallers like Snorlax, Blissey, Suicune, Claydol, Zapdos, and other defensive Celebi, making this set more prone to drawing in phazers like Skarmory and Roar Tyranitar or bulky offensive Pokemon like Metagross, Tyranitar, Salamence, and Moltres. Such pressure can be used to wear down or trap Celebi's checks. With only defensive Pokemon left on the field, Calm Mind + Leech Seed is adept at cleaning up the game.</p> <p>Leech Seed, apart from its variety of functions shared with its role on utility sets, also helps Celebi to plow past Blissey, Curse Snorlax, and Rest Suicune in the endgame. Psychic is the chosen STAB move over Hidden Power Grass, as this set's attack option needs to pressure threats that cannot be reliably trapped like Salamence, Zapdos, Moltres, and Flygon.</p> <p>The Defense EVs are tailored to survive Choice Band Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Bug and Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying in sand. The Speed EVs allow Celebi to outrun Endeavor Swampert. A modest amount of Special Attack investment allows Celebi to OHKO Dugtrio after a Calm Mind boost. It also allows Celebi to 2HKO Salamence and Moltres after a boost. That said, these EVs are not really needed with Spikes and should go into Special Defense otherwise. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to minimize the odds of Swampert's Ice Beam 2HKOing Celebi under sand. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 76 SpA / 96 SpD / 20 Spe with a Calm nature can be used for better robustness against special threats, especially when trying to set up repeatedly against bulky Water-types using Ice Beam. 40, 76, and 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outrun Adamant Heracross, Modest Moltres, and Timid Moltres, respectively, are also options.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most of the partners from utility Celebi sets apply, but with slight variations. Where it comes to trappers, Dugtrio features prominently, as Calm Mind forces out more passive Celebi pivots in favor of bulky physical Pokemon like Tyranitar and Metagross, and the lack of Hidden Power Grass means Tyranitar switches in almost freely. Given that Tyranitar poses a massive offensive threat, one must have a very good reason not to use Dugtrio with this Celebi set. Magneton is still a suitable partner, but a team dedicated to supporting Calm Mind Celebi would not need Magneton to remove Skarmory in its role as a physical wall, so a spinner like Claydol or occasionally Starmie can be more useful for Spikes control. Porygon2 is also a theoretical possibility, but if one uses it, it might be hard to fit all the support this Celebi appreciates in a team.</p> <p>Defensively, Milotic and Suicune are good partners for full coverage against Tyranitar and Salamence that switch in repeatedly, and Celebi's propensity to chip Zapdos also helps these bulky Water-types in return. Swampert is also a possible partner, but it compounds the team's weakness to Moltres and benefits a little less from Dugtrio's ability to trap. Flygon's Spikes and Electric-type immunities help the team defensively against both physical and special threats, especially given Celebi's tendency to attract Skarmory. Rest Zapdos forms a nice specially defensive core with this Celebi set, especially because Celebi without Hidden Power Grass is a little shakier at dealing with offensive Water-types like Starmie and Suicune.</p> <p>Calm Mind Jirachi, Celebi, and Dugtrio form a core where Celebi and Dugtrio lure in and remove bulky physical Pokemon, and countertrapping opposing Dugtrio from a revenge kill on Celebi can open the way for a Jirachi sweep.</p> <p>Finally, just to comment on additional subtleties of using Calm Mind as opposed to a more standard utility set: it's not as common to see Calm Mind Celebi used with Heracross or Curse Snorlax. These two pretty much have the same trappable checks as Celebi, and their physical presence does not need Celebi's Calm Mind to pressure passive Pokemon, so Baton Pass is preferable for those pairings.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive Mightyena sets may seem tempting thanks to its qualities as a faster tank, but it is unable to use its STAB moves off of its greater Attack stat, and its lack of powerful coverage or setup moves also cause it to struggle breaking through defensive Pokemon; Aipom, Doduo, and Meditite boast greater power than Mightyena, while Seaking, Castform, and Flaaffy have more effective STAB attacks and coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Toxic</strong>: Gloom, Koffing, and Dustox are all unbothered by Mightyena's main method of wearing foes down and can use it as an opportunity to heal. Beedrill and Tentacool aren't entirely safe from Mightyena's attacks but can use it as setup fodder by switching in on Toxic. Magnemite only fears Hidden Power Fighting and easily exploits Mightyena for setup if it lacks it. Ariados has sufficient bulk to take repeated hits from Mightyena and threaten it back with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Status Recovery</strong>: Corsola's Natural Cure lets it absorb Mightyena's Toxic for its teammates, and even Mightyena's Hidden Power Fighting fails to 4HKO Calm Mind Corsola. Corsola can also run Refresh, as can Wartortle, allowing them both to stay in and wall Mightyena. Delcatty, Flaaffy, and opposing Mightyena can use Heal Bell to invalidate Mightyena's Toxic, but the low PP of the move and Flaaffy's lacking longevity should be accounted for.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Physical Attacks</strong>: Meditite is the only relevant Fighting-type in the tier, and its frailty makes it uncomfortable switching into Mightyena directly, but it 2HKOes Mightyena with STAB Brick Break even after an Intimidate. Seaking, Volbeat, and Choice Band Anorith all threaten Mightyena with their Bug-type STAB attacks, though Mightyena can rely on Intimidate, Toxic, and Protect to wear them down before they finish it off, or it can at least scout their attacks for its teammates. Aipom can use Focus Punch to catch Mightyena switching in and punish it with significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Ponyta, Quilava, and Elekid may lack the bulk to repeatedly switch in on Mightyena, but they still threaten it with significant damage and are not as punished by Intimidate compared to physical attackers. Despite Mightyena generally checking Psychic-types, Smoochum can rely on Ice Beam to break through a chipped Mightyena.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: If unaffected by Intimidate, even physical attackers like Aipom and Doduo can outspeed and overwhelm Mightyena given its lack of immediate recovery.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mightyena lacks any form of recovery beyond Leftovers, so repeated attacks from foes like Seaking, Castform, and Ponyta can overload Mightyena. Status from Corsola, Koffing, and Porygon forces Mightyena to become passive and use Heal Bell, if it even has Heal Bell to mitigate status.</p>",

        "Stallbreaker": {
          "description": "<p>Mightyena can function exceptionally well in an offensive-defensive role by combining its defensive utility and excellent base Attack. Return trades the recoil drawback from Double-Edge in exchange for a loss in power. This significantly increases Mightyena's longevity and gives it more opportunities to use Heal Bell. Alternatively, if Mightyena chooses to use Rest over Heal Bell, Double-Edge becomes the better alternative, allowing Mightyena to focus offensively. Hidden Power Ground is the most common coverage option, allowing Mightyena to OHKO Flaaffy after a Howl. Hidden Power Fighting is an option to threaten Castform. It also enables Mightyena to threaten Lileep with a 2HKO at +2. Howl allows Mightyena to set up on and threaten passive targets like Drowzee, Dustox, Lileep, and opposing Mightyena. With one Howl boost, Mightyena can threaten a 2HKO on Corsola, Castform, and Seaking. Heal Bell is used to maintain some defensive utility by supporting its teammates and itself as it tries to set up. Rest can often be used with Double-Edge to extend Mightyena's longevity and focus more heavily on wallbreaking with Howl. Roar is an option for setup sweepers such as Anorith, Beedrill, and Tropius that can threaten to set up on a damaged Mightyena. Mightyena's Speed investment allows it to outspeed bulky Castform, while maximum Attack investment helps solidify Mightyena's offensive presence. The remainder is invested in HP.</p> <p>Mightyena fits exceptionally well with balance and offense teams due to the excellent role compression it provides. Wallbreakers vulnerable to status such as Aipom, Seaking, and Volbeat all appreciate Heal Bell support from Mightyena. In return, they can weaken physical walls like Corsola, Koffing, Lileep, and Tropius, enabling Mightyena to use Howl and Return more freely. Volbeat is worth noting, as it can threaten opposing defensive Mightyena sets, which otherwise prove to be a nuisance if Mightyena lacks Hidden Power Fighting. Wish support from Drowzee or Delcatty on more balanced teams is greatly appreciated. However, this requires Mightyena to focus more on Heal Bell usage rather than its offensive capabilities. Thus, Mightyena prefers to use Rest and Double-Edge on more balanced builds, meaning Heal Bell support from Flaaffy or Delcatty is required. Flaaffy in particular makes for a fantastic partner, as it threatens Corsola and can spread paralysis. On more offensive teams, Mightyena greatly appreciates paralysis support from Elekid, Chinchou, and Voltorb. These Electric-types can threaten the bulky Water-types that an unboosted Mightyena can otherwise struggle into, such as Seaking, Wartortle, and Corsola. Ariados can use a slow Baton Pass to enable Mightyena to make use of Intimidate and provide it with more opportunities to use Howl or Heal Bell. Moreover, it can counter and threaten Koffing with Psychic, and in return, Mightyena removes the burn from Will-O-Wisp. Mightyena can set up against Pokemon like Lileep, Delcatty, defensive Ariados, and Dustox if it lacks Whirlwind.</p>"

        "Physically Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Mightyena is an excellent defensive anchor in ADV ZU thanks to its well-rounded bulk. Intimidate enables Mightyena to dampen physical attackers such as Aipom, Rhyhorn, and physical Noctowl. Thanks to its rare Dark typing, Mightyena is a unique stopgap to Psychic-types like Abra, Drowzee, and Smoochum. Toxic is Mightyena's most reliable move to wear down foes. Protect maximizes Mightyena's recovery from Leftovers, synergizes with Toxic, and helps it scout Choice Band attackers that might try to break through it, such as Meditite. Heal Bell is uncommon and welcome utility, letting Mightyena more comfortably deal with opposing defensive Pokemon like Porygon, Tropius, and Lileep. Return is an alternative to Heal Bell to reduce Mightyena's passivity by dealing reliable damage to a metagame with few Pokemon that resist Normal; it has a chance to 2HKO most Ponyta sets, immediately disposes of Abra, and reliably 2HKOes Meditite. No other common Pokemon in the tier resist Crunch, making it very consistent as a damaging move for Mightyena. Hidden Power Fighting deals better damage to Aipom, opposing Mightyena, and Castform, and it prevents Mightyena from being totally walled by Magnemite.</p> <p>Mightyena's role as a physical stopgap is useful for balance teams, and its ability to run Heal Bell supports defensive cores including Porygon, Noctowl, and Drowzee. Balance teams can compensate for Mightyena's limited recovery with Wish users like Delcatty and Drowzee. Mightyena's Heal Bell support is appreciated by Pokemon vulnerable to status, including Seaking, Tropius, and Castform. Mightyena's defensive value against Psychic-types is much appreciated by Poison-type teammates like Gloom, Dustox, and Koffing, which can handle Meditite's Brick Break in turn. Dustox is another Poison-type that forms a solid defensive core with Mightyena thanks to it handling non-Psychic-type special attackers, while Mightyena can blunt physical attackers like Doduo in turn. Specially defensive partners like Porygon and Castform similarly form solid defensive backbones with Mightyena. Fast cleaners like Ponyta, Quilava, and Abra benefit from Mightyena wearing down foes with Toxic while they threaten Poison-types like Gloom and Koffing that would otherwise wall it. Mightyena especially benefits from partners like the aforementioned Fire-types and Meditite that can mitigate its difficult matchup against Magnemite, and Mightyena can support them with Intimidate to allow these frailer teammates to switch in or set up more comfortably. Setup sweepers like Beedrill, Tentacool, and Anorith especially benefit from Mightyena's Intimidate widening their windows to set up; their use of Substitute has excellent synergy with Mightyena's use of Toxic to further whittle away at foes, and they can set up on Poison-types like Gloom and Koffing that would give Mightyena a hard time.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>In a tier littered with viable Dark-type Pokemon such as Sableye, Murkrow, Crawdaunt, and Cacturne, Mightyena struggles to establish a niche for itself. However, its unique access to Heal Bell + Roar allows it to compress the roles of cleric and phazer for defensively oriented Spikes stacking teams; this, in tandem with Intimidate and heavy defensive investment, allows Mightyena to pivot into physical attackers such as Pupitar and Vigoroth with relative ease and Roar them out. However, Mightyena is quite passive, not only losing one-on-one against three of the strongest Pokemon in the tier, Hitmonchan, Huntail, and Flareon, but also struggling in matchups against Roselia, Mawile, and the majority of special attackers. Mightyena's lack of notable resistances and reliable recovery further hampers its effectiveness as a defensive Pokemon. Hence, Mightyena should only be considered on teams specifically designed for setting up Spikes and phazing, as otherwise Chimecho or Roselia will better serve as a cleric.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect can be used over Toxic to gain extra Leftovers recovery. Offensive sets utilizing either Choice Band or Howl can make use of the perfect neutral coverage that Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide. However, Murkrow is a better Choice Band user because of its secondary STAB type and higher Speed, while Crawdaunt and Cacturne, though slower than Mightyena, are better at wallbreaking due to their access to Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Machoke take nearly nothing from Mightyena's Crunch and can force it out with their strong STAB attacks. While Hitmonchan prefers not to be badly poisoned by Toxic as it switches in, Machoke doesn't mind whatsoever, as poison activates Guts. Poison- and Steel-types such as Roselia, Venomoth, and Mawile are immune to Toxic, take very little from Crunch, and can either set hazards or super effectively hit Mightyena in return. Strong special attackers such as Plusle, Dewgong, and Wailord can all 2HKO Mightyena. These specific Pokemon can also play around Toxic, with Plusle being able to block status with Substitute and Dewgong and Wailord being able to Rest off the poison.</p>",

Crunch prevents Mightyena from being overly passive even if uninvested, letting it nab several important KOs such as 3HKOing Huntail when combined with repeated Spikes damage. Toxic nails Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Sableye as they switch in and, in tandem with Spikes support, further drains opposing Pokemon's health.</p> <p>It's dangerous to rely on Mightyena to check multiple threats throughout the match unless you have Wish support. All of NU's viable Wish users have an unfavorable matchup against Hitmonchan, unlike Chimecho, which can sufficiently heal itself. Thus, unless phazing is an absolute necessity for your team, it's probably better to use Chimecho. Mightyena needs to be paired with a Spiker to function properly; Roselia is an optimal choice, thanks to not only having no overlapping type weaknesses, unlike Glalie and Cacturne, but also having access to reliable recovery using Synthesis. Furthermore, Roselia sports the best bulk out of all three of NU's Spikers, fitting best on the defensively oriented teams Mightyena enjoys being used on. Mightyena also needs a bulky spinblocker to keep Spikes in play and check the most prominent Rapid Spin user, Hitmonchan. Sableye is ideal for this. Possessing Fighting- and Normal-type immunities and reliable recovery, Sableye can switch into Hitmonchan time and time again fearing nothing but Toxic, which Mightyena can alleviate with Heal Bell.</p>"

To top it off, Breloom has Mach Punch to revenge kill Dragon Dance Tyranitar, limit Dugtrio's ability to revenge kill it, and generally finish off weakened foes.</p> <p>Breloom, however, is incredibly frail, and the Pokemon that it switches into frequently carry moves like Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Focus Punch that can severely damage or OHKO it. Breloom is also rather slow; while it can outspeed most defensive Pokemon, the vast majority of offensive threats can easily revenge kill it. Breloom also has poor coverage; it relies on a weak Hidden Power or status moves to cripple Pokemon that resist Fighting. This limits its utility outside of the initial Spore + Focus Punch sequence, lets Ghost-types and Psychic-types with Recover wall it, and renders it setup fodder for Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados. Finally, Breloom is easily trapped and revenge killed by healthy Dugtrio.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Bug nails Celebi and deals good damage to the spinners Starmie and Claydol, making it especially effective on Spikes teams. Hidden Power Ghost Breloom can hit Gengar super effectively if Pursuit Tyranitar is not used as a partner, and like Hidden Power Bug sets, it can chip Psychic-types. However, Hidden Power Ghost is unreliable, as it requires prediction to hit Gengar on the switch to win the interaction.</p> <p>Stun Spore cripples common Breloom switch-ins like Zapdos, Moltres, Gengar, Salamence, and Gyarados. One of the most common ways to deal with Breloom is to sacrifice a Pokemon to Spore and then go to a Fighting-resistant or immune teammate above to absorb the Focus Punch. Stun Spore really cripples these checks because they are highly valued for their Speed. Stun Spore is also useful for denying free setup opportunities to Dragon Dance Gyarados, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Calm Mind Jirachi. However, Stun Spore is quite useless against Celebi and Starmie due to Natural Cure.</p> <p>A SubSeed Breloom set can exploit the free turn that sleep generates to set up Substitute and start stalling. Besides allowing Leech Seed stall, Substitute lets Breloom scout for switches to a designated Pokemon to absorb Spore. Should the foe be slower, Substitute allows Breloom to use Focus Punch without expending Spore or continue with Spore to fire off two Focus Punches. This really punishes teams that have only one Pokemon that can take a Focus Punch. Unfortunately, this set has a hard time getting past Celebi due to its immunity to Leech Seed.</p> <p>Swords Dance combined with Mach Punch and Sky Uppercut turns Breloom into a scary late-game sweeper when all the Fighting-resistant foes have been cleared out. This set does very well against opposing offense teams that plan on revenge killing Breloom with fast but frail cleaners like Aerodactyl and Jolteon. The cost of this set is its mid-game wallbreaking power due to the lack of Focus Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Salamence and Gyarados are great checks to Breloom thanks to their typings and Intimidate. Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados can use Breloom to set up, while mixed Salamence can be particularly threatening to Breloom's teammates, especially when it gets many opportunities to enter the field. While less common, Wish + Protect Salamence and Rest Gyarados are perhaps the most robust Breloom counters. Other Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, Charizard are all frailer Fighting-resistant Pokemon but can still switch into Focus Punch once per game. Skarmory can effectively check Breloom with Drill Peck but cannot switch safely into Focus Punch.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Fighting, so it can switch safely into any Breloom, assuming it is not running Hidden Power Ghost or Stun Spore; however, Breloom is frequently partnered with Pursuit Tyranitar, so Gengar is not a reliable solution.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Celebi and Starmie with Recover are some of the best Breloom checks; however, they have to be careful of Hidden Power Bug Breloom and Pursuit Tyranitar. Claydol lacks a form of instant recovery, but with its good bulk and sand immunity, it can manage to switch into Breloom a couple of times.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio traps and OHKOes Breloom. However, Mach Punch followed by a Pursuit user will trap and eliminate Dugtrio in return.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk Heracross</strong>: Sleep Talk Heracross is a rare set, but it’s a good Breloom check; unlike any other check, it can absorb the Spore and threaten Breloom out with Guts-boosted attacks. It also takes little damage from Breloom's attacks, courtesy of its Fighting resistance.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Venusaur and Weezing are serviceable Breloom checks thanks to their Fighting resistances. However, they lack recovery moves and are not immune to sand, so they are bound to get worn out over the course of the game.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Jirachi</strong>: Wish + Protect physically defensive Jirachi is a good Breloom check despite not resisting Fighting because of its sheer bulk and sand immunity.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Aerodactyl, Calm Mind Jirachi, offensive Suicune, and offensive Starmie cannot switch reliably into Breloom, but all are faster and can threaten an OHKO as long as they are out of range of Mach Punch.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Spore": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spore is what sets Breloom apart from the other Fighting-types in OU. Sleep is a great asset against balance and defensive teams that have a dedicated role for each Pokemon, as putting one wall out of commission provides opportunities for specific teammates to wallbreak and sweep. For example, putting a Ground-, Water-, or Steel-type to sleep can help secure a Dragon Dance Tyranitar sweep. Spore is also good against hit-and-run-based offense teams that lack setup sweepers that are strong against Breloom, as these teams struggle to come back from the functional one Pokemon deficit of sleep. Spore is also useful to shut down Spikers and spinners like Skarmory,  Claydol, or Forretress.</p> <p>Focus Punch is Breloom's strongest move and synergizes perfectly with Spore, allowing it to dish out a devastating attack while the opposing Pokemon is sleeping or switching out. It is so strong that physically bulky Pokemon like Skarmory, Metagross, and Swampert are likely to be 2HKOed, common Fighting-resistant foes like offensive Zapdos and Moltres are potentially 2HKOed in sand, and even sturdier Fighting-resistant foes like Salamence cannot switch in forever. While not as powerful, Sky Uppercut is a reliable attack that threatens Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Blissey, which sometimes stay in on Breloom after a teammate has been put to sleep; Sky Uppercut is also useful to finish off slow Pokemon that Breloom or its teammates have weakened previously, like Skarmory, Swampert, and Metagross. The combined threat of Focus Punch on switching out and Sky Uppercut on staying in makes Breloom really hard to predict and appropriately check.</p> <p>Mach Punch makes Breloom the best priority user in OU. Mach Punch primarily revenge kills chipped Dragon Dance Tyranitar and low HP Aerodactyl; additionally, it puts Dugtrio that revenge kill Breloom into range of Tyranitar's Pursuit. Finally, Mach Punch gives Breloom that extra bit of damage against many faster offensive threats like Jolteon, offensive Jirachi, Salac Berry Heracross, and Salac Berry Vaporeon, helping teammates take them down, possibly with the aid of sand, even if Mach Punch itself does not KO them.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar, Swampert, Cloyster, and Vaporeon; slower variants of defensive Celebi, Jirachi, and Zapdos; and neutral nature Metagross, Claydol, and Magneton. At worst, Jolly Breloom Speed ties with Metagross, Cloyster, and Magneton. Outspeeding maximum Speed Tyranitar is especially important because it commonly runs a set with Lum Berry and Fire Blast, which allows it to switch into Spore and OHKO Breloom. However, an Adamant nature gives a 50% chance to OHKO Modest Blissey with Sky Uppercut and a chance to 2HKO Skarmory with Focus Punch + Sky Uppercut.</p> <p>There are generally two ways to use Spore. If Breloom is used on a team with a variety of sweepers and wallbreakers, it is beneficial to use Spore early-game. There is a good chance that Spore disables a check to one of Breloom's teammates, letting it make progress. If Breloom's team is focused on trading KOs with the opponent, such as a Dugtrio team or one with Choice Band Metagross and Curse + Self-Destruct Snorlax, then it is beneficial to use Spore late-game after several trades are made. This prevents opponents from sacrificing the sleeping Pokemon and increases Breloom's impact—with few Pokemon remaining, it is likely that the opponent will lack a sufficient defensive backbone to handle Spore and Focus Punch. While Spore is almost always good to use, one must be wary of getting lured into providing setup opportunities; sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Calm Mind Jirachi can easily turn the tables if Breloom slept a different foe instead, bringing their team back from behind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The single most important piece of support that Breloom appreciates is Pursuit, since Gengar walls it and bulky Psychic-types like Celebi, Starmie, and Claydol check it effectively. Pursuit Tyranitar is an excellent partner that can potentially deal with all of these Pokemon. In addition, it traps the Flying types that threaten Breloom: Tyranitar can switch into Choice Band Salamence's Hidden Power Flying, mixed Salamence’s Fire Blast, Choice Band Aerodactyl’s Double-Edge or Hidden Power Flying, Moltres’s and Charizard’s Fire Blasts, and even Zapdos’s Thunderbolt to forcibly chip each with Pursuit. If Dugtrio revenge kills Breloom, Mach Punch, followed up by Tyranitar's Pursuit, will KO it in return. Tyranitar also sets sand, which makes Breloom's Focus Punch damage stick against the sand-weak Fighting-resistant foes like Zapdos and Salamence. Despite Pursuit Tyranitar having the most synergy with Breloom, mixed and Dragon Dance Tyranitar might be better partners on hyper offense teams, as they have more offensive potential. If this choice is made, one should mitigate the Gengar weakness with Stun Spore or Hidden Power Ghost. Less popular Pursuit users like Metagross, Houndoom, and Umbreon are also potential Breloom partners, fitting well on teams without sand or those that prefer a different Tyranitar set.</p> <p>Breloom sometimes struggles to get on the field due to its poor defenses, so it is commonly paired with pure or Substitute Baton Pass users like Zapdos, Celebi, and Vaporeon. Zapdos is the most common and consistent of the three, as it synergizes nicely with Breloom defensively and offensively: Zapdos can pass to Breloom to handle a Rock Slide from Tyranitar or to pressure Blissey and Snorlax that come in on Zapdos. Celebi can pass out of Pursuit Tyranitar into Breloom or catch Skarmory on the switch to deny Spikes with Breloom's Spore. Vaporeon is another Substitute + Baton Pass user that can create Substitutes that survive Blissey's Seismic Toss to pass to Breloom safely.</p> <p>Breloom fits well on mixed offense teams. Mixed attackers lure in and weaken Skarmory, Celebi, and Zapdos for Breloom and vice versa, while Breloom compensates for their inability to break past the bulky core of Milotic and Blissey. These mixed attackers include mixed Salamence, offensive Swampert, Charizard, and mixed Zapdos. Using Charizard and Zapdos helps offensive teams check the tier's most fearsome physical threats without wasting a teamslot on a passive wall; both defensively cover Metagross, while Breloom covers physical Tyranitar. In general, offense teams need a strategy for checking Dragon Dance Tyranitar, and Mach Punch Breloom shores up that weakness without ceding momentum. Breloom is also great on offense teams that rely on trades to get into a favorable position. With partners that can take out just about any Pokemon one-on-one, like mixed or Choice Band Explosion Metagross, Self-Destruct Snorlax, and Endeavor Swampert, one can continuously trade KOs until there are few Pokemon left on either side; here, Spore, by disabling one of the key Pokemon remaining, can be devastating. Dugtrio can also perform trades via trapping and revenge killing; additionally, it can reverse trap opposing Dugtrio and enable Calm Mind sweepers, though one has to be careful about stacking weaknesses to Dragon Dance Salamence. Finally, Breloom fits very well on offense teams that feature setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Tyranitar; Calm Mind Jirachi, Suicune, and Celebi; or Substitute Aerodactyl, as sleeping a wall provides extra turns for them to set up and break through.</p> <p>On stall and balance teams, Breloom is used to generate momentum and win the Spikes war, putting either the opposing Spiker or spinner to sleep. While both Skarmory and Forretress are appropriate Spikers, Forretress is the more common Breloom partner, as they both benefit from Pursuit Tyranitar. Forretress is also good at pressuring the Psychic-types that wall Breloom like Celebi, Claydol, and Starmie with Hidden Power Bug. As both Breloom and Forretress are weak to mixed attackers, they are often paired with a mixed wall like Blissey, Milotic, or specially defensive Zapdos; these are especially useful versus mixed Salamence, which is a very common Breloom answer. Aerodactyl is another good switch-in to mixed Salamence and acts very well as a late-game cleaner when used with Spikes. Additionally, Hidden Power Bug Aerodactyl can also mitigate Breloom’s weakness to Psychic-types, especially Celebi.</p>"

  "Vigoroth": {
    "ru": {"sets": {"Bulk Up": {}}},
    "nu": {
      "overview": "<p>Vigoroth is an excellent Pokemon in the NU tier due to its decent stats, great movepool, and high number of sets to work with. It faces very little competition from other Normal-types in the tier and performs a variety of roles due to its great movepool. Vigoroth also is part of a very good Speed tier, Speed tying with Pokemon such as Golbat, Abra, Pikachu, and Venomoth while outspeeding Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Glalie. Vigoroth's Normal typing is somewhat of a hindrance, however, as it has trouble hitting Ghost-types, particularly Haunter and Sableye, and is weak to the omnipresent Hitmonchan. While Vigoroth's bulk is good, it has a low base 55 Special Defense stat. However, with the right EV investment, Vigoroth can still be an incredibly bulky and threatening Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vigoroth sports a gigantic movepool and good enough stats to run just about anything, allowing it add a niche option to any of its sets in order to surprise your opponent. Do note though that the moves provided above give Vigoroth the best overall potential when on the battlefield. Crush Claw can actually be pretty cool, as it can allow Vigoroth to potentially break through physically defensive Relicanth, allowing it to 2HKO with Earthquake once Relicanth is at -2. Bulk Up will overall be more useful as it simultaneously provides Vigoroth with Defense boosts and is not reliant on the opponent staying on the battlefield, but it can be an interesting stallbreaking tool on sets that are strapped for moveslots, as it will also fulfill the need for a STAB move. Rock Slide is an option that allows Vigoroth to hit Flying-types like Golbat super effectively while also catching Fire-types like Flareon and Torkoal in the same slot. Facade is an alternative STAB option to capitalize on the fact that Vigoroth is a common target of Toxic; however, Return and Body Slam are overall more reliable and non-dependent on being inflicted with status. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be run to help support a teammate, and Vigoroth is one of the fastest users of the moves available in the tier. Finally, Yawn can be used to force the foe to switch out or put them to sleep, although Encore and Taunt are overall more useful for stallbreaking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost-types are the most significant counter to Vigoroth, though Haunter has to watch out for Shadow Ball. Sableye in particular walls every Vigoroth set excluding ones with Taunt or Toxic. Steel-types like Metang and Mawile are difficult to break without Earthquake, but the latter needs to watch out for Reversal, Brick Break, or Focus Punch as well. Bulky Rock-types like Sudowoodo and Relicanth resist Vigoroth's Normal-type STAB moves and take surprisingly little from all super effective coverage due to their sheer bulk. Toxic renders almost every Vigoroth set useless, as many require certain HP or multiple turns to set up, thus reducing Vigoroth's overall usefulness throughout a match.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Bulk Up": {
          "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to provide a bulky setup sweeper that is difficult to break after acquiring boosts. Return is the more powerful STAB option; however, Body Slam can be used to fish for paralysis. Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types such as Mawile and Metang and Rock-types like Relicanth and Sudowoodo. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types like Haunter super effectively, but it still is not doing very much damage to Sableye. Alternatively, Substitute protects Vigoroth from status but leaves it without useful coverage. Slack Off guarantees recovery for Vigoroth, allowing it to have a good matchup versus bulky teams lacking solid checks.</p> <p>The EV spread provided helps compensate for Vigoroth's poor special bulk and allows it to manually boost its Defense with Bulk Up. Vigoroth best sets up on weaker attackers such as Roselia and Mawile when given free turns, but it needs to make sure it is able to set up multiple boosts before it attempts to take on Hitmonchan. It also should make sure any phazers are eliminated or able to be OHKOed before they can force Vigoroth out if it wants any chance of sweeping. Vigoroth is almost hard countered by Sableye, so make sure it is removed or significantly weakened before attempting to set up with Vigoroth. Ghost-types in general trouble Vigoroth, and as Haunter is immune to Earthquake due to Levitate, it is advised that all Ghost-types be dealt with beforehand. It also struggles with Rock- and Steel-types, so they should also be weakened or removed prior. However, they can struggle to break through Vigoroth in return without Toxic or Explosion. Vigoroth needs to be wary about Toxic, as it can render it almost useless, since it nearly always needs quite a few turns to set up. Vigoroth appreciates Pursuit support from Pokemon like Houndour and Murkrow to help deal with troublesome Ghost-types. Vigoroth also likes having teammates like Golbat and Chimecho that can sponge Fighting-type attacks, the latter of which can also provide some crucial Heal Bell support in the event of Vigoroth getting inflicted by Toxic.</p>"
        },
        "Flail + Reversal": {
          "description": "<p>As a more offensive approach to Vigoroth, this set aims to take advantage of the fact that it is the only Pokemon capable of running Flail and Reversal, and it uses this to great effect. Endure is used to guarantee to survive a hit that would OHKO it at 1 HP; however, it relies more on prediction than Substitute. Substitute, however, requires Vigoroth to be faster than whatever it is using it against before Salac Berry activates and can get thoroughly messed up by Spikes currently on your side of the field. Flail is a powerful STAB move that will have 200 Base Power in ideal circumstances. Reversal can be a powerful 200 Base Power Fighting-type move that hits Steel- and Rock-types that resist Flail, but it is also reliant at being low on HP. Shadow Ball allows Vigoroth to hit Haunter as well as Sableye, but it fails at doing anything to Sableye if it has any sort of HP left.</p> <p>Salac Berry raises Vigoroth's Speed when it is under a quarter of its total HP. If running Substitute, more HP investment might be useful, as Vigoroth might be able to survive some weak hits behind Substitute. However, Vigoroth's HP should always be a multiple of 4 plus 1 to allow it to get down to 1 HP. An Adamant nature can be used for more power, but Jolly can be used if Vigoroth wants to outspeed Huntail in rain after its Salac Berry activates. Vigoroth appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Ghost-types such as Steel-types, Pursuit trappers, and many specially defensive RestTalk users. Ground-types can be used to deal with Pokemon like Metang, which resists Flail and takes Reversal neutrally, though it is 2HKOed by a maximum Base Power Reversal. Rapid Spin users like Hitmonchan and Wartortle are a necessity for sets involving Substitute to work properly, and sets utilizing Endure appreciate them as well. Either Flail or Reversal can be replaced by Return or Brick Break, respectively, if you are concerned about having two moves that are reliant on Vigoroth getting down to 1 HP to be useful. However, replacing either makes Vigoroth a worse sweeper should circumstances allow Vigoroth to successfully get to 1 HP.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Choice Band is a good option for Vigoroth if it wants immediate power, resulting in Vigoroth being one of the fastest and strongest wallbreakers available in NU. Return or Double-Edge can be used, but Return is preferred for its lack of recoil damage even though it doesn't hit as hard. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types, and Shadow Ball nails Ghost-types that every Vigoroth set struggles with. Focus Punch is a more powerful option to hit Normal-resistant Pokemon on the switch but requires far more prediction than Brick Break, which on the other hand is far less destructive.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment let Vigoroth hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Vigoroth to outspeed Jolly Hitmonchan. This set relies significantly more on prediction than other Vigoroth sets, but this is to be expected when equipping a Choice Band. As usual, Vigoroth appreciates Pokemon that can remove its normal counters of Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types while also enjoying teammates that appreciate its breaking power. In particular, another Normal-type sweeper such as Raticate loves having Vigoroth as a wallbreaking partner, allowing the pair to overwhelm the opposition.</p>"
        },
        "SubPunch": {
          "description": "<p>The main boon of this set is Focus Punch, which allows Vigoroth to deal with many of its conventional checks that are not Ghost type, such as Mawile, Relicanth, and other Steel- and Rock-types. Substitute eases prediction and helps to safely utilize Focus Punch. Bulk Up is a useful boosting tool to increase Vigoroth's power and bulk. Flail has the potential to be a powerful STAB attack but often requires ideal scenarios to work properly. Shadow Ball lets Vigoroth hit pesky Ghost-types like Haunter and Shedinja. Body Slam is a more consistent option that is useful for fishing for paralysis as well as solid damage output without the needed setup or prediction with using Focus Punch.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant nature allows Vigoroth to hit as hard as possible while still outspeeding Hitmonchan. Salac Berry is the preferred item due to its ability to boost Vigoroth's Speed in a pinch, but Leftovers can be used for more longevity. Note that Leftovers should never be used in combination with Flail. Vigoroth needs Pokemon that deal with Ghost-types, as they are most likely a hard stop to Vigoroth. If using Flail, Rapid Spin support from Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Wartortle is required to ensure that the move works optimally. This set works nicely as a lure for Steel- and Rock-types to open a sweep for a partner such as Raticate and Pidgeot which will then have free range to nail the opponent with their strong Normal-type STAB attacks.</p>"
        },
        "Taunt Lead": {
          "description": "<p>Taunt is an excellent move for preventing status and entry hazards and allows Vigoroth to shut down Pokemon like Roselia, Venomoth, and Glalie. Return is a solid STAB move with consistent damage, and Earthquake hits Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types, while Encore is a very useful option that locks setup users into their setup move and generally allows more flexibility at the cost of being completely walled by Ghost-types. Toxic is another viable move for this set to help wear down foes. Slack Off can be run in the last slot in order to give Vigoroth a more useful long-term purpose in a match, enabling it to wear down many Pokemon while having recovery of its own.</p> <p>This set is optimal as a lead, having very few bad matchups against most of the common leads seen in the tier. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are required for Vigoroth to outspeed common Glalie leads. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to allow for Vigoroth to have an offensive presence as well. Vigoroth retains excellent stallbreaking potential with Taunt and Encore with this set, and they can be used to their full effect in stall matchups. Vigoroth should not riskily switch into a potential Toxic, which would completely neuter it. In case of emergency, Vigoroth does appreciate cleric support from teammates like Roselia and Chimecho. Leftovers is the preferred item for its consistent and reliable recovery.</p>"

It has a good base 100 Speed stat too, allowing it to outspeed some key threats and force them out with its strong attacks. Unfortunately, Slaking's amazing power can only be tapped into every other turn due to its ability, Truant. Thus, Slaking has to rely heavily on proper predictions to punch through teams most effectively and is forced to use a Choice Band set, seeing how it's almost always forced to switch out after firing off just a single devastating attack regardless of its effectiveness. The opportunity cost of adding Slaking to a team is also extremely large, as it allows dangerous sweepers to come in for free every other turn. Moreover, due to how important role compression and momentum is in Ubers, you're often hard pressed to fit Slaking outside of extremely specific builds, and even then it's hard to justify the team slot it occupies.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant nature provides more firepower but comes at the cost of being outsped by neutral nature Latios and Latias, which can 2HKO Slaking with ease, as well as maximum Speed base 90 Speed foes such as Kyogre, which can OHKO with Hydro Pump or even Surf, so it's generally not preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia has enough bulk to stomach any hit Slaking throws its way and either recover the damage off or set up Reflect to take the next hit better.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is capable of taking most hits from Slaking and setting up Spikes in front of it or phazing it with Whirlwind, but it must be wary of Focus Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh can take any hit not named Hyper Beam and threaten to incapacitate Slaking with Sacred Fire, but it will still take a huge chunk from any Normal-type move Slaking opts to use.</p> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute Users</strong>: Truant will trigger even if the hit doesn't make direct contact, so Protect is a very easy way to both scout Slaking's move and telegraph a switch from its side. Substitute users like SubSalac Groudon, Kyogre, and Heracross all can take advantage of the free turn to set up their Substitute and can continuously do so in front of Slaking without being bothered much.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar and Dusclops can switch in on most of Slaking's attacks and take no damage due to being immune to Normal- and Fighting-type moves, but they both don't want to come in on a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Truant, a lot of strong Pokemon can take advantage of the free turn to switch in without being scared to take a hit, namely Deoxys-A and Kyogre, which can both OHKO Slaking.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Double-Edge is extremely strong and allows Slaking to grab important OHKOs on Pokemon such as Latios, maximum HP Latias, and lead Mewtwo. It also consistently 2HKOes defensive Groudon and Kyogre, whereas Slaking avoids a 2HKO and OHKO, respectively, from these foes. Shadow Ball provides coverage against rare Rock- and Ghost-types such as Regirock and Dusclops while also dealing larger amounts of damage to the plethora of Psychic-types that Ubers is riddled with. Notably, it has a good chance to OHKO maximum HP Latias, 2HKOes defensive Lugia, and deals good damage to Metagross. Focus Punch is the strongest move Slaking has to hit Steel-types, dealing more than 50% to Skarmory and Forretress and OHKOing Snorlax. Hyper Beam blows away the opponent's dedicated walls such as defensive Latias and Ho-Oh but prevents Slaking from switching out upon landing, making this a high-risk, high-reward move that is best utilized later in the game to pave the way for your cleaners. Earthquake is an option if you don't want to rely on Focus Punch's predictive nature but still wish to hit Steel-types like Metagross, Jirachi, and Forretress. The trade-off is being hard walled by Skarmory and Forretress. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed neutral nature Latios and Latias, common leads that are often extremely valuable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton is, by and large, Slaking's best teammate and almost mandatory, being able to trap all the Steel-types that resist Slaking's Normal-type attacks and KO them or chip them to the point that they can no longer take its attacks. Slaking fits best on offensive builds due to its hit-and-run nature. It forms an excellent double-Normal core with Snorlax, with both of them sharing checks they can overwhelm with their strong STAB moves. Deoxys-A is another great partner, cleaning up teams after Slaking has sufficiently damaged its checks with Extreme Speed. It also patches up the weakness to Substitute users that Slaking enables on its Truant turns, namely Groudon, Kyogre, and Heracross. Because of how threatening opposing Deoxys-A can be to team structures utilizing Slaking as their wallbreaker, Pursuit Metagross is a way to mitigate the impact it will have against your team. Slaking's Special Defense leaves much to be desired, leaving it extremely vulnerable to an OHKO from Kyogre. Your own Kyogre, Latios, and Latias all answer it quite well without giving up any momentum. Spikes support from Forretress and Skarmory is also appreciated, chipping at Slaking's checks so that it can OHKO them.</p>"

This, combined with its great movepool, would make it an amazing Pokemon were it not for its Truant ability, which forces Slaking to idle every other turn. As such, Slaking is best suited as a Choice Band user and must employ a hit-and-run strategy: hit hard, and then immediately switch out to avoid the negative drawbacks of Truant. Slaking can put holes in the opponents team, but relies heavily on precise prediction. With the right support, Slaking is exceptional at dealing massive damage and picking off healthy and weakened Pokemon alike.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hyper Beam, Slaking's most powerful attack, has a chance to OHKO Weezing and Suicune. However, it is rather situational; Return and Double-Edge are better primary STAB attacks. Fire Blast can OHKO Forretress and Scizor, as well as 2HKO Skarmory. If using Fire Blast, though, it is recommended that you first weaken Skarmory, as it can otherwise survive the first hit and use Rest while Slaking's Truant takes effect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost- and Steel-types, such as Gengar and Skarmory, can cause problems for Slaking, as they are immune and resistant, respectively, to Slaking's Normal-type STAB moves. While Gengar can fire off status moves at an idle Slaking or the switch-in, it is a check and not a hard counter, as Slaking can OHKO it with Shadow Ball. Skarmory, on the other hand, can take advantage of free turns to set up Spikes. Residual damage from Spikes and sandstorm is a big problem for Slaking, as with Spikes on the field and sandstorm in play, Slaking will lose a portion of its health every time it switches in. Proper prediction can aggravate this weakness, as Slaking will have to switch out having done little or no damage.</p> <p>Users of Protect can stop Slaking in its tracks: Blissey and Ninjask can use Protect on Slaking's attacking turn and do whatever they please when Truant kicks in. Blissey can use Wish to support its team while Slaking is idling or whittle its HP down with Seismic Toss. Ninjask can use Protect or Substitute against non-Fury Swipes variants, set up a Swords Dance boost, and use Baton Pass on the free turns. In general, Slaking cannot beat Substitute users, as they can simply attack Slaking as it breaks the Substitute and set up another on the free turn. This applies especially to faster foes, particularly Ninjask, Gengar, and Sceptile.</p>",

In fact it comes very close to outright OHKOing Zapdos and Salamence, even factoring in the latter's Intimidate. Double-Edge is an option over Return, as it deals extra damage in exchange for recoil. While the extra power is appreciated in certain situations, such as to nab the OHKO on the aforementioned Zapdos and Salamence, the recoil can sometimes be too much of a drawback.</p> <p>Earthquake provides coverage against the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that resist Return, such as Tyranitar, Magneton, Jirachi, and Metagross; the former two are OHKOed, and the latter two are nearly so. Shadow Ball allows Slaking to OHKO Gengar, which is immune to Return and can otherwise be problematic; it is also a little stronger against Celebi. The last move is largely filler and isn't as important as the previous three. Focus Punch is the primary option for its ability to OHKO 252/0 Tyranitar, Snorlax, and opposing Slaking. Focus Punch can also do over 50% to Skarmory, which otherwise walls Slaking.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward: maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature give Slaking an incredible 690 Attack with a Choice Band, while maximum Speed makes Slaking surprisingly fast. Fury Swipes is worth consideration in the last slot to break the Substitutes of and potentially KO Pokemon such as Ninjask, Jolteon, and Sceptile. A Choice Band is the best–and only–item for Slaking, as it must usually switch out after firing off an extremely powerful attack to avoid being setup bait or giving the foe a free attack. Being forced to switch out mitigates the locking effect of Choice Band, so Slaking might as well make full use of the Attack boost.</p> <p>Skarmory can take any of Slaking's common attacks and set up Spikes, which severely hinders it. Magneton makes for an ideal partner, as its ability to trap and eliminate Skarmory lets it clear a path for Slaking.</p>"

In the same vein as the Aerodactyl + Dugtrio strategy, this Ninjask is an excellent kamikaze attacker to break Substitutes from Pokemon such as Raikou and Celebi, which lets Dugtrio finish them off afterwards.

However, with the fairly recent commonness of Spikes and Toxic on everything, even then Shedinja is risky.

Hidden Power Ground is for Metagross, Hidden Power Fighting is for Tyranitar. As Metagross is more common in ubers, that is a real option, but in standard, Tyranitar is the most common, and most obvious switch when they know you have Shedinja. Although Shedinja will die next turn, Hidden Power Fighting will do massive damage, if not deal a KO, so it's a kind of kamikaze move. Toxic is also used mostly for uber matches, so Shedinja can actually do something to guys like Groudon and Rayquaza.

This, in combination with its workable movepool, makes Loudred a niche, but decent choice for a recipient of a Baton Pass chain.

The most effective way of stopping Loudred is by breaking the Baton Pass chain. Moves like Taunt and Encore, and powerful setup sweepers or breakers can shut down a Baton Pass chain so that Loudred cannot have an opportunity to win. Common users of these moves include Glalie, Vigoroth, Abra, and Pikachu, as well as some viable others that can end the Baton Pass strategy with ease. Hitmonchan's Mach Punch will do a monstrous amount of damage to Loudred because of its low defensive prowess, as a Choice Band-boosted one can OHKO Loudred if it doesn't have Defense boosts passed to it.</p>",

Earthquake hits Steel-types and Rock-types like Metang, Relicanth, and Sudowoodo. Fire Blast is a powerful attack that hits certain Pokemon harder than Loudred's other moves, such as Mawile and Tangela. Flamethrower is an alternative option that doesn't miss, although it does less damage. Substitute can be used to protect Loudred from status and ease prediction, as well as being able to possibly take hits if Loudred has been passed defensive boosts. It can also protect Loudred from Hitmonchan's Mach Punch if set up before it comes in.</p> <p>252 Attack EVs along with a positive nature make sure that Loudred can hit its foes as hard as possible. 140 EVs are placed into Speed so that Loudred can outspeed uninvested base 65s like Chimecho without a Speed boost, as well as the entire metagame at +2. 16 EVs are placed into Special Attack to ensure that Loudred OHKOes Tangela with Fire Blast and avoids being put to sleep, and the rest of the EVs are placed into HP to marginally increase Loudred's bulk. Leftovers is the item of choice, allowing Loudred to passively recover damage racked up from chip and opposing attacks, especially if running Substitute. Soundproof is the whole point of using Loudred, as its immunity to Roar makes it usable as a recipient of a Baton Pass chain.

Secondly, it can remove Leftovers from the likes of Skarmory, Suicune, and Blissey with Knock Off, which makes them much easier to kill. Finally, its Attack stat is high enough that even without boosting, it can 2HKO Skarmory with STAB Focus Punch.</p>",

Salamence and Gyarados are obviously good bets as they resist Cross Chop and have Intimidate to cut the damage even more. However, they might lose their item, get hit with Rock Slide, or even eat a Cross Chop critical hit; they need to watch out for Counter too. Weezing is an good bet, but it cannot beat the Sleep Talk set, Will-O-Wisp might trigger Guts, and if Hariyama Counters Sludge Bomb, Weezing is dead. Skarmory's Flying moves will hurt Hariyama, and again they might get Countered. Additionally, Skarmory is not the best bet as its lack of a Fighting resistance means it takes huge damage from Focus Punch or Cross Chop.

Furthermore, keep in mind Cross Chop's high critical hit rate, which means that even a +6 Curse Snorlax is not safe.</p> <p>This set is significantly more effective with a few layers of Spikes on the field to take advantage of Whirlwind. It also counters Baton Pass teams effectively, thanks to Cross Chop's high critical hit rate, which scares all but Ninjask, Mr. Mime, and Celebi. For instance, it dents Umbreon, Smeargle, and Vaporeon, and to an extent even Scizor. Moreover, Soundproof does not block Whirlwind, so the only way to set up is if Smeargle can use Ingrain. It is worth noting that for the matchup between Smeargle and Hariyama, the latter has Sleep Talk for Spore and Cross Chop for Ingrain. If you predict Spore, you have two chances to use Cross Chop; once on the Spore, and once on the Ingrain.

Counter is generally preferred, as Revenge still does very little to Pokemon such as Salamence, whereas Counter will OHKO. However, Revenge's advantage is that it works on both physical and special attacks. Hidden Power Ghost and Rock Slide hit most Pokemon that resist Fighting for super effective damage.</p> <p>Once again, defensive investment is preferred to HP investment due to Hariyama's naturally high HP stat, 28 Speed EVs are used to outrun Swampert, and the rest of the EVs are put into Attack.</p>"}

Nosepass does great at supporting slower teammates by crippling checks like Lileep, Koffing, and Bayleef with Thunder Wave.

Nosepass desperately needs support against Flying-types like Pidgeotto and Tailow, since it cannot damage them barring Explosion, although they hate to stay in and take a Thunder Wave. Delibird is worth mentioning because it can safely use Subsitute in front of Nosepass, so Pokemon like Castform and Delcatty are great to help circumvent this issue. Slower setup sweepers and wallbreakers like Cubone, Nidorino, and Spoink appreciate Nosepass crippling faster Pokemon like Chinchou and Delibird with Thunder Wave.

Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock is Nosepass's most reliable STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Pidgeot and Murkrow super effectively.

Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature allow Nosepass to outspeed uninvested base 60s while also outspeeding most standard 128 Speed Mawile and defensive Pokemon such as Roselia and Chimecho that it can use Explosion on. Maximum Special Attack EVs ensure that Nosepass 2HKOes Mawile with Fire Punch. Leftovers and the remaining 4 Defense EVs allow Nosepass to more adequately take two Hidden Power Steels from Mawile. Poison-types such as Arbok appreciate Mawile being removed, as they can spam STAB Sludge Bomb more freely, making them good teammates for Nosepass. Nosepass and Poison-types share a weakness to Ground, so Pokemon that have the Flying typing such as Pidgeot can provide the necessary Ground-type immunity while also resisting Grass for Nosepass. Chimecho is another great example, utilizing Levitate to provide a switch-in for Ground-types and adding a Psychic-type resistance for Arbok. Be sure to not reveal Nosepass too early; if Nosepass is revealed too early, Mawile will keep double switching out every time it is brought in, and Nosepass will lose all momentum in the process. While its defense stats might suggest otherwise, Nosepass is exceedingly frail and must be played carefully. Mawile can very easily 2HKO Nosepass with two Hidden Power Steels. Once trapped, Nosepass needs to predict correctly whether Mawile is going to attack, Taunt, or Baton Pass. Hopefully, by the time you bring Nosepass into Mawile, you will know what set it is running so that you can more easily predict around it.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sableye can make use of Taunt and Speed investment to better deal with Pokemon like defensive Relicanth, Mawile, Roselia, and Whiscash, although the move can be hard to fit over Sableye's other options. Protect helps Sableye immensely in scouting for potential lure sets like Toxic Hitmonchan as well as strong Choice Band users like Murkrow, Relicanth, and Hitmonchan. However, it is extremely difficult to fit on sets and thus sees limited use. Fire Punch can be run on Sableye's Calm Mind set over Rest to target Metang as well as Dark-resistant Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Cacturne, and Mawile. It also allows Sableye to deal substantial extra damage to Roselia, Tropius, and Bellossom. However, Sableye is already extremely vulnerable to Toxic, and dropping Rest means this set is no longer an exception to that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Even if Sableye has Special Defense investment, it is still capable of being overwhelmed by certain special attackers like Flareon, Pikachu, Octillery, and Wailord. With Spikes support, weaker attackers like offensive Dewgong and Crawdaunt can also break past Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: If inflicted with poison by a Pokemon like Hitmonchan or Chimecho, Sableye struggles to consistently check Pokemon such as Raticate and Pidgeot. Spikes pose similar problems, forcing Sableye to use Recover more often and give up momentum to the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Certain Setup Sweepers</strong>: Taunt Vigoroth doesn't have to fear being badly poisoned by Sableye's Toxic and completely shuts down Calm Mind variants, whereas Pupitar's Shed Skin helps against it as well. Bellossom can put Sableye to sleep and 2HKO it with Solar Beam, while Huntail can easily OHKO Sableye under rain with Hydro Pump.</p>",

Recover lets Sableye stay healthy so it can continuously check wallbreakers like Hitmonchan, Haunter, and Choice Band Golbat. Toxic cripples walls like Kecleon and Torkoal. Seismic Toss is Sableye's best form of immediate damage against Pokemon like Metang, Torkoal, and Mawile. Knock Off is a nice option for removing items from potential switch-ins such as Roselia and Whiscash, although it can be hard to justify over Sableye's other moves. Maximum HP investment alongside 200 Special Defense EVs lets Sableye take two Thunderbolts from Haunter after three layers of Spikes and Leftovers recovery and helps it better check Pokemon like Chimecho and Abra. The remaining EVs alongside a Bold nature contribute to Sableye's ability to check Hitmonchan and other physical wallbreakers such as Pidgeot and Raticate.</p> <p>Sableye is an incredibly linear Pokemon; it can switch into and force out a myriad of attackers such as Haunter, Hitmonchan, and Chimecho and use this opportunity to recover health or cripple the incoming Pokemon with Toxic. The important thing to keep in mind when using Sableye is that Pokemon it checks can run certain sets and moves to bypass or cripple it. For example, Choice Band Hitmonchan can overwhelm Sableye with its incredibly strong attacks, while Thief Haunter can steal Sableye's Leftovers, making it easier to wear down over time, especially with Spikes support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sableye is a great pick on many types of builds; from balanced to stall, it's usually easy to justify Sableye's inclusion. While Sableye is rather self-sufficient, it appreciates cleric support from Pokemon such as Roselia, Chimecho, and Lickitung, which helps it against Pokemon like Toxic Hitmonchan and Chimecho. Roselia and Lickitung are also beneficial for their ability to check strong special attackers like Wailord, Bellossom, and Pikachu, which can break past Sableye despite its Special Defense investment, while Chimecho can alleviate some pressure off of Sableye due to the two of them checking similar threats. In return, Sableye can check physical wallbreakers such as Pidgeot and Hitmonchan for Roselia and Lickitung. Sableye also benefits from Rapid Spin support from Hitmonchan so it can pivot into threats more easily. In return, Sableye checks Pokemon Hitmonchan struggles with, such as Chimecho and Abra.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Shadow Ball threatens Chimecho, prevents Haunter from safely pivoting into Sableye, and is Sableye's best way of pressuring Roselia. Recover helps Sableye stay healthy against strong attackers and can be useful to scout Choice Band users like Hitmonchan and Metang. Toxic cripples walls like Kecleon and Dewgong. Seismic Toss is Sableye's best form of immediate damage against Pokemon like Metang, Torkoal, and Mawile. Knock Off is a nice option for removing items from potential switch-ins such as Roselia and Whiscash, although it can be hard to justify over Sableye's other moves. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature lets Sableye check physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Pidgeot, and Arbok as well as possible.</p> <p>As opposed to trying to blanket check most of the tier, this set lets Sableye capitalize on its typing and bulk to switch into essentially any physical attacker with impunity and recover any lost health, cripple an incoming Pokemon with Toxic, or simply fire off an attack. Something to keep in mind, however, is that certain physical attackers such as Hitmonchan, Golbat, and Metang may carry Toxic, and being poisoned hampers Sableye's reliability greatly; try to scout for Toxic to prevent this. Additionally, Sableye is rather passive, meaning special attackers like Flareon and Wailord can switch in rather easily and immediately threaten it with heavy damage; prevent this by pivoting out to a teammate that can deal with them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sableye's rather flexible in the types of builds it can fit on, but it does require some support to function to its fullest potential. In particular, due to special attackers like Haunter, Flareon, and Pikachu posing massive threats to Sableye, it appreciates special walls like Cacturne, Dewgong, and Lickitung to fall back on. Additionally, Lickitung can provide cleric support, while Cacturne's Spikes help to limit the number of times opposing attackers can switch in to threaten Sableye. In return, Sableye is a reliable stop to physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Murkrow, and Relicanth. Other clerics like Roselia and Chimecho also pair well with Sableye and can check certain special attackers. Hitmonchan fits well alongside Sableye, providing Rapid Spin support so Sableye isn't as easily overwhelmed by stronger physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Hitmonchan and Choice Band Metang.</p>"

        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Calm Mind turns Sableye into a potent sweeper and helps it against special attackers like Haunter and Plusle. Hidden Power Dark is Sableye's best STAB attack, threatening Pokemon like Chimecho and Haunter while being its best form of damage against bulky Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong. Rest prevents Pokemon like bulky Hitmonchan and Metang from crippling Sableye with Toxic as it sets up. Recover keeps Sableye healthy and lets it repeatedly pivot into physical attackers like Hitmonchan, Metang, and Murkrow. Alternatively, Sleep Talk can let Sableye continue boosting and attacking while asleep, which helps reduce its passivity. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature makes Sableye as physically bulky as possible, letting it pivot into threats like Hitmonchan, Raticate, and Relicanth easily.</p> <p>Although this set is best used as a setup sweeper, Sableye's great defensive utility alongside Recover also permits it to switch into and check physical attackers such as Hitmonchan, Golbat, and Tropius. From there, Sableye can simply recover any lost health or, if it has a good chance to sweep, set up with Calm Mind. There are a couple things to keep in mind, however, when deciding to set up. If the opponent still has a potential phazer like Wailord or Flareon, setting up is probably not worth it, as these Pokemon can easily take a boosted hit and force Sableye out. It's also very difficult to justify setting up if the opponent has a Dewgong or Cacturne, which can potentially lock Sableye into Calm Mind with Encore and stall it out with Toxic in the former's case.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally, this Sableye variant fits best on stall builds, since the support it requires can come at the cost of significant offensive momentum. It's imperative to pair Sableye with a cleric like Lickitung, Chimecho, or Roselia so it can be woken up if forced to use Rest or healed of any other status condition. Lickitung also provides Wish support for Sableye, which helps lessen the need to use Recover, and is a sturdy special wall capable of checking Pokemon like Haunter, Wailord, and Pikachu, while Chimecho can help alleviate pressure from Sableye by pivoting into physical attackers like Hitmonchan. Roselia can also provide Spikes support, which helps weaken Dark-resistant Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Mawile, and Cacturne. In return, Sableye checks physical attackers for Lickitung and Roselia.</p>"

Iron Tail 2HKOes Lileep outright and hits other Rock-types like Rhyhorn and Nosepass significantly harder, though its terrible accuracy makes it unreliable. Toxic can cripple some walls, notably Grass-types like Lileep and Bayleef. Body Slam is alternative over Double-Edge, trading power for a chance to paralyze foes. Choice Band is an option to let Aron act as a wallbreaker, notably allowing it to OHKO Staryu with Double-Edge, 2HKO Staryu and Seaking with Body Slam, and 2HKO Lileep with Hidden Power Steel. Unlike other Choice Band users like Aipom and Taillow, Aron's good defensive profile allows it to easily find entry points against common foes like the aforementioned Pokemon themselves as well as foes like Dustox. However, Choice Band Aron struggles since it has no recovery without Leftovers, and Aron's power alone isn't enough to break through most defensive teams.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Rhyhorn and Cubone don't mind Aron's attacks that much and OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB moves; Cubone and offensive Rhyhorn also outspeed most Aron variants. Many Pokemon that use Hidden Power Ground, like Delibird and Taillow, can also outspeed and OHKO Aron, though these Pokemon tend to struggle to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Mankey outspeeds and OHKOes Aron with Cross Chop, and some physical attackers like Delibird, Shuppet, and Aipom carry Fighting-type coverage, with a few of them such as Choice Band Aipom and Delibird also being able to OHKO Aron. However, none of these Pokemon can switch in easily.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Koffing takes minimal damage from all of Aron's attacks, is immune to Toxic, and can burn Aron and whittle it down with special coverage, making it Aron's hardest defensive answer. Some physical walls like Bayleef can eternally wall Aron, though they must be wary of Toxic, and Lileep must be wary of Steel-type moves as well.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Chinchou and Growlithe can outspeed and OHKO Aron, though they don't enjoy switching into it. Staryu deserves a special mention, as alongside outspeeding and OHKOing Aron, Staryu will never be OHKOed by non-Choice Band Aron's attacks, only taking upwards of 90% from Double-Edge, and it can use Recover to stay healthy.</p>",

Protect lets it stall for Leftovers recovery and scout which move Choice Band users like Aipom and Pidgeotto lock themselves into. Double-Edge is Aron's strongest attack against neutral targets, dealing sizable damage to offensive foes like Aipom and Pokemon like Staryu and Seaking. Rock Slide primarily targets Flying-types like Pidgeotto and Taillow and Bug-types like Dustox and Butterfree. Earthquake mainly hits Rock-types like Rhyhorn and Nosepass, Electric-types like Elekid and Magnemite, and some Poison-types like Grimer. This EV spread maximizes Aron's Attack while giving it enough Speed investment to outspeed and revenge kill lure Rhyhorn, with the rest being dumped into HP. An EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Attack / 216 Spe can be used instead to outspeed all variants of Rhyhorn, though the loss in bulk is noticeable.</p> <p>Aron fits on balance teams that appreciate its unique defensive utility, taking advantage of other balance and some defensive teams. It stonewalls CurseTalk Grimer thanks to its immunity to Poison, making it a natural partner for teammates Grimer can otherwise take advantage of, like Delcatty and Elekid. Another notable Poison-type Aron does extremely well against is Dustox, making it pair nicely with special attackers that struggle against it like Elekid and Chinchou. It is also an excellent check to Choice Band Double-Edge users like Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow, as it can switch into most of their attacks with ease, though it must be wary of their Fighting- and Ground-type coverage. Aron also must be wary of Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Cubone, as well as Mankey, as they can easily OHKO it using their 4x super effective STAB attacks. Certain physical walls such as Bayleef and Koffing make good partners for their ability to switch into the Normal-types' coverage and check Ground- and Fighting-types. Most special attackers such as Chinchou and Growlithe have little trouble taking out Aron, so special walls and tanks like Delcatty and Castform are essential teammates. Aron struggles to break through Lileep and Koffing, so it appreciates wallbreakers like Substitute Delibird and mixed wallbreaker Seaking that work excellently in eliminating these foes. Chinchou deserves a special mention, as it can break through most physical walls, switch into and beat Water-types trying to eliminate Aron, and mitigate Aron's Speed issues using Thunder Wave.</p>"

A great Defense stat backed by a decent typing allows Lairon to almost completely wall a few Choice Band users, particularly Normal- and Flying-types like Raticate, Pidgeot, and Murkrow. However, Lairon comes with awful, terrible, horrible 4x weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, which are found on virtually all Choice Band users' sets, diminishing its overall effectiveness as a physical wall, which is compounded by its rather low Special Defense stat. Ultimately, Lairon is a subpar choice in the metagame but a neat Pokemon to use regardless if you want a super solid switch-in to Normal-, Flying-, Ghost-, and Rock-type attacks.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lairon has a pretty shallow movepool outside of the recommended sets above. Body Slam is a neat alternative that can help spread paralysis to allow a slow teammate like Octillery to sweep late-game. Endeavor is available but is hard to use and doesn't accomplish much for Lairon in the long run. Finally, Rock Tomb is an OK move when used with some Speed investment to allow Lairon or another teammate to get the jump on the foe. However, Lairon has trouble making use of it itself due to its low Speed and lack of very strong STAB attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmonchan is the best check and counter to Lairon, as it really only fears a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge and can threaten Lairon with a quick OHKO with either Sky Uppercut or Earthquake in return. From there, really any Fighting- or Ground-type attack will remove Lairon from of the game, even weak, non-STAB Hidden Powers. Water-types, particularly Relicanth, Huntail, and Whiscash, have an easy time of switching in and disposing of Lairon. Tangela can easily switch in, tank anything Lairon can throw at it, and remove it with its strong STAB Grass-type moves. Mawile almost completely walls all that Lairon can throw at it, even being immune to Toxic, and can threaten it in return with Focus Punch. Piloswine doesn't get in as safely as other checks but easily annihilates Lairon with Earthquake. Finally, while Diglett can't switch in easily, it can trap and cleanly OHKO Lairon with its own Earthquake.</p>",

Therefore, its Special Defense is invested to make use of the resistances it has, allowing it to check certain special attackers like Haunter, Chimecho, and Venomoth effectively. Hidden Power Rock or Hidden Power Steel is used as a STAB move depending on which Pokemon you'd like to target; Hidden Power Rock gets better super effective coverage, while Hidden Power Steel hits Hitmonchan and Ground-types neutrally, the latter of which are common switch-ins to Lairon.</p> <p>Toxic is the best way Lairon can spread damage around on the opponent's team considering Poison-types are unlikely to switch into it. Roar phazes the foe, prevents setup, exposes more Pokemon to Toxic damage, and racks up Spikes damage. Protect can be used in the last slot to further build up Toxic damage, scout for Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, and get some Leftovers recovery. However, Earthquake is a nice safety move to have that generally prevents Lairon from getting walled by a few Pokemon its STAB coverage misses out on, namely Water-types if using Hidden Power Steel and Ground-types if using Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p>A physically defensive EV spread can be run, as it decreases the damage from Hidden Power Ground from the likes of Choice Band Murkrow and Pidgeot pretty substantially, but it won't prevent Hidden Power or any Ground- or Fighting-type attack from 2HKOing Lairon, which is why the specially defensive EV spread is recommended. RestTalk can be used to greatly increase Lairon's longevity; however, due to Lairon's susceptibility to being easily OHKOed by common moves and the great utility of both Roar and Protect, it's hard to justify using it over the presented set. Both Rock Slide and Hidden Power Steel can be used on this set to give Lairon a bit more coverage, but it's largely unneeded and Protect is still an overall better choice considering the large number of Choice Band users in the tier.</p> <p>A switch-in to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks is needed for this set to be effective, making Pelipper, Tangela, and Chimecho valued teammates. Lairon can check a myriad of special attackers, but it's super weak to Water-type attacks and some special attackers can still break through, making special walls like Kecleon, Lickitung, and Bellossom great teammates. Spikes support is pretty crucial to this set's success, making Glalie, Cacturne, or particularly Roselia a needed teammate.</p>"

Lairon also still completely walls the physical attackers it needs to. Hidden Power Rock and Iron Tail are the recommended STAB moves due to the former's reliability and the latter's sheer power. However, if you're uncomfortable using Iron Tail due to its accuracy, Rock Slide can be used over Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Steel can be used over Iron Tail. Earthquake and Double-Edge complete the set's coverage, with Double-Edge chosen in the last slot over Return thanks to the lack of recoil due to Rock Head.</p> <p>Some Speed EVs can be run to let Lairon outpace minimum Speed base 50s; however, Lairon needs all the bulk it can get in order to tank special attacks like Chimecho's Psychic. A switch-in to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks is needed for this set to be effective, making Pelipper, defensive Tangela, and Whiscash valued teammates. Lairon is extremely weak to most special attackers with this set even with its many resistances. Kecleon, Dewgong, and Lickitung are good specially defensive teammates that can take on a large portion of the special attackers in the tier, though they stack a major weakness to Hitmonchan with Lairon. Swalot is another option to switch into special attackers, and it can also take on the likes of Hitmonchan very well, though it too stacks a weakness to Ground-type attacks.

Double-Edge is stronger than Return and 2HKOes Koffing, but the recoil damage is not preferred on a Pokemon as frail as Meditite when Return is strong enough for it to break other Pokemon that resist Fighting. A set with Substitute, Leftovers, and Focus Punch can take advantage of the switches Meditite forces, but the surprise factor goes away once the set is revealed, and Meditite is better at dealing immediate damage. A Salac Berry set with Substitute or Endure and Reversal can turn Meditite into a sweeper, but it struggles to set up safely and is vulnerable to being picked off by Quick Attack from offensive Pokemon like Doduo, Ponyta, and Quilava. Fake Out is tempting to compensate for Meditite's middling Speed, but it is very exploitable once it's locked into Fake Out. Baton Pass might seem interesting to help Meditite pivot out of bad matchups, but its role is to deal as much damage as possible instead of trying to position its partners.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Fighting</strong>: Meditite cannot 2HKO Koffing with any of its coverage moves and risks burns from Will-O-Wisp, and Koffing can use Pain Split to keep itself healthy enough to check Meditite. Gloom and Tropius are difficult for Meditite to break through without proper prediction or chip damage, though they are 2HKOed by Hidden Power Flying. Volbeat and Beedrill have to be wary of Meditite's coverage but can take a Choice Band-boosted Brick Break. Drowzee fears Shadow Ball and Return, but physically defensive sets can beat Meditite one-on-one if it's locked into Brick Break or Hidden Power Flying.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Quilava, Abra, and Ponyta all outspeed and OHKO Meditite. Aipom and Doduo can even take advantage of Meditite locked into Shadow Ball. However, almost no faster Pokemon can safely switch into Choice Band Meditite's Brick Break or even Return, so they must be careful.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Porygon and Castform's Thunder Wave debilitates Meditite due to its frailty and role as a mid-Speed wallbreaker, making them unsafe to switch into. Body Slam from Delcatty deals significant damage and can punish Meditite with paralysis for trying to switch in to take advantage of it using a non-attacking move.</p> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect users like Mightyena, Seaking, and Castform can scout Meditite's move and switch to an appropriate teammate, which is very frustrating from otherwise easy targets for Meditite.</p>",

Baton Pass support from users like Delcatty and Volbeat is appreciated to help Meditite get in more safely. Paralysis support from Castform, Flaaffy, and Porygon can slow down faster offensive Pokemon for Meditite to beat, and Meditite's power compensates for its more utility-oriented teammates.

A lot of these only counter the Choice Band variant with proper prediction, however, as none of them can take a super effective hit after switching in, except maybe Salamence and Slowbro. Crobat packs a 4x resistance to Fighting and can OHKO Medicham with Choice Band-boosted Aerial Ace, but is OHKOed in turn by Rock Slide and takes a load of damage from Shadow Ball, and even Focus Punch hurts thanks to Medicham's 720 Attack. All in all, resistances are the best way to deal with Medicham.</p> <p>Bear in mind that, unlike Heracross, Medicham is not OHKOed by Jolly Dugtrio if it has at least 20 HP EVs, while Adamant Dugtrio can't guarantee the OHKO on even uninvested Medicham.</p>",

These options should mostly replace Crunch, because it's not going to be hitting Grumpig and the like much harder than Thunderbolt, anyway.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>The EVs mentioned with the moveset allow you to get 330 Speed, which is a nice Speed to be at in UU considering that there are a lot of Pokemon in the 328-9 region. Instead of maxing Special Attack, by taking 8 EVs from it and moving it into the leftover EVs you got from setting the Speed below its maximum, you achieve a HP that is divisible by four which is very nice to activate your Petaya after 3 Substitutes instead of 4, so you might survive some random Quick Attacks, but being able to Substitute 4 times can also be useful.</p> <p>The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Water should use 30 Attack, 30 Defense, and 30 Special Attack, with 31 everywhere else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn can often eat a few Hidden Power Grasses and deal Surfs in return. Meganium takes around 2 Hidden Power Ices, and with Light Screen, even more. Quagsire can counter it only if Manectric's Hidden Power isn't Grass.

The choice of Hidden Power can be a tad tough though. Hidden Power Grass is so you don't get totally walled by Lanturn and Quagsire, and so you can use it on Golem.

Unfortunately, Roselia has a rather poor defensive typing that leaves it vulnerable to several common attackers, including Flareon, Chimecho, and Golbat.

Leech Seed can cripple Baton Pass chains and provides Roselia with extra healing, potentially letting it set another layer of Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hitmonchan</strong>: Hitmonchan's combination of power and special bulk lets it easily switch into Roselia and threaten it with heavy damage, giving it an opportunity to remove Spikes with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Haunter, Golbat, and Arbok don't appreciate being paralyzed, but they resist Grass and can also switch in on predicted uses of Spikes to force Roselia out.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Chimecho poses a great threat to Roselia, since it can remove paralysis with Heal Bell and set up in Roselia's face with Calm Mind.

Synthesis keeps Roselia healthy, letting it continue setting Spikes and checking Pokemon like Huntail and Plusle. Giga Drain helps Roselia immensely against offensive Wailord and Huntail, healing it for a great amount and letting it take multiple Ice Beams, although Hidden Power Grass works on and against bulkier teams due to its greater PP. Stun Spore dissuades Flying-types like Pidgeot and Murkrow as well as Haunter from switching into Roselia while it sets Spikes. Alternatively, Aromatherapy turns Roselia into a cleric and lets it support other bulky teammates by healing them of poison. Hidden Power Fire targets Steel- and Grass-types like Metang, Mawile, Bellossom, and Tropius as well as Glalie. 20 Defense EVs prevent Choice Band Pidgeot's Aerial Ace from OHKOing Roselia, while the remaining EVs go into special bulk to improve its matchup against foes like Wailord and Pikachu.</p> <p>It's ideal to set Spikes as early as possible; although Roselia will have multiple opportunities to each game thanks to Synthesis keeping it healthy, the chip damage from Spikes helps create and press advantages greatly. Due to Roselia's average bulk, it must be careful of coverage moves like Wailord's Ice Beam; be sure to monitor Roselia's health carefully so that it isn't put in range of a 2HKO from such attacks. Several Pokemon that can take advantage of Roselia detest being paralyzed; using Stun Spore on a predicted switch is generally a low-drawback play, so long as setting Spikes isn't necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Hitmonchan are mandatory to pair alongside Roselia, as it's unable to prevent Hitmonchan from switching into it and removing its Spikes with Rapid Spin. Sableye and Chimecho are great partners for this reason, and they also check other Pokemon that threaten Roselia such as Haunter, Golbat, and Chimecho. In return, Roselia checks certain offensive Water-types like Wailord, Huntail, and Seadra. Wallbreakers and late-game sweepers like Metang, Haunter, and Wailord greatly benefit from Roselia's Spikes; furthermore, Metang and Wailord enjoy Stun Spore support, since they're rather slow. Backup checks to special attackers, like Lickitung and Dewgong, are helpful, since Roselia's bulk can lead to it folding to strong, super effective coverage moves.</p>"

Unfortunately, that also means that Swalot's viability in the tier is almost invalidated, despite it sporting way better base stats and a much more colorful movepool. Even though Swalot's somewhat outclassed, its resistance to Fighting and relatively few weaknesses across the board make it a decent choice for balanced defensive teams. By being a great check to Hitmonchan, disrupting stall tactics by the likes of Sableye and Roselia, and packing an atom bomb in Explosion, Swalot performs amicably in the tier and has a place on balanced teams that need to condense roles into a couple of Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Luckily for Swalot, its usable movepool is actually quite expansive. A specially attacking tank set is definitely viable, as Swalot has a decent base 73 Special Attack and a very nice special movepool with Ice Beam, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Hidden Power Grass; the surprise moves Counter and Explosion can still make an appearance here too. A Choice Band set can also be done, as a Choice Band-boosted Explosion is absolutely ridiculous, and STAB Sludge Bomb is going to leave a huge mark in targets like Chimecho.</p> <p>As for individual moves, Pain Split is Swalot's best chance at reliable recovery outside of Rest, but it's pretty hard to use considering Swalot's massive HP stat. Swalot gets both Sunny Day and Rain Dance; it can use either to good effect and get a weather sweeper in for free with Explosion. Sing can be used to put a target to sleep, but its accuracy sucks and Yawn is about as effective overall. A combination of Acid Armor and Amnesia can make Swalot nigh-impenetrable save for a critical hit, but they do nothing to prevent the opponent from setting up on Swalot as usual.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best general switch-ins to Swalot are Chimecho and Haunter, the latter being probably better since it is immune to Explosion and 4x resists Sludge Bomb. Sableye is another great switch-in for the same reasons and can set up Calm Mind in front of Swalot, though it will need to watch out for Toxic. Otherwise, Steel-types like Mawile and Metang are probably the safest switch-ins to Swalot, as they resist Ice Beam and Explosion and are immune to Toxic. In general, anything with Earthquake like Piloswine, Graveler, Relicanth, or Whiscash will be effective against Swalot, though they must be prepared for Counter. In the same vein, Diglett can trap and nail Swalot with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake, coming close to OHKOing the specially defensive set, but it will be only doing 68% at most to the physically defensive set. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Pupitar and Bulk Up Vigoroth definitely give Swalot some problems as well. Finally, immediately strong special or physical attackers like Rain Dance Huntail, Choice Band Kingler, and Abra will be able to plow through Swalot without many issues.</p>",

It's also one of the few Pokemon that's not 2HKOed by Rain Dance Huntail, assuming it is running Surf over Hydro Pump; even if things go south, Swalot can Explode on it as well. Physical attacks like Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground are preferred with a specially defensive spread as most special attackers tend to have a lower Defense stat, which is particularly true of most of the Grass-types save for Tangela.</p> <p>Encore can be used over Hidden Power Ground to lock the foe into a useless move like Toxic to force switches. Toxic is the best option in the third slot to allow Swalot to spread damage around defensive teams, though it may be a bit redundant with the poison chance from Sludge Bomb. Yawn can be used to force switches and works super well with Spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Shadow Ball is another good option for the third slot to complete Swalot's neutral coverage with Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground, destroy Haunter, and land a good hit on Chimecho without having to resort to Explosion. The last slot goes to Explosion, which gives Swalot a nearly guaranteed way to take out the foe and ensures the opponent can't use Swalot as setup bait.</p> <p>Specially defensive Swalot is one of, if not the, best counters to Grass-types in the tier, due largely to its massive bulk, resistance to both Grass and Poison, and Liquid Ooze ability, the latter of which punishes the use of Leech Seed. Maximum Special Defense is the preferred EV spread to allow Swalot the best possible chance of tanking an attack from Huntail and being able to retaliate in some manner.</p> <p>Special attacks like Ice Beam and Thunder Punch can be used over Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground, and doing so comes with the benefit of being able to hit Tangela, Huntail, and Seadra super effectively while targeting their weaker defensive stat, but the stronger hits on most other special attackers are more desired. Chimecho and Haunter are probably the safest switches into Swalot, though the former needs to be really careful of Explosion and Swalot's specially defensive set may just be luring it in for that exact reason. Regardless, Pokemon that can take them on like Kecleon and Murkrow can be used to switch into and KO them.</p> <p>Steel- and Rock-types have a harder time consistently switching into Hidden Power Ground, but they have an almost free switch into Sludge Bomb, meaning physically defensive Pokemon like Wailord and Mawile can be good teammates to take them on. Physically defensive Lickitung makes a good teammate in particular, as Swalot can easily switch into most Hitmonchan variants for it and Lickitung takes on most other physical attackers for Swalot in return.</p>"

Ice Beam is used as the general attacking move, as it hits the Ground-types looking to switch into Swalot for super effective or neutral damage and nails the Flying- and Grass-types that Swalot counters super effectively. Counter is a major move that sets Swalot apart from other defensive Pokemon like Chimecho and Sableye, giving it a tool to take a powerful physical attack and eliminate the attacker in one turn.</p> <p>Toxic is the best option in the third slot to allow Swalot to spread damage around defensive teams and force Chimecho to switch out or use Heal Bell or Rest. Yawn can be used to force switches, which works extra well with Spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Thunder Punch is another option for this slot to give Swalot amazing neutral coverage and let it hit the Water-types that can otherwise tank Ice Beam super effectively. The last slot goes to Explosion, which gives Swalot another tool to take out the foe and is a great way to ensure that the opponent can't use Swalot as setup bait for a sweeper like Vigoroth.</p> <p>A fully physically defensive EV spread gives Swalot the ability to counter physical threats as well as possible, with a Relaxed nature used because Swalot's Speed is largely unimportant and it doesn't weaken the power of Ice Beam or Explosion. Physical attacks such as Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground can be used over Ice Beam and Thunder Punch, but most of the physical threats that Swalot can counter have lower Special Defense (the major exception being Hitmonchan). Running a physical move also allows Swalot to run a neutral Speed nature, which can sometimes come in handy to get the Explosion off against a defensive Pokemon like Kecleon before getting hit.</p> <p>Chimecho is probably the best immediate safe switch-in to Swalot, as it destroys Swalot with its STAB Psychic, but it really needs to be wary of Explosion. Haunter with Psychic is probably a better switch-in to Swalot for this reason alone, though it takes far more damage from Ice Beam than Chimecho does. Still, these two Pokemon and others like Venomoth can be kind of threatening for Swalot, making specially defensive Pokemon like Kecleon and Lickitung good teammates that can form an almost impenetrable defensive core together with Swalot.</p> <p>Steel-types like Mawile and Metang are immune to Toxic and resist Ice Beam and Explosion, but they need to watch out for Counter. Mawile with Substitute, however, is particularly threatening for Swalot, and may force it to use Explosion or risk having it set up Swords Dance and Baton Passing to a teammate. Water- and Fire-types make good teammates for Swalot for this reason, Flareon in particular because it can pass Wish to Swalot on top of checking Mawile.</p> <p>Rock-types not weak to Ice Beam like Sudowoodo and Relicanth can nail Swalot super effectively with Earthquake and resist Explosion, though they too have to be extremely wary of Counter. A Grass-type like Bellossom or Tangela can be a good teammate to have to switch into Earthquake anyway, and they enjoy having Swalot around to tank attacks from Murkrow and Pidgeot.</p>"

Amazing mixed bulk, immunity to Toxic, and great longevity provided by RestTalk make this set extremely hard to take out, especially for balanced defensive teams. Ice Beam is Swalot's best general attacking move, as it sports good power and has no immunities, although Sludge Bomb can be used instead, as it has a good poison chance and hits slightly harder on neutral targets, in particular Hitmonchan, thanks to STAB, though at the cost of Swalot being completely walled by Steel-types if not also running Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p>Toxic pairs best with Ice Beam to spread as much residual damage as possible and allows Swalot to outstall certain threats like Sableye and Flareon, which cannot do much in return thanks to Swalot's immunity to Toxic. Sludge Bomb + Toxic may be kind of redundant and leaves Swalot completely exposed to Steel-types and Rock-types with Substitute, meaning Hidden Power Ground is the better move to run when using Sludge Bomb. Yawn is a viable third option for the second slot, but it doesn't really allow Swalot to outstall other Pokemon except for the chance to put Chimecho or Lickitung with Heal Bell to sleep.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature let Swalot avoid being 3HKOed by Timid Plusle's Thunderbolt and any of Choice Band Hitmonchan's attacks aside from Earthquake. There are a lot of moves that can be used in the first and second slots not mentioned above, and they depend largely on what your team needs. Counter is the most prominent and can ensure that Choice Band attackers think twice before trying to take out Swalot.</p> <p>Spikes are a near must with this set, meaning Roselia and Glalie are good teammates to consider. Chimecho is particularly dangerous for this set, as it can set up Calm Mind or use Heal Bell in front of Swalot without it being able to do much in return. Haunter also doesn't care for much of anything Swalot does with this set. Lickitung, Sableye, or an offensive check like Murkrow or Kecleon is an almost required teammate due to this fact. Steel-, Ground-, and Rock-types have an easier time with this set as well, as they don't need to really watch out for Counter, Explosion, or Hidden Power Ground in most cases. Defensive teammates like Pelipper and Relicanth or offensive checks like Hitmonchan are therefore needed to ensure that Swalot isn't just complete setup bait for these Pokemon.</p>"

Sharpedo also has a tendency to be walled by Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Blastoise due to its move choices, and it struggles to break bulkier Pokemon without heavy chip damage or Spikes and usually gets OHKOed in return because of its frailty, making it a difficult Pokemon to justify using. Rough Skin plays a big part in Sharpedo's niche in the tier, as it punishes physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Scyther by chipping them into range of its moves. Hydro Pump functions as Sharpedo's explosive STAB option, able to OHKO Solrock and Arcanine and smashing the likes of Omastar and Granbull while also being a generally powerful move to spam. Ice Beam is solid coverage for Grass-types like Vileplume and Cradily while also giving Sharpedo a more consistent way to OHKO Gligar and chunk Scyther.

Electrode, Solrock, and Glalie also help Sharpedo out tremendously thanks to Explosion, being able to lure in bulky Water- and Electric-types Sharpedo can struggle to deal with such as Lanturn, Ampharos, Tentacruel, and Walrein. Teammates that can switch into the aforementioned Electric-types, such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Nidoqueen work well with Sharpedo, as they can also help whittle down its checks for it to sweep late-game. Toxic support from teammates such as Omastar, Arcanine, and Tentacruel helps Sharpedo in its sweeping possibilities by giving it the chance to 2HKO opponents much more safely with the additional chip damage provided. Paralysis spreaders like Stun Spore Vileplume and Thunder Wave Misdreavus can also help Sharpedo get into a position to sweep, as well as allowing it to outspeed Scyther and Tentacruel without eating its Salac Berry.

Other physical variants of Wailord may seem appealing due to their stronger Self-Destruct and ability to run Earthquake to beat Plusle and Minun more reliably, but special sets are much more consistent. Wailord can run Toxic over Roar on its defensive set to slightly make up for passivity issues, but it's then complete setup fodder for Heal Bell + Calm Mind Chimecho and unable to do much versus Baton Pass teams. Water Spout may seem appealing for its great power when Wailord's at full health, 2HKOing Bulk Up Vigoroth, Lickitung after one layer of Spikes, and specially defensive Kecleon after three layers of Spikes. However, since Wailord will be pivoting into offensive threats often, this will rarely be the case, making it incredibly unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Although they can be taken out by Self-Destruct with minimal chip damage, Pokemon like Dewgong, opposing Wailord, Kecleon, and Lickitung can easily switch into Wailord and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-types</strong>: Roselia can generally switch into Wailord and set Spikes, although it must fear Ice Beam on the switch in. Bellossom outspeeds Wailord and can put it to sleep with Sleep Powder, letting it safely set Sunny Day and wreak havoc. Pikachu and Plusle can't switch into Wailord reliably at all, but they both threaten heavy damage with Thunderbolt, while Plusle can potentially lock defensive Wailord variants into Rest with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Even when invested in Defense, Wailord can be overwhelmed by physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Flareon, Hitmonchan, Pidgeot, and Raticate.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is generally used as Wailord's Water-type attack for its ability to 2HKO Pokemon like Chimecho, bulky Hitmonchan, and Vigoroth after one layer of Spikes. However, Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's accuracy isn't desired at the cost of significant power. Ice Beam 2HKOes Roselia most of the time and prevents other Grass-types like Bellossom and Cacturne from taking advantage of Wailord. Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Grass both target opposing Water-types, although Hidden Power Electric is usually preferred for its damage versus Pelipper. Self-Destruct lets Wailord lure in and remove special walls like Kecleon and Lickitung, as well as take out bulky Water-types like Dewgong and opposing Wailord more reliably. 44 Speed EVs let Wailord outspeed base 65 Pokemon like Roselia, Flareon, and Chimecho, with the remaining EVs making Wailord stronger and more capable of checking Pokemon like special Flareon and Huntail. Wailord can also choose to hit different Speed benchmarks, with outspeeding Dewgong, Bellossom, and Pupitar being notable options. If you're using Wailord as a lead, running 216 Speed EVs is an option to outspeed lead Choice Band Relicanth. A Mild nature can be used over Modest if weakening Self-Destruct's power isn't wanted. Although mostly useless, Water Veil protects against potential burns from Fire-type attacks as well as Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>The key to using this set is making the most out of Wailord's coverage. It's imperative to catch Pokemon like Roselia and Dewgong on the switch with Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric so Wailord can have an easier time using its STAB attack later in the game. Getting Wailord onto the field safely is also important so it can wallbreak. Bring it in versus Pokemon like special Crawdaunt, Seadra, and special Flareon that don't pose a great threat to it. Additionally, don't haphazardly use Self-Destruct, especially if the opponent hasn't revealed their full team yet, as this risks having a Steel- or Ghost-type come in on it. Doing so also risks losing to an unrevealed sweeper that Wailord could have kept in check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Glalie and Roselia benefits Wailord greatly, securing the 2HKO on opposing Roselia with Ice Beam while making it easier to get past specially defensive Pokemon like Dewgong, Kecleon, and opposing Wailord. Roselia also helps take on Electric- and Grass-types like Pikachu, Plusle, and Bellossom and benefits from Wailord checking Fire-types like Flareon and Torkoal. Wailord also appreciates having teammates like Murkrow, Pidgeot, and Diglett that can pressure dedicated special walls, with Diglett being able to trap and eliminate weakened ones as well as Pikachu. In return, Wailord can heavily pressure physically defensive Pokemon like Mawile, Torkoal, and Chimecho. Wailord also benefits from Baton Pass support from Mawile and Flareon, which can get it in against Pokemon like Metang, Torkoal, and Relicanth.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is Wailord's most consistent Water-type attacking option and lets it take out Fire- and Rock-types like Flareon, Torkoal, and Sudowoodo. Rest gives Wailord a boost in longevity, letting it consistently switch into threats like Flareon, Huntail, Chimecho, and Metang. Sleep Talk prevents Wailord from being entirely passive when asleep. Roar lets Wailord stop setup sweepers like Calm Mind Chimecho and Swords Dance Crawdaunt while also disrupting Baton Pass chains. 44 Speed EVs let Wailord outspeed base 65 Pokemon like Flareon and Roselia, while the remaining EVs make Wailord much bulkier. A Bold nature is viable so Wailord better checks Pokemon like physical Flareon, Hitmonchan, Choice Band Relicanth, and Pupitar. Although mostly useless, Water Veil protects against potential burns from Fire-type attacks as well as Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Using Wailord is very straightforward: switch it into Pokemon it checks such as Flareon and Octillery and force them out. While Wailord is a good check to Pokemon such as Torkoal and Metang, play around them with caution, as they can easily remove it with Explosion. It's also important to keep Wailord at a good amount of health with Rest, as between Spikes and super effective coverage moves, it risks losing to Pokemon it's supposed to check if it accumulates too much chip damage. Although Wailord isn't entirely passive when asleep thanks to Sleep Talk, keep in mind that certain Pokemon like Roselia, Bellossom, and Cacturne can still easily take advantage of it during those turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roselia and Cacturne are great partners for Wailord; they can check Electric-types like Pikachu and Plusle, and Spikes from them synergizes well with Wailord's ability to phaze foes with Roar. Roselia can also provide cleric support with Aromatherapy. In return, Wailord provides a sturdy Fire-type check. Because Wailord isn't great at pivoting into Normal- and Flying-types like Raticate, Pidgeot, and Murkrow, Ghost- and Steel-types like Haunter, Sableye, and Mawile pair excellently with it. Wailord is extremely passive without offensive investment; teammates like Hitmonchan, Choice Band Golbat, and offensive Flareon can make up for this. Hitmonchan can also provide Rapid Spin support to prevent Wailord from being worn down by Spikes, while Golbat and Flareon are good checks to Grass-types.</p>"

Fire Blast is its preferred Fire-type STAB move since it allows Numel to 2HKO Koffing and 3HKO Dustox. Flamethrower is an option with its better accuracy and greater PP since it still does well against the likes of Sunflora and Bayleef, but it fails to threaten Koffing and Dustox. RestTalk is the best recovery option to increase Numel's longevity. It's also worth mentioning that RestTalk gives Numel the ability to stall out Dustox in a 1v1 situation. Leftovers is preferred to rack up recovery against more passive opponents, while Chesto Berry works to give Numel the ability to keep threatening its enemies since being asleep can make it much more passive.</p> <p>Numel performs best on balance teams looking for something to handle Electric- and Fire-types like Elekid and Growlithe. It pairs well with Snorunt since Numel can switch into the leads that can beat it like Cyndaquil, Elekid, and Spoink, while Spikes from Snorunt give it a greater chance to take down Dustox with a 2HKO. Special attackers benefit from Numel's ability to safely switch into Dustox and Grimer to wear them down. Fast attackers and setup sweepers like Croconaw and Aipom appreciate Numel's ability as a status absorber with its typing and RestTalk. With its horrible physical bulk, Numel needs support from Pokemon that resist Normal-types, like Rhyhorn, Nosepass, and Lileep, to take hits from Aipom and Pidgeotto. Koffing is a great partner because it can help with offensive foes like Rhyhorn and Cubone that can OHKO Numel with Earthquake. Water-types like Seaking and Staryu threaten Numel because they can stomach an Earthquake and OHKO back with their 4x effective Water moves, so support from special walls like Dustox and Castform are needed. Numel can be taken advantage of when asleep, making Delcatty a solid teammate that can help remedy this with Heal Bell.</p>"

Timid Raikou's unboosted Crunch only hits for 23% - 25%, making Camerupt one of the best Calm Mind Raikou counters in the game. Though by far the most effective of its uses, Camerupt's walling potential is not limited to Electric-types. It switches in on Weezing with relative ease, though Sludge Bomb does take its toll. Heal Bell Celebi's Psychic only does 28% - 31%, while Fire Blast hits for 67% - 79%. While Camerupt doesn't exactly wall them, it can be used to beat Jirachi, Jynx, and Alakazam in a pinch. Wish Jirachi has only about a 1% chance of 2HKOing Camerupt with a +1 Psychic, while Camerupt has an 80.7% chance of 2HKOing Jirachi with Earthquake. Jynx and Alakazam miss out on the 2HKO and are both OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p>In UU, Camerupt stops, but falls short of beating, the ever popular Hypno + Vileplume combo.

      "overview": "<p>The immediate thing to notice about Cacturne is its access to Spikes. It is one of only three usable Spikers available in NU, meaning it has a very secure niche within the tier. On top of that, it has amazing mixed attacking stats and a decent offensive typing. With that said, it doesn't have a solid STAB move that can make use of its great attacking stats. What's more, it is very slow, extremely frail, and has an awful defensive typing in a tier dominated by Fighting-, Poison-, and Flying-types. Still, it has a lot of perks over Glalie and Roselia, and since Spikes is the only form of entry hazards in NU, you'll probably make a team with Cacturne on it at some point.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set and a Swords Dance set are both possible, but Cacturne's physical coverage is too lacking outside of Focus Punch and Hidden Power Ghost to really make use of Choice Band, and Cacturne isn't quite quick enough to sweep with Swords Dance. Counter is a good option for surprising an opponent using a non-super effective STAB move, but without Focus Sash in ADV it's really hard to pull off with Cacturne's frailty. Finally, Toxic and Grass Whistle are options as status moves, but Leech Seed or Encore will generally be more useful than either of those two.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Murkrow has an exceptionally easy time switching into Cacturne, as it resists both of Cacturne's STAB moves, resists Hidden Power Ghost, only really fears Thunder Punch or Focus Punch, and immediately threatens Cacturne with Drill Peck. Pidgeot can similarly switch in and threaten Cacturne with Aerial Ace, but it can't switch in quite as safely as Murkrow. Hitmonchan easily annihilates Cacturne with Sky Uppercut and resists Hidden Power Dark; it even spins away Cacturne's Spikes. Flareon can easily tank anything from the special attacking sets and can eliminate Cacturne with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Defensively, Swalot fears almost nothing from Cacturne and even enjoys switching into Leech Seed because of Liquid Ooze. Venomoth isn't even fazed by Cacturne's Grass-type attacks nor Focus Punch and threatens Cacturne with Sludge Bomb in return. Finally, defensive Bellossom and Roselia both generally beat Cacturne one-on-one due to their significantly higher special bulk and immunity to Leech Seed.</p>",

        "Offensive Spikes": {
          "description": "<p>This set combines all of Cacturne's best aspects to get as much mileage out of it as possible. The main reason you'd use Cacturne over Glalie or Roselia as a Spiker is that Cacturne is significantly harder to switch into, and with a wide array of coverage moves available, Cacturne ensures just that with this set. Giga Drain or Needle Arm should be used as Cacturne's primary STAB move. Giga Drain offers passive recovery, which can let Cacturne take on Water- and Rock-types slightly better, while Needle Arm has far more PP and has a chance to flinch the target. Hidden Power Dark is recommended as a secondary STAB move, and Dark-type attacks are hard to come by in the tier, which allows Cacturne to act as one of the few decent checks to Chimecho. However, Hidden Power Psychic can be used instead to nail Hitmonchan looking for a free switch in to spin away Cacturne's Spikes, and it also gets a decent hit on the Poison-types in the tier.</p> <p>Destiny Bond is a great tool for ensuring the opposing Pokemon goes down with Cacturne, and Cacturne is one of the few with access to the move in the tier. As a bonus, it may also scare the opponent into switching the next turn, freeing up time for Cacturne to lay another layer of Spikes. Because Cacturne is rather slow, Destiny Bond is kind of hard to use effectively or consistently, which is why Thunder Punch is also suggested in the last slot. Normally, Murkrow and Pidgeot have a fairly safe switch into Cacturne, but Thunder Punch ensures that that is not the case, OHKOing the former and easily 2HKOing the latter.</p> <p>A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Cacturne to outrun maximum Speed Jolly Pupitar, with the rest of the EVs pumped into Special Attack so that Cacturne hits as hard as possible. A special attacking set is preferred due to Cacturne's STAB types being special. As for other move options, Toxic is a decent option for crippling Hitmonchan and bulkier walls like Lickitung and Kecleon. Different Hidden Powers can be used depending on your team's needs, but Dark and Psychic are by far the most useful.</p> <p>Teams that don't want to use Glalie because of its typing and don't like Roselia because of its physical frailty will really like Cacturne. While it's frail both specially and physically, its resistances allow it to stand up to some attacks the other two cannot. Cacturne fits best on heavy offense teams since it doesn't last long itself but is capable of dishing out a ton of damage. Unfortunately, Hitmonchan probably has the easiest time switching into Cacturne out of the Spikers and can either easily OHKO it with Sky Uppercut or spin away Cacturne's Spikes. To combat Hitmonchan, Haunter and Chimecho are recommended as teammates, and they have decent synergy with Cacturne outside of checking Hitmonchan. Murkrow and Pidgeot easily switch into anything apart from Thunder Punch and threaten to KO Cacturne with their Flying-type STAB moves, making Rock-types like Relicanth and Sudowoodo and Steel-types like Mawile good teammates. Rock-types also make good use of the Spikes Cacturne sets up and lure in bulky Water-types, which Cacturne can then easily switch into and threaten out.</p>"

        "SubPunch": {
          "description": "<p>Despite the lack of STAB moves, this is Cacturne's hardest hitting set. Special attacking sets are far more common, and the Pokemon that counter those sets, such as Lickitung and Kecleon, are easily taken out by Focus Punch. Substitute is needed to allow Cacturne to fire off Focus Punch without flinching. Hidden Power Ghost forms perfect coverage with Focus Punch and is needed to hit Haunter and Chimecho. The last slot is mostly filler, but Leech Seed is probably the most useful option because it creates a makeshift SubSeed set, which can push some bulky Pokemon like Kingler into KO range of Focus Punch. However, Destiny Bond is a useful tool for threatening an instant KO against the foe. Both choices are great, and both allow an opportunity to fire off a free Focus Punch by forcing switches.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to hit as hard as possible while outrunning maximum Speed Modest Huntail. Running a Grass- or Dark-type STAB move in the last slot is an option, but they're pretty weak with an Adamant nature and no investment, even with Cacturne's high Special Attack stat. Other physical move options include Brick Break and Double-Edge for a strong, reliable attack when without a Substitute. Glalie is an ideal teammate for this set, as Cacturne forces a lot of switches between Focus Punch and Leech Seed or Destiny Bond, and Spikes helps capitalize on those forced switches.</p> <p>This set can lure in and take out common switch-ins to Cacturne like Hitmonchan and Murkrow, meaning Pokemon that can sweep with their removal are good teammates. Rock-types, Pupitar in particular, love having Hitmonchan out of the picture. Hitmonchan of your own and Chimecho love having Murkrow and Pidgeot out of the way. This set is probably the best switch-in to Chimecho in the tier, particularly Calm Mind variants, as most don't carry a move that can hit Cacturne effectively, while Cacturne can easily 2HKO Chimecho by targeting its weaker defensive stat. This fact further increases the synergy between Cacturne and Hitmonchan and also makes Cacturne a valued teammate of Poison-types like Haunter and Arbok. Finally, this set is totally walled by Swalot, making Ground-types like Piloswine good teammates as well.</p>"

        "Support": {
          "description": "<p>This set combines Cacturne's good offensive presence and its ability to set Spikes, disrupt the opponent's team, and force switches. In order to get the best out of this set, switch in on a foe using a setup or status move like Reflect and use Encore on it. From there, set up Spikes, or if you can predict what Pokemon your opponent is going to switch to, use the appropriate STAB move. Hidden Power Dark is more useful than Needle Arm for its broader neutral coverage, higher power, and ability to rip apart Chimecho and Haunter. The best options over Needle Arm are Leech Seed and Substitute, both of which best utilize the switches Encore will force and can lead to even more switches by the opponent.</p> <p>The Speed EVs outspeed minimum base 60 Speed Pokemon and max Speed Adamant Sudowoodo as a bonus. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to give Cacturne a bit of bulk, and Special Attack is maxed out to make use of Cacturne's Special Attack as best as possible. However, the EVs as a whole are pretty flexible, and EVs can be moved from Special Attack or Speed to the defenses to better cushion common attacks Cacturne resists like Earthquake and Surf.</p> <p>As a support Pokemon, this set is less dependent on having teammates that support it, but having teammates that can capitalize on the Spikes Cacturne provides is important. Offensive Pokemon like Pidgeot, Raticate, Hitmonchan, and Vigoroth are good examples of Pokemon that make use of Spikes and enjoy having Cacturne's offensive presence on the team to remove problematic Pokemon like Rock-types and Chimecho. Cacturne also has an easy time switching in on defensive Pokemon like Whiscash and Lickitung and forcing them out with Encore, making it a good partner for Fire-types and special attackers like Plusle.</p>"

Thanks to Natural Cure, when Altaria uses Rest, it instantly wakes up after switching out. Its defensive stats are great, and it has the support moves to use them. That's why a set with more of a stalling mentality is recommended. However, the Dragon Dance set with Sing can really surprise people when you put their counter to sleep.</p>",

It can come in to sponge a hit, Heal Bell to cure Toxics, Sleep Powders and whatnot, maybe Rest off any damage taken, and switch out to come back later.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For Dragon Dancing sets, keep Speed at the magic 200, focus a little bit on Attack, giving it an Adamant nature, even if you're using a Fire-type move, then dump the rest in HP and defenses. For a stalling set, you'll want to take advantage of Altaria's defenses, which are actually her best stats. Give her around 200 Speed, and then max HP, with any remaining EVs going into Defense and Special Defense, with most of the emphasis on Special Defense, as it is not only her greatest stat, but Ice Beam is her greatest fear, and you want to be able to survive it. Give her a Careful nature. That should just about do it for our little cotton soprano here.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your best choices would be Hypno and Grumpig for the special attacker, albeit watch out for Toxics. Blastoise and Walrein pretty much stop Altaria all the time. If it's a Dragon Dancer, just send in your Solrock or Lunatone.

Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Water-types in general and Quagsire in particular. Dragon Claw can be used as an attack for the \"Flameclaw\" combo, which nothing resists, but Dragon Claw really isn't going to be hurting much, so it's not recommended.

Gengar, Dusclops, and other Ghost-types work well if Zangoose doesn't pack Shadow Ball. Tyranitar can take even a +2 Hidden Power Ground and deal heavy damage in return, but it is OHKOed by +2 Brick Break. The sandstorm it summons can thwart Flail sets, however. Metagross can shrug off anything Zangoose throws at it--even Hidden Power Ground doesn't OHKO --while KOing back with Meteor Mash. Rhydon can do the same, except it's also weak to Brick Break. Golem too works similarly, though it's not as effective as it might not OHKO with Earthquake.

Brick Break and Hidden Power Ground are also viable options should you fear Zangoose being walled by Rock- and Steel-types; Brick Break hits Tyranitar harder, potentially OHKOing with an Adamant nature, whereas Hidden Power Ground hits Metagross and Jirachi harder than Return does.

There are three options for the last moveslot: Fire Blast will 2HKO or 3HKO Skarmory, and takes it down far more effectively than Focus Punch will. Focus Punch has the advantage when it comes to Rock-types such as Tyranitar, however. Swords Dance can further strengthen Zangoose's Flail; a resisted 1 HP Flail is as powerful as a neutral Focus Punch.</p> <p>The EVs listed provide Zangoose with enough Speed to outrun neutral Heracross, which is particularly useful if running Fire Blast.

Poison is also a nice typing to switch into opposing Pokemon, and an offensive Pokemon that can switch into Choice Band Hitmonchan's STAB attacks is always a plus. Beyond that, though, it doesn't have much going for it. Shed Skin is neat to absorb status from defensive teams, but Seviper is super frail and a bit on the slow side. It languishes at the bottom of the pack for mixed attackers, as it ultimately doesn't offer that much over similar options in Crawdaunt, Cacturne, and Octillery and finds itself wanting either more bulk or more Speed in most battles.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There is a huge variety of combinations of the moves mentioned above that Seviper can run that are certainly doable. Going mixed will always keep your opponent guessing as to what moves Seviper is or isn't using and can definitely lead to some misplays by them. Substitute can be used when going mixed to further ease prediction on Seviper's part, as well as raise the anxiety of your opponent to keep them guessing as to what Seviper is running.</p> <p>Most of Seviper's viable moves were listed above, but there are a couple left worth mentioning. Glare is probably done better by Arbok, but it does give Seviper a tool to use against faster Pokemon thinking they can switch into a predicted attacking move. Taunt allows Seviper to mess with defensive Pokemon like Lickitung and Flareon and prevent them from healing, but overall Seviper is a bit too frail to make very good use of it. Finally, Seviper is one of the few Pokemon in the tier with access to Haze, which could be valuable in preventing a dangerous setup sweeper from sweeping your team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In general, Chimecho can tank an attack from Seviper and easily OHKO it back with STAB Psychic; it just needs to be careful of Crunch and Hidden Power Ghost, both of which will leave a huge dent in it. Haunter and Venomoth with Psychic can easily outspeed and OHKO Seviper as well, though the latter needs a layer of Spikes to ensure the KO. Ground-types that can tank a Flamethrower or Giga Drain will easily OHKO Seviper with Earthquake, which admittedly is mostly just Piloswine. Other Pokemon that outspeed with Earthquake will have an easy time with Seviper too, particularly Hitmonchan, Glalie, and Vigoroth. Fire-types have the easiest time with the special attacker set if it lacks Hidden Power Water, but they have a very hard time with the physical sets. Finally, Mawile and Metang need to avoid the special attacker and mixed sets, but they have a very easy time against the Choice Band set as long as they avoid Earthquake.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Seviper is incredibly hard to switch into, and this set makes the most of that fact by focusing on smashing through as many walls in the metagame as possible. STAB Sludge Bomb coming off a base 100 Attack stat will dent nearly everything, and it easily OHKOes offensive Bellossom, deals over 50% to 252 HP Kecleon, and will 2HKO specially defensive Lickitung after a layer of Spikes the vast majority of the time. Earthquake smashes Flareon, easily 2HKOes specially defensive Swalot, and thrashes Lairon. Flamethrower OHKOes 252 HP Mawile and Tangela after a layer of Spikes and easily 2HKOes Metang. The last slot goes to a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Grass shreds Relicanth, Whiscash, Graveler, and other Rock-types like Sudowoodo. Hidden Power Ghost is Seviper's best hit on Chimecho and Haunter, but it will miss out on the 2HKO on 252/252+ Chimecho.</p> <p>A Naughty nature with maximum Attack ensures the strongest hit from Sludge Bomb as possible and OHKOes Bellossom after Spikes. The Speed EVs are there to outpace max Speed neutral nature Pupitar and Tropius, as well as the more common max Speed neutral-natured base 50s like Piloswine. The rest is pumped into Special Attack and gives Seviper the ability to OHKO Mawile and Tangela where it needs to.</p> <p>While Seviper has the ability to outspeed most walls in the metagame and deal a good amount of damage to nearly all of them, it finds itself outsped by nearly every other offensive Pokemon in the tier, meaning Seviper will be playing a game of tit for tat almost every battle. In order to make the best use of Seviper, very sturdy defensive partners are a must to allow it to threaten a KO against the opposing Pokemon and have a safe passage out of the battlefield when something faster steps up to the plate. Relicanth, Kecleon, and Torkoal are good examples of Pokemon that can allow this, particularly the former, as it is a hard stop to Pidgeot and Murkrow as well other Choice Band users like Kingler and Raticate. Kecleon is also valuable to almost hard counter Chimecho and Haunter, as they'll likely switch in to OHKO Seviper with Psychic.</p> <p>An offensive teammate to make use of Seviper's ability to wallbreak is a definite must when considering using this set. Huntail is a prime example, particularly because one of the few walls that can stand up to Seviper, Sableye, is an extremely easy setup opportunity and Huntail has no problem blowing past it with Hydro Pump. In return, Seviper severely dents the likes of Kecleon, Lickitung, and Dewgong, even almost 2HKOing the latter with Sludge Bomb, and can lure in Chimecho and cripple it with Hidden Power Ghost. Other good offensive teammates include those that require turns of setup to become threatening, such as Vigoroth, Pupitar, and Kingler.</p>"

Flamethrower blows away Steel-types thinking they're safe switching into Seviper's STAB move, dealing a ton of damage to both Mawile and Metang. Flamethrower also does a number on the Grass- and Bug-types in the tier. Giga Drain annihilates the Ground- and Rock-types that think they can safely nail Seviper with Earthquake. Crunch obliterates Chimecho and Haunter and is Seviper's best hit on Pelipper apart from Hidden Power Electric. The last slot goes to a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Psychic can be used to nail Hitmonchan and opposing Poison-types, while Hidden Power Water can be used to get a great hit on Lairon, Magcargo, and Flareon. Hidden Power Ice is worth considering as well for its super effective hit on Flying-types and Shelgon.</p> <p>A Modest nature and maximum Speed are run to give Seviper as much power as possible while retaining the ability to Speed tie with neutral-natured max Speed Flareon and Chimecho as well as outspeed Jolly Pupitar. Timid is definitely an option to outrun Timid Tangela and minimum Speed Dewgong, but considering the overall low Base Power of Seviper's moves and the lack of STAB, Modest is generally better to get as many KOs as possible.</p> <p>Rest can be run in the last slot, as Shed Skin has a high chance of waking Seviper up early, but it's unreliable and Seviper can't waste any turns sleeping due to its frailty. That said, Shed Skin is a reason enough to boldly switch Seviper into defensive Grass-types for its chance to absorb Sleep Powder or Stun Spore and be able to shrug it off.</p> <p>This set ravages slow defensive teams, but it has a couple of hard stops, most notably special walls like Kecleon, Swalot, Flareon, and Sableye. Because of this, Hitmonchan and other strong physical wallbreakers like Vigoroth and Pupitar make good teammates. Seviper is also very prone to being revenge killed, particularly from the likes of Choice Band Murkrow, which can OHKO it after a layer of Spikes, and other strong attackers like Haunter, which also OHKOes with Psychic. Due to this, hefty defensive backbones that can keep offensive momentum like Choice Band Relicanth and SubPunch Kecleon make excellent teammates. Chimecho also makes a good partner to take on the likes of Haunter and Hitmonchan looking to revenge kill Seviper.</p>"

The only downside is that overall a Choice Band set is done slightly better by Arbok, which sports higher Speed and better bulk backed up by Intimidate. Still, Seviper packs more power, and because Seviper has the element of surprise with its massive special movepool, it's still a highly recommended set when considering Seviper for your team.</p> <p>Sludge Bomb and Earthquake have really good coverage together, with the latter providing super effective hits on enemy Poison-, Steel-, and Rock-types that resist or are immune to Sludge Bomb. Hidden Power Ghost is for Haunter and gets a slightly stronger hit on Chimecho than Sludge Bomb does. Unfortunately, Seviper doesn't get Rock Slide, another perk Arbok sports over its slithery friend, but the last slot here is largely filler anyway. Iron Tail is a good safety move, minus the accuracy, that ensures a super effective hit on Rock-types when using Earthquake could lead to a free switch to a Flying-type or a Levitate user by the opponent. Double-Edge is stronger and more reliable overall than Iron Tail, but this comes at the cost of any super effective coverage.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Speed are run to give Seviper as much power as possible while retaining the ability to Speed tie with neutral-natured max Speed Flareon and Chimecho. Jolly is definitely an option, as outspeeding neutral Flareon and Chimecho with this set is heavenly, but the drop in power isn't worth it in the long run. A Naughty nature can be used with a special move, particularly Giga Drain, in the last slot, which gives Seviper a much better tool to use against Whiscash and other physically bulkier Pokemon that resist Sludge Bomb like Relicanth and Graveler.</p> <p>This set has a hard time with Rock- and Steel-types, even with Earthquake available, making a physical sweeping partner such as Hitmonchan or a special attacker like Seadra or Haunter valued teammates. Defensive Chimecho can be lured in and eliminated, or at the very least sufficiently weakened, with Hidden Power Ghost, further making Hitmonchan and other Pokemon walled by it, like Plusle, good teammates to bring when using Seviper. A switch-in to Flying-types and Haunter is needed for this set to be successful, as they will gladly switch into a Choice-locked Earthquake at the first chance they get, meaning physically defensive Pokemon like Relicanth and specially defensive Pokemon like Kecleon should be paired with Seviper as well. In the same vein, having a good answer to Mawile is crucial to this set's success, as it will use its immunity to Sludge Bomb to set up Substitute or Swords Dance without hesitation, making Flareon a good teammate as well.</p>"

Whiscash, on the other hand, has what is possibly the best typing in the game and access to STAB Earthquake, effectively letting it take on several top threats, such as Haunter, Pikachu, and Pupitar, that Wailord can struggle against. However, despite just how good the Water / Ground typing is, the 4x weakness to Grass is what really lowers Whiscash's standing in the tier; Grass is a popular coverage type on wallbreakers, Fire-types like Flareon, and Water-types like Dewgong and Wailord, since there are many Pokemon that share Whiscash's unfortunate 4x weakness. If you can cover Whiscash's abhorration of the green stuff it'll pull its weight in any match.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set is perfectly doable thanks to Whiscash's high bulk and access to Earthquake, but its overall lack of power and meaningful coverage leave it outclassed by similar users like Relicanth and Metang. A fully specially defensive set is possible but ultimately strictly outclassed by Dewgong and Wailord due to Whiscash's unfortunate weakness to Grass-type attacks, which makes it an ineffective check to Fire- and Water-types that typically carry Hidden Power Grass. Rock Tomb and Icy Wind are interesting options considering Whiscash's middling Speed stat, potentially allowing it to tank an attack from, say, Haunter and finish it off the following turn with Surf. Spark is a cool option that allows Whiscash to run Grass, Electric, and Ice coverage all in one moveset, something very few other Pokemon can accomplish in NU, but Whiscash's Special Attack is pretty lackluster to make the most of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bellossom is probably the best overall switch-in to Whiscash, as it resists Whiscash's STAB attacks, doesn't take too much from Ice Beam, and can easily OHKO Whiscash with its Grass-type STAB moves. Roselia and Tangela will also both easily KO Whiscash but need to be more careful around Earthquake and Ice Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pelipper, Wailord, and other bulky Water-types will usually take a pittance from Whiscash's moves and can threaten back with Hidden Power Grass more than it can threaten them, but all will dislike getting inflicted by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Especially strong physical attackers will still break even maximum Defense Whiscash, such as Bulk Up Vigoroth and Hitmonchan at +2.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Most of anything else with a Grass-type attack, such as Haunter, Flareon, and Huntail, can consider itself an effective check to Whiscash.</p>",

        "Physically Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With maximum Defense investment, Whiscash is physically bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Metang and Hitmonchan, giving it an immediate niche in the tier. Physically defensive Whiscash vies for a team slot with Relicanth and Wailord, but there are a couple of things that make Whiscash worth using over both. While Relicanth resists Normal- and Flying-type attacks and Wailord is a better Fire-type check by virtue of being less susceptible to Grass-type attacks and has Roar, Whiscash has an easier time offensively beating back Hitmonchan, resists Rock and is immune to Electric, and more easily takes on special attackers like Haunter (assuming they lack Grass-type coverage). Earthquake and Ice Beam have very good coverage together and prevent Pokemon like Substitute Tropius from being able to take advantage of Whiscash even if it's asleep. RestTalk provides Whiscash with great longevity and allows it to absorb status for the team. Protect + Toxic is another option if you feel RestTalk leaves Whiscash too vulnerable, with Toxic allowing Whiscash to cripple most Pokemon that aren't too threatened by its coverage moves, notably other bulky Pokemon like Wailord and Chimecho.</p> <p>A more balanced EV spread can be used to turn Whiscash into a more of a blanket check and try to make the most of its set of resistances. With a spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 112 SpD and a Sassy nature, Whiscash is still physically bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Murkrow's Drill Peck and specially bulky enough to just barely survive a Fire Blast followed by a Hidden Power Grass from maximum Special Attack Flareon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes can heavily pressure Whiscash and make it harder for it to check the physical attackers it needs to, such as Choice Band Metang and Relicanth, making Rapid Spin support from Hitmonchan highly valued to get the most out of Whiscash. In the same vein, Spikes support of your own will allow Whiscash to nab some KOs it can otherwise miss out on, such as an OHKO on Pupitar and a 2HKO on Choice Band Hitmonchan. Roselia is the best Spiker to pair with Whiscash, as it completely covers Whiscash's Grass-type weakness, can easily switch in on opposing Wailord, and can provide cleric support, and in return, Whiscash deals with a large majority of the physical attackers that give Roselia trouble. Other cleric options to consider pairing Whiscash with so that it doesn't have to rely on Sleep Talk rolls include Chimecho and Lickitung.</p>"

        "Substitute Stallbreaker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set merges Whiscash's offensive and defensive potential to mold it into a deadly stallbreaker when used correctly. Whiscash's typing is perfectly suited to counteract the most common stall and defensive archetypes in the tier, with only other bulky Water-types standing in Whiscash's way of total team decimation. With the moves and EV spread given, Whiscash can create 101 HP Substitutes, giving it a totally free setup against standard physically defensive Sableye and letting it cleanly 2HKO it with Surf. Roselia, Flareon, and Mawile are all easily 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Substitute protects Whiscash from the former two's Grass-type attacks. The last slot is dedicated to how you want Whiscash to handle the opponent's bulky Water- or Grass-type. Ice Beam will absolutely shred Tangela and deals a decent chunk to offensive Bellossom, and Earthquake + Ice Beam has pretty stellar coverage in the tier. Toxic is the best all-around choice for weakening Dewgong, Wailord, and Bellossom in the long run but is easily worked around if the opponent has a cleric or RestTalk user. Hidden Power Grass deals some decent chip damage to Wailord and especially other Whiscash and Relicanth. It's not recommended to deviate from the EV spread given, as it is specifically tailored to achieve the KOs Whiscash needs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Whiscash set thrives on Spikes support to weaken the opponent's bulky Water-type and help Whiscash nab the KOs that it wants to. Roselia is the best option, as it covers Whiscash's Grass-type weakness perfectly, although this set also fits well on the offensive teams that Glalie works best on. Pokemon that can lure in and eliminate the opponent's Water-type will also work wonders here, with an Explosion lure such as Torkoal or Metang making a particularly good choice. Finally, Pokemon that work best with the opponent's stall core broken up are needed to make the most of this set. Late-game sweepers such as Huntail and Bellossom would be among the best choices.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt stands out in the tier for sporting amazing mixed attacking stats and featuring a decent typing to make use of them. Having no physical STAB move is a letdown though, especially considering its incredible base 120 Attack stat, but its base 90 Special Attack is still fantastic by NU standards. It also has great coverage, both physical and special, meaning that once Crawdaunt steps onto the battlefield, something's getting hurt. Unfortunately, getting Crawdaunt in is hard considering its subpar bulk, and its low Speed means it'll be unlikely to sweep the opponent's team anytime soon. Still, if it's an unpredictable wallbreaker you're looking for, Crawdaunt is a fine candidate for offensive teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The only major moves not mentioned above that are done well by Crawdaunt are Endeavor and Counter. Counter is extremely hard to use due to Crawdaunt's frailty, but from behind a teammate's Reflect it can be used effectively. Endeavor could see use on a Salac Berry set, but it is also pretty hard to use. As for other move choices, Icy Wind is an interesting move to cripple a potential revenge killer and give Crawdaunt the opportunity to threaten a KO with an appropriate move. Knock Off is a great move in general to remove the longevity of certain walls likely to switch into Crawdaunt, like Sableye and Wailord.</p> <p>Most other sets available to Crawdaunt are done better by Kingler, which sports slightly higher Attack, significantly higher Speed, a lack of a Fighting-type weakness, and better physical bulk. This includes, in particular, any Swords Dance or Salac Berry sets as well as any combination of the two.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Probably the best overall switch-in to Crawdaunt is Sableye, which really only fears Surf from the special attacking set or the rare Toxic or Taunt. Otherwise, it easily switches into most attacks from the Choice Band set and can outstall Crawdaunt with Toxic and Recover or use it as setup fodder for Calm Mind. Relicanth also switches into most attacks from the Choice Band set without fear, save for the uncommon Hidden Power Grass, and it can retaliate with its Rock-type STAB moves. However, Relicanth must be careful around the special attacking set. Tangela only fears Ice Beam and Sludge Bomb from the Choice Band set, but it cannot switch into anything very safely from the special attacking set. Rock-types and Mawile can easily tank Double-Edge or Return from the Choice Band set, but most of the other moves will leave a hefty dent or KO them if the opponent predicts wrong. In general, bulky Water-types like physically defensive Whiscash and Wailord can switch into most attacks from the Choice Band set, save for Double-Edge, and they fear little from the special attacking set.</p> <p>Hitmonchan, Plusle, Haunter, and most strong special attackers with a super effective move can revenge kill Crawdaunt without much issue, but they really cannot switch into anything safely. Finally, most strong physical attackers like Choice Band Piloswine can tank a physical attack and OHKO in return.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Mixed Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>A Choice Band set is probably the best way to make the best use of Crawdaunt's massive base 120 Attack stat, despite the lack of physical STAB moves. Double-Edge is Crawdaunt's strongest physical move and will hit like a truck, being only marginally weaker than Choice Band Raticate's own STAB-boosted Double-Edge. Return is a viable alternative if the recoil is unappealing and will still be Crawdaunt's strongest available physical move on the set. Hidden Power Ghost is used to annihilate Haunter and is Crawdaunt's best weapon against Chimecho, which Crawdaunt can generally switch into without much fear if it lacks Hidden Power Electric. Brick Break takes out Mawile, Lickitung, and Kecleon and will generally be used as a safety move. The last slot is saved for a special move to allow Crawdaunt to eliminate those targets that either resist its physical moves or just have substantially more Defense than Special Defense. Surf is boosted by STAB and is Crawdaunt's best weapon for Piloswine, physically defensive Sableye, Rock-types like Sudowoodo and Lairon, and Mawile, 2HKOing it after a layer of Spikes. Ice Beam can be used instead to take out Tangela, and it still hits some Rock-types harder than Crawdaunt's other moves, particularly Graveler. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is an option over Hidden Power Ghost to completely devastate Relicanth and Whiscash more than Crawdaunt's other options.</p> <p>The EV spread maxes out Attack to give Crawdaunt's physical moves as much damage output as possible, and enough Speed is run to outspeed minimum Speed base 70s like Dewgong. The rest is dumped into Special Attack to beef up the power of Crawdaunt's special move of choice.</p> <p>Crawdaunt's movepool is actually pretty extensive, and there are a few viable alternatives that can be run in the last slot. Going fully physical is definitely an option, with the Special Attack EVs then moved into Speed, which then ensures Crawdaunt can get the jump on maximum Speed Modest Bellossom and Huntail before they set up weather. If going fully physical, Sludge Bomb is probably the best option for the last slot, as it completely destroys Bellossom and even OHKOes uninvested Tangela. Hidden Power Rock is another great choice, as it has neutral coverage and is a good safety move to have, but nearly every target that it's super effective against takes about the same damage from Double-Edge anyway. Other special moves that can be run in the last slot include Crunch and Crabhammer, but they're generally less effective than the other options. Choice Band can be dropped in favor of Leftovers, which allows Crawdaunt the ability to switch moves and pummel the opposition with the correct move, but a lot of power is lost on its physical attacks if taking this route.</p> <p>Crawdaunt's role on a team with this set is to open holes in the opposition for another physical sweeper to come in later in the match and clean up the remains. Good options to do so are those that enjoy having Rock-types weakened or out of the way like Pidgeot and Murkrow, as well as generally good physical sweepers like Raticate, Vigoroth, and Hitmonchan. There's little that can actually switch into Crawdaunt completely safely, though Relicanth stands out as the most prominent if Hidden Power Grass isn't run, so having a switch-in to it such as Hitmonchan or a Grass-type like Tangela is desirable. Sableye also doesn't fear much from this set, being immune to Double-Edge and Brick Break and taking little from Hidden Power Ghost or the special move. Bringing a strong special attacker like Bellossom or Flareon to smash it to pieces would be a good idea when using Crawdaunt. Torkoal also switches into this set quite easily, even if Crawdaunt has Surf, making a Rock-type of your own like Magcargo or Sudowoodo a good teammate to have.</p> <p>Plusle and Grass-types cannot switch directly into Crawdaunt, but they do easily OHKO it once they get in, so having a teammate to tank their attacks and allow Crawdaunt to switch out is a good idea. Whiscash, Kecleon, and Swalot can all do this pretty well and mesh with Crawdaunt's typing pretty well too. Finally, Hitmonchan itself is pretty threatening for Crawdaunt, so having a teammate like Chimecho or Sableye is a good idea too.</p>"

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>A straight out-and-out special attacking set makes the best use of Crawdaunt's great base 90 Special Attack and special STAB moves, allowing it to surprise its normal switch-ins and deal a ton of damage to many targets in the tier in general. The main advantage Crawdaunt sports over the other special attacking Water-types in the tier is its access to STAB Crunch, which nearly OHKOes 252 HP Chimecho, and its surprise factor. Ice Beam pairs very nicely with Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and shreds Tangela apart while dealing a nice chunk of damage to Bellossom and Roselia. The last slot can go to Hidden Power Electric to get a super effective hit on Water-types like Pelipper and Huntail. However, Substitute can be used instead to protect Crawdaunt from revenge killers and status, and it allows Crawdaunt to more easily select the correct move for the situation. Another viable option for the last slot is Taunt, which is Crawdaunt's only real hope of being able to break past Sableye effectively and can trip up other defensive switch-ins like Dewgong, Swalot, and Wailord pretty nicely.</p> <p>There isn't much point to running any HP investment, considering Crawdaunt's terrible overall bulk, so maximum Speed is run to give Crawdaunt the edge against Modest Bellossom and Huntail. A Timid nature is an option as well, but making full use of Crawdaunt's good Special Attack is recommended, despite Timid coming with the advantage of outspeeding Timid Bellossom and Huntail. Going mixed is not recommended either, as then you are playing with a slightly worse version of the Choice Band set, and the only physical move of note that's really missed with this set is Brick Break.</p> <p>Toxic is a good move to run in the last slot as well, as it is Crawdaunt's best general weapon against special walls like Kecleon and Dewgong, both of which Crawdaunt has no real hope of breaking past otherwise. Hitmonchan makes a good partner to smash these as well as other special walls like Lickitung, and together Hitmonchan and Crawdaunt make a pretty fearsome offensive core, as Hitmonchan loves Crawdaunt's ability to remove Chimecho from the picture. Plusle and Grass-types have a really hard time switching into this set, but once in, they can obliterate Crawdaunt with their STAB move of choice. Because of this, Whiscash, Roselia, Swalot, and Flareon make good teammates to switch into them and force them out. Finally, Hitmonchan can switch into this set pretty easily, though it takes upwards of 50% from Surf, and it can OHKO Crawdaunt with Sky Uppercut; Chimecho and Sableye thus make good teammates.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Claydol plays a fundamental role in ADV OU as one of the best spinners in the metagame. Spinning away Spikes is a great source of support for its teammates, and having a spinner that is immune to Spikes like Claydol is a godsend for many teams. Furthermore, Claydol's immunity to sand and good defensive typing raise its profile as a spinner, despite Starmie's higher Speed and ability to pressure Skarmory. Claydol also packs a Rock resistance and a Ground immunity that allow it to pivot into common attacks like Rock Slide and Earthquake from the likes of Tyranitar and Aerodactyl, and its Electric immunity is handy for pivoting into Thunderbolt from Zapdos and Jolteon.</p> <p>However, Claydol's lack of a recovery move means it cannot take repeated hits from attacks like Tyranitar's Hidden Power Bug, Zapdos's Hidden Power Grass, and Aerodactyl's Double-Edge. Additionally, despite Claydol's good defensive typing, it cannot threaten back a lot of the Pokemon that it's supposed to check without committing to Explosion. Furthermore, it tends to lose momentum when it goes for a Rapid Spin, as six glaring weaknesses to common attacking types like Water, Ice, Grass, and Bug mean it can be taken advantage by threats such as Heracross and offensive Water-types, and it's often forced to blow up to prevent setup from threats like Calm Mind Celebi and Calm Mind Suicune. Additionally, Claydol can't make progress by switching directly into the opposing Spiker if it's Cloyster, Hidden Power Bug Forretress, or Drill Peck Skarmory, as it will be forced out, leaving at least one layer of Spikes on the field; however, against Toxic + Protect Skarmory it can stay in safely as long as it has Refresh.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be run in order to better deal with the Dragon-types Salamence and Flygon, but it generally is not worth giving up another move for it. The same goes for Hidden Power Fire and Toxic; one could say that Claydol is a good example of four-moveslot syndrome for this very reason.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Claydol's offensive presence outside of Explosion is so minimal that there's no shortage of defensive checks for it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types stand out as the best defensive checks, as they don't fear any of Claydol's attacks; meanwhile, they threaten it with super effective damage but need to watch out for Explosion ending the turn and putting them in KO range of a follow-up sweeper.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is the only spinblocker in OU and can threaten Claydol with status or super effective attacks, but since it doesn't want to switch into Psychic or Shadow Ball, good prediction is required for it to successfully spinblock Claydol. If Gengar happens to switch freely on a Rapid Spin, remember that Ice Punch and Giga Drain hurt Claydol considerably, on top of the threat of Will-O-Wisp, Hypnosis, Destiny Bond and Explosion; this means that Claydol shouldn't try to stay in and push its luck against Gengar but instead just plan to keep wearing it down as it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit trappers are also quite annoying for Claydol to face because they can inflict chip damage every time it switches out; Umbreon is the most annoying of the bunch because it doesn't fear any of Claydol's attacks. The combination of a Pursuit trapper, a Spiker, and a spinblocker is the toughest one for Claydol to beat, with a single mistake possibly deciding the outcome of the Spikes war.</p> <p><strong>Spikers</strong>: Finally, it's worth pointing out that, despite Claydol's main asset being to spin away Spikes, it cannot meaningfully hurt the Spikers themselves; Drill Peck Skarmory can take any of Claydol's attacks and force it out with repeated chip damage, while Taunt + Toxic Skarmory can keep even Refresh Claydol poisoned. Claydol also faces similar issues dealing with Cloyster.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rapid Spin separates Claydol from the other Ground-types in OU, as spinning away Spikes is Claydol's main source of support for the team. STAB Earthquake can 2HKO Tyranitar, Jirachi, and most Metagross; additionally, Claydol can threaten Gengar if it dares to spinblock with its STAB Psychic, which can also be used to chip a Heracross or a Breloom attempting to switch in.</p> <p>Explosion gives Claydol some much-needed utility as a wallbreaker and also helps it to check offensive threats by preventing them from freely setting up in its face. In fact, every Pokemon that doesn't resist Explosion has to be fearful of its threat, including setup sweepers like Suicune and Snorlax, as well as walls like Blissey, Celebi, and Milotic and offensive threats like Zapdos, Moltres, and Salamence; however, make sure to use Explosion wisely against Spikes teams, because by losing your only spinner you will leave yourself open to common Spikes attackers such as Jolteon and Aerodactyl. Refresh is an alternative when Claydol is used on stall teams that can't make good use of Explosion, allowing it to spin safely against Toxic + Protect Skarmory without fear of getting poisoned and being very useful for pivoting into status spreaders like Toxic Blissey and Zapdos, as well as Body Slam Jirachi. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Psychic, as it hits opposing Claydol for super effective damage, but it fails to beat Will-O-Wisp Gengar; note that Refresh is not a reliable solution to the burn, as Gengar can pressure Claydol with Taunt.</p> <p>Claydol isn't normally very threatening, but this set is more offensively minded than others, with enough offensive investment to hurt key threats in OU such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Jirachi, and Gengar with its STAB attacks. 216 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Claydol to always 2HKO maximum HP Tyranitar with Earthquake and hit hard with Explosion, while 32 Special Attack EVs guarantee the 2HKO of specially defensive Gengar in sand with Psychic. If using Shadow Ball instead of Psychic, one should put the Special Attack EVs in Attack for even greater damage output. Alternatively, Claydol can run a faster spread of 28 HP / 216 Atk / 32 SpA / 232 Spe; this is more suited for offensive teams that want to outspeed and cripple offensive Swampert and maximum Speed Tyranitar. Another common spread for Claydol is 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpD with a Relaxed nature, which maximizes Claydol's resilience as a pivot into physical threats like Tyranitar and Aerodactyl; note that you should always pair this Claydol with Dugtrio, as otherwise Pursuit Tyranitar can be a problem.</p> <p>It's important to preserve Claydol's health as much as possible, taking advantage of its resistances and immunities in order to spin multiple times throughout the game. Note that because Taunt + Toxic or Drill Peck Skarmory will eventually force Claydol out, one should not attempt to switch Claydol in on Skarmory to spin a single layer of Spikes, unless Skarmory runs Toxic + Protect and Claydol runs Refresh or Skarmory is seeded or burned. In circumstances where Skarmory will eventually force out Claydol, one should instead send it in only to spin away two or three layers of Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Claydol is featured as a spinner on stall teams that are frequently running the tried-and-true SkarmBliss defensive core; Claydol's Rock resistance is very helpful because it lets the team forgo Swampert as the default bulky Water-type, freeing up the slot for Milotic or Suicune. This setup of Claydol + Water-type is very sturdy against all sorts of mixed attackers and is still solid against all Dragon Dance Tyranitar variants. Most often these teams feature Tyranitar to set sand, although this compromises Suicune's and Milotic's bulk. On these stall teams Claydol really enjoys being paired with Dugtrio, as the combined effort of the two manages to take on even Hidden Power Bug versions of Dragon Dance Tyranitar more easily; Dugtrio is also important to trap and revenge kill Heracross, as Claydol stall teams tend to be very weak to it. Wish support from Blissey, Jirachi, or Vaporeon is greatly appreciated, as it allows Claydol to absorb more damage and survive longer throughout the game. Heal Bell support is also sometimes seen, allowing Claydol to ditch Refresh.</p> <p>Claydol is also featured on teams that are trying to set up a bulky sweeper that will cleave through the opposition with the right support. The most common bulky sweepers paired with Claydol are Curse Snorlax, Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, and Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi. All these threats like having Claydol as a partner because of their shared weakness to Spikes, which will slowly compromise their bulk and consequently their ability to sweep. On teams with Curse Snorlax, Claydol is always paired with Magneton, as the removal of Skarmory is necessary for Snorlax to sweep. The removal of Skarmory as a Spiker is also nice to make sure that Claydol can spin freely without fearing that Skarmory will set up Spikes again. Magneton also helps Claydol by trapping Forretress, which otherwise can be a real nuisance, especially if it's packing Hidden Power Bug. When Claydol is paired with Dugtrio, which can trap Tyranitar and Metagross, Curse Snorlax tends to run Shadow Ball as its coverage move; alternatively, when Claydol is paired with a Pursuit trapper to trap Gengar, Snorlax can ditch Shadow Ball in favor of Earthquake or Hidden Power Bug, and Claydol can spin more freely without the threat of Gengar spinblocking it. Besides spinning, Claydol provides a much-needed Rock-type resistance, as Magneton doesn't really count for this, and a Ground immunity, as most of its partners are grounded and vulnerable to Earthquake spam.</p> <p>Claydol teams supporting Calm Mind + Rest Suicune work very similarly; Claydol still enjoys being paired with Magneton, as Skarmory's phazing can be very annoying, but it also likes being paired with Dugtrio, as it allows Suicune to stay healthy for the end-game without having to take on Tyranitar and Metagross and helps deal with Celebi and Blissey so that Suicune is no longer walled. Claydol can also support Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi; this time it doesn't get paired with Magneton, as the team has enough special offense to take it on. Dugtrio, on the other hand, is a good partner, as Calm Mind + Wish Jirachi struggles against Tyranitar and Metagross. Alternatively, Skarmory can lay Spikes to help wear down Tyranitar and Metagross over the course of the game. When Claydol is supporting Curse Snorlax or Calm Mind + Rest Suicune, it doesn't generally pair with Tyranitar, as sand cancelling Leftovers of the bulky sweepers drastically reduces their longevity; for this reason, a weather-changing move is sometimes slotted on one of the team members—Rain Dance on Magneton, for example. Finally, it's worth noting that these archetypes tend to struggle against Cloyster, since it cannot be trapped by Magneton and threatens Claydol when it tries to spin.</p> <p>As far as offensive teams go, Claydol can sometimes fit on mixed offense, where it provides Rapid Spin support for its teammates and is chosen as a spinner over Starmie because of its strong Explosion and helpful Rock resistance. This archetype is often referred to as \"Skarm beatdown\" because it is trying to lure in Skarmory, bring it down with repeated chip damage, then spin away its remaining Spikes. Given the higher pace of play, Claydol tends to run a more offensive spread with more Speed EVs over bulk, with the intention of spinning only once throughout the game. Common partners in this archetype are mixed Metagross, mixed Salamence, Focus Punch Snorlax, offensive Celebi, Zapdos, offensive Suicune, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Here Claydol serves as a good defensive pivot with its Rock, Ground, and Electric resistances, as well as a wallbreaker with its powerful Explosion; this is very important because it allows Claydol to threaten common walls like Celebi, Blissey, and Milotic, which are all very difficult to deal otherwise. Since the roles of wallbreaker, defensive pivot, and spinner are all compressed into one, Claydol benefits greatly from Pursuit support, as it allows Claydol to perform its roles better in the face of a Gengar. Pursuit Metagross is a good option that puts Gengar in range of Claydol's Psychic while still having a good offensive presence compared to Pursuit Tyranitar.</p>"

Adding 4 EVs to HP on Salac Berry sets helps to activate the Salac Berry quicker and reduces its vulnerability to weak Quick Attacks. Knock Off and Rapid Spin can be used on Choice Band sets in place of Rock Blast or Double-Edge, providing more options for utility. Knock Off helps to remove Leftovers from physical walls such as Koffing and Wartortle that would frequently wall Anorith. Rapid Spin helps remove Spikes for offensive teams that are crippled by them. These options are unreliable, however, as Anorith will be locked into weak moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Wartortle avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band Anorith's Rock Slide, which can in response OHKO it with Surf in response. Wartortle is able to absorb several Rock Slides from Salac Berry Anorith and force it out. Koffing can switch into Brick Break and Hidden Power Bug freely and it can use Will-O-Wisp to neutralize Choice Band Anorith. Sludge Bomb and Flamethrower are able to break Anorith's Substitute and can status it if it choses to use Swords Dance without Substitute.

Brick Break complements Rock Slide by targetting the likes of Corsola, Magnemite, and Porygon super effectively. Alternatively, Hidden Power Bug secures an OHKO on the likes of physically defensive Lileep at +2 and physically defensive Mightyena at +3 after Intimidate. Substitute gives Anorith some form of protection from switch-ins and status, allowing it to set up freely while getting itself down to Salac Berry range. Anorith can scare off Pokemon such as Magnemite and Ariados through its attacking options, allowing it the free opportunity to use Substitute. Swords Dance allows Anorith to become a threatening cleaner. An Adamant nature allows Anorith to OHKO uninvested Seaking at +2. 76 Speed EVs allow Anorith to outspeed Pokemon such as Ponyta and Abra at +1, while the Special Defense EVs allow it to tank Quilava's Fire Blast and Abra's Psychic so it can set up.</p> <p>Salac Berry Anorith functions best on offensive teams that benefit from having a strong cleaner to support them. Pokemon such as Gloom, Flaaffy, and Castform that help spread status are appreciated, giving Anorith more windows of opportunity to set up and sweep. Various Choice Band users, such as Aipom, and other setup Pokemon, like Quilava and Cubone, can help dismantle certain defensive cores, which allows Anorith to have an easier time sweeping. Seaking can cover for the likes of Koffing thanks to its solid Special Attack allowing it to 2HKO Koffing with Surf and access to Water Veil. Castform offers mixed attacking coverage and status, weakening threats like Gloom and Koffing and allowing Anorith to come in and clean. Wartortle gives Anorith a hard time. To help with this, both Magnemite and Tentacool are immune to its Toxic, Magnemite can 2HKO Wartortle with Thunderbolt, and Tentacool can apply pressure to non-Refresh and Seismic Toss Wartortle with status and Substitute. Anorith provides an important resistance to Normal, which Flaaffy and Porygon appreciate. However, Anorith isn't bulky enough to switch into Normal-type wallbreakers such as Choice Band Aipom and Doduo long-term, so Pokemon such as physically defensive Gloom and faster threats like Ponyta can prevent these Pokemon from causing too much havoc.</p>"

Brick Break complements Rock Slide, as it allows Anorith to OHKO targets like Magnemite and Castform as well as 2HKO Rhyhorn. Hidden Power Bug uses Anorith's secondary STAB option to hit Drowzee and Mightyena harder. Rock Blast thwarts Substitute users such as Beedrill and Abra from setting up. Double-Edge deals slightly more damage compared to Rock Slide, with the drawback of recoil. This allows Double-Edge better odds of OHKOing Choice Band Seaking and Flaaffy.

Paralysis spreaders such as Porygon and Gloom immobilize faster Pokemon, enabling Anorith to more effectively eliminate them.

Physical walls such as Koffing and Wartortle are capable of absorbing a Rock Slide, allowing the opponent to capitalize on Choice-locked Anorith; special wallbreakers like Magnemite and Clamperl can break past them for Anorith. Specially offensive setup sweepers such as Abra and Smoochum appreciate Anorith being able to handle special walls such as Noctowl and Lileep. Physical setup sweepers such as Cubone and Swords Dance Gloom enjoy Anorith wallbreaking, making it easier for them to come in and clean the weakened team. Other physical wall breakers that provide mixed coverage, like Seaking and Castform, complement Anorith, as they are able to break through Koffing and Wartortle. Weather team struggle to answer specially defensive Pokemon such as Drowzee and Delcatty; Anorith can threaten both Pokemon out with reliable 2HKOs using Rock Slide.

Furthermore, if Dusclops runs more Special Defense investment, Armaldo can even Swords Dance on the switch, use Rock Slide as it is hit by Will-O-Wisp, and then KO Dusclops even with its reduced Attack, especially if given Spikes support. Earthquake is an alternative over Hidden Power Bug as it can hit Metagross and Tyranitar, and has good coverage alongside Armaldo's Rock STAB of choice.

It also boasts great utility in Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic to break down the opposing team. Shadow Ball is great neutral coverage thanks to the rarity of Dark-types. Hidden Power Fighting allows Shuppet to threaten Normal-types such as Castform and Aipom, which are immune to Shadow Ball, and Rock- and Steel-types like Lileep and Magnemite for a moderate amount of damage. Substitute allows Shuppet to take advantage of Choice-locked Normal-types such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow by easing prediction as it forces them out. For Shuppet's last moveslot, you have the choice of either Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp. Thunder Wave helps slow down fast Pokemon like Elekid and Aipom to support slow Pokemon like Croconaw and Cubone, and it also cripples defensive walls like Lileep and Dustox. Will-O-Wisp threatens physical attackers like Mankey, Pidgeotto, and Koffing on the switch in. Toxic cripples general defensive walls like Lileep and helps Shuppet break down the opposing team more easily.</p> <p>Shuppet can fit on offensive and balance structures alike because of its ability to disrupt teams and deal with Normal-types like Delcatty well.

Many special walls like Delcatty and Dustox also appreciate Shuppet's presence, as strong Normal-types like Aipom and Pidgeotto can break through them easily, so Shuppet's ability to dissuade them from using their Normal-type moves is valuable. Pairing Shuppet with Thunder Wave users such as Magnemite and other paralysis spreaders like Butterfree is also a great option to help circumvent Shuppet's low Speed while allowing it to fish for full paralysis with Substitute.</p>"

Hidden Power Flying also punishes Poison-types weak to Flying such as Gloom, Beedrill, and Ariados trying to take advantage of Tropius. Earthquake provides excellent coverage, threatening Pokemon that resist Hidden Power Flying such as Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Earthquake mitigates Tropius's vulnerability to Ponyta and Quilava, and it can let Tropius beat them or significantly weaken them in a pinch if it isn't OHKOed by Quilava's Charcoal-boosted Overheat. Leech Seed helps Tropius wear down foes, keep itself healthier, and punish Pokemon that might take advantage of its passivity, including Mightyena, Koffing, and Noctowl. Alternatively, Tropius can use Swords Dance to help it break past bulkier Pokemon such as Corsola, Gloom, and opposing Tropius. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 48 Atk / 128 Def / 84 Spe reliably avoids a 2HKO from Choice Band Aipom's Double-Edge while giving Tropius enough Speed to tie sun sweeper Gloom, outspeed base 95 Pokemon like Elekid in sun, and outspeed Adamant Rhyhorn with 252 Speed EVs. This spread also has enough Attack investment to KO Hasty Ponyta with Earthquake after Leech Seed damage.</p> <p>Physically defensive Tropius is a great addition to balance teams thanks to its reliability as a physical wall. Corsola is a standout partner for Tropius by absorbing Toxic and standing up to physical attackers like Doduo, Anorith, and Beedrill with super effective STAB attacks, while Tropius handles Meditite and takes Fighting-type coverage from Aipom for Corsola in return. Koffing can also absorb Toxic and mitigate Tropius's vulnerabilities to Poison-types like Swords Dance Gloom and Tentacool.

Curse can add some Defense to an Absol using Baton Pass or Taunt, as long as you give the final Baton Pass recipient a White Herb to negate the Speed drop. You might want to stick with Umbreon for Curse passing, however. Psych Up enables Absol to steal boosts from Curse Snorlax and Calm Mind Suicune; it can then proceed to either Taunt them or Baton Pass to another sweeper to take them out. Thief is a cool alternative and Perish Song a novel move, but they are generally overshadowed by Absol's other options. In UU, Absol can use Endure or Substitute and sweep with a Salac Berry boost, thanks to Swords Dance and its massive Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Nearly anything. Skarmory, Weezing, and Suicune might find it hard to phaze Absol out due to its access to Taunt and Thunderbolt, but it will be hard-pressed to do much to bulky offensive Pokemon. Metagross is a good example as Absol cannot hurt it outside of a Fire-type attack, while Metagross has STAB Meteor Mash to quickly defeat Absol. Similarly, Tyranitar can use Focus Punch or Rock Slide to pick off Absol. Choice Band Salamence can outspeed Absol and do a lot of damage to it with Hidden Power Flying, Earthquake, or even Brick Break.

Wynaut’s lower bulk allows it to punish weak hits harder than Wobbuffet, making it able to take down Latias and Latios. It is able to use Encore to lock a foe into an attack to ensure that it does not become setup fodder. However, Wynaut has a wide array of issues that come with using it on a team. Mainly, Wynaut is directly inferior to Wobbuffet, which can better fulfill the role of a trapper, due to its much better bulk allowing it to retaliate against stronger hits. Wynaut’s horrid bulk causes it to faint against many threats such as Groudon, Kyogre, Deoxys-A, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza. In addition to this, double trapper teams as a whole are niche. Because of this, along with its extremely passive nature, it is quite reliant on reads to make any notable impact within a match. Wynaut also faces the issue of not being able to hold Leftovers to soften up any blows that it takes. Overall, Wynaut is a terrible Pokemon, and should never be considered for use on a serious team.</p>",

Encore allows Wynaut to thwart many sweepers by locking them into an attacking move, allowing for Wynaut to take them down with either Counter or Mirror Coat. Since Wynaut has poor bulk, Destiny Bond is decently capable of bringing something down with it. Safeguard is a somewhat niche option but can be a beneficial one since it prevents the status that cripples Wynaut so heavily.

Ice Beam is a great STAB option that also threatens common Pokemon such as Pidgeotto and Lileep. Hidden Power Grass allows Snorunt to threaten the most prominent spinner in the tier, Staryu, alongside other Water-types such as Chinchou and Seaking. Finally, Endure allows Snorunt to activate its Salac Berry and outspeed every unboosted Pokemon bar Voltorb, meaning it will always be able to get a layer of spikes versus Pokemon without priority or a status move.</p> <p>Snorunt fits best on offensive and balance teams that benefit from Spikes support.

These partners and other offensive threats enjoy Spikes chipping down Pokemon that are otherwise tough matchups for them, such as Delcatty, Lileep, and Dustox, allowing them to wallbreak much more easily. Snorunt also appreciates pivots such as Aipom, Delcatty, and Lileep to help it set up spikes later if it faces an unfavourable lead matchup. Additionally, the former two are great checks to Spoink, another tough lead matchup for Snorunt due to its fast Taunt. Lileep can also deal with common priority users such as Pidgeotto and Taillow, which completely shut down Snorunt with a Salac Berry boost, and it checks Fire-types such as Growlithe and Cyndaquil that threaten Snorunt. As teammates, priority users enjoy Spikes chipping down faster Pokemon such as Elekid into range of a KO. Even defensive pokemon enjoy Spikes which helps them threaten offensive Pokemon such as tank Castform. Shuppet uniquely denies Rapid Spin users such as Staryu, and it takes advantage of the Spikes on Delcatty and Pokemon locked into Normal- or Fighting type moves. Lastly, Magnemite walls Snorunt, so Nosepass can be used trap and remove it, while at the same time also handling priority move users and Fire-types like Lileep can. However, Nosepass does not have the longevity to do this repeatedly throughout a game.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Glalie has a niche in the UU metagame as a Spikes lead on hyper offense teams and as a rare mid-game Spiker with Explosion on bulky offense teams. Although it faces direct competition from prominent Spikers Omastar and Qwilfish, Glalie's niche comes from its pure Ice typing giving it a defensive edge against Electric- and Ground-type attacks from offensive Normal- and Electric-types. Glalie has positive matchups against both other Spikers and Rapid Spinners, giving it good self-sufficiency for winning Spikes wars. Many of Glalie's offensive teammates appreciate the momentum that Glalie provides with the combination of Spikes and Explosion, making it a good Spiker on teams that prefer Glalie's defensive typing. However, Glalie isn't infallible, as any team with an Arcanine can quickly reverse the momentum it generates. This is what separates Glalie from Qwilfish, whose Water typing allows it to resist Arcanine's Fire Blast to safely lay down Spikes while also providing reliable speed control for its team with Thunder Wave, leaving Qwilfish as the preferred hyper offense lead in the modern metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glalie can be used as a mid-game Spiker with a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 236 SpD / 20 Spe and a Careful nature to better switch into Water- and Electric-types. Taunt can be used over Hidden Power Grass to prevent slower foes from using Toxic to put Glalie on a timer, Kangaskhan from using Wish or Rest, or slower Spikers like Omastar from setting up. Ice Beam gives Glalie a STAB option that prevents Flying-type setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther and Gligar from turning Glalie into setup fodder without resorting to Explosion. Icy Wind is a speed control tool to prevent Taunt users from denying Spikes or to lay more layers of Spikes against Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Electabuzz, though Qwilfish is better at speed control through Thunder Wave paralysis. Light Screen allows Glalie to survive special attacks more comfortably and set up on Omastar, Tentacruel, and Ampharos, and it can keep it active for a teammate after using Explosion. Lum Berry gives Glalie a safety net against Toxic and paralysis to let it lay more layers of Spikes without being put on a timer or losing its Speed for a fast Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine hard stops Glalie from applying pressure, as it is faster than max Speed Glalie and OHKOes it with Fire Blast. Lead Arcanine can deny Glalie the opportunity to lay Spikes and pressure common switch-ins with Thief if Glalie switches out, while any non-lead Arcanine can limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes before exerting its own offense. If Glalie preemptively uses Explosion turn 1 on the Arcanine switch, this means Glalie has not laid down any Spikes, and Explosion can not OHKO Arcanine after Intimidate, keeping Arcanine healthy to receive Wish passes from Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Solrock</strong>: Solrock's Rock Slide puts a dent into Glalie; Choice Band Solrock can OHKO it, while other variants usually 2HKO it. It is also Spikes-immune, resistant to Explosion, and not easily pressured by Glalie's coverage. Solrock can even safely set up Reflect or Light Screen against non-Taunt Glalie to enable certain setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hitmontop is a spinner Glalie has trouble against, as Brick Break puts the fear of a 2HKO into Glalie, while Rapid Spin removes its Spikes. Glalie can explode on Hitmontop after it has laid Spikes, but Intimidate means it will not OHKO, leaving Glalie to need prior chip damage or a revenge killer for Hitmontop. Hitmonlee is an anti-Spikes lead that can OHKO Glalie with Choice Band Brick Break, or use Bulk Up on its Spikes turn or switch-out turns.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter makes for a good anti-Spikes lead, as it can Taunt any attempts to lay Spikes and has an immunity to Explosion, leaving Glalie no other option than to switch out, or use the uncommon Ice Beam. Haunter thus makes its own progress by spreading Will-O-Wisps, Thieving any Leftovers, or using Substitute to push itself into Salac/Petaya Berry range and scout the switch-in.</p>",

Explosion also comes in handy for removing slower setup sweepers such as Granbull, Slowking, and Curse Muk, which can otherwise outlast teams with great bulk and Rest. Earthquake puts pressure on Poison-types like Qwilfish and Tentacruel, taxing either of them for using Spikes or Rapid Spin, respectively, and allows Glalie to hit Electric-types without resorting to Explosion, breaking Electrode and Manectric's Substitutes to keep them from possibly taking advantage of Glalie.

A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe with an Impish nature allows Glalie to more effectively set up Spikes against Normal-types, as it can dodge a 2HKO from offensive Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Bulk Up Granbull's unboosted Return, and an OHKO from Choice Band Granbull's Double-Edge. It also narrowly dodges an OHKO from non-Choice Band Kangaskhan and Granbull's Focus Punch while it sets up Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Electric-types like Electrode, Manectric, and Electabuzz like Glalie as a teammate, for all their checks take Spikes damage, and they appreciate Glalie's ability to safely set up and use Explosion on Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn.

They can force switches against positive matchups by taking advantage of Psychic's Special Defense drops and few notable resistances to set up a Substitute or Calm Mind. Arcanine likes Glalie as a partner both because it likes Spikes to help it break through specially bulky walls, and Glalie can wear down Tentacruel with Earthquake as well as using Explosion on other bulky Water-types such as Walrein, Blastoise, Lanturn, and Slowking.

Late-game cleaners such as Scyther, Gorebyss, and Rain Dance Omastar are good Spikes partners, appreciating the extra push of Spikes damage to KO bulkier targets.</p>"

What makes Glalie such a good lead is its combination of high Speed, ability to go physically or specially offensive, and access to said Spikes as well as Explosion. Explosion gives Glalie a ton of offensive presence and is a great tool for granting it momentum by allowing it to choose when to go out after Spikes are set. Unfortunately, Glalie is almost impossible to switch in safely due to its poor defensive typing, and its movepool is pretty shallow, giving it little utility outside of the lead teamslot.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially offensive Spiker set is definitely viable, but strictly outclassed by both the bulky and physically offensive sets due to weaker overall coverage, despite making the most of Glalie's STAB Ice Beam.

Light Screen is available to support the team before going down, but most teams would rather make use of the hole provided by Explosion. Rain Dance is an option that can allow Glalie to set up Spikes and rain, then Explode to give a free switch to a sweeper like Huntail. Finally, Sing is risky but available to cripple the foe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Glalie is typically seen as a lead, the best way to limit its effectiveness is to be as prepared for it in the lead slot as possible. Magby and Ponyta are probably the best anti-leads available in the metagame, as they easily outspeed Glalie and OHKO it with Overheat before it can even move. Charmeleon and Quilava are decent alternatives but can only Speed tie it. Vigoroth and opposing Glalie can prevent Glalie from setting up Spikes with Taunt. Venomoth can easily outspeed Glalie and put it to sleep with Sleep Powder, totally crippling it unless it runs Lum Berry or Sleep Talk. A lead Hitmonchan can threaten an immediate KO with Sky Uppercut and spin away the Spikes Glalie might set up, but it's slower than Glalie and therefore susceptible to Explosion. Other effective anti-leads that can normally limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes includes Torkoal, Flareon, and Rock- and Steel-types.</p> <p>Outside of the lead metagame, Mawile is probably the best initial switch-in to Glalie because it has Intimidate to lessen the blow from Earthquake, resists Explosion and Ice Beam, and can eliminate Glalie with Hidden Power Steel or Focus Punch. However, it's slow and will allow Glalie to get at a minimum of two layers of Spikes if it switches in on turn one. Ghost-types like Haunter, Shedinja, and Sableye are completely immune to Explosion, and Shedinja is immune to Ice Beam as well, though KOed by Spikes. Lairon is essentially immune to Explosion and resists Ice Beam, though it's really weak to Earthquake. Other Rock-types, particularly Sudowoodo and Relicanth, can easily KO Glalie with Rock Slide and resist Explosion with the latter also resisting Ice Beam.</p>",

The bulk from the HP investment gives Glalie some survivability against non-super effective STAB moves like Kecleon's Return and opposing Glalie attacks not named Explosion. Taunt prevents other Glalie from setting up Spikes for two turns, assuming your Glalie wins the Speed tie. Alternatively, Sleep Talk can prevent Glalie from being completely crippled by sleep leads, such as Venomoth. Ice Beam destroys Grass- and Ground-types that may be leading for the opponent, though they're rare sights. It also deals a ton of damage to Pokemon looking to absorb Explosion, particularly Haunter and Rock-types like Graveler. Explosion allows Glalie to take out or leave a hole in the opponent's lead and limits the number of Spikes layers their Glalie can set up. Explosion is also Glalie's best tool against a few common switch-ins like Flareon and Hitmonchan, the latter of which will be looking to spin away Glalie's Spikes.</p> <p>Naive is the chosen nature to make sure Explosion and Ice Beam are as strong as possible. A Hasty nature is an option as well, and both have the same general level of effectiveness in the long run. Max Speed is needed to Speed tie with other Glalie as well as Charmeleon, an admittedly uncommon anti-lead. Lum Berry is an alternative item choice to Leftovers that can prevent Venomoth from totally crippling Glalie on turn one and guaranteeing Glalie to get at least one layer of Spikes against it. Hidden Power Grass can be used in the second moveslot to eliminate Relicanth and other Rock-types looking to absorb Explosion. In the same vein, Hidden Power Water hits Rock- and Fire-types for a decent amount of damage, both of which are otherwise capable anti-leads to Glalie. Finally, Hidden Power Psychic deals a high amount of damage to Hitmonchan and Haunter, but Ice Beam deals a fair amount already.</p> <p>Nearly every team benefits from having a Spiker in some way, and this set is the most reliable way of getting at least one layer up early in the match. Unfortunately, Glalie doesn't really provide any type of synergy and should probably be used in the lead slot only. This set works best on more offensive teams due to the fact that Glalie likely isn't going to last throughout the match and will be KOed in the lead slot, meaning it's not going to be coming in later in the match to set up Spikes again if they get spun away. Teams that have a lot of fast, strong attackers like Murkrow, Raticate, and Plusle will make the best use of having Glalie on their team.</p> <p>Explosion is ideally Glalie's mode of leaving the match, and there are a few Pokemon that can tank it pretty well, particularly Rock-, Ghost-, and Steel-types like Relicanth, Sableye, and Mawile. However, it will leave a sizable dent in nearly everything that is not a Ghost-type or Lairon, meaning Pokemon that can take advantage of the hole it leaves and force them out are the best teammates. Hitmonchan, Vigoroth, and Arbok are all offensive Pokemon that can sweep with the opponent's physical wall heavily damaged. Finally, if the opponent leads with a Pokemon weak to Ice Beam, they'll likely switch to a Fire- or Water-type to tank the attack. Pokemon that can switch into them to preserve Glalie for later in the match make good teammates as well; Kecleon and Pelipper are good examples that can switch into either one.</p>"

        "Physical Spikes": {
          "description": "<p>This is probably the best offensive approach to Glalie, allowing it to deal as much damage as possible while still setting up Spikes efficiently. Earthquake deals a ton of damage to common Glalie switch-ins, particularly Rock- and Steel-types like Lairon, Metang, and Sudowoodo looking to absorb Explosion or Ice Beam, as well as Fire-types like Magcargo and Flareon. Shadow Ball takes out the likes of Haunter, Chimecho, and Shedinja, which otherwise can easily switch in on Earthquake or Explosion. Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock makes sure Pidgeot and Murkrow can't switch in easily on Earthquake and takes them out without having to resort to Explosion, and it still does a decent amount to Haunter and takes out Shedinja. Finally, Explosion gets Glalie out of the way and deals an insane amount of damage with max Attack, letting it leave a dent in even physical stalwarts like Relicanth.</p> <p>Leftovers allows Glalie to both set up Spikes and attack with the appropriate move when it needs to, but Glalie gains a ton of power with Choice Band. Getting locked into Spikes with Choice Band isn't a huge detriment, either, considering setting up Spikes is its primary role on the team.</p> <p>This set is best fit on heavy offense teams that want Glalie to set Spikes but also have the ability to punch holes in the opposing team from turn 1. This set is a good lure for weakening or removing the Rock-types that are likely to switch into Glalie to absorb Explosion, which can allow for an easier sweep by your Normal- or Flying-types later in the match. With a Choice Band, Glalie even easily 2HKOes 252 HP Relicanth with Earthquake.

      "overview": "<p>Walrein distinguishes itself as a Water-type with a balance of bulk and offensive presence that allows it to serve as a check to threats such as Scyther, Gligar, Omastar, Arcanine, and Nidoqueen. Its secondary Ice typing gives it an offensive edge over other Water-types such as Blastoise, as it offers Walrein an Ice Beam that threatens Vileplume and Cradily while scoring notable KOs on important targets such as Scyther. Moreover, unlike its main competitor Lapras, Walrein retains a key resistance to Fire- thanks to its ability Thick Fat, making it more reliable against Arcanine.</p> <p>In spite of these attributes, Walrein faces stiff competition from other Water-types that offer appealing utility in the form of Rapid Spin or Heal Bell such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and most importantly Lapras, which on top of not being as susceptible to Toxic also tends to be more immediately threatening thanks to its access to Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt. Moreover, while Walrein is not a slouch offensively, it fails to effectively threaten some of the bulkiest Pokemon around, such as Kangaskhan and the aforementioned Lapras.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar is an alternative to Encore to phaze setup Pokemon and scout the opposing team while possibly racking Spikes damage. Protect lets Walrein get its health back from Leftovers safely and is quite effective alongside Toxic in addition to letting Walrein scout Explosion and what moves Choice Band users such as Solrock lock themselves into. Walrein can also choose to forego offensive investment and spend all of its EVs into bulk to be even more safe against the likes of Gligar, although it misses some important OHKOs against the Pokemon it is supposed to keep in check such as Arcanine and Scyther on top of being easier to switch into. Curse Walrein can consider Hidden Power Ghost to hit Misdreavus, Solrock, and Lunatone super effectively, but Ice Beam provides more important coverage overall. Substitute can be used alongside Encore, as Walrein can get some free turns by locking the opposing Pokemon into a move ineffective against Substitute such as Toxic, or get a free Substitute after locking an opposing Pokemon into an undesirable move with Encore. Rest can also be considered on non-Curse sets to provide Walrein some longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Walrein usually fails to outdamage Kangaskhan's Rest loop and can get poisoned or slowly worn down as a result. The only thing Kangaskhan has to worry about from standard Walrein is Encore, which can lock it into an inconvenient move. On the other hand, Curse Walrein has a better shot at eventually breaking through Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: By virtue of its typing, Lanturn can switch into Walrein without much trouble and threaten it with Thunderbolt, but it has to watch out for Toxic, Earthquake, and Hidden Power Grass. Ampharos has enough special bulk to withstand several Ice Beams while doing a large amount of damage with Thunderbolt and bypassing Toxic with Heal Bell, but it has to respect repeated hits from Walrein's STAB moves. Other Electric-types such as Electabuzz, Manectric, Electrode, and Raichu also threaten Walrein but have more trouble switching into its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Bad poison outweighs Leftovers recovery and heavily hampers Walrein's durability as a result, especially if it lacks Rest. Spikes are also very troublesome, as they limit Walrein's ability to switch into the threats it's supposed to keep in check such as Scyther, Gligar, and Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Lapras fears virtually nothing from non-Hidden Power Walrein, as it can shrug off Toxic with Heal Bell and threaten Walrein with Thunderbolt, although it fails to 3HKO Curse Walrein. The same applies to opposing Walrein if Walrein lacks Toxic or Hidden Power Grass. Curse Lapras, Curse Walrein, and Calm Mind Slowking can also use Walrein lacking Encore or Roar as setup fodder. If Walrein lacks Earthquake or Hidden Power Electric, then it is powerless against Tentacruel and Spikes fodder for Qwilfish. Feraligatr is more susceptible to Toxic and Hidden Power but can otherwise set up with Swords Dance on Walrein and threaten it with a boosted Rock Slide. Phazers such as Roar Lapras, Roar Blastoise, and Encore Walrein are also suited to prevent Curse Walrein from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although they would prefer not directly switching into Walrein, Hitmonlee and Hitmontop have enough bulk to stomach a hit and pressure Walrein with their super effective STAB moves. On the rarer side, Poliwrath resists Walrein's STAB combination and can hide behind a Substitute and threaten either to set up with Bulk Up or Belly Drum or to fire off a powerful Focus Punch, as long as it doesn't get forced out by Encore, Roar, or a super effective Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Without Encore, Walrein can be exploited by Calm Mind users such as Grumpig and Golduck, both of which can also dodge Toxic with Substitute and boost their Special Defense to prevent Walrein from breaking the Substitute with its STAB moves. However, Earthquake can break their Substitute regardless of Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: With a bit of chip damage, Walrein can be revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Choice Band Solrock, Nidoqueen, and Haunter, but none of these want to fight Walrein from full health unless Walrein is asleep.</p>",

        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its bulk, coverage, and STAB combination, Walrein is a very resilient Pokemon in a lot of one-on-one matchups. Ice Beam threatens Flying-, Grass-, and Ground-types such as Scyther, Gligar, Cradily, Vileplume, and Nidoqueen. Earthquake effectively threatens Lanturn as well as Poison-types such as Tentacruel and Qwilfish, all of which could take advantage of Walrein otherwise. Surf threatens Arcanine with a potential OHKO, making Walrein a more reliable answer to that threat. Surf also covers Rock-types such as Solrock, Lunatone, and Aggron while hitting Glalie fairly hard, preventing it from getting Spikes too easily on Walrein. Surf also can be used to save Ice Beam PP in long battles. Hidden Power Grass is another method to damage Water-types, most notably threatening Omastar with a potential OHKO to prevent it from getting Spikes on the field. Hidden Power Electric is also an option if Walrein doesn't pack Earthquake, as unlike Hidden Power Grass, it retains a super effective hit on Tentacruel and Qwilfish. Toxic pressures Pokemon that Walrein cannot effectively break through such as Kangaskhan, Hypno, and other Water-types such as Lapras, Blastoise, Feraligatr, and opposing Walrein. Alternatively, Encore can allow Walrein to check some setup sweepers such as Curse Lapras and Calm Mind Slowking. It can also be used to lock some of Walrein's usual answers such as Kangaskhan and Lapras into undesirable moves, thus creating opportunities for Walrein's teammates.</p> <p>The given EV spread ensures that Walrein can avoid 2HKOs from Hidden Power Grass from Arcanine as well as Double-Edge from Choice Band Scyther after one layer of Spikes. The rest is spent into Special Attack to allow Walrein to hit as hard as possible, enough to ensure OHKOs on Scyther and Solrock with Ice Beam and Surf, respectively. More EVs in Special Attack can be considered to hit other notable benchmarks; 212 Special Attack EVs guarantees that Surf will OHKO Arcanine without any defensive investment, and it is more than enough to OHKO standard defensive Omastar with Hidden Power Grass. 44 EVs can be spent in Speed to outrun uninvested Solrock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Walrein does a decent job at handling Scyther, it struggles to switch in repeatedly on Choice Band variants and therefore appreciates backups to play around its usual attacks. In this regard, Omastar and Arcanine are good teammates; the former brings Spikes, while the latter offers a priority move to deal with Reversal variants of Scyther. Walrein is commonly forced out by Electric-types such as Ampharos and Lanturn. Therefore, specially bulky or Electric-resistant Pokemon suited to deal with these threats such as Kangaskhan, Vileplume, and Cradily are welcome additions to teams featuring Walrein. Walrein is also quite susceptible to residual damage in the forms of Spikes and Toxic. As a result, Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel and Hitmontop as well as clerics such as Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria are partners of choice. Finally, Walrein struggles against Pokemon that can take its hits comfortably while circumventing Toxic, which notably includes Rest users such as Kangaskhan and Slowking as well as Lapras. Thus, it is a good idea to pack offensive threats that can take advantage of most of these Pokemon once they are asleep or using Heal Bell. Focus Punch Kangaskhan, Swords Dance Scyther, Electabuzz, and Focus Punch Ampharos are good candidates to accomplish this task.</p>"

        "Curse": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With this set, Walrein can turn into a potent wincon that can defeat some of its usual checks. Although it heavily competes with Lapras due to the latter's greater special bulk and access to Shell Armor, Curse Walrein retains some merits to warrant consideration, most notably Earthquake, which makes Walrein much more immediately threatening to Electric-types that would be used to force Walrein out. Ice Beam may seem like an odd choice for a physically oriented sweeper, but it complements Earthquake nicely by hitting Flying-types such as Scyther, Gligar, Altaria, and Xatu without any prior boosts. It also dents Vileplume, which otherwise can be extremely problematic to this variant of Walrein due to Leech Seed and Hidden Power Grass. Rest is mandatory to keep Walrein healthy and cure it from status afflictions.</p> <p>The EV spread and Sassy nature aim to make Walrein as specially bulky as possible to make it harder to break through both specially and physically after Curse boosts. Walrein usually wants at least 236 EVs in Special Defense to ensure that Modest Lapras's Thunderbolt will never 3HKO without factoring critical hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>One of the most direct ways to prevent Curse Walrein from sweeping is to force it to use Rest before attacking it with Electric-type attacks from the likes of Ampharos and Lanturn. Thus, specially bulky Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Vileplume, and Cradily that are suited to handle Electric-types make for solid teammates. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Solrock and Hitmonlee are also able to threaten Walrein with a 2HKO even after a Curse boost, which makes physically defensive backups such as Nidoqueen, Gligar, and Vileplume good backbones. Other setup sweepers such as Lunatone and Swords Dance Feraligatr may be tempted to set up alongside Walrein and break through it. Therefore, it is a good idea to pack checks to these problematic Pokemon such as Roar Blastoise. There may be scenarios where Walrein is forced out after using Rest, so clerics such as Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria make for useful backups to spare Walrein from having to burn sleep turns by itself. Finally, Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop can clear the field of Spikes, easing Walrein's attempts to set up in front of Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Scyther, and Gligar.</p>"

Surf OHKOes or 2HKOes the vast majority of the tier with the exception of Water-resistant Pokemon. Ice Beam threatens Grass-types with an OHKO in the case of physically defensive Gloom and Tropius while also OHKOing specially defensive Gloom after Surf. Hidden Power Grass threatens Water-types such as Seaking, Chinchou, and Corsola, OHKOing the latter after a Calm Mind boost. Substitute is a great option to punish switching around Clamperl, but Protect can also be used to scout Choice-locked revenge killers. The first EV spread is seen on offensively inclined teams to help Clamperl survive and trade with Pokemon such as Aipom with enough Speed investment to outspeed defensive Gloom. Modest is the preferred nature on this spread, as Timid does not reach any notable speed benchmarks. The alternate EV spread can be used more commonly on balance teams with a Timid nature to improve matchup against Pokemon such as Adamant Cubone and opposing Clamperl.</p> <p>Clamperl fits both on offensive and defensive teams as a wallbreaker. It is especially good at enabling Anorith and Beedrill, with its main targets of entry being Koffing and Corsola, which both teammates can struggle versus. Pokemon like Quilava and Ponyta also appreciate Clamperl trading with Water-types and checking Pokemon such as opposing Ponyta. Clamperl appreciates Pokemon that are able to pivot it in. Ariados and Aipom with Baton Pass can allow it to come in on Koffing or Corsola a lot easier to threaten the opposing team. Wailmer and Voltorb can be good partners, as they can use Explosion on Water- or Grass-types such as Seaking or Gloom while additionally giving Clamperl entry to continue wallbreaking. Notable defensive partners for Clamperl include Flaaffy, Gloom, and Sunflora, with all resisting Electric-type moves that threaten Clamperl while additionally providing offensive pressure against Water-type Pokemon.</p>"

Then you have some options, you can give it Defense, take a Dragon Danced Salamence Hidden Power Flying (or one of a Choice Banded one that switches in to take your Surf and ruin Clamperl and the rest of your team) and Ice Beam its face back, go with Special Defense and spam \"jajaja\" when Omastar attempts to HP Electric/Grass you and it fails to OHKO, or you can give it Speed to outspeed something like the Regi Trio and Swampert. On the second, max HP and Special Defense with a Bold nature would do fine.</p> <h3>Opinion</h3> <p>Leave the clams alone, or even, feed it to your Grumpig or something, maybe it'll decide to grow another pearl and double its Special Attack, now THAT would be cool. But Clamperl is still pretty cool, if you're looking for a change on your UU team, go for it. 540 Special Attack is nothing to mess with, and UUs don't have good Defenses to begin with. Beware, though, UU metagame is all about offense, so don't get your clam get killed in the process.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Blissey, Snorlax, Lapras and Lanturn are the obvious ones. Other than that, you need to predict and switch something that can KO it. And nearly everything can KO it, as it's really slow and has no Leftovers recovery, so what it takes, it keeps. It can't switch in anything, as well.</p>",

If you're not good at predicting, Substitute will help a little, emphasis on a little considering Clamperl's HP and lack of Leftovers recovery.

      "overview": "<p>Huntail behaves on the battlefield as it does in nature: lurking in the depths, ready to pounce at a moment's notice and decimate its prey. Huntail is the best single-turn setup sweeper available in NU, almost literally turning the tide of battle as soon as it makes its appearance. With just rain active, Huntail easily outspeeds and OHKOes or 2HKOes a huge portion of the NU tier thanks to the combination of Swift Swim and rain-boosted Hydro Pump, making it a threat you absolutely must have an answer for. As if its STAB attacks were not scary enough, it also boasts great coverage, making it incredibly hard to outright wall and unpleasant to play around. Make no mistake; misstep around Huntail, and the battle is lost.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite boasting one of the most dangerous sets in NU, Huntail really can't do much more than what's been listed. While its Attack is actually higher than its Special Attack, it doesn't have any notable moves nor STAB to make use of it apart from Double-Edge and Hidden Power, although it does get Screech to add some oomph to its attacks. Crunch is an alternate coverage option available to Huntail, but is really only useful for Chimecho, and Huntail's STAB attacks do more to Chimecho than Crunch does with rain active. Blizzard is an option over Ice Beam to threaten Bellossom a bit more, but its accuracy sucks. Refresh can protect Huntail from Thunder Wave from the likes of Octillery and Kecleon, as well as other status, but is hard to fit on its sets. Finally, Toxic is an option to whittle down Dewgong and Bellossom if they lack Rest, which may be more helpful in the long run than Huntail's other attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>By avoiding the 3HKO from Hidden Power Grass and being able to heal off any damage done to it, RestTalk Dewgong is about the only true counter to Huntail available in the tier. The next best answer is specially defensive Bellossom, particularly those that carry Sunny Day, but they will still take a number from Ice Beam. Castform gets a special mention here as being a solid offensive check, although it is still 2HKOed by a Mystic Water- and rain-boosted Hydro Pump while only being able to 2HKO back with Thunderbolt (it does get the OHKO with a Modest Thunder, however). RestTalk Wailord with Roar is a great answer to Huntail, as it too can heal off the damage from Hidden Power Grass and use Roar to disrupt Huntail's rain turns. Lickitung, Kecleon, and Wigglytuff are good checks to Huntail if they can nail it with Toxic as it uses Rain Dance, and proceed to stall out its rain turns with Wish and Protect or Rest. Roselia just barely avoids the 2HKO from Ice Beam if it switches into it, and can proceed to use Giga Drain to deal huge damage to Huntail or paralyze it with Stun Spore. Outside of rain, Huntail is rather easy to revenge kill with fast Pokemon that have powerful Electric- or Grass-type attacks like Plusle, Haunter, and Grovyle.</p>",

        "Swift Swim Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>Not only is this set super dangerous, it's also super easy to play with if you're good at making use of the limited rain turns. Simply get Huntail in, set up Rain Dance, and proceed to use Hydro Pump until you win. Ice Beam is there to keep Roselia and other Grass-types from effectively countering Huntail. The last moveslot is dedicated to dealing as much damage as possible to the tier's other Water-types. Hidden Power Grass is nice to get the OHKO on Relicanth and Whiscash, while Hidden Power Electric decimates Pelipper.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforwardly offensive to make Huntail as strong and fast as possible, with maximum Speed being needed to ensure Huntail at least Speed ties with other Huntail and outspeeds base 50 Speed Pokemon outside of rain. A bulkier EV spread of 152 HP / 252 SpA / 104 Spe is certainly doable if you are unconcerned about tying with other Huntail, giving Huntail some cushion against priority attacks and weaker attacks from its counters like Dewgong. The 104 Spe EVs are kept to hit 166 Speed, which doubles to 332 in the rain, just enough to outpace +1 Pupitar. Running the above spread with a Modest nature is also an option, which will notably ensure the 2HKO against Roselia with Ice Beam. Finally, Mystic Water is an option to give Huntail's Water-type STAB attack a bit more punch, in particular opening up a guaranteed OHKO on 252 HP Chimecho with Hydro Pump and a 2HKO on maximum Special Defense Lickitung with Surf.</p> <p>The last moveslot can be replaced if you are confident in your ability to remove Huntail's checks and counters before bringing it out. Baton Pass is the most immediate replacement option, as it gives Huntail a fantastic way out of the battlefield and keeps momentum on your team's side. Substitute can be used to protect Huntail from status from the likes of Lickitung, Togetic, and Wailord. Finally, Toxic is an option to counteract Dewgong lacking Rest as a reliable long-term answer to Huntail.</p> <p>Huntail is a pretty self-sufficient late-game sweeper, although there are a couple Pokemon that need to be weakened or removed before it can consider a sweep. Specially defensive Dewgong is the most pressing concern, as it is only 4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass and can easily remove the damage with Rest and attack in kind with its own Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive Bellossom is the other major barrier to a successful Huntail sweep, as it is only 3HKOed by Ice Beam and can regain its health with Giga Drain and Synthesis. As both of these answers, as well as most of the other Pokemon that can tank a Hydro Pump, are grounded, Spikes support is the best way to initiate a Huntail sweep. This makes Cacturne and Roselia good teammates, and both can switch into the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that are sure to be aimed at Huntail. A strong, physically attacking teammate can remove most of the Pokemon that can reliably answer Huntail, making Hitmonchan a good offensive partner. Plusle makes a fantastic offensive teammate as well, as it can remove Dewgong from the picture and weaken the other specially defensive Pokemon on your opponent's team enough for Huntail to sweep. As a bonus, Plusle gets Rain Dance and Thunder, making it a good dedicated rain setter teammate as well. Pairing Huntail with a lure like Seadra is also an option, as it can force the opponent to reveal their Water-type answer and weaken it, allowing you to best prepare for a Huntail sweep later in the game.</p>"

        "Baton Pass": {
          "description": "<p>While Huntail's main role and presence in NU is as a rain sweeper, it also has a function as a member of Baton Pass chains. Its main role on chains is as an anti-lead; after a Barrier boost, Glalie's Explosion is only doing a maximum of 54% to Huntail. On top of this, Huntail easily OHKOes the common Fire-type leads of the tier with Hydro Pump and isn't threatened by Hitmonchan after a Barrier boost either. This allows it to start the Baton Pass chain on the right foot and get the Defense boost its teammates will need to continue the chain. While Huntail doesn't offer anything else to pass (no Aqua Ring or Agility in ADV), it does offer a large offensive presence and can make use of the Special Attack boosts that are going to be accumulated on the rest of the chain.</p> <p>Maximum Speed and HP EVs are run to give Huntail as much speed and bulk as possible to start the chain off on the right foot. Lum Berry is a recommended option if using Huntail in the lead slot to make sure it can avoid status from leads like Octillery, Venomoth, and Torkoal. Otherwise, Leftovers is preferred to make the most of Huntail's bulk and give it some longevity to switch into Spikes repeatedly if needed.</p> <p>While this set can be run off of Baton Pass chains and used as simply a bulky attacker outside of rain, Seadra typically does the part better thanks to its higher Speed. That said, most players will assume an attempt at a rain sweep as soon as Huntail's presence is known, allowing this set to function more as an offensive pivot and play around your opponent's assumptions. Baton Pass also gives Huntail a bit more momentum than Seadra does, and passing a Substitute to a teammate like Bulk Up Hitmonchan can be game-changing. If using this set that way, it's recommended to replace Barrier with Ice Beam to give Huntail a bit more coverage.</p>"

Thanks to these factors, Relicanth can take on an offensive or defensive role for your team, making it easy to fit on teams looking for a good Normal and Flying check. However, its really common weaknesses, particularly its weakness to Fighting, are awful, and while it's a physically defensive behemoth, its Special Defense is pretty lacking. That said, you really can't go wrong with including Relicanth on your team; just keep an eye out for errant Grass-type attacks.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Relicanth's movepool is surprisingly large for a fish Pokemon, but the most effective sets have been listed above. Of the sets not listed, a Substitute + 3 attacks set is probably the most effective, with Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Double-Edge having sufficient coverage and Rock Head preventing recoil giving Relicanth a nice niche over similar users of the set like Pidgeot. A status platform set focusing on the various status moves Relicanth has like Toxic, Body Slam, and Yawn can be a fun gimmick to disrupt the opponent's team with, but going that route sacrifices Relicanth's overall effectiveness and longevity. Relicanth's immense physical bulk means a Swagger + Psych Up set is possible, although Relicanth is a bit too specially frail to really make use of it, as Relicanth's main revenge killers hit it specially, meaning it won't be able to risk staying in to get the Psych Up boost.</p> <p>Hidden Power Flying wasn't specifically mentioned before, but it gives Relicanth a move for both Grass-types and Hitmonchan in one moveslot. Relicanth is probably the best user of Rock Tomb in the tier and it gets STAB on the move, although Rock Slide's extra power is usually going to be more appreciated. Hydro Pump can make a decent last move to give Relicanth the jump on Mawile and Metang among other physically bulky Pokemon, but the needed Special Attack EVs to make it worth it are too costly in the long run. Finally, Blizzard is Relicanth's best option for Tangela and will completely throttle it, but its accuracy and the fact that defensive Tangela isn't super common mean it'll be a dead moveslot way more often than not.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Defensive Grass-types are the absolute best answers to any Relicanth set, with Tangela and Bellossom only really fearing Toxic and easily OHKOing back with their STAB moves. Roselia is even immune to Toxic, but it takes quite a bit more from Rock Slide. Hitmonchan resists Rock Slide and will leave a large dent in Relicanth with Sky Uppercut. If Relicanth lacks Toxic, it becomes huge setup bait for Bulk Up Hitmonchan. Plusle and Haunter have a hard time switching in but will easily 2HKO Relicanth with Thunderbolt. Mawile's Intimidate, immunity to Toxic, and Rock resistance make it a great switch-in as well, although it'll still take a decent amount from Earthquake; however, against Earthquake-less sets Mawile will easily get up a Substitute and start boosting with Swords Dance.</p> <p>In general, Hidden Power Grass destroys Relicanth, and a lot of Pokemon can easily find the room to stick it on their sets with the sole intention of nailing Relicanth with it. Murkrow in particular is notorious for having this option waiting in the wings, but many other Pokemon can find the room for it too, including Chimecho, Golbat, Lickitung, and Water-types like Wailord and Dewgong.</p>",

While it would be great if Relicanth could avoid a 2HKO from powerful STAB Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, literally every other physical attack barely even fazes this fish, giving your team a super solid backbone to rely on and pivot around. Rock + Ground is great attacking coverage and lets Relicanth fend off a huge portion of the Pokemon it'll be switching into, and having two attacking options means Relicanth is less of a liability while it's sleeping via Rest. That said, Toxic allows Relicanth to effectively wear down common defensive Pokemon like Sableye, and ultimately win stall wars via RestTalk, making it an option over the added coverage that Earthquake provides. Speaking of RestTalk, the combination allows Relicanth to absorb status for the remainder of its team, which is a somewhat rare commodity in NU, and greatly increases its own longevity throughout the match.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is recommended to make Relicanth as physically bulky as possible; however, the EV spread is flexible depending on what you need Relicanth to do for your team. 84 Speed EVs can be run to allow Relicanth to outspeed uninvested Chimecho, but beware that Chimecho typically runs enough Speed to outrun Dewgong, so this may ultimately be a fruitless effort. 108 Attack EVs can be run to always OHKO standard Charmeleon with Rock Slide, although this is the only significant KO picked up by running any Attack less than maximum; otherwise, you're better off just using a more offensively oriented set. Swift Swim should be the ability because there aren't any recoil moves on this set, and the possibility to countersweep rain sweepers should always be kept open.</p> <p>Body Slam can be run on this set over Toxic or Earthquake to spread around paralysis. Yawn is another option in this moveslot to force the opponent to switch more often and accumulate Spikes damage or to just put the opposing Pokemon to sleep if it stays in, which can be game-changing. While unorthodox and typically not recommended, Calm Mind and Surf can be run on this set to turn Relicanth into an extremely bulky tank that's nearly impenetrable on both defenses. However, Surf is super weak until it's boosted to about +4, and Relicanth will rarely find the time to boost that high, since most special attackers will still blow through it with Grass- or Electric-type moves even if it's boosted. Psych Up can also be run on this set to protect Relicanth from setup sweepers like Calm Mind Chimecho and Swords Dance Kingler, although it will be a dead moveslot in most games.</p> <p>Defensive Relicanth fits best on teams that have glaring weaknesses to the Normal- and Flying-types found in the tier, particularly those that have Bellossom, Hitmonchan, and Venomoth all on the same team. Pairing Relicanth with a specially defensive bulwark like Kecleon can create a nigh-impregnable defensive core, and filling the defensive gap between the two against strong Fighting- and Ground-types with something like Chimecho, Pelipper, or Tangela can be a good idea.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>Relicanth is far and away the bulkiest Choice Band user in the tier and has really good coverage, making it a decent choice for offensive teams looking for a defensive backbone that don't want to lose offensive momentum. Not having STAB on Earthquake is really awful and is a major perk Graveler has over this Relicanth set, as well as access to Explosion, but Relicanth's higher Speed, overall better bulk, and recoil-free Double-Edge make it a better tank. The last slot on this set is largely filler, with Hidden Power Ghost being Relicanth's best attack for Haunter and Chimecho, and Hidden Power Bug getting a marginally better hit on Tangela and Bellossom than Relicanth's other moves.</p> <p>84 Speed EVs let Relicanth outpace minimum Speed Chimecho, which very few of the other Choice Band users in the tier can spare the bulk or Attack to do. Like with any of Relicanth's sets, you can put a lot of different things in the last slot, as you'll rarely, if ever, use it. Sleep Talk is a cool option, and although Relicanth is rarely going to be absorbing Sleep Powder due to the main users being Grass-types, it does do a decent job at absorbing Yawn from the likes of Chimecho and Swalot. Leftovers can be used on this set over Choice Band, but Relicanth wants the power and can usually afford to miss the recovery. If going with Leftovers, Protect makes a phenomenal move to use in the last slot to increase Relicanth's longevity and ease prediction.</p> <p>Relicanth is an exceptionally good check to the Normal- and Flying-types in the tier, making frail attackers that usually have problems with them, such as Flareon and Hitmonchan, good teammates. While Relicanth can switch into Fire-type attacks very easily, it is extremely susceptible to the Grass-type attacks they're normally paired with. Grass- and Bug-types make good teammates, as they can switch into the Grass-type attacks Relicanth fears, and they can switch into Fire-type attacks should it be needed, particularly random Hidden Power Fires from the likes of Venomoth and Chimecho. Relicanth has a hard time with Plusle and other special attackers, making Lickitung, Kecleon, and specially defensive Flareon good teammates as well.</p>"

        "Swift Swim Sweeper": {
          "description": "<p>This set functions as a decent late-game cleaner that separates itself from the pack by being extremely naturally bulky. With the moves chosen, Relicanth has fantastic neutral coverage, further improving its niche over other similar late-game cleaners like Sunny Day sweepers and Salac Berry sweepers like Kingler. The idea with this set is simple: get it in late-game on a Flying-type that Relicanth takes little damage from like Pidgeot, set up Rain Dance, and proceed to clean up the remnants of your opponent's team with the appropriate move. QuakeSlide offers the best possible neutral coverage for Relicanth in two moves. Surf and Hydro Pump are the best choices for the last slot due to the boost they receive from the rain and STAB, even though they use Relicanth's lower Special Attack.</p> <p>There's a lot you can do with the EV spread, but the listed one is recommended and does several things. 52 Speed EVs let Relicanth outspeed minimum Speed Whiscash outside of rain and base Speed 95s and below in rain. 152 Special Attack EVs are enough to OHKO maximum HP Sudowoodo in the rain with Surf after Spikes damage. A bit more Speed can be run to outpace Raticate in the rain, but it's largely unneeded, since Raticate can't do a whole lot to Relicanth (though it may be worth it if you're scared of Reversal sets). Less Special Attack can be run if using Hydro Pump to put those EVs in HP to increase bulk. Surf and the Special Attack EVs can be dropped for something like Double-Edge, Hidden Power Bug, or Substitute. If doing this, move the Special Attack EVs to HP to increase overall bulk, as Relicanth does not need the extra Speed.</p> <p>This set makes a good one-two punch sweeping partner with Huntail, as Huntail can blast open holes in the opponent's defense for Relicanth to come in later to finish the job. Huntail also hits specially and Relicanth physically, making the duo hard to wall. Plusle and Pikachu are also really good offensive teammates, as they can set up Rain Dance and take advantage of the rain with an accurate Thunder, and Pikachu also receives a boosted Surf to play around with.</p> <p>This Relicanth has a really tough time with Grass-types, particularly defensive Tangela and Bellossom, making Flying-types like Murkrow and Fire-types like specially attacking Flareon good teammates. Specially defensive teammates in general are good to have to absorb the Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks aimed Relicanth, making Kecleon and Lickitung good teammates. Relicanth can only KO Hitmonchan if it's been severely weakened, and Relicanth's lower bulk also means that it's more susceptible to Mach Punch than usual, meaning Swalot and Chimecho are good teammates too.</p>"

Facade may also seem like a worthwhile option, but Bagon lacks Guts, so poison is the only acceptable status.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Bagon is unable to 2HKO Koffing with Double-Edge at +1.

Double-Edge is Bagon's strongest physical option, allowing it to threaten common special attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Chinchou after a Dragon Dance. Additionally, Double-Edge hits a majority of the metagame for neutral damage. Bagon is also able to negate the recoil damage from Double-Edge thanks to Rock Head. Brick Break primarily targets Normal- and Steel-types like Aipom, Delcatty, and Magnemite, but it also 2HKOes physically defensive Lileep at +2. Hydro Pump threatens Rock- and Ground-types like Rhyhorn and Cubone. Alternatively, Bagon can use Hidden Power Ghost to avoid being walled by the tier's only Ghost-type, Shuppet. A Lum Berry provides Bagon with a free setup opportunity against status users. The most notable instance of this is against Elekid that may try to use Toxic or Thunder Wave to reduce Bagon's chances of sweeping.</p> <p>Bagon excels on offense and balance teams that aim to take advantage of Elekid that lack Ice Punch. It can withstand one Thunderbolt when healthy and can outspeed and OHKO it after one Dragon Dance boost. Wallbreakers like Pidgeotto and Aipom appreciate this immensely, as Elekid outspeeds them and threatens them with Thunderbolt. Secondary sweepers such as Masquerain, Croconaw, Growlithe, and Butterfree all benefit from Elekid's removal as well. These sweepers can also act as mid-game breakers if Bagon is more poised for a successful late-game. Butterfree is worth mentioning, as its access to Sleep Powder creates more opportunities for Bagon to set up. Bagon can be completely walled by Koffing, so special attackers that threaten it such as Chinchou, Croconaw, and Elekid pair well with Bagon. Elekid is worth mentioning, as it can offensively check Aipom so Bagon doesn't need to rely on a Speed boost from Dragon Dance.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Shelgon stands out in the NU tier as the only usable Dragon-type (Dragonair is there but not really usable), giving it a unique defensive and offensive niche. Access to Dragon Dance makes it very dangerous, and setting up is pretty easy overall thanks to its typing and good physical bulk. It's also a very durable defensive option with access to Wish to keep it and its teammates healthy throughout the match. A huge weakness to Ice and being specially frail hurts it, though, and it lacks a usable STAB move. Still, for teams looking for a good surprise offensive or defensive option, Shelgon is certainly a viable candidate.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky Dragon Dance set is certainly possible, but not focusing on Shelgon's Speed can lead to it being ineffective against offensive teams, and not focusing on its Attack can leave its overall damage output much to be desired, even at +2.</p> <p>Beyond that, Shelgon actually has a surprisingly wide movepool; it just can't make use of a lot of it. Hydro Pump and Fire Blast can both prove to be very useful on either the Dragon Dance or defensive set, with the former easily OHKOing Graveler and the latter 2HKOing Mawile, but the unique KOs they get pretty much stop there. Iron Defense can make Shelgon nigh untouchable physically and could make very good use of the last slot on the Dragon Dance set, but it does nothing to protect Shelgon from special attacks or critical hits. Finally, Shelgon has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, meaning it could be a useful defensive teammate to weather sweepers, especially when also running Wish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types, particularly Dewgong and Whiscash with Ice Beam, will prove to be the best switch-ins to Shelgon, with the former only being 2HKOed at best by any of Shelgon's attacks at +1, and the latter not even facing a 2HKO from Double-Edge at +2 (assuming it's fully physically defensive). Offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail won't be able to switch in as easily, but they'll cleanly OHKO even defensive Shelgon with Ice Beam after a layer of Spikes. It should be mentioned here as well that Glalie will easily outspeed any Shelgon and cleanly OHKO it with Ice Beam as well.</p> <p>Mawile and Metang probably make the next best switch-ins, as they resist Double-Edge and won't take much damage from Brick Break or Hidden Power Ground. They do need to be careful of Shelgon just boosting in their faces, though, and they need to watch out for Fire Blast, but it's super rare on Shelgon overall. Defensive Tangela also avoids the 2HKO from Double-Edge even at +2, and it can hit Shelgon with Leech Seed and Stun Spore quite easily. Finally, any strong special attacker will be able to break through even defensive Shelgon without much trouble, including Haunter, Chimecho, Plusle with Hidden Power Ice, and Crawdaunt.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Bring Shelgon in late-game on something that can't really hurt it, like Flareon or Hidden Power Grass Plusle, set up with Dragon Dance, and pummel the foe with the appropriate move. Double-Edge will be Shelgon's main weapon and comes with no recoil thanks to Rock Head. Rock Slide and Brick Break give the best possible coverage against the Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types that resist Double-Edge. Brick Break can be replaced with Hidden Power Ground, though, to trade a super effective hit on Lickitung for a 4x super effective hit on Magcargo and a super effective hit on Metang.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is needed to outpace Raticate and the numerous base 95s at +1, although Adamant can be used, as Shelgon will then have a chance to OHKO Pidgeot with Rock Slide and a much higher chance to OHKO Hitmonchan after a layer of Spikes with Double-Edge. Speaking of which, Spikes is really important for the success of this set, as Shelgon is just on the cusp of a lot of OHKOs and 2HKOs at +1, making Glalie and Cacturne highly recommended offensive Spiking teammates. Shelgon's movepool is pretty tiny, so there's not a lot to use in the moveslots over the choices given, although Substitute is available and could prove useful to ease setting up and protect Shelgon from debilitating status or priority.</p> <p>Shelgon excels at cleaning up weakened teams, as it can 2HKO a large portion of the tier but normally won't be OHKOing much, especially bulky Pokemon like Graveler, Sudowoodo, defensive Tangela, Lickitung, and Whiscash. Shelgon's only relevant type weakness is to Ice-type attacks, which are few and far between, but having a defensive backbone to absorb them is a good idea, particularly specially defensive Normal-types like Lickitung and Kecleon and Pokemon that will beat Dewgong one-on-one like Sableye and Hitmonchan.</p>"

        "Physically Defensive": {
          "description": "<p>Shelgon is physically defensive enough to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Hitmonchan's Sky Uppercut after a turn of Protect, and that fact combined with a lack of physical weaknesses gives Shelgon a nice defensive niche in the tier. While Shelgon's Defense is high, it has little in the way of a supportive movepool outside of Wish, but it certainly makes do with what it's got. The main reason you'd choose Shelgon over Lickitung as a Wish passer is its lack of Fighting weakness, while Shelgon's appeal over Flareon is its higher physical Defense and lack of Water and Ground weaknesses.</p> <p>Protect is super nice for scouting Choice Band attacks, racking up Toxic damage, and guaranteeing Wish recovery, but it can be forgone for Roar, which not only is rare in the tier but also prevents the opponent from using Shelgon as complete setup fodder. Roar also pairs nicely with the defensive nature of this set by exposing the opponent's team and racking up Spikes damage. Body Slam is pretty weak, especially without STAB or Attack investment, but it's nice for a chance to paralyze, which completely cripples a couple of the Pokemon Shelgon can wall, namely Pidgeot and Raticate. There's not a lot available that can go in its place; Dragon Claw is available and will get roughly the same amount of damage on targets with equal defenses like Pidgeot, but it lacks a paralysis chance, will be significantly weaker against specially defensive targets like Hitmonchan and Flareon, and still leaves Shelgon walled by Steel-types like Mawile; however, the higher damage against Rock-types like Sudowoodo could prove useful if your team is weak against them.</p> <p>While Shelgon's typing is better suited for a specially defensive set, as it resists key special types in Water, Fire, Electric, and Grass, it simply doesn't have the bulk to pull it off, so it's not a good idea to take Shelgon in that direction. Hidden Power Ghost can be used somewhere on the set to ensure that Haunter can't just switch into Shelgon for free, but Haunter isn't super hard to counter and Shelgon will normally be passing Wish to its teammates anyway. Switching up the set and replacing Wish and Protect with RestTalk is an option that gives Shelgon a lot of longevity, but Shelgon just doesn't have the defensive or offensive presence on the battlefield to really make it worth it in the long run.</p> <p>Spikes support can really make or break the effectiveness of this set, making Glalie and defensive Roselia great teammates worth strong consideration. Bulky Water-types, particularly RestTalk Dewgong and Whiscash, will walk all over this set thanks to Ice Beam and the fact they won't mind being hit by status. Due to this, bulky Bellossom and offensive teammates to shatter these Pokemon such as Plusle and Haunter are needed. Chimecho with Taunt or Heal Bell can set up on this set pretty easily, making Dark-types good teammates as well.</p> <p>Finally, defensive Shelgon is best used in a defensive core with specially defensive teammates to cover those offensive Pokemon it cannot beat itself. Flareon stands out from the pack due to its access to Wish, resistance to Ice, and good synergy with Shelgon all around; the only issue with this core is the fact they are both weak to offensive Water-types like Seadra and Huntail. Other specially defensive candidates include Kecleon and Dewgong, both of which enjoy Wish support and Shelgon's ability to take on Hitmonchan.</p>"

Intimidate allows Salamence to mitigate damage from many physical attackers in the tier. It is an excellent check to physically-based Salac Berry sweepers, most notably Heracross and Groudon. For a defensive Pokemon, Salamence has a good base Speed, allowing it to outspeed various base 90 Speed Pokemon like Groudon and Kyogre. While it has plenty of great defensive capabilities, it is often inferior to the more common defensive option in Lugia, as Lugia possesses much greater overall stats and supports its teammates with Reflect and Pressure. While being a solid physical wall, its typing leaves it virtually always forced out by special attackers, as Salamence cannot withstand the tier's common and powerful special attacks.

      "overview": "<p>Salamence is one of the defining threats in ADV OU due to its fantastic offensive stats, expansive movepool, and defensive utility from Intimidate alongside a useful resistance palette. The latter two let it run a variety of sets that can dismantle multiple team types while providing important defensive utility. Mixed Salamence has a great matchup against Toxic, Spikes, and Sandstorm (TSS) cores, more specifically ones that contain Skarmory, Blissey, Swampert, and Tyranitar; its good Speed and coverage also make it generally effective against moderately fast offense teams, which usually lack good options to switch into and eliminate it. With Choice Band, the powerful and fast Salamence becomes one of the strongest wallbreakers in ADV OU—it also becomes one of the most effective ways to prevent Baton Pass Celebi from passing Calm Mind or Swords Dance. Dragon Dance Salamence excels as a sweeper against offensive teams that rely on frail physical checks. Its defensive properties are not to be overlooked; it is one of the sturdiest checks to Fighting-types such as Heracross and Breloom. Moreover, Intimidate is useful against physical Tyranitar and Salamence, especially to stop a Dragon Dance sweep. Additionally, Salamence is one of the few viable Pokemon with Wish, allowing it to heal itself and teammates effectively.</p> <p>There are no Pokemon that can comfortably deal with all Salamence sets, but each set is answerable once revealed. Mixed Salamence is walled completely by Milotic, Porygon2, and defensive Zapdos if it lacks Rock Slide and is easily revenge killed by most threats with an Ice-type move. Choice Band Salamence is frequently prediction reliant due to its individually weak attacks, can be countered by common physical walls like Skarmory, and can get Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar if it locks into Hidden Power Flying or Rock Slide. Dragon Dance Salamence has a harder time sweeping when its checks, especially bulky Water-types, Gengar, and even Blissey, are healthy. Offensively, Salamence can be threatened by a variety of prominent and fast Pokemon like Gengar, Starmie, and Aerodactyl, limiting the offensive potential of non-Dragon Dance sets. Additionally, Salamence frequently requires prediction just to get in effectively, as its 4x weakness to Ice and vulnerability to status mean that Pokemon it can check with its Speed and coverage, such as weakened Blissey, Swampert, and Tyranitar, can devastate it on the switch.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salamence can run a more dedicated defensive and supportive set with 252 HP and 252 Defense EVs that utilizes Wish and Protect. The remaining moves are chosen to suit the team and can range from two attacks, like Hidden Power Flying + Earthquake or Dragon Claw + Flamethrower, to a single attack and a utility move like Roar or Toxic. Flamethrower is a good attacking move to accompany Toxic, as it hits poison-immune Steel-types. This can be useful in teams with bulky setup Pokemon such as Rest Snorlax and defensive Suicune or dedicated stall teams such as those running defensive Hariyama, though the lack of power increases the team's weakness to Rest Suicune and Calm Mind Celebi.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence can run a mixed set utilizing Fire Blast over Hidden Power Flying, especially to exploit a Calm Mind boost passed from Celebi. Dropping Hidden Power Flying, however, makes it much harder for Salamence to get past Claydol and Flygon. In its defense, Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi tends to have a good matchup against Claydol teams. Unfortunately, the lack of STAB also makes it easier for the opponent to pivot around and weaken Salamence with their own use of Intimidate. Dragon Dance Salamence can also use Hidden Power Grass in lieu of Hidden Power Flying to break through Swampert, though not only do the same drawbacks apply, but Celebi also walls it. Refresh is a nifty matchup pick that turns bulky Water-type stops that lack Ice Beam or Roar into setup fodder, namely Milotic, some Swampert, and defensive Starmie. This comes at the expense of an attacking move, which is usually Rock Slide to preserve Salamence's ability to hit Claydol, a common Milotic partner. Salamence thus becomes walled by Zapdos and Aerodactyl.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is an option on mixed Salamence in order to OHKO Aerodactyl and Moltres, which can be really useful if Salamence has been passed a Speed boost, but this requires giving up another attack. Sleep Talk can be used on Choice Band or mixed Salamence for a safe switch-in to Breloom and Venusaur. Toxic is also another option on the mixed set to cripple Water-types without Refresh and Porygon2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are very few Pokemon that can check all of Salamence's sets because it can hit hard both physically and specially. You will need a combination of the Pokemon below if you want to successfully check each Salamence set.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune wall specific Salamence sets and threaten Salamence back with Ice-type coverage, Toxic, or phazing. Swampert is the most robust check to physical Salamence under sand, but it should be wary of mixed Salamence running Hidden Power Grass. Milotic is the best check to all variants of Salamence in a vacuum, but it can frequently be put into 2HKO range of Choice Band Salamence and possibly mixed Salamence when chipped. It is prone to critical hits in the process of healing with Recover. Milotic still requires secondary checks. Defensive Suicune without Ice Beam can phaze physical Salamence with Roar and set up on mixed Salamence. However, it is an unreliable check, as Salamence can muscle through it with critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is one of the biggest problems for physical Salamence due to it walling both Choice Band and Dragon Dance sets to cripple it with Toxic or set up Spikes. However, Skarmory should not be a team's sole Salamence check because Salamence is frequently paired with Magneton and other wallbreakers.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Aerodactyl, Gengar, Starmie, Zapdos, and Jolteon can switch in, possibly after a KO, to force Choice Band and mixed Salamence out with super effective coverage or status moves. Starmie and physically defensive Gengar have the added luxury of surviving any physical or special attack and threatening to OHKO with their Ice-type coverage or, in the case of defensive Starmie, disable Salamence with Thunder Wave. Aerodactyl and Zapdos can get KOed by Choice Band Salamence's Rock Slide but are safe switch-ins against mixed Salamence too. As Starmie and defensive Gengar can survive boosted Salamence's attacks, they are also single-use checks to Dragon Dance Salamence. Many common Pokemon can also tank a hit from Dragon Dance Salamence and retaliate with Explosion, including Metagross, Snorlax, Claydol, Cloyster, and Forretress. Mixed Salamence OHKOes Salamence without bulk investment under sand with Dragon Claw, and with Intimidate to soften physical blows, it can be an emergency check to physical Salamence as well.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey is a decent mixed Salamence check, as it can OHKO Salamence with Ice Beam or Counter and heal off damage from Brick Break. It can also check Dragon Dance Salamence in a pinch, but a Rock Slide flinch can put it out of commission. Blissey is vulnerable to Spikes and sand damage and cannot check Salamence well if it becomes too weakened.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 is able to check mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence thanks to its Ice Beam and Recover. It even checks Choice Band Salamence pretty reliably, as only Brick Break can 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Tyranitar</strong>: Pursuit Tyranitar can trap and deal a heavy blow to Choice Band Salamence if it's locked into Hidden Power Flying or Rock Slide. Sacrificing a Pokemon weak to these moves can thus form a reliable strategy for removing Salamence that does not require the risky predictions typically associated with Choice Band users.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Pokemon with Intimidate such as Gyarados and other Salamence can stop Dragon Dance Salamence from sweeping or soften its attacks mid-game, allowing Pokemon such as Metagross, Tyranitar, and bulky Water-types an easier time switching in. Mixed Salamence itself can also survive Rock Slide after Intimidate and attempt to KO opposing physical Salamence.</p>",

        "Mixed": {
          "description": "<p>Mixed Salamence is able to heavily damage most of the tier, including common Pokemon like Tyranitar, Swampert, Metagross, and Skarmory, with its coverage moves. It is a wallbreaker that is particularly potent against Toxic + Spikes + Sandstorm (TSS) teams and moderate-Speed offensive teams with its good Speed tier and coverage. Dragon Claw hits most of the tier neutrally and is a safe choice to use if a switch is expected. Specifically, Dragon Claw hits foe Dragon-types like Flygon and Salamence hard and chips checks such as Gengar and Zapdos on the switch. Alternatively, Rock Slide can OHKO Moltres and better handle specially defensive Zapdos. Brick Break threatens Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Grass is a key move in order to hit Swampert very hard and 3HKO Suicune, Starmie, and Milotic switch-ins in sand. Fire Blast completes the coverage by handling Steel-types such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross and other Fire-weak threats like Celebi. Additionally, Fire Blast heavily damages Heracross and Breloom, making mixed Salamence a solid check to Fighting-types.</p> <p>Sometimes, other moves can be used over Hidden Power Grass or Brick Break. The most prominent of these are Wish and Roar. Wish is used to support Pokemon that have a better matchup against the opponent's team. For example, when against strong defensive answers such as Milotic, Suicune, defensive Starmie, and Porygon2, Salamence can use the opportunity to pass Wish to a strong offensive threat like Snorlax or Heracross instead of using a weak coverage move. Roar can be used to mitigate weakness to defensive Suicune and Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi on teams that have neither strong offensive presence nor specially robust phazers, such as ones featuring Forretress.</p> <p>Getting the best utility out of mixed Salamence frequently involves aggressively exploiting Salamence's tendency to force switches; this is especially important in the absence of Spikes. For example, one can anticipate Blissey's entry with Brick Break, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can recover from Salamence's attacks. A well-timed coverage move that cripples a crucial wall like Blissey, Swampert, or Metagross can sometimes tilt the game heavily in favor of one's Zapdos or Tyranitar. Due to only having 8 PP, Fire Blast should be used conservatively against Pokemon that may have Protect or Pressure such as Skarmory, Suicune, specially defensive Zapdos, and pivot Moltres. Salamence can choose to run a Naive nature instead of Rash so that it can outspeed Moltres, Celebi, and some Gengar sets. However, Rash allows Salamence to OHKO other offensive Salamence in sand and offensive Swampert. Additional Attack investment can help Brick Break and Rock Slide hit some damage rolls, such as 2HKOing Blissey and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Salamence is a staple on momentum-based offensive teams. Metagross and mixed Salamence make for a great physically defensive backbone on offensive teams, providing short-term defensive coverage without losing momentum. Metagross can chip walls such as defensive Swampert and Skarmory so that Salamence can more easily OHKO them. Likewise, Salamence can weaken these walls to give Metagross an easier time breaking through them. Note that Metagross's set choice is highly flexible and depends on the team's needs; Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash, mixed Metagross's Psychic, and even defensive Metagross's Toxic can heavily cripple Swampert or even defeat it with some luck, and all sets can use Explosion on Water-types. In particular, Choice Band Metagross's Meteor Mash has a high probability of breaking through Water-types with an Attack boost or a critical hit. Mixed Metagross can potentially pack Pursuit, which takes out Gengar after some chip damage from Salamence, or at least limits its ability to check Salamence. Agility Metagross variants especially enjoy Rock Slide Salamence removing Zapdos, Gyarados, and Moltres.</p> <p>Since mixed Salamence dismantles physically defensive cores that incorporate Skarmory and Swampert, physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Aerodactyl pair well with it. Salac Berry Heracross is also a synergistic sweeper for a different reason—mixed Salamence frequently lures in and chips Flying-types and Gengar, which prevent Heracross from sweeping. Generally, Fighting-types like Heracross, Hariyama, and Breloom benefit from Salamence luring in their checks and tend to do well against teams that wall Salamence with Milotic, defensive Suicune, or defensive Starmie.</p> <p>Snorlax checks common special attackers that Salamence struggles against such as Starmie, Zapdos, and Jolteon. It also pressures mixed Salamence's walls—Milotic, defensive Starmie, Blissey, Porygon2—and can help put Skarmory and Metagross in KO range of Fire Blast with its coverage and Self-Destruct. Salamence can switch into Heracross and Breloom, which take advantage of Snorlax. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Cloyster can help put Pokemon such as Blissey, Tyranitar, and Swampert in KO range of Salamence's coverage moves. Spikes can also greatly reduce the need for prediction. In return, Salamence can give Spikes setters support against Fighting-types and be a strong, fast cleaner. Defensive Jirachi can provide mixed Salamence with Wish support, while Salamence pressures its checks—Swampert, Tyranitar, Metagross, and Snorlax—with its coverage moves. In some matchups, Jirachi will need to predict moves and switch-ins like Earthquake and Celebi to pass Wish to Salamence. Tyranitar's summoned sand is important for retaining chip damage on bulkier Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Blissey so that Brick Break 2HKOes them. Additionally, sand preserves damage on checks like Zapdos and Gengar.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Salamence is a potent combination of offense and defense. It excels as a wallbreaker with the movepool to OHKO or 2HKO a majority of ADV OU. At the same time, its typing and Intimidate let it switch into Celebi, defensive Suicune, Fighting-types, and Earthquakes easily. These offensive and defensive properties make Choice Band Salamence a good fit on balanced teams, especially those without sand. First, balance teams usually consist of a defensive backbone with only one or two offensive Pokemon. The passive backbone tends to sit at the mercy of Calm Mind + Baton Pass Celebi, defensive Suicune, and Fighting-types, so the team's offensive Pokemon should be able to switch into and force them out. Second, as balanced teams have a limited number of offensive Pokemon, the primary offense is often required to hit hard across a variety of matchups. Third, the defensive backbone can absorb momentum losses of the offensive Pokemon. Choice Band Salamence can lose momentum because it lacks the flexibility of switching moves, unlike mixed and Dragon Dance Salamence, but in exchange, they are walled more easily and cannot pressure Celebi and Suicune as easily.</p> <p>Hidden Power Flying is Salamence's strongest physical STAB move, dealing heavy damage to most targets and threatening Celebi and Fighting-types. Earthquake nails Tyranitar and Steel-types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Magneton. Rock Slide hits Flying-types hard; it OHKOes uninvested Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Moltres, and 2HKOes defensive Zapdos, opposing Salamence, and Gyarados. Its flinch chance can be used to break down defensive answers such as Skarmory in desperate situations. Brick Break OHKOes Tyranitar and heavily damages Blissey and Snorlax; it also 2HKOes Porygon2, which can recover from Salamence's other attacks.</p> <p>There are significant compromises to be made when choosing Salamence's nature. Adamant Choice Band Salamence is able to 3HKO defensive Suicune, OHKO Zapdos, and possibly OHKO defensive Gengar in sand. A Jolly nature is best for making Salamence a fast check to dangerous offensive Pokemon. Notably, it lets Salamence prevent Baton Pass Celebi from passing stats, threaten Moltres, and Speed tie with Timid Jirachi and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Salamence excels on balance and occasionally bulky offense builds as the team's immediate offensive threat. Magneton is almost always partnered with it for removing Skarmory.</p> <p>Choice-locked Salamence loses momentum easily, so it appreciates sturdy defensive Pokemon as partners. Common physically defensive partners include Skarmory, Protect Metagross, defensive Suicune, and defensive Swampert. Skarmory is the Spiker that has the strongest synergy with Salamence, as it is also a wall that can switch into Metagross, Swampert, and perhaps Tyranitar. Spikes generally helps with wallbreaking and makes Hidden Power Flying a safe move choice that chips switch-ins. In particular, Spikes provides the chip damage needed to OHKO Metagross, Jirachi, and Blissey and 2HKO Milotic. Protect Metagross complements Salamence with its Rock resistance and can use Toxic to cripple Swampert and Suicune. Defensive Suicune switches into Metagross and Swampert well but is less robust against Tyranitar; Claydol and defensive Metagross thus help bolster the physically defensive core. Defensive Swampert switches into most physical threats, but it should ideally be paired with Skarmory for other Swampert and to allow some flexibility in pivoting around lures and Metagross's Explosion.</p> <p>Choice Band Salamence also needs sturdy specially defensive partners, the most common of which are Blissey, Celebi, and Snorlax. Blissey is the most reliable special wall; it checks Gengar, Zapdos, and Starmie, which outspeed Salamence and threaten to OHKO it. Wish support from Blissey can help negate the chip damage Salamence receives in sand. Celebi is also a decent special wall; it may struggle with Starmie and is prone to getting trapped by Dugtrio or Pursuit Tyranitar, so it is sometimes found alongside Curse Snorlax, a secondary special check. Celebi has more opportunities for synergy; its Leech Seed chips the foe and heals Salamence—important given the lack of Leftovers—and it can use Baton Pass to let Magneton to trap Skarmory more reliably. It also pressures Swampert harder. Snorlax is the shakiest of the special walls, but with Curse, it has the greatest ability to pressure Salamence's checks in Milotic and Suicune. While most Snorlax are found alongside Celebi in this context, a small fraction of bulky offense teams use Snorlax as the sole special check, perhaps in conjunction with Claydol or Suicune for additional defensive coverage against Electric- or Water-types. In return for protecting Salamence from special threats, special walls benefit from Salamence protecting them from Fighting-types.</p> <p>Choice Band Salamence has several fringe partners. It is possible to use Salamence without Magneton, provided that one has a spinner to stop Skarmory's Spikes and other Pokemon that force Skarmory in to take strong hits. Usually, this leads to a core of Choice Band Salamence; Starmie, Claydol, or Forretress; and a Fighting-type like Heracross, Hariyama, or Medicham. Occasionally, one can use Dugtrio to remove Pursuit Tyranitar, which otherwise gets the opportunity to chip Salamence heavily upon entry. Finally, there is a small fraction of bulky offense teams that use Choice Band Salamence with Gyarados as a sweeper in the Magneton offense archetype. Gyarados acts as a switch-in to Water-types and a secondary line of defense against physical threats with Intimidate, stopping Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Aerodactyl.</p>"
        },
        "Dragon Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence is adept at sweeping offensive teams that rely on frail Pokemon such as offensive Swampert and Metagross or revenge killers like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Starmie to check physical sweepers. This proficiency comes from Salamence's Speed; unlike Tyranitar, +1 Salamence outspeeds the entire metagame. Dragon Dance Salamence also offers some unique defensive properties; it is the best Heracross counter, with the ability to OHKO, boost its Speed past Salac Berry variants, and heal with Leftovers. Unfortunately, Dragon Dance Salamence suffers in terms of power, bulk, and susceptibility to Intimidate. Many common Pokemon seen as physically frail like defensive Zapdos, Gengar, and even Blissey can survive a boosted attack and stop Salamence from sweeping. Opposing Salamence can also deny a sweep with Intimidate; although Dragon Dance Tyranitar can similarly be stopped, it more heavily pressures opposing Salamence with its STAB Rock Slide.</p> <p>Hidden Power Flying is Salamence's strongest attack. While it is comparable to Earthquake in power, it hits Celebi and Fighting-types super effectively and Claydol and Flygon neutrally. It also dissuades the opponent from weakening Salamence by switching to Intimidate Salamence or Gyarados on Earthquake. Rock Slide threatens Zapdos, Moltres, Aerodactyl, Gyarados, and other Salamence. Due to the flinch chance, it also allows Salamence to take down Skarmory despite being a 3HKO. Earthquake completes the coverage by threatening Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Metagross. Occasionally, Brick Break is used over Earthquake to help Salamence beat Blissey and Tyranitar at the expense of coverage against Metagross and Jirachi.</p> <p>Salamence can use a variety of EV spreads that differ mostly in trading off Attack for Speed and bulk. The only mandatory benchmark is 116 Speed EVs for outspeeding Aerodactyl and Jolteon after a boost. The listed EVs allow Salamence to outspeed Adamant Heracross. It is possible to increase the Speed investment to 180 EVs for Moltres or simply maximize Speed at the expense of bulk. This allows Salamence to outspeed Jolly Heracross and increases its chances of outspeeding other Dragon Dance Salamence, Gyarados, and Agility Metagross that try to get into a boosting war. It also Speed ties with neutral-natured Zapdos and mixed Salamence, which can be important because Salamence usually cannot afford to boost against them.</p> <p>Salamence can also run a specially defensive EV spread of 180 Atk / 212 SpD / 116 Spe, which takes defensive Gengar's Ice Punch and defensive Swampert's Ice Beam, turning two of the most prominent Salamence checks into non-answers or setup opportunities. Less commonly, these EVs also guarantee that Salamence survives Timid Jirachi's Ice Punch. Note that the divestment from Attack can be significant, for near-guaranteed OHKOs on uninvested Tyranitar and Zapdos after a boost become roughly two-thirds chances.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence's use and role depend on the team and matchup. One needs to discern whether its HP should be used liberally for defensive pivoting and inducing chip damage, sacrificed to wallbreak for other sweepers, or preserved for a Dragon Dance sweep in the endgame. Salamence can be used mid-game to switch into Fighting-types, defensive Suicune, Celebi, and other physical Salamence, and it can also pivot in on Earthquake to weaken Tyranitar, Swampert, Flygon, Claydol, and Snorlax with Intimidate. Most of these Pokemon are also potential setup targets; even some threatening Pokemon like Tyranitar, defensive Swampert, and Jirachi can be set up on in specific circumstances, as Intimidate softens Rock Slide's damage, and Salamence can have EVs to survive Swampert's and Jirachi's Ice-type coverage. Additionally, Salamence can set up on Choice-locked Pokemon like Dugtrio and Aerodactyl; these are revenge killers that offensive teams sometimes use to relieve their physical weaknesses, yet +1 Salamence bypasses them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Salamence fits well on momentum-based teams that benefit from its potential to sweep over the general utility of the mixed set. Occasionally, it can also fit on Magneton-based balance teams in lieu of Choice Band Salamence, where it pivots into Fighting-types, Celebi, and defensive Suicune. Most of Salamence's partners are geared towards breaking through its most prominent walls in Skarmory and bulky Water-types, most notably Swampert. Magneton is one of Salamence's most effective partners, as it can trap and remove Skarmory. Metagross is another effective partner that can plow through those walls. Choice Band Metagross is great for removing Skarmory and bulky Water-types with Explosion. While it targets Skarmory less specifically than Magneton, Choice Band Metagross prevents Skarmory from setting Spikes, which can exacerbate typical physically offensive teams' weakness to special sweepers like Starmie and Gengar. Mixed Metagross is great for wearing Skarmory and Swampert down over the course of a game. Pursuit on mixed Metagross also chips Gengar and puts it into boosted Salamence's KO range. Defensive Metagross is a good choice in conjunction with Magneton, where Metagross has the flexibility of defensive and offensive use with Explosion or Toxic to wallbreak against bulky Water-types. This set also makes the best use of the physically defensive synergy of Salamence and Metagross.</p> <p>A variety of Tyranitar sets can also lure Water-types in to chip them. The most prominent example is Dragon Dance + Hidden Power Grass Tyranitar, which frequently leaves the opponent no choice but to expend a huge amount of HP on their bulky Water-type. Hidden Power Grass is not strictly necessary if one has other means of luring and damaging Swampert or if the rest of the team has a good matchup against Toxic, Sandstorm, and Spikes (TSS) teams, which Swampert is usually found on and Dragon Dance Salamence struggles against. Mixed Tyranitar does not target Water-types as specifically and cannot get past Milotic, but it is great against TSS teams; it can chip Skarmory and other one-time checks like Blissey, defensive Zapdos, Starmie, and physically defensive Celebi. Note that Tyranitar's Sand Stream is really helpful for maintaining chip damage on most Pokemon, especially Milotic, Suicune, Gengar, Blissey, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Offensive Water-types also tend to have good matchups against TSS teams and can switch into defensive Swampert relatively easily. Offensive Swampert is a good choice for heavily damaging Skarmory as it tries to set Spikes, and opposing Swampert is frequently compelled to trade blows for the lack of a better switch-in, unwittingly facilitating the Salamence sweep. Offensive Swampert is also generally great at luring in and chipping the other aforementioned one-time checks. Offensive Suicune works in a similar vein; it heavily threatens the special walls Celebi and Jirachi, and it can use Toxic to chip Blissey and dissuade it from staying in, thereby also forcing chip damage on Swampert, Skarmory, Gengar, or Starmie. It also trades with Snorlax, which could otherwise use Self-Destruct on Salamence.</p> <p>Enabling a Dragon Dance Salamence sweep also requires chipping bulky Tyranitar and Metagross, which can survive boosted Earthquake and OHKO back. Offensive Snorlax lures in Tyranitar, Metagross, and Skarmory and can chip them with Earthquake, Focus Punch, or Self-Destruct; Curse + Self-Destruct can even take out these checks. Snorlax also acts as a special tank. Gyarados is another great partner for Salamence. They share similar checks in Tyranitar, Metagross, Salamence, Snorlax, Gengar, and Starmie; together, they can overload these checks. For example, a common sequence involves using Dragon Dance Gyarados to force bulky physical Tyranitar in, sacrificing Gyarados to chip Tyranitar with Earthquake, and exploiting Salamence's Intimidate to set up. Also, having two fast Dragon Dance users vastly expands one's coverage—Salamence's Rock Slide can make up for Gyarados's potential lack of coverage for Aerodactyl, while Gyarados can set up on Water-types and potentially carry Hidden Power Ghost for Gengar. Water-types are the bane of Salamence's existence, so Gyarados's ability to set up on Water-types is particularly complementary. Celebi is also able to gain momentum on Water-types. Offensive Calm Mind Celebi can lure in and trade with Tyranitar and Metagross or pass its boosts to Swampert; alternatively, Leech Seed variants can slowly provide the little chip damage needed to bring Tyranitar, Metagross, and Blissey into KO range. Salamence is also able to protect Celebi from Heracross and other physical Salamence sets to an extent. Offensive Jirachi performs a similar role of luring in and chipping Tyranitar, providing Salamence a setup opportunity upon its sacrifice; it can also wrestle with Snorlax to bring it into Salamence's KO range.</p> <p>Chipping Gengar and opposing Salamence also makes it easier for Dragon Dance Salamence to sweep. Heracross lures in and chips these targets, and on top of that, it has a good matchup against Milotic-based stall teams. Heracross is a decent switch-in to Water-types as well.</p> <p>While Dragon Dance Salamence is harder to fit on Spikes teams than mixed Salamence, Spikes helps Salamence break through all grounded checks. On offensive teams, Cloyster can provide Spikes support, and its Explosion and Surf provide the little dent needed to beat Tyranitar, Metagross, or Gengar. On balanced teams, Skarmory is the default Spiker.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Metang's blend of offensive and defensive tools lends it a great amount of versatility and utility within the tier. By virtue of Metang's bulk and typing, it's able to check potent offensive Pokemon like Haunter, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Golbat. Offensively, Metang's access to near-perfect coverage lets it heavily pressure defensive cores, with Meteor Mash's chance to raise Metang's Attack leaving traditional physical walls at risk of being overpowered by even non-Choice Band variants, while its access to Agility helps it give offensive teams headaches. Metang also has access to an incredibly powerful Explosion, which makes it great at drawing in and removing bulky Water-types for its teammates. Unfortunately, Metang struggles to pressure bulky Water-types without sacrificing itself and faces a fair amount of competition from Mawile as a defensive Steel-type due to the latter's better capabilities as a physical wall thanks to Intimidate, which makes it less susceptible to coverage moves from the likes of Murkrow and Pidgeot. Additionally, Metang is vulnerable to common coverage attacks from Pokemon such as Raticate and Pidgeot as well as less common options like Hidden Power Fire from Roselia and Will-O-Wisp from Haunter.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metang can make use of RestTalk so it has a more reliable form of recovery and isn't passive while asleep, although it loses out on a great deal of utility by dropping Toxic, Protect, and Explosion. Rock Slide is usable on Choice Band variants to target Pelipper specifically, but Sleep Talk and Toxic will usually be better options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Wailord, Pelipper, and Whiscash are unfazed by Metang's Meteor Mash and Earthquake and can remove poison with Rest. Relicanth is also a fair check to Metang, although it's more susceptible to being removed by Earthquake. Although Metang can remove all of them bar Relicanth with a well-timed Explosion, trading Metang isn't always ideal, making it an overall unreliable way to deal with them. These foes can retaliate with consistent damage from Surf and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Chimecho, Sableye, and Torkoal can switch into at least one of Metang's moves with ease. In particular, Hidden Power Fire + Heal Bell Chimecho prevents defensive variants of Metang from handling it as reliably. Nonetheless, Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash handily deals with the former two, while Earthquake gives Torkoal problems. Additionally, Toxic severely hampers their longevity and can force Chimecho into giving up momentum by using Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Diglett can trap Metang and KO it with Earthquake after some chip damage so long as it doesn't have a Speed boost from Agility. Other Pokemon like Flareon, Pikachu, and Golbat threaten to OHKO or heavily damage Metang. None of the listed Pokemon can safely switch into Metang's attacks, however.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is Metang's best way to apply consistent damage to Pokemon like Chimecho, Roselia, and Dewgong, while Earthquake hits Steel-resistant foes like Mawile, Flareon, and Torkoal. Toxic lets Metang cripple bulky Water-types like Wailord, Pelipper, and Whiscash, which switch into its primary attacks with ease. Protect is great for racking up poison damage and scouting Choice item Pokemon such as Relicanth and Murkrow. Explosion is an alternative to Protect that lets Metang remove problematic foes for its teammates, although due to Metang's lack of Attack investment, it may require decent chip damage to do so. 252 HP EVs and 228 Special Defense EVs let Metang avoid the 2HKO from defensive Chimecho's +1 Hidden Power Fire, while the Defense EVs help it pivot into attacks from Normal- and Flying-types like Raticate and Pidgeot. Leftovers lets Metang repeatedly switch into attacks from Pokemon like Haunter, Chimecho, and Golbat. Clear Body prevents Attack drops from Mawile's Intimidate as well as Special Defense drops from Psychic users like Haunter and Chimecho.</p> <p>Metang's goal is to switch into Pokemon it checks such as Haunter and begin spreading poison with Toxic and weakening the opposition with its attacks. As Metang draws in defensive Water-types very frequently, it's usually wise to double switch to a teammate that can handle a predicted switch into such a foe. Although Metang can check Choice Band attackers like Pidgeot and Raticate, it must be cautious of super effective coverage from them; use Protect to scout them so you can decide whether or not to keep Metang in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metang benefits greatly from Water-types like Wailord and Pelipper, since they can switch into Fire-type attacks and threaten Ground-types. In return, Metang handles Roselia and Cacturne. On the flip side, Metang can't really make any headway against opposing Water-types, since they commonly carry Rest to remove poison and take little damage from Metang's attacks; therefore, Pokemon like Roselia, Pikachu, and Plusle are beneficial teammates. Although Metang can switch into certain attacks from Pokemon like Pidgeot, Murkrow, and Raticate, it's ideal to pair it with a sturdy physical wall like Chimecho, Sableye, or Torkoal that can more consistently handle such Pokemon.</p>"

        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is a strong STAB attack that deals great damage to common physically defensive Pokemon such as Chimecho and Sableye, with a useful chance to boost Attack to help Metang wallbreak further. Earthquake synergizes well with Meteor Mash, targeting foes like Mawile, Torkoal, and Wailord. Explosion lets Metang outright remove defensive Water-types like Wailord, Pelipper, and Whiscash. Agility lets Metang serve as a late-game sweeper and outspeed Pokemon such as Raticate, Haunter, and Pikachu. Protect and Toxic are alternatives to Agility that aid Metang in wallbreaking; Protect provides it with insurance against Choice Band Pokemon like Relicanth and Pidgeot that only have one attack to threaten Metang with, while Toxic cripples Pokemon like Sableye and Pelipper. 124 Speed EVs allow Metang to outspeed base 65 Speed Pokemon like Roselia and defensive Flareon; the remaining EVs with an Adamant nature maximize Metang's Attack and improve its bulk somewhat. Leftovers helps sustain Metang's health against attacks from Pokemon it soft checks like Haunter and Pidgeot. Clear Body prevents Attack drops from Mawile's Intimidate as well as Special Defense drops from Psychic users like Haunter and Chimecho.</p> <p>Early-game, Metang should be focusing on using its great coverage to weaken its checks so it can sweep late-game with Agility. Against more offensive builds, however, using Agility can help let Metang wallbreak more safely, with it no longer having to worry about being revenge killed by a faster foe. Gauging when to use Explosion is necessary; it is usually ideal to use it to remove a bulky Water-type like Whiscash or Pelipper when they're expected to switch in, assuming Metang's defensive utility is no longer needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Pokemon like Roselia and Glalie is incredibly useful in wearing down checks like Wailord, Whiscash, and Sableye so Metang can sweep late-game more consistently. Additionally, having Pokemon like offensive Wailord and Flareon that can directly pressure bulky Water-types is helpful. If using Metang as more of a wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, Pokemon such as Huntail and Pupitar that appreciate it pressuring Pokemon such as Wailord and Whiscash with Explosion are ideal. On the other hand, other Self-Destruct and Explosion users like Wailord and Haunter are good to remove checks to Metang like opposing Wailord and Chimecho.</p>"

        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Meteor Mash and Earthquake have amazing offensive synergy, with Meteor Mash smacking anything that doesn't resist it for great damage and Earthquake hitting resistant targets such as Wailord, Torkoal, and opposing Metang for a good amount. Choice Band-boosted Explosion essentially lets Metang remove any foe that isn't resistant or immune to it, with bulky Water-types being a common target. Sleep Talk is beneficial for leading with Metang, letting it absorb Venomoth's Sleep Powder, although Toxic is a fine alternative so Metang can cripple bulky Water-types. Maximum Speed investment is necessary so Metang can outspeed Sunny Day Bellossom outside of sun. Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature and Choice Band allows Metang to 2HKO defensive Chimecho and Sableye. Clear Body prevents Attack drops from Mawile's Intimidate as well as Special Defense drops from Psychic users like Haunter and Chimecho.</p> <p>With this set, Metang will only be looking to use a move other than Meteor Mash on expected switches into resistant foes; otherwise, Meteor Mash is optimal due to its great power and damage output against neutral targets like Chimecho and defensive Sableye. Although Earthquake can generate decent damage against Wailord and Whiscash, particularly with Spikes support, Explosion is a guaranteed way to remove them, so long as it connects. However, be careful with your timing of it; if Metang's defensive properties are helpful to check a Pokemon like Haunter or Pidgeot, it may be more beneficial to keep chipping away with Earthquake or cripple them with Toxic if you opt to run it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes from Glalie or Roselia is extremely beneficial, as it makes breaking through Wailord and Whiscash with Earthquake less of a daunting task. Roselia is also great because it can threaten heavy damage to Water-types and paralyze faster Pokemon like Murkrow and Pidgeot with Stun Spore. Late-game sweepers such as Huntail, Calm Mind Chimecho, and Salac or Petaya Berry Haunter benefit from Metang's wallbreaking; in particular, Huntail enjoys having Wailord removed by Metang's Explosion, while Chimecho and Haunter appreciate Sableye and opposing Chimecho being heavily pressured.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Metagross excels in the Uber metagame thanks to its excellent offenses, bulk, and defensive typing, giving it a strong case for being included on nearly any kind of team. Offensively, its mighty Meteor Mash is one of the most difficult attacks in the tier to switch into, and it has all of the coverage it could ask for to complement it and threaten common switch-ins. In addition, its Explosion is among the most powerful attacks in the game, threatening to OHKO nearly any foe that doesn't resist it, and it can also be a menacing late-game cleaner with Agility. Defensively, Metagross's Steel / Psychic typing and great natural bulk let it check several of the most terrifying threats in the tier, such as Deoxys-A, Snorlax, Latios, and Latias, and its access to Pursuit makes it the most popular choice for trapping Deoxys-A. However, although it's great at performing many roles, Metagross is also notable for not being the best at any single thing: as an attacker, it's overshadowed by Groudon in terms of Speed, bulk, and sheer power, and Forretress offers more on the defensive side due to its superior Defense, Bug and Ghost resistances and access to Spikes and Rapid Spin. Metagross's Speed is also on the lower side by Uber standards, leaving it outsped and threatened by many of the tier's heaviest hitters.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic cripples several Pokemon that commonly switch into Meteor Mash, such as Kyogre, Lugia, and Ho-Oh, but since Steel-types such as Skarmory and Forretress are some of Metagross's best answers, it is an inconsistent choice even with Hidden Power Fire or Magneton support. Shadow Ball is a potent coverage option that could fit on the Choice Band set, giving Metagross its strongest and most accurate hit against the many Psychic-types in Ubers, but Meteor Mash hits most of these targets hard enough already. Ice Punch is an interesting choice for the mixed set that deals more damage against Groudon, Rayquaza, and Salamence, but Hidden Power Fire is usually more useful for surprising common Metagross checks. Liechi Berry can give the Agility set a better chance at sweeping, since Metagross is often knocked down to low health as it sets up, and Clear Body means the Attack boost can't be wasted by Salamence's Intimidate; ; however, Metagross cannot fit Substitute to consistently activate it, and the opportunity cost of dropping other items is significant.</p> <p>On the Agility set, an alternative EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can allow Metagross to outspeed positive-natured Deoxys-A variants after a boost. This spread also beats uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon before using Agility, which can be useful if Metagross needs to use Explosion on Kyogre or Ho-Oh in an emergency.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre resists Meteor Mash and packs enough bulk to withstand multiple Earthquakes; its rain-boosted Water-type attacks also pose a major threat to Metagross in return, and Drizzle effectively forces the mixed set to play with three moveslots. However, Choice Band Metagross can still 3HKO Kyogre with Meteor Mash, and all sets can take a Surf if necessary and respond with Explosion. The opponent has to respect this threat whenever Metagross is on the field, as many rain-centric teams can't afford to lose their Kyogre in the mid-game. However, many Kyogre variants run Hydro Pump as their STAB move of choice, partially because it OHKOes Metagross; therefore, Metagross does not fare nearly as well against those sets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory and Forretress are some of the sturdiest Metagross switch-ins in the tier, taking little damage from its physical attacks and setting up Spikes in its face. Despite this, it's worth noting that Forretress can be overwhelmed by Spikes damage and repeated Earthquakes, especially against the Choice Band set, and both Pokemon live in fear of Hidden Power Fire while sun is active. Jirachi walls mixed Metagross and forces the Choice Band set into prediction games, but it must respect Earthquake. Magneton can trap Choice Band Metagross if it locks into any move besides Earthquake, but it will not beat any of its other sets if healthy; rather, it can pick them off at low health or chip them to a point where they can no longer switch into a threatening teammate like Deoxys-A.</p> <p><strong>Groudon</strong>: Groudon's excellent physical bulk lets it switch into Metagross's unboosted attacks with relative ease, and Earthquake will threaten a KO if Metagross isn't in pristine condition. Substitute sets can also play around the threat of Explosion if they have the Speed advantage, which they will more often than not. However, Metagross's Explosion still poses a major threat to Groudon, and the Choice Band set can simply plow through it with boosted Meteor Mashes.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia's ridiculous physical bulk combined with Reflect and Recover means it has little to fear even from Choice Band Metagross, easily PP stalling it with Pressure. However, Metagross's Toxic immunity makes it hard for Lugia to directly force damage on it, leaving it with little to do besides PP stalling and forcing Spikes damage on it with Whirlwind, and a well-timed Explosion can still remove it in many situations, most notably if Lugia is paralyzed and cannot re-set Reflect when it needs to. In addition, Choice Band Lugia is actually checked by Metagross due to its Aeroblast resistance.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh easily switches into Metagross's standard coverage combination of Meteor Mash + Earthquake and threatens it out regardless of the active weather, as Sacred Fire will still deal heavy damage and potentially cripple Metagross with a burn even in rain. However, Ho-Oh's 4x Rock weakness means its trainer must scout Metagross's set for Rock Slide, especially if Metagross is EVed to outspeed it, and Explosion can trade with it on a predicted switch-in if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio can remove Metagross from the game after some chip damage with its Choice Band-boosted Earthquake, although it can't switch into any physical attack besides Rock Slide, making it more of a revenge killer than a true check.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: As a strong physical attacker, Metagross loathes getting burned. While Gengar can't dream of switching into Meteor Mash, its Earthquake and Explosion immunities make it annoying for Metagross to play around, and its Will-O-Wisp will cripple Metagross for the rest of the game. Dusclops can switch into any move besides Meteor Mash and cripple Metagross with its own Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Tank": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is an incredibly spammable STAB move, boasting excellent neutral coverage in Ubers that lets it 2HKO common Pokemon such as offensive Mewtwo, Latios, Heracross, and Blissey. It also has a 20% chance to raise Metagross's Attack, providing a way to break through Pokemon that otherwise force it to switch out or use Explosion, such as Groudon, Deoxys-D, and even Lugia if it's been paralyzed. Earthquake is important coverage for Pokemon that might attempt to switch into Meteor Mash such as Kyogre, Forretress, Jirachi, and Magneton, although the former two are only hit neutrally by it. Pursuit is important for reliably KOing Deoxys-A, and its extreme frailty means Metagross can utilize the move without Special Attack investment. Finally, Explosion is an obscenely powerful nuke that Metagross can use if its team needs to quickly remove an opposing Pokemon or if its health has dropped too low to be useful in other ways. However, Explosion shouldn't be used recklessly, since Skarmory and Forretress, two of this set's best answers, both resist it. If your team is more concerned about Ho-Oh than Deoxys-A, Rock Slide can potentially be slotted over Pursuit, but it's usually more efficient to use Metagross as your Deoxys-A answer.</p> <p>Metagross's naturally great offenses mean it doesn't need full Attack investment to pose a threat; this leaves it free to put more EVs into bulk, making it a better answer to common threats such as Snorlax and Deoxys-A. The given EV spread provides Metagross with enough bulk to reliably fill its defensive roles. Maximum HP and 24 Defense EVs let Metagross avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball, even with a layer of Spikes in play; it also guarantees survival against a Choice Band- or Dragon Dance-boosted Earthquake from Rayquaza. 116 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature ensure Metagross can OHKO bulkless Latios with Meteor Mash if it gains an Attack boost beforehand while also securing 2HKOs against Blissey and maximum HP Latias and ensuring an OHKO on maximum HP Groudon with Explosion. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense to help Metagross withstand various special attacks from Pokemon it's tasked with defeating, such as Thunder from Latios, Deoxys-A, and Mewtwo, as well as Kyogre's Surf in a pinch. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 116 Atk / 48 Def / 92 SpD is viable to guarantee that Metagross survives Adamant Groudon's Earthquake from full health, letting it consistently trade with Explosion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Latios is a classic teammate for Metagross thanks to their excellent synergy. Latios checks Groudon and Kyogre and pressures other Metagross checks such as Skarmory, Lugia, and Ho-Oh; in exchange, Metagross provides a switch-in to Snorlax, Deoxys-A, Mewtwo lacking Fire Blast, and opposing Latios while also threatening Blissey. Kyogre is an excellent partner for both of these Pokemon, as the rain it summons can negate Metagross's Fire weakness, scare away Ho-Oh, and allow Latios to run Thunder for the aforementioned Flying-types. Fitting a Spikes user alongside Metagross can make it significantly harder to switch into; Forretress and Omastar are both solid choices for this. The former also brings Rapid Spin to prevent Metagross from being worn down by opposing Spikes, and the latter checks Ho-Oh and makes for a threatening win condition alongside Kyogre. Metagross can also benefit from the support of Magneton on its team, as its Magnet Pull is the most reliable way to remove Skarmory and Forretress. Teams utilizing Magneton might want to stack additional Self-Destruct and Explosion users alongside Metagross to facilitate a fast-paced, trade-heavy playstyle; Curse Snorlax, lead Mewtwo, Swords Dance Mew, Gengar, and Forretress can all contribute to this while also bringing other utility. Although they share several common checks, Groudon and Metagross are still potentially a great pairing; Groudon can provide a backup check to physical Deoxys-A sets, an insurance policy against rain sweepers like Omastar, and a lure for opposing Steel-types with Overheat. Offensive Groudon sets also appreciate Metagross's help in overwhelming shared checks like Lugia and defensive Kyogre.</p>"
        },
        "Mixed Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Instead of going all-in on physical power, this Metagross variant attempts to lure some of its usual checks by tapping into its respectable Special Attack stat. Meteor Mash remains the STAB move of choice here, hitting a majority of the tier for significant neutral damage and threatening 2HKOs against common targets such as Latios, Mewtwo, Blissey, and Heracross; its 20% chance to boost Metagross's Attack is also useful for punching holes in various bulky Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire is what makes this set stand out: when boosted by Groudon's sunlight, the move has decent odds to OHKO all variants of Forretress, and it will always KO in conjunction with Meteor Mash on the following turn. The move also comfortably 2HKOes Skarmory when sun-boosted, which would otherwise wall Metagross with little effort. Pursuit lets Metagross fill its usual role of switching into and trapping Deoxys-A, although this set has more trouble with Fire Punch and SubPetaya variants due to the low Special Defense investment. Pursuit is also more useful against other targets (most notably Gengar) on this set due to the Special Attack EVs, although it's more of a tool for securing chip damage on forced switches than a reliable method of trapping anything besides Deoxys-A. Explosion hits any target that doesn't resist it extremely hard, likely OHKOing said target on the spot unless they've accrued a Defense boost or hidden themselves behind a Substitute. It's worth noting that since Skarmory and Forretress are usually the best tools for absorbing a Metagross Explosion, this set's ability to lure and remove or heavily chip them makes Explosion even more scary.</p> <p>96 Special Attack EVs guarantee that the combination of Hidden Power Fire and Meteor Mash will always KO Forretress under sunlight. 252 HP and 24 Defense EVs ensure Metagross's survival against two Shadow Balls from Choice Band Deoxys-A after one layer of Spikes. 116 Attack EVs with a positive nature guarantee Meteor Mash will OHKO bulkless Latios at +1, 2HKO Blissey, and 2HKO maximum HP Latias. A Brave nature is used instead of Adamant to avoid hindering the power of Hidden Power Fire; thankfully, the resulting drop in Speed only hurts Metagross against opposing Metagross and the occasional Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Groudon is mandatory alongside mixed Metagross, since its Drought summons the sunlight required for Hidden Power Fire to hit its damage benchmarks. Groudon itself also greatly benefits from this set's talents, as Skarmory is usually a significant thorn in its side. Ho-Oh is another great Pokemon under sun that can also bring the pain to Kyogre switch-ins with Thunder or a Choice Band set; it even checks Jirachi, Bulk Up Mewtwo, and opposing Metagross, giving it considerable defensive synergy. Choice Band Deoxys-A loves this Metagross acting as a Steel-type lure, letting it spam Shadow Ball with reckless abandon. Latios is always a welcome teammate for Metagross, and on sun teams it provides much-needed insurance against Kyogre. Chlorophyll sweepers also enjoy anti-Steel-type measures that keep them from having to run Hidden Power Fire themselves; this is especially true for Exeggutor, which, much like Metagross, hates Skarmory and Forretress switching into its Explosion.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Metagross has an excellent STAB move in Meteor Mash, solid coverage, and plenty of resistances it can leverage to get on the field, which combine to give it one of the scariest Choice Band sets in the game. A Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash is hilariously strong, shredding through Latios and Mewtwo in a single hit and 2HKOing every other neutral target except Lugia; even bulky Pokemon that might otherwise be safe from Metagross's assaults, such as Deoxys-D, are not safe from this monster. A Steel resistance doesn't guarantee safety, either, as Earthquake will reduce Magneton to atoms while OHKOing Jirachi and 2HKOing most Kyogre if Spikes are on the field. Pursuit still lets Metagross act as a solid Deoxys-A trapper despite the lack of Leftovers and reduced bulk investment, although those factors make it more difficult to use in the role without sacrificing a Pokemon first. If Pursuit isn't needed, Rock Slide is a great alternative that hammers Ho-Oh and provides a slightly more accurate option against Rayquaza, Salamence, and Skarmory. Finally, Explosion is upgraded from a nuke to an orbital bombardment with a Choice Band equipped, wiping basically anything not named Gengar or Dusclops off the face of the earth. Even Lugia and Forretress, the only two Pokemon capable of withstanding Choice Band Metagross's other attacks, are felled by Explosion, making the set truly unwallable with proper play.</p> <p>The given EV spread is the simplest and most reliable: maximum Attack and HP investment lets Metagross hit as hard as possible while still retaining defensive utility against the likes of Snorlax, Latios, Deoxys-A, and several other threats. However, maximum Speed investment can also be quite useful, since it means that Groudon, Kyogre, and Deoxys-D are not only unable to switch into a Choice Band Metagross that predicts them, but they also won't be able to fire off a powerful attack before being KOed, or in Deoxys-D's case, stall for time with Recover. Jirachi and slower variants of Rayquaza can be caught out by this as well, and if Metagross is running Rock Slide, this also completely turns the tables on most Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Metagross makes a great addition to offensive teams that enjoy its brutal, immediate progress-making ability; such teams usually play at a pace that negates this set's lowered resilience on the defensive side. These teams benefit from aggressively overloading the defensive pieces of the opposing team and seizing early momentum, which can be accomplished by a threatening Explosion lead such as Mew or Mewtwo. Since Choice Band Metagross has a tendency to shred through some Pokemon that might solidly check its other sets, such as Groudon, the range of offensive teammates it can work with is very wide; however, Magneton is still a great asset to it, since Metagross still can't reliably deal with Skarmory and Forretress without sacrificing itself. Pokemon that take advantage of Ho-Oh and Lugia are also important, especially since Metagross has a tendency to lock itself into moves that give Ho-Oh free turns; Calm Mind Latios has an excellent matchup against both Pokemon, especially if it uses Thunder alongside Kyogre to hit them as hard as possible. If you'd prefer to run a Latios set that can't fit Thunder, or the team is using Groudon but not Kyogre, Substitute + Calm Mind Mewtwo is another great win condition that similarly helps Metagross against its checks. Gengar can shut down Lugia with its classic Taunt + Will-O-Wisp combination while also blocking Forretress's attempts to remove Spikes with Rapid Spin. Aerodactyl is a formidable late-game wincon that dominates Ho-Oh and can work with Metagross to break down their shared checks; it also appreciates Metagross trapping one of its few reliable revenge killers in Deoxys-A. Curse Snorlax is a formidable endgame threat that appreciates Metagross's ability to remove or severely weaken Groudon, Lugia, and Steel-types; Snorlax can also run a Choice Band set of its own to maximize wallbreaking power, but this often makes the team unacceptably weak to special threats like Latios and Mewtwo.</p>"
        },
        "Agility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Agility gives Metagross the Speed advantage it needs to clean up games, letting it outrun the entire unboosted metagame after a single turn of setup and clobber weakened teams with Meteor Mash. Metagross's Steel typing affords it a resistance to the most common priority moves in Ubers, namely Extreme Speed from Deoxys-A and Rayquaza; this gives it a key advantage over other fast setup sweepers, such as Rayquaza itself as well as Mewtwo and Salac Berry Groudon and Kyogre. Explosion is retained on this set so that Metagross can still deal excellent damage in the event it is unable to clean by itself. Earthquake lets Metagross function as a team's main sweeper, letting it blow past Meteor Mash switch-ins such as Jirachi, Magneton, Qwilfish, and weakened Kyogre. Rock Slide is a coverage option that specifically invalidates Ho-Oh as a check, although this is more of a specific tech compared to Earthquake.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Metagross hit exactly 400 Speed after using Agility, outpacing neutral-natured Deoxys-A by a single point. Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature are necessary, since Metagross has no way of reliably boosting its Attack stat further. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to preserve as much of Metagross's bulk as possible, ensuring it's still a decent answer to Snorlax and neutral-natured Deoxys-A. Leftovers are the default item to give Metagross as much staying power as possible, but Lum Berry can be a lifesaver against Pokemon that can take a hit from Metagross and cripple it with paralysis, such as Thunder Wave variants of Groudon and Blissey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Agility Metagross works best on offensive builds that use multiple strong win conditions that synergize with it. As a faster sweeper that relies on Speed to clean up teams, Metagross particularly needs help against stall cores that rely more on bulk than Speed; such teams commonly check it with Skarmory, Forretress, or Lugia, so it's preferable to have a teammate which deals with these. Calm Mind Latios is a great candidate, as it boasts perfect defensive synergy with Metagross and easily overwhelms its checks with boosted Thunder. Substitute + Calm Mind Kyogre is similarly effective, and it also provides rain to help Metagross's team against Ho-Oh as well as Fire coverage from Mewtwo and Deoxys-A. Magneton is also a reliable way of clearing out Steel-types for Metagross's benefit, but such a build would require a different solution against Lugia; again, Latios and Kyogre are both easy to recommend, as are dedicated stallbreakers such as Taunt + Toxic Mewtwo. Spikes are extremely useful for weakening checks such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Forretress into range of Metagross's attacks; Forretress, Deoxys-D, and Skarmory are all serviceable in this role. Forretress also supports Metagross with Rapid Spin, Deoxys-D piles on the passive damage with Toxic and Knock Off, and Skarmory amplifies the effects of Spikes with Whirlwind. Since Agility Metagross is unable to fit Pursuit, an alternative Deoxys-A check is extremely important; Rayquaza is a great candidate for this thanks to its access to Extreme Speed and resistance to Superpower, and it can shred holes in bulkier teams with a Dragon Dance or Choice Band set.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Metagross offers a unique and fantastic mixture of power and versatility to ADV. It is a staple of many iterations of offense, with access to the devastating Explosion and the ability to draw in many of its best targets. Metagross goes far beyond just blowing itself up, though; it is a truly multi-faceted creature. Whether generating early aggression with Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mashes, pivoting into resisted Rock Slides mid-game, or cleaning weakened teams with a well-timed Agility, this cosmic colossus is a force to be reckoned with.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metagross can hold a Salac Berry with a Jolly nature and Endure on a set that works similarly to its Agility build. This circumvents the requirement for a turn of vulnerability when it would usually set up Agility, finding particular efficacy against Dugtrio and +1 Dragon Dance Tyranitar, which it outspeeds after its boost. However, Salac Berry Metagross is still slower than Aerodactyl and Jolteon at +1. Psych Up is an interesting choice for combating CurseLax. However, the necessity for tankiness on this type of set leaves it too slow to theoretically copy a Dragon Dance boost from Tyranitar and then outspeed it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The most ubiquitous and important Metagross counter is Swampert. Its Steel resistance and great defensive stats allow it to soak up Meteor Mashes and return damage with Earthquake. Swampert's love affair with Protect forces Metagross users to be wary of attempting an Explosion against it—the preferred strategy is often to predict a Swampert switch and use Explosion then as opposed to doing so when actually facing it. Other Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can also absorb Meteor Mashes but are far more vulnerable to Explosion. Zapdos is a handy offensive check to Metagross, often staring it down from the lead. Zapdos must avoid Choice Band-boosted Rock Slide, though, which comes a damage roll away from OHKOing its offensive variant. Gyarados and Moltres are similar to Zapdos in this fashion; they resist Meteor Mash and are Earthquake immune but must care for Rock Slide. Skarmory can lay Spikes against Metagross well and use Protect to recover damage dealt. It too folds to Choice Band-boosted Explosion, however. Metagross can be removed by both the tier's trappers, Dugtrio and Magneton, from a certain range. When preparing to trap Metagross with either one of these, one should employ the information given by Metagross's set to estimate the amount of bulk on its spread and thus the safe range to pick it off from. Magneton can also switch into a Choice-locked Meteor Mash with its double resistance to Steel and comfortably 2HKO Metagross too.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Metagross is the single best source of immediate offense in the tier. Its STAB Meteor Mash backed by base 135 Attack and a Choice Band is freakishly powerful. Metagross is often able to muscle even past targets that resist it such as Skarmory with this move, in particular if a fortuitous Attack raise should occur. Explosion is an incredible tool for splitting defensive cores open, OHKOing everything bar Gengar. Earthquake provides fine coverage, striking opposing Metagross and Jirachi, as well as offering an acceptable neutral hit against Swampert and Suicune. Rock Slide is the foremost choice in the fourth slot, as it targets Zapdos and Moltres. Hidden Power Bug sees use as a countermeasure to defensive Celebi, punishing it for staying in and using Leech Seed on Metagross. Double-Edge is a fine option over either of these for a hard neutral hit that simultaneously covers Water-types and Zapdos.</p> <p>The EVs allow Metagross to maximize its damage output and guarantee a KO on Skarmory with Explosion. 128 HP EVs ensure that Metagross survives Jolly Dugtrio's Earthquake from full health and covers MixMence's Fire Blast well too. The Speed makes Metagross just faster than minimum Speed Suicune. Metagross can use a spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe to outrun maximum Speed neutral-natured Tyranitar and Swampert. An alternate spread of 184 HP / 252 Atk / 72 Spe, which always survives an Earthquake from +1 Metagross or Salamence, is another possibility. If your team relies solely on Metagross for switching into Rock Slides, you may wish to consider a bulkier spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe to provide cushioning against Tyranitar and Aerodactyl. It is worth noting that these bulk benchmarks, while well intended, lose their efficacy if Metagross switches into just a resisted Body Slam or Rock Slide or even a layer of Spikes. Lacking Leftovers severely damages Choice Band Metagross's longevity, so a proactive approach with your Explosion early on is often advisable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is particularly potent when leading on an offensively inclined team. A blind turn 1 Explosion against a favorable lead matchup such as Tyranitar can be game breaking in its ability to blow a major roadblock away when it catches a Skarmory or Swampert on the switch. Dragon Dance users such as Tyranitar and Salamence appreciate Metagross's ability to tear down walls, creating a juncture for them to sweep in the later phases of the game. Snorlax pairs well with this set, being able to tank early hits from Zapdos and Suicune and keep up offensive momentum. When played aggressively, this Metagross is likely to take substantial damage or be KOed early, so a secondary Rock-type answer such as Swampert is appreciated for safety against the physical armada. Swampert's pivoting ability is also excellent for getting Metagross into play repeatedly. Zapdos, another purveyor of offense, has good type synergy with Metagross and can switch into Skarmory and Water-types well. Zapdos is also able to shut down opposing Zapdos with Thunder Wave in lead mirrors, reducing its capability to threaten Metagross.</p>"
        },
        "Agility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Unlike other Metagross sets that see the majority of their action early, this configuration is designed for late-game and sweeping. Its immunity to sand and Toxic negates the strategies that damage the efficacy of other Speed boosters like Dragon Dance Salamence and also avoid forcing it to hold Leftovers. Once its counters are weakened or removed, Metagross can use Agility to take its Speed to 396, beating out every unboosted Pokemon. From there, its usual Meteor Mash and Earthquake wipe through a carefully weakened enemy team. Explosion is the favored choice in the final slot on this set, as the opportunity will not always present itself for Metagross to sweep. Your judgement of the game situation should indicate whether Metagross must be relegated to a luring and wall removal role. For example, if you have been unable to weaken your opponent's conservatively played Swampert, it is unwise to keep Metagross alive and withheld in an effort to facilitate its sweep—instead, look to use Explosion. For more one-dimensional teams that rely less on gameplan flexibility, Rock Slide is available over Explosion to cover Zapdos and Moltres.</p> <p>Lum Berry opens up many otherwise unavailable setup opportunities, shielding Metagross for a turn against Gengar's Will-O-Wisp and Blissey's Thunder Wave. Opting for Leftovers improves Metagross's longevity and ability to switch into attacks once or twice earlier on. Liechi Berry is a more niche item option; combined with Substitute to reach activation range, it allows Metagross to boost its Attack without hoping for Meteor Mash's chance to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Agility Metagross is the set that most appreciates Clear Body, negating the issues with Intimidate pivoting often faced by other boosters. This ability to avoid Attack drops contributes to its value as the perfect receiver for Baton Pass Celebi's Swords Dance boosts. Performing this combination successfully is extremely threatening. Magneton is a requirement on most Agility Metagross teams, as Skarmory's ability to safely wall Metagross and Whirlwind it away hinders its potency. Metagross also benefits from the support of mixed attackers such as Tyranitar and Salamence due to their ability to lure in Swampert and cripple it with Hidden Power Grass.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>An often overlooked strength of Metagross is its base 130 Defense, which is supported by a valuable defensive typing that grants it sand and Toxic immunity along with a fine selection of resistances. This set offers a different dimension to Metagross, bolstering its role as a mid-game pivot and check to physical attackers while still enabling it to output respectable damage with Meteor Mash and Earthquake. Protect facilitates this strategy as a superb and multifaceted move that provides free recovery through the game and scouts Choice Band users such as Metagross, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar. The aggressive Explosion remains a fixture on this balanced set, as Metagross retains its role of removing bulky Water-types to support its offensive teammates. Explosion also sees use to remove a boosted CurseLax in a pinch. Toxic is a possible option over Explosion, but heavy use of Refresh on Water-types such as Milotic and Swampert invalidates its greatest niche. It is still valued against Zapdos, Moltres, and the lesser seen non-Rest Suicune, though. Hidden Power Grass is usable, most likely over Protect; however, it requires some investment to 2HKO Swampert, its main target.</p> <p>This Metagross set suffers from letting Moltres enter freely, a particularly dangerous prospect because the Magneton balance teams it often features on hate Moltres's Will-O-Wisps and Fire Blasts. Replacing Protect with Rock Slide turns this weakness on its head, catching the Moltres switching in with a crushing OHKO. Rock Slide also deals respectable damage to Zapdos, comfortably 2HKOing it.</p> <p>The EV spread is heavily favored to survive two Earthquakes from Jolly Tyranitar and is guaranteed to do so if you risk Protect on a possible Dragon Dance. Its Dugtrio survival chances are also aided, being able to do so even after stepping on three Spikes and using Protect right after. Metagross still requires attacking investment to threaten Snorlax and pressure its switch-ins. On teams with unreliable physical walling, in particular those lacking a traditional bulky Water-type, Metagross can invest more in Defense and use an Impish nature for greater safety against the likes of Dragon Dance Salamence and Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tank Metagross appreciates Magneton, as it cannot punish Skarmory by itself. This set is best suited to a Magneton-aided balance or offense team, in which its typical partners in Salamence and Gyarados are found. Metagross combines with either of these two Intimidate users to generate a formidable balance core with excellent type synergy. Metagross appreciates their Ground immunities and Fire resistances and reciprocates the favor with Rock and Ice resistances. Celebi combines with Metagross excellently, being able to freely switch into Water-types all game and potentially even support it with Heal Bell to remove paralysis from Snorlax, Jirachi, and Blissey and burns from Gengar.</p>"

        "Mixed": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mixed Metagross is a balanced set, a jack-of-all-trades designed to fill a void left on many specially inclined or mixed offense teams. STAB Psychic from a well-invested Special Attack stat dominates Gengar, and Metagross does not fear its usual Will-O-Wisp. The move also makes for a respectable neutral hit on Swampert and offensive Zapdos. Hidden Power Fire weakens Skarmory, which will often willingly tank multiple hits from Metagross in exchange for the opportunity to lay Spikes. It offers an improvement over Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash, which is otherwise Metagross's best means of damaging Skarmory while staying alive, due to Metagross's ability to switch moves and gain Leftovers recovery. It also eliminates the possibility of a pivot from Skarmory to Magneton from the opponent, which would usually comfortably trap and pick off a Metagross locked into Meteor Mash. Hidden Power Fire also dominates Forretress, which often sees Metagross as an opening to set up Spikes. The combination of Thunder Punch and Hidden Power Grass can replace Psychic and Hidden Power Fire on teams that profit from weakening Swampert. Thunder Punch retains the ability to strike Skarmory that the loss of Hidden Power Fire would otherwise sacrifice. This configuration of mixed Metagross also often uses Earthquake in lieu of Meteor Mash, OHKOing Magneton and hitting Jirachi and opposing Metagross harder. However, losing Meteor Mash makes Snorlax and Blissey more difficult to deal with, often pressuring you to use Explosion earlier than what is ideal. Mixed Metagross without Meteor Mash also has to use Explosion to OHKO Dugtrio.</p> <p>This set is typically selected on teams that would like to have Jirachi in a vacuum but fear Tyranitar, Blissey, and Snorlax too much to justify its use. Unlike Jirachi, Metagross has Steel STAB and Explosion available to it. Meteor Mash disallows Tyranitar's Dragon Dance setup and is also mixed Metagross's only way to OHKO Dugtrio while staying alive itself. The threat of Explosion forces Blissey and Snorlax to switch out. Explosion can be replaced with Pursuit on teams where Gengar removal is crucial, but this choice is often inadvisable, as multiple successful Pursuits are required to KO Gengar, which can wear Metagross down through the game's course with Fire Punch, Will-O-Wisp, and Spikes damage.</p> <p>Maximized Special Attack is required for the greatest possible damage output against Gengar and Skarmory, a necessity in the era of specially defensive Gengar. 252 HP EVs help Metagross switch into Gengar's Thunderbolts and Aerodactyl's Rock Slides alike. However, on teams without Tyranitar that particularly fear CurseLax, greater Attack investment in place of this HP is appreciated for a more powerful Explosion against this boosted target.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The loss of Earthquake compromises Metagross's ability to check Jirachi and duel other Metagross. Dugtrio is a fantastic partner to Metagross, as it can mitigate this loss by trapping these Pokemon. Dugtrio also fits well supporting the special offenses that often elect to use this Metagross, picking off weakened Blissey and Snorlax to open up Suicune or Celebi. Celebi is also able to Baton Pass Calm Mind boosts to Metagross, which is an often effective mid-game receiver due to its physical threat to typical special walls.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>With Soul Dew, Latias is a versatile Pokemon offensively and defensively. Its typing, Levitate, and good Speed let it check Kyogre and Groudon, the strongest attackers in the tier, while avoiding Spikes damage. Latias can also answer many special attackers thanks to Soul Dew's Special Defense boost. Unfortunately for Latias, its typing leaves it weak to common Ice- and Ghost-type attacks. It also dislikes status, especially paralysis, even on sets with Refresh. Finally, Latias is often outclassed by Latios, which boasts a higher Special Attack stat to immediately pressure foes more. Nevertheless, Latias is a better Calm Mind sweeper and a more consistent check to aforementioned threats, as its bulk gives it more resilience to a critical hit or full paralysis turn. Generally, Latias is only worth a teamslot over Latios on bulky teams that need its long-term efficacy or a wincon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Running Thunderbolt over Thunder on sun-based teams may seem appealing, but the loss of damage output against Ho-Oh and Kyogre is significant, generally causing Latias to lose the latter matchup while not meaningfully improving the former. Roar is an interesting option with a couple of purposes. On the Calm Mind set, it can be used to set up against an opposing Calm Mind user that would otherwise beat it and phaze the foe afterwards, gaining a significant advantage. On the BoltBeam set, it can be used as insurance against Calm Mind users that can set up to take on Latias. On both sets, Roar is also general insurance against setup Pokemon that can threaten the bulkier teams on which Latias naturally fits. Dropping a move for Roar is difficult, however; the most plausible option is Refresh, which will leave Latias much weaker against status from Groudon, Kyogre, and Blissey. Safeguard is an option over Refresh, but it's unable to prevent Latias from taking status while switching in, which broadly makes it a much less desirable option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey's incredible special bulk can generally take on Latias indefinitely. However, the Calm Mind set can defeat most Blissey, although there are specialized Blissey sets that can beat this Latias set with Snatch, Psych Up, or Calm Mind. Even standard Blissey can force Latias to use Recover or Refresh, allowing an offensive answer such as Deoxys-A to switch in. Snorlax can take Latias's attacks and hit hard back with Shadow Ball or Body Slam, threaten a Body Slam paralysis, or even set up Curse. Deoxys-D can switch in and threaten to remove Soul Dew with Knock Off or set up Spikes. +6 Latias can overpower it even lacking Soul Dew, although a faster Deoxys-D with Taunt can prevent it from boosting. Ho-Oh's massive Special Defense and Recover allow it to take most of Latias's attacks comfortably and hit back hard with Shadow Ball; however, offensive Ho-Oh fears Thunder in rain, and defensive Ho-Oh may not be able to do sufficient damage to prevent a physically defensive Latias from setting up. Jirachi can usually beat Latias thanks to its bulk and resistances to Ice and Dragon. Jirachi can paralyze Latias with Body Slam, Thunder, or Thunder Wave, hit it hard with Shadow Ball, or set up on it with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Checks</strong>: Deoxys-A can heavily damage Latias, but it will be OHKOed by any of Latias's attacks and cannot guarantee an OHKO on even non-physically defensive Latias without a Choice Band. Metagross can switch into Dragon Claw or Ice Beam and threaten to hit Latias hard or use Explosion. Heracross can also usually check Latias, surviving even a +1 Dragon Claw and threatening to KO it back with Megahorn given minimal chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind Kyogre will usually beat Calm Mind Latias one-on-one, and even Thunder Latias will be hard-pressed as it cannot 2HKO Kyogre if Latias switches in as Kyogre uses Calm Mind. Groudon can generate a free turn by forcing Latias to use Refresh as it switches into Thunder Wave multiple times, eventually resulting in a full paralysis, using the opportunity to set up a Swords Dance and then usually OHKO Latias with +2 Hidden Power Ghost.</p> <p><strong>Niche Checks</strong>: Umbreon can take a couple attacks from Latias, trap it with Mean Look, and pivot with Baton Pass to a counter; Regice can take multiple hits with its massive Special Defense stat and retaliate with Explosion or STAB Ice Beam; Registeel has incredible special bulk and a fantastic typing, using Latias to set up with Curse or removing it with Explosion; Steelix can switch into Dragon Claw and Thunder to hit Latias hard; and Shedinja takes no damage whatsoever from any of Latias's attacks barring the obscure Hidden Power Fire and retaliates with STAB Shadow Ball. None of these Pokemon are generally recommended, however.</p>",

        "BoltBeam": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set primarily acts as a check to powerful Pokemon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Latios. Refresh helps Latias consistently check threats, but Latias should still avoid status, as a full paralysis will severely hinder it. Recover lets Latias take multiple hits from super effective coverage moves, mainly Kyogre's Ice Beam and Groudon's Hidden Power Ghost. Thunder and Ice Beam hit Kyogre, Groudon, and Latios super effectively and almost the entire tier for at least neutral damage. 140 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Latias outspeed Modest Latios and any unboosted Groudon or Kyogre. 252 HP leverages its advantage in bulk over Latios.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is an option over Ice Beam, trading power against Groudon for extra damage against Latios; this is best for teams that already have significant Groudon countermeasures. It is also possible to use Calm Mind over Refresh for Latias to double as a wincon, but this will hamper its matchup against Thunder Wave variants of Groudon and Kyogre, and Latias will still lose to Blissey. Dropping Refresh generally requires a Blissey on one's team to heal status and counter Thunder Wave Kyogre. Furthermore, if opting for Dragon Claw over Ice Beam, one can switch Latias's Special Attack and HP investments to use it as a lead. With this spread, Latias can 2HKO Mewtwo and has enough bulk to take two Ice Beams from Mewtwo, forcing it to use Self-Destruct. However, Calm Mind variants of Mewtwo can use Latias as setup fodder. Finally, a spread of 192 HP / 176 SpA / 140 Spe with a Timid nature retains the ability to survive Spell Tag Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball from full health and hits foes harder, but this spread particularly is often outclassed by Latios, which can survive the same hit with more offensive presence.</p> <p>This set's biggest flaw is that it suffers in comparison to Latios. Latios's significantly higher offensive presence pressures Groudon and Kyogre much more effectively, most notably securing the 2HKO on Kyogre even when switching in on its Calm Mind. As such, careful thought should be given if Latias's bulk is needed over Latios's power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although a good check to Groudon and Kyogre, Latias should not be the sole check to either threat. If SubSalac Groudon can find a turn to set up, including from full paralysis, it can OHKO Latias with +2 Hidden Power Ghost. Therefore, another check to Groudon such as Lugia or Ho-Oh is necessary. Similarly, it is generally wise to have a backup check to opposing Kyogre, such as a Blissey or your own Kyogre with Thunder.</p> <p>Pokemon that commonly switch into Latias include Snorlax, Blissey, and Ho-Oh. The former two can generally be handled with a Steel-type that can set up Spikes, such as Skarmory or Forretress, or hit hard physically, such as Metagross. Ho-Oh is checked by physical walls that are not overly concerned with sun-boosted Sacred Fire or burn, such as a Lugia backed up by cleric Blissey or a physically defensive Ho-Oh of one's own.</p>"

        "Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The set acts as a wincon that can beat Blissey with Recover, Refresh, and Calm Mind. Calm Mind allows Latias to overwhelm its defensive answers and clean a weakened team; Dragon Claw is a powerful STAB attack alongside it with few sturdy resistant foes. Refresh cleanses Toxic from Blissey and paralysis from Groudon's and Kyogre's Thunder Wave, and possibly Snorlax's Body Slam. Another option is using Reflect over Refresh, making this Latias much more effective at checking and setting up on physical attackers.  The given HP and Defense EVs complement Latias's extraordinary Special Defense, especially with Calm Mind, and help it take attacks from weaker physical attackers such as uninvested Ho-Oh. They also let Latias take Choice Band Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball from full health. The Speed investment is important to beat neutral base 90s, namely Kyogre and Groudon.</p> <p>252 HP / 116 Def / 140 Spe with a Timid nature lets Latias outspeed Modest Latios at the cost of being weaker to physical attackers. It is also possible to use a spread of 172 HP / 240 Def / 96 Spe, retaining the Bold nature, to still outspeed most Groudon and Kyogre while tanking Groudon's +2 Hidden Power Ghost, allowing it to act as a backup check to SubSalac Groudon; this will cut into Latias's special bulk noticeably, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is somewhat self-sufficient, being able to beat most of Latias's defensive answers, namely Blissey, Ho-Oh without significant Attack investment, and some Snorlax lacking Curse and Shadow Ball. Although Latias can take a hit from Deoxys-A, it is prone to chip damage and cannot afford to spam Recover. Therefore, checks to these threats, often a Steel-type like Metagross or Forretress, are necessary. Pokemon like Groudon and Kyogre can check Steel-types that can use Latias as fodder, like Spikes Forretress, Calm Mind Jirachi, and Metagross. Furthermore, as this set is less effective at taking on opposing Groudon and Kyogre, other answers to those are important, such as a Lugia + Blissey core.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Latios is the premier check to Groudon and Kyogre, the two most threatening and important Pokemon in the tier, making it nigh impossible for teams to pass; unless they run Latias instead. Latios is also a top offensive threat itself; Soul Dew effectively gives it a Calm Mind boost, and it is faster than the majority of Pokemon in the tier. Its immunity to Ground and Spikes and resistances to Fighting and Electric are important defensive qualities, increasing Latios's versatility and capacity to come into play. Latios is especially potent with rain support, as its powerful Thunder either heavily damages many of its checks or inconveniences them with its high paralysis rate. Latios is, however, a victim of its own reputation and influence; its prevalence as a key threat forces many teams to explicitly prepare for Latios, denying its standard sets from making substantial progress against them, especially through the use of Blissey and sun. Also, Latios's poor physical bulk means the likes of Deoxys-A, Salac Berry Groudon, and Extreme Speed Rayquaza can revenge kill or sweep through it quite effectively. Latios is also vulnerable to losing Speed ties and Calm Mind wars in some late-game scenarios.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Dragon Dance set with Hidden Power Fighting and coverage moves like Ice Beam, Thunder, Shadow Ball, and Earthquake salvage Latios's workable Attack stat to break through Blissey and Snorlax, its two most common and effective checks. The set requires maximum Attack investment with Soul Dew along with 156 Speed EVs, alongside support from strong Kyogre and Groudon checks. Substitute can be used to block incoming status and scout between several potential switch-ins to maximize damage. Mono-attack Latios with Calm Mind and Dragon Claw could potentially be used, but it is largely outclassed by Latias, which has better defensive stats. Toxic and Thunder Wave can disrupt a few of Latios's common responses, but they are mostly less useful than other utility or offensive moves. Latios could potentially utilize Protect to scout Choice Band users, which commonly target it, but it is otherwise a mostly useless move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Except against Dragon Dance sets, Blissey is a common and fairly secure check to Latios, comfortably tanking Latios's attacks with its massive special bulk and forcing it out with Calm Mind + Ice Beam or Toxic + Seismic Toss. Latios can comfortably click Refresh or Recover before deciding how to punish Blissey with a switch; however, chip damage makes it easier to break through Latios with another Pokemon later. Further, Blissey may run moves such as Snatch and Light Screen to prevent Latios from doing this as well.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Although its special bulk isn't as solid as Blissey's, Snorlax is more than capable of tanking Latios's strongest attacks and threatening it with a powerful Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: While it gets hit hard by Thunder, Ho-Oh is a fairly effective Latios check in sun that can threaten Latios with status or powerful physical attacks such as Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Flying.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross takes heavy damage from Thunder or Hidden Power Fire in sun, but it can switch into Dragon Claw and Ice Beam and can threaten Latios with its strong physical attacks. Similar to Metagross but less potent, Forretress can still force Latios out with the threat of Explosion, Hidden Power Bug, or freely setting or removing Spikes. More niche Steel-types like Jirachi, Steelix, Registeel, and Magneton can soft check Latios due to their resistances. Jirachi can set up with Calm Mind against Latios or use Wish to stall and smack it with Body Slam or Shadow Ball; Steelix is immune to Electric-type attacks and can hit back with strong physical moves; Registeel can set up with Amnesia or threaten Latios with Hidden Power Ghost and Explosion; and Magneton scares Latios out with status.</p> <p><strong>Deoxys-D</strong>: Although it takes some damage from Thunder and Dragon Claw, Deoxys-D is generally not worth trading Latios for, forcing Latios out and allowing Deoxys-D to set Spikes or punish the switch with Knock Off or status.</p> <p><strong>Regice</strong>: Regice has enough special bulk to tank a few of Latios's attacks and can hit back with Ice Beam or Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Shedinja is immune to most Latios, but it is KOed by Hidden Power Fire and Shadow Ball sets.</p> <p><strong>Swampert</strong>: Swampert has decent bulk, is immune to Thunder, and can hit Latios with a fairly strong Hidden Power Ghost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, Dragon Claw Latios and Latias, Choice Band Lugia, Choice Band Aerodactyl, and Salac Berry Heracross have the Speed and power to outspeed, or at very least Speed tie, and KO Latios.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover is essential for allowing Latios to check Groudon and Kyogre throughout the game. Refresh allows Latios to remove paralysis and regain its important Speed advantage;Thunder Wave is commonly used by Groudon and Kyogre. Calm Mind can be used to help Latios break through several defensive Pokemon such as Metagross and Ho-Oh. Thunder hits Kyogre for maximum damage, and with rain support, it does well against Ho-Oh, Snorlax, and Steel-types. Thunderbolt is substantially weaker but still hits Kyogre fairly hard and allows Latios to maintain BoltBeam coverage when used on a sun team. Ice Beam hits Groudon hard and covers many foes with Thunder or Thunderbolt. Dragon Claw gives up some damage against Groudon, but it still hits opposing Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza while hitting Snorlax acceptably without having to rely on Thunder and rain. Maximum Special Attack EVs are essential for Latios to function as a strong check to Kyogre and Groudon; they are also important for dealing decent damage to Snorlax and Steel-types. 252 Speed EVs outspeed maximum Speed Rayquaza and Speed tie opposing Modest Latios or Latias. A Timid nature outspeeds Modest Latios and Latias and offensive Lugia, alongside a few other niche threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is versatile, fitting on most team archetypes, and it requires no specific support. Because this set invites in Blissey, it is important for teams to have strong Blissey checks, such as Snorlax, Forretress, and Metagross. The same goes for Snorlax, making good switch-ins to Snorlax such as Forretress, Metagross, Skarmory, Lugia, Gengar, and Dusclops essential. Trappers such as Magneton, Dugtrio, Umbreon, and Wobbuffet are highly effective at disrupting, trapping, and potentially removing some of its checks.

Hidden Power Fire instead lets Latios hit Shedinja and Steel-types such as Forretress, Metagross, and Jirachi hard under sun. An Electric-type attack is critical for hitting Kyogre, as well as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Skarmory, and Steel-types under rain. With Solar Beam and Dragon Claw, Latios maximizes damage output against Groudon and opposing Latios and Latias, so it has no need for Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because this set doesn't have great longevity against Kyogre and Groudon, it should be run on offensive teams with secondary Kyogre and Groudon checks such as Latias, Blissey, Lugia, and Kyogre.

Mixed attackers that can bait Blissey into getting KOed by Self-Destruct or Explosion such as Mewtwo and Regice are also good partners. Spikes from the likes of Forretress, Skarmory, Deoxys-D, Omastar, or Qwilfish helps chip Steel-types and Snorlax for Latios to later sweep through. Weather sweepers such as Omastar, Qwilfish, Exeggutor, and Kabutops are great for covering Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, and Aerodactyl, which are some of the only Pokemon capable of revenge killing Latios.</p>"

Otherwise, concentrate on Special Attack. If you really feel like it, with max HP and around 280 Defense, Kyogre can take a Swords Danced Groudon Earthquake. There are two main ways to do the Speed. If Kyogre is your lead, you'll most likely want to make it as slow as possible, perhaps even giving it a -Speed nature and 0 IVs. This is so that when you are up against starter Groudon, your weather can go after theirs, thus claiming priority, forcing a switch. Non-boosted Groudon will not OHKO Kyogre, while Kyogre OHKOes Groudon in the rain with any Water move. As Kyogre is already tied for slowest Uber (and all Pokemon used in Ubers slower than Kyogre are slower, regardless of EVs, for example, Blissey), Speed won't really change much.

Knowing that most physical sweepers are countered by Water Pokemon, you are going to have a tad of trouble killing this thing with a few Calm Minds under its belt. 101 HP Substitutes block Blissey and Deoxys-D while you Calm Mind up. It takes 3 Calm Minds to 2HKO Blissey, but watch out for Psych Up and Calm Mind on Blissey (only if it has Thunder).</p> <p>Kyogre is one of those Pokemon that has so much power that it can make use of stuff like the berries, unlike most Pokemon.

This Kyogre almost requires paralysis support, as Kyogre is slow, and taking hits is one thing you don't want to do. With paralysis, however, Kyogre can get in a hit before taking one, using a 150 power STAB rain boosted Water move. Water Spout does ~52% to Latios, letting Ice Beam finish it off. It can OHKO Groudon in the sun, and does 44% or so to most Uber Blissey, meaning that with a few layers of Spikes down or if they lack Special Defense, you 2HKO.</p>"},

It's best to open with Surf or Ice Beam, usually, unless you know your opponent's team enough to predict what they'll switch to, as this set does benefit a lot from that turn or two of surprise. However, even once they know what kind of Kyogre you have, many teams have a dickens of a time countering it anyway. Unlike Groudon, Kyogre resists Ice Beam, which is far more common than Thunder, and, thanks to its superior Special Defense, takes less from Thunder than Groudon does from Ice Beam. Kyogre's typing also allows it to come in on things like Meteor Mash.</p> <p>Surf and Ice Beam are to stop certain Pokemon from walling you. Surf hits Groudon in the rain with an OHKO, while Ice Beam is stronger in the sun. Ice Beam will OHKO Rayquaza, Surf hits Skarmory and Metagross. Rock Slide can be used to hit Rayquaza if you're using Surf, as well as Ho-Oh, but Sleep Talk makes Kyogre a perfect Exeggutor counter, and eliminates another weapon from Blissey's arsenal (Sing).

      "overview": "<p>Groudon is an excellent physical attacker with its base 150 Attack stat and STAB Earthquake. However, Ice Beam is quite possibly the most common attack in Ubers, and Groudon, being slow, has trouble switching into a lot of things. If you can take Lugia down, though, this makes a good stallbreaker. It can support Sunny Day-style teams with its ability, but Solar Beam isn't that good in Ubers, and Fire isn't particularly good, either. Still, nothing likes switching into its Earthquakes, and it can OHKO those things immune to them with a Choice Band attack for the most part.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can be used to kill other Groudon and the common Choice Band Rayquaza, but Groudon and Rayquaza aren't really the most common switch-ins to Groudon. Groudon can use Substitute to block Knock Off and Toxic, as it cannot be broken by weaker physical attacks or Seismic Toss. Groudon can use Thunder Wave to paralyze Latias, Latios, and Lugia and then kill them with paralysis + flinch by pairing it with Rock Slide. Don't use Eruption; it's absolutely horrible.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For the Substitute versions, you will want 404 HP; it's nice for Blissey and Deoxys-D. Sweeping Groudon can have max Speed for the tie or win against Kyogre, which can help a lot. Another option is little-to-no Speed. Groudon is tied for slowest Uber in the game with Deoxys-D and Kyogre, and most Ubers like to hang out at 307 Speed, 1 above Groudon's maximum. If Groudon won't be beating them, why not just power up its Attack and defenses? You could run a very small amount of Speed to beat other Groudon and Kyogre that also have low Speed. For lead Groudon, you might want to be slower than lead Kyogre, so that your weather overwrites its, possibly even using Brave and lowering Speed IVs to 2 (with Hidden Power Bug) or 3 (With Hidden Power Ghost). Regardless of what you do, you will want a lot of Attack EVs unless you are running a stall set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Latias and Latios are immune to Earthquake, resist Fire, survive everything Groudon can throw at them save Choice Band Hidden Power Bug or Ghost, and can OHKO with Ice Beam (but Groudon with Special Defense EVs survives and can go for the 2HKO). Flygon works, but is very specific and won't do much to almost anything else, and it still needs Solar Beam to do anything to Groudon. Lugia can take hits all day with a Reflect up and can just Toxic stall Groudon to death, or it can alternate between Calm Mind and Recover before killing with Ice Beam. Exeggutor survives everything but Hidden Power Bug, Fire Blast, and Overheat, and OHKOes Groudon with Solar Beam (watch out for a Rayquaza switch-in to defend against this). Kyogre somewhat... you won't want to switch Kyogre into a Groudon Earthquake. If Groudon is faster and has a Swords Dance on the switch, Kyogre will get OHKOed, unless Kyogre has 404 HP (252 EVs) and 276 Defense (240 EVs).</p> <h3>Controlling the Weather</h3> <p><em>Leads</em></p> <p>In a match-up of Kyogre vs. Groudon, if both Pokemon are the first each battler sends out, the slower Pokemon will always control the weather.

Fire Blast can be used to avoid the Special Attack drop, but you almost never need it for multiple Pokemon on the enemy's team. Use Hidden Power Ghost with Overheat and Hidden Power Bug with Rock Slide generally, although you can use Overheat with Rock Slide if you want. Hidden Power Ghost fails to OHKO Exeggutor on the switch in, though, so beware of that. Other than that, however, Hidden Power Ghost and Hidden Power Bug both hit Latias and Latios equally hard. Hidden Power Ghost also hits Lugia, so Rock Slide isn't as useful. Rock Slide hits Rayquaza, Lugia, and Ho-Oh. For a single physical supplementary attack, however, Hidden Power Ghost is usually used over Rock Slide and Hidden Power Bug because it hits Latias, Latios, and Lugia. Ho-Oh is much less common than Latias, Latios, and Lugia, three of the most common Ubers, so you get better coverage with Overheat than with Rock Slide.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rayquaza can produce 101+ HP Substitutes, so that alone should allow you to think of some ways to deal with Blissey and Deoxys-D, which both make appearances in the uber metagame rather often. Psych Up is great for snatching some Calm Minds, but just be sure that what you're taking from doesn't have Ice Beam. It's not on any regular moveset because most things DO possess Ice Beam (or Rock Slide if you're trying to grab Swords Dances from Groudon). Bulk Up can make it easier to take physical hits from Groudon, Metagross and Dragon Dance Rayquaza while setting up, and is best used with Extreme Speed.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Choice Bander set needs maximum Attack. You could go for 280 Speed, which beats Kyogre / Groudon without a +Speed nature. 308 is an option with Jolly to beat their absolute maximum. Or alternately, go for the spread listed under the Choice Band set. The Special Rayquaza needs no Attack EVs, even when using Brick Break, just go for 216 in Speed, 40 HP and the rest in Special Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Special sweepers with Ice Beam. Rock Slide from Groudon can take on the less bulky Rayquaza, Latias and Latios can KO it, and survive most of its attacks, but has to be on its guard against Choice Banded or Dragon Danced Hidden Power Bug and Ghost. Skarmory completely walls Choice Banders without Overheat (and almost none have it). Lugia can set up a Reflect against it, Toxic it, and stall it out with Pressure and Recover, or just alternate Calm Mind and Recover until finally killing you with Ice Beam. Kyogre is a great counter, but Choice Banded Earthquake and Hidden Power Flying are a 2HKO, so it has to either outspeed it, or scare it into thinking it will outspeed it (won't work with Jolly Rayquaza). Alternately, a Kyogre with 252 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs takes 49% max damage from Adamant Choice Banded Earthquake (and it also defeats Swords Dance Groudon), so it's not as bad as it sounds, as long as you pack Ice Beam.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<p>What you may have noticed right away is that this has Hidden Power Bug / Ghost over Hidden Power Flying. This is because nothing takes more in Ubers from Hidden Power Flying than it does from Hidden Power Bug/Earthquake (well, after STAB, Hidden Power Flying is 105, Earthquake is only 100, but they're practically the same), but Hidden Power Bug and Ghost are super effective against a whole lot of the Psychic-based uber metagame. Choice Banded Hidden Power Bug hurts. Don't believe me? Here are some numbers:</p> <p>Latias and Latios are OHKOed without Defense or HP EVs (standard). In fact, Latias needs 240 HP EVs to have guaranteed survival. Latios is even worse off. If it wants to be certain of surviving a single hit, it needs not only 252 HP EVs, but an additional 72 Defense EVs.</p> <p>Another major difference between this and the old standard (252 Attack / 252 Speed, Adamant) is how much bulkier this is. The main reason is Exeggutor. Rayquaza makes a good switch-in to Exeggutor, because its ability means that it blocks sunlight, so Solar Beam takes two turns, and Chlorophyll is nullified. This means that if you switch in on a Solar Beam, you are faster and can OHKO it, while it can't do anything. This puts a powerful foe out of commission. The EVs are to let it survive max damage Modest Exeggutor Hidden Power Ice in case they guess what you're up to. This will also survive Choice Band Adamant Groudon / Rayquaza Rock Slide every time and can take 2 Choice Banded Rayquaza Extreme Speeds.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread can be used to make your Rayquaza fast. If you give it Jolly and max Speed, it is faster than all Groudon and Kyogre and also beats the few Latias and Latios remaining that just put in 307 Speed. Obviously, you'd want to max Attack as well.</p>"

        "Dragon Dance": {"description": "<p>This set is extremely rare in Ubers, as it can be difficult to set up Rayquaza (Ice Beam is the most common move). If you can bring it out on stuff like Choice Banded Earthquakes or Deoxys-A, you can Dragon Dance as they switch to whatever. Mewtwo falls just short of being KOed, so smack it around with an Earthquake or something the first time it comes in and then save it for later. Extreme Speed is used for Deoxys-A (allowing you to kill them without a Dragon Dance, or run a lot less Speed), in which case you'll want Hidden Power Ghost for Lugia. Rock Slide hits Lugia a bit harder, but the real benefit is to get Ho-Oh on its 4x weakness and a possible OHKO on other Rayquaza. Earthquake hits stuff like Metagross, Kyogre, and Groudon who aren't weak to your other moves.</p>"},
        "Special Attacker": {"description": "<p>Look familiar? This is like Salamence's special moveset, only with the addition of Thunderbolt. Surf is redundant, since Thunderbolt will kill Ho-Oh just as well, and Ice Beam takes care of Groudon. Crunch is for Psychic-types like Mewtwo and the Deoxys, while Dragon Claw makes good STAB and a nice choice for dealing with Latios / Latias switch-ins. Fire Blast can hurt Metagross a lot, while Brick Break owns Tyranitar and Blissey.</p> <p>Unlike Salamence's special set, this set is quite cool. It will kill almost any Groudon and enemy Rayquaza, and nearly 2HKO Kyogre. Dragon Claw is needed for the 2HKO on Latias, but Ice Beam will generally do the job against Latios (they can both skew these numbers by adding Special Defense EVs or HP).</p>"}

If you ever find something you can't deal with, Jirachi can just use Thunder and most likely paralyze it, or if you're feeling really lucky or desperate, it can Ice Punch and hope for the 20% freeze. Jirachi can beat Kyogre if it gets a free Calm Mind, too.</p>"}}},
    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Jirachi is an extremely versatile Pokemon thanks to its great stats, movepool, and typing. As a Calm Mind sweeper, it distinguishes itself from Suicune and Celebi by virtue of its part-Steel typing, which grants it immunity to passive damage from sand and Toxic and enables it to take advantage of Choice Band users such as Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar locked into their STAB attack more easily. Furthermore, Jirachi's colorful array of coverage moves makes it difficult to handle defensively, and its access to Wish can invalidate special sponges such as Blissey as answers while enhancing Jirachi's defensive capabilities. Jirachi also has some niche options at its disposal and can run physical sets to lure out and eliminate Pokemon that typically scare it out such as Tyranitar and Snorlax.</p> <p>On the other hand, Jirachi is held back by a very exploitable weakness to Earthquake, which makes it prone to being trapped and taken down by Dugtrio and allows metagame staples such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Swampert, Salamence, and Snorlax to potentially scare it off. While Jirachi has the needed coverage and support options to threaten all of these, it cannot fit each into a single set and thus will remain kept in check by some popular Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jirachi can also choose to go fully physical with a Choice Band and make use of its signature move in Doom Desire backed up by Hidden Power Fighting, Body Slam, and Shadow Ball. Doom Desire can hits targets with low physical bulk such as Blissey extremely hard regardless of its typing, whereas the remaining offensive options can take Pokemon like Celebi, Claydol, and Tyranitar by surprise. Nonetheless, the lack of Leftovers not only is detrimental to Jirachi's longevity but also can give a hint to the opponent, and in terms of raw power, Jirachi cannot compete with behemoths like Metagross.</p> <p>Lum Berry allows Jirachi to set up in front of Pokemon such as Zapdos, Magneton, Snorlax, Blissey, and Porygon2 without the fear of being paralyzed. It also prevents Breloom, Gengar, and, to a lesser extent, Milotic from putting it to sleep. Salac Berry is an option, as Jirachi can't be worn down by sand and is difficult to OHKO due to its great natural bulk, thus allowing it to survive most hits and gain a boost in Speed to hopefully sweep teams made of faster Pokemon, but the recovery provided by Leftovers is hard to give up, and such a strategy heavily relies on specific situations. Reflect can turn the tables in Jirachi's favor against strong Earthquake users, most notably Dugtrio, which might be forced out, but it can be played around and it's difficult to give up a precious moveslot. Hidden Power Water hits Tyranitar and Claydol super effectively while keeping a neutral hit against Steel-types. It also has the benefit of denting the uncommon Houndoom, which is a very threatening foe for most Jirachi variants. In a similar manner, Jirachi can use the weaker Water Pulse, which has the same coverage while also providing a decent chance to confuse the target thanks to Serene Grace. It can be used alongside Rain Dance and Thunder to maximize its effectiveness at dealing damage and pairs well with paralysis. Removing opposing sand with Rain Dance can also be very beneficial for teams with Pokemon like Suicune and Curse Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Perhaps the biggest pain for Jirachi to face, Dugtrio limits what Jirachi can accomplish throughout a match thanks to Arena Trap, its superior Speed, and its super effective Earthquake, which inflicts a huge amount of damage to Jirachi or outright OHKOes it. Nonetheless, Dugtrio can be defeated by bulky variants of Jirachi, which can potentially pull off a victory with two Body Slams aided by a paralysis or a Calm Mind-boosted hit backed up by Wish or a Substitute cover.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert is bulky enough to withstand several boosted Psychics and answer with a powerful Earthquake, but Hidden Power Grass invalidates it as a check. Refresh variants can also take on defensive Jirachi and can come up victorious even without Earthquake by PP stalling Jirachi. Claydol possesses even greater special bulk as well as a resistance to Psychic, allowing to take on most Jirachi's assaults easily. However, without EVs in Attack, it fails to 2HKO standard offensive Jirachi and to 3HKO the Wish + Calm Mind variant most of the time, which can break through it with Hidden Power Grass or Ice Punch. If Claydol lacks Refresh, it is also likely to lose to Toxic variants of defensive Jirachi. Flygon wants to avoid Ice Punch and possibly Psychic as well, but it can potentially outspeed and badly damage or OHKO Jirachi with Earthquake. While rare, Steelix is the bane of non-Fire Punch Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Thunder Wave Blissey handles offensive Calm Mind Jirachi fairly well but loses to the Wish + Calm Mind variant and has trouble against defensive and Substitute + Calm Mind variants. Perish Song Celebi shuts down any attempt to sweep from Jirachi and cripples it with Leech Seed, but without Perish Song, Jirachi can accumulate Calm Mind boosts and eventually break through Celebi's recovery. Substitute Jirachi in particular is a very tough foe for most variants of Celebi. As long as it packs Earthquake, Snorlax has the upper hand against most variants of Jirachi, but if sand is active, staying healthy becomes harder for Snorlax. Suicune can try to have a Calm Mind war with Jirachi and is likely to win if it has Roar to nullify Jirachi's boosts, but it may not have the luxury to do so if Jirachi packs an Electric-type move. Other phazers such as Tyranitar and Zapdos have the bulk to prevent Jirachi from sweeping at least once, but they usually will end up overpowered if they try to do so in the long run. Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar also have to watch out for Dynamic Punch from the mixed variant.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Earthquake</strong>: Tyranitar and Metagross, by virtue of their bulk and typing, naturally check most Jirachi variants and can scare them off with a powerful Earthquake. However, boosted Hidden Power Grass and Fire Punch inflict a noticeable amount of damage to both of these threats, and Tyranitar also needs to worry about Dynamic Punch. Aerodactyl outspeeds and can remove weakened Jirachi, but failing to eliminating it with Earthquake can lead to Aerodactyl's downfall if Jirachi manages to get a hit off, especially if it has Thunder or Thunderbolt. The same applies to Salamence, which is even more powerful but has to Speed tie with Jirachi most of the time and is taken out by Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Houndoom, while uncommon, can wall some Jirachi variants by virtue of its ability and typing and scare it off with a powerful Fire Blast. Moltres holds the merit of potentially OHKOing offensive Jirachi after a Calm Mind with Overheat and can outspeed Modest variants. Charizard can Speed tie with Jirachi and threatens it in a similar way. However, all of these are in trouble if Jirachi has several Calm Mind boosts under its belt, especially if it has either Thunder or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While trying to set up or recover, Jirachi might expose itself to Thunder Wave from Blissey, Zapdos, Magneton, and Porygon2; Body Slam from Snorlax; and Will-O-Wisp from Gengar. These effects hamper Jirachi's effectiveness significantly, as paralysis makes it slower than Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Swampert, and Heracross, which can pick off Jirachi more easily, whereas burn outdamages Leftovers recovery and reduces Jirachi's longevity.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Superachi (Offensive Calm Mind)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jirachi is one of the main Calm Mind sweepers in the metagame and can become an offensive powerhouse with this set. Calm Mind provides the needed boost in Special Attack to attempt a sweep, and the added increase in Special Defense enables Jirachi to potentially set up multiple times against the likes of Zapdos and Gengar. STAB Psychic OHKOes most Gengar variants, dents Heracross, and hits most neutral targets reasonably hard. Fire Punch OHKOes most Magneton variants after a Calm Mind and threatens Pokemon such as Metagross, Celebi, Skarmory, Forretress, and opposing Jirachi, which are all potentially troublesome. Boosted Hidden Power Grass takes out Swampert and hits Tyranitar, Starmie, and Ground-types such as Claydol hard. Ice Punch and Thunderbolt can be run over the two aforementioned coverage moves, since they complement each other very well and can drastically change some matchups in Jirachi's favor; Ice Punch OHKOes Salamence and most Flygon while keeping the ability to hit Celebi and Claydol super effectively, while Thunderbolt threatens Gyarados and Moltres with a potential OHKO after a Calm Mind, hits Skarmory harder than Fire Punch, and enhances Jirachi's chances of winning a Calm Mind war against Suicune. If having more than two of these coverage moves is desired, it is possible to drop Psychic, but keep in mind that this Jirachi variant typically wants to deal the greatest amount of damage it can as soon as possible.</p> <p>Jirachi sits at crowded Speed tier and wants maximum Speed to outrun the likes of Salamence, Zapdos, Flygon, Celebi, and Moltres if possible. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. Nonetheless, a Modest nature is an option, as it meets some notable benchmarks after a Calm Mind like a guaranteed 2HKO on Celebi with Fire Punch or Ice Punch, an OHKO on Moltres with Thunderbolt, a 2HKO on maximum HP Tyranitar and Claydol with Hidden Power Grass, and, most importantly, an OHKO with Ice Punch on most Dugtrio without any boost. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 40 Def / 152 SpA / 68 Spe with a Modest nature can be considered to ensure that Jirachi can stomach an Earthquake from Choice Band Dugtrio and +1 Tyranitar at full health while outspeeding maximum Speed Tyranitar, most Celebi, and some Suicune. 32 EVs in Speed is all you need to get the edge over maximum Speed Tyranitar, though, so you can drop some and invest more into Special Attack instead. Leftovers improves Jirachi's longevity and ability to enter the field throughout the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This variant of Jirachi has trouble getting past Thunder Wave Blissey. Thus, Dugtrio is a good partner to trap and eliminate it as well as other problematic Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Magneton; this is especially beneficial for Ice Punch + Thunderbolt variants, which tend to struggle against the aforementioned Pokemon. Conversely, Jirachi is prone to being removed if it gets trapped by Choice Band Dugtrio. Therefore, packing several targets of Dugtrio's coverage moves like Heracross and Celebi is a viable strategy when backed up by a Dugtrio of your own, as the opposing Dugtrio can be safely removed when locked into its weaker attacking moves, thus opening the field for Jirachi and its teammates. Similarly, while Porygon2 doesn't threaten Blissey, Tyranitar, and Metagross, it can trap and remove an opposing Dugtrio locked into any of its moves, which can be very useful if Jirachi's teammates are vulnerable to Earthquake as well. Having one or several Pokemon that can punish a Dugtrio locked into Earthquake such as Salamence, Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Gengar can prove to be beneficial. Pairing Jirachi with Explosion Gengar, Regice, or Weezing to lure Blissey in and damage it heavily is also a good idea, especially when backed up by Dugtrio to ensure Blissey's downfall. Heracross and Metagross also make good partners, as they can pivot in on and heavily pressure the likes of Blissey, Snorlax, and Celebi, which tend to be awkward for Jirachi to fight. Snorlax can also switch nicely into most Blissey and damage the likes of Tyranitar and Metagross with Self-Destruct, Earthquake, or Focus Punch. Another way to wear down the aforementioned foes is to set up Spikes with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Skarmory, one layer of which guarantees the 2HKO on Tyranitar with +1 Hidden Power Grass. Pokemon such as Roar or Baton Pass Zapdos, Jolteon, and Moltres can take advantage of Spikes to weaken Blissey and therefore make Jirachi more dangerous. Jirachi is also a good candidate for teams focused on Calm Mind alongside sweepers such as Celebi, Suicune, and, to a lesser extent, Raikou, as together they can play around and eventually overpower their shared foes.</p>"

        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jirachi is the only Steel-type in the game with a reliable recovery move in the form of Wish. This trait coupled with its solid bulk allows Jirachi to serve as a durable answer to specially offensive Pokemon such as Zapdos, non-Will-O-Wisp Gengar, Starmie, and Jolteon while also being able to pivot in on Choice Band users such as Salamence, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Aerodactyl, something that Blissey, the main special wall of the metagame, cannot do. Wish also enables Jirachi to heal its teammates, making it a strong team player. Protect makes Wish safer to use, scouts which move Choice Band users lock themselves into, and allows Jirachi to gain extra health from Leftovers, as the recovery cannot be negated by sand. Fire Punch hurts opposing Steel-types to make sure that Jirachi cannot be easily trapped and worn down by Magneton and doesn't let Skarmory and Forretress set Spikes up too freely. Thanks to Serene Grace and Jirachi's longevity, it can also fish for burns by spamming Fire Punch, which can be very rewarding if it manages to catch the likes of Tyranitar and Swampert looking for free opportunities to get onto the field. Jirachi can make full use of its ability with Body Slam's increased paralysis chance. An important application of this move is against Dugtrio, as Jirachi is likely to survive an Earthquake from full health and can win one-on-one by paralyzing Dugtrio with Body Slam and getting rid of it with another afterwards. Toxic is an alternative that allows Jirachi to cripple Pokemon such as non-Refresh Swampert and can be spread fairly easily due to Jirachi's ability to scare off most Poison-immune Pokemon with Fire Punch. Toxic is especially awkward for Pokemon such as Tyranitar, which doesn't mind being paralyzed nearly as much depending on its set, but should be kept in mind that dropping Body Slam makes Jirachi much weaker to Dugtrio.</p> <p>Leftovers is the item of choice for any defensively oriented Pokemon. The given EV spread allows Jirachi to take an Earthquake from +1 Adamant Salamence while being able to tank most special hits with ease. Another option is 128 EVs in Defense, which guarantees that Jirachi can take an Earthquake from Choice Band Adamant Dugtrio. Should Jirachi be running Toxic instead of Body Slam, the nature of choice should be Calm instead of Sassy, and it is an option to invest up to 32 EVs in Speed in order to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar and Swampert. Alternatively, with more EVs in Defense and a Bold nature, Jirachi can sit in front of defensive Swampert and slowly wear it down with Toxic, at the cost of giving up Jirachi's ability to wall most specially offensive threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Jirachi fits well into a variety of bulky teams where it can support its teammates with Wish. Pokemon that appreciate this kind of help include all-out offensive or Choice Band variants of Tyranitar and Salamence as well as defensive teammates like Suicune, Swampert, Forretress, and Claydol. Suicune and Swampert in particular greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to switch into Choice Band users like Aerodactyl and Salamence locked into Hidden Power Flying or Double-Edge, as it can ease the offensive pressure they have to handle. This help is enhanced by Wish, which can enable them to take care of most variants of Tyranitar, Salamence, Metagross, and Flygon that tend to threaten Jirachi. Skarmory is also a good teammate, as it can obtain free layers of Spikes by switching onto Earthquakes aimed at Jirachi while enjoying Wish to back it up. Unlike Blissey, defensive Jirachi doesn't mind Focus Punch or Explosion from Gengar, but it lacks Natural Cure and thus wants to avoid Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave from the various threats it is supposed to handle. Therefore, specific answers such as Flygon, which generally has the upper hand against Thunder Wave Zapdos and can switch into Earthquake aimed at Jirachi, and Pursuit Tyranitar, which can usually afford to take Will-O-Wisp from Gengar and proceed to pressure it on top of providing additional passive damage for Jirachi to take advantage of through sand, are two teammates of choice. Jirachi is a frequent member on teams that use many hovering Pokemon to avoid Spikes damage due to simultaneously having a Rock-type resistance, the bulk for tanking Electric-type attacks, and Wish support. Zapdos frequently features on these teams due to forming a specially defensive synergistic core with Jirachi by dealing with almost all Electric- and Water-types and pivoting into Metagross.</p> <p>Jirachi is also setup fodder for Curse Snorlax and bulky variants of Calm Mind sweepers like Suicune. As a result, it is a good idea to pack a phazer like Zapdos, Tyranitar, Perish Song Celebi, or, once again, Skarmory. Jirachi is also unable to break through Refresh users such as Swampert and Milotic, so packing something that can take advantage of these such as Celebi, Cloyster, or, to a lesser extent, Skarmory is a good idea. More offensive Pokemon that enjoy Jirachi's ability to spread paralysis such as Heracross, Machamp, Marowak, and Rhydon can also be considered.</p>"
        },
        "Wish + Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With this set, Jirachi can turn into a bulky sweeper that can easily use Blissey as setup fodder and become very difficult to safely remove from the game. It makes for a great stallbreaker that is very difficult for defensive cores featuring the likes of Skarmory, Blissey, Milotic, and Claydol to handle. Wish may seem like a risky choice when not backed up by Protect, but it is reliable enough to take advantage of a lot of passive Pokemon in the metagame. Furthermore, the boost in Special Defense offered by Calm Mind increases the number of Pokemon on which Jirachi can set up. For instance, Timid Zapdos is unable to 4HKO this Jirachi variant after a Calm Mind, giving it plenty of opportunities to heal itself with Wish if Zapdos doesn't have Roar. Another noteworthy application of Wish is against Dugtrio, as Jirachi can use Wish when Dugtrio switches in, stomach the first Earthquake, survive a second once it has been healed by Wish, and proceed to get rid of Dugtrio within the two turns. With only two moveslots for offensive options, this Jirachi variant may prefer Ice Punch and either Thunder or Thunderbolt to retain near-perfect coverage with two attacking moves. Due to its increased longevity with this set, Jirachi may value the universal coverage and the possibility to fish for freeze and paralysis thanks to Serene Grace over the immediate firepower, as it will likely get more Calm Mind boosts under its belt and can afford to miss Thunder at some point. Calm Mind-boosted Ice Punch also has the benefit of immediately threatening fast Earthquake users such as Dugtrio, Salamence, and Flygon that cannot OHKO Jirachi before getting OHKOed in return, while Thunder has a relatively high chance to inflict paralysis and gives Jirachi the upper hand against phazers such as Skarmory and Suicune. Nonetheless, Psychic remains an option, as it can discourage Heracross and Gengar, and the damage difference can be significant when dealing with Snorlax. Thunderbolt is a safer alternative to Thunder, while Fire Punch threatens Steel-types and Celebi and can be spammed to inflict burns, which can be really awkward for a Tyranitar attempting to take advantage of a Jirachi that can't hit it at least neutrally. Hidden Power Grass remains an option if getting rid of Swampert and damaging Tyranitar is a priority, at the cost of leaving Jirachi with otherwise severely lacking coverage.</p> <p>Leftovers is crucial to this set's success, as its recovery isn't negated by sand. The given spread gives Jirachi as much physical bulk as possible and enables it to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar, which, in tandem with Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind, makes it very sturdy overall. Most notably, the physical bulk lets Jirachi endure powerful Earthquakes, the most common way to take it out. For instance, Adamant Salamence, Metagross, and Tyranitar all fail to 2HKO Jirachi with Earthquake. However, giving it more Special Defense can be useful to set up on Pokemon such as Zapdos, Gengar, and Suicune more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi performs well alongside Suicune, which can handle the various Earthquake users such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Salamence, Aerodactyl, and Flygon most of time. Suicune also appreciates Wish support to help it deal with the aforementioned threats and Jirachi's ability to switch in on their STAB attacks if they're packing a Choice Band. Consequently, Pokemon that can take advantage of Earthquake aimed at Jirachi such as Gengar, Zapdos, Salamence, and Flygon are good partners. Choice Band Salamence in particular is a noteworthy Wish recipient. Other Pokemon that allow Jirachi to sweep more easily and benefit from Wish include Spikers such as Skarmory, spinners like Claydol, and Tyranitar, which provides help against Snorlax and Suicune in the case of a Calm Mind war by virtue of sand and potentially Roar. As this Jirachi set lacks coverage moves, Dugtrio is a good partner to remove Tyranitar, Metagross, and opposing Jirachi. It also helps against Celebi and Magneton, the latter of which could try to cripple Jirachi with Thunder Wave. Finally, Jirachi may expose itself to Thunder Wave from the likes of Blissey and Zapdos and Will-O-Wisp from Gengar while trying to set up. Therefore, Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Blissey can be considered to alleviate this issue.</p>"
        },
        "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With its immunity to sand and base 100 HP stat, Jirachi makes good use of Substitute. This move allows it to set up on the likes of Blissey, which notably cannot break its Substitute with Seismic Toss, Milotic, some variants of Snorlax and Zapdos, and Porygon2 without having to worry about a potential paralysis. It also shuts down Celebi's attempts to cripple it with Leech Seed, and if Jirachi manages to keep the Substitute, it can defeat its usual revenge killers, most notably Dugtrio. After two Calm Mind boosts, the Substitute is able to tank a Thunderbolt from Zapdos and a Fire Punch from Gengar. Psychic is recommended on this set, as the raw power and potential drop in Special Defense made more likely by Serene Grace really improve the matchup against Blissey and Snorlax, and directly threatening Pokemon like Gengar and Heracross can also make a significant difference. Fire Punch is usually the preferred coverage move in the last slot, as it hits important targets such as Skarmory, Metagross, Celebi, Magneton, and opposing Jirachi super effectively. While the inability to hit Tyranitar neutrally is bothersome, the chance of burning it with Fire Punch is something to keep in mind. Thunderbolt is an option that hits Suicune, Skarmory, and Moltres very hard. It pairs well with Ice Punch, which can be used over Psychic, as it directly threatens Salamence and Flygon and is Jirachi's best special attack to damage Claydol. While it offers near-perfect coverage alongside Thunder or Thunderbolt, dropping Psychic makes Jirachi less likely to get past Blissey and Snorlax. Hidden Power Grass is an option if getting past Swampert and, to a lesser extent, Tyranitar is really necessary, but it comes with huge coverage issues.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Jirachi's Substitute doesn't fall to a Seismic Toss from Blissey or a Thunderbolt from defensive Zapdos after a Calm Mind. The investment in Defense ensures that Jirachi can stomach an Earthquake from Choice Band Dugtrio from full health. 136 EVs in Speed let Jirachi outspeed Adamant Heracross, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack with a Modest nature to hit relatively hard. 148 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are enough to outspeed neutral-natured Pokemon sitting at base 100 Speed such as Salamence, Zapdos, and Celebi. Other Speed benchmarks include 176 EVs to get the edge over Moltres. Leftovers is the mandatory item, as the recovery provided allows Jirachi to get more attempts to use Substitute.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar provides residual damage in the form of sand, which helps Jirachi immensely against Blissey, Snorlax, and Suicune. Tyranitar can also check these by itself in a pinch. Dugtrio's ability to trap and remove troublesome Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Metagross, Snorlax, opposing Jirachi, and weakened Blissey can be key to this set's success. Snorlax does a good job luring in Tyranitar and Metagross and can put them into KO range of Jirachi with Focus Punch, Self-Destruct, or Earthquake, and it might even manage to take them out entirely with Curse + Self-Destruct. Sleep inducers such as Breloom and Venusaur can cripple the likes of Claydol and Tyranitar should the opponent think that they can essentially sacrifice them instead of a seemingly more important Pokemon, which is highly beneficial for Jirachi. Jirachi is a prime candidate on teams focused around Calm Mind sweepers, as it can weaken or take advantage of the likes of Blissey, non-Perish Song Celebi, and Snorlax, which tend to be troublesome for this kind of team. Consequently, Suicune and Celebi make good partners, as they can damage their shared checks and provide an appealing defensive presence against the likes of Tyranitar, Swampert, and Metagross, which usually keep Jirachi in check. Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard are also pretty effective at pressuring physical offense teams featuring the aforementioned threats. In return, Jirachi can take advantage of walls like Milotic and Blissey, which give Fire-types trouble. On the other hand, Tyranitar and Swampert are also good partners, as they tend to attract opposing Swampert and can badly damage it with Hidden Power Grass, something that Jirachi greatly appreciates. Finally, while Jirachi can take out faster Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Jolly Salamence, Flygon, and especially Dugtrio if it's covered by Substitute, these can still threaten it with a powerful Earthquake if that's not the case. Thus, Pokemon that can take advantage of these once they're locked into Earthquake such as Gengar, Zapdos, and Salamence, as well as general physically defensive Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune, can be good backups.</p>"
        },
        "Mixed": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jirachi can go with a more immediately offensive approach with this set, which can act as a lure and be very awkward to deal with in spite of luck playing a significant part in this set's success. Dynamic Punch is a key move on this variant, as it allows Jirachi to secure a 2HKO on Tyranitar and, with sand on the field, a 2HKO on maximum Defense Blissey and a 3HKO on most Snorlax variants. The induced confusion makes it even more difficult for them to heal or retaliate. However, its iffy accuracy can ruin the surprise factor and thus affect the overall reliability of this set. Body Slam, coupled with Serene Grace, has a good chance to paralyze the opposing Pokemon, including Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert. Even though the move itself isn't very powerful, it can be useful as an offensive measure against a very weakened Blissey or Snorlax when betting on Dynamic Punch can be avoided. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, trades the ability to hinder Ground-types for a guaranteed paralysis on every Pokemon that is not immune to Normal-type moves, most notably Gengar. Paralysis is a good way to cripple what Jirachi can't hit super effectively due to four-moveslot syndrome, potentially makes missing with Dynamic Punch less punishing should full paralysis occur, and, coupled with confusion inflicted by Dynamic Punch, can make this Jirachi variant difficult to hit. Substitute is a less common option over Dynamic Punch or Body Slam that eliminates prediction and enhances Jirachi's ability to deal with Blissey by blocking its status moves and Seismic Toss, possibly allowing Jirachi to fire off multiple Dynamic Punches without worrying about missing.</p> <p>Fire Punch does a good amount of damage to Steel-types such as Metagross, Skarmory, Magneton, and opposing Jirachi while also threatening Celebi and Heracross. Hidden Power Grass dents Swampert and hits Claydol relatively hard. This set is extremely customizable, and there are plenty of options available. Body Slam or Thunder Wave can be dropped in favor of another coverage attack; Psychic can be considered to invalidate Gengar and do more damage to Heracross, while Thunder allows Jirachi to hit Skarmory while pressuring Milotic and Suicune more effectively and can inflict paralysis at a decent rate, though relying on another inaccurate move can lead to dicey situations. Nonetheless, Thunder provides both desirable coverage and paralysis and thus opens up another moveslot like Substitute or Hidden Power Grass. Ice Punch grants good coverage alongside Thunder and threatens Salamence and Flygon with an OHKO while dealing a good amount of damage to Zapdos, Claydol, and Celebi.</p> <p>The investment in Attack is needed to reliably 2HKO Blissey with Dynamic Punch. 136 EVs in Speed allow Jirachi to outrun maximum Speed Heracross and Suicune with a neutral nature. The rest is dumped into Special Attack alongside a Mild nature to maximize Jirachi's damage output with its coverage moves. The EV spread is highly customizable. Maximum Speed with or without a Hasty nature can be considered to outspeed other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Salamence, Zapdos, Celebi, and Flygon that choose not to maximize their Speed stat as well. Other relevant benchmarks include 32 EVs to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar and 56 EVs to get the jump over maximum Speed Adamant Claydol. If using Substitute, running 252 EVs in HP ensures that the Substitute can stand a Seismic Toss. Leftovers is the item of choice to increase Jirachi's longevity, which can be important against bulky teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jirachi greatly appreciates sand to get some notable KOs and another source of passive damage that adds up to the confusion induced by Dynamic Punch. Therefore, Tyranitar is a teammate of choice that in return will greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to potentially lure out and cripple the likes of Swampert, Flygon, and Metagross. Pursuit variants can also threaten Pokemon such as Gengar and Celebi that can be awkward for Jirachi to fight due to their access to Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, respectively, as well as Jirachi's inability to scare them off most of the time. Zapdos is another good partner due to its typing synergy with Jirachi and ability to scare off Milotic, which can be difficult for Jirachi to break through. In return, Jirachi can potentially heavily damage Tyranitar, Blissey, and Snorlax, something that Zapdos greatly appreciates. Since Jirachi is prone to being trapped and taken out by Dugtrio and targeted by strong Earthquake users in general, other hovering Pokemon such as Salamence, Gengar, and Flygon that can take advantage of Pokemon locked into Earthquake can be considered. Spikers such as Skarmory and Cloyster provide yet another form of residual damage that Jirachi appreciates when trying to break through bulky Pokemon. Finally, since this Jirachi can take several Pokemon such as Swampert, Flygon, and Suicune by surprise and badly cripple them with paralysis or its coverage move, late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance variants of Tyranitar and Salamence as well as Agility Metagross can benefit from Jirachi's wallbreaking abilities.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Deoxys-A is the best cleaner and revenge killer in Ubers, with the offense to 2HKO most Pokemon in the tier and the Speed to outspeed them all, besides weather sweepers. Its relative ease to keep hidden in the back of a team, combined with the stark variation between its three potential held items, keeps opponents guessing. To back up these traits, Deoxys-A also has an exotic and powerful movepool with everything from Ice Beam to Superpower and Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed's priority, especially, is scarce and invaluable for extra protection against some of the tier's greatest endgame threats, such as Salac Berry Groudon, Salac Berry Kyogre, weather sweepers, and opposing Deoxys-A. However, Deoxys-A remains the ultimate glass cannon, with zero defensive utility outside of priority. It therefore requires revenge killing or smart pivots to get it into play. Additionally, teams explicitly structure themselves against Deoxys-A's movepool by combining Normal-types, Steel-types, and a Fighting-resistant Pokemon, thereby forcing prediction when using a Choice Band or Superpower.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Physical Deoxys-A has a fourth moveslot that is rather flexible, but most of the other moves it gets, such as Psycho Boost, Focus Punch, Spikes, and Knock Off, are far less useful that what's already been discussed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross and Jirachi resist most of Deoxys-A's moves, and they can take a Superpower or Thunder. Metagross is one of the few Deoxys-A switch-ins, boasting good bulk and the ability to KO or even Pursuit trap it. Jirachi has slightly less physical bulk and lacks Pursuit. Forretress and Skarmory share most of their resistances, are also neutral to Superpower, and have high physical bulk, but a +1 Thunder KOes them. Skarmory can also phaze Substitute variants.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Kyogre and Groudon</strong>: Although they struggle against the SubPetaya set, defensive Kyogre and Groudon can comfortably tank physical Deoxys-A's attacks, being major obstacles for a successful clean.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: In addition to Metagross, Pokemon such as Dusclops, Tyranitar, and opposing Deoxys-A can threaten it with Pursuit, and the former two can switch into some of Deoxys-A's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Ho-Oh and Lugia</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh and Lugia have the physical bulk to take most physical attacks and are effective against Petaya Berry Deoxys-A in sun, but they can fall to Rock Slide and/or Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Latias</strong>: It does take major damage from a Choice Band-boosted Shadow Ball, but defensive Latias can tank any Deoxys-A attack and KO back with Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Swampert</strong>: Bulky and difficult for Deoxys-A to hit effectively, especially for the SubPetaya set, Swampert can tank Deoxys-A's attacks and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Extreme Speed users such as Rayquaza and opposing Deoxys-A, as well as Deoxys-S and weather sweepers such as Omastar, Exeggutor, Kabutops, Qwilfish, and Shiftry, are the only Pokemon that can attack before Deoxys-A. Omastar and Kabutops especially resist Extreme Speed and have good physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Although a somewhat uncommon move, Protect can scout out Choice Band Deoxys-A's moves, allowing for a safe response.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Spell Tag": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spell Tag gives a small power boost to Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball, which lets Deoxys-A always OHKO Latios and substantially increases its chance at KOing a chipped Latias, while still allowing it to switch between moves. This lets it unleash a surprise coverage move and clean or wallbreak more flexibly. Extreme Speed grants some protection against the few Pokemon capable of revenge killing Deoxys-A, such as Rayquaza, Omastar, Qwilfish, Kabutops, Exeggutor, Shiftry, and opposing Deoxys-A. In addition to Latios and Latias, Shadow Ball also hits Mewtwo, Lugia, Gengar, Shedinja, and Dusclops. Superpower is how Deoxys-A smacks Normal- and Steel-types and is Spell Tag Deoxys-A's strongest move. Rock Slide is great for teams that need to more easily handle Ho-Oh, and it can fish for free turns when paired with paralysis spreaders. Fire Punch pairs with sun teams to deal major damage to conventional Deoxys-A checks such as Forretress, Skarmory, Metagross, and Jirachi. Thunder is a good counterpart for rain teams, making surprising use of Deoxys-A's high Special Attack against Pokemon such as Kyogre and Skarmory. Solar Beam is also an option for teams that really need Deoxys-A to blast through Groudon, and Pursuit helps it securely revenge kill Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, and potentially other Deoxys-A. Extreme Speed can be potentially dropped for another coverage move on teams that don't necessarily need the extra revenge killing potential. A Jolly nature may be used to provide additional protection against opposing Deoxys-A. Run a Lonely nature if using a special attack such as Fire Punch, Thunder, Solar Beam, or Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spell Tag Deoxys-A fits on a wide range of teams, from hyper offense to bulky offense and balance teams, and it requires no specific support. Because Spell Tag Deoxys-A is somewhat customizable in regards to what threats it can bypass, its teammates more often determine the set than the other way around. Common major obstacles for Deoxys-A are Steel-types, most notably Pursuit Metagross, so Magneton and Dugtrio are good choices to trap them, and they make a move choice such as Rock Slide more appealing. A full-health Kyogre or Groudon is an effective check when not running Thunder or Solar Beam, so Spikes setters such as Forretress, Skarmory, Omastar, and Qwilfish are highly effective, and they double as a way to get residual damage on Steel-types. Physical attackers that place strain on defensive Kyogre, Groudon, defensive Latias, and/or Steel-types are also good partners, such as Curse Snorlax, offensive Groudon sets, and Choice Band users such as Metagross, Snorlax, Ho-Oh, Heracross, Rayquaza, and Lugia. Deoxys-A also appreciates a team structure that can combat opposing weather sweepers, so running Groudon, Kyogre, or both is highly recommended.</p>"
        },
        "Choice Band": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band maximizes Deoxys-A's power to bust through bulky threats, especially Kyogre and Groudon, when cleaning or wallbreaking. Extreme Speed grants some protection against the few Pokemon capable of revenge killing Deoxys-A, such as Rayquaza, weather sweepers, and opposing Deoxys-A. Shadow Ball is mainly for Latios and Latias, but it also hits Mewtwo, Lugia, Gengar, Shedinja, and Dusclops, and it is fairly spammable if Normal-types have been eliminated. Superpower is how Deoxys-A breaks through Normal- and Steel-types, but it can be unfavorable to lock into due to Ghost-types, Latios, Latias, and the Attack drops. Double-Edge is the strongest reliable move available to Deoxys-A, dealing high damage to key targets such as Kyogre, Groudon, and Ho-Oh without locking Deoxys-A into Superpower or Shadow Ball, moves which more common foes are resistant or immune to. Rock Slide is for teams that need to more easily bypass Ho-Oh, and it can fish for free turns when paired with paralysis spreaders. Fire Punch can be used on sun teams to surprise typical Choice Band Deoxys-A switch-ins, such as Forretress, Skarmory, Metagross, and Jirachi. Pursuit is also a worthy option to securely revenge kill Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, and potentially other Deoxys-A. A Jolly nature may be used to provide additional protection against opposing Deoxys-A. Run a Lonely nature if using a special attack such as Fire Punch or Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Deoxys-A fits on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as the most immediately powerful cleaner around. The major obstacles for its cleaning are Pokemon that deny it from easily clicking Double-Edge or Shadow Ball, which are primarily Steel-types, especially Pursuit Metagross. Magneton, Dugtrio, and Spikes setters, such as Forretress, Skarmory, Omastar, and Qwilfish, are highly effective at trapping and removing them or chipping them down. Physical attackers that place strain on defensive Kyogre, Groudon, defensive Latias, and/or Steel-types are also good partners, softening up these targets for Deoxys-A to clean; Curse Snorlax, offensive Groudon sets, and Choice Band users such as Metagross, Snorlax, Ho-Oh, Heracross, Rayquaza, and Lugia all accomplish this. Some of the few Pokemon that can outspeed Deoxys-A are weather sweepers, so running Groudon, Kyogre, or both is highly recommended to help keep the weather in your favor. Blissey is also a notable partner, as it can stonewall most Latios and Latias sets, giving Deoxys-A a safe switch into these threats if it's locked into Superpower.</p>"

        "SubPetaya": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Substitute eases Deoxys-A's reliance on prediction and also allows it to activate Petaya Berry, which turns it into a powerful specially-based cleaner. BoltBeam covers most of the tier, and with maximum Special Attack investment, Ice Beam even OHKOes Latios when boosted. Superpower bypasses BoltBeam checks such as Blissey, Snorlax, Tyranitar, Regice, and Umbreon. A Hasty nature allows Deoxys-A to outspeed standard Salac Berry Groudon and Heracross at the cost of some power, which is notable for teams weak to these threats. 30 HP IVs are utilized to activate Petaya Berry on the third Substitute. Thunderbolt can be used instead of Thunder if using this set without rain support, but it is substantially less likely to secure KOs on Kyogre and Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set functions best when using Thunder, which entails a rain team with Kyogre, and like with physical Deoxys-A, this set also appreciates Kyogre helping neutralize sun sweepers. A rain sweeper such as Omastar or Qwilfish can provide a defense against opposing Deoxys-A. SubPetaya Deoxys-A cannot hit Shedinja, so Spikes support from Forretress, Skarmory, Omastar, or Qwilfish is essential, and this also helps pressure Steel-types. Steel-types that take neutral damage from Superpower and Thunder, like Metagross, are also effective checks to this set, so running Magneton or Dugtrio to trap them is also effective.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Deoxys-D has very good mixed defenses and an amazing movepool. It can check a number of threats resiliently with Recover, most notably Latios as well as Metagross, Rayquaza, and Mewtwo lacking Substitute. Unlike other Spikes users, Deoxys-D has acceptable lead matchups, often getting Spikes up early in the game. Knock Off and Spikes are both widely although not immediately threatening, and a fast Taunt lets it beat Pokemon that are otherwise hard to reliably counter. As Deoxys-D at worst trades with Explosion and Self-Destruct users, it protects more valuable members of its team from those moves. Pressure is a very useful ability, letting it reduce opposing Pokemon's PP quickly to make them either have to stop attacking Deoxys-D or risk being unable to damage its teammates.</p> <p>Nevertheless, its excellent movepool leaves it with more useful moves than it has moveslots for. On stall, it is often in competition with Ho-Oh for a teamslot, as it also absorbs Explosion and Self-Destruct reliably and is capable of making progress while furthermore being a reliable Deoxys-A check. Unlike Ho-Oh, Deoxys-D threatens with long-term progress rather than with immediate damage, leaving it vulnerable to setup from SubCM Pokemon and Curse + Rest Snorlax. Finally, Deoxys-D cannot be used alongside the overall much better Deoxys-A, not only precluding the latter as a team option on offense but often immediately telegraphing your lack of Deoxys-A to your opponent; thus, Deoxys-D fits best on stall teams wanting to make use of its slow progress and ability to absorb Explosion and Self-Destruct. However, Deoxys-D can also be used on offense teams wanting Spikes up as quickly as possible.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive spread is viable, which lets Deoxys-D check Metagross and Rayquaza more effectively at the peril of being weaker to lead Mewtwo; it fits best on teams that otherwise can handle Mewtwo well. Fire Punch on the stall set can hit Forretress and Metagross much harder but cannot hit Mewtwo. A set with Cosmic Power, Recover, Seismic Toss, and Taunt or Knock Off can very reliably wall lead Mewtwo and Metagross, but it loses an important utility moveslot. Night Shade can be used instead of Seismic Toss, especially if Deoxys-D is not running Knock Off, to hit Gengar on teams that have difficulty with it, but this leaves Deoxys-D unable to directly harm Snorlax and Blissey. If it's not running Taunt, Night Shade is preferable, as even with Seismic Toss, Deoxys-D cannot beat Blissey or Rest Snorlax without Taunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Heracross</strong>: Heracross's Megahorn threatens to KO Deoxys-D, giving Heracross a free hit on its team's check or else a chance to set up. Heracross will often either let a layer of Spikes get set up on the switch or lose its item, however.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attacks</strong>: Deoxys-D's mixed bulk isn't quite sufficient to take the strongest attacks in the tier, so attacks like Modest Kyogre's Hydro Pump and Deoxys-A's Shadow Ball can threaten Deoxys-D out if the opponent can get their check in safely. Switching into Deoxys-D risks allowing a layer of Spikes being set up or losing an item, however.</p> <p><strong>Forretress</strong>: Forretress can spin Deoxys-D's Spikes away, but it will lose its item and potentially take a Seismic Toss or two or even a Fire Punch. Losing Forretress's health may not be a worthwhile trade when you're playing against stall, and it cannot reliably keep Spikes off against Deoxys-D.</p> <p><strong>Setup</strong>: Deoxys-D's counterplay to setup Pokemon is limited, mostly consisting of Seismic Toss and Taunt. Setup Pokemon that can bypass these, such as a SubCM user faster than Deoxys-D like Mewtwo or one that can paralyze Deoxys-D and heal like Rest / Curse / Body Slam Snorlax, can boost on it. Even a slower setup Pokemon can force Deoxys-D to use Taunt every second turn and attack twice, usually enough to outdamage Deoxys-D's Recover.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Deoxys-D is vulnerable to status, particularly those from Taunt-bypassing moves such as Body Slam, those inflicted by Pokemon faster than Deoxys-D, and those inflicted as Deoxys-D switches in.</p> <p><strong>Recovery</strong>: On stall teams, Deoxys-D's ability to threaten foes is limited to Spikes, Knock Off, and Seismic Toss, so a team that has reliable Spikes counterplay or is willing to accept Spikes damage can allow a Pokemon with a recovery move such as Ho-Oh or Lugia to lose its item and thereafter wall Deoxys-D.</p>",

        "Stall Lead": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>On stall, Deoxys-D pressures Metagross and lead Mewtwo enough to usually force them to either switch out or use Explosion or Self-Destruct, and it uses its excellent movepool to make incremental progress. Knock Off debilitates Latios and Latias and scares nearly every other Pokemon long-term, but it can only affect each Pokemon once. Knock Off and Spikes, whether the latter is on Deoxys-D or a teammate, pair well if you can remove Leftovers from Metagross, Snorlax, Forretress, Kyogre, and Groudon, as these Pokemon will quickly accrue damage through Spikes without being cushioned by Leftovers. Taunt prevents setup from Groudon and Forretress and Toxic from Blissey as well as Encore from Wobbuffet. Seismic Toss lets Deoxys-D threaten Mewtwo enough to usually force it to switch or use Self-Destruct, as well as letting Deoxys-D check Metagross and wear down Forretress. Alternatively, Toxic lets Deoxys-D stall out Mewtwo leads by removing their Lum Berries, badly poisoning them, then repeatedly healing with Recover, and it trades the ability to hit Metagross for greater damage over time for the ability to threaten Pokemon that can set up, as they switch in and push through Pokemon that can otherwise wall Deoxys-D via recovery. While Deoxys-D is generally very effective against slower-paced teams, Spikes combined with Knock Off is particularly valuable against Forretress, as the opponent is forced to either allow their Forretress to lose its Leftovers and thereby usually lose the Spikes game long-term or accept Spikes immediately and lose it short-term. Taunt similarly lets Deoxys-D pressure defensive teams very effectively, forcing them to switch or waste attacking PP.</p> <p>96 Speed EVs let Deoxys-D outpace neutral-natured Metagross, letting it check Metagross more reliably, and many Kyogre and Groudon, allowing it to usually prevent their setup; the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to better check Mewtwo and Latios and almost always avoid being 2HKOed by +2 Modest Mewtwo's Ice Beam. If Deoxys-D is running Taunt, a faster spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature lets it outspeed every Metagross, almost all Kyogre and Groudon, Adamant Rayquaza, Heracross, and Smeargle, completely neutralizing the latter; the reduced Special Defense investment leaves it less resilient to Mewtwo's and Latios's attacks, however. Deoxys-D is vulnerable to all forms of status, particularly paralysis from Latios's Thunder, and care must be taken to avoid risking status landing on it.</p> <p>Deoxys-D can drop Seismic Toss entirely for a third utility move if its team has a strong Mewtwo and Metagross check otherwise. This set can function in a teamslot that is not the lead, which allows its team to lead Groudon and both get up sun early and obscure the teamstyle briefly. If you're facing a lead Mewtwo, Deoxys-D will lose one turn to check it, but the presence of sun will prevent freezing and discourage Thunder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey's Heal Bell is valuable to remove the status that Deoxys-D struggles with, and it can check Latios and Latias more sturdily in place of Deoxys-D if it is weakened or eliminated or if rain is up. Forretress's Rapid Spin prevents Deoxys-D's team from being worn down by Spikes. Forretress's Spikes makes it easier for Deoxys-D to forgo using it. Groudon's sun discourages Thunder, making Deoxys-D a much more reliable switch-in to Latios. Deoxys-D can be run with Kyogre, as the former is in competition with Ho-Oh for a teamslot, which ought not be run alongside Kyogre. Kyogre, however, makes Deoxys-D much more vulnerable to Latios. Resilient checks to Heracross, Snorlax, and SubCM Pokemon such as Lugia, Bulk Up Groudon, and Latias, respectively, are all necessary to alleviate the weaknesses Deoxys-D has to these Pokemon.</p>"

        "Offense Lead": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>On offense, Deoxys-D's job is to quickly set Spikes versus most common leads. Taunt both prevents Pokemon like Kyogre and Groudon from setting up while Deoxys-D sets Spikes and blocks Forretress's attempts to set its own Spikes, and it's particularly useful against defensive teams, letting Deoxys-D waste foes' PP, spread damage around, and get Spikes up more reliably. Fire Punch or Seismic Toss hits Forretress if it attempts to prevent Spikes, with the former hitting it harder but having narrower general application and leaving Deoxys-D weaker to Mewtwo. Recover allows Deoxys-D to act as a stronger defensive piece and potentially set Spikes later in the game if they are removed, making it overall the most valuable move in the last moveslot, while Thunder Wave discourages setup and provides a Speed advantage or a free turn to your incoming Pokemon, and Knock Off allows Deoxys-D to hit Latios very hard. It is possible to use Psycho Boost in this slot to reduce Deoxys-D's weakness to Heracross. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are sufficient to let Deoxys-D outspeed Kyogre and Groudon almost always, Heracross, and Adamant Rayquaza, and 252 HP and 4 Special Defense EVs give Deoxys-D excellent mixed bulk. A Calm nature is possible, letting Deoxys-D check Latios more effectively in exchange for worse matchups against Substitute Salac Berry Groudon, Heracross, and Rayquaza.</p> <p>Because Deoxys-D is valuable on offense to set Spikes early and reliably, care should be taken when building and playing to prevent Forretress from spinning or at least make them trade significant progress to spin away. If it's not running Recover, Deoxys-D cannot reliably set Spikes later in the game, so allowing the foe to spin should particularly be avoided.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Groudon's sun is crucial to allow Deoxys-D's teammates to KO Forretress with Fire-type moves before it can spin. Sun also allows Deoxys-D to more reliably check Latios if Deoxys-D is using Recover. Ho-Oh acts as a switch-in to Heracross, which comes in on Deoxys-D and threatens to KO it. Rayquaza provides priority to the team and potentially both wallbreaking and cleaning ability. Gengar can spinblock, significantly improving the team's ability to keep Spikes up against Forretress.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Probably the worst Uber. Offensive sets are either a poor man's Deoxys-A or a poor man's Mewtwo, and defensive sets wish they were Deoxys-D. At least it has Speed going for it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Oh lordy, this Pokemon can do a lot. It can pull off Counter or Mirror Coat (best used with Recover). Deoxys-S gets Light Screen, Reflect, and Safeguard, and it has the Speed to use any of these. Substitute is an option for most Pokemon, but especially things with a lot of Speed, and this Pokemon is all about the Speed. Rock Slide works if you are lucky and want to flinch, as Deoxys-S is fast enough to flinch anything, and it hits both Ho-Oh and Rayquaza. Pursuit is available for other Psychic-types, especially Deoxys-A, but it needs to be used carefully, as some of those Pokemon can do some damage to Deoxys-S if they know it has Pursuit and stay in (you need 172 Special Attack EVs to have a chance to OHKO and 248 Special Attack EVs and a +Special Attack nature to always OHKO a Deoxys-A that stays in). Snatch always allows for some creativity, so don't be afraid to get creative with Deoxys-S.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For most sets, you'll want to get to 440 Speed to be faster than +Speed Deoxys-A, which requires 16 Speed EVs and a Speed boosting nature or 176 EVs and a neutral nature. Offensive sets should go for maxing the attacking stats, and defensive sets should max HP and then focus on the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The most reliable counter is probably Forretress. It can Rapid Spin away Spikes, is immune to Toxic, doesn't take much from physical attacks, doesn't take much from special attacks except Thunder and Fire Punch, and can easily 2HKO with STAB Hidden Power Bug. Tyranitar and Snorlax beat Deoxys-S that lack Superpower. Blissey can stop anything without Taunt or Superpower. Groudon with max HP is rarely 2HKOed by Ice Beam, and it can OHKO or 2HKO back with Earthquake (guaranteed OHKO if it is Choice Banded). Kyogre 2HKOes Deoxys-S with Surf even if it gets a Calm Mind in (it OHKOes otherwise), but it is 2HKOed by Thunder after Deoxys-S uses Calm Mind. It won't take much damage from anything else, however. Latias and Latios can Calm Mind up against any special attacker and easily beat it with their high Special Defense, but hate Knock Off variants. Ho-Oh beats any Deoxys-S that does not have Rock Slide.</p>",

Deoxys-S has the Speed to come in on some other Calm Mind users and win any Calm Mind war by Taunting any attempts by the enemy to Calm Mind. The only way this can backfire is if the enemy Calm Minds once while Deoxys-S switches in and is a Pokemon that has a strong non-Psychic attack to hurt Deoxys-S with, such as Latias, Latios, and Kyogre. Other than that, the fastest Taunt user in the game ruins a lot of stuff; try it out and have fun.</p>"}
